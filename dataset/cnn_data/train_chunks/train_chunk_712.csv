A glowing lagoon off Puerto Rico's northeastern coast has gone almost completely dark and biologists have no idea why. The Fajardo Grand Lagoon in Las Cabezas de San Juan usually glows when bioluminescent organisms that live in the water are disturbed, yet they have not been visible for at least nine days. Nearby construction work is thought to have caused disruption to the area, but biologists also believe a recent spate of bad weather could have caused the glowing lagoon to dull. The Fajardo Grand Lagoon, pictured, usually glows when bioluminescent organisms are disturbed, but has been dark for at least nine days. Scientists are unsure why but theories suggest nearby construction work may have disrupted water in the lagoon. It went dark in 2003 before glowing again a few months later . The bioluminescent lagoon is often referred to as a bay and is a popular tourist attraction. Visitors row kayaks or take boat trips from the nearby city of Fajardo in Las Cabezas de San Juan to watch the water glow. The lagoon is filled with one-celled organisms said to be half-animal and half-plant called dinoflagellates that glow like fireflies when the water is disturbed. These organisms are bioluminescent thanks to an enzyme called luciferase. The name comes from Lucifer and is Latin for lucem ferrem, which means 'light-bearer'. Bioluminescent organisms can regulate how much light they produce by using different lucieferases in a range of ways. In the Fajardo lagoon, a greenish-blue light swirls off hands and arms as visitors trail them through the water and the glow increases when boats are sailed through it. Another theory is the chopping down of mangrove trees in the area, to let larger boats into the lagoon and its surrounding water, could also have played a part. 'We have been compiling data,' Carmen Guerrero, secretary of the Department of Natural Resources said. 'There are a lot of factors that could be at play.'

The lagoon is filled with one-celled organisms said to be half-animal and half-plant that glow like fireflies if the water is disturbed. A greenish light swirls off hands and arms as visitors trail them through the water. However, the bioluminescence has dropped so significantly, tour operators have had to cancel trips and reimburse visitors, Guerrero added. Fajardo Mayor Anibal Melendez blamed surface runoff caused by nearby construction of a water and sewer treatment plant. He has since asked that the plant be . moved elsewhere, yet officials involved with the plant deny the work is . causing the lagoon's problems and the government . Environmental Quality Board added the . treatment plant has adequate erosion and sediment controls that 'comply with . environmental standards.'

Each lagoon is filled with organisms . called dinoflagellates that glow like fireflies when the water is . disturbed. These cause a greenish-blue light to appear when boats sail . through it . Recent rains and a storm that are generating heavy waves is another possibility for affecting the lagoon's bioluminescence (pictured here, before the blackout) As a preventive measure, the government has temporarily suspended construction at the project for two weeks until scientists can figure out what is causing the problem. Alberto Lazaro, president of the state . Water and Sewer Authority, said he will evaluate scientists' findings . before deciding how to proceed in several weeks. Recent rains and a storm that are generating heavy waves is another possibility for affecting the lagoon's bioluminescence, continued Guerrero. The Conservation Trust of Puerto Rico, which manages the lagoon and surrounding areas, collects water samples three times a week to record data including temperature, salinity and precipitation. Scientists will analyse this data to help solve the mystery of the darkening lagoon. It is not the first time the lagoon has gone dark. It went nearly dark for a couple of months in 2003 but the glow was restored before scientists could establish the exact cause.","Fajardo lagoon usually glows when organisms in the water are disturbed .

Alan Watts, 65, (pictured outside Luton Crown Court) is on trial for the manslaughter of 64-year-old Brian Holmes after an alleged row in an Asda car park . A motorist killed a cancer survivor in a ‘moment of madness’ in a row over a disabled parking space, a jury heard. Alan Watts, 65, sarcastically shouted, ‘you look like you need a wheelchair’ when he saw Brian Holmes, 64, putting shopping in his car boot. He is accused of getting out of his Range Rover and lashing out with a ‘right-left combination’ in a show of ‘extraordinary violence’. Mr Holmes, who had been given the all-clear from cancer just days earlier, hit his head on the ground and died the next day in hospital. Prosecutor Ann Evans said Watts struck out in an ‘unprovoked violent outburst’. She said: ‘This is a case about how a moment of madness can change people’s lives for ever. The defendant, in a show of extraordinary violence, lashed out at Brian Holmes at a car park in Asda and killed him with a punch to the head.’ The jury was shown CCTV footage of the clash in Biggleswade, Bedfordshire, in August. Luton Crown Court heard yesterday that Watts goaded his victim after seeing his car parked in a disabled space and blocked him in with his four-wheel drive. He admitted to police that he leaned out of the window and made the sarcastic comment but claims he struck out in self-defence. Mrs Evans said Mr Holmes was placing . shopping from a nearby market in the car while his wife Christine went . ahead to the supermarket. Mrs Holmes, who suffers from rheumatoid arthritis, was the holder of a . blue disabled parking badge. ‘That was the last time she saw him . conscious and uninjured,’ Mrs Evans said. The camera filmed Watts punching his victim twice before he fell to the ground. He then drove away. Mrs . Evans said: ‘Within seconds Mr Holmes moves backwards away from the . door and Mr Watts gets out. Mr Holmes then backs away and Mr Watts walks . towards him closing the car door behind him.’ The court heard that just days before the alleged incident, Mr Holmes (left) had been told he had beaten cancer. Watts has pleaded not guilty to manslaughter, saying he acted in self-defence after Mr Holmes 'attacked him' She added: ‘Mr Watts raises his right arm and his torso twists, consistent with striking his right hand at Mr Holmes. ‘Mr Watts immediately raises his left arm, his torso twists again and the arm moves. Again consistent, you may conclude, with a right-left combination punch to Mr Holmes’ face. Mr Holmes immediately falls to the ground.’ Witnesses described seeing the defendant with clenched fists approaching his victim who tried to defend himself from the blows. Mr Holmes, a grandfather, from Sandy in Bedfordshire, was airlifted to Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge, where he died on August 4. But Crown prosecutor Ann Evans told the court during her opening address that Watts goaded Mr Holmes after seeing his car was parked in a disabled spot in the Asda car park before setting on him in an unprovoked attack . When Watts was arrested later that day, he told officers: ‘I can still hear it now – the man banged his head something chronic on the floor.’ He told police he acted in self-defence because Mr Holmes had tried to pull him out of his car and had grabbed his wrists. He claimed his victim was ‘effing and blinding’ and he suspected he was drunk. Mrs Evans said he told police he left immediately because he wanted to get his wife home and ‘didn’t know whether he was going to be attacked again’. But she said the jury must decide whether it was reasonable to believe Mr Holmes was the aggressor. ‘Here is Mr Holmes, a man who was recently given the all-clear from cancer,’ she said. ‘Does he, as Mr Watts suggests, lose it?’ Watts, of Biggleswade, denies manslaughter, claiming he was acting in self-defence. The trial continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Alan Watts, 65, on trial at Luton for manslaughter of Brian Holmes, 64 .

The evolution of high-quality vision in our distant ancestors could have been driven by a fear of snakes, claim scientists. A new study has supported an older theory that the threat of snakes led to the evolution of primates' forward-facing eyes and enlarged visual centres deep in their brains - and could even apply to humans. The sinuous movement of a snake triggers a primal reaction of panic, even before primates actually realise they have seen the reptile. A new study has supported an older theory that the threat of snakes led to the evolution of primates' forward-facing eyes and enlarged visual centres deep in their brain . The results of a study of the monkey brain suggests primates are uniquely adapted to identity the features of a snake threat and react in a split second. An encounter with a snake very often resulted in death for pre-primates, when reptiles slithered through the forests of Gondwana approximately 100 million years ago to squeeze small ancestors of modern primates to death. In 2006, Lynne Isbell, a behavioral ecologist the University of California, argued that the threat of the reptiles led to the evolution of primates' front-facing eyes and a special area of the brain designed to pick out specific features in the world - including the sinuous movement of a snake, Science Now reported. She showed that primates that have not come across poisonous snakes, such as Lemurs in Madagascar, have less acute vision than other primates that have learned to live with snakes, but there was no neurobiological evidence to support her research. New research describes how images of snakes affect a cluster of neurons in an ancient part of the brain called the thalamus. The cluster of neutrons, called the pulvinar are thought to direct the primates attention using their eyes to rapidly recognise a threat. A scan of a monkey's brain is pictured . However, new research by the University of Toyama in Japan and the University of Brasilia in Brazil, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, describes how images of snakes affect a cluster of neurons in an ancient part of the brain called the thalamus. The cluster of neutrons, called the pulvinar are thought to direct the primates attention using their eyes to rapidly recognise a threat. The research found that primates have larger pulvinars than other animals and part of the cluster is unique to them. In order to come to this conclusion, the scientists inserted electrodes into the brains of two captive macaque monkeys that had never had to contend with snakes and measured the electrical spikes from neurons in two regions of the pulvinar. They did this while the monkeys looked at four types images - one type of which was of snakes that were coiled and stretched out. The scientists inserted electrodes into the brains of two captive macaque monkeys 9similar to the ones pictured) that had never had to contend with snakes and measured the electrical spikes from neurons in two regions of the pulvinar while the creatures looked at images including snakes . The team discovered that the snake pictures had a rapid and strong effect on the pulvinar neurons. The neurons were more active than when the monkey was shown images of faces and shapes and activated 25 milliseconds faster than the shape-detecting neurons. Professor Isbell said the new study is the 'first neuroscientific support' for her theory and believes that the pulvinar neutrons make primates the most effective of any mammals at recognising snakes. Isabelle Blanchette, a cognitive psychologist at the University of Quebec, Trois-RiviÃ¨res, in Canada, warned that the theory might not transfer to humans even if the snake-detecting neurons are a part of our brains, because other processes such as learning and memory probably influence our behaviour just as much as deep instinct. She said: 'Itâ€™s a very important part of the picture, but it is only a part.'","Research by the University of Toyama in Japan and the University of Brasilia in Brazil found snake images affect neurons in an ancient part of the brain .

But Lancashire artist LS Lowry may not have been quite as fond of his roots as previously thought, according to newly-discovered letters. The artist, famous for his 'matchstick men' paintings, privately described his hometown of Manchester as 'a place of the dead', it has emerged. Many of Lowry's drawings and paintings depict Salford. He painted scenes of life in the industrial districts of Northern England . The comment was made in a confidential letter to a friend after Lowry had visited the city, the subject of many of his most famous works. The less than flattering assessment is ironic given the backlash Lowry received from the art world for being 'too Northern'. He is said to have resented the London-centric galleries of his day who adopted a snobbish attitude towards his background. He defiantly produced scores of landscapes depicting northern cities and the people that lived there, often seeking to show the working class way of life. LS Lowry, artist in 1966: New letters suggest that the famous Northern son might not have been quite as proud of his roots as previously thought . More recently, he has been held up as a champion of the North by Tate Modern and other arts organisations. But experts said that his relationship with Manchester and its surrounding towns was much more complex than may people think. Dr Philip Best said: 'Lowry has now become a symbol for people who are keen to promote a new Northern identity. He is a symbol of the vibrancy and cultural wealth of Manchester. 'But that's not quite how he would have seen it in his lifetime. 'When one looks at his paintings, the people are all dressed in the same drab clothing. They're walking around in a daze against an industrial backdrop. 'He is portrayed as a person celebrating the vibrancy of the working class north which is an interesting thing if he described it as a place of the dead. An oil on canvas work by 20th Century British artist Laurence Stephen Lowry . 'When people pass away they often end up being used to promote which ever agenda people seek to push.' The letter is going on sale for the first time after a close friend of the artist put it up for auction. It was written to his art critic friend Mervin Levy on October 19, 1962, from his then home in Mottram-in Longdendale. The note read: 'After about 10 days in London, Manchester seems like a place of the dead - quite deserted in comparison.' Lowry's note to Levy referred to an enclosed a letter also written by the painter to Levy's editor at Studio magazine in which the artist wrote that his friend had 'revitalised' the publication. Lowry's Lancashire Fair Good Friday 1946 . It seems the artist posted both signed letters from Glossop to London in the same envelope. The pair of letters are part of a single lot valued at between £700 and £1,000 by the auctioneers, Fraser's, as part of a wider sale of other non-Lowry artefacts, Autographs, Historical Documents & Memoribilia this Thursday. The current owner obtained the letters from Mr Levy alongside other LS Lowry keepsakes for his private collection.LS Lowery, who died in 1976, was frequently mocked by the London-centric art world because he was a self-taught 'Sunday painter'. The rent collector's roots were firmly based in and around Manchester, having been raised in Salford and attending college in Salford and Manchester before finally earning recognition from the London-based art elite. Earlier this year the capital doffed a belated flat cap to honour Lowry with the first major exhibition to honour the world-renowned artist in 37 years. Tate Britain's Lowry and the Painting of Modern Life exhibition, which came to a close in October, aimed to re-examine the painter 'for a new and extended audience'.","Do uncovered writings reveal artist's 'true feelings' about Manchester?

This is the terrifying moment a UN peacekeeper is gunned down in front of his shocked comrades moments after arriving at the scene of looting in the troubled Central African Republic. The dramatic incident was witnessed first hand by a British Journalist who was driving through the capital Bangui when the truck carrying the peacekeepers swerved in front of his vehicle and pulled up just a few metres away. As soon as the soldiers jump down off the back of the truck the sound of gunfire can be heard and almost instantly one of the men falls in a heap on the ground. Scroll down for video . Man down: UN Peacekeepers go to the aid of a comrade who was shot . moments after arriving at the scene of looting in the troubled Central . African Republic . Some of his comrades take cover while others can be seen cocking their rifles and returning fire. A voice can be heard saying 'they shot their own man’, however it is unclear from the video whether or not the soldier was hit by friendly fire. Witness: British Journalist Alex Thomson, Chief Correspondent for Channel 4, watched the drama unfold . Alex Thomson, Chief Correspondent for Channel 4 News, wrote in his blog: 'As our cameraman Stuart Webb filmed we witnessed them jump out and open fire. 'There is a large volley of shots before anyone appeared to take up firing positions or cover. 'Almost at once one of the soldiers falls, apparently shot, a few metres forward of our position. He lies motionless on the road. Their target appeared to be civilians who had run up a side street from the main airport road. 'I detected no incoming fire and in the chaotic way they opened up it is at least possible he either shot himself or was shot by one of his own men.' The incident happened shortly after it was announced that two French soldiers had been killed fighting in Bangui underscoring the challenges of the French military intervention in the nearly lawless former colony. The government of the predominantly Christian country, was overthrown in March by Muslim rebels from the country's north. While the rebels claimed no religious motive for seizing power, months of resentment and hostility erupted last week in a wave of violence that left more than 400 people dead. France now has some 1,600 troops on the ground in Central African Republic, patrolling neighborhoods and trying to disarm militants from the Seleka rebel movement that forced the president into exile and installed their own leader Michel Djotodia as head of state. The two French troops were part of a team inspecting a neighborhood 1,200 meters east of Bangui's airport close to midnight Monday, in preparation for a disarmament operation, French military spokesman Col. Gilles Jaron said in Paris. The truck carrying the peacekeepers swerves in front of the journalist's car before pulling up on the side of the road . Casualty: Moments after stepping into the street one of the soldiers is shot and falls to the ground . Wounded: As the sound of gunfire subsides, the soldiers move back into the middle of the street to help their fallen comrade . Five to 10 gunmen opened fire on the French patrol, which returned fire, he said. Two Frenchmen were wounded and taken to the hospital where they died. It was unclear whether anyone else died in the clash. Jaron described 'sporadic fire' around Bangui and occasional clashes since the French disarmament efforts got under way Monday. Two deaths within days of the operation beginning marks a significant toll compared to France's mission in Mali earlier this year. The cameraman continues to film through his vehicle's windscreen, as the driver slams into reverse and gets to safety . A total of seven French soldiers have been killed there since January as France and its allies have ousted al-Qaida-linked extremists from power in northern cities. French officials have warned of the dangers of the enhanced military mission alongside African Union troops in Central African Republic, authorized under a muscular mandate approved last week by the United Nations Security Council. France's defense minister has warned militia groups to disarm peacefully - or French troops will do it by force. French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said French forces were conducting patrols by foot and vehicle through the dusty streets of Bangui. At one point, they intervened to pull away a Muslim man, who claimed to be a merchant, from a mob that accused him of being a rebel leader. Intervention: French soldiers are seen on patrol on December in the North of Bangui. Two French soldiers were killed fighting in the city it was announced on Tuesday . Crowds watch as French soldiers arrest ex-seleka rebels after finding weapons in a house in Combattant neighborhood near Bangui's airport . The early casualties underscore the volatility of the mission to disarm combatants and bring stability to a largely anarchic capital. A mob on Monday stoned to death a suspected enemy in the street, and armed fighters have abducted and killed hospital patients. Tensions flared again Tuesday as a mob of young men set fire to a mosque in the Fou neighborhood of the capital, Bangui.

The controversial low-calorie artificial sweetener, aspartame, has been cleared by European food experts as ‘safe for human consumption’. The move has been welcomed by manufacturers, who have been using the sugar alternative in fizzy drinks, such as Diet Coke, and snacks for 30 years. However, one leading British expert has accused the European experts of failing consumers and being biased in favour of the food industry. Sweetner: The move has been welcomed by manufacturers, who have been using the sugar alternative in fizzy drinks, such as Diet Coke, and snacks for 30 years . Aspartame has come under suspicion as a result of research studies drawing links to everything from allergic reactions to cancer and premature births. However, a study by experts on behalf of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), has found it has no harmful effects. EFSA said yesterday: ‘Aspartame and its breakdown products are safe for human consumption at current levels of exposure.’ The chairman of the expert panel which assessed the sweetener, Dr Alicja(correct) Mortensen, said: ‘This opinion represents one of the most comprehensive risk assessments of aspartame ever undertaken. ‘It’s a step forward in strengthening consumer confidence in the scientific underpinning of the EU food safety system and the regulation of food additives.’ Concerns about artificial sweeteners, such as aspartame, have centred on the fact that they contain methanol. Methanol is a nerve toxin, which can be metabolised in the body to form formic acid, which is another nerve toxin, as well as formaldehyde, which is the chemical used to preserve dead bodies. Suspicion: Aspartame has come under suspicion as a result of research studies drawing links to everything from allergic reactions to cancer and premature births . However, the EFSA panel said methanol is also found in other foods such as fruit and vegetables, while the exposure related to consuming aspartame was ‘low’. The findings of EFSA echo the results of a study published by Britain’s Food Standards Agency last week, which found no evidence of harm as a result of human feeding trials. Human guinea pigs were fed cereal snack bars, some of which contained the artificial sweetener, by a team of researchers at Hull York Medical School. The study recruited 50 people who had reported reactions after consuming aspartame in the past, such as headaches and nausea. However, the investigation found no evidence of harm. Erik Millstone, the Professor of Science Policy at the University of Sussex, questioned the validity of the EFSA conclusions. He said the EFSA panel set up to carry out the safety assessment was dominated by experts linked to manufacturers or regulators that have previously supported aspartame. ‘I am very disappointed but not remotely surprised,’ he said. ‘The announcement demonstrates that the EFSA panel on food additives is biased in favour of the chemical and food industries and cannot be relied on to protect or promote consumer interests or public health.’ The professor pointed to several studies that raise questions about the safety of aspartame and justify the need for further research. An EU funded project published in 2010 found pregnant women who down cans of fizzy drink containing artificial sweeteners appear to be at greater risk of having a premature baby. The professor also highlighted work by the independent Ramazzini Foundation in Italy, which has published research suggesting aspartame caused several types of cancer in rats at doses very close to the current acceptable daily intake for humans. The International Sweeteners Association (ISA) welcomed the EFSA opinion and quoted Professor Andrew Renwick, from the University of Southampton, supporting the decision. Prof Renwick reassured consumers, saying: ‘The food industry is a very closely regulated sector. The EFSA Panel on Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food is made up of excellent experts from a wide range of disciplines who have analysed and assessed all available data. ‘People should be confident that the data reviewed is the most up-to-date and that the EFSA opinion is based on all existing scientific facts. Aspartame is a simple compound made from two amino acids and a methyl group, all of which occur naturally in the diet and are consumed in larger amounts from other normal dietary sources.’","European food experts say it is ‘safe for human consumption’

Traditional favourite toy Lego is the top of most children’s Christmas lists in their letters to Santa this year, postal bosses revealed yesterday. Royal Mail analysed over 200,000 letters from UK youngsters to produce a ‘top ten’ based on their wish lists - with surprising results. The age-old favourite - invented in 1949 - beat modern rivals like Peppa Pig and Microsoft’s Xbox One console to take the Christmas crown. Top of the list: The age-old favourite - invented in 1949 - beat modern rivals like Peppa Pig and Microsoft¿s Xbox One console . Demand for the multi-coloured building blocks was so high it even pushed One Direction merchandise into second place among this year’s most wanted.

Surprisingly, the Xbox was the only tech item to make an appearance, with computer tablets, handheld consoles and Sony’s rival Playstation 4 all absent. Dolls also proved a hit for girls with Monster High characters and Sofia Talking Doll taking fifth and sixth place. But some traditional toys did not fare so well - bikes and teddy bears did not feature in the list.

A police officer bled to death after suffering 'torrential bleeding' following the birth of her second child at a struggling hospital, an inquest has heard. Diane Patt, 34, lost five litres of blood and died hours after delivering her daughter because of ‘very serious failings’ at Colchester General Hospital in Essex, a coroner ruled today. The mother-of-two, who died in September 2011 after staff failed to replace the lost fluids, might have survived with 'appropriate and timely treatment', coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray said today. PC Diane Patt, 34, died after suffering 'torrential bleeding' following the birth of her second child in September 2011 . Mrs Beasley-Murray said: 'There were very serious failings in the care Mrs Patt received at Colchester Hospital.' 'Mrs Patt’s death was contributed to by neglect.' The damning verdict also criticised a lack of leadership and failings in staff communication at the hospital, which was in special measures, with Mrs Beasley-Murray criticising ‘an unfortunate degree of chaos and confusion during events’. Mrs Patt's husband, Sergeant Major Jason Patt, of Colchester’s 7th Parachute Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery, told police: 'No one knew what the hell was going on.' Mrs Patt, a police constable based near to her home in Colchester, Essex, had successfully given birth to her baby daughter by ventouse at 8.20pm on 18 September 2011 following a failed forceps delivery. But problems arose soon after as staff noted PC Patt was suffering ‘torrential bleeding’ in the aftermath of the birth. Estimates made at the time placed the bleeding at around 2.4 litres, while the real figure was more than double that, the inquest into Mrs Patt's death heard. Colchester General Hospital: The coroner accused staff there of 'very serious failings' in the care given to Mrs Patt . PC Patt was pronounced dead at 11.57pm with a post-mortem giving the cause of death as a massive haemorrhage which triggered cardiac arrest. The three-day inquest, held at Chelmsford Coroner's Court, heard damning evidence from staff who admitted failing to replace lost blood. Dr Lajos Zsisku, consultant anaesthetist on the night, admitted to the court: 'I would feel much more comfortable if I had given more blood.' Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust released a statement apologising to the family, saying: 'Unfortunately, a massive haemorrhage can occasionally occur during natural childbirth and we deeply regret that Mrs Patt was not given the highest quality of care.' 'My family has been devastated by the errors made by the hospital which has taken a wonderful mother and wife away from us.' - Sgt Major Jason Patt, widower . The statement said a raft of improvements had been implemented at the hospital but added: 'Nothing can now change the tragic events of September 2011.' The damning case comes just months after an inquest into the death of baby Frank Gamble at the same hospital in April 2012 - staff were criticised for using ‘poor technique or excessive force’ with forceps, resulting in a fatal fracture to the child’s skull. After the inquest into Mrs Patt's death, her widower spoke of his 'devastation' at his wife's death. Sgt Major Patt, whose daughter survived the birth, said: 'My family has been devastated by the errors made by the hospital which has taken a wonderful mother and wife away from us. 'I had many unanswered questions before the inquest and I am pleased that the coroner has carried out such a thorough review. 'She identified a succession of very serious failings in Diane's care but my family will now have to deal with the consequences. 'I can only hope that the hospital learns from its mistakes so that the same does not happen to someone else.' Paul Sankey, clinical negligence lawyer with Slater & Gordon, said: 'It is difficult to understand why anaesthetists failed to respond to Mrs Patt's very extensive blood loss and to give her adequate replacement fluids. 'It seems clear that with adequate management she would not have died and proper care would have avoided such a catastrophic loss to her family.'","Diane Patt suffered 'torrential bleeding' after delivering her second child .

Discovery: The boy was found in the ornamental pond in his neighbour's garden (viewed from above) One of the last people to see the toddler . alive described how he was 'happy, energetic and smiling' and playing with the family dog. Family and neighbours paid tribute to the boy and said it was particularly painful that his mother, Amy Dipper, and her partner, had to cope with the tragedy at Christmas time and as they prepared for a new life together. Geoff Jones, 65, said: 'It really chokes you up, the loss of a young child is appalling. 'I saw him just an hour or two before he was reported missing and he was as playful as ever with the family dog in the garden. 'Whenever I saw him with his mum in the street he was a ball of energy . and smiles, it's so tragic. The family were lovely, lovely people. 'They must have only taken their eyes off him for a few seconds, and he's wandered off down the road.' Route: It was believed that Harvey-Lee walked down this path from his family's terraced home to the neighbour's garden . Effort: Neighbours said they thought Harvey-Lee had climbed over this small fence to reach the garden . The youngster was found in a shallow water feature in the property . sitting behind his family's house in Froncysllte, Llangollen, Denbighshire. Neighbours claim he would have had to walk . around 100 metres to reach it. There are two ponds connected by a waterfall - which was turned off at . the time - and can be reached by a narrow walkway just down the road. The boy's parents alerted emergency services as soon as they noticed their son was missing but his body was found in the pond shortly after police officers arrived. His cousin Britt Elvins said the three-year-old had been an inspiration to the family. 'He was born with autism and was such a brave little boy, he was an inspiration to all,' she said. 'My little cousin had a horrible accident and within a split second he was an angel in the sky. 'He was bought up by a wonderful mum who . tried her hardest to give him the normal life they all wanted him to . enjoy along with his big brother.' Emergency: The three-year-old was rushed to Wrexham Maelor Hospital after he was found in the pond close to his home, but died soon after his arrival . Close friend Kate Turner also praised the boy's mother: 'Amy was a fantastic mum and did everything she could for Harvey-Lee. 'She will be torn apart by this - they had just bought a new house and were looking forward to a new life. 'To happen just two weeks before Christmas is a tragedy - the family . would have been preparing to enjoy it with Harvey-Lee and his elder . sister. 'They would have had presents, dinner plans, family plans - it's all ruined now.' Emergency services rushed the child . from the village, which is not far from the border with England, to . Wrexham Maelor Hospital where he was pronounced dead a short time later. 'This is a tragic incident about a . young boy who has died and we are working with the family to support . them,' said a police spokesman. 'Officers continue to investigate the circumstances surrounding his sad passing. 'We . attended an address after receiving a report of a missing child, and a . short time later the child was found close by in a garden pond. 'Despite the efforts of medical staff he sadly passed away.' The boy had gone missing in the Welsh village of Frocysyllte, not far from Wrexham and close to the border with England . His grieving family were today being comforted by a police family liaison officer. A post-mortem examination is expected to take place before a coroner's inquest in Wrexham will be held. A Welsh Ambulance Service spokesperson said: 'Ambulance crews were . called at 12.07pm on Monday to a medical emergency in Froncysyllte, near . Llangollen. 'We sent two emergency ambulances to the scene, supported by an . ambulance officer, and a three-year-old boy was taken to Wrexham Maelor . Hospital. 'He was pronounced dead a short time later.' Wrexham councillor for Llangollen . Rural, Pat Jeffares, who lives in the neighbouring village of Trevor, . returned home from a group meeting at the Guildhall in Wrexham last . night to be made aware of the death. 'I’ve only just heard that a little one was drowned,' he said. 'It’s such a tragedy - so sad.'

Millions of women are being let down by a state pension system that treats them like ‘poor relations’, official figures revealed yesterday. The data from the Office for National Statistics show that 80 per cent of male pensioners get the full amount of £110.15 a week. But just 46 per cent of women receive the full state pension, which is based on National Insurance contributions. Official statistics show just 46% of women receive the full state pension compared to 80% of male pensioners . Many women give up work to look after children and so make lower contributions. Dr Ros Altmann, a pensions expert, said: ‘The state pension system was designed by men for men who had wives at home. ‘Women have been stung by a legacy of rough justice from the pension system. It has discriminated against women for years.’ Overall, a typical retired woman who is receiving her state pension, including additional extras, receives £112 per week. But a man scoops £34 more per week, with an average weekly payout of £146. This is equal to nearly £1,770 more every year. Many women give up work to look after children and therefore make lower contributions . For many women, this is the difference between turning on the heating or staying cold, between visiting relatives or being stuck at home. Malcolm McLean, a consultant from pension advisers Barnett-Waddingham, said: ‘It is clear that women are still very much the poor relations when it comes to the state pension.’ There are far more female than male pensioners in Britain, with around five million men and 7.3million women over State pension age in the UK. To make matters worse, the ONS said one in ten retired women get ‘less than half’ of the basic state pension. The figures follow the revelation yesterday that elderly savers are being stripped of thousands of pounds by middlemen when they retire and turn their pension pots into annuities. Half stay loyal to the insurer they have saved with while  others turn to brokers in search of a better deal. But a report from the Financial Services Consumer Panel found many pensioners were being charged between £1,500 and £3,350 by brokers when moving a pot worth £100,000. The ONS also exposed the  ballooning cost of paying the state pension to Britain’s ageing population. In 2012/13, the state pension and other payouts, such as pension credit, cost the  Government £94billion. This figure is set to explode as people live longer. Two in five baby girls born this year will live to celebrate their 100th birthdays, according to the Department for Work and Pensions. Pensions experts say the state system was 'designed by men for men' and discriminate against women . By 2062/63, the ONS forecasts the bill will have reached £438billion, a sum the Government plans to reduce by raising the state pension age. At present a woman can start claiming state pension at 61 and nine months. A man can start claiming at 65. It will be increased to 65 for women by 2018. The age for both men and women will then rise to 66 by 2020 and 67 by 2028. John Fox, director of the  pension provider Liberty Sipp, said: ‘We all know Britain is facing a pensions timebomb. ‘With these official projections, the ticking just got louder.’","Office for National Statistics show 80% of male pensioners get full amount .

Thousands of pensioners will pay more for fuel this winter after energy giant E.ON scrapped a cheaper tariff for the elderly. The company blamed a Government plan to simplify tariffs for the closure of its Age UK deal which offered a cheaper fuel price to those over 60. It has written to customers to tell them that they have been ‘renewed’ on to its standard fixed rate variable tariff - which costs around £78 more per year. Pensioners hit: Energy giant E.ON has scrapped its Age UK deal which offered a cheaper price fuel to over 60s . It is the second tariff for the elderly that the company has ended after it axed its StayWarm deal two months ago, leaving tens of thousands of customers facing bill increases of as much as £180. E.ON, one of the UK’s biggest suppliers, blamed the Prime Minister’s energy tariff simplification plan for the withdrawal of the tariff. But pressure groups, customers and Ofgem yesterday accused the companies of using the Retail Market Review as an excuse to axe some of the best deals. The plan was announced last year with great fanfare as a way of enabling consumers to better compare energy tariffs. It restricted the number of products . each provider can offer to four for electricity and four for gas. There . were previously a bewildering array of 500 products on offer. Aides . claimed the issue was ‘close to [the Prime Minister’s] heart’ as . figures show that as many as seven in ten households pay over the odds . for power - some by as much as £300 a year. E.ON . customer Stephen Bunney, who was on the Age UK tariff, accused the . company of using the changes as an excuse to put prices up for older . people on cheap deals. The . pensioner was on a standard variable Age UK tariff which he claimed was . better value than everything else on the market when he originally . signed up to it. He . was pleased with the deal and remained on it for roughly five years, . but was contacted on December 6 and told that the tariff was being axed. In the letter to the 65-year-old from Erith, Kent, E.ON wrote: ‘We’re closing your tariff and moving you to E.ON EnergyPlan. It is the second tariff for the elderly that the company has ended after it axed its StayWarm deal two months ago, leaving tens of thousands of customers facing bill increases of as much as £180 . ‘As part of an industry wide programme to create a simpler and clearer, fairer and more competitive energy market, we’ve changed our tariffs and the way we pay you any discounts.’ The letter goes on to estimate that the new tariff will cost Mr Bunney £78 more a year and cancels a three per cent energy discount and UK cold weather payments that he previously received. It also advises him that he can switch to other deals and other suppliers and informed him about a new fixed rate Age UK deal it offers. But Mr Bunney, a retired BT manager, and his wife, who also worked for BT before she retired, said that the new Age UK tariff offered by E.ON was more expensive. ‘Out of the blue they just took me off the deal and put me on a more expensive one. They are using the Government review as an excuse to remove cheap tariffs,’ he said. ‘They’re getting round what’s going to happen by cutting their cheapest tariffs. Their four tariffs won’t be cheaper ones. ‘It’s probably legally ok but it’s not morally ok. They’re screwing the pensioners yet again.’ Jo Ganly, energy expert at uSwitch.com, said: ‘Simplification is a good thing for consumers as the energy market has been notoriously difficult for people to get their heads around. ‘However, it’s important that simplification doesn’t come at a cost. The biggest danger is that consumers start to lose discounts and incentives that are valuable to them. ‘This would be like throwing the baby out with the bath water: penalising the savvy who are already shopping around, while removing any incentive that could encourage non-switchers to join in.’ On average bills will be £60 higher than before this year's round of price hikes even after the government deal to reduce green levies by £50 . An E.ON spokeswoman refused to confirm how many customers were on the Age UK plan for ‘commercial’ reasons. She said: ‘To make the market simpler and easier to compare we now offer four core tariffs as part of the new rules being introduced by Ofgem. ‘We’ve written to customers on historic variable products to advise them that their tariff is no longer available and that we’ll be moving them to our standard offering (as required). ‘We hope to have ‘best deal for you’ conversations with these customers about whether there is a better or more suitable product for their needs and urge customers to get in touch. ‘We will continue to offer Age UK fixed products exclusively for the over 60s.’ Age UK take a commission of around 1.5per cent from the tariffs through their enterprise arm which raises money for the charity. Gordon Morris, Managing Director of Age UK Enterprises, said: ‘While reducing the number of energy tariffs available should help simplify the market following the implementation of the Ofgem Retail Market Review, this customer highlights the important concern that many older people are unaware of the changes taking place and what action they need to take. ‘In the first instance, people should contact their energy supplier to ensure they are on the best tariff - what is important is for all older people to check their energy costs and ensure they are on the best deal for them.’ An Ofgem spokesman said: ‘A key part of our reforms is a restriction on suppliers offering no more than four tariffs for gas and four for electricity. We have never told suppliers which tariffs they have to close to comply with this rule, as that is a decision for them. ‘And in fact we have been clear with all suppliers that they are allowed to keep social tariffs (which for example offer discounts to customers who have difficulty paying bills) under our rules.’","Company scraps Age UK deal which offered a cheaper prices to over 60s .

A surgeon has been suspended after being linked with eight allegedly avoidable deaths. The General Medical Council’s ban on David Berry performing liver surgery follows a review of the cases of 31 of his patients. It found that ten had died and 'eight of those ten deaths were avoidable'. Concerns about the consultant were first raised through normal monitoring procedures. Mr Berry was put on restrictive practice for an internal investigation to be carried out and this led to him being suspended while he was referred to the GMC. A team from the Royal College of Surgeons then held an in-depth investigation which uncovered the eight 'avoidable deaths' linked to his work at University Hospital Wales in Cardiff. The surgeon, who moved there from the Leicester area, had been working for the Cardiff and Vale  University Health Board, which runs the hospital, for 18 months. Yesterday bosses revealed the full extent of their findings as the partner of one of the eight patients began legal action. Martyn Rogers, 66, from Newport, South Wales, died of blood poisoning and acute liver failure last summer. Within three days of undergoing a liver surgery procedure, his organs began shutting down and it was discovered that one of his major veins had been damaged. His death on July 25 last year came one week after Dr Berry carried out an operation to remove tumours from his liver. Maria Davies, his partner of 40 years, has instructed medical law experts at Irwin Mitchell to launch an investigation. She is concerned about the care other patients may have received. Tragedy: University Hospital Wales in Cardiff (pictured) has apologised and opened a helpline for other patients . In a statement, she said: ‘We were led to believe that the surgery would remove the tumours and ultimately prolong his life. ‘To learn that Martyn’s death could have been avoided is very difficult to comprehend and has left me feeling angry. I want to know why his treatment was not better and I am also concerned that other patients may have been affected as the report suggests poor operative skills were partly to blame. Anger: Martyn Rogers, pictured, was one of eight patients who suffered an 'avoidable' death after he developed blood poisoning . 'I would also like to know what steps are being taken by the board within the hospital to ensure no one else suffers the same unnecessary ordeal.’ A spokesman for Cardiff and Vale University Health Board said: 'A liver surgeon working at the University Hospital of Wales was fully suspended from duty in January 2013 following concerns about the outcomes of some liver patients in his care. 'The UHB commissioned a second, detailed review by the Royal College of Surgeons of the individual care of some 31 patients who underwent complex liver surgery by this surgeon, ten of whom sadly died following that surgery. 'The outcome of this detailed review showed that eight of those ten deaths were avoidable.' Medical director Dr Graham Shortland, said the UHB’s normal checks on surgeons’ clinical outcomes had identified the original concerns and no current liver patients were at risk. ‘Every death is a tragedy for the family concerned, but we do not underestimate the impact of a death in these circumstances,’ he added. ‘We would like at the outset to put on record our unreserved apologies to Miss Davies, and every family who has been affected.’ Emma Rush of Irwin Mitchell said: ‘The report into Martyn’s death is deeply concerning and Maria understandably wants answers.’ The UHB has set up a helpline number: 0800 952 0244.","Managers reviewed 31 operations by David Berry after ten patients died .

More than 100 orphaned seal pups have been saved by rescue workers after they were swept away from their mothers during the recent floods. The adorable pups, many of them under three weeks old and in need of constant care, were washed up  after a tidal surge hit the east coast. Each pup is expected to need up to five . months’ rehabilitation after being separated from its mother, and so . many of the animals needed looking after that the East Winch Wildlife Centre in Norfolk has now reached full capacity. Orphaned: This tiny seal pup is one of more than 100 rescued by the RSPCA after they were swept away from their mothers during the recent floods . Alone: The orphaned pups were separated from their mothers in the storm surges that hit the east coast last week . Mission: RSPCA workers help to carry some of the stricken seal pups to safety after they were washed up on the East Anglia shoreline . The centre now needs help from the public to care for the animals, as staff are struggling to cope with the numbers. Centre manager Alison Charles said: 'We have never had a seal rescue project on a scale as big as this before. 'If it wasn’t for us, these seal pups would starve to death. But we really need the public’s help because without their donations we simply couldn’t do what we do. 'This couldn’t have happened at a worse time for the seals. Rescue: The pups were taken from the shoreline by RSPCA workers and taken to an animal rescue centre to be cared for . New home: The animals have been looked after at the East Winch Wildlife Centre in Kings Lynn, Norfolk . Help needed: With the centre at full capacity staff have struggled to cope with the number of seals, prompting the RSPCA to launch a crisis appeal . 'We are at the height of the grey seal . pupping season, which means most of these poor seals should still be . dependent on their mother’s milk.' Seal colonies are a common sight along the Norfolk coast as they come ashore to breed between November and January. There . had been fears that hundreds of seals would be killed when the highest . tides on record hit the coast last Thursday and Friday. Pups cannot swim or survive without their mother’s milk until they have shed their distinctive white fur. At one breeding ground in Horsey, volunteers counted 440 pups on the beach before the surge and only 177 after it hit. In need of TLC: Pups cannot swim or survive without their mother's milk until they have shed their distinctive white fur . Disaster: If it had not been for rescue workers and staff at the centre, the seal pups would have starved to death . Feeding time: It costs £22 a week to feed each of the young seals . But National Trust rangers at . Blakeney Point, one of the largest colonies with about 1,000 seals and . pups, said they had accounted for the vast majority of the seals.' It would appear that the majority of . seals and pups were able to reach higher ground on the sand dunes and . escape the worst of the surge,' a spokesman said. The RSPCA has launched a crisis appeal to help care for the orphaned seals, with the charity saying it costs £22 a week to feed each pup. The eventual aim is to returning the animals to the wild.","East Winch Wildlife Centre has reached ful capacity after so many seal pups swept ashore .

Mr Cameron brushed aside her admission to snorting cocaine and smoking cannabis to hail her as a ‘very funny and warm person’ who creates good recipes. Backing: David Cameron has revealed he is supporting TV cook Nigella Lawson in her public battles . Thanks: Miss Lawson has used the hashtag #Team Nigella to thank her supporters, and offer a recipe for Holiday Hotcake . It seems the Prime Minister is on the right side of public opinion. A YouGov survey at the weekend showed Miss Lawson had actually gained public sympathy since dramatically giving evidence at the trial of her two former assistants accused of fraud. Some 39 per cent of people have more sympathy for Miss Lawson than they did before she gave evidence - compared with just two per cent who have taken her ex-husband's side. The fraud trial at Isleworth Crown Court heard a scathing email from Mr Saatchi which accused Miss Lawson of being 'so off your head on drugs' that she had allowed the PAs to spend 'whatever they liked'. Giving evidence on the witness stand, Miss Lawson admitted to taking drugs in front of her children. The daughter of former Tory chancellor Nigel Lawson began using the hashtag #Team Nigella, to thank her supporters during the divorce and courtroom ordeal. Asked by the Spectator if he was a member of #TeamNigella, Mr Cameron admitted: ‘I am.’ He went on: ‘I’m a massive fan, I’ve had the great pleasure of meeting her a couple of times and she always strikes me as a very funny and warm person. ‘But I’m also an amateur cook and I like her recipes. Nancy [Cameron’s nine-year-old daughter] and I sometimes watch a bit of Nigella on telly. Not in court, I hasten to add.’ Team Nigella: Miss Lawson's team of lawyers, PRs and family who supported her as she gave evidence at Isleworth Crown Court . It is not clear if Mr Cameron has taken Miss Lawson up on her offer on Twitter of the receip for Holiday Hotcake, which she described as 'the perfect receip to show tanks for all your support and to those who hashtag #TeamNigella'. Today the court heard Miss Lawson's personal assistants were able to spend nearly £700,000 on luxuries because their credit card statements were never scrutinised, a court heard today. Italian sisters Elisabetta and Francesca Grillo bought designer items from Chanel and Prada stores during a non-stop shopping trip to New York as they went on a four-year spending spree, the jury was told. Businessman Charles Saatchi who has been locked in a bitter and very public dispute with his ex-wife Miss Lawson . Charles Saatchi's accountant Rahul Gajjar said he did not check the statements for Coutts credit cards given to the pair 'line by line'. The Grillo sisters are accused of committing fraud by abusing their positions by using a company credit card for personal gain. Prosecutors claim the Italian sisters lived the 'high life', spending the money on designer clothes and handbags from Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Vivienne Westwood. The pair, of Bayswater, west London, deny the charge against them. The case continues.

Andy Murray will not be attending the BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards on Sunday despite being hotly tipped to win. The Wimbledon-winner has been training in Miami for three weeks and said the 11-hour flight back to Leeds would be too disruptive to his schedule. Instead the tennis ace, who became the first man to win Wimbledon for 77 years this summer, will appear via satellite but he is keen for his non-attendance to not be seen as a snub. Scroll down for video . Andy Murray is hotly tipped to win Sports Personality of the Year after becoming the first British man to win Wimbledon in 77 years . Sealed with a kiss: Andy Murray kissing the trophy after winning the Wimbledon Championships . Last year: Murray was third in 2012 and was presented on a video link by boxing legend Lennox Lewis . Murray is warming up in Florida following back surgery in September and has only just started playing practice points as he tries to prepare for next month's Australian Open. Speaking the The Guardian, Murray said: 'I have training and rehab every day up until Christmas Day. When I leave for a tournament, I'll be on the road for five months in total – and training on Christmas Day. If Murray wins the award he will not be the first sports star to miss out on collecting it in person. In 2007 boxer Joe Calzaghe had to be handed his award by Lennox Lewis in Las Vegas after travelling to watch friend Ricky Hatton fight Floyd Mayweather. Andrew Flintoff also missed out on collecting his prize in person in 2005 because he was in Pakistan with the England cricket team. 'I won't spend it with my family or girlfriend. I don't want to do it and, likewise, I'd like to be at the awards, but these are the sacrifices I need to make in order to give myself the best chance at the Australian Open in January.' Murray, the world number four, added: 'I have a great relationship with the BBC, from the recent documentary to my regular columns throughout the year and I don't want this to be seen as a snub. 'I'm looking forward to linking up with the show live on the night and being part of it all.' Sources close to Murray described it as . 'genuinely a tough decision for him, as he realises the importance of . the Awards and what a huge 18 months he's had, and what it means to the . British public.' It is believed that Lendl cautioned against the trip as it would disrupt Murray acclimatising to the warmer weather. Murray's friend Ross Hutchins is also training with him, as is outstanding British prospect Kyle Edmund, 18. Murray's . first tournament of the new season will be an exhibition event in Abu . Dhabi on Boxing Day against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, before the official ATP . season opener in Qatar. Murray was also awarded an OBE but almost missed that ceremony too after being randomly selected to complete a drugs test that morning . Murray beat Novak Djokovic at the All England Club this year after losing to Federer the year before . From there it is off to the Australian Open where current champion Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal, who ended last season by regaining the world number one ranking, will be waiting. Murray has always viewed the training camp as an essential part of his training regime, and missed last year's ceremony in order to stay in the US, and was presented with the third place trophy next to the hotel swimming pool. A BBC spokesperson said of Murray's absence: 'We are of course disappointed that Andy Murray cannot be in Leeds in person but are very much looking forward to him joining us live on the night via link-up. 'We're looking forward to a fantastic night celebrating the 60th Sports Personality, with many former winners and some of the world's biggest sport starts attending.'

Maureen Williams has been jailed for 15 months after she stole £170,000 from the account of an elderly dementia sufferer she had befriended . A building society clerk who stole £170,000 from the account of an elderly dementia sufferer she had befriended has been jailed for 15 months. Maureen Williams, 59, took advantage of Betty Holland, 87, when she offered to help her with her finances. She wrote cheques to herself, which she got her confused victim to sign, and handed out the money to her family so they could buy houses. Jailing her for 15 months at Exeter Crown Court, in Devon, Judge Geoffrey Mercer described her crime as a 'gross breach of trust'. He said: 'You had got to know her as a customer at the building society where you worked and you took on the role as her financial adviser and also became a friend. 'At the time of these offences she was clearly, in my view, suffering from dementia or at the very least the onset of dementia. You must have known that from your contact with her. 'In writing out cheques for yourself for her to sign and in making transfers, you took very dishonest advantage of her and it was a gross breach of trust.' The court heard the pair met when Williams was a clerk at a building society branch in Bristol, and were friends for a number of years before she started stealing. Williams, of Winscombe, North Somerset, denied three counts of fraud but was convicted by a jury at Bristol Crown Court on October 17. Sentencing her in Exeter on December 6, Judge Mercer said: 'The money was used in part to buy your son a property and I have set a timetable for confiscation proceedings and expect the money to be repaid. 'I have read a lot of glowing references about you and I have read the medical reports which describe the disease you are suffering from, which carry substantial weight in my sentencing judgment. 'However, this was dishonesty on a scale which must command an immediate prison sentence.' Giles Nelson, mitigating, said Williams is in poor health and her condition means that any jail sentence will be more difficult to cope with than if she had been younger and less frail. Williams first met her victim when she became her financial adviser at the Bradford & Bingley building society branch in Keynsham, near Bristol, 15 years ago. Jailing Maureen Williams for 15 months at Exeter Crown Court (pictured), in Devon, Judge Geoffrey Mercer described her crime as a 'gross breach of trust' Williams later left to become a freelance Independent Financial Adviser and Ms Holland, who lived in Farmborough near Bath, became her client. Prosecutors claimed Williams spent eight years grooming the widow into entrusting her with all her financial affairs. And when Ms Holland - who had no children - developed dementia Williams saw her chance to cash in. 'You should never take advantage of vulnerable people like this. But she just got greedy' - Betty Holland's cousin Rachel Smith . She wrote out a number of large cheques, including one for £75,000, which confused Ms Holland would sign at her request without knowing what they were for. The fraud was only uncovered when Ms Holland collapsed at home in November 2009 and was taken into hospital. Her relatives became concerned about her finances and began to investigate and Williams was arrested in 2010. Ms Holland's cousin Rachel Smith, 45, of Melksham, Wiltshire, said: 'By the end Betty didn't know what she was doing because of her dementia. 'She (Williams) would put cheques in front of her and she would sign them. Betty trusted her completely - after all, who wouldn't trust a financial advisor? 'You should never take advantage of vulnerable people like this. But she just got greedy.' Williams was arrested in 2010 and denied any offences. She said the money was a gift and had no reason to disclose it to the Holland family. After sentencing, Detective Constable Sandy Osborne, who led the investigation, said: 'This kind of dishonesty offence is rarely brought to the notice of the police and I am delighted that justice was done in this case. 'Judge Mercer's sentence should act as a warning to others who abuse their position of trust to prey on vulnerable members of society.' Legal action is now underway under the Proceeds of Crime Act to recover the money Williams unlawfully obtained. Ms Holland, who ran a garage with her late husband, now lives in a nursing home in Trowbridge, Wiltshire, and has severe dementia.","Maureen Williams took advantage of Betty Holland who she offered to help .

Walks free: Fireworks display organiser Geoffrey Counsell leaves Bristol Crown Court yesterday as he was cleared of causing the deaths of seven and injuring 51 on the M5 . A fireworks organiser accused of causing a motorway crash that killed seven and injured 51 says the authorities wanted 'someone to blame' as he was cleared of breaching health and safety law yesterday. A judge directed a jury at Bristol Crown Court to find Geoffrey Counsell, 51, not guilty of a single charge of failing to ensure the safety of others contrary to the Health and Safety at Work Act. Seven people died in a massive motorway pile-up involving more than 30 cars when they were engulfed by a thick fog on the M5 near Taunton at around 8.20pm on November 4 2011. The smog was so thick that motorists on . the northbound carriageway likened it to having a tin of paint thrown . over their windscreens. Geoffrey Counsell, 51, said he . believed the decision to prosecute him was 'motivated by a desire to . find someone to blame for this terrible accident, simply for the sake of . doing so'. Speaking outside . Bristol Crown Court, he said: 'I would like to start by expressing my . sympathy to all those who were affected by the terrible crash on . November 4 2011. 'I have . been through an appalling experience over the last two years, yet I . recognise that my misfortune is as nothing compared with that of those . bereaved and injured as a result of that accident. Judge Justice Simon, who directed the jury at Bristol Crown Court to return a verdict of not guilty, said: 'The prosecution case required Mr Counsell to appreciate and react more or less instantly to something not thought to be a hazard to anyone and had no previous reason to think it was a hazard.' He added: 'There was no proper basis that you could have concluded that a reasonable person would have appreciated a reasonable risk and reacted to it to stop the display.' Mr Counsell was in charge of the massive event at a rugby club which saw 1,500 rockets fired during a 15 minute display. Through his solicitor, Gavin Reese, Mr Counsell said outside court: 'Before . a final decision to go ahead with the display was taken, the Highways . Agency, the Taunton Deane Borough Council and the Avon and Somerset . Constabulary were consulted. 'All were informed of the fact and . nature of the display. No objection of any kind was raised. As matters . transpired, the Taunton Deane Borough Council and Avon and Somerset . Constabulary were to be the agencies which prosecuted me in respect of . that same display. 'The display was carried out without incident. It . was a very foggy night and the fireworks produced some smoke, which . would have mingled with the fog. 'However, I saw nothing to cause me to believe that any firework smoke would cause a hazard and I do not believe that it did so'. Mr Counsell continued: 'The prosecution case against me was based on the suggestion that I should have recognised the risk of something occurring which has never been shown to have happened before, which probably did not happen, and risk of which was not recognised by anyone else. 'The judge noted when he ruled that there was no case to answer, the prosecution case was 'heavily weighted with hindsight"". Message: Fireworks contractor Geoffrey Counsell, 51, (right) with a member of his legal team, Gavin Reese (centre), who said the authorities who agreed to the display then sought to blame his client . Tragedy: The M5 in Somerset on November 5 2011, the day after the fireworks display designed by Geoffrey Counsell, who was cleared of any wrongdoing yesterday . 'As many people will be aware, the assistant chief constable of Avon and Somerset Constabulary Mr (Anthony) Bangham appeared on national television less than 48 hours after the crash to advance the police belief that smoke from the display had caused the crash. Carnage: The horrifying result of the M5 crash, which happened in conditions drivers described as like having paint on their windscreens . 'Hours before the pronouncement was made, officers from Avon and Somerset Constabulary had unlawfully obtained a warrant to search my home, as the judge found during the trial. 'The unlawful search of my home took place despite the fact that I had previously expressly confirmed to the police my willingness to co-operate with their inquiry in any way. 'The current proceedings were brought jointly by the Avon and Somerset Constabulary and Taunton Deane Borough Council. Prior to the proceedings being brought, those representing me wrote to Taunton Deane Borough Council highlighting the obvious flaws in the case. 'Those concerns were simply ignored. Again, in August of this year, those representing me set out in court documents the very issues which caused the case to come to a halt. Nevertheless, the prosecution continued. 'I am obviously extremely relieved that I have been cleared of any blame for this terrible crash. So, whilst I am very relieved that, more than two years later, my ordeal is over, I continue to feel that my prosecution was motivated by a desire to find someone to blame for this terrible accident, simply for the sake of doing so.' It was alleged that Mr Counsell, . of Ashill in Somerset, failed to ensure he operated the firework display . so as to ensure, as far as was reasonably practicable, that others who . might be affected were not exposed to risks to their health and safety. Mr Counsell was originally charged with . seven counts of manslaughter but they were dropped earlier this year and . instead he faced the health and safety charge. Grandparents Anthony and Pamela Adams, from Newport, South Wales; father and daughter Michael and Maggie Barton, from Windsor, Berkshire; battle re-enactor Malcolm Beacham, from Woolavington, Somerset; and lorry drivers Terry Brice, from South Gloucestershire, and Kye Thomas, from Cornwall, died and 51 people were injured, including some seriously, in the pile-up. Mr Counsell, who ran Firestorm Pyrotechnics, was the contractor hired by Taunton Rugby Club to run the £3,000 display at its ground, which was watched by 1,000 people. He set off 1,500 shots as part of his Jupiter Display in 15 minutes - just 200 yards from the motorway. In a leaflet promoting his business, the experienced Mr Counsell described the display as the 'biggest and most lavish' piece of 'unforgettable' pyrotechnics he offered. Much loved: Anthony and Pamela Adams who were amongst those killed in fatal crash on the M5 near Taunton, Somerset, in November 2011 . Victims: Malcolm Beacham (top left), Bristol . lorry driver Terry Brice (top right),  former soldier and lorry driver . Kye Thomas (bottom left) and Maggie Barton (bottom right), all killed . in the crash on the M5 near Taunton . Witnesses described seeing the smoke drift across the nearby carriageway. Peter Blair QC, prosecuting, . told the jury: 'Essentially the prosecution say they experienced a loss . of visibility, generated, we say, by a plume of smoke created by Mr . Counsell from his firework display which had built up. Bereft: Elaine Adams, whose family members died in the accident on the M5, and spoke on behalf of all victims, said that she was 'devastated' by what had happened . 'It was dispersed because of the lack of wind mixed with the humid air and drifted in the direction of the motorway. 'We . say people were exposed to an appreciable risk to their personal safety . that night as a consequence of the way Mr Counsell prepared for and . then went about his business. 'We . say that ensuring the safety of people using that motorway needed . particular care if you were going to undertake a big firework display . involving the use of a substantial volume of these hazardous explosives, . which generated a lot of smoke. 'Smoke . can have an appreciable effect on reducing visibility - that should be . obvious. It didn't take long from the build-up of smoke to the dramatic . loss of visibility. 'We say . if he had adequately undertaken his health and safety properly, some or . all of the consequences which unfolded on November 4 may have been . avoided.' Elaine Adams, from Barry, South Wales, and daughter of Mr and Mrs Adams, said: 'I am speaking on behalf of all the families here and we are all absolutely devastated. 'We feel that things should have gone a little bit further and the judge should have made more of an informed decision. 'I am really upset. I am very, very cross about what happened. 'I am just devastated and I am really upset and, to be honest, as much as there has been a picture brought up over the last few weeks, there is still a lot of confusion. 'I think a lot of money has been wasted and I think there are things that could have been done that haven't been done. 'I would have liked to have seen the defence witnesses before the case was stopped.' Pile-up: The emergency services consider the situation on the night that seven died and 51 were injured on the M5 in 2011 . Aftermath: View of the wreckage which shows burnt out cars along the M5 where seven people died . Bristol Crown Court heard that the smog built up during and after a fireworks display at Taunton Rugby Club and drifted across the road . Pile-up: One driver said her car hit a patch of white mist as it entered the M5 at junction 25 . Ms Adams said she still believed it was right to bring the prosecution. 'I . think perhaps health and safety are at fault for their guidance. Despite having evidence, their guidance is not clear,' she said. John . Williams, leader of Taunton Deane Borough Council, said: 'I hope that . the end of Crown Court proceedings brings some closure for the families, . friends and colleagues of those who lost their lives or suffered injury . in the terrible events on November 4 2011. 'The . council is now seeking to work closely with the relevant authorities to . see if the current guidance regarding large fireworks displays, such as . the one at Taunton Rugby Club, is appropriate. 'We . also pledge our support for any changes that may be deemed necessary. Our primary concern is to minimise the risks of this type of . unimaginable incident happening again. 'On . behalf of the council, I would like to extend my deepest sympathy to . the families of the bereaved and the families and friends of all those . affected by these terrible events.

Children as young as four see 70 adverts for payday loans on television each year. In total, adverts from firms offering high interest, short-term credit were watched almost 600million times by children last year, figures suggest. It comes after a 23-fold rise in the number of such commercials in only three years, with 397,000 aired in 2012 – more than half during the day. TV watchdog Ofcom revealed how the number of adverts has soared from just 17,000 in 2008 to 400,000 last year, which would take 138 days  to watch back-to-back around the clock. Adverts for the likes of WOnga (left) and Payday UK have been criticised for normalising high interest loans . The number of payday loan adverts hit almost 400,000 last year, up from just 17,000 in 2008 . Payday loan firms are accused of particularly targeting using daytime TV to persuade the unemployed and those raising children to take out loans charging more than 5,000 per cent APR interest. Charities and unions called for a crackdown on the adverts which 'prey' on the vulnerable and influence even very young children. Labour leader Ed Miliband has called for the adverts to be banned from children’s TV altogether, after accusing the firms of creating a ‘quiet crisis’ for thousands of families swamped by debt. And money expert Martin Lewis condemned . adverts during children’s TV as ‘inappropriate propaganda’ which means . even the under-10s now nag their parents to borrow money to buy toys. In 2009 there were just 17,000 payday loan adverts shown on UK television, recording 12million views or ‘impacts’ among adults and 3million 4-15-year-olds. WONGA Typical APR 5853% . Signed a four-year deal to sponsor Newcastle United. This . month hired a Bafta-nominated director to produce a film on the . controversial company to counteract criticism about its huge profits and . sky-high interest rates. CASH LADY Typical APR 2670% . Courted controversy when it hired ex-bankrupt reality star Kerry Katona to front ad campaign.  But this summer the Atomic Kitten star declared herself bankrupt for the second time in five years due to unpaid debts. Her money troubles led to her being dropped as the face of Cash Lady. PAYDAY UK Typical APR 2610% . Bought by US giant Dollar Financial in 2011 for a reported $195million. It is now part of the same firm which owns The Money Shop, which has 550 stores nationwide. QUICK QUID Typical APR 1734% . Spent an estimated £3.2 million, advertising during programmes like Friends, Desperate Scousewives and Hollyoaks. In July it apologised after sending emails threatening to send in debt collectors to people who had not borrowed money. By last year the number of adverts had rocketed to 397,000, with 7.5billion impacts among adults and 596million for children. It means that last year every adult saw 152 payday loan adverts, and 4-15-year-olds watched the equivalent of 70 each. A survey on MoneySavingExpert.com found a . third of parents reported their under-10s repeating payday lenders’ slogans, while 14 per cent said that when they had refused to buy a toy, . their child had nagged them to take out a payday loan. Martin Lewis, creator of MoneySavingExpert.com said: 'The Ofcom research is proof that payday lenders are grooming our children to be the next generation of borrowers, either deliberately, or due to lack of care when placing adverts. 'Our research shows 14 per cent of parents of under-10s have had their kids suggest a payday loan when they’ve been turned down for things like toys. 'But the real danger is the normalisation of these far-from normal loans to the next generation. 'We called six weeks ago for the Government to ban all high-cost credit advertising from kids’  TV. 'The Labour Party has picked it up and now supports the policy.  Today’s research should act as a clarion call for others to follow. 'Mr Cameron, Mr Clegg – please, its time you too supported this and made it happen.' Ofcom published audience research into advertising of ‘payday’ loans on TV. Payday loans accounted for just 0.1 per cent of all advertising spots, but that figure has risen sharply to 1.2 per cent. More than half of payday loan adverts were shown during daytime TV from 9:30am to 4:59pm. A . further 16 per cent were shown between 5pm and 8:59pm and 15 per cent . between 11pm and 5:59am, 9 per cent between 6am and 9:29am and the . remaining 6 per cent between 9:00pm and 10:59pm. Around 1 per cent of all the adverts were show on children's TV channels. Citizens Advice Chief Executive Gillian Guy said:'Payday lenders are unashamedly and irresponsibly using adverts to prey on poorer households in a bid to capitalise on the cost of living crisis. 'Payday lenders should not be targeting children and teenagers with adverts. 'It is deeply concerning that children and teenagers were exposed to three times as many payday loan ads in 2012 compared to in 2010. 'More and more adverts are appearing on music channels and TV stations popular with teenagers and young people as lenders try to entice the next generation of borrowers. 'Lenders’ targeting of young people and those on low incomes is coupled with industry failures to make sure loans are only given to people who can afford to repay.  Citizens Advice has found 61 per cent of loans do not come with proper checks to ensure the borrower can pay back the loan.' One in four payday loan adverts is shown on a music channel and 8 per cent appear on movie channels. The vast bulk - 42 per cent - are shown on the main terrestrial channels. Mr . Miliband last month called for the ads to banned during any programmes . aimed at children. He said: 'As a father of two young boys, I know how . influenced they can be by what they see. 'And I don't want payday lenders taking advantage of the cost of living crisis and targeting children in this country. 'It . is wrong, it is not what should be happening and that is why a Labour . government would stop them advertising during children's TV. 'It's bad for young people, it's bad for families and it's bad for communities.' More than half of all payday loan adverts are seen during daytime TV . The union Unite called for a 9pm watershed for payday loans adverts. Unite assistant general secretary Steve Turner said: 'This research paints a horrific picture of a generation of children and young people being groomed into a culture of debt by this bombardment of advertising. 'It is not just children being infected by this payday loan culture. Research has shown that people are borrowing £660 a month just to pay for the necessities of life - food, housing and heating. 'The ASA should give a robust lead in introducing a 9pm watershed for these payday loans so that children are not influenced by this insidious onslaught. 'The number of adverts should be curbed as the public are being duped into thinking that getting into debt is an easy option and pain free - quite the contrary.'","Ofcom reveals number of ads soared from 17,000 in 2008 to 400,000 in 2012 .

The Serious Fraud Office faced further embarrassment after it was forced to drop a high-profile case estimated to have cost the taxpayer £1.4 million. Victor Dahdaleh, 70, a friend of Tony Blair, was accused of paying £39 million to the Bahraini royal family to secure multi-billion pound aluminium contracts. Dahdaleh was said to have handed around £3 million in kickbacks to Bruce Hall, 61, the chief executive officer of smelting firm Alba, who spent some of his cash gains on luxury property, Southwark Crown Court heard. Hall already admitted conspiracy to corrupt and gave evidence against Dahdaleh. But his testimony was so different from his statements to the SFO that the agency had to throw in the towel seven weeks into the case. Two witnesses from the US were also unwilling to attend the trial. In a statement the agency said: ‘The SFO has today offered no evidence against Victor Dahdaleh, having concluded that there is no longer a realistic prospect of conviction in this case. ‘The SFO had previously obtained the conviction of a conspirator, Bruce Hall, who pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to corrupt. 'Mr Dahdaleh was the only remaining defendant in the case.’ Dahdaleh a Jordanian-born metals magnate . allegedly issued orders for the payments, totaling more than £40million, . to be made using a fax machine at his home in Belgravia, central .

Dahdaleh was said to have been a major donor to the Labour Party, which is now disputed by officials. He was once introduced by Lord Mandelson as ‘Victor, my friend’, and had a ‘warm relationship’ with Mr Blair while he was prime minister. He insisted he had done nothing improper. Dahdaleh, of Eaton Place, Belgravia, central London, denied conspiracy to corrupt, six counts of corruption and a further count of transferring criminal property. A series of cases brought by the SFO have collapsed in recent years including the prosecution of property magnates Robert and Vincent Tchenguiz.

There are several ways to survive an avalanche - hold onto something and pray, 'swim' in the direction of the snow... or be a mountain goat. That certainly helped these light-footed animals after they were faced with a wall of snow hurtling down a mountainside in the French Alps last week.

As five of the chamois goats hot-hoof it over the cascading snow to safety, the remaining four disappear under a white sheet, much to the dismay of the helicopter crew which recorded the footage . It's not looking good for the goat quartet... Five make a dash for it while the others try to sit it out. As the 'runners' nimbly hot-hoof it over the cascading snow to safety, the hapless four disappear under a white sheet, much to the dismay of the helicopter crew. Their commentary is in French, but the sheer emotion in the voices as they cry 'Ay, ay, ay!' dispenses with the need for Google Translate. And just when all seems lost, two, three, then all four buried goats emerge and rush off to join the rest of the group. Battered, possibly; bruised, maybe. But alive. In October, two climbers in the region suffered mild injuries while climbing the glacier du Génépy. They were just below the summit ridge at 3,500 meters when they triggered a slab of snow. But what's this? Two of the animals emerge from under the wall of snow! Four! Amazingly, the 'Lazarus' goats live again and race to re-join the herd .

Giant steps taken by the biggest dinosaur that ever strode the Earth have been reconstructed by scientists. Argentinosaurus, from South America, was able to walk for the first time in more than 94 million years - virtually, on a computer screen. Its movements were modelled by experts from the University of Manchester who laser scanned a 40 metre-long skeleton of the 80 tonne beast housed in an Argentine museum. A reconstructed skeleton of the giant dinosaur Argentinosaurus at the Carmen Funes museum in Plaza Huincul, Argentina. Scientists from the University of Manchester have reconstructed the giant dinosaur's steps to show how it walked . Argentinosaurus is a type of titanosaur sauropod -  part of a family of incredibly large dinosaurs. It was first discovered in Argentina, hence its name. The dinosaur lived on the then-island continent of South America somewhere between 97 and 94 million years ago, during the Late Cretaceous Epoch. It is among the largest known dinosaurs. An early reconstruction estimated Argentinosaurus at between 30â€“40 metres (98â€“115 ft) in length with a weight of up to 80â€“100 tonnes. The simulation used artificially intelligent software and processing power the equivalent of 30,000 desktop computers. Lead scientist Dr Bill Sellers, from the university's Faculty of Life Sciences, said: 'If you want to work out how dinosaurs walked, the best approach is computer simulation. 'This is the only way of bringing together all the different strands of information we have on this dinosaur, so we can reconstruct how it once moved.' The simulated footprints of the 40-metre Cretaceous Argentinosaurus dinosaur skeleton . Some sceptics have doubted that such a heavy animal could have walked and suggested that estimates of its weight must be inflated. Dr Lee Margetts, another member of the Manchester team, said: 'The new study clearly demonstrates the dinosaur was more than capable of strolling across the Cretaceous planes of what is now Patagonia, South America.' Co-author, Dr Phil Manning, also from the university, said: 'The digitisation of such vast dinosaur skeletons using laser scanners brings Walking with Dinosaurs to life - this is science, not just animation.' The scientists' study was published in journal Public Library of Science ONE. Argentinosaurus was a plant-eater that stood as tall as a three-storey building and stretched to 38 metres (125 feet) in length. When it was alive, the Andes mountains were mere hillocks and arid North Patagonia consisted of steamy jungle and grassland. Dr Sellers said: 'The important thing is that these animals are not like any animal alive today and so we can't just copy a modern animal. Dr Bill Sellers, from the University of Manchester said that computer simulation is the best way of working out how dinosaurs walked and a way of collecting different strands of information together. A computer simulation of the dinosaur's joints is pictured . 'Our machine learning system works purely . from the information we have on the dinosaur and predicts the best . possible movement patterns.' 'Agentinosaurus is the biggest animal that ever walked on the surface of the earth and understanding how it did this will tell us a lot about the maximum performance of the vertebrate musculoskeletal system. We need to know more about this to help understand how it functions in ourselves. 'Similarly if we want to build better legged robots then we need to know more about the mechanics of legs in a whole range of animals and nothing has bigger, more powerful legs than Argentinosaurus.'","Experts from the University of Manchester digitally reconstructed the steps taken by a huge dinosaur called Argentinosaurus .

Missing: Botanist Jamie Taggart, 41, from Argyll and Bute . in Scotland, has been missing for more than five weeks in the mountains . of north Vietnam . Searches are under way for a British botanist who has been missing in the moutains of north Vietnam for more than five weeks. Jamie Taggart, from Argyll and Bute in Scotland, was last seen heading off from the frontier town of Sapa on a plant-hunting trip in the wilderness earlier this month. Inquiries by his family have revealed that alarm was raised about the 41-year-old's whereabouts on November 2, when his rucksack and passport were found at a guest house. Sapa is the capital of Sa Pa District in Lào Cai Province in northwest Vietnam, near the border with China. The Hoàng Liên Son range of mountains dominates the district, which is at the eastern extremity of the Himalayas. Local police and the British embassy in Hanoi, 240 miles south of Sapa, were informed of his disappearance, but searches have so far been fruitless. Mr Taggart runs Linn Botanic Gardens in the village of Cove on the Rosneath peninsula. He also serves his community as a retained firefighter. His father, Jim Taggart, found out his son was missing when he failed to appear on a scheduled flight home to Scotland on November 29. Dr Taggart said: 'He is being searched for, so far without result of any kind. I only heard about it when he did not come home on the flight he was booked on. 'Something has happened to him, but not necessarily an accident on a hill.' The botanist, who is a keen runner, arrived at a guest house in Sapa on October 30 and left on a motorbike taxi to explore the hills. On November 2 his rucksack and passport were found at the accommodation. Dr Taggart told BBC Radio Scotland that he had very limited knowledge about the situation. After arriving, Mr Taggart sent a handful of text messages to his father before the contact stopped. Dr Taggart said: 'The last text message said exactly where he was going. He discussed it with me before. I assumed his mobile phone had failed.' Dr Taggart said his son was on his own on the trip but had been to that area two years ago and knew his way around. He said there had already been two days of dedicated searching in the area near Sapa. 'I don't think he had got lost. Either something happened to him on his first day on the hills or there is some explanation we can only guess at,' he told the Good Morning Scotland programme. 'He was found to be missing because he'd left his rucksack in the guesthouse he was staying in. 'The guesthouse, when he didn't come back, phoned the local police. They had a look and didn't see him. 'He had left his passport behind. I understand that when travelling in Vietnam you have to have identity. 'He might have deliberately left it, knowing my son, in case he lost it on the hill. 'He is now actively being looked for.' Police and the British embassy in Hanoi . were informed of Mr Taggart's disappearance, but searches have so far . been fruitless. His family only realised he was missing after he failed . to turn up on his scheduled flight home . The missing man's father said the Foreign Office is 'on the case' while various people including Lord McFall and Argyll and Bute Lib Dem MP Alan Reid were also said to be in touch with the authorities. Mr Taggart was last seen heading off from the frontier town of Sapa on a plant-hunting trip in the wilderness. His possessions were left in a hotel . Prayers have been said for Mr Taggart at Craigrownie Church. He took over responsibility for Linn Botanic Gardens from his father in 1997. In March this year the attraction was added to Historic Scotland's Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes. A Scottish Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said many people desperately want to see Mr Taggart return home safely. Area commander Paul Connelly, the senior officer for Argyll and Bute, said: 'This is obviously an extremely difficult time for Jamie's family and friends and we can only hope there will be a positive outcome. 'Jamie has served his community as a dedicated and professional firefighter and is a popular member of a very close-knit and highly experienced team at Cove. 'There are a great many people who desperately want to see him return home safe.' A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said: 'We are aware that a British national was reported missing on October 31 whilst in the Sapa Mountain area, Vietnam.' 'We are in close contact with the local authorities and are providing consular assistance to their family at this difficult time.'","Jamie Taggart last seen heading off on plant-hunting trip in the wilderness .

He was found the next day at his girlfriend's house having run home and used a hacksaw to remove his handcuffs. Appearing at Burnely Crown Court yesterday, he admitted conspiracy to supply cocaine and escape and was jailed for three years yesterday. Officers were called to reports of a man loitering outside a car near Burnley Town Hall on June 26. When they arrived they found Khan sitting on a bench and a man in the vehicle with £360 of cocaine, divided into £20 'wraps' for sale.

An Olympic medallist has been arrested as part of a 'child kidnap gang' that plotted to steal children involved in custody battles. Ukrainian Olympic sailing champion Larysa Moskalenko was held by police in Italy. Officers say they have broken up an international child abduction ring that charged thousands of pounds to steal children. Scroll down for video . Ukrainian sailing champion Moskalenko was arrested as police broke up a 'child kidnap ring' Moskalenko: The Olympic champion was arrested in connection with the organisation . The Telegraph reports several people have been arrested as well as Moskalenko and they have been named as Luigi Cannistraro, Antonio Barazza and Sebastiano Calabrese. The four were allegedly involved in a company which involved former special forces soldiers. Armed with weapons, tasers and pepper spray, it is alleged they launched risky operations to take the children. Children who were living with one parent following a divorce or separation were reunited with the other parent. Police said the organisation employed 'contractors, for the most part veterans of special corps from the armed forces, ready to offer their operational skills to whoever was willing to pay them handsomely enough'. Bronze medallist Moskalenko scooped her award at the Seoul Olympics but in 1993 moved to Sicily, where she now runs a luxury boat rental business. It is alleged her part in the syndicate was to hire out powerful speed boats which were used to take children from countries in North Africa and bring them to Italy, from where they were reunited with their parents in other European countries. Moskalenko, 50, was arrested on Thursday by police in Palermo, Sicily, along with two boat captains, Barazza and Calabrese and another local man, Cannistraro. Arrest warrants were also issued for Per Ake Helgesson, reportedly a former member of the French Foreign Legion, and Daniel Bakke, two Swedish employees of ABP World Group, a Norwegian security company with offices in Britain. The pair have been in Tunisia for more than a year after being arrested in November last year in connection with a plot to help a Norwegian woman abduct her daughter from her estranged Tunisian husband. The firm charged up to €250,000 (£212,000) for operations, the Italian police said. Seven people are believed to have been arrested, including Larisa Moskalenko, pictured left . An arrest warrant was also issued for Martin Waage, the chief executive officer of the security firm, which specialises in what it calls 'parental child abduction cases'. Its website says: 'ABP World Group is dedicated to assisting those parents who need help in locating, rescuing and returning their abducted children home safely. We offer worldwide services regarding parental abduction,' Mr Waage denied that any of his employees had done anything wrong, insisting that they never carried weapons and operated within the law. The firm provided 'security and surveillance' for parents attempting to snatch back children from estranged partners, he told The Telegraph. The alleged plot involved kidnapping children from North African countries and taking them via Sicily to the rest of Europe. One child was allegedly taken to Norway in October last year . The company had worked for clients all over the world, including on behalf of Britons locked in custody disputes with ex-wives and husbands in Africa and Asia. 'We are not a criminal organisation involved in kidnapping or trafficking,' he said. 'We are a serious company working on child recovery, operating on the right side of the law. We never use weapons – that would mean the situation was already too dangerous for the child involved. We have friends in Interpol and we cooperate with the police.' He admitted that the firm had hired Moskalenko to provide a speedboat, which was kept on standby off the coast of Tunisia to act as back-up for the operation in Tunis. 'We never go into a country like Tunisia without having a back door (exit strategy),' Mr Waage, 42, a former paramedic and close protection officer, said. 'She is innocent - she just hired us a boat.' But police in Italy say he and the other accused could face charges of kidnapping and human trafficking.

Argentine scientists have found a way to transform the gas created by cows' digestive systems into fuel. They claim the innovation that could curb greenhouse gases that are believed to cause global warming. Methane is separated from the smelly cow gas, which can be used to fuel cars as well as other machines. Argentine scientists have found a way to transform the gas created by the bovine digestive system into fuel -  an innovation that could curb greenhouse gases that cause global warming . Argentina's National Institute of Agricultural Technology (INTA) came up with the idea of using a system of valves and pumps to collect and process the gas. The experimental technique channels the digestive gases from bovine stomach cavities through a tube and into a tank. The gases - which otherwise are commonly known as burps, or 'eruptos' in Spanish - are then processed to separate methane from other gases such as carbon dioxide. Methane is the main component of natural gas, used to fuel everything from cars to power plants. 'Once you get it compressed, it's the same as having natural gas,' said Guillermo Berra, head of INTA's animal physiology group. The cow gas is processed to separate methane from other gases. Methane is the main component of natural gas, used to fuel everything from cars to power plants. Pictured is a concept car from the year 2000, made by Jeep, which uses methane and fuel cell technology to power the vehicle . 'As an energy source it is not very practical at the moment, but if you look ahead to 2050, when fossil fuel reserves are going to be in trouble, it is an alternative,' he told Reuters. Each herd of cattle emits between 250 and 300 litres of pure methane a day, which is enough energy to keep a refrigerator running for 24 hours. Argentina is one of the world's top beef exporters, with around 51 million herds of cattle. Gases emitted from those animals account for 30 per cent of the country's total greenhouse gas emissions, according to INTA, with methane having 23 times the global warming effect as carbon dioxide. 'This is also a way to mitigate that,' Berra said. A man herds dairy cows in the city of Totoras, 224 miles north of Buenos Aires.

A boy who developed anorexia after being bullied as a teenager has overcome his eating disorder to become a personal trainer and model. At his lowest weight last year, Carl Creasey, 22, from Rainham, Essex, weighed just 5st 5Ib. He would closely monitor what he ate, measuring out tiny portions, and then exercise as much as he could to burn off calories. He would also avoid mealtimes in an attempt to conceal his problem from family and friends. Buffed up:  Carl once weighed 5st 5lb, left,  but now he has a six pack after beating anorexia . He said: 'I use to do whatever I could to avoid food and sometimes avoided coming home just not to eat. I was addicted to the scales and if I wasn't losing weight I would increase my exercise. Sometimes I would go through the day with just a banana and cereal bar. 'I was obsessed with weight and measuring my food. I would eat the same things everyday as my body felt comfortable consuming these foods.' Carl explained how his anorexia started after he was bullied at school and he 'saw food as the . only thing that I could control.' Transformation: He was once bullied at school and skipped meals to gain some control over his life but now has the confidence to model . In October 2012, he spent a month in a rehabilitation centre for people with eating disorders after doctors were concerned at how skinny he had become and feared his could only have months to live. The stay helped him change his attitudes towards food and set him on the road to recovery. He then became interested in bodybuilding after seeing how a friend had transformed their physique after taking up the sport. He realised if he wanted to get a buff body, he would have to eat more - to give his body fuel to work out and protein to build muscle and aid his recovery from exercise. He said: 'I knew things had to change and I . had always admired the bodybuilding physique. I knew if I was to get . that kind of body then I would need to eat and supplement properly so I . started going to the gym. I took it easy at first and built my way up . learning and taking advice from friends and other gym goers.

Carl's self-esteem grew as well as his muscle tone and he decided to make a career out of his new hobby by qualifying to be a personal trainer. He loves being able to help other people get the physiques they want through a balanced diet and sensible exercise. He said: 'I now help and encourage others to beat their eating disorder as skipping meals is not the way forward.'

Alastair Campbell, former Labour spin doctor and Tony Blair's one time 'right hand man', is to make a return to politics in a bid to help the party win the 2015 general election . The Observer reports that the top-secret note came from campaign chief Douglas Alexander's office. The reappointment of Mr Campbell will likely come as a surprise to Miliband's supporters. During his leadership campaign he distanced himself from the New Labour policies and tactics which Mr Campbell pioneered, winning him the support of the unions and far left. In a Total Politics interview in October, he criticised members of Mr Miliband's shadow cabinet for not having a higher profile, claiming they needed to show more 'energy and fight'. Mr Campbell will be brought in by party leader Ed Miliband, and will join a number of other New Labour figures - including former Health Secretary Alan Milburn - in returning to the frontline of party politics .

Momentum is building up behind getting Gordon Brown to return to frontline politics to win support for the independence referendum. There are fears that the Better Together campaign has no ‘fire in its belly’ and could end up being outfoxed by Alex Salmond’s nationalist . One Cabinet minister said: ‘We could be in real danger, we are not in any way complacent about this. The independence side have an easier sell.’ The source said there was even talk of the former Prime Minister Mr Brown being brought ‘out of self-imposed exile’ to lead the campaign. ‘We have to remember he is more popular in Scotland than he is in the rest of the country. But God help us if it takes Gordon to win the referendum.’ Labour’s own anti-separation campaign, United with Labour, is using Mr Brown as its frontman. Sources said he would be ready to play a starring role in the main campaign if called on to do so and has already spoken about the economic stumbling blocks for an independent Scotland. Mr Campbell said . during the conference season at both the Labour and Tory gatherings he . was told he should get involved in the 2015 campaign. During the interview, Mr Campbell said that he wanted Mr Miliband to take on critics who call him a 'geek'. He said: 'For somebody to come up there and say, ""you're a geek, you haven't got charisma"", somebody to come on and say, ""yeah, you speak quite well but you're not Tony Blair, you're no Barack Obama"", he can then say, ""no, I'm not Blair, I'm me; this is what I am.

A computer system handling the  Government’s flagship Universal Credit scheme cannot cope with the ‘complicated’ lives led by millions of families, ministers admitted yesterday. The Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) will today announce £40million of new IT equipment has already been written off. A further £91million of bespoke software will become defunct when the system is operational in 2017, although the department insisted this was ‘not a write-off’. Pressure: Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith was grilled by MPs about the costs and timings of his flagship welfare reform . The computer system is so limited that . benefits claims involving couples or  families have to be dealt with . manually, MPs were told yesterday. Work . and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith angrily denied the scheme was . in chaos, telling the Commons work and pensions committee: ‘There is no . debacle on Universal Credit.’ But . trouble-shooter Howard Shiplee, who was brought in this year to rescue . the £2.4billion scheme, said it still faced major challenges in dealing . with all but the most straightforward benefit claims. He said the . automated system could not currently deal with claims involving couples . or children. A tiny pilot scheme involving just 2,000 people had focused . almost exclusively on young single men, whose claims are . straightforward. Officials . have to make manual checks if a claimant moves in with a partner or has a . child. The DWP said last night the IT problems had to be set against . the estimated £38billion of economic benefits that Universal Credit . could eventually bring. There is growing unease in government that the most ambitious change to the welfare system for 60 years is falling behind schedule. Grilling: Mr Duncan Smith (second left) was flanked by key advisers, including (l-r) Universal Credit director general Howard Shipley, welfare reform minister Lord Freud and DWP finance director Mike Driver . The government has abandoned the idea of all services being 'digital by default'. David Cameron ordered all departments to make the internet the first port of call for all services. But the man in charge of the huge Universal Credit welfare reform admitted that the benefits would not be 'digital first'. Howard Shiplee (pictured) was challenged by MPs about the dramatic shift in policy. The director general of Universal Credit said: 'Digital by default as far as I am concerned went away a long time ago. That's my understanding very clearly.' He went on: 'It is working. There is this constant suggestion it is not working. It works.' Labour has seized on figures which . show that only a tiny fraction of the numbers due to be using the new . system by the time of the 2015 general election would be transferred on . time. Only a ‘handful’ of . the promised 1.7 million would be switched by 2014-15 and only 400,000 . by the following year - less than 10 per cent of the original target, . the Opposition said. As recently as October Mr Duncan Smith insisted his it was still on track. But he has conceded that as many as 700,000 claimants will now face a longer wait before being transferred to the new system. Earlier he refused to comment on Labour’s . figures, but admitted: ‘I do accept, of course, that this plan is . different from the original plan.’ Some 700,000 disabled people will not be transferred by the deadline because of the complexity of their claims. Millions of other benefit claimants who were due to be transferred to the new system in the next 18 months will now not do so until well after the election. The delay is embarrassing for Mr Duncan Smith, who has staked his reputation on the delivery of the scheme, which is designed to ensure it always pays people to work. Universal Credit will combine Jobseeker’s Allowance, income-related Employment and Support Allowance, Income Support, Working Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit and housing benefit. Speaking ahead of his appearance before the Commons Work and Pensions Committee, Mr Duncan Smith said the delay was to allow the most vulnerable claimants more time to adjust to the change. ‘We could easily have tried to rush those people in but we have decided not to,’ he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ‘They are the people who don't have any work requirement on them and they have had the biggest change going through the work capability assessment and therefore they need time to get through. I think it is only fair to give them longer.’ Ministers claim the initial roll-out . of Universal Credit - which combines six means-tested benefits into one . monthly payment designed to ensure people are better-off working than on . benefits - has been a success. They . point to figures suggesting it is encouraging more people to look for . jobs in what Mr Duncan Smith described as a ‘cultural shift’. Shake-up: Universal Credit will combine Jobseeker's Allowance, income-related Employment and Support Allowance, Income Support, Working Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit and housing benefit . But critics say the limited implementation of the scheme - which has been plagued by IT and other problems - only involve the least challenging cases. And it was branded ‘inadequate’ and open to fraud in a scathing report by a cross-party committee. The Commons Public Accounts Committee found that at least £140 million had already been wasted on the project, which was blighted by ‘alarmingly weak’ management. Labour's shadow work and pensions Rachel Reeves said the reforms were now in chaos . In October, Mr Duncan Smith told the Commons: 'Universal credit will roll out very well and it will be on time and within budget.' Today Rachel Reeves, Labour’s shadow work and pensions secretary, said the scheme was in chaos and urged Mr Duncan Smith to hold cross-party talks to rescue it. ‘David Cameron and Iain Duncan Smith repeatedly promised to deliver their flagship policy “on time and within budget”. ‘That claim, and the credibility they staked on it, now lie in tatters. ‘For months on end, the Government have tried to avoid answering questions about Universal Credit but these OBR figures tell the truth of how (they) have broken their promises on a spectacular scale. ‘They have been forced to admit that they have completely missed their targets and Universal Credit will not now be rolled out before the election. ‘David Cameron and Iain Duncan Smith are presiding over a complete mess and it is taxpayers who are picking up the bill with at least £100 million of their money written off."" Giving evidence alongside Mr Duncan Smith at the Work and Pensions Select Committee will be Howard Shiplee, the former London Olympics executive drafted in earlier this year to ‘reset’ the programme amid growing concerns over delays and IT issues. He may also be questioned about reports - which he denies - that he sought to have MPs pin blame for the failures on Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) chief civil servant Robert Devereux. In written evidence to the committee, the DWP said it was ‘confident that it has taken, and continues to take, the right remedial steps to address past issues in the Universal Credit programme’.","Universal Credit due to combine a raft of benefits into one by 2017 .

Two days after the messages were found, the victim's parents are said . to have confronted Semak who told them: 'I have been stupid'. However, the victim told her parents she did not want police to be contacted. However, she later told a teacher at school and officers were called in. Accused: PC Christopher Semak began the relationship in April 2010 and had sex with the girl on a number of occasions, Stafford Crown Court heard . In a police interview three days later she told officers that the she and Semak had began flirting in March 2010. She . also claimed Semak said to her 'can you not tell anyone I've been . texting you because it does look a bit weird, a 30-year-old that's . texting a 14-year-old'.

Jackson told the jury the pair first had sex during the Easter holidays in April when Semak allegedly invited the girl round to watch a DVD . in his bedroom. Semak was arrested in January 2012, the court heard, and gave detectives a prepared statement claiming the girl had asked him for advice. Trial: Semak denies five charges of sexual activity with a child and his case is expected to last two weeks . The teenager had threatened to falsely inform the police that they had had sex, Simek said, prompting him to 'stupidly' respond to her texts. In his statement to the police, Semak claimed: 'I feared she would make a false allegation if I did not respond in this way.' Concluding his opening speech to the jury, Mr Jackson said Semak’s case was that his victim had 'invented' her account and then blackmailed him. All of the charges relate to alleged sexual activity while the officer was off duty.

A 13-month old boy died from internal bleeding after swallowing a battery, an inquest heard. Wsam Noorwali was rushed to hospital when his parents found him vomiting blood at their home in Hamilton, Leicester. Just under nine hours later he was pronounced dead, and a post-mortem examination revealed a three-volt disc battery the size of a 2p piece in the toddler’s stomach. At an inquest into the little boy's . death at Leicester Town Hall, his father Ammar, 32, said he believed the . child had swallowed the battery at the nursery he attended in the city. Wsam Noorwali, 13 months, pictured with his parents Fatima and Ammar, died after swallowing a battery . Beloved son: Little Wsam was taken ill at home - his father saw him vomiting blood at their home in Leicester . Mr Noorwali said he found his son in pain on the evening on 18 August last year. He said: 'At about 10pm, the family was downstairs in the living room.  I went upstairs to go to the toilet and Wsam must have crawled up after me. 'When I left the bathroom, I heard him crying and saw him at the door to my bedroom. 'I saw him vomit blood.' Mr Noorwali, a PhD researcher at Leicester De Montfort University, took Wsam in his car, with wife Fatima and their other son, to the city’s Royal Infirmary hospital. The hearing was told Wsam was assessed by a doctor at the children’s emergency department before being moved to a ward. His condition at first improved, but at 2.30am and 4am, he suffered further bouts of vomiting. The youngster was given a blood . transfusion and transferred to the children’s intensive care unit, where . his condition deteriorated. The little boy may have picked up the battery at the nursery he attended, his father Ammar told an inquest . Wsam''s parents described their toddler as a 'wonderful', 'happy' boy who was 'always smiling' He was given another blood . transfusion, but doctors said he was too weak for an emergency . operation. Wsam’s heart stopped and medical staff were unable to revive . him. Mr . Noorwali said: 'We were asked to go outside but a while later I saw . doctors and medical staff run past us into the emergency unit.' He added medics tried and tried to save Wsam but after an hour they told him his son had died. Mr . Noorwali told the inquest he was convinced his son had swallowed . something and pleaded with doctors to investigate, but to no avail. He said: 'I told them I thought he may have swallowed something which was stuck in his throat, but the doctor said ""We need to cure him first, leave it to me"". Mrs Noorwali said at one point her husband was so angry he was warned about his behaviour. 'I told them I thought he may have swallowed something which was stuck in his throat but the doctor said ""We need to cure him first, leave it to me"".' - Ammar Noorwali, 32, Wsam's father . 'One doctor said to my husband ""If you continue to behave like this we are going to call security"",' she said. Mr Noorwali said they did not see Wsam swallow anything in the days before his death - but added he was prone to putting things in his mouth. He ruled out the battery coming from the family home and said he suspected Wsam could have swallowed it at the nursery he attended in Leicester. He told the inquest a member of staff told him they had once found Wsam playing with rubbish in the office bin. Wsam Noorwali died in August last year, nine hours after his parents rushed to hospital . Wsam's family believes he may have swallowed the battery at the nursery he attended (pictured) James Stafford, owner of the nursery, . which was not named during the hearing, said it was not possible Wsam . could have been playing with rubbish because the door was always closed . and the office always attended. He said none of the toys in the playroom had disc batteries. Dr Roger Malcomson, who carried out the post-mortem examination on Wsam, said he found a three-volt disc battery 'corroded at the edges' which was the size of a 2p piece in the boy’s stomach. Dr Malcomson said he found evidence of extensive bleeding in the stomach, with burning and tissue damage to Wsam’s gullet which suggested the battery could have been stuck there for several days. He told the hearing the vomiting fit could have dislodged the battery, causing it to pass into the stomach, where it would have caused the damage it did in a few hours. The inquest continues. Outside the inquest, Mr Noorwali said: 'Wsam was a wonderful boy.  He was playing all the time and seemed so happy. 'He was always smiling and loved playing with his older brother.  He was just starting to walk and talk and we miss him very much.' He added: 'It has been a very difficult 16 months.'

David Cameron today hailed Nelson Mandela as a ‘towering figure’ as Parliament cleared its agenda for eight hours of tributes to the former South African president. But the Prime Minister’s moving homage to Mr Mandela’s ‘enduring place in history’ risked being undermined when he tweeted during the opening speeches. Just minutes after the Commons session began, Mr Cameron’s official account released a picture of himself, with ITV’s Little Ant and Dec admiring a reindeer. Tributes: Prime Minister David Cameron hailed Nelson Mandela as a 'towering figure' as he gave the first of eight hours of speeches in the Commons . Gaffe: As Labour leader Ed Miliband began his tribute to Mr Mandela, Mr Cameron's Twitter account posted this picture of a reindeer . Addressing a packed House of Commons, Mr Cameron told MPs: ‘Nelson Mandela was a towering figure in our lifetime - a pivotal figure in the history of South Africa and the world - and it is right that we meet in this Parliament to pay tribute to his character, his achievements and his legacy.’ It is the first time that MPs have met since Mr Mandela’s death was announced on Thursday night. In the first speech of the day, Mr Cameron said: ‘When looking back over history, it can be easy to see victories over prejudice and hatred as somehow inevitable. ‘As the years lengthen and events recede, it can seem as though a natural tide of progress continually bears humanity ever upwards away from brutality and darkness and towards something better. ‘But is not so. Progress is not just handed down as a gift, it is won through struggle: …the struggle of men and women who believe things can be better, who refuse to accept the world as it is, but dream of what it can be. ‘Nelson Mandela was the embodiment of that struggle.  He did not see himself as a helpless victim of history, he wrote it.’ Mr Cameron recalled meeting Mr Mandela when Tory opposition leader in 2008 on a visit to London . Preparations: Work continues on a massive arena on the property of former South African President Nelson Mandela ahead of his state burial service on Sunday, in Qunu . A giant arena is being built in view of Nelson Mandela's home to stage the biggest funeral in South Africa's history for him. Final . preparations are being made before more than 70 world leaders fly in . this week to attend a series of events to mark the extraordinary life of . one of humanity's great peacemakers. They include Cuban . leader Raul Castro and Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe who could rub shoulders . with British Prime Minister David Cameron and Prince Charles in an . unprecedented gathering. Among the mourners heading to South Africa this week will be figures from the worlds of music, business and fashion. Tycoon Sir Richard Branson, supermodel Naomi Campbell and musicians Bono, Annie Lennox and Peter Gabriel are expected at the memorial service on Tuesday. Sir Richard and singer Peter . Gabriel devised 'The Elders' forum of statesmen and activists set . up by Mr Mandela. U2 singer and activist Bono, 53, said the anti-apartheid icon had inspired him to campaign against Aids and world poverty. Miss . Campbell, 43, who Mr Mandela described as his 'honorary granddaughter', . has helped raise money for the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund and his . former political party the African National Congress. Grammy-award winning artist Annie Lennox, 58, has a long association with Mr Mandela after performing at his 70th birthday concert in 1988. Three previous prime ministers - Sir John Major, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown - are to join current PM David Cameron at the official memorial ceremony. Also attending the national memorial service in Johannesburg’s FNB Stadium will be Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and Leader of the Opposition Ed Miliband, said Downing Street. It . is thought to be the first time for many years that all of the UK’s . surviving prime ministers have travelled to an event abroad, and . reflects the deep respect in which Mr Mandela is held within British . politics. Among those expected to be there are U.S. President Barack Obama and United Nations secretary -general Ban Ki-moon. Former U.S. presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Jimmy Carter will also be there. At the funeral, political guests will include Czech Foreign Minister Jan Kohout – who is representing his country in place of its prime minister Jiri Rusnok. Mr Rusnok was forced to apologise after he was recorded saying: 'The idea of going gives me the shivers.' Today, . South Africa's government released the list of speakers for the Tuesday . memorial, expected to last four hours at stadium at Soweto Township . near Johannesburg. Beyond Obama and Ban, the government says the following leaders will speak: . - Brazil President Dilma Rousseff; - Chinese Vice President Li Yuanchao; - Namibian President Hifikepunye Pohamba; - Indian President Pranab Mukherjee; and - Cuban President Raul Castro. South . African President Jacob Zuma will give the keynote address. Mr . Mandela's family and friends also will speak at the ceremony, which will . include a sermon. But moments later the Twitter account @David_Cameron posted a message saying: ‘With Little Ant & Little Dec ahead of a tough #TextSanta interview. You can see it on Dec 20 @ITVTextSanta.’ Little Ant and Dec are junior look-a-likes of ITV stars Ant and Dec, who are seen interviewing celebrities as part of Saturday Night Takeaway. Text Santa is an ITV festive charity fundraiser. The inappropriate time of the post was immediately spotted by Twitter users. Friends of the Eart campaigner Oliver Hayes said: ‘Odd thing to tweet while listening to @Ed_Miliband paying tribute to Mandela.’ Mr Miliband told the Commons Mr Mandela can truly call himself the father of a nation. Labour leader Ed Miliband and Lib Dem Nick Clegg also addressed the Commons during the tributes . Several MPs referred to the Nelson Mandela statue which looks across Parliament Square towards the House of Parliament, which has become a focus for floral tributes . The Labour leader reflected that Mr . Mandela himself said he was no saint, but a sinner who kept on trying, . and said he left a fight against injustice which must continue in . Britain and around the world. And . he said: ‘It is in the spirit of what Nelson Mandela taught us to . acknowledge the truth about the past, and without rancour to welcome the . change that has come to pass. ‘But . also to honour his legacy, by acknowledging in every country, including . our own, the battle against racial injustice still needs to be won.' Ex-prime minister Gordon Brown made a rare appearance in the Commons today to pay tribute to Nelson Mandela. The Labour MP, who has spoken just six times since losing power in 2010, said Mr Mandela who taught the world that 'no injustice can last forever'. Mr Brown, who was the first MP to speak after the three main party leaders, paid homage to the man he described as being as great 'as the continent he loved'. Recalling that he unveiled a statue of Mr Mandela before the former ANC president, Mr Brown described the monument with its hands outstretched, 'but his finger pointing upwards, as it always did, to the heights: the man most responsible for the destruction of what people thought was indestructible, the apartheid system. 'The man that taught us no injustice can last forever.' Mr Miliband added: 'So we come here to honour the man, to acknowledge our history and also for one final reason: to recognise and uphold the universal value for which Nelson Mandela stood, the dignity of every person whatever their colour or creed, values of tolerance and respect for all, and justice for all people wherever they may live and whatever oppression they may face. ‘His extraordinary life calls on us all to keep on trying, for nobler ideals, for higher purposes, and for a bigger and not a smaller politics, inspired by his example and the movement he lead. ‘We mourn his loss, we give thanks for his life and we honour his legacy.’ Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said Mr Mandela's upholding of the principles of truth and reconciliation after being released from prison and becoming South Africa's first black president laid down a blueprint for other societies ridden with conflict and division to follow. He said Northern Ireland had learnt lessons from the anti-apartheid hero and called on Sri Lanka to follow his example to bring the country peace and unity after decades of civil war. Mr Clegg said: 'Given the enormity of his achievements we're all struggling to work out the best way to honour his legacy. 'I like to think that one of the things he would like us to do in this House today is to pay tribute to and support the individuals and the organisations around the world that fight for human rights and do not have a global name. 'Right now all over the world there are millions of men, women and children still struggling to overcome poverty, violence, discrimination. 'They do not have the fame or the standing of Nelson Mandela but I'm sure that he would tell us that what they achieve and endure in their pursuit of a more open, equal and just society shapes all our lives.'","Prime Minister opens debate on death of ex-South African President .

It is the spiritual home of the Church of England - but Canterbury is failing to get in the Christmas mood after after Scrooge-like council bosses refused to spend money on festive lights. Local residents have complained that the decision has left the historic city centre looking 'dark and depressing' with some saying it reminds them of the war days. But John Gilbey, Canterbury City Council leader, insists leaving the high street without Christmas lights is the right thing to do in the face of its growing budget crisis. Protest: Traders have staged protests after Canterbury City Council refused to spend money on Christmas lights for the high street . The council has been ordered to make savings of £5.5million by 2017, and cutting the funding for illuminations will spare £56,000 - but traders are furious at the council's attitude. The Kent city is home to Canterbury Cathedral - the most important place of worship in the Anglican Church - where the Archbishop of Canterbury, leader of the Church of England delivers his Christmas sermon on Christmas Day. John Hippisley, leader of the Canterbury Independent Traders Alliance, said: 'It beggars belief that Canterbury - the very cradle of Christianity - doesn't have any Christmas lights. Action: Campaigners organised a protest to put pressure on the council to reverse its decision . 'Every town and city up and down England has Christmas lights, but here we have none. It's a public disgrace. 'All the little businesses are really struggling in the recession and they were banking on Christmas trade to help them through. It's the most important time of year for them. 'But without any Christmas lights, the city just looks dull, dark and depressing. One pensioner told me it felt like the war, all over again.' He said he fears customers will go to the nearby shopping centre in Bluewater as it's more appealing with 'fantastic Christmas lights'. 'Traders have told me that trade is much worse than last Christmas and it's a real worry,' he said. Meanwhile campaigner Steve Coombs . organised a protest march through the city last weekend to put pressure . on the council to reverse its decision. He . said: 'A lot of people are dismayed about the lack of Christmas lights. The council have underspent by nearly £1million this year, so why can't . they afford some lights?' Only the Whitefriars precinct and the King's Mile in Canterbury have lights to lift the mood. These have been funded privately, . although a grant from the council was put towards the display in . independent traders' area King's Mile. A local business has paid for a Christmas tree in the city centre, with the council paying around £2,000 to decorate it. Darkness: Canterbury high street appears 'dark and depressing' compared to other town centres, which are festooned with Christmas lights . Disgrace: Traders have labelled the decision a 'public disgrace', and pensioner said the darkness made it feel 'like the war' Mr Hippisley added: 'I looked into the . costs of hiring and putting up Christmas lights in the high street, but . the public liability insurance would have cost £7,000, making it . prohibitively expensive. 'The . council has the money, but they don't want to celebrate Christmas. Instead they've squirreled away £103,000 for re-paving an area of the . city that does not need repaving and they've set aside £17,000 to . refurbish the Lord Mayor's robes. 'Does anyone even care about the Lord Mayor's robes? I know most people here would prefer to have some Christmas lights.' Cradle of Christianity: The city is home to Canterbury Cathedral where the Archbishop of Canterbury, leader of the Church of England delivers his Christmas sermon on December 25 . A spokesman from Canterbury City Council said that start-up grants totalling around £10,000 have been given to community and business groups . in Herne Bay and Whitstable to help them take over the organisation of the lights in their towns. Councillor . Gilbey said: 'It was inevitable that this day would come.

'Much has been said in the media and elsewhere about cuts in council funding. This is one very real example of its impact' He added: 'As the money goes down, we are going to have to take more difficult decisions not to do things, in order to protect important frontline services and the services we are required to provide by law. 'It's not an easy message, but I think people need to be prepared to see more of the things they like disappearing in the years ahead.'","Council cut illuminations to save £56,000 in face of shrinking budget .

One man has taken on the role of protecting Earth from world-ending asteroids from his home observatory in Wales. While the sky-watching base might look more rural and less impressive then the vast shiny centres seen in Hollywood films, Jay Tate, 58, now has the UK’s only earthbound asteroid and comet tracking station. Every night he spends hours scouring the skies with a two-tonne telescope, monitoring large space rocks hurtling towards Earth and keeps a direct line to Nasa free for emergencies. Every night Jay Tate and his wife spend hours scouring the skies with a two-tonne telescope (pictured) to monitor large space rocks hurtling towards Earth. Mr Tate, who lives in Powys,Wales, keeps a direct line to NASA free for emergencies . Using a global list of known asteroids, Mr Tate observes their paths from his home observatory, which he shares with wife Anne in Knightood, Powys, Wales, while a series of robotic telescopes comb the sky for others. A former Royal Artillery Soldier, Mr Tate has survived on his army pension for 15 years after taking up the armageddon-preventing position. He paid for the expensive equipment, which he chose and installed so that he can track the space rocks, by using his own savings, money from his pension and donations from people backing the cause. He said: 'It’s not exactly a glamorous job, being an unknown protector, but someone has to do it and we are absolutely more than happy to step up. 'Of course it would be nice if we got paid for it, as an army pension doesn’t pay much these days, but until then will we just keep on going. Jay Tate, 58, now has the UK¿s only earthbound asteroid and comet tracking station and receives no funding for checking that asteroids are not on a collision path with Earth (illustrated) 'Since the country needs a centre like this and there is no one else to do it, we decided we would take it on. 'We have very good links with Nasa - they’re very much aware we’re the only eyes on the sky in Britain.' From their detached village home, Mr and Mrs Tate operate the International Spaceguard Centre, after Leicester’s National Space Centre cut its project earlier this year. After failing to secure a £360,000 grant to probe the solar system and beyond for asteroids, the undeterred pair continued to operate. Each morning they wake up, carry out any necessary maintenance and admin duties and conduct public tours for amateur astronomers and schoolchildren in the afternoon. Using a global list of known asteroids, Mr Tate (pictured) observes the paths of asteroids from his home observatory, which he shares with wife Anne in Knightood, Powys, Wales, while a series of robotic telescopes comb the sky for others . Kevin Yates, exhibition development manager at the National Space Centre said the Leicester-based centre operated the NEO Information Centre (NEOIC) for 10 years under contract from the UK government, which included daily monitoring of the risk from newly discovered asteroids and comets. 'We produced regular reports to Government on specific NEOs [near Earth objects] that rated above zero on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale and issued a monthly close approach report,' he told MailOnline. In 2012 the UK government took a decision to cease funding and the NEOIC at the National Space Centre closed. A spokesman for the UK Space Agency said: 'Even the very modest funds to support this activity could not be justified against a backdrop of reduced government funding and a growing emphasis on space for delivering growth to the economy.' Mr Yates said: 'We gave permission to Jay Tate at Spaceguard UK to use the name NEOIC.' But when the sun goes down the dedicated duo turn their attention skywards. Mr Tate said: 'Fortunately there are no known directly earthbound asteroids - that’s where we come in and help to identify if there are. 'We’re currently tracking a number that may eventually come close, while the telescopes will hunt for new ones. 'Everyone knows the sheer calamity of an asteroid striking the earth - from the extinction of dinosaurs to the 1,600 people injured during a small shower in Chelyabinsk, Russia, last year.' The Spaceguard Centre won the Europlanet Prize for public engagement and planetary science this year. They are currently in the process of . installing a 24inch six-and-a-half tonne Smitt camera wide-field . telescope so it can look for new hazards as well as track existing ones. The telescope is currently in storage, while the money is raised for a dome to house it. There . is currently no UK Government funding for the trailing of asteroids and . the couple are hoping to raise attention in the UK, rather than . pursuing help across the pond. Mr Tate said: 'In the UK there is absolutely no system set up; there is nobody to telephone. Pictured with his two-tonne telescope, Mr Tate said it is about time that the UK plays a part in the global asteroid-watching project. he said the country has no capability to spot smaller objects but an asteroid 50 metres across could obliterate an area the size of greater London . 'We deal directly with America and would have to do the same if we wanted to get the word out. 'The UK doesn’t play any part in the global project so it’s about time they did. 'We do not have the capability to spot smaller objects but something 50 metres across could completely take out an area the size of greater London. 'If something was heading towards us then a possible deflection mission could be mounted to stop it hitting the earth. 'But it would be up to the Americans as we couldn’t do anything about it here.' Mr Tate uses a global list of known asteroids to decide which ones to pay close attention to. His Spaceguard Centre won the Europlanet Prize for public engagement and planetary science this year as he and his wife show schoolchildren and amateur astronomers their ambitious project . However, the picture is not too bleak. A spokesman for the UK Space Agency told MailOnline that amateur astronomers such as Mr Tate are making 'significant discoveries.' He said that even school children are playing their part as students at Reading School have recently installed a new observatory, which is being used to search for asteroids, among other celestial objects. The school has been congratulated by Apollo 9 astronaut, Rusty Schweickart who spent over 10 days in space as a lunar pilot in 1969. He said: 'I am very pleased to hear of this development and its potential use for detecting and tracking Near Earth Objects (NEOs). Mr Tate, who is pictured here with a small telescope, said: 'We have very good links with NASA - they¿re very much aware we¿re the only eyes on the sky in Britain' 'This is an issue that my fellow astronauts and cosmonauts in the Association of Space Explorers consider of prime importance and we welcome the contribution that your facility might make.' However, while volunteers are monitoring potential threats to life on Earth, there are no plans for an 'official' UK asteroid detection facility. The UK Space Agency Spokesman said: 'The vast majority of UK funding for space is channeled through the European Space Agency (ESA). 'The European Space Agency does address NEOs on behalf on its Member States...as it recognises they are a global hazard, not unique to any country and that they require an international response.' This is partly so countries can share the cost and because any solutions to asteroids on a collision course to earth require cohesive global action, he explained. Speaking about Mr Tate's role, he said: 'I consider Jay a professional in the field and he has a unique and valuable contribution to make. 'Although he may not have followed the normal route, he is a gifted communicator, a very savvy operator and his previous academic engagement on the issue brought much-needed intellectual rigour to the problem when the nascent NEO programmes were being developed in the late 90's. He continues to act as a champion for the issue.'","Jay Tate, 58, now has UK’s only earthbound asteroid and comet tracking station called the Spaceguard Centre, which is based in Powys, Wales .

One of the biggest quests in physics, the search for the enigmatic substance known as dark matter, has failed to provide answers. The Large Underground Xenon (LUX) experiment, the world’s most advanced test to find this elusive material, yesterday completed its first 90-day run. Located 4,580 feet (1,400 metres) beneath the ground at a former gold mine in South Dakota, LUX experiments have so far come back empty handed. The Large Underground Xenon experiment, the world's most advanced test to find this elusive material, yesterday completed its first 90-day run without finding any dark matter . The researchers now plan to create a similar detector that is 1,000 more powerful next year. Dark matter is thought to make up 27 per cent of the universe, but experiments have failed to confirm its presence. It is considered crucial to theories explaining how the universe is expanding and how galaxies interact. Scientists are fairly sure it exists, but they do not know what it looks like or where to find it. The LUX detector is lined with white teflon to better gather faint signals of light that will be recorded by the photomultiplier tubes. Water - 70,000 gallons of it - provides further protection from background radiation . Dark matter accounts for most of the mass in the Universe - around 27 per cent. It surrounds galaxies across the universe, and is invisible because it does not reflect light. It cannot be seen directly with telescopes, but astronomers know it to be out there because of the gravitational effects it has on the matter we can see. Galaxies, for example, could not rotate the way they do and hold their shape without the presence of dark matter, researchers say. The European Space Agency says: 'Shine a torch in a completely dark room, and you will see only what the torch illuminates. 'That does not mean that the room around you does not exist. 'Similarly we know dark matter exists but have never observed it directly.' Scientists are fairly sure it exists and . is crucial to the universe, but they do not know what it looks like or . where to find it. Astronomers have only been able to theorise its existence through the gravitational effects it has on matter in the universe. One way of testing for it is to use detectors deep underground, such as LUX, to try and detect the moment dark matter particles pass through the Earth. Scientists hoped LUX’s location deep underground would trap dark matter, which would be revealed through weakly interacting massive particles, dubbed WIMPS. Millions of these WIMPs are thought to be travelling through regular matter without us knowing it. In both theory and practice, collisions between WIMPs and normal matter are rare and extremely difficult to detect. This is because a constant rain of cosmic radiation from space can drown out the faint signals. As well as being underground, LUX is further protected from background radiation from the surrounding rock by immersion in a tank of ultra-pure water. At the heart of the experiment is a . 6-foot-tall titanium tank filled with almost a third of a tonne of . liquid xenon, cooled to minus 150 degrees Fahrenheit. If a WIMP strikes an atom of an element named xenon, it recoils from other xenon atoms and emits light and electrons. The . electrons are drawn upward by an electrical field and interact with a . thin layer of xenon gas at the top of the tank, releasing more photons. Lux is located 4,580 feet (1,400 meters) beneath the ground at a former gold mine in South Dakota . Photomultiplier tubes capable of detecting a single photon of light line the top and bottom of the LUX dark matter detector. They will record the position and intensity of collisions between dark matter particles and xenon nuclei . Light detectors in the top and bottom of the tank are each capable of detecting a single photon. The locations of the two photon signals – one at the collision point, the other at the top of the tank – can be pinpointed to within a few millimeters. The energy of the interaction can be precisely measured from the brightness of the signals. So far, however, that hasn't happened. The team said that this absence also ruled out the possibility that other detectors had seen glimpses of dark matter. ‘This is only the beginning for LUX’, said physicist Dan McKinsey of Yale University. ‘Now that we understand the instrument and its backgrounds, we will continue to take data, testing for more and more elusive candidates for dark matter.’ Planning for the next-generation dark matter experiment at the Sanford Lab already is under way. Compared to LUX’s third of a tonne of liquid xenon, the LUX-ZEPLIN, or LZ, experiment would have a seven tonne liquid xenon target inside the same 72,000-gallon tank of pure water used by LUX. ‘LZ will be a thousand times more sensitive than the LUX detector,” said Tom Shutt, the spokesman for LZ. ‘It will just begin to see an irreducible background of neutrinos that may ultimately set the limit to our ability to measure dark matter.’ 1 - As well as being underground, LUX is . further protected from background radiation from the surrounding rock by . immersion in a tank of ultra-pure water. 2 - Closed loop of liquid nitrogen condensation/evaporation provides 1 kW cooling power to the detector. 3 - At the heart of the experiment is a . 6-foot-tall titanium tank filled with almost a third of a tonne of . liquid xenon, cooled to minus 150 degrees Fahrenheit. 4 - If a WIMP strikes a xenon atom it recoils from other xenon atoms and emits light and electrons. 5 - The . electrons are drawn upward by an electrical field and interact with a . thin layer of xenon gas at the top of the tank, releasing more photons.Light detectors in the top and bottom of the tank are each capable of detecting a single photon . 6 - The internal supporting frame is composed of two PMT copper holder plates and titanium straps.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 12:21 EST, 7 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:22 EST, 7 October 2013 . An appeals court has sided with an Ohio hospital that wants to force a 10-year-old Amish girl to resume chemotherapy after her parents decided to stop the treatments. The court ruled that the parents' beliefs cannot outweight the state's rights to protect the girl, Sarah Hershberger, and an attorney was granted immediate, limited guardianship over her, as well as the ability to make medical decisions for her. Doctors at Akron Children's Hospital believe Sarah's leukemia is treatable but says she will die without chemotherapy. The hospital went to court after the family decided to stop chemotherapy and treat Sarah with natural medicines, such as herbs and vitamins. This is the second time the court has sided with the hospital. Battle: A court has ruled that Akron Childrens Hospital, pictured, in Ohio can administer chemotherapy to a 10-year-old Amish cancer sufferer after her parents stopped the treatment . The appeals court ruling, issued last week, overturns a judge's decision that said that keeping the parents from making medical decisions for their daughter would take away their right. 'While we respect the wishes of the parents and believe them to be honest and sincere, we are unwilling to adhere to the wishes of the parents,' the appeals court judges wrote. The beliefs and convictions of the parents can't outweigh the rights of the state to protect the child, the court said. It also ordered that the guardian should be appointed right away. Andy Hershberger, the girl's father, . said the family agreed to begin two years of treatments for Sarah last . spring but stopped in June because it was making her extremely sick. Sarah begged her parents to stop the chemotherapy and they agreed after a great deal of prayer, Hershberger said. The . family, members of an insular Amish community, shuns many facets of . modern life and is deeply religious. They live on a farm and operate a . produce stand near the village of Spencer in Medina County, about 35 . miles southwest of Cleveland. But . hospital officials have said that they are morally and legally . obligated to make sure the girl receives proper care. They said the . girl's illness, lymphoblastic lymphoma, is an aggressive form of . non-Hodgkin lymphoma, but there is a high survival rate with treatment. Traditions: Sarah Hershberger (not pictured) and her family are Amish, and their beliefs force them to shun technology and some forms of modern medicine. They also did not want to see Sarah suffer . The appeals court noted that a county probate court investigator found that Sarah is not in remission and will die without chemotherapy. The ruling said that while adults can refuse medical treatment regardless of the consequences, children do not have those same rights because of their vulnerability and inability to make critical decisions in a mature manner. While state laws give parents a great deal of freedom when it comes to choosing medical treatment for their children, that's not always true when the decision could be a matter of life or death. Courts most often will draw the line when doctors think the child's life is in danger and there's a good chance that the treatments being suggested will work, according to several medical ethicists.","Sarah Hershberger's parents halted her chemotherapy in June when she became too sick and begged for them to stop .

Two drug dealers growing £500,000-worth of cannabis in their flat have been jailed for a total of more than 13 years after neighbours reported a potent smell to police. Mohammed Fazal, 27, and Zafran Ali, 19 were using the property as headquarters for their large-scale drugs business on Manchester's streets. Alongside 50 cannabis plants, they had thousands of pounds worth of heroin, cocaine, and crack cocaine strewn around the place. The plot unravelled after their neighbours began to notice a permanent smell of cannabis leaking into their home and asked police to investigate. Jailed: Mohammed Fazal (left) received an eight-year sentence and Zafran Ali (right) was jailed for five-and-a-half years after both pleaded guilty to possession of drugs. They used a Rochdale flat as their headquarters . Greater Manchester Police raided the . flat in April and found a large growth facility, where the cannabis plants had . recently been harvested. Police said they were able to link the drugs to Ali, who was later arrested at his home nearby in Oswald Street. Yesterday, Fazal and Ali pleaded guilty . to drug possession and were jailed for eight years and five-and-a-half . years respectively at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court. The . plants had a wholesale value of £14,250 and a street value of £42,825. Police also found more than 330g of heroin, worth about £33,020, 110g or . £5,500 of cocaine, and 121g of crack cocaine with a street value of . £12,128. About 4kg of heroin was found on those premises, hidden in the base of a bed. Enterprise: Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court heard the pair harvested £500,000-worth of cannabis plants . Police said the 60 per cent pure heroin was worth £400,000 on the street, but could be cut with other substances to potentially net more than £1 million when sold to users. Rochdale Organised Crime Unit PC Simon Meekings said the haul would have brought an 'immeasurable amount of misery' to the streets of Rochdale. 'I would like to thank the Rochdale community for their assistance in bringing the illicit operations of Zafran Ali and Mohammed Fazal to the attention of the police,' he said. More drugs: Police raided the place in April after neighbours detected a smell and also found heroin and cocaine . 'The sentences today will no doubt serve as a deterrent to anyone else who think they can make money delving into this abhorrent trade.' Detective Inspector Lee Hopwood, of Rochdale North, said the case showed law enforcement's commitment to crack down on drug crime. 'Drug dealers are a blight on our communities and the police at Rochdale are committed to identifying these individuals and bringing them to justice,' he said.","Mohammed Fazal, 27, and Zafran Ali, 19, used Rochdale flat as cannabis farm .

Veteran politician: Former barrister Ken Clarke's comments are likely to reignite the row over the veil . Muslim women should not wear the full-face veil in court because it is difficult to give evidence from inside ‘a kind of bag,’ Ken Clarke said yesterday. The minister, a former barrister, believes women should wear what they want in public – but said the same rules could not apply if they were engaged in a ‘serious issue such as giving evidence’ as the veil could ‘undermine’ a trial. Today he received the backing of the Prime Minister, who said institutions should be able to 'set and enforce' rules on dress. Mr Clarke described the niqab, where only the woman’s eyes are visible, as a ‘most peculiar costume for the 21st century’ that left them ‘completely invisible’ to others. Mr Clarke’s comments are likely to reignite the row over the veil, which was highlighted when a judge asked a Muslim woman to remove her veil to give evidence in a trial scheduled to begin this month. At a plea hearing back in September, Judge Peter Murphy ruled that the 22-year-old woman – accused of intimidating a witness – would have to be seen by him, the jury and the lawyers if she was to give evidence. The woman will be allowed to keep her face covered for the rest of the proceedings. But the judge said it was ‘crucial’ that the jury could see the defendant ‘for the purposes of evaluating’ her statement. Veteran politician Mr Clarke, currently minister without portfolio, said: ‘I do think it’s a most peculiar costume for people to adopt in the 21st century. ‘But that’s not for me to decide when they’re not actually engaged in some serious issue such as giving evidence. That’s the bit which I think is almost impossible to have a proper trial if one of the persons is in a kind of bag.’ He added: ‘I was a barrister at the bar in criminal cases for about 15 years, and I don’t think a witness should be allowed to give evidence from behind a veil. The key thing a judge or a jury has to do is decide if someone is telling the truth. ‘The fact is we don’t know individually . how each of us decides whether we trust somebody or believe they’re . telling the truth when they tell us a story. It’s all because of body . language and expression and how they do it,' he told BBC Radio 4's World This Weekend. ‘I can’t see how on earth . a judge and a jury can really appraise the evidence when you’re facing . somebody who’s cloaked, and is completely invisible to you.’ Opinion: Mr Clarke described the wearing of the niqab (left), where only the woman's eyes are visible, as a 'most peculiar costume for the 21 century' that left them 'completely invisible' to others . And while he maintained that people . should be able to wear ‘what the devil they like in public,’ he went on . to say: ‘But giving evidence in a court of law on a serious issue of . guilt or innocence, I think the jury and the judge have got to be able . to see the face of the witness, judge their demeanour, and decide for . themselves whether they’re going to rely on this evidence. ‘Maybe . there’ll have to be some sort of screening from the general public but I . actually think it undermines a trial, and that’s not based on any trace . of Islamophobia on my part, I don’t have that at all.’ Downing Street said David Cameron agreed with Mr Clarke. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'There is an important issue around dress codes and uniform policies in a number of institutions and it is very important that those institutions should be able to set and enforce them. 'For example, schools that have uniform policies. There may be cases at borders where it may be important to ascertain someone's identity' Some people in Britain have called for the niqab to be banned in public as it is in France. There has also been heated debate over whether children should be compelled to wear it in school, where uniform policy is the responsibility of the head teacher. Farooq Murad, from the Muslim Council of Britain, told the BBC’s Sunday Politics he did not believe adopting the full-face veil was a ‘requirement’ of Islam – explaining that only a small minority of Muslim women choose to wear them. And Britain’s most senior Muslim politician, communities minister Baroness Warsi, said last week that a ban was ‘not the British way’ and called for a ‘common sense’ approach to the problem.","Former barrister believes women should wear what they wish in public .

A drug addict who was caught stealing money from a 98-year-old dementia sufferer has been jailed again after going on a spending spree with a pensioner's bank card. Kelly Bolam was jailed for 20 months last year after she was caught on hidden cameras stealing from dementia sufferer Edward Elliott after she had befriended him. Eight months later while out on licence she stole hundreds of pounds from a 76-year-old man. Kelly Bolam has been sentenced to 12 months in prison after she went on a spending spree with a pensioner's bank card . A court heard she went on a spending spree after getting hold of his bank card and pin number after befriending him. A judge at Newcastle Crown Court has branded the 34-year-old's offences as 'wicked and vile' and sent her back to prison for 12 months. Sentencing her for nine counts of fraud, Mr Recorder Singh told Bolam: 'I regard you as someone who deliberately targets vulnerable people. 'This is not the first time you have carried out this kind of confidence fraud by befriending someone who has either got dementia or, on the last occasion, was 98-years-old. 'On this occasion you again targeted a vulnerable elderly complainant. You don’t seem to have learned your lesson. These are wicked and vile offences committed on people with little money or income.' Bolam first made contact with the latest victim by approaching him in the street and asking if the pensioner wanted to buy an Xbox game. Bolam last year pleaded guilty to burglary and false representation after being caught on CCTV stealing from a 98-year-old dementia sufferer . The next day she went to his home in Newcastle, where he lives alone, and managed to get his bank card and pin number off him. Tim Gittins, prosecuting, said: 'She was then able, over the next few days, to use the card, both for his use and, more importantly, for her own purposes. She obtained goods and services and took out cash on a number of occasions.' By the end of her spending spree Bolam had deprived the pensioner of £560. Eventually the victim became suspicious and spoke to his friend, who persuaded him to go to the police. The court heard his bank refunded the cash withdrawls but not the £170 spent on goods. A judge at Newcastle Crown Court branded the 34-year-old's offences as 'wicked and vile' and sent her back to prison for 12 months . Bolam, also known as Sewell, formerly of Benwell, Newcastle, pleaded guilty to nine offences of fraud. Christopher Dorman-O’Gowan, defending, said: 'The facts speak for themselves and coupled with her antecedents they speak even louder. She has a drug problem although she tells me she’s off methadone and has been working as a cleaner and in a kitchen.' In the offences last year on the 98-year-old, it was reported Bolam pleaded guilty to burglary and false representation after being caught on CCTV. She had befriended dementia sufferer Edward Elliott, who lived alone and had no family to support him. Bolam was caught when police installed the hidden cameras at the victim’s home.","Kelly Bolam was jailed for 20 months last year after she was caught stealing .

Mitt Romney did not just have a problem with Chris Christie's obesity - he also was not above poking fun at heavyset women, it was revealed today. According to a new tell-all book about the 2012 presidential campaign, the trim former Massachusetts governor cared a great deal about fitness and naturally disliked those who did not. 'Oh, there’s your date for tonight,' he would jokingly tell his male staffers when they spotted a chunky woman on the street, Time Swampland reported. Scroll down for video . Fat-shaming: A new book about the 2012 campaign has revealed that Mitt Romney would make fun of overweight women on the street to his male aides . During the campaign, then-65-year-old Romney publicly said that he runs three miles every morning and works out on a stationary bike or elliptical machine. Last September, the Romney campaign released a letter from his physician praising him as a 'healthy appearing, energetic, strong, physically fit male.' The book, Double Down: Game Change 2012 by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, reveals Romney nixed Christie as a possible running mate because of potential 'landmines' in his health and background. He also mocked the governor over his size. 'Romney marveled at Christie's girth,' according to the book. 'Watching a video of Christie without his suit jacket on, Romney cackled to his aides ""guys! Look at that""'. Issues: A new book has revealed that Mitt Romney . (left) didn't ask Chris Christie (center) to be his candidate for vice . president in 2012 because of 'potential landmines' in his health and . background checks . Romney's search for a vice-presidential nominee was codenamed 'Project goldfish', but Christie was given the name 'Pufferfish'. The GOP presidential candidate, who values punctually, also was reportedly unhappy with Christie's tendency to arrive late for events. In response to the revelations, an aide to Christie said: 'Governor Christie complied fully with the Romney campaign’s request for documents in a timely manner, including a complete medical report from his internist and cardiologist.' Christie, who underwent lap band surgery in February to help him lose weight, recently released a report from his doctor that said he 'has no medical limitations and is fit to serve as the governor'. The book also reveals that President Obama's aides considered switching Joe Biden out for Hillary Clinton as his VP. The authors explain that Christie, who is widely seen as a top candidate among Republicans for 2016, left unanswered questions about a defamation lawsuit that was brought against him earlier in his career - putting off Romney further. Dropped: Romney, pictured with his wife Ann, re-considered Christie but ultimately decided to drop him . He also avoided information about a Securities and Exchange Commission settlement involving his brother, the names and documentation of his household help, details about his time as a securities industry lobbyist and on his medical history, the New York Times reported. 'The dossier on the Garden State governor’s background was littered with potential land mines,' the authors write. It led Romney to initially consider Christie before striking him off the list - then reconsider before eventually dropping him again. Revealed: The new details are shared in 'Double Down', which is out next week . Some of the other concerns were over Christie's defamation cases - he has both sued and been sued for defamation. In 1994, his Morris County freeholder primary opponents sued him for claiming they were under investigation by the county prosecutor, the New Jersey Star Ledger explained. The case was settled and Christie apologized. In 1997, Christie sued opponent John Murphy after losing his primary for re-election as a freeholder, but details of the outcome was never disclosed. In another book published earlier this year, Christie had branded the vetting forms 'intrusive', saying the Romney campaign expected him to complete 75 pages. 'Asked about stuff with your kids, and . issues with your children, obviously criminal record, mental health . issues drinking history, drug history,' he told Dan Balz for 'Collision . 2012'. 'All intrusive stuff.' Romney also didn't like the was he showed up late to campaign events, according to the Washington Post. But there seems to have been no love lost from Christie's side either. The book claims Christie concluded Romney's campaign team was a 'gaggle of clowns who couldn't organize a one-ring circus', according to the Post. When Christie came under fire for his RNC speech, claims the book, he confronted Ron Kaufman, a Romney aide, and screamed: 'I'm tired of you people!!! Leave me the f***k alone!!!!' Another major revelation in 'Double Down' is that Obama's top aides secretly . considered replacing Biden with then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton . and carried out focus group sessions and pollings to help them decide it . it were the right decision. The consideration was pushed by the chief . of staff at the time, William M. Daley, who explained that opinion of . Obama in 2011 was at an all time low. By his side: The book also revealed that Obama's aides considering dropping Joe Biden as his VP . Ruled out: But aides ultimately concluded that she would not give enough of a boost to justify the move . 'I was vocal about looking into a whole bunch of things, and this was one of them,' he said. 'You have to remember, at that point the president was in awful shape, so we were like, ""Holy Christ, what do we do?""' But the aides eventually dismissed the plan, concluding that, although Clinton was a popular candidate, it would not give a big enough boost to justify the radical move, the Times reported. The book also details Obama's opinion of Bill Clinton, saying that he found him exhausting and once told an aide: 'I like him... in doses.' But ultimately, it explains, Obama came to rely on Clinton as a counselor and immediately called him following Romney's concession call on election night.","Romney's aides concluded there were 'potential landmines' in New Jersey governor's health and background checks, a new book has revealed .

Vetting issues: A new book has revealed that Mitt Romney (left) didn't ask Chris Christie (center) to be his candidate for vice president in 2012 because of 'potential landmines' in his health and background checks . The shocking details leaked from 51-year-old Christie's vetting file are revealed in journalists Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's tell-all book, Double Down: Game Change 2012. The book claims Romney included Christie on his shortlist of five possible candidates, impressed by the governor's forthrightness and ability to connect with voters. However, 'controversies lurking in the shadows of his record' put Romney off and he scrapped him. 'The dossier on the Garden State governor’s background was littered with potential land mines,' the authors wrote, according to Swampland. Vetters were concerned after discovering a 2010 Department of Justice inspector general’s investigation of Christie’s spending patterns in his job prior to the governorship. The report criticized him for being 'the U.S. attorney who most often exceeded the government [travel expense] rate without adequate justification' and for offering 'insufficient, inaccurate, or no justification' for stays at lavish hotels. Tardy: It bothered Mitt Romney (left) that Chris Christie frequently showed up at Romney's fundraising events late . They were also concerned that Christie worked as a lobbyist on behalf of the . Securities Industry Association when Bernie Madoff was a . senior SIA official and sought an exemption from New Jersey’s Consumer . Fraud Act. Christie’s decision to steer hefty government . contracts to donors and political allies like former Attorney General . John Ashcroft, which sparked a congressional hearing, was considered a 'landmine'. The . authors also explained that Christie, who is widely seen as a top candidate . among Republicans for 2016, left unanswered questions about a defamation . lawsuit that was brought against him earlier in his career. The book also claimed Christie avoided information about a . Securities and Exchange Commission settlement involving his brother, Todd Christie, who acknowledged making 'hundreds of trades in which . customers had been systematically overcharged.' All of that was on top of a litany of glaring matters that concerned Romney and his team. These included Christie’s other lobbying clients, his . investments overseas, the YouTube clips which called into doubt his presidential temperament, his tardiness and his weight. The book claimed Romney, who once boasted about running three miles a day, often mocked the governor over his size. 'Romney marveled at Christie's . girth,' according to the book.

Derek Tubby, 60, threatened terrified staff at his local Barclays branch, pictured arriving at court . A businessman who threatened bank staff with a makeshift flamethrower after his debit card was cancelled has walked free from court. Shocked staff feared that Derek Tubby, 60, was about to set their building ablaze with his blowtorch and can of petrol after he stormed into the Barclays branch in Acle, near Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. Norwich Crown Court heard Tubby claimed he had been treated 'unfairly' by the bank after a failed business venture left him £100,000 in debt. The six staff and two customers in the bank fled through a back door before armed police surrounded the building on September 23. Grey-haired Tubby of Rollesby, near Great Yarmouth, was tasered and hit with a baton when officers burst in and found him still holding the green plastic petrol can and blowtorch. He admitted affray and was given a 12-month jail sentence suspended for 18 months and ordered to do 150 hours' unpaid work. Judge Mark Lucraft QC also imposed a restraining order banning him from going into any branch of Barclays. The judge told him: 'It is not, and cannot be right, to deal with anything in this way, whatever the grievance was.' Prosecutor Richard White said Tubby had shouted at staff in a 'raised and aggressive voice'. He added: 'He was saying that what the bank had done to him was criminal and said the bank had done it again and blocked his debit card.' The bank in Acle, Great Yarmouth, where Derek Tubby threatened staff with a makeshift flamethrower . The bank manager tried to calm Tubby down by promising to look into his complaints, but he remained agitated. The court heard how Tubby at first refused to allow the customers to leave as he wanted them to stay and hear what he had to say. A policeman carries the makeshift flamethrower in an evidence bag after the incident . Mr White said one of the bank staff felt sick at the shock of what had happened, but a customer in the bank at the time had said he did not think Tubby would carry out any threat. The court heard that Tubby received a caution in 2009 for going into a Barclays branch, in Lowestoft, Suffolk, with a crow bar and causing alarm. Andrew Oliver, defending, said that Tubby had overreacted after having a difficult past four years and no longer banked with Barclays. He tried to set up a children's nursery in Norwich for his daughter in 2009 but there was a problem over planning, . Tubby tried to get re-finance with the Alliance and Leicester bank, but found Barclays had taken power of attorney on his house and had his deeds to the property. When he tried to get the deeds back, there was a delay in finding them. Mr Oliver said: 'He had to pay £3,500 every three months for the rent of a building which was useless.' He said the situation got so bad that the business had to be closed, which left him with significant debts of nearly £100,000. The final straw came when his debit card was cancelled, causing him to fail to pay a VAT bill which made him liable for fines. Tubby said after the hearing: 'A fair hearing in court witnessed how Barclays Bank had sadly controlled my family life. 'I felt that the public deserved the right to know how I have been treated. Police at the scene: Bank staff said they thought that Mr Tubby would set the building on fire during the incident . 'This forced me to express my opinions in an out-of character manner in order to be heard. I would finally like to draw a line under the long lasting grievances.' A Barclays spokeswoman said the incident was 'a shock' for staff.","Derek Tubby terrified staff and customers with the makeshift device .

A huge fireball caused by lightning during a windstorm which left thousands of people without power narrowly missed a home by inches . Huw Griffiths captured the terrifying moment his home was nearly hit by a fireball in Lachine, Montreal, on Friday. Around 350,000 Hydro-Quebec customers lost power in total and 80,000 were still without power by 7pm on Friday. Patrice Lavoie, a spokesperson for Hydro-Quebec, told Global news that, ‘There’s only so much we can do when we have to fight against the elements. ‘ . Recovery teams must wait until the storm is over before they can go back into the area. ‘What gave the severe winds, the . damaging winds, was the rapidly rising pressure behind this intense . weather system front,’ said meteorologist Michael Elliot. Hyrdo-Quebec’s Twitter page has been announcing updates on the storm. ‘In . those cases, our teams have to go over there, remove branches from the . network, in some cases, we have also trees that have fallen on the . networks,’ said Lavoie. Ball lightning has been seen to float across land or through buildings and can even bounce down the aisles of aircraft. But its rarity has made it extremely hard to study and to understand.

New York Senator Chuck Schumer is the first prominent Democrat to publicly endorse Hillary Clinton as the next president of the United States. The party seems to be staging a unified stance behind Clinton as it was revealed earlier this week that all 16 female Democratic senators sent Clinton a letter earlier this year, urging her to run in 2016. '2016 is Hillary's time,' Senator Schumer said at a Democratic party dinner in Iowa yesterday. 'And our nation will be all the better for it.' Got her back: New York Senator Chuck Schumer made an early endorsement of Hillary Clinton as president yesterday at a party dinner in Iowa. Above, Clinton and Schumer in 2009 at her confirmation hearing for Secretary of State . An aide for Mr Schumer said the endorsement was not made at Clinton's request. 'Run, Hillary, run,' Mr Schumer said. 'If you run, you'll win and we'll all win. With a strong platform and with Hillary leading the charge, we will vanquish the Ted Cruz Tea Party Republicans in 2016.' Others are showing their early support for a Clinton ticket in a more private way. The potential candidate: Clinton spend Friday speaking at a women's conference in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania . Senator Kay Hagan, the Democratic senator from North Carolina, slipped up at an event in New York City last week when she revealed the existence of a secret letter she and all the other female Democratic senators signed earlier this year in support of Clinton. While the content of the letter has not been released, it appears to have been organized by Senator Barbara Boxer. Senator Boxer would not comment directly on the letter but told ABC News: 'I have repeatedly said - publicly, privately and in writing - that Hillary Clinton should run for president in 2016. I can only speak for myself. I'll leave it to my colleagues to describe their views.' Surprisingly, three of the women who signed the letter are rumored candidates themselves - Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. Friends or foes? One of the signers of the female senator's letter was Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts (right) who many are considering as a more liberal option for the 2016 ticket . After stepping down from her position as Secretary of State last January, Clinton at the time said she was 'not inclined' towards another presidential run. But lately she seems to be dropping more hints in favor of running and seems to be the most likely contender for the party ticket. While receiving an honorary degree at St Andrew's University in Scotland on September 13, Clinton said she hadn't made up her mind yet but was 'minded' to run.","New York Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer made an early endorsement of Hillary Clinton for president at a party dinner in Iowa .

He has studied the dictionary for up to ten hours a day to amass a vocabulary that would put the rest of us to shame. But teacher Paul Allan clinched the 42nd National Scrabble Championship yesterday using two  words that would not be out of place in his classroom. Mr Allan scored 46 points for 'ugh' and 'yeah' during a tense final against full-time Scrabble consultant Allan Simmons. Scroll down for video . Champion: Teacher Paul Allan, from Rushden in Northamptonshire, points to some key words used in his victory at the 42nd British National Scrabble Championships held in London yesterday . Tense match: Paul Allan, pictured left, competes against Allan Simmons, from Coldingham Village in the Scottish Borders, during the Scrabble final . The 43-year-old said his main concern during the match is strategy, not using impressive words. However, the finished board also included much more obscure words such as 'coniines' and 'bandura', a Ukrainian lute, which earned Mr Allan a score of 86 points - and the £2,500 prize. He was quoted by The Daily Telegraph as saying: 'The whole dictionary is there, and it is a rich dictionary. 'There are no good or bad words.' The final came down to the last match in the gruelling best-of-five showdown, but Mr Allan finished with a flurry and an overall score of 503 points to Mr Simmons’ 389. Afterwards, Mr Allan said: ‘I am . delighted to have won, especially given the fact that the final is . played to a public audience of players who expect to be impressed. Allan . played exceptionally well and was a delight to compete with.’ And it is not the first time Mr Allan, from Rushden, Northamptonshire, has savoured victory in the event. He was previously crowned champion in 2007 and has won a number of tournaments since starting to play Scrabble on a competitive level in 1993. How . the final board looked: Coniines, a poisonous alkaloid found in . hemlock, and Atigi, a coat worn by Canadian Inuits, were among the words . used in the Scrabble final . Heated exchange: Paul Allan and Allan Simmons compare notes during the final Scrabble match . Dedication: Mr Allan, pictured right, spends up to 10 hours a day studying the dictionary . Armed with a four-inch thick tome entitled The Collins Official Scrabble Dictionary, Mr Allan spends up to ten hours a day memorising words. The process started several years ago with the three- and four-letter words. Then came the five- and six- letter ones – and so on up to eight. ‘After that, it’s the law of diminishing returns,’ he explained. ‘You end up learning words which you will never ever have the chance to play. Asked if he ever bothers to learn what they all mean, Mr Allan replied: ‘Mostly – it helps me remember them.’ High scores: Mr Allan beat Mr Simmons' 389 final score with an overall score of 503 after playing his last word bandura for 86 points . Oops: Mr Simmons slaps his head as his opponent puts down his last word to win the final . And how often does the champion play? About 30,000 games in the past 20 years – an average of four games a day, 365 days a year. Away from the game, he enjoys athletics and juggling, although he will be brushing up on his words again in time for next month’s World championships in Prague. More than 150million Scrabble sets have been sold, according to Mattel, which owns the rights in most countries. It is estimated that some 30,000 games are started across in the world each hour.","Paul Allan clinched the title in the 42nd National .

"By . Jack Doyle, Home Affairs Correspondent . PUBLISHED: . 19:24 EST, 3 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:04 EST, 4 November 2013 . The Home Office confirmed plans for a £3,000 bond to prevent illegal immigrants from entering the country have been dropped after being vetoed by Nick Clegg . A plan for a £3,000 bond to deter illegal immigrants has been dropped, after it was vetoed by Nick Clegg, the Home Office confirmed last night. Under the proposals, temporary migrants from high-risk countries – such as Sri Lanka, Nigeria and Ghana – would have paid a surety before coming to Britain, and have it seized if they failed to leave when their visa expired. The proposal, a Tory manifesto commitment, was to be tested later this month. In a speech in March Mr Clegg tried to take credit for the idea but later disowned it. Backbench Tory MP Peter Bone said: ‘Nick Clegg has made it quite clear where the Lib Dems stand on immigration. 'This is yet another example of the problems of being in coalition with the Lib Dems who you cannot trust with anything they say. ‘Clearly this measure was going to make it more difficult for illegal . immigrants to come to the UK, and that has be vetoed by the Lib Dems. 'They want uncontrolled and unrestricted immigration.’ The scheme was expected to apply to visitors from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Ghana and Nigeria who would have paid up for a six-month visa. In March Mr Clegg appeared to back the policy in a speech in which he said there should be ‘zero tolerance’ of those who abuse the immigration system. But later this year he threatened to block the scheme if bonds were applied in an ‘indiscriminate way’. ‘I am absolutely not interested in a bond which becomes an indiscriminate way of clobbering people who want to come to this country, and in many respects bring great prosperity and benefits to this country, of course not.’ Business Secretary Vince Cable had suggested the policy could be used as a way of allowing in visitors who had been refused a visa. This stance was ridiculed by Home Secretary Theresa May in her Tory party conference speech. She said Mr Cable’s idea amounted to paying for ‘more immigrants to come here’. Home Secretary Theresa May ridiculed the Liberal Democrats' stance on immigration bonds at the Conservative party conference . She said: ‘Our drive to cut immigration has been so successful, even the Liberal Democrats are boasting about it in their campaign handbook. 'I don’t remember their enthusiasm for cutting immigration when we worked on the policies - so I’m going to take this with me next time they try to block our reforms. ‘Bonds were in our manifesto at the last election. But the Lib Dems suddenly announced that it was their idea. Then they said they were against them. ‘Then they said they were for them - but only to help more immigrants to come here. Now they say they’re against them after all. Labour MP Keith Vaz described the plans as 'unfair and discriminatory' 'They were for them, then they were against them... then they were for them, and now they’re against them.’ ‘Confused? Don’t be - the simple conclusion is you can only trust the Conservatives on immigration. Lib Dem sources said the policy was ‘not acceptable to the Liberal Democrats and was not supported by other government departments.’ One said: ‘We have been clear from the start that the version was just not acceptable to us.’ A Home Office spokesman said: ‘The Government has been considering whether we pilot a bond scheme that would deter people from overstaying the visa. We have decided not to proceed.’ Tory ministers are trying to cut net migration - the difference between the numbers arriving and those leaving - to below 100,000 by the time of the next general election. Labour MP Keith Vaz, the chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, described the scheme as ‘unfair and discriminatory’.","Plans for bond to deter illegal immigrants has been dropped .

The US espionage scandal shows no signs of letting up with Spanish media reporting that the NSA monitored tens of millions of phone calls in Spain between December 2012 and early 2013. The NSA allegedly gathered intelligence on 60 million phone calls made in Spain, which included callers’ numbers and locations, but not conversations. The reports' source was freshly leaked information from whistleblower Edward Snowden. Scroll down for video . Scandal: Spanish paper El Mundo's front page on Monday was dominated by the revelation that the NSA monitored phone calls made in Spain . The National Security Agency (NSA) headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland: The organisation has allegedly been spying on European leaders and Spanish phone calls . Unhappy: Mrs Merkel (pictured right, arriving for a summit) made stern remarks at the EU gathering which indicated she was not placated by talks with President Obama . The revelation followed claims that . U.S. President Barack Obama was personally informed of phone tapping . against German Chancellor Angela Merkel, which may have begun as early . as 2002, according to German media. Bild . am Sonntag newspaper quoted U.S. intelligence sources as saying that . National Security Agency chief Keith Alexander had briefed Obama on the . operation against Merkel in 2010. 'Obama did not halt the operation but rather let it continue,' the newspaper quoted a high-ranking NSA official as saying. News . weekly Der Spiegel reported that leaked NSA documents showed that . Merkel's phone had appeared on a list of spying targets since 2002, and . was still under surveillance weeks before Obama visited Berlin in June. As . a sense of betrayal spread in many world capitals allegedly targeted by . the NSA, European leaders are calling for a new deal with Washington on . intelligence gathering that would maintain an essential alliance while . keeping the fight against terrorism on track. Germany will send its own spy chiefs to Washington soon to demand answers. Antennas and suspected covered windows pictured on the roof of the U.S. embassy in Berlin: Bild and Spiegel described a hive of spy activity on the fourth floor of the building, a stone's throw from the government quarter . This image of the building, taken with a thermal imaging camera, highlights the suspected covered windows at the U.S embassy in Berlin . Covert: A general view of the U.S. embassy in Berlin, from which the NSA allegedly monitored Angela Merkel . Anger: German Chancellor Angela Merkel (left) and Brazil's Dilma Rousseff (right) have both voiced concerns over the NSA's infiltration of the online communications of foreigners . Meanwhile . several thousand protesters gathered in Washington Saturday to push for . new U.S. legislation to curb the NSA's activities. Swiss president Ueli Maurer warned that the scandal risked 'undermining confidence between states'. 'We . don't know if we're only seeing the tip of the iceberg or if other . governments are acting in the same ruthless manner,' he told the Schweiz . am Sonntag weekly. Merkel . confronted Obama with the snooping allegations in a phone call on . Wednesday saying that such spying would be a 'breach of trust' between . international partners. The suspicion also prompted Berlin to summon the U.S. ambassador - a highly unusual move between the close allies. The . Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung reported without citing its . sources that Obama had told Merkel during their call that he had been . unaware of any spying against her. Der Spiegel said he told her that if he had been informed of the operation he would have stopped it at once. Demands: Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta, . left, speaks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, right, yesterday during a . round-table meeting at an European Union summit in Brussels . Under fire: President Barack Obama, standing next to Vice President Joe Biden, speaks in the White House yesterday . German Chancellor Angela Merkel checking her mobile phone in May 2012 . Other . media reports said that Obama's National Security Advisor Susan Rice . had also told German officials the president knew nothing of the spying. Merkel's office declined to comment on what he told her during their conversation. The . White House has said it is not monitoring Merkel's phone calls and will . not do so in future, but it has refused to say whether it did . previously. Bild am Sonntag . said that Obama wanted to be informed in detail about Merkel, who has . played a decisive role in the eurozone debt crisis and is widely seen as . Europe's most powerful leader. As . a result, the report said, the NSA stepped up its surveillance of her . communications, targeting not only the mobile phone she uses to conduct . business for her conservative Christian Democratic Union party but also . her encrypted official device. Merkel only acquired the latter handset over the summer. Bild . said U.S. intelligence specialists were then able to monitor the . content of her conversations as well as text messages, which Merkel . sends by the dozen each day to key associates. Only . the specially secured land line in her office was out of the reach of . the NSA, which sent the intelligence gathered straight to the White . House bypassing the agency's headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland, . according to the report. Bild . and Spiegel described a hive of spy activity on the fourth floor of the . US embassy in central Berlin, a stone's throw from the government . quarter, from which the United States kept tabs on Merkel and other . German officials. Spiegel . cited a classified 2010 document indicating that U.S. intelligence had . 80 high-tech surveillance offices worldwide in cities including Paris, . Madrid, Rome, Prague, Geneva and Frankfurt. If . the spying against Merkel began in 2002, it would mean the United . States under then president George W. Bush targeted her while she was . still the country's chief opposition leader, three years before she . became chancellor. Bild said . Merkel's predecessor Gerhard Schroeder was also in the NSA's sights . because of his vocal opposition to the US invasion of Iraq and close . ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. As anger simmered in Berlin, Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich sharpened his tone. 'Surveillance is a crime and those responsible must be brought to justice,' he told Bild. A . poll for the newspaper found that 76 percent of Germans believe Obama . should apologise for the alleged spying on Merkel, and 60 percent said . the scandal had damaged German-U.S. ties. The scandal derived from documents acquired from Snowden by Spiegel. The Social Democrats' chief whip Thomas Oppermann told Bild that German MPs would now like to question Snowden. 'Snowden's accounts seem credible while the U.S. government apparently lied to us about this matter.' Last week Snowden hit back at claims by a U.S. government official that collating phone records is not ‘surveillance’. Statement: Snowden insisted that every phone call and internet transaction made in America is logged . Senator . Dianne Feinstein wrote in a newspaper recently that what the NSA is . gathering is not protected under the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits . unreasonable searches. She . wrote in USA Today on Sunday: ‘The call-records program is not . surveillance. It does not collect the content of any communication, nor . do the records include names or locations.’ She . added: ‘The NSA only collects the type of information found on a . telephone bill: phone numbers of calls placed and received, the time of . the calls and duration. The Supreme Court has held this ""metadata"" is . not protected under the Fourth Amendment.’ However . Snowden, although he didn’t name the lawmaker, clearly had her comments . in mind when he gave a statement to the American Civil Liberties Union . about phone tracking. He said: ‘In the last four months, we've learned a lot about our government. ‘We've . learned that the U.S. intelligence community secretly built a system of . pervasive surveillance. Today, no telephone in America makes a call . without leaving a record with the NSA. Today, no internet transaction . enters or leaves America without passing through the NSA's hands.

Before the treatment Ms Budhathoki said: 'More than myself, I'm worried about my children. They are mocked by their classmates.

Hypertrichosis means an abnormal amount of hair growth on the body.

It can be both congenital (present at birth), such as in the case of the Budhathoki family, or acquired later in life. Although there is no cure for congenital forms of hypertrichosis, it can be reduced through hair removal. Treatment may have adverse effects, however, causing scarring, dermatitis, or hypersensitivity. Several circus sideshow performers in the 19th and early 20th centuries, such as Julia Pastrana, had hypertrichosis. Many worked as 'freaks', including as 'bearded ladies' or as characters with animal traits such as 'Wolfman'.

Religious connection: The flame procession in Lewes has its roots in the 16th century. In previous years, 80,000 people have lined the streets to watch as many as 3,000 marchers brandishing torches . All ages: Young participants in the festivities, which also link to the infamous Guy Fawkes Gunpowder Plot against the Houses of Parliament in 1605 . Step back in time: The shops and buildings on the main streets of Lewes may have changed, but this is one annual tradition that holds strong . Showpiece: Crowds and marchers gathered around the Lewes war memorial to light crosses. An effigy of Guy Fawkes, who died in 1606 after an unsuccessful attempt to blow up Parliament, is also burnt . The procession, organised annually by six local societies, traces its roots to the 16th century and marks a tumultuous time in English history. A key part of the parade is seventeen flaming crosses, one for each of the Protestant martyrs burnt at the stake in the town between 1555 and 1557 as part of the Marian Prosecutions. The purge was initiated by the Roman Catholic monarch Queen Mary, who reigned between 1553 and 1558, and passed strict anti-Protestant legislation against anyone guilty of heresy against the Pope.

Spooky: Halloween may have been last week but there were still plenty of scary characters in the parade . At least three hundred were martyred in just five years - many meeting a fiery end on the stake and others hung, drawn and quartered. It is just a part of a number of parades and displays of pyrotechnics in the town - which can attract as many as 80,000 despite the place only having a population of 16,000. An effigy of Guy Fawkes, who died in 1606 a year after an unsuccessful plot to blow up the Houses of Parliament with Gunpowder. The Lewes event has previously courted controversy - in 2001, an effigy of Osama Bin Laden attracted national attention, as did the 2003 choice of a gypsy caravan. A fiery history: The seventeen flaming crosses in the parade represent the 17 martyrs who were burnt at the stake in Lewes as part of the Marian persecutions against Protestants in the reign of Mary I . History lesson: The Lewes Bonfire Night celebrations mark, in part, the Marian Persecutions of 1555-1557, a purge of Protestant religious reformers during the reign of Roman Catholic monarch Mary I. Heresy against the Catholic faith was punishable by death, with some burnt at the stake, as in Lewes, and other hung, drawn and quartered . While the flames remained alight in Lewes, others in the country saw their Bonfire Night pyrotechnics washed out by heavy rain. A number of fireworks displays were cancelled after heavy deluges of rain caused flash flooding in Dorset, Devon, Somerset and Wiltshire the worst affected. It follows the cancellation of a number of large displays over the weekend, including one in Newham, East London and in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire. In all, the Environment Agency issued seven flood warning in England and Wales on Monday morning, covering areas of the South-West, South-East, East Anglia, the Midlands and Wales.There were also 53 flood alerts in operation .In Carmarthenshire, nine adults and six children had to be rescued from a caravan park as flood waters rose on Sunday evening. The Mid and West Wales fire and rescue service used a boat as part of their operation at the Pendine Caravan Park. Flaming!

Dressed in vivid, blood-red costumes and brandishing burning torches, they are participating in an event which can trace its origins to the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 and the burning of 17 martyrs at the stake in the town in the period 1555-1557 . Clear message: Preparations in Lewes have been underway all weekend, with banners hung above the streets followed by the procession . Bournemouth saw the most rainfall in the UK, with 30mm falling in just 24 hours from 5pm on Saturday. The Dorset town would usually expect to receive 100mm of rain in the entire month of November.

'Getting poorer': Hikes in bills and travel costs are making it increasingly difficult for families to keep up (posed by model) The cost of living in Britain remains cripplingly high, with inflation currently five times greater than the average pay rise given to workers. The Office for National Statistics revealed the consumer prices index measure of inflation dropped from 3.5 per cent in March to three per cent in April. But the average pay rise is a paltry 0.6 per cent, far behind the high cost of living, which experts point out means ‘people are still getting poorer every month’. In a further blow, the long-awaited drop in inflation to its lowest rate for more than two years came because of largely superficial reasons. This year’s eye-watering hikes in household bills and overseas travel were not included in April’s inflation figures because Easter was much earlier this year than it was last year. For cash-strapped families, the pain remains, with almost all their bills continuing to rise far more quickly than the modest rise in their take-home pay. Every Easter, the cost of air fares and sea fares rockets to take advantage of people who want to go abroad for the holiday, such as parents with school-age children. The ONS said around half of the drop in last month’s inflation figure was caused by this year’s early Easter holiday. Economists said the drop in inflation was ‘distorted’ by the timing of the four-day holiday, with others saying it could just be ‘a statistical quirk.’ The bills nobody can avoid, such as food and heating, keep on rising. Over the past year, food prices have jumped by 4.2 per cent. Gas bills are 15.4 per cent higher than last year, while electricity bills are up 8.1 per cent. In April, the ONS said petrol prices reached a record of £1.42 per litre, up 3.2p per litre, and diesel prices also hit a new all-time high of £1.48 per litre, up 2.1p. The average family must spend an extra £1,035 if they want to maintain the same standard of living they enjoyed last year, according to the retirement income firm MGM Advantage. For many families, this is impossible, and they are having to make drastic cutbacks or eat into their savings to stay financially afloat. Brendan Barber, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said: ‘With earnings growing by just 0.6 per cent, people are still getting poorer every month.’ To make matters worse, economists predict inflation will not continue on its downward path. Andrew Goodwin, senior economic adviser to the accountant Ernst & Young’s Item Club, said: ‘These figures were heavily influenced by Easter being earlier this year, with the impact on air and sea fares reducing inflation by almost 0.3 percentage points. ‘But we would expect this to reverse next month.’ Last week, the Bank of England’s authoritative Inflation Report warned inflation will remain above the target set by the Government of two per cent for even longer. It said: ‘Inflation [is] likely to remain above the two per cent target for the next year or so.’ Saga, the old age experts, said inflation is hurting older people more than younger people. Since September 2007, the retail prices index measure of inflation has gone up by 16.6 per cent for the general population – but by 22.2 per cent for those aged 75 and above. This is because elderly people do not benefit from the drop in mortgage interest payments, unlike young people, but continue to spend their money on items which are going up, such as food.","Drop in inflation down to early Easter, say experts .

A District judge in New Mexico has tossed out a lawsuit attempting to permanently halt the slaughter of horses, potentially allowing for the resumption of equine meat as food in the United States. The lawsuit, filed by the animal protection group Humane Society, alleged that the Department of Agriculture had failed to carry out environmental reviews before giving approval to three separate companies to slaughter horses for human consumption. Horse meat cannot be sold as food in the United States, but it can be exported. The meat is sold for human consumption in China, Russia, Mexico and other countries and is sometimes used as feed for zoo animals. Nearly 159,000 horses were exported from the United States to Canada and Mexico during 2012, most likely for slaughter, officials said. The companies at the center of the lawsuit was Valley Meat Co. in Roswell, New Mexico, Responsible Transportation in Iowa and Rains Natural Meats in Missouri, reports NBC. On the menu? A U.S. District judge in New Mexico has rejected a lawsuit attempting to halt the slaughter of horses for human consumption . Plateful: Horse meat is exported for human consumption in China, Russia, Mexico and other countries and is sometimes used as feed for zoo animals . But in a 33-page ruling, Chief United States District Judge Christina Armijo concluded 'that the grants of inspection were properly issued'. She dismissed the lawsuit and denied a request for permanent injunction sought by the plaintiffs. Humane Society alleged that horses are being given medications not approved for livestock so the waste products of slaughterhouses may include pollutants. Following Armijo's ruling, their lawyers lodged a notice to appeal the ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. The Humane Society said in a statement it would 'not only appeal the decision, but also work with the states to block the plants from opening in Iowa, Missouri and New Mexico and step up its efforts in Congress to stop the slaughter of American horses'. Animal groups have argued for years about whether a ban on slaughter would save horses from an inhumane death or cause owners to abandon animals they no longer want or cannot afford to feed and treat for illness. Congress effectively banned horse slaughter in 2006 by saying the USDA could not spend any money to inspect the plants. Without USDA inspectors, slaughterhouses cannot operate. The ban had been extended a year at a time as part of USDA funding bills. Groups have argued for years about whether a ban on slaughter would save horses from an inhumane death or cause owners to abandon animals they no longer want or cannot afford to feed and treat for illness.","Lawsuit brought forward by animal protections group Humane Society and filed in New Mexico .

Cilla Black has dropped a reference to child beating from one of her famous songs, calling it ‘inappropriate’ for modern audiences. The former Blind Date host changed the line in Liverpool Lullaby during a performance  on a ‘family friendly’ ITV tribute show broadcast last week. Cilla, 70, who has been performing the number since the late 1960s, sang the altered version at the end of Wednesday’s The One And Only Cilla Black, celebrating her 50 years in showbusiness. Liverpool Lullaby is about a working-class mother struggling to bring up a child in the back streets of the city. The desperate mum warns her ‘mucky kid’ that unless he behaves, he will ‘gerra belt from your dad’ when he returns from a night in the pub. Out of fashion: Cilla in the 1960s when she sang the old words to Liverpool Lullaby and left, Cilla pictured almost 50 years later appearing on the Paul O'Grady last week . But in the version she sang on Wednesday, Liverpudlian Cilla replaced the line, which normally appears in three verses, with: ‘You’ll get told off by your dad.’ The change was thought necessary even though the 90-minute programme didn’t start until 9pm. The star’s agent and manager, her son Robert Willis, last night defended the new version, which he said was about ensuring the show stayed ‘family-friendly’. He said: ‘Cilla loves the song and she thought it was an evocative and appropriate ending for the show. We changed the line about belting because we thought it was important to bring the lyrics up to date. No one advocates people taking a belt to their children today, obviously.  It is just not appropriate. It may have been acceptable when the song first came out but it isn’t today.’ Cilla released the folk song as the B-side to her 1969 hit Conversations. But many fans, particularly in her native Liverpool, preferred the track to the A-side and the singer has embraced it ever since. A spokesman for ITV last night said the star and the broadcaster had agreed to amend the song. ‘Cilla felt some of the sentiment could have been made more relevant for today,’ he said. ‘She discussed it with everyone and there was a feeling it was the right way to go.’","Former Blind date host changed a line of the Liverpool Lullaby during a performance to make it more 'family friendly'

A group of gypsies have taken over a school car park by setting up camp while staff and pupils were away over half term. Parents at Cheslyn Hay Sport and Community High School in Staffordshire were warned the unexpected guests could be there for some time, as staff try to resolve the issue with local authorities. In a statement issued to parents, the school said it had worked with police and Staffordshire County Council to clear the site before the start of the school week but had been unsuccessful. Unexpected guests: Travelers who have set up camp on a car park belonging to the Cheslyn Hay Sport and Community High School in Staffordshire . Traffic chaos: Congestion built up around the school from 8am as parents struggled to find somewhere to park . They said: 'Currently, there is a group of travellers camped on the school coach park, who arrived sometime during Wednesday night. 'Despite the school being closed for half term, the site staff alerted the school's Business Director and Headteacher. 'During Thursday, both the county council and the police were informed of the issue. 'The school has done everything in its power to resolve the situation but it is the county council who own the land and it is their responsibility to take further action. Unmoved: Staff at the school believe the caravans may not be moved for some time, despite efforts by the local council and police . In the way: The school day finished earlier at 3pm to avoid pupils clashing with the travellers . 'Unfortunately, following calls to the council and the police it is now seems that the issue with the coach park will not be resolved in the immediate future.' The school brought the end of lessons forward to 3pm to avoid clashes with pupils leaving neighbouring Cheslyn Hay Primary School. Teachers from both the schools were posted outside to supervise pick-ups and drop-offs. They added: 'Staff from both schools will be on duty at the front of school. These procedures will be in place until further notice. 'Both schools continue to work closely with the police and council to resolve the situation and to reduce the impact on the local community.' Alternative means: Officials were forced to shut the school car park and sent school coaches to the neighbouring leisure centre car park instead . Staffordshire County Council said it would take court action if the travellers did not move on of their own accord. Mike Lawrence, Cabinet Member for Communities, Culture and Localism and local member for the area, said: 'The travellers have been asked to move from the two sites they are currently occupying at the car park of Cheslyn Hay School and on land at nearby Middle Hill. 'We do understand the concerns of residents particularly around parking at the school and would like to reassure parents that we are doing everything within our powers to resolve this issue swiftly. 'We are working with the police and in the meantime we are applying to the courts for a possession order to remove the travellers from the school car park and the nearby land, which is used as a bridleway, but hope they will leave the site without any further intervention from the courts or the police.'","Travellers set up camp at Cheslyn Hay Sport and Community High School in Staffordshire .

Every single member of the boyband One Direction are considered more influential in the UK than the Prime Minister, the Mayor of London and a number of other high-profile politicians and journalists, according to a new Twitter index. Liam Payne, Harry Styles, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson each scored 98 out of a possible 100 in terms of influence, with Zayn Malik in fifth place on 97. The scores are calculated based on how much other Twitter users retweet and engage with the tweeter and isn’t based purely on how many followers they have. Scroll down for the full Twitter 140 list . One Direction members (from left to right) Louis Tomlinson, Zayn Malik, Niall Horan, Harry Styles and Liam Payne are the top five most influential tweeters in the UK according to research from London-based media monitoring firm PeerIndex. Payne topped the list . Prime Minister David Cameron, for example, scored the same amount of points as Zayn Malik but has fewer than 500k followers, compared to the 3 million or more of Piers Morgan behind him in eighth place. The rest of the top 10 is made up of musician Ed Sheeran, columnist Caitlin Moran and comedian Ricky Gervais. PeerIndex studied over 10 billion tweets from 150 million people to compile the Twitter 140. For the ratings, Peerindex focused on whether other people in the UK were responding to, retweeting or engaging with a tweeter. 1 @real_liam_payne: Liam Payne (pictured) scored 98 and has 12.3 million followers . 2 @Harry_Styles: Harry Styles scored 98 and has 15.4 million followers . 3 @NiallOfficial: Niall Horan scored 98 and has 13.4 million followers . 4 @Louis_Tomlinson: Louis Tomlinson scored 98 and has 12.2 million followers . 5 @zaynmalik: Zayn Malik scored 97 and has 9.9 million followers . 6 @edsheeran: Ed Sheeran scored 97 and has 7.4 million followers . 7 @David_Cameron: David Cameron scored 97 and has 0.4 million followers . 8 @PiersMorgan: Piers Morgan scored 97 and has 3.6 million followers . 9 @caitlinmoran: Caitlin Moran scored 96 and has 0.4 million followers . 10 @rickygervais: Ricky Gervais scored 96 and has 4.9 million followers . Each tweeter was then assigned a UK π-score (Pi-score) from 1 to 100 using the a specially-created algorithm called PiQ. It then filtered out all tweeters based outside of the UK. All of the Top 140 have scores above 92 and the Uk π-score is an influence score in the context of the UK Twitter sphere. The research also assessed who the people engaging with an influencer were. For example, a retweet from someone highly influential is worth more than a retweet from an average Twitter user. Seventh place Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured, scored the same amount of points as One Direction's Zayn Malik (97) but has fewer than 500k followers, compared to Malik's 10.9 million . Presenter Piers Morgan, pictured left, scored 97 in the PeerIndex report and has 3.6 million followers - putting him in eighth place. Tenth place comedian Ricky Gervais, right, scored 96 has 4.9 million followers . Zayn Malik, pictured, was the only One Direction member not to score 98 out of 100. Malik was in fifth place with 97 . PeerIndex excluded corporate and brand accounts, such as newspapers as well as parody accounts. It also ruled out journalists from the main national newspapers because it plans to produce a separate journalist table in the future. A number of people on the list aren’t based in the UK but were included because they have a strong influence in Great Britain. These include Piers Morgan, as well as South African video blogger Caspar Lee and singer and entrepreneur will.i.am. The report is the third annual Twitter 140 list created by London-based PeerIndex. 'As Twitter has become more mainstream, the top 140 starts to resemble the contours of popular culture and power, the footballers, politicians and boy bands,' said PeerIndex founder Azeem Azhar. 'Twitter is so rich and vast, that subcultures co-exist on it, often without knowing about each other,' said Azhar. ""For example, even though more than 900, 000 people follow both George Osborne, the chancellor, and Rylan, the reality TV celebrity, they only share six followers in common.'","Payne, Harry Styles, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson scored 98 out of 100 .

Jailed: David Worrell, 30, of Burnley, Lancashire, downloaded and stored up to 25,000 indecent pictures of youngsters on his laptop . A pervert who used the word ‘paedo’ as his password for a library of child pornography has been jailed for four years. David Worrell, 30, of Burnley, Lancashire, downloaded and stored up to 25,000 indecent pictures of youngsters on his laptop computer after his unwitting girlfriend had gone to bed. Worrell - who viewed obscene pictures of girls aged three to 13 being abused - also distributed photos, by making them available to paedophiles in a file sharing website. He used internet chatrooms and claimed to have raped a five-year-old. In one conversation he talked about getting caught and said: ‘I know - Going to jail.’ Some of the offences occurred whilst Worrell was on bail after police had seized his computer equipment. At Burnley Crown Court, he admitted indecent images offences and was also ordered to sign the Sexual Offenders’ Register for life and was given a lifelong order allowing police to monitor his internet use. Stephen Parker, prosecuting, said last October police raided a house in Colne where at the time Worrell lived with his family. They seized a laptop computer and storage box. He was arrested, interviewed before the electrical equipment was analysed and owned up. Worrell said he had been downloading stuff for about a year and he ended up sharing images. He told officers: ‘I was stupid. I don’t know why.’ Sentencing: At Burnley Crown Court (file picture), he admitted indecent images offences and was also ordered to sign the Sexual Offenders' Register for life . He claimed he did not get sexual gratification and that it ‘knocked him sick’. Worrell added of his partner: ‘She will kill me. She’s probably going to kill me now.’ He was bailed but he acquired new computer equipment and police received intelligence about the distribution of indecent images and went to another house in Nelson, where he was living alone. Worrel was arrested, cautioned and replied: ‘I know there’s something wrong with me.’ A laptop, mobile phone and two USB drives were seized and more indecent images were found. Martin Hackett, defending, said: ‘These are truly awful offences of their type. He has lost everything. His partner has now ended the relationship. He has tried to make sense of why he committed these awful acts.’ 'I know there's something wrong with me' David Worrell . But, sentencing, Judge Beverley Lunt told Worrell: ‘There is clearly something very, very wrong with you, in that you are able to obtain sexual gratification from looking at and sharing images involving the rape and abuse of very young female children. Nothing, it seems, can stop you behaving in this way.’ Worrell admitted three counts of distributing an indecent image of a child ranging up to level five - the most serious to depict abuse. He admitted downloading 280 photos at level five, 1,500 pictures at level four, 1,500 images at level three, 353 at level two and 15,000 at level one. These offences took place at Colne, between June 2011 and last October. He also admitted a further five allegations of distributing an indecent image of a child - 10 images at level five, 314 images at level four, 114 pictures at level three, 156 pictures at level two and 3,920 images at level one. He further pleaded guilty to five counts of making an indecent photo of a child - one image at level five, 114 at level four, 22 at level three, 11 pictures at level two and 1,297 images at level one. These offences took place between last December and this July.","David Worrell, 30, viewed pictures of girls aged three to 13 being abused .

An artist has created a disgusting collection of work by making more than 50,000 flies vomit on his canvases. The revolting artwork is made by encouraging flies to throw-up sugar, water and watercolour paint. Artist John Knuth, 35, says he is taking advantage of flies’ digestive system to create the paintings – the largest of which measure up to 6ft tall and 4ft wide. This painting was created by John Knuth who makes up to 55,000 flies vomit on his various canvases . Mr Knuth takes advantage of the fact flies cannot chew. Instead, it must first regurgitate a mixture of saliva and partly-digested material onto what it is about to consume. This liquidises the food and leaves 'flyspeck' Fly vomit art is a revolting idea, but Mr Knuth is not the first to disgust audiences by using animals for his work. In 1995, Damien Hirst won a Turner Prize in 1995 with a rotting cow’s head. Chris Ofili has also profited from a gruesome idea, winning the prize in 1998 for a painting made with elephant dung. Meanwhile, even the faeces, urine and blood of humans has also been used to create art in the past. Perhaps most famously, singer Pete Doherty has in the past used his own blood to create a number of paintings. An exhibition of his work in 2008 featured a self-portrait, a gory illustration of his former girlfriend, Kate Moss, and one of his needles. ‘I grew up catching snakes and looking at Andy Warhol books,' he said. ‘As I developed as an artist, I became interested in how flies spread disease and how that could be used to create art. ‘I knew that the disease spread through their digestive system, but I wasn't sure how the biology worked. I found out more about it and discovered that during the process of eating, flies leave marks called 'flyspeck' which is essentially their vomit. ‘I started experimenting with different ways to make paintings with this fly vomit.’ Mr Knuth takes advantage of the fact flies cannot chew. Instead, before it can eat, the insect must first regurgitate a mixture of saliva and partly-digested material onto what it is about to consume. This liquidises the food, allowing the fly to suck it up, and leaving 'flyspeck' - a small splash of fly vomit. Mr Knuth's method is to mix sugared water with watercolours to ensure the flies regurgitate sugary paint onto his canvasses. Houseflies generally only live for a month and each painting can take up to three months to complete - meaning several generations of flies work on one canvas. The largest paintings, which are 6ft tall and 4ft wide, are created by populations of up to 55,000 flies. Houseflies generally live for a month, meaning the disgusting paintings are created by several generations . The paintings form a series entitled 'Made in Los Angeles' Mr Knuth said: ‘I buy maggots from a supplier - people usually buy maggots for fishing, or to feed their pets or for classroom experiments, but not me. ‘I make the canvases, then paint a background color to use as a base for the rest of the painting. ‘I stand two canvasses together, facing each other, and surround them with a screen. I then put maggots in the middle. The screen means that when they hatch, the flies can't get out. ‘Once the maggots have pupated and are starting to hatch into flies, I mix paint and sugar and water, and let the flies get to work.’ Mr Knuth, of Los Angeles, said the collection is representative of the city . He said: 'When I started I fed the flies McDonald's cheeseburgers and Taco Bell, and that turned my thoughts towards the paintings being a microcosm for Los Angeles' The largest paintings, which are 6ft tall and 4ft wide, are created by populations of up to 55,000 flies . The paintings, which form a series entitled 'Made in Los Angeles', were produced for a project by LA's prestigious Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA). A film of the series, shot by John Toba and Andy Featherston for the MOCAtv project, details the paintings which appear largely uniform from a distance but reveal amazing detail on closer inspection. Mr Knuth, of Los Angeles, said the collection is representative of the city. He said: ‘When I started I fed the flies McDonald's cheeseburgers and Taco Bell, and that turned my thoughts towards the paintings being a microcosm for Los Angeles. ‘As I worked with the flies more, I liked how I could get them to create something beyond their nature - that I could get these nasty animals to create something transcendent. ‘Flies are non-social insects, meaning they don't make a hive like bees or a colony like ants. I have condensed them into a tight space unnaturally for them to make the paintings. ‘I am interested in “base level alchemy” - taking something base or mundane like flies, and turning it into something transcendent.’ Mr Knuth's method is to mix sugared water with watercolours to ensure flies regurgitate sugary paint .","Artist John Knuth uses up to 55,000 flies for painting on the canvases .

Mr Blair, 60, is reported to have regularly chartered the top-of-the-range Bombardier Global Express private jet as he travels the world in his new roles as business consultant and public speaker, according to The Sunday Telegraph. The former Labour leader has been seen disembarking in Bangkok, Sardinia and New York state, and it has also been seen in Switzerland, Ukraine and Israel on dates which matched Mr Blair’s visits. The 19-seater plane has a distinctive black-and-gold livery and luxurious interior, including leather seats and walnut panelling. Industry insiders said the Global Express costs an estimated £7,000 for every hour it is in the air. It can fly for 13 hours non-stop and has a range of about 7,000 miles. The Bombardier website says: ‘It is the most luxurious, most accomplished business aircraft ever built, accommodating the desires of the most sophisticated and demanding traveller with no compromises.’ The former Prime Minister has been regularly renting the Bombardier Global Express for intercontinental flights . Mr Blair was photographed leaving the . Global Express jet in Sardinia in the Mediterranean on August 25. A day . later, he and the plane were spotted in the Adirondacks in upstate New . York 4,300 miles away – an eight-hour flight which would have cost about . £60,000. On September 2, he . gave a speech in Bangkok, and a plane-spotting forum noted the Global . Express was seen at the Thai capital’s international airport on . September 1 and 3. A plane-spotter observed:  ‘The Globex transported . God’s self-appointed representative on earth, HRH Tony Bliar, correction . Blair.’ A journey from London to Bangkok would cost an estimated . £90,000. Mr Blair has . previously attracted criticism for flying in planes lent to him by . tyrants. These include the former Libyan dictator Colonel Muammar . Gaddafi and Rwanda’s autocratic President Paul Kagame, who despite being . leader of one of the poorest countries in the world, has two £30miilion . Bombardier aircraft. The luxurious cabin of the Bombardier Global Express XRS business jet Tony Blair has been privately renting . When . he was in Downing Street, Mr Blair’s administration considered plans for . a prime ministerial jet dubbed Blair Force One – in homage to the US . president’s Air Force One – but the scheme was abandoned as too . expensive. He has amassed an . estimated £50million fortune since leaving office in 2007 through . lucrative business consultancy work, lecture tours and as an adviser to . governments in South America. His role as the West’s peace envoy in the Middle East is unpaid. The . plane Mr Blair has been using was built in 2006, registered with the . Civil Aviation Authority in 2008, and its owner is listed as Aravco Ltd, . a firm based at Farnborough Airport in Hampshire. The company refused . to comment. A spokesman for Mr Blair said: ‘Taxpayers do not foot any part of the bill.’ Over the years several jets have been used as the official Presidential jet, the current Boeing 747 was bought in 1990 by the then-President George H. W. Bush .","The 581mph Bombardier Global Express can seat up to 19 people .

C.S Rolls teamed up with Henry Royce to unveil the Rolls-Royce 10hp in 1904. Rolls, whose name is now synonymous with the aviation and automotive industries, died in 1910 at the age of 32.

The father of three suffers from a rare condition that causes him to collapse if he comes into contact with certain triggers. Glynn Parry suffers from an extremely rare condition that causes him to collapse if he comes into contact with certain triggers, such as his wife Carrie's perfume . Trigger: Mr Parry says his wife once wore Chanel No 5 and he collapsed just seconds later . Mr Parry, 36, said: ‘Some sufferers react to chocolate or cheese but one of my strangest and strongest triggers is Chanel No 5. ‘My wife wore it once and I immediately collapsed – I just went within a space of a few seconds. It was a very severe reaction. ‘It may seem like a joke, being . knocked out by a perfume, but it  is not fun. Obviously Chanel No  5 . contains a specific mix to  which I am very susceptible.’ Mr Parry . suffers from familial hemiplegic migraines, a genetic condition . affecting neurotransmitters  in the brain.

Mr Parry suffered his first attack when he was just 14 and they have worsened as he has got older. ‘If I’m lucky, I get a warning and see blurred lights and then self-preservation kicks in,’ he said. ‘I try to find a bench, a chair or a . bed to land on and lie down on, because I know I’ve got a matter of . minutes before I collapse. ‘It leaves me completely paralysed . down my left side and the attack can be so bad I can’t move a muscle, I . can’t even blink.’ Mr Parry has to stay away from direct sunlight, . temperature changes, chocolate, caffeine, alcohol and certain foods, and . said his 33-year-old wife has also been forced to avoid perfumes, . deodorants or strong-smelling soaps.

"By . Natalie Clarke . PUBLISHED: . 18:07 EST, 2 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:53 EST, 3 December 2012 . An interesting poser has been exercising the Reverend Sally Hitchiner over the past week. She has posted several tweets on her Twitter page — where she describes herself as an ‘Anglican priest, faith adviser, broadcaster... and finder of funny things’ — on the subject of ‘the theology of fashion’. She was so preoccupied by it that she even conducted a Facebook debate on the subject. So we shouldn’t be too surprised then, that this weekend, the 32-year-old Church of England vicar took her theological studies even further forward, posing for a fashion shoot for a Saturday broadsheet magazine under the headline: The Vicar Wears Prada. More Dior than Dibley: This weekend, Rev Hitchiner posed for a fashion shoot for a Saturday broadsheet magazine . In the main picture, Rev Hitchiner is reclining on a leather chair wearing a £480 black leather jacket by Frances Leon, a £505 Prada top and tight silver leather trousers by the Mother label that come in at just over £1,000. She also wears £535 leopard print Christian Louboutin heels, that rest on a leather stool. In one shot, a heavily kohled eye gazes sultrily at the camera beneath a £239 Andrew Wilkie leopard skin hat set at a flirtatious angle, covering her other eye. Her blood red lips pout above her sharply white dog collar. In another picture, the vicar poses in a £1,025 blue, back and cream Stella McCartney top, accessorised again with her dog collar. Another uber-trendy picture sees Rev Hitchiner in a £646 black skirt by Graham & Spencer, £209 Sandro top, £355 shiny blazer by The Kooples and £995 ankle boots — again by Louboutin. Few of her flock can afford to wear such clothes — though in fairness, Rev Hitchiner borrowed them for the shoot. On her modest vicar’s stipend, her label of choice is the fashionable but infinitely cheaper Top Shop. But Rev Hitchiner certainly enjoyed herself. ‘Wearing a dog collar in a fashion shoot was quite a powerful experience,’ she declared afterwards, in a game attempt to give her day of dressing up in designer gear some sort of theological perspective. The fashion shoot appears to be some sort of response to last month’s vote by the Church of England’s governing General Synod, which decided against allowing women to become bishops. After agreeing to ordain women priests back in 1994, it has taken until now for the vote for women bishops to take place. As a consequence of its failure, the schism between CoE  ‘traditionalists’ and ‘progressives’ is wider than ever. There is no need to spell out whose side Rev Hitchiner, who had been mooted as a future bishop, is on. After all, would a ‘traditionalist’ wear Louboutin leopard print heels? Work attire: Sally Hitchiner has held the post of co-ordinating Anglican Chaplain and inter-faith adviser at Brunel University in Uxbridge for the past six months . Exactly. It’s a look that hasn’t been . received quite so well by the Church’s more traditional followers. But . Rev Hitchiner believes she is not alone in the clergy in enjoying the . frivolities of fashion. Explaining . that many priests like to ‘accessorise’, she says: ‘Everything in life . has two sides. It’s not that the Church of England is perfect and that . twinsets and pearls are perfect. ‘It’s . not that some supposedly frivolous areas in life are not worthy enough . for God. The fashion industry is important. Obviously, Nietzsche said a . lot of things about God I don’t agree with, but there’s his theory that . beauty makes you good, that engaging with things that are beautiful is . an antidote to the ugly and the difficult. ‘Historically, . the arts have been honoured by the Church as a spiritual gift, and the . first spiritual gift mentioned in the Bible is craftsmanship.’ Indeed. The great cathedrals of Europe, the Renaissance painters, . Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel. The list is a long and fine one. Now to add to it we have Christian Louboutin’s leopard print heels and a Stella McCartney top. ‘I’m in awe of Stella McCartney,’ she says. ‘I think she’s got a gift from God, although I’m not sure she would agree with me.’ Woman of the cloth: A shot from Rev Sally Hitchiner's Facebook page . Rev . Hitchiner’s unusual clerical style is apparent, too, on her Twitter and . Facebook pages. For her Twitter page, she selected a photograph of . herself wearing a tiara-style hair clip. In one picture on Facebook, she . is winking at the camera. Confronted . by all this attention-seeking, one is duty bound to ask the question . Rev Hitchiner is presumably dying for us to ask: is this really fitting . behaviour for a woman of the cloth? She has her own theory on this: ‘There . is that perception that religion is in a box with everything . middle-aged and that everything else is in another box; or (as far as . the clergy goes) that God is interested only in middle-aged men. ‘But why shouldn’t a priest be interested in Prada? I dress in a way that reflects my personality.’ Last . Monday, Rev Hitchiner tweeted: ‘Thinking fashion theology: Jesus said . consider flowers if you’re stressed “how much more beautifully will God . clothe you”.’ But it would . be unfair to suggest that Rev Hitchiner became a priest simply because . she thought wearing a dog collar might make her look groovy.Her . parishioners say she is hard- working and committed, and as Rev . Hitchiner says on her Twitter profile: ‘She loves many things: God, . anthropology, The West Wing, good food with good friends, mostly God . though . . .’ For the past . six months, she has held the post of co-ordinating Anglican Chaplain and . inter-faith adviser at Brunel University in Uxbridge, West London. Before that she was the vicar at St John’s Church in West Ealing. When . she left last June, parishioners held a ‘Mad Hatters’ Tea Party’ in her . honour to say goodbye. So . what led Rev Hitchiner on the path to serving God — and the fashion . industry — as the Church of England’s most style-conscious vicar? By her own account, she was brought up in Toxteth, Liverpool, the eldest of three daughters born to middle-class Christian parents who hoped to make ‘a difference’ to the then troubled neighbourhood in a way they believed the Anglican Church had failed to do. Her mother was a midwife, her father worked in the civil engineering department of the local council, specialising in drainage systems. At the age of 12, Rev Hitchiner, who attended an all-girls’ private school in Liverpool, became interested in religion and began going to church. She read the Gospels. ‘I recognised aspects of me: I felt like I was looking at somebody else’s holiday snaps and looking at places that I had been.’ Precisely what she means by this is not entirely clear. A future topic, perhaps, for her Facebook page. Fingers crossed: Rev Hitchiner attended Church House on November 20 for the General Synod vote. She wore her favourite tiara clip and a leather jacket . After school, she  studied social . policy at York University, then spent three years working for a charity, . for which she became a chaplain working in boarding schools. It . was during this time that she decided to become a priest. She studied . theology at Oxford University and was ordained in 2009. As an ordinand . (a priest in training), she spent two months shadowing the future . Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, when he was a canon at Coventry . Cathedral. In response to a . rumour that Abi Johnston, curate in the BBC comedy series Rev, is based . on her, she says: ‘I hope not. She’s really obnoxious and annoying. And . whining.’ Rev Hitchiner . lives in West London and prefers to keep her private life private. It is . not known if she is in a relationship; she has no children: ‘I wouldn’t . be doing what I’m doing if I’d had children. And I’m very happy with . the way things are.’ Over . the past few months, Rev Hitchiner’s profile has grown as she has . appeared on various programmes on television to discuss the issue of . women bishops. During one interview on breakfast TV last month she wore . her pretty tiara clip in her hair. This prompted a response from one . internet blogger who might be said to represent the ‘traditionalists’ within the Church of England. ‘This . is the sort of spectacle traditional Anglicans feared when they allowed . the ordination of women,’ the blogger wrote. ‘We wouldn’t expect a . policewoman to accessorise her uniform like this — nor do her hair up . like she’s off to a ball. ‘She seems rather too vain  to hold offices which require quiet dignity.’ With . other female clergy, Rev Hitchiner attended Church House on November 20 . for the General Synod vote. Again, she wore her favourite tiara clip, a . leather jacket, black leather boots and a fashionable mustard- coloured . bag. Sadly, it wasn’t enough. The vote in favour of women bishops failed. Rev Hitchiner says she was ‘shocked’ and ‘sad’, but adds that the issue has become an ‘unstoppable train. It is bound to happen . . . As a feminist, I believe that women shouldn’t be held back from anything. Women have worked very hard, whether they’re religious or not, to make sure that is the case.’ However, she says she believes it would be unwise for the State to intervene: ‘I also think that if the Church is dictated to by society or the State, it ceases to be a church.’ Yesterday, it was business as usual for Rev Hitchiner. She gave a  sermon to mark the beginning of Advent at St John’s Church in  Central London, then returned in the evening for a carol service clad in traditional vestments and platform heels. One parishioner, 81-year-old Pamela Binns, was supportive of her. ‘Why shouldn’t she dress like that? She’s young and it might bring people into the church,’ she said. Fittingly, then, the theme of her sermon was hope and expectation, a traditional homily from the vicar who just happens to wear leopard print Louboutins.","Rev Sally Hitchiner posed in tight silver leather trousers worth over £1000 .

Famously reclusive heiress Huguette Clark’s mysterious Santa Barbara mansion could soon air its secrets as the city implements one of her last wishes and turns the cliffside home into a public center for the arts. Part of Clark’s hotly contested $300M will stipulates a foundation be created and named Bellosguardo, after the perfectly preserved Gilded Age mansion. Now a public eager to see what’s inside the breath-taking home may soon get its wish, so long as city officials can come up with $18 million IRS debt they’ve inherited with the estate. What's inside? The mysterious Huguette Clark's Santa Barbara mansion sat empty for years as the reclusive heiress lived out her final years in New York but could soon reveal its long held secrets . Frozen in the Gilded Age: The public may soon finally gets its peak inside Bellosguardo, a home owned by the reclusive heiress Huguette Clark and now by the city of Santa Barbara, California . Elusive: Clark died in 2011 and hadn't set in the cliffside mansion since the 50s, but kept it perfectly maintained throughout her life. Her hotly contested included the home as part of the creation of an arts non-profit . Clark, the daughter of a copper magnate, spent her final 20 years in a New York City hospital room, where she barely rarely spoke to family but was famous for her generosity to healthcare providers, financial advisors, attorneys, and other assistants. Her closest confidante was an immigrant nurse from the Philippines, to whom she left much of her wealth upon her death in 2011 at the age of 104. Eleven lawyers battled it out over the highly unusual will—including distant relatives, her goddaughter, her nurse Hadassah Peri and other people named in the will—till the bitter end, which finally came in September when they came to a satisfying agreement. Under the September 24 settlement, Clark's goddaughter Wanda Styka, gets $3.5 million. Another $34.5 million will be shared among nearly two dozen grandnieces and grandnephews or their children, many of whom said they had never met the reclusive heiress. The Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, DC. would get a gift of at least $10 million, and potentially more if the sale of Claude Monet's Water Lilies, a painting Clark owned, brings in more than $25 million. But Clark's celebrated but largely unseen mansion in Santa Barbara, California, was tapped to become the home of a charitable arts organization called the Bellosguardo Foundation, with a bequest of at least $4.5 million in cash, as well as assets in the property, valued at about $85 million, and its contents, worth about $6 million, according to figures from the New York State attorney general's office. Empty mansion: Bellosguardo was always impeccably maintained by Clark and even had perfectly kept gardens and a 1933 Cadillac limousine decades after the heiress had last stepped foot in the place . Bittersweet: Perched on the edge of the Pacific Ocean, Bellosguardo will now lend its name to that non-profit and serve as its 21, 666 square foot home so long as Santa Monica comes up with a way to resolve millions in IRS penalties the city also inherited . What a doll: Huguette, here with her copper baron father U.S. Senator William A. Clark in 1922, was famously reclusive and spent much of the end of her life in a New York City Hospital playing with her multi-million doll collection . Worth it? The gigantic estate has long been a staple of local Santa Barbara lore. Now the town is searching for a way to keep the mansion and open it up for public use but may have to sell the place to pay the IRS . At the time, Helene Schneider, the mayor of Santa Barbara, called the bequest ‘an amazing opportunity to create a magnificent organization that will significantly add to our strong artistic and cultural heritage.’ But now, reports the LA Times, the mystery-steeped mansion where fruit trees continue to be perfectly pruned and a 1933 Cadillac limousine sits in the driveway would act as the foundation’s public face may be forced onto the auction block. Schneider told the LA Times that, while the taxes themselves have been resolves, penalties for Clark’s delayed payments—amounting to $18 million—must still be paid. After the reclusive Clark died at 104, one will specified who among her family and confidantes would receive her vast wealth while another aimed to give all her money to the arts. An agreement split the difference in September . Strange: Clark also shelled out millions keeping up her apartment overlooking Central Park in Manhattan while she lived in a hospital. She did the same for a Connecticut estate she never even lived in . Huguette Clark, at about age four, sits with her doll collection on the porch of her father's mansion in Butte, Montana, in about 1910 . Believed to be a self-portrait, this unsigned painting shows Huguette Clark in her twenties. At a time when most women painted with pastels, Huguette was a serious art student, mixing her own oil paints . Begrudging heiress: Clark was the youngest child of U.S. Senator and copper magnate William A. Clark, whose money she said made it difficult for her to be happy . But the mayor, who is among the only people allowed inside the 21,666 square foot curiosity where Schneider says ‘you could eat off the floor’, remains confident her already culture-rich beach town will be further enriched by the generous gift. ‘The possibilities are endless,’ she said of the foundation, which Clark stipulated must ‘foster and promote the arts.’ Fascinating: Clark remained on the radar of an enthralled public despite going 80 years without being photographed. Her hotly contested will, and those it named, made for juicy tabloid fodder that reignited interest in the mysterious heiress . One of those possibility also happens to be the sale of the mansion, which would generate tens of millions. ‘Not so bad,’ Schneider told the LA Times. ‘But I really don't want to start there. It's a big question mark. And this thing is a big deal.’ The mansion wasn’t lived it for . decades leading up to Clark’s death, but she shelled out a fortune to . keep up it and her other homes while she languished in a hospital bed. She . also maintained in absentia what was her last residence on Manhattan’s . Fifth Avenue overlooking Central Park as well as Le Beau Château, in . wealthy New Canaan, Connecticut, though she never even lived there. Court . documents show that the enigmatic multi-millionaire spent $3.745 . million on the up-keep of 907 Fifth Avenue in the last 15 years of life. Famously, . Mrs Clark also kept her $3 million collection of dolls in her Upper . East Side homes. Under the final agreement, these were left to the . foundation as well. Miss . Clark was born in Paris in 1906, the youngest child of U.S. Senator . William Andrews Clark, who was known as one of the copper kings. He was America's second richest man in the early 1900s behind John D Rockefeller. He . shocked the political and financial world when he was 62 by announcing . he had secretly married two years earlier and that his 23-year-old wife . already had a two-year-old daughter. Miss . Clark became the subject of public fascination and an investigation . after a century of life as a recluse. The last photograph was taken of . her more than 80 years ago.# . Huguette designed and commissioned many tabletop reproductions of Japanese buildings: castles, tea rooms, houses, temples. ""She was just a delightful person,"" says Caterina Marsh, her go-between with the artists in Japan. ""She developed an incredible knowledge about the art and culture of Japan. It was astonishing what she knew, all the legends and folklore. To me, she was the last of an era."" On a summer visit to Butte in about 1917, W. A. Clark posed with daughters Andrée, left, and Huguette at Columbia Gardens, the dance pavilion and family park that he built for the people of Butte. The girls were about fifteen and eleven. W.A. loved to show off his flower gardens here, and Huguette remembered going on a tour inside one of his copper mines .","Huguette Clark spent her final years in New York City but kept the California jewel of her $300M estate is in immaculate condition .

One in five NHS staff say they have been bullied in the workplace - and managers are the worst offenders. Almost half said they have witnessed bullying within the NHS in the last six months, according to a new survey. Among the most common complains were being deliberately ignored and public humiliation by colleagues. Unhealthy environment: One in five NHS staff have been subjected to bullying by a colleague and 43 per cent have witnessed similar behaviour . Almost 3,000 NHS staff took part in the Durham University study, published in the online journal BMJ Open . One in five of respondents had been bullied by colleagues within the past six months, ranging from rarely to daily. Over 40 per cent had witnessed other staff being bullied at work, at least now and then, in the preceding six months, with one in 20 witnessing it weekly or daily. The respondents worked in secondary care, primary care and mental health NHS trusts and all types of staff were represented, but the largest proportion of respondents were drawn from support staff, trainee doctors and dentists, healthcare assistants and nurses caring for adults. Bad trust: Some of the most common complaints were colleagues withholding information on purpose or experiencing public humiliation . Only between 2.7 per cent and 14 per cent of staff reported bullying to someone in authority, with a disbelief it would help and a fear of being branded a trouble-maker among the reasons for not coming forward. The most common complaints were: . Professor Jan Illing, of the Centre for Medical Education Research at Durham University, who headed the study said other research has already shown that bullying was more prevalent in hierarchical organisations - like the NHS. She said the recent report into the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal found bullying had stopped members of staff from speaking out about poor practice. Previous research has also shown bullying needs to be tackled from the top, she said. ‘Trusts should look at policies and consider what they can do to reduce workplace bullying,’ she said. ‘There needs to be a commitment from the chief executive and once that is in place, things are likely to happen.’","Nearly half of NHS staff witnessed bullying and 20 per cent are victims .

Failing to report allegations of child sexual abuse should be made a criminal offence in Britain, the former director of public prosecutions said. Keir Starmer believes it is time to 'change the law' and said it should be 'mandatory' to report allegations in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. Speaking on BBC Panorama, Mr Starmer said: 'I think the time has come to change the law and close a gap that's been there for a very long time. I think there should be a mandatory reporting provision. Calling for change: The former director of public prosecutions Keir Starmer, pictured on BBC Panorama, has called for failing to report allegations of child sexual abuse to be made a criminal offence . 'The problem is if you haven't got a central provision requiring people to report, then all you can do is fall back on other provisions that aren't really designed for that purpose and that usually means they run into difficulties. 'What you really need is a clear, direct law that everybody understands.' Mr Starmer told the programme he has spent a lot of time thinking about how the criminal justice system could improve its response to child sexual abuse. 'I went to Washington to see how the specialist teams there deal with it,' he said. 'They do have a mandatory reporting scheme, a very straightforward, simple scheme and something like that I think could work in this country.' Abuse lawyer Liz Dux, of Slater & Gordon, who represent more than 70 of Jimmy Savile's victims says it's vital lessons are learned from the case. She said: 'The Savile scandal has prompted a welcome shift in attitude towards child abuse - but there is so much more that needs to be done to make sure evil like this can never prosper again. 'It is vital lessons are learnt and our clients are determined that something positive comes out of the terrible abuse they suffered.' Looking for clarity: Mr Starmer told the BBC programme that a new clear and direct law is needed . She added: 'Since the Savile scandal some steps have been taken to assist victims through the difficult process of reporting abuse and the criminal trial process - but now the Government needs to act in a more positive way to make sure the silence that surrounded Savile and allowed his horrific abuse to go unreported can never happen again. 'We are now calling on the Government to introduce legislation whereby those in regulated activities who have direct knowledge of abuse and fail to do the right thing and report it will face prosecution. 'This will better protect people in the future. We owe this reform to the victims of abuse who have been failed in the past but remain courageous enough to speak out now.' The Mandate Now coalition also called for the reporting of child abuse to become mandatory. Napac (National Association for People Abused in Childhood), The Survivors Trust, Respond, Survivors UK and Innocence in Danger are calling for mandatory reporting to be introduced in schools and similar institutions, where children are cared for in loco parentis. Scandal: The suggested law change comes a year after the Jimmy Savile revelations . Jonathan West, a Mandate Now campaigner, said: 'Time after time we hear that head teachers and other professionals have failed to act on reports and concerns, and little is ever done to address this very serious shortcoming. 'Staff also need legal protection from the recrimination which can so easily follow when a person takes the courageous step of reporting a concern.' However, the Government currently has no plans to change the law - with the Department for Education stating that mandatory reporting is 'not the answer'. A spokesman said: 'Guidance is already crystal clear that professionals should refer immediately to social care when they are concerned about a child. 'Other countries have tried mandatory reporting and there is no evidence to show that it is a better system for protecting children. 'In fact there is evidence to show it can make children less safe.'","Former DPP director Keir Starmer says it is time to 'change the law'

A young man who has spent almost a decade in prison for a brutal murder he insists he didn't commit, could be close to finally being freed. The only evidence that linked Ryan Ferguson . to the murder of a sports editor found strangled in his office car park . in Columbia, Missouri, was testimony from two witnesses who have since . recanted their statements under oath. But after nearly 10 years in a maximum security prison, the 28-year-old could finally be close to having his conviction quashed. Hope: Ryan Ferguson, pictured with his legal team at a recent appeal hearing, could soon be released . Appeal: Ryan Ferguson has always denied that he was involved in the murder of Kent Heitholt . If his most recent appeal is upheld Ferguson, who has consistently denied being involved in the death of Kent Heitholt, could be home in time for Thanksgiving. 'It's hard to have much hope, at this point, in the justice system based on what they've done,' he told Good Morning America. It is easy to understand his cautious optimism. Ferguson was just 21 when he was sentenced to 40 years for a murder his friend Chuck Erikson had . implicated him in, despite Erikson not remembering any details of the . night in question. Even after Erikson recanted his account, telling an appeals court he had lied under oath, Ferguson remained behind bars. 'It's . scary knowing that they're not looking for the truth, they're looking . for a conviction… I might never have a chance to get my life back . again,' he said. The latest step in his legal challenge came last month, when lawyers took his case to a Kansas City appeals court. Cautious: After spending ten years in jail for a crime he says he didn't commit, Ferguson finds it hard to be optimistic . Now . Ferguson, his father Bill and rest of the family who have campaigned tirelessly to have his . conviction overturned, are waiting to hear if the judges will grant him a . new trial. Victim: Sports editor Kent Heitholt was found strangled in his newspaper's car park . Chief Legal Analyst for ABC, Dan Abrams, said there would be no evidence to convict Ferguson is a retrial is ordered. A . bloody footprint and hair found at the crime scene did not match him, . and the witnesses whose testimony his conviction was based on, later . admitted they had lied under oath. After spending his adult life behind bars, Ferguson is just trying to stay positive. 'I'm . going be ready for whatever life throws at me because I've been . preparing for so long,' he said. 'I just … maintain positivity and hope . that one day I'll wake up and I'll get a good phone call.' He has constantly proclaimed his evidence, ever since Erikson told police they had been involved in the crime two years after . Columbia Daily Tribune sports editor Mr Heitholt was discovered . strangled to death by his own belt in the early hours of November 1, . 2001. Erikson told police the pair, who had been 17 at the time, had been drinking underage at a nearby bar and that he could not remember what happened on the night in question. After reading a newspaper article about the murder he became convinced he was involved, saying that a photo fit of a man seen near the scene looked like him. In his police interviews Erikson, who was a drug user, was unable to give details of the crime, wrongly stating that Mr Heitholt had been strangled by a shirt, or a bungee cord, before the detective questioning him tells Erikson it was a belt. Confess: A mug shot of Chuck Erikson, right, who said he was involved after seeing a photofit, right, in a paper . Memory loss: Chuck Erikson, who says he cannot remember the night of the murder, recently retracted his statement that Ryan Ferguson was involved . He claimed however, that he struck the editor once, before Ferguson strangled him. 'The . police threatened me to implicate Ferguson or else I would be solely . responsible for Heitholt’s death and be charged with first-degree murder . and possibly sentenced to death,' Erickson said in an affidavit. Despite fingerprints, a bloody footprint and other evidence found at the scene not matching Erikson or Ferguson, police arrested them. 'Everything is wrong about this case, . everything's wrong about it. It makes absolutely no sense,' Kathleen . Zellner, who is working of Ferguson's appeal, told the court. Ferguson stated to police that on the night Heitholt was killed, he and Erikson had gone to a bar and then he drove them home. When his latest appeal was denied, Ferguson told CBS: 'I just sat in this room by myself. And . just stared at the floor ... and it's frustrating because you don't know, . even with all the facts, if you'll ever get your life back.' The appeal last year centered around the two witnesses who had implicated Ferguson both admitting they lied. Tribute: Victim Kent Heitholt was the sports editor at the Columbia Daily Tribune and a father of two . Crime scene: The sports editor was leaving his office after 2am when he was strangled in the car park . Erikson, who is serving a . 25-year-sentence, is now saying that although he still has no memory of . the night in question, he believes he acted alone. Tribune janitor Jerry Trump, who said . he saw the young men at the scene, also later admitted under oath that . he had falsely identified them from a picture he was shown. In his police interview, Erikson said: 'I could just be fabricating it all and not know. This is after reading the newspaper article in October and this is kinda what I put together with what could've happened.' He went on to say: 'From there on I'm just presuming what happened. I'm making presumptions based on what I read in the newspaper.' According to the Columbia Daily Tribune, a key witness who was the last person to see the victim alive, was never thoroughly investigated. Fellow sportswriter Michael Boyd had left the office the same time as Heitholt, who was married with two children. He says that he drove off before Heitholt. Campaign: Ryan Ferguson, left, with his father Bill and sister, Kelly, who are trying to have him released . The 1991 blue Oldsmobile he was . driving that night was never searched, and he traded it shortly . afterwards. Police have never been able to trace it. A forensic pathologist, Dr Larry Blum, has examined evidence from the trial for Ms Zellner, CBS said. He claims that the tire tool Erikson said he used to beat his victim did not fit the injuries. He added that the struggle lasted between six to eight minutes, meaning Mr Boyd put himself at the scene very close to the time . the crime was reported. According to CBS Mr Boyd said he left the car park at about 2.20am, . only six minutes before 911 was called. Mr Boyd, who has always cooperated with investigators and denied having anything to do with the crime, told 48 Hours that he returned to . the car park later that night after hearing about the murder. 'I've . always felt that the system works,' Ms Zellner said, as she explained . her determination to have him freed. 'He is absolutely innocent. ...I . don't want to be part of a system that cannot recognize and correct an . error.' His family have . gone to great lengths to raise awareness about Ferguson's case, . including driving a car emblazoned with his picture across the U.S. Support: Bill Ferguson has constantly campaigned for his son's release and recently drove across the U.S. in a car featuring details of Ryan's case . On the Free Ryan Ferguson Facebook page, Ferguson sent a message from his cell saying how the support has helped him through his 'hellish experience'. 'The contrast between the freedom which the open road on a beautiful day offers and the mind numbing confinement of these claustrophobic concrete walls couldn't be more harsh,' he said, in reference to the road trip undertaken to promote his cause.

"By . Sean Poulter . UPDATED: . 02:31 EST, 5 October 2011 . A pub landlady has won a  landmark court case against the Premier League which could  bring more televised football to the public. Fed up with paying a huge subscription fee to Sky to show matches, Karen Murphy instead bought games through a Greek satellite broadcaster for a much cheaper price. The Premier League, which sold the right to broadcast games in this country exclusively to Sky and ESPN for  £1.8billion, took legal action claiming Mrs Murphy was in breach of copyright. She was fined £8,000 by a British court. Victory: Landlady Karen Murphy won her legal battle at the European Court of Justice against the Premier League over the screening of games in her pub using a 'foreign' television decoder . But yesterday a European court backed . Mrs Murphy and said the Premier League’s stance was ‘contrary to EU . law’ on the freedom of trade. It means Sky and ESPN cannot hold . pubs and fans to ransom with monthly subscription charges which are . often as high as £12,000 a year. Landlords could now be able to show . all 380 Premier League games a season by buying decoder cards and . subscriptions from TV companies based in other EU states for less than . £2,000 a year. Fighting for football: After seven months the European Court of Justice has upheld the advice that exclusive licensing is against EU law . The ruling does not offer much . benefit to viewers at home at present because of the high cost of buying . a suitable satellite system to pick up the foreign stations. Viewers would need a larger satellite . dish, which costs around £500, as well as the decoder box and card, . which could be a further £1,500. A typical Sky subscription in the UK is . £480. But market forces could see providers introducing cheaper systems to tap into the legal breakthrough. The decision by the European Court of . Justice in Luxembourg could cost Sky more than £200million a year. The . Premier League’s income from selling the TV rights to games could also . be savaged, taking money from clubs and their multi-millionaire players. Mrs Murphy, who runs The Red White . and Blue pub in Portsmouth, initially clashed with Sky in 2005 when she . was being charged £700 a month – £8,400 a year. She found it was possible to make . huge savings – and get 3pm Saturday kick-offs, which are not shown on . Sky – by buying the matches via a Greek broadcaster for only £800 a . year. This involved installing a TV satellite system and buying a . decoder card from the Nova channel to unscramble the signals. One reason the Premier League and Sky . refuse to show matches at 3pm on a Saturday is to encourage fans to . attend matches rather than sitting in the pub or at home. However, the judgment concluded: ‘The . Court of Justice holds that national legislation which prohibits the . import, sale or use of foreign decoder cards is contrary to the freedom . to provide services and cannot be justified either in light of the . objective of protecting intellectual property rights or by the objective . of encouraging the public to attend football stadiums.’ Victory: Pub landlady Karen Murphy (pictured), who runs a pub in Portsmouth, has won a legal battle at the European Court of Justice against the Premier League over screening games in her pub using a 'foreign' television decoder . The ruling could make it cheaper for pubs to show matches such as Sunday's clash between Tottenham and Arsenal . The ruling will now go back to the . British High Court for final ratification. Mrs Murphy said: ‘If you as a . man on the street wanted to buy a car you could go to any garage and . buy one. As a publican I could only go to a Sky garage and pay ten times . what you would expect to pay. ‘I fought this because I was angry. I . fought because it was an unjust thing and I don’t believe these . corporate people should dictate how much I should pay for a system. ‘I’m thrilled. It’s taken quite a chunk of my life but I’m glad I took it on. It’s been like Karen versus Goliath.’ The British Beer & Pub . Association welcomed the ruling, saying: ‘Perhaps now, football will . become more affordable for pubs, as live sport is a key ingredient of a . great pub for millions of customers.’ The Premier League said it would need time to study the judgment. Mrs Murphy is free to use her decoder to show football at The Red, White & Blue pub in Portsmouth .","European Court ruling in favour of pub landlady could force Premier League to rethink its TV deals with Sky and ESPN .

Police have called on the help of psychics to help find a mute autistic boy who has been missing for a week. Avonte Oquendo, 14, went missing from the Center Boulevard School in Long Island City in the Queens borough of New York City last Friday. According to reports, more than one clairvoyant is working to find the teen, who has a mental age of about seven and can't verbally communicate. Missing: Avonte Oquendo was last seen on a school surveillance video leaving the Center Boulevard School in Long Island City, Queens around 12:45pm last Friday . 'All leads are investigated when it involves missing children and some of those leads come from speaking to psychics,' a source told the New York Daily News. One psychic tip sent police to a subway tunnel near Tompkins Square Park, but they found no sign of Avonte Oquendo. Hope: The Oquendo family are still hopeful that the missing teen will show up . Police are paying special attention to trains, subway tunnels and train yards, because the non-verbal teen has a fascination with railways. The Oquendo family is furious that the boy was allowed to leave the school by himself. Surveillance footage taken at 12:40pm last Friday shows Avonte Oquendo running through the school corridors towards the doors. More footage outside the school shows him walking away by himself. The Oquendos have filed a claim to sue the city and the school district for failing to supervise Avonte. 'We only get a few hours of sleep . every day, our mom can't stop crying, we can't eat,' Danny Oquendo, . Avonte's older brother, told HuffPost. The teen’s mother Vanessa Fontaine spoke about her hopes for her son yesterday to NBC. 'I’m . just hoping he’s okay. He finds some shelter from the rain. He’s not . sick. He’s not passed out from not eating. It’s been days and days and . days,' Fontaine said. She said she can't watch the security footage of her son leaving the school. 'I can’t watch it. I can’t see him run off like that and nobody’s running behind him to say, ""Hey kid, come back here."" There’s no one,' Fontaine said.According to the boy's grandmother Doris McCoy, a security guard questioned Avonte about where he was going as he made his way out of the school on Friday. Runaway: CCTV footage shows Avonte Oquendo running through the corridors of his school towards the entrance . Escape: Once he got outside, Avonte Oquendo ran down the street out of sight and hasn't been seen since . When he didn't respond, she allowed him to leave without any further inquiry. The family's attorney, David Perecman also said it took the school too long to notify the boy’s mother about his disappearance. 'The school had ordered a lockdown and was looking for the child in the school for an hour before they even let mom know,' he said. Perecman told the New York Daily News that the teen may have been able to slip out of school while 'a fight in the cafeteria distracted adults supervising him.' Clues: Police have followed up many leads, including a psychic's tip about Tompkins Square Park, but none have turned up any sign of the mute teen yet . Thanks to an anonymous donation, autism advocacy organization Autism Speaks is now offering a $50,000 reward for information that leads to Avonte being found. A candlelit vigil will be held Friday night outside of Avonte Oquendo's Long Island City school. Avonte Oquendo is described as being five-feet three-inches tall and weighing 125lb with short black hair and brown eyes.

Thinking on her feet, she used the stacks of train tickets she had accumulated during her daily commute to make them a picture. Nina said: 'I made them a map of the United States. My host family liked it so much they kind of motivated me to go on. 'I get inspired just by walking the streets of New York, there's so much inspiration all over the city.' Hollywood heroes: Audrey Hepburn and James Dean feature on this stunning black-and-white mosaics created entirely from used MetroCards . Each piece is painstakingly produced by cutting the cards into tiny pieces, glueing them to acetate and then glazing it in glue so it stays solid.

"Roy Keane snubbed Ryan Giggs in his best Manchester United team, saying: 'a great career doesn't mean you're a great player' Gary Neville, who Keane called United's 'weak link', would only make the bench .

David Beckham, but not Ryan Giggs, made it into Roy Keane’s Manchester United XI because he ‘challenged’ Sir Alex Ferguson - and not just as a result of marrying a Spice Girl. The former England captain had well-known disputes with his manager, notably about the company he was keeping, before moving to Real Madrid in 2003 and makes an all-star cast - almost all of whom had their differences with Ferguson. Keane, talking in an ITV documentary with Patrick Vieira, had Ruud van Nistelrooy and Eric Cantona leading the line, with no room for Gary Neville - pipped to a right-back slot by Paul Parker. There were also slots for Jaap Stam, Paul Ince and Cristiano Ronaldo. VIDEO  Scroll down to see Keane and Viera at loggerheads over battles at Old Trafford . Stand up: Roy Keane picked his Old Trafford dream team, most of whom had a fiery temper . Shunned: Keane omitted Paul Scholes (left) and Ryan Giggs (right) from his all-time XI, both of whom didn't stand up to Sir Alex Ferguson . Hairdryer moment: David Beckham was included as he was the 'better player' ‘You know you don’t win league titles by having choir boys in your dressing room,’ Keane said. ‘These boys did challenge the manager in different ways. Becks challenged the manager, but because you marry a certain woman doesn’t mean you’re challenging the manager. Far from it. ‘I think the manager’s got to understand that we’ve got different personalities in our dressing room but maybe that’s why we are winning trophies.’ Giggs was excluded to make room for Ronaldo, with Keane reasoning: ‘Having a great career doesn’t mean you’re a great player, I think there is a big difference. ‘I’m not saying Giggsy wasn’t... do I leave Ronaldo out?

Interestingly, Vieira claims that Ashley Cole was a ready-made Arsenal captain had he not left for Chelsea in 2006. Talking about when Cole moved to Stamford Bridge, Vieira said: ‘I was quite surprised to be honest. I tried to fight it a little bit because I wanted him to stay. ‘Ashley was supposed to be the next Arsenal captain because he was a player from the youth, grew up to the club and to let him go and see him go was disappointing.’ Surprised: Patrick Vieira (left) wanted Ashley Cole (right) to be Arsenal captain before his Chelsea move .

The pair then had to create a dream team made up of the two squads, with the main bone of contention coming at left-back. Keane fought hard for Denis Irwin’s inclusion while his rival argued the case of Cole. Amusingly they couldn’t agree. ‘You’d have Denis Irwin in there every day of the week,’ Keane said bullishly. ‘No,’ was the straight reply. ‘Ashley is...’ Vieira started before being cut off. ‘Never heard any off the field stuff (with Irwin),’ smiled Keane. Eventually both players were named. Meeting minds: Roy Keane (right) and Patrick Vieira came together for an ITV documentary . Beckham was omitted from that side after Vieira insisted on Pires coming in on the right-hand side. ‘Pires over Becks?

The deal was done between the two clubs so when it was time for me to leave I changed my mind because I believed that I wanted to stay at Arsenal, I wanted to finish my career at Arsenal. ‘I didn’t see any reason to leave, I don’t know if it was lack of courage to go. If I knew I was leaving the year after  I was going to Madrid. Keane added: ‘When my contract ran down on a couple of occasions I spoke to a couple of clubs, Bayern Munich, Juventus. I was very tempted I have to say but like yourself there was a bit of fear. ‘Contracts were agreed but I just never felt strong and want to go for it because I was very happy at United.’ Roy Keane and Patrick Vieira were talking in a documentary titled: Keane and Vieira - Best of Enemies, ITV4 10pm Tuesday.","Roy Keane snubbed Ryan Giggs in his best Manchester United team, saying: 'a great career doesn't mean you're a great player'

"By . Stephen Wright . PUBLISHED: . 18:40 EST, 24 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:55 EST, 24 November 2013 . 'Trust and confidence': Sir John Stevens will call for new media guidelines for relations between press and police . Relations between police and the media must ‘encourage, not restrict, two-way openness and contact’ so journalists can hold officers and their forces to account, a former head of Scotland Yard will say today. In what will be interpreted as a critique of a section of the Leveson report into Press standards, Lord Stevens will call for new media guidelines within forces which ‘re-build trust and confidence’. He is also expected to call for ‘streamlined and minimal requirements’ which do not restrict contact between officers and reporters. Lord Stevens, who served as Metropolitan Police Commissioner between 2000 and 2005, will make a powerful intervention on police/media relations in a major report on policing to be published today. The report by the Independent Commission on the Future of Policing – headed by Lord Stevens – will make uncomfortable reading for current Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe who has clamped down on unofficial contact between journalists and police officers and staff. It will also be perceived as a thinly-veiled attack on a section of Lord Justice Leveson’s report into Press standards last year which controversially touched upon relations between police and the Press. It is also likely to be seen as a riposte to former Parliamentary Standards Commissioner Elizabeth Filkin, who last year published a controversial report calling for even stricter controls on the way police officers interact with journalists. It was adopted by Scotland Yard which warned officers against ‘drinking’, ‘flirting’ or ‘carousing’ with reporters and told them to keep a note of any contacts. But critics say the ‘blunt instrument’ approach to police/media relations is counter-productive and could allow scandals in the force to be covered up. They argue it prevents newspapers such as the Daily Mail exposing failings in the Stephen Lawrence case and revealing the corrupt practices of the now disgraced ex-Met Commander, Ali Dizaei. In her report, Ms Filkin said the  ‘close relationship’ between parts of Scotland Yard and the media had caused ‘serious harm’. Sir Bernard – who prior to the hacking scandal was regarded by many journalists as a ‘very media-friendly police chief’ – said new rules for officers about relationships with journalists would be implemented. Critics say Ms Filkin’s report, and that of Lord Justice Leveson, have had a ‘chilling effect’ on police openness with the media. Criticism: Lord Justice Leveson, pictured with his report into Press standards published last yea. It discussed relations between police and the Press . Last year’s Leveson report called for a clampdown on police/media relations, with a record kept of meetings with senior officers and tighter curbs on briefings with reporters. It also warned police whistleblowers against going to journalists and advised officers to seek other ‘confidential avenues in which they may have faith’, such as the Independent Police Complaints Commission. Lord Justice Leveson wrote: ‘There remains an important point of principle which I need to come back to: that information which is confidential should remain so, unless there really are exceptional circumstances justifying the placing of that information into the public domain. Additionally, and looking at this more widely, the ends do not usually, or at least necessarily, justify the means.’ His report also said the term ‘off the record briefing’ should be scrapped. Instead, there should be ‘non-reportable briefing’, to inform reporters about things which cannot be used in reports, and an ‘embargoed briefing’ when reporting of the content is delayed. Clamp-down: Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe wants unofficial meetings between police and press to stop . He did not recommend a blanket ban on officers chatting with reporters over drinks, but said the dangers should be set out by police chiefs. But critics say the Leveson proposals have had a ‘freezing effect’ on police/media relations, meaning it is extremely difficult to hold forces to account on major stories already in the public domain – or scandals which have yet to be exposed. Shortly after taking over as Met chief, Lord Stevens – then Sir John Stevens – said he wanted his officers and staff to engage fully with the media. But in his wide-ranging report today – which was commissioned by the Labour Party – Lord Stevens will address the breakdown in relations between officers and journalists in the aftermath of the hacking scandal and the Leveson inquiry. He is expected to say the current policy of ‘not engaging with the media’ could cause ‘serious problems with ensuring public confidence’. It is understood that during his inquiry Lord Stevens and his high-powered team of ex police and security services’ chiefs, as well as senior politicians and academics, were told by interviewees that the police ‘need the media as much as media need police’. Lord Stevens, who after leaving the Met was briefly a columnist at the News of the World, was also told the Filkin report has failed because its foundation ‘relied on too many anecdotes and misunderstanding and not on hard or reliable evidence’. Last night the Police Federation of England and Wales welcomed Lord Stevens’s call for an improved media strategy.","Lord Stevens calls for new media guidelines to rebuild 'trust and confidence'

"PUBLISHED: . 02:47 EST, 23 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:54 EST, 23 May 2012 . Killer: Vince Li, pictured on his way to court in 2008, dismembered Tim McLean as screaming passengers fled from the bus . A Chinese immigrant who beheaded and cannibalised a fellow passenger on a Greyhound bus thought he was on a mission from God to kill an alien, according to a mental health worker who interviewed him. In 2009, Vince Li was found not criminally responsible due to mental illness for the death of Tim McLean, a 22-year-old carnival worker who was sitting next to him as they travelled near Portage la Prairie, in Manitoba, western Canada. Mr McLean had his eyes closed and was listening to music on his headphones when Li suddenly stood up, pulled out a knife and started stabbing him. As the bus stopped and horrified passengers fled, Li carved up Mr McLean's body, ate portions of it and displayed the victim's head to passengers outside the bus. After the judge's ruling, Li was placed in a locked wing of the Selkirk Mental Health Centre, Manitoba. Initially, he was not allowed outside, but over the years he has gained more freedom. Last week, a Criminal Code review board decided to let him go on escorted trips off the hospital grounds and into the nearby city of Selkirk. The ruling sparked renewed outrage from some members of the public, prompting Chris Summerville, head of the Manitoba Schizophrenia Society, to conduct a 45-minute interview with Li last weekend in the hope of shedding light on his progress. Mr Summerville has met with Li roughly every two months over the last four years. '(Li feels) remorse, a degree of humility - I know a lot of people won't believe that - regret and a sense of torment,' Mr Summerville said yesterday. 'He understands now that schizophrenia is a mental illness which plays tricks on the brain. He knows that the medication works to keep the voices away.' Grisly: Tim McLean (left) was 22 when he was stabbed and hacked apart while travelling across the Canadian Prairies. His killer had been sitting next to him on the bus, pictured as a police officer gathers evidence (right) Mr Summerville released an edited transcript of the interview to the media yesterday, in which he and Li discuss the night of July 30, 2008, when Li sat next to Mr McLean on a bus that was traveling on a desolate stretch of the TransCanada Highway bound for Winnipeg. Thirty-seven passengers were on board. 'He was on the lookout for aliens as such, and the voice of God told him that Tim McLean was an alien and he needed to destroy him lest Tim destroy other people,' Mr Summerville said. According to Summerville's transcript, Li recognises that people fear him. 'I understand people are scared because of my behaviour on the Greyhound bus. I am not at risk for anybody. I don't believe in aliens. I don't hear voices,' Mr Summerville quoted Li as saying. 'I take my medication... every day. I am glad to take it. I don't have any weird voices any more.' Roadside horror: A police officer photographs the bus around 12 miles west of Portage la Prairie, the day after the killing on July 30, 2008 . Li also told Mr Summerville he would like to be forgiven. 'I would do anything for (Mr McLean's) family. I would ask forgiveness, but I know it would be hard to accept,' Mr Summerville quoted Li as saying. But that forgiveness may be a tall order. Carol DeDelley, Mr McLean's mother, said: 'I think for the advancement of my own being ... my own soul, I will have to come to a place of accepting. 'But what would be unforgivable for me would be ... to not do anything to try to prevent this from happening again by the same perpetrator. I don't think Vince Li can be trusted to take his medication.' The victim's mother wants Li kept in a mental hospital permanently, but expects that he will gain more freedom every year until he is eventually released. 'If he's not responsible for his own behavior, then the state, the government, must step in and be responsible for him for the rest of (his) natural life.' Li emigrated to Canada from China in 2001 and became a Canadian citizen four years later. Secure: Selkirk Mental Health Centre, Manitoba, where Li has been locked up since he was ruled to be not criminally responsible for the attack due to mental illness .",Interview with Vince Li follows decision to let him out for day trips near the Canadian mental hospital where he has been locked up since 2009 .

Houston coach Gary Kubiak suffered a ‘mini-stroke’ when he collapsed while leaving the field at halftime of the Texans' game against Indianapolis on Sunday night. Kubiak was rushed to hospital and spent Monday undergoing a battery of tests which concluded that he had suffered a Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA), often referred to as a ‘mini-stroke.’ TIAs don’t generally cause permanent brain damage or loss of motor function, but they are considered a serious warning sign and about a third of people go on to suffer a stroke within a year. Scroll down for video . Houston coach Gary Kubiak suffered a 'mini-stroke' when he collapsed while leaving the field at halftime of the Texans' game against Indianapolis on Sunday night . It remains unclear how long Kubiak, 52, will be away from the team, but he is expected to remain in hospital for at least another day. ‘TIA is a warning stroke and gives a patient time to act and keep a permanent stroke from occurring,’ Dr. Emil Matarese of St. Mary’s Medical Center in Langhorne, Pa. told the American Stoke Association's website. ‘By recognizing TIA symptoms and getting to the hospital, the patient can get help in identifying why the TIA occurred and get treatment - either through medication or surgery - that can prevent a stroke from occurring.’ Fortunately for Kubiak he was able to received immediate attention from medical staff at the Texans' stadium and was quickly transported to hospital where he was given Tissue Plasminogen Activator, which breaks down blood clots in people who suffer strokes. Houston Texans coach Gary Kubiak - just 52 - suffered a Transient Ischemic Attack which could lead to full-blown stroke within a year if not properly treated . A Transient Ischemic Attack is often referred to as a ‘mini-stroke’ because it is caused by blood clots just as stokes are. The key difference is that in a TIA, the clots clear more quickly. Most TIAs last about one minute, and generally don’t last longer than five minutes. TIAs don’t generally cause permanent brain damage or loss of motor function, but they are serious warning signs and lead to a higher probability of strokes in the future. About a third of those who have TIAs suffer strokes within a year. Medical experts refer to a TIA as a 'warning stroke' that gives a patient time to act - either through medication or surgery - to prevent a stroke from occurring. The coach's diagnosis is being treated as ‘good news in the relative sense’ by his employers. 'It is treatable, which seems to be the reason for the optimism when you talk to Texans people,' reported NFL Media Insider Ian Rapoport. Texans general manager Rick Smith released a statement on Monday in which he said the team's primary concern was Gary’s health and well-being. ‘There have been so many people . throughout the city and across the country that have reached out to . express their love and support and we are thankful for everyone’s . thoughts and prayers. Gary is alert, coherent and in good spirits. He . is continuing to be evaluated and monitored.’ There is no clear timeline for Kubiak’s return, nor has the team announced any plans for an interim head coach. Defensive . coordinator Wade Phillips, who has been the head coach for the Denver . Broncos, Buffalo Bills and Dallas Cowboys in his career, took Kubiak’s . place in the second half of the loss to the Colts.

The reintroduction of cursive handwriting lessons in North Carolina public schools has caused surprise unrest. State representative, Pat Hurley who was behind the move, told Today this morning that she has received a number of 'personal' complaints from educators and parents. One father-of-two telephoned her to tell her that handwriting is a 'total waste of time', while a teacher complained that 'these children will never use it in their lifetime.' The write stuff: The reintroduction of cursive handwriting lessons into North Carolina public schools has caused surprise unrest, with parents and teachers deeming it 'outdated' Before the bill, elementary schools were not required to teach cursive. This is because the national Common Core Standards, rolled out in 2010 and adopted by 45 U.S. states, does not . include it as part of the curriculum. Instead students are required to 'demonstrate sufficient command of keyboarding skills.' Ms Hurley, said she was inspired to push for the Back to Basics bill, after she received thank you notes from a group of fourth graders, following a field trip. 'It struck me as strange that they were not writing [in cursive],' she said. 'It was like these kids weren’t educated. I mean, this isn’t hieroglyphics we’re talking about.' 'It was like these kids weren't educated. I mean, this isn't hieroglyphics we're talking about' Thanks to her campaigning, the bill was passed on April 4 2013, drawing 107 yes votes with no dissenters. However, now she has revealed that there has since been 'pushback' from the public. Indeed, Joel Mathis expressed his opposition to writing lessons in an article for The Philly Post. 'We have machines to do this stuff for us. Who writes letters anymore? 'Except for signing my name to checks and legal documents, I’ve barely used cursive in 20 years . . . All my writing happens at a keyboard. This, I think, is progress. 'With so much to teach our students, maybe we should stick to the stuff they’ll actually find useful as workers and as citizens. Cursive isn’t really on that list.' Others argue that while handwriting is important, cursive isn't. Sign of the times: Today's school curriculum requires students to 'demonstrate sufficient command of keyboarding skills' and no guidelines on handwriting are included . Handwriting expert and instructor Kate Gladstone told Mashable: 'Teaching . handwriting doesn’t mean it has to be cursive, any more than teaching . math means it has to be in Roman numerals.' She . advocates for students learning to read cursive but opposes cursive . handwriting mandates, saying that cursive writing should just be an . elective. Despite this, the majority appear to be on Ms Hurley's side. 'I don't think we’re in a world that is completely cursive free at this point. We need to prepare our students for the unknown future' Tracey Neylon, a mother-of-two from Newport, Rhode Island., told Today that she thinks 'it’s important to be able to write it to be a functioning member . of society.' And Tessa Maguire, a third grade teacher in Michigan City, Indiana, pointed out: 'I don’t think we’re in a world that is completely cursive free at this point. We need to prepare our students for the unknown future.' Meanwhile Hollywood actress, Kirstie Alley wrote on Twitter: 'I'm HORRIFIED to hear . that American children will no longer learn CURSIVE!!!!

A man has been found guilty of murdering his girlfriend's three-year daughter because he was jealous that she was getting more attention than him. Lylah Aaron suffered a fatal brain injury and three broken ribs after she was kicked, slapped, shaken and punched in the head by Delroy Catwell. Catwell had denied killing Lylah and blamed her injuries on the girl's mother Precious Chibanda. But a jury at Sheffield Crown Court found him guilty of murder today after a two week trial. He will be sentenced tomorrow. Facing jail: Delroy Catwell, left, has been found guilty of murdering his girlfriend's three-year-old daughter Lylah Aaron, right . Ms Chibanda, who found it too upsetting to attend much of the trial, broke down in tears as the verdict was read out. The court had heard from medical experts that the force used to break Lylah's ribs was similar to that seen in a car crash or a fall from a tall building. As well as a 'sustained and forceful attack' on Lylah hours before she died, the jury was told that Catwell also slammed the tot’s head . against a bedroom wall damaging the plaster three weeks previously - . claiming he hit the wall because he was trying to kill a spider. Seven months before she died, Lylah was found with a bruised neck which . Catwell said was caused when she banged her head on a sink. Paramedics were called on February 8 when Ms Chibanda found Lylah was not . breathing when she returned from work at Derby Royal Infirmary. She asked . Catwell to help but he did not respond. She said: 'He looked like he . was in shock. He was just frozen.' Paramedics . discovered Lylah’s body was rigid and attempted resuscitation. She was . rushed to Sheffield Children’s Hosptal but later died. Poignant: Tributes are left outside Lylah Aaron's family home after she died from head injuries earlier this year . Prosecutor Bryan Cox QC said: 'There . were numerous bruises over her body. 'There was . substantial bruising to her head and fractures to her ribs. 'The injuries . indicated she had been subject to a sustained and forceful assault that . had occurred within hours of her admission to hospital.' Mr Cox had told the court: 'The couple’s relationship was generally good but sometimes he would complain he felt sidelined and she gave too much to Lylah.' 'This murder was a forceful and . sustained attack on a defenceless three-year-old girl.' Det Supt David Barraclough . Catwell, an unemployed DJ, told police the girl was full of energy and he found it hard to deal with her demands while trainee nurse Miss Chibanda said 'he at times mentioned that I perhaps smothered her.' Lylah’s mother had gone to work on the day her daughter died but Catwell failed to take Lylah to nursery where staff described her as 'bright' and a 'confident, bubbly little girl'. He claimed the girl was tired and had been ill for a few days so after watching cartoons he put her to bed that afternoon. He told police: 'I have never hit Lylah. I didn’t cause any injuries whatsoever.' Experts said he must have inflicted the fatal injuries before Miss Chibanda returned from work at about 4.30pm. Hunt for clues: A forensics officer enters the Sheffield home of Lylah Aaron. Scientific evidence suggests that her head was banged off a wall in the main bedroom of the house . A pathologist reported that the bruises to Lylah’s head were 'typical of non-accidental injuries' and bruising in and behind the left ear 'suggested impact from a hard object with a straight linear surface.' He went on: 'Other bruises could have been caused by kicks, slaps or punches.' All the bruises had been caused within 24 hours of her death. Medical experts found scar tissue on the brain indicating a three-week-old injury and four rib fractures, one of which was about three weeks old. The other three fresh breaks had been caused by 'squeezing or compression'. The medics concluded Lylah died from repeated impacts causing fatal bleeding to the brain. The court was told that Catwell had a previous conviction for sexual assault against a 13-year-old girl in August, 2005 . Andrew Robertson QC, defending, said the attack on Lylah was not pre-meditated and although he admitted there were as number of impacts the court could 'never be sure in this case that there was an intention to kill.' Judge Justice Nicola Davies, heard pre-sentence submissions from both barristers who agreed that Catwell will receive a life sentence with a minimum term to be fixed by the judge. Both lawyers also agreed the judge's starting point for fixing the minimum term was 15 years but she could increase this by taking into account aggravating factors. Mr Cox said these factors should include the vulnerability of the victim, the abuse of a position of trust, the previous violence towards Lylah, the fact he tried to blame his partner for the murder and his previous conviction. Life sentence: Catwell will be sentenced at Sheffield Crown Court, pictured, tomorrow . After the verdict investigating officer . Det Supt David Barraclough said: 'This murder was a forceful and . sustained attack on a defenceless three-year-old girl.

Ban: An advert for Maximus penis enlargement capsules, featured in four-page direct mailing Life Healthcare, has been banned by the ASA after it offended a complainant . An advert for penis enhancement capsules that suggested a man was 'inadequate' has been banned. The man contacted advertising watchdogs after reading ads telling him his penis size was a 'disappointment' and that his partner might be 'turned off'. The ad for Maximus penis enlargement capsules boasted that men could 'have a penis that's inches longer and much thicker naturally, without surgery, pumps or exercise'. The direct mailing, headed 'Dear XXXX',  asked if 'the size of your penis a disappointment to you and your partner' and whether the 'inability to satisfy your partner leaves you demoralised and depressed'. It goes on to say 'Your lack of confidence and low self esteem is making you unattractive to others', adding 'any partner you have is simply turned off by your small size'. One man, whose name is unknown, took such offence at the ads that he contacted the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). He had viewed the adverts in Life Healthcare, a four-page mailing that he received on a monthly basis. The ASA noted the man had not requested the mailing and might be put out by ads suggesting his penis size might be a 'disappointment'.

Another image showed a woman's legs with knickers pulled down to around her knees alongside the words 'No Strings Dating'. A third image showed two men embracing and two women leaning in to kiss each other alongside the words 'Gay Dating'. The dating site said it hadn't received any complaints despite more than 45,000 copies of the circular having been distributed. It said no-one it has asked for comments about the leaflet thought their children could or would be affected by the circular, and that 'more graphic' images could be seen in lingerie catalogues which were sometimes posted through letterboxes. However, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) upheld the single complaint and ordered that it must not appear again in its current form. An ASA spokesman said: 'We understood the circular had been posted through letterboxes and could therefore be seen by children.","Maximus penis enlargement capsules ad in direct mail banned by ASA .

A grove of hemlock trees at the Pennsylvania Flight 93 Memorial is under threat after being infested by an invasive insect. The hemlocks, often referred to as 'witness trees,' near where the hijacked plane crashed in Shanksville on September 11, 2001, have been invaded by the hemlock woolly adelgid, a tiny insect that feeds by sucking sap from the trees. A spokesperson from the Flight 93 National Memorial said Wednesday that the hemlocks are infested with the insect, which can kill trees within a few years, but hope a treatment plan will be able to save them. Tiny killers: Adult woolly hemlock adelgids only measure 1mm but an infestation can kill a 100-foot-tall tree in five years . Tragedy site: Investigators at the hemlock grove where United Airlines Flight 93 crashed near Shanksville, Pennsylvania on September 12, 2001, which is now being threatened by tiny insects . The insect was accidentally introduced to the U.S. from Asia in 1924, and figures from 2007 show that 50 per cent of the geographic range of eastern hemlock had been impacted by the insect.'I would say the stand is prettily heavily infested,' Rick Turcotte, an entomologist with the U.S. Forest Service, told The Associated Press. 'Trees are showing fairly significant impact,' such as reduced growth, thinning of the crown, and off color needles. United Flight 93 was traveling from Newark, New Jersey, to San Francisco in 2001 when it was hijacked by four terrorists. Telltale sign: The tiny white egg sacks of the hemlock woolly adelgid are a visible sign the insect is taking hold of the tree . The 33 passengers and seven crew members were killed when the plane crashed after passengers fought back against hijackers. Plot: Flight 93 was one of four planes that were hijacked as part of the September 11 attacks; 44 people, including four terrorists, died in the crash . The 9/11 Commission said the terrorists likely wanted to crash the plane into the White House or the U.S. Capitol. The . National Park Service refers to the meadow and hemlock grove where the . plane crashed as the 'sacred ground,' because it's the final resting . place for many of the remains of the passengers and crew. Woolly adelgids, which are native to Asia, lay their eggs on the underside of hemlock branches, and the young insects feed on the sap of the trees, causing them to lose needles and die within five to 10 years. The insects appeared in Virginia in the 1950s and in southeastern Pennsylvania in 1969. They've been spreading north and west ever since. Turcotte said the Forest Service is . working with the National Park Service on a treatment plan for more than . 1,300 mature trees in the roughly 11-acre grove of hemlocks that will begin this week. They're . trying chemicals and even releasing a species of beetles that eats the . adelgids, which have no natural predators in the area. In . some other states and regions, adelgids have caused massive die-offs of . hemlocks, and scientists still aren't sure if they'll be able to save . the Flight 93 grove. 'In the big picture we don't really know if it's a losing battle,' Turcotte said of area. 'We're trying to maintain it in the condition it was in at the time of the crash.'The Flight 93 National Memorial is located in Shanksville, about 75 miles southeast of Pittsburgh. The memorial drew about 320,000 visitors last year.","A grove of hemlock trees at the site of the Flight 93 crash is infested by a tiny insect, the hemlock woolly adelgid .

They're there to study - but it must be hard when you live in Britain's biggest student house. Regent House in Plymouth, Devon, is home to 32 undergraduates who host parties around the clock in monster digs made up of four huge terraced homes knocked into one. Each week they collectively down 500 cans of beer, watch 1,300 hours of daytime TV, and eat 100 tins of beans. The tenants, all Plymouth University students, spend between £75 and £100 per week to live in the property just a short walk to campus. Making a mess: Eight females and 24 males live in the house, and it needs three cleaners six days a week to keep the place in good shape . Student meals: Charlotte uses a hob in one of the house's four kitchens. The residents have a loose schedule of who cooks and when . To meet their needs it is kitted out with 22 toilets and four kitchens. But, in a house where around 50 Pot Noodles and 150 takeaways are eaten a week, they produce quite a lot of rubbish - 20 bin bags worth. No wonder they have a team of three cleaners on site six days a week just to take care of the mess. Photos taken by housemates of life inside the house show endless parties - with people asleep in corridors and students drinking beer from a bin. The 24 males and eight girls are supposed to attend 320 hours of lectures a week, on everything from civil engineering and business to fine art and midwifery. But that figure is dwarfed by the estimated 1,300 hours spent watching student TV favourites like Countdown - and the 900 hours spent on one of the numerous PlayStations. Student Thomas Riggs, 20, has managed to keep up with his studies while living in Regent House for three years. Party time: The students dressed up before a party inside the sprawling property. Even former students return to let the good times roll . Drinking games: Ed Joseph downs a 'beer bong' while his mates cheer him on. Constant partying can make the place distracting and 'crazy' Gentle pursuits: When students aren't studying, cooking or partying, they can be found playing pool or darts - or hide and seek with the lights out . The third-year English and Creative Writing student said: 'We go on several nights out a week and pretty much every night we have a drink in the house - so it pretty much feels like one big party. 'The house is crazy and intense but at the same time it's a lot of fun. We're like one very, very big family. 'We all get on really well and it's great to have so many different personalities and characters in one house. Christmas is my favourite time of year - last year we had over 50 people over for dinner.' Knocked through: Regent House started life as four separate terraced houses, which were knocked through into one complex of rooms . Heavy night? While many say that the non-stop drinking can be exhausting - these pale and bloodied faces are not the results of hard partying - but make-up ahead of a Halloween party . No need for furniture: When the fun kicks off in earnest, any part of the enormous property - including halls and floors - are used . Floor plan: An architectural drawing of Regent House shows multiple rooms, many of them en-suite, 22 other toilets, seven showers, one bath and three kitchens . The cavernous accommodation started out life as four Victorian properties in the city's Mutley suburb, which were originally knocked together into a nursing home. In the 1990s it was converted into communal accommodation and is now marketed by a private landlord as an 'A Graded Student Letting'. Most rooms have en-suite loos and washbasins, and there are 22 other toilets and seven shower cubicles dotted over two floors. Passed out: Not all the rooms in the property are always in use, as one student can be seen here preferring a hard cold kitchen floor to a nice warm bed . Keeping clean: One of the seven shower rooms, this one is a dual one. But students who prefer a bath might need to be a little more patient - as there is only one in the property . Student life: A world exists outside the property, of course, as can be seen in this photo of students watching the sunrise over Plymouth, Devon . Every now and then, they do some study: George Daykin, 21, in his room - showing that some serious work does get done . Multicultural: The students, who come from countries across the globe and are aged between 18 to 24, study subjects ranging from civil engineering, to fine art to business to midwifery . Students outside Regent house in Plymouth, Devon, which is Britain's biggest student house . It boasts just one dining room but three separate kitchens equipped with five freezers, five fridges, four ovens and four washing machines. Students can also laze around in two spacious lounges equipped with flat-screen TV's and Sky satellite television, or use a dart board and full-size pool table. The property is full from September to July, raking in around £11,520 a month and about £126,000 a year in rent for the owner. Feeling woozy? A student with bins full of booze, about to take a gulp. Little wonder, then, that the photograph is out of focus . Cupboard is almost bare: Many former university students will look at this image with a pang of nostalgia, and a pang of hunger . How many of these freezers contain vodka? The property also contains five fridges and four washing machines - all being in full use befre and after one of the many parties . On average each week the 32 students get through: . 40 loo rolls; 20 bin bags of rubbish; 100 tins of baked beans; 20 large bags of pasta; 500 cans of beer; 150 cans of cider; 50 Pot Noodles; 150 takeaways. Each week they collectively spend: . 320 hours at lectures; 311 hours partying at nightclubs; 1,300 hours watching TV; 900 hours playing PlayStation; 224 hours playing pool. The sprawling house is comprised of: . 32 bedrooms; 22 toilets; two living rooms; three kitchens; one utility room; seven showers (four of which are duo); one bath; a pool table; a dart board; four washing machines; five fridges; five freezers; four ovens. Regent House has a warden who works in . an office in the property five days a week, and when he's not there . Thomas deals with complaints and other issues. Students . cook throughout the evening in unofficial shifts from 5pm to midnight, . often teaming up for massive stir-fries before taking turns to do the . washing up. There's one space going spare at the moment because two people are a couple - and have moved in to the same room. Mr Riggs added: 'We almost have a system in place whereby the longer people have lived in the house, the nicer their room is. 'As I've lived here for three years, I've upgraded from one of the smallest rooms in the house to a large room with bay windows and an en-suite. 'The great thing is that it's like living in halls but for three years. 'I thought about moving out for my third year, as I thought it would be too distracting, but I knew I'd miss it a lot so decided to stay. It's not for everyone, but I love it.' Doing a 'starfish': George Streets is ably helped by a number of assistants as he completes a tricky stunt that - of course - involves drinking beer . Dietetics student Sara Jones, 19, said: 'It's so much fun living in the house. It can be noisy and hectic but I'm pretty noisy, so it's fine. 'The house can be a big distraction and it's often really hard to stay in when there's so many people drinking, as it feels like a house party, so I'll normally end up joining in. 'After nights out we'll often discover people who don't live here who've slept in the house. It can be pretty crazy. 'Hide and seek in the house is a lot of fun. We turn all the lights off then hide in random places.' Old housemates who have left university visit the property regularly to relive their student days. Rachael Warren, 20, who graduated last year and now works as a waitress, said: 'I live down the road but come here a couple of times a week. 'I felt it was best I moved out of Regent House once I decided to leave uni and get a job, because of how distracting it can be, but I still come for all the nights out - there's no better place for it.'","Regent House in Plymouth, Devon, is made up of four terraced homes .

After years of recession, growing unemployment and swingeing spending cuts, it is little wonder that some Spaniards are at the end of their tether with their country's fiscal state. And some have found a novel way of venting their frustration - writing angry messages on banknotes. Several hit out at the Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy while some are aimed at the country's bankers. Anger: Politicians and bankers are a 'disgrace to the nation' according to this five Euro note . Not happy: The emotive scrawling on this note accuses trade unions in Spain of being 'spongers' One of the messages, written on a 10 Euro note says: 'This money has been laundered, please don't circulate.' One angry Spaniard defaces a five Euro note, writing: 'Politicians and bankers are a disgrace to the nation.' While another takes his anger out on trade unions, labeling them 'spongers'. In perhaps the shortest outburst, one person has scrawled across a five Euro note 'Justice is rubbish'. Most of the messages are short and concise. But others are more of a rant. Defaced: 'This banknote is laundered, please do not circulate' writes this angry Spaniard . One Spaniard chose a 50 Euro note to write a scathing message to bankers. It translates: 'Politicians and bankers, as I know full well this note will end up in your hands, I wanted to take the chance to send you a private message. 'Politicians and bankers are a disgrace to the nation.' Message on a Spanish banknote . 'You're a bunch of thieving sons of b******! I invite all of you to leave a private message to them as I'm sure it will reach them.' One Spaniard describes politicians and bankers as 'a disgrace to the nation.' It is little wonder that many Spaniards are uptight about the state of the country's finances. Despite news last month that the country had finally exited recession with a 0.1 per cent economic growth, unemployment is still painfully high. Economists warned that the road to recovery will be long and tough for the Eurozone's fourth biggest economy, with around 26 per cent of the adult population still without a job. Personal: This note sends a rather abusive message to Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy . Unemployment is expected to remain exceptionally high for at least another five years. And Christmas is unlikely to be a season of much goodwill in Spain - spending during the holiday season is expected to fall by around 11.5 per cent this year, according to the Spanish Federation of Independent users and consumers. Christmas spending is down a staggering 71 per cent since the market crash in 2008, with Spaniards spending more than a third less on toys for youngsters since. Despite the drop, Christmas spending in Spain can still be seen as relatively high when compared to other countries. Spain had been shelling out around 813 Euros (£696) per person - more than Americans spent.","Spain said it exited its second recession since 2008 only last week .

Culture secretary Maria Miller has announced plans to give mobile phone users new protection against rip-off bills . Mobile phone users are to get new protection against rip-off bills. Consumers will have the right to switch providers without charge if firms try to impose unexpected price increases, bills for lost or stolen phones will be capped and ministers want roaming charges scrapped by 2016. The measures come as the political parties compete to help families with the cost of living. Culture Secretary Maria Miller, who drew up the plans, said a new  ‘liability cap’ on mobiles that are lost or stolen will start next spring. Though the level of the cap has yet to be agreed, it will work in a similar way to the £50 limit for debit and credit cards that are lost or stolen. Customers hit with mid-contract price rises will be free either to accept them or to end their contract without penalty. Mobile phone firms have angered customers by increasing monthly bills on 18 or 24-month agreements. This summer, for example, Virgin Mobile increased tariffs for consumers locked into its supposed ‘fixed price’ contracts by 2.9 per cent. Consumer group Which? has called for action, with 60,000 people signing its ‘Fixed Means Fixed’ petition. Separately, the Government says it wants to end EU roaming charges, which add to the cost of using a mobile outside the UK. The action on these charges comes after the EU announced plans for a crackdown. Four mobile companies – EE, Three, Virgin Media and Vodafone – have agreed to the measures, Mrs Miller said. Consumer Affairs Minister Jo Swinson said she welcomed agreement from the phone companies to help protect customers . She added: ‘We are ensuring hardworking families are not hit with shock bills through no fault of their own. Families can be left struggling  if carefully planned budgets are blown away by unexpected bills from a stolen mobile or a mid-contract price rise.’ Consumer Affairs Minister Jo Swinson said: ‘The last thing you need after the hassle of a stolen mobile is to find that someone has used it and landed you with a sky-high bill too. ‘Phone companies have listened to government and to their customers and I welcome their agreement to protect them from unexpected costs and mid-contract price rises.’ Currently, consumers are usually unable to cancel a contract without paying a fee, unless the increase is above a fixed amount. Under the new system, phone users are expected to get at least a month’s notice of bill increases and the right to switch providers without charge. In 2007, the EU attempted to limit the roaming charges imposed on people using their phones outside the UK. But firms are still hitting customers with huge mark-ups on what they pay local phone companies for use of their networks. Ministers say they want roaming charges abolished altogether within the EU and to bring them down dramatically for calls outside the EU. ‘We want to make it cost the same to ring Brighton from Barcelona as it does to ring Brighton from Birmingham,’ a Government source said.","New measures announced as political parties compete to help families face the battle against the rising cost of living .

Paul Massara, CEO of Npower, is sending a letter to customer apologising for failings following a Money Mail investigation . Npower has been forced to make a grovelling apology to 3.4million customers for the appalling service they received this year. The firm will also pay £1million to help vulnerable households with their heating bills. A Money Mail investigation this year revealed that scores of Npower customers were sent wildly incorrect bills and had to put up with delays in having overpayments refunded. The Mail sent a dossier of complaints to the firm and regulator Ofgem, sparking a major inquiry. Sarah Harrison, senior partner at Ofgem, said: ‘The huge growth in complaints about Npower is wholly unacceptable and is why we intervened.’ Npower receives five times as many complaints as Scottish & Southern Energy – the Big Six energy firm with the best record for complaints, according to the watchdog Consumer Futures. The number of problems involving Npower that are being dealt with by the independent Energy Ombudsman has also trebled in the past 12 months. The three main areas of concern include problems setting up accounts, direct debit payments and billing. Many customers have repeatedly been sent incorrect bills, despite supplying the firm with regular, accurate meter readings, while some have not been sent a bill at all. Others have been forced to battle for months to claw back money they had overpaid because their monthly direct debit had been set too high. On Sunday, customers saw their gas and electricity bills rise by an average of £139. The 10.4 per cent increase was the largest announced by the Big Six suppliers this winter. Npower has five times as many complaints as Scottish and Southern Energy, the Big Six supplier with the best customer service record . Npower boss Paul Massara is sending apology letters to all customers this week. He will tell customers: ‘We’ve let many of our domestic customers down and I wanted to write to each of them personally to say sorry. 'Although we’ve made good progress fixing many of the underlying issues, we still have a long way to go, and our customers deserve to get the best possible service. That is my commitment.’ The firm has promised no customer will be left out of pocket by its mistakes. It is making a £1million payment to its Health Through Warmth scheme, a crisis fund that supports vulnerable homeowners with cold-related illnesses. Half of the money will go to Macmillan Cancer Support. A team of 800 customer advisers will clear complaints. A spokesman said: ‘Earlier this year the Mail sent us a number of customer complaints from their readers.

Number one: Agatha Christie has been voted the best ever crime writer by members of the Crime Writers Association . Agatha Christie has scooped the award for the best ever whodunit for one of her early Hercule Poirot novels - The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd. As well as winning the gong for best ever crime novel, Agatha Christie was also voted the number one crime writer of all time. Christie wrote 66 detective novels and 14 short story collections over her career. She also wrote six romances under the name Mary Westmacott but remains best known for her crime fiction. But she missed out on the 'best ever crime series' - with the accolade going to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle for Sherlock Holmes. He wrote four full-length novels and 56 short stories on the master sleuth's adventures between 1887 and 1927. The results of the Crime Writers Association poll of 600 fellow writers was announced at the society's 60th birthday celebrations. And despite being written in 1926, it was decided that The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd remains the greatest example of the genre to this day. In the novel, Poirot is called upon to investigate the village murder of Ackroyd whose untimely demise came hard on the heels of the death of that of the wealthy widow he had been hoping to marry. Rivals for the award included The Silence of the Lambs by Thomas Harris and two novels by Raymond Chandler. But critics have questioned why the poll failed to include popular modern Scandinavian crime writers such as Stieg Larsson who wrote The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo trilogy and Jo Nesbo who penned Police.' Alison Joseph, chair of the CWA, said Christie’s 'elegant precision and her perfect sense of place' continues to ensure her title as one of the best crime writers of all time. A classic: The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd is one of Christie's first to feature detective Hercule Poirot, played in a long-running ITV series by David Suchet pictured, and has been voted the best crime novel ever written . She told the Independent: 'The fact is, our genre continues to be so popular precisely because of its long and rich history, and our winners reflect that. 'The Holmes/Watson double act is unbeatable, which is why it has been borrowed, re-written and reworked by numerous authors for at least a century.' Christie still remains the best-selling novelist of all time, according to the Guinness Book of World Records. Her novels have sold roughly four billion copies, and her estate claims that her works rank third in the most-widely published books after those of William Shakespeare and the Bible. Award-winning: Agatha Christie's Miss Marple, depicted above by Joan Hickson in a BBC series, was another one of the novelist's popular detective series . According to Index Translationum, Christie is also the most-translated individual author with her books translated into at least 103 languages. And Then There Were None is Christie's best-selling novel with 100 million sales to date, making it the world's best-selling mystery ever, and one of the best-selling books of all time. In 1955, Christie was the first recipient of the Mystery Writers of America's highest honour, the Grand Master Award, and in the same year Witness for the Prosecution was given an Edgar Award by the MWA for Best Play. Many of her books and short stories have been filmed, and many have been adapted for television, radio, video games and comics.","The 1926 novel is still considered one of the best examples of the genre .

Valsecchi, 34, won the Hasselblad Masters Award in 2012 with the photographic project inspired by 'graphic duels'. Olivier Valsecchi, winner of the Hasselblad Masters Award 2012, was asked to create photos that 'evoke' Camera-makers Hasselblad, who grant the award to selected photographers each year in recognition of exceptional accomplishment, set a brief to create a new set of photos that represented one word: evoke. Valsecchi instinctively looked at Rorschach tests. 'It was a perfect fit for my project; I see a lot of human shapes in them, and I decided to make my own photographic take on the tests,' he told tech, science and art site theverge.com. The resulting works of art are entitled Klecksography, a photographic reimagining of the psychological Rorschach inkblot test. Up to seven models are posed together in each shot. 'The artistic concept of the series was . to make human sculptures, the technical concept of the series was to . make photo montages without digital manipulation,' Valsecchi explained. 'What you see is what you get on my camera's screen. It took at least . three hours to make each photo. Everything was . shot live. That was the real performance, and nightmare as well.' The result of that abstract brief was Klecksography, a photographic reimagining of the inkblot test . Without using any digital manipulation or Photoshop trickery, bodies are piled and folded over each other to create stunning images that resemble inkblot tests . He continued: 'The . first job was to cast people who looked alike. Then I showed them their . respective positions, placed everyone on the stage, and the game could . start.

In the original inkblot tests, coined in 1921 by Swiss psychologist Hermann Rorschach, patients were required . to find form in inky abstract patterns. Their perceptions of . inkblots are recorded and then analysed to diagnose mental disorders. Mana II, pictured here, was his most challenging shot. Originally set on two levels and featuring 12 people, it was supposed to recreate what could be perceived as a monster's head . While they were more popular in the late 20th Century, . Rorschach tests are still studied and utilised in some fields of . psychology today. They've also been immortalised by cult and pulp . fictional media, including the Watchmen graphic novel and film, which . featured an inkblot-masked antihero, aptly named Rorschach. Valsecchi, . from Paris, went to photography school to refine his techniques, and . his work has been exhibited around Europe, the US, and Asia.

With three in five of us claiming that seasonal stress is getting us down and, according to a new study, one in eight saying it's worse than childbirth, the festive season takes its toll on the skin in more ways than one. But help for stressed skin is at hand in the shape of a new serum that claims to wipe out signs of stress, including wrinkles and dull skin, in just 21 days. According to makers skyn ICELAND, the plant peptides contained in their £40 Arctic Elixir can also reduce stress induced cell damage, which causes sagging skin and fine lines, by up to 50 per cent. Making things worse: Stress can have a deleterious effect on your complexion - compounding the issue . 'Arctic Elixir contains a special Sodium Hyaluronate complex that instantly smoothes wrinkles,' explains Sarah Kugelman, who created skyn ICELAND after being unable to find products that worked for her stressed, sensitive skin. 'But the real power player in this serum comes from the two plant stem technologies. One is a plant peptide known as ""plant collagen"" that helps repair and protect skin's DNA. 'It reduces stress induced cell damage by over 50%, the type of damage that leads to wrinkles and sagging skin. 'The other plant stem cell is extracted from raspberries and is antioxidant and anti-inflammatory. It specifically targets stress induced irritation and aging by regulating nitric oxide levels on skin.' Along with creating wrinkles and dulling skin, according to skincare guru Ole Henriksen, stress can also lead to poor eating habits which make matters even worse. Before: skyn ICELAND'S founder Sarah Kugelman says stress makes sagging and premature wrinkles worse . After: The new £40 serum claims to erase premature ageing and eliminates skin problems caused by stress . Celebrity clients: Jessica Alba and Kate Moss both turn to Ole Henriksen when they need skincare advice . Solution: skyn ICELAND claim their Arctic Elixir can improved stressed skin in just 21 days . 'Stress often makes us reach for all the . wrong kinds of food,' he reveals. 'Too much sugar and sodium are among the greatest . enemies of skin. 'Sodium causes bloating and fluid retention in the skin . (puffy eye region), while an excess of sugar causes the skin to become . red and rashy and causes eruptions. 'Another thing I have observed is . when people are highly stressed they show more tension in the face and . frown more.' Despite Christmas being just a few weeks away, Henriksen, whose celebrity clients include Kate Moss and Jessica Alba, says there are some easy ways to reduce stress ahead of the big day. 'Stress can . easily be avoided by organising your daily life,' he explains. 'First start by writing . down a daily schedule or calendar for both personal and professional use because a . better overview of things will make you feel more in charge. 'You . shouldn’t get up five minutes before a meeting - get up early and take your . time to eat a good breakfast, connect with your family, and give . yourself ample time to arrive early. 'During the day, if . you find yourself a little overwhelmed in your head or body, take five . minutes to do some deep breathing (closing your eyes) and stretching, while . allowing yourself to recharge your batteries. 'Take time for you with . family and friends, exercise and make sure you laugh.' TRY TO SLEEP FOR AT LEAST SEVEN TO EIGHT HOURS A NIGHT . 'This . not only helps you recharge and replenish but the body’s own renewal . happens at this time.   Sleep also helps to lower your cortisol levels,' says Sarah. She adds: 'When cortisol is too high it has many negative effects on health . including our skin.  Cortisol increases oil production and can break . down skin collagen, the protein that keeps skin smooth and elastic. GET INTO YOGA . 'I've been doing yoga for 15 years and it saved . me,' Sarah reveals. 'It is not only an incredible way to release tension by stretching . and relaxing the muscles but it also helps you slow down mentally. TUCK INTO MORE TURKEY . 'There's a whole list of stress reducing . foods including oranges, sweet potatoes, apricots, avocados, turkey, . salmon and kale,' she adds. 'A German study in psychopharmacology found that vitamin . C helps reduce stress and return blood pressure and cortisol to normal . levels after a stressful situation.' PAMPER YOURSELF . 'I have spa nights all the time and it's amazing how . restorative they can be. Take a hot shower in the candlelight, play . soothing music, slather on a face mask, have a hot cup of tea . and crawl in bed with a good book.' TURBO CHARGE YOUR SKIN . For me, bad skin equals stress and vice versa.

Despite many of Ashley Taylor Dawson’s fans being devastated at his elimination from Strictly Come Dancing on Sunday, it seems his family may welcome the end of his grueling schedule. The Hollyoaks star, whose long term partner Karen McKay gave birth to their second child Mason Mac in October, has confessed that combining filming Hollyoaks with his Strictly rehearsals has meant he has been too busy to bond with his new son. Speaking to Attitude magazine Ashley said being parted from his family was ‘the hardest thing’ about taking part in the intense dancing competition. Ashley Taylor-Dawson has stripped off for the cover of gay magazine Attitude . Despite his recent sleep deprivation Ashley shows no sign of fatigue as he gazes seductively into the camera, showing off the results of the grueling dance rehearsals . He . said: ‘When I get up at 7am, I get to see my little boy and my new baby . for a little while, but that’s about it really. I feel really guilty . about not being there with my family, I hate it. “Daddy go to work now” is all I ever hear from my little boy at the moment.' ‘I haven’t really bonded with my baby yet. My fiancée Karen has just been incredible – she’s really holding the fort. It’s an overwhelming time in any parent’s life taking on another child and she’s doing it all on her own at the moment.’ Describing the last few months actor Ashley, who lives in Manchester, said that he has been lucky to get five hours sleep a night: ‘It’s full on. I’m in work [at . Hollyoaks] at 8am every morning and yesterday I didn’t finish filming . until 8.30pm. Then I went straight to the dance studio for 9.15pm and . trained until 1.15am.

Russian police are hunting a 'granny-killing sadist' who has 'murdered 32 pensioners' in two years after posing as a housing official and gaining entry to their homes.

From Cinderella and her glass slipper to the tragic tale of the Little Mermaid, fairytales are a quintessential part of childhood. Now some of the world's best-loved stories have been brought to life in a collection of beautifully illustrated new books - just in time for Christmas. The Grey and Orange Fairy Books were collated by Andrew Lang, a 19th century Scottish poet and anthropologist who made it his life's work to collect and translate children's tales from all over the globe. Stunning: Tomislav Tomić's gorgeous illustration accompanying a story entitled The Girl-Fish . Pretty: Illustrations from The Simpleton (left) and The Bear created by Lauren Nassef for the Grey Fairy Book . But although the tales are old, the spectacular Illustrations come courtesy of two very modern artists: Croatian Tomislav Tomić and American Lauren Nassef. Among the tales featured in the books, which are part of a set that includes new editions of the Crimson Fairy Book and the Yellow Fairy Book, are those of the Ugly Duckling, the Sunchild, the Queen of the Flowery Isles and the Little Mermaid. Each of the books in the collection, published by The Folio Society, features the work of a different artist commissioned to produce bespoke illustrations for the series. Explaining how he created the stunning images that accompany the Orange Fairy Book, illustrator and children's author Tomislav Tomić said: 'Some books are easier to illustrate than other books and that was the case with Orange Fairy Book. Traditional tales: Illustrations by Tomislav Tomić from The Hero Makóma (left) and The White Doe (right) Delicate: A beautifully rendered illustration of the Ugly Duckling created by Tomislav Tomić .

'I was very excited when this project started to happen - working on a book that reminds me of the books from the Golden Age of  Illustration in Europe was like a dream coming true. 'Fairytales are my favourite type of stories to illustrate because it is always easy to find some interesting scenes to draw.' Among his work is a delicately rendered scene from Danish author Hans Christian Andersen's classic tale of the Ugly Duckling. Others accompany less well-known tales, translated from numerous languages, among them Gaelic, Cherokee, Catalan and Icelandic. Some of the more unusual stories include How Ian Direach got the Blue Falcon, a story that hails from the Scottish Highlands, and a Berber yarn entitled The Clever Cat. Particularly striking is The White Slipper, a Spanish story that reverses the Cinderella story and features a king who loses his precious white shoe and offers his . daughter’s hand to whoever finds it.

Jimmy Savile asked BBC security staff to allow girls and women free passage to his dressing room when the paedophile demanded, a letter revealed today. A handwritten note, scrawled by the DJ on Stoke Mandeville Hospital headed paper, lays bare how he used his position of power to abuse hundreds of victims. Savile wrote to his 'BBC security friends' and asked them: 'Please admit these three ladies to my room, ta,', followed by his signature containing a smiling face. Chilling: This handwritten note, revealed today, shows how Savile asked his 'BBC security friends' to let women through to his dressing room, where he is alleged to abused many victims . The letter is understood to concern three female members of his staff, who were attending an event he was involved in. He died in October 2011, aged 84, having attacked hundreds of children he met at the BBC and at hospitals, charity events and schools. Police believe the Top Of The Pops and Jim’ll Fix It presenter attacked at least 1,300 people over the course of 54 years. Abuser: Savile attacked hundreds of children he met at the BBC and at hospitals, charity events and schools . At least 450 people were abused by the paedophile DJ on BBC premises. 'It perfectly illustrates the position of power Savile had,' a BBC source told the Mirror today. 'He . flattered and made friends with security staff and this enabled him to . carry out his horrendous attacks. He even wrote this on headed notepaper . of the National Spinal Injuries Centre. This was not unusual.' It is telling that the note is on Stoke Mandeville paper, where he is also accused of abusing victims in a private room he was given by management. In a 2009 police interview, released last month but done two years before he died, he fobbed off police with lies, bluster and legal threats. In it he boasted he ‘owned’ the NHS hospital at Stoke Mandeville and said he brushed off girls ‘like midges’. Publication of the interviews reignited speculation that some who worked at Stoke Mandeville deliberately overlooked Savile’s sexual abuse of patients because of the money he raised for the hospital. During the interview, Savile says: ‘I own this hospital, NHS run it, I own it, and that’s not bad. And one of the reasons that I get, that I take it seriously is that I wouldn’t let anything get out of hand to run the risk of spoiling things for my people here'. Later it emerged that the authorities believe he committed at least 22 sex crimes there. Last month a former BBC driver was found dead in an . apparent suicide ahead of his child sex abuse trial. The . body of David Smith, 67, chauffeur to disgraced DJ Jimmy Savile and . other celebrities during the 1980s, was found at his south-east London . home, on the eve of his court appearance. It later emerged the former driver was a . prolific sex offender with a string of previous convictions for sexual . offences against young boys, dating back to 1966, on his criminal . record. A BBC spokesman said today: 'The independent review led by Dame Janet Smith into the culture and practices of the BBC during the years that Jimmy Savile worked at the BBC is ongoing'.","Scrawled letter was written on Stoke Mandeville Hospital headed paper .

Victim of discrimination: Isabel Sitz pictured arriving at her first employment tribunal in July this year . A City banker was fired by a firm dubbed ‘Bunga Bunga Securities’ when she complained about bosses slashing her £95,000-a-year salary to the £6.08-an-hour minimum wage because she was a woman. Isabel Sitz, 42, told a tribunal how sexist managers at Oppenheimer Europe stripped her of lucrative client accounts. She said that boss Max Lami gave the best business to 'his boys', who could bond with male clients over beer, rugby and hunting. Another manager referred to her as 'sweetheart' and male colleagues compared their firm to the notorious sex parties of Italy’s Silvio Berlusconi in emails discussing ‘bunga bunga’, the tribunal heard. When Miss Sitz alleged gender discrimination over the sudden, £80,000 cut to her basic salary, she was fired the very next working day. A panel at Central London employment tribunal found that she suffered sex discrimination, victimisation and unfair dismissal. It ruled that Oppenheimer 'falsely claimed that there had been a real investigation' into Miss Sitz’s discrimination complaint. It noted that the firm would not let her approach her key contacts when they moved firms to drum up new business - but expected her to introduce her clients to new colleagues. And a poorly performing male colleague had staged reductions to his salary rather than being put on the then UK hourly minimum wage of £6.08. Miss Sitz is now set to receive substantial compensation from Oppenheimer for lost earnings and injury to feelings. In its judgment, the panel ruled: 'Looking at the evidence as a whole - and particularly the difference in treatment between the claimant and her colleagues - there is evidence from which we could infer, in the absence of an adequate explanation, that the claimant has been subject to sex discrimination in her dismissal and the process leading up to it.' The boss: Massimiliano 'Max' Lami pictured in July. The firm says it will appeal against the tribunal's findings . It added: 'We find that the claimant’s gender was a factor in Oppenheimer’s decision to dismiss her. 'In particular, we find that when the claimant’s figures reduced, Mr Lami was less willing to assist her to gain alternative clients than he would have been had she been a man.' Speaking after the judgment, Miss Sitz’s solicitor Andrej Pungerl, of law firm Stone Joseph, said: 'The tribunal had a full view of all the evidence and came to its decision, which vindicates Isabel and she is delighted by the decision.' Mr Pungerl declined to say how much compensation Miss Sitz is seeking from Oppenheimer after winning her case. He said: 'For Isabel, it is about the principle, not the money. 'Without the discrimination, Isabel ‘s career trajectory was of a senior, top broker.' Miss Sitz joined the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce World Markets in 2007. The bank was acquired by Oppenheimer, which provides investment services to institutional clients, the following year. Miss Sitz became an executive director for Oppenheimer, in charge of US equity sales. Giving evidence, she said: 'There were many comments about bunga bunga. That was done all the time. 'I kept my head down and worked rather than listening but there were also emails sent around, such as the reference to OpCo as ‘bunga bunga securities’ (when bunga bunga refers to erotic parties with sexual favours dispensed to men by women) which to my mind was demeaning. 'I couldn’t believe this was being sent around. Of course I was offended by this kind of thing.' In each of 2009 and 2010, Miss Sitz made around £1.2 million in revenue for the investment bank. She earned up to 25 per cent in commission from revenue brought in. And at her peak, she was the firm’s third best performer, bringing in 12 percent of its total revenue. But she claimed her performance plummeted after Mr Lami gave the best business to 'his boys'. She said: 'Max Lami has a PA called Nadia. He would call out her name, ‘Nadia, Nadia’. He was shouting at her. 'And then the boys in the office would shout ‘Nadia, Nadia’. She had to prepare his lunch every day in the kitchen. 'I remember a couple of occasions when he told me: ""Isabel, I don’t understand why my wife works. I bring in the money."" Things like that really shocked me.' Miss Sitz said her plight worsened when another boss, Robert Van Den Bergh, stripped her of more accounts and called her ‘sweetheart’. He said he was handing over her Irish accounts to John Todman because the clients were all ‘boyos’. She said: 'He called the Irish a bunch of lying, cheating, stealing time-wasters. He then went on to explain it is mostly about beer and rugby in Ireland, and so he thought I should be removed from the Irish accounts and they should be given to Mr Todman who could take the clients to rugby matches.' It was also said that it would not be appropriate for her to join male clients on hunting trips. But Mr Van Den Bergh insisted he only removed her from the Irish accounts because she was 'irrelevant and unknown' to the clients. He said his comments were a light-hearted attempt to take her off the accounts without hurting her feelings. Mr Lami told the tribunal that Miss Sitz was 'caught up in a fantasy of her own making' after being abandoned by her core client base. Miss Sitz said she 'begged' to be given more accounts and be allowed to contact potential clients but was 'ignored'. By 2012 she was left with just four accounts, only two of which made significant money and was a 'broken woman', she said. She said: “I wanted an equal opportunity for my success which I wasn’t given. I threatened the men. I think they felt threatened by me. 'I don’t like to be all walked over. That is what a woman has to go through in the City.' Miss Sitz complained of gender discrimination on Friday June 8, 2012 - and was made redundant on the following Monday. Spanish Miss Sitz, however, lost her claim of race discrimination. In a statement, the firm insisted today that it was right to fire her - despite the tribunal ruling of unfair dismissal. It said: 'Oppenheimer Europe was disappointed to learn of the tribunal’s decision, even though it dismissed a substantial portion of the claim, and believes the facts of the case supported a full dismissal. 'We are proud that both our male and female employees, comprising over a dozen nationalities, testified that the company does not engage in discrimination in the workplace. 'The company will review its options with its legal counsel, including taking an appeal of this decision.'","Isabel Sitz, 42, said sexist managers docked her pay by £80,000 .

One of the Utah Boy Scout leaders who was filmed toppling 170million-year-old rock formations at a state park claims his uncle was killed by falling rocks and he knocked over the monuments because he feared they would fall and hurt someone. David Hall says he and Glenn Taylor found the formations to be dangerously unstable and dangerously near hiking trails at Goblin Valley State Park in central Utah. Park rangers, though, are unmoved by Hall's story. They say that if the two men believed there was a danger, they should have alerted the proper authorities instead of destroying a geological wonder. The cameraman: Dave Hall told local media he is receiving death threats since the stunt . Father of the year: Glenn Taylor tipped over the rock while his son cheered him on . Hall's aunt told the Salt Lake Tribune that Hall was greatly effected by the sudden death of his uncle Michael Astel in 1982. Debra Woolley tells the newspaper that her late husband was hiking in Colorado with friends when a boulder suddenly came loose and tumbled onto the trail where he was hiking. He was crushed. 'I’m probably a little bit more paranoid about what a loose rock can do,' Hall said. Rangers are still investigating the case against Hall and Taylor over the October 11 incident. One stumbling block: Putting a price tag on the rock formations that they knocked over. However, state officials believe that . once they have determined the value of the damage, they will hand the . investigation over to prosecutors to pursue charges.

Celebration: Glenn and Dylan Taylor high-five while the cameraman, Dave Hall, laughs and whoops for joy .

'We encourage all leaders and Scouts . to review the ""Leave No Trace"" principles, as we are all a part of . maintaining the integrity, character and the natural beauty of the . outdoors for all living things,' the statement said. The rock formation they toppled over . is about 170 million years old, Utah State Parks spokesman Eugene . Swalberg said. The central Utah park is dotted with thousands of the . eerie, mushroom-shaped sandstone formations. The rock formations at Goblin Valley State Park in Utah are thousands of years old, formed by the erosion of the material around the base of the rock . Proud: The men said they were 'saving lives' because the loose rock could have fallen on a child . Hall and Taylor came under fire last month after posting a video on Facebook where Taylor can be seen wedging . himself between a formation and a boulder to knock a large rock off the . formation's top. Taylor and his two companions can then be seen . cheering, high-fiving and dancing. They said the rock formation was . loose and they feared it was dangerous. They were leading a group of . teenage Boy Scouts on a trip when it happened. Hall said they found out about losing . their Boy Scouts positions Monday morning.

Both . men are from Highland, Utah, about 30 miles south of Salt Lake City. 'We've always supported the Boy Scouts and if that's what they feel is best, we support that decision,' Hall said.

The study found that, unsurprisingly, the first great musical age is adolescence, which is defined by a short, sharp burst of 'intense' music . Plenty of teenagers might claim they will love One Direction forever or will never want to borrow a classical CD from their parents, but British scientists have found certain music genres are associated with five key stages in a human life. Music stays important to people as they age but what they listen to is chosen to suit particular 'life challenges' they face and meet social and psychological needs, the researchers said. They confirmed what may people have thought for a while - teenagers have little taste in music and what we listen to gets more boring as we grow older. Researchers at Cambridge University have identified five broad categories of musical taste during a person's life. They believe humans use music to experiment with identity and define themselves and then as a social vehicle to establish a group and find a mate, before using it to express their intellect, status and greater emotional understanding. The study suggests that unless people take the Who's advice and die before they get old, their taste in music will probably change to meet their social and psychological needs. Researchers said the study, published in the journal of Personality and Social Psychology, is the first to 'comprehensively document' the ways people engage with music 'from adolescence to middle age'. Using data gathered from more than a quarter of a million people over a ten year period, researchers divided musical genres into five broad categories they call the MUSIC model - mellow, unpretentious, sophisticated, intense, contemporary - and plotted the patterns of preference across age-groups. 'Intense' music, such as punk and metal peaks in adolescence and declines in early adulthood, while 'contemporary' music such as pop begins a rise that plateaus until early middle age. Dr Rentfrow said teenage years are often dominated by the need to establish identity and music is a cheap way to do this . These five categories incorporate multiple genres that share common musical and psychological traits - such as loudness and complexity. The study found that, unsurprisingly, the first great musical age is adolescence, which is defined by a short, sharp burst of ‘intense’ and the start of a steady climb of ‘contemporary’. ‘Intense’ music, such as punk and metal peaks in adolescence and declines in early adulthood, while ‘contemporary’ music such as pop and rap begins a rise that plateaus until early middle age. Dr Jason Rentfrow, senior researcher on the study, said: 'Teenage years are often dominated by the need to establish identity, and music is a cheap, effective way to do this.' ‘""Intense’ music, seen as aggressive, . tense and characterised by loud, distorted sounds has the rebellious . connotations that allow adolescents to stake a claim for the autonomy . that is one of this period’s key life challenges.' As 'intense' gives way to the rising tide of 'contemporary' and 'mellow', like R&B, in early adulthood, the next musical age emerges. Dr Rentfrow said 'these forms of music reinforce the desire for intimacy and complement settings where people come together with the goal of establishing close relationships' As ‘intense’ gives way to the rising tide of ‘contemporary’ and introduction of ‘mellow’, such as electronic and R&B, in early adulthood, the next musical age emerges. These two 'preference dimensions' are considered 'romantic, emotionally positive and danceable,' the researchers wrote. Dr Rentfrow said: 'Once people overcome the need for autonomy, the next life challenge concerns finding love and being loved – people who appreciate this ""you"" that has emerged.' 'What we took away from the results is that these forms of music reinforce the desire for intimacy and complement settings where people come together with the goal of establishing close relationships – parties, bars, clubs and so on. 'Whereas the first musical age is about asserting independence, the next appears to be more about gaining acceptance from others.' As people settle down and middle age begins to creep in, the last musical age, as identified by the researchers, is dominated by ‘sophisticated’ music, such as jazz and classical and ‘unpretentious’ tunes, such as country, folk and blues. As people settle down and middle age begins to creep in, the last musical age, as identified by the researchers, is dominated by 'sophisticated' music, such as jazz and classical and 'unpretentious' tunes, such as country, folk and blues . The researchers said both these dimensions are seen as 'positive and relaxing' with ‘sophisticated’ music indicating the complex aesthetic of high culture that could be linked to social status and perceived intellect, while ‘unpretentious’ echoes sentiments of family, love and loss – emotionally direct music that speaks to the experiences most will have had by this life stage. Dr Rentfrow said: 'As we settle into ourselves and acquire more resources to express ourselves – career, home, family, car – music remains an extension of this and at this stage there are aspects of wanting to promote social status, intellect and wealth that play into the increased gravitation towards ‘sophisticated’ music, as social standing is seen as a key life challenge to be achieved by this point. 'At the same time, for many this life stage is frequently exhausted by work and family, and there is a requirement for relaxing, emotive music for those rare down times that reflects the other major life challenge of this stage - that of nurturing a family and maintaining long-term relationships - perhaps the hardest of all.' Arielle Bonneville-Roussy from Cambridge’s Department of Psychology, who led the study, said: 'Due to our very large sample size, gathered from online forms and social media channels, we were able to find very robust age trends in musical taste. 'I find it fascinating to see how seemingly trivial behaviour such as music listening relates to so many psychological aspects, such as personality and age.' The study found that for many middle-aged people, frequently exhausted by work and family, there is a requirement for relaxing, emotive music for down times that reflect the other major life challenge of this stage - that of nurturing a family and maintaining long-term relationships .","British scientists found tastes shift in line with 'key life challenges'

It is the first time the plumbing of a decorative fountain from this period has been found almost complete outside the wealthier districts of Old Ramla, shedding light on the ingenious methods used to create water features in elaborate villas at the time.

It is the first time the plumbing of a decorative fountain from the 10th century has been found almost complete outside the wealthier districts of Old Ramla, shedding light on the ingenious methods used to create water features in elaborate villas . Experts said the ruins of the luxurious villa are the remains of ‘an affluent estate’ that had a fountain it its garden that dates from the Fatimid period, which covers the late 10th century to the first half of the 11th century. The fountain, made of mosaic covered with plaster and stone slabs, was uncovered west of the building and is connected to a system of pipes consisting of terracotta sections and connectors made of store jars, which led to the fountain.

Rapist: Marius Glad Trimbitas, 33, who was jailed for eight years for attacking a woman who was waiting for a bus home . A Romanian criminal who was deported eight years ago was able to come back to Britain and rape a woman at a bus stop. Homeless Marius Glad Trimbitas, 33, was kicked out of the country in 2005 after an attack on a prostitute. But he returned this year, and within six months carried out a horrific drug-fuelled assault on a woman waiting for a bus  after a night out. The case raises worrying questions about border controls and how a convicted criminal was able to return to Britain. Last night, police launched an appeal for any other potential victims to come forward, warning that they ‘cannot rule out he has done this before’. Trimbitas was deported in 2005 following the conviction for false imprisonment of the prostitute, Woolwich Crown Court heard. He was given a two-year conditional discharge – effectively a slap on the wrist. But it is thought the nature of the offence, and the lack of proper punishment, meant his criminal record was not uploaded to border watch lists, allowing him to return in March this year. Last month, he targeted his 24-year-old victim after she left the Ministry of Sound nightclub near Elephant and Castle in South London. Sentencing him to eight years in jail, Judge Alice Robinson said the attack had a ‘devastating’ impact on the woman. Evidence: A shoe Marius Glad Trimbitas abandoned at the scene after being fought off by passers by who heard his victim's screams. Forensic tests were carried out linking him to the sex attack . She was left with multiple injuries following the assault on October 6 and was saved only when three members of the public heard her cries and fought off the attacker. Simon Shannon, prosecuting, said the victim was out with friends for a birthday celebration and left the nightclub to catch a bus home. She was walking along the New Kent Road at 4am. ‘Before she knew what had happened she had been grabbed from behind,’ Mr Shannon said. Trimbitas dragged the victim into a stairwell, where he subjected her to a horrific assault while threatening to kill her. The attack was ‘extremely painful’, and the victim struggled to breathe, Mr Shannon said. When she screamed, Trimbitas shoved his hand into her mouth. It ended only when three passers-by intervened and one dragged Trimbitas off the woman. Scene: The woman was attacked while waiting for a bus on New Kent Road, near Elephant and Castle, south London, last month . He was traced from a shoe left at the scene. Police launched a manhunt across South London to identify him and eventually he handed himself in. Trimbitas admitted rape, sexual assault and making threats to kill. Judge Robinson said: ‘You were here little more than six months before committing this horrific crime.’ She said he was ‘so drunk and/or high on drugs’ that he could not remember the attack. ‘You inflicted serious injuries on this victim, both physical and psychological,’ she said. The court heard Trimbitas described his own actions as ‘beyond evil’. Labour politicians said that the case raised serious questions about border checks. Night out: The woman, 24, had spent the evening at the Ministry of Sound nightclub and was waiting for a bus home when she was attacked . Shadow immigration minister David Hanson said: ‘This was a horrific and needless attack as the man in question should never have been allowed back into the country. ‘The Government should make clear what they are doing to ensure something like this can never happen again.’ Detective Inspector Jackie Wakeford-Smith said the attack was ‘horrendous’ and ‘beyond words’. ‘I cannot rule out that he has not done this before. If you have been assaulted by Trimbitas, please come forward and tell us.’ A Home Office spokesman said the rapist will be deported at the end of his sentence. ‘Anyone coming to the UK must abide by our laws and EU citizens who commit crimes are liable to be removed,’ he added. ‘Marius Trimbitas has been found guilty of an appalling attack and is rightly behind bars.’ The spokesman said the Government was ‘starting the deportation process earlier and removing foreign criminals quicker than ever’. Since 2010, more than 17,000 offenders had been removed or deported, including 4,765 last year. He added that the Home Office has ‘close operational links with European police forces’ who share intelligence. Romanian and Polish officers are also seconded to provide intelligence and information on overseas convictions.","Marius Glad Trimbitas raped the woman, 24, in a stairwell in south London .

Eagle-eyed postman Robin Bamber, 50, took two pictures of burglar Matthew Taylor lurking in the street the morning after he had broken into his sleeping next door neighbour’s home and stolen a laptop, iPad and mobile phones. Taylor had targeted the house in Bolton-Le-Sands, Lancashire, in June after a friend told him he had successfully burgled another property there. In the frame: Robin Bamber helped put a burglar behind bars after spotting he was wearing gloves on a hot day and taking his photograph . Detectives, who had told neighbours to be vigilant following a spate of burglaries in the area, hailed Mr Bamber a 'hero'.

After Lady Mary’s husband died, Downton Abbey fans naturally focused on the young widow and the bachelors vying to woo her. But the growing bond between Carson and Mrs Hughes has offered hopes of a more mature romance, too – and the actors who play the two servants couldn’t be more delighted. Yesterday, Jim Carter and Phyllis Logan said the interest in their friendship proves viewers want to see characters falling in love later in life. Jim Carter as Carson and Phyllis Logan as Mrs Hughes: The actors are said to be delighted that they are to have an on-screen romance . Miss Logan, 57, who plays housekeeper Mrs Hughes, said there should be more such storylines on television. ‘As a person of a certain age – regardless of whether you’re a man or a woman – it would be nice to think that we’re not just confined to being “old”, but that we still have options to play a variety of emotions and parts,’ she said. And it seems viewers agree, as romantic plotlines between older characters are proving popular. The BBC scored a huge hit with Last Tango in Halifax, its recent drama about a romance between two widowed 70-somethings. Last month Anne Reid, 78, who plays Celia in the show, was honoured with an Older People in the Media Award for her role. Carter, 65, who plays the butler in Downton, said he was a big fan of Last Tango in Halifax: ‘It’s brilliant – I absolutely love it.’ For Carson and Mrs Hughes, who are in charge of the Downton servants, friendship has blossomed over after-hours chats. And their endearing closeness has already seen them christened as the downstairs version of Lord and Lady Crawley. Carter, 65, said: ‘I think people are very affectionate towards Mr Carson and Mrs Hughes. ‘And because we have our lovely scenes where we meet up at the end of the day and share a sherry, and we’re the only people downstairs of equal status so we can share confidences, I think people are busily reading romance into that – and the whole thing’s about love stories, isn’t it?’ Meanwhile Miss Logan said she is  glad the cliche of young females being seduced by older males has started to die out. ‘I think people now realise how ridiculous that is,’ she said in an interview with Radio Times, adding that she was pleased when BBC1 drama Cranford gave older characters interesting love lives. ‘[Cranford] had Eileen Atkins, Judi Dench, Imelda Staunton,  Barbara Flynn, Deborah Findlay, Julia McKenzie. Jim Carter, who plays Carson has said that he thinks people are very affectionate towards his character and Mrs Hughes . ‘They were up there in the front, and love’s young dream was pushed into the corner. That was successful and people enjoyed that.’ Last Christmas, Downton’s writers left fans distraught after one of the show’s best-loved romances, between Lady Mary and her husband Matthew Crawley, was cut short.

The likes of Amazon (webpage, pictured) are now warning that any orders will not be fulfilled until after Santa and his reindeer have long finished their rounds . While most high street stores have also put up ‘sold out’ signs, with little or no expectation of getting extra stock before Christmas. The huge demand is surprising, given the cost of living squeeze and fact that the devices are not cheap – Microsoft’s Xbox one comes in at £429.99 and Sony’s PS4 is £349. Some who managed to get hold of a console in the early rush following their release in the last two weeks are trying to cash in on the angst of parents, desperate not to disappoint their children. The Xbox One console, which comes with the Fifa 14 or Forza Motorsport game, was being advertised on eBay today with a ‘buy now’ price of up to £699 – a mark-up of £270 or 63per cent. Similarly, one eBay seller was trying to get as much as £850 for the latest PS4 console, which would be a mark-up of £501 or 143 per cent.

The firm’s product director, Haydn Simpson, said: ‘Consumers must remain wary of ""too good to be true offers"" for the must-have festive gifts.’ Amazon’s message to customers about the two consoles reads: ‘Temporarily out of stock’.

Similarly, the Xbox One product page has been updated to say the console will not be in stock until January 7. The UK marketing director for Xbox, Harvey Eagle, said: ‘Everyone knows demand for Xbox One is through the roof, we are doing everything we can to make sure our fans have an Xbox One.’ However, Yusuf Mehdi, the corporate vice president of strategy and marketing for Xbox, admitted the console has sold out in retailers around the world. ‘Demand is far exceeding supply in the 13 countries we’ve launched and we are sold out at retailers around the world,’ he said.

YouTube is awash with people parodying Miley's moves and the MailOnline previously reported how it has sparked a fitness craze with people keen to tone up with a 'twerk out'. But while the former Disney star may be credited with the recent revival of the bent over, derriere-jiggling move, a yoga instructor has revealed that it can be traced back centuries before the 20-year-old started shaking her booty. Causing controversy: Miley Cyrus twerks with Robin Thicke at the VMAs . Barbara Purcell, 33, told the Daily Express: 'Although twerking can be traced back as . far as 20 years in pop and hip hop culture, its roots may very well rest . in the ancient traditions of yoga from thousands of years ago. 'The word most likely comes from the . words work and twist. The combination creates a sexually charged dance . move with thrusting hips and low squatting stance.' Centuries-old: Miley sparked a new trend for twerking but a yoga instructor said the move belonged to them first . Barbara, who runs yoga classes in New York, said it's been a 'no brainer' to include the move in her sessions recently. Not only because it's what the Miley-inspired customers want, but because she said it works so well as a yoga move by engaging the chakra. She explains: 'Yoga teaches an energy system within the . body involving various energy points known as chakras. They basically . move from our root, up the spine, to the crown. 'Lower chakra work with a bit of a twerk which is a sexually-charged move really helps this area - and it's proven very popular so far.' Barbara Purcell said twerking works well as a yoga move because it engages the chakra . Barbara isn't the only fitness instructor to start incorporate twerking into her classes. Les Mills, creator of fitness programmes including Bodypump, told MailOnline earlier this month how it received a number of requests for a class featuring twerking moves following the VMAs. They adapted their existing Bodyjam class to incorporate a number of energetic twerking moves and are even considering changing the class's name to the Twerkout. Place your hands on your hips, with your feet turned out and your knees over your toes . To go forward, press your thumbs into your butt bone and move forward . To go back, the fingers pull back on the hip bone . Squat so that the only part of your body you can move is the hip section . For a more pronounced twerk, rest the hands on the knees, with the wrists facing out . Then up the tempo and shake the butt . Directions provided by HowCast . And it's not just in the pop and fitness world that twerking is taking off. The Oxford Dictionaries Online recently added the word with the definition: 'The twerk, v.: dance to popular music in a sexually provocative manner involving thrusting hip movements and a low, squatting stance.' Katherine Connor Martin, from Oxford Dictionaries Online, said 'twerk' was around 20 years old and was coined as part of the 'bounce' hip-hop scene in the U.S. 'By last year, it had generated enough currency to be added to our new words watch list, and by this spring, we had enough evidence of usage frequency in a breadth of sources to consider adding it to our dictionaries of current English,' she said recently. 'There are many theories about the origin of this word, and since it arose in oral use, we may never know the answer for sure. She added: 'The current public reaction to twerking is reminiscent in some ways of how the twisting craze was regarded in the early 1960s, when it was first popularised by Chubby Checkerâ€™s song, the Twist. Only time will tell if twerking will similarly be embraced by the general public.'","Pop star did provocative twerking dance at VMAs .

The last time Kate Winslet looked this bedraggled she was playing Alan Rickman’s bride in Sense And Sensibility – the role that catapulted her to international stardom. But the actress didn’t exactly look overjoyed when she joined forces with him again to shoot scenes for new film A Little Chaos last week. With her hair lank and unstyled, and wearing a loose-fitting blue dressing gown, her image certainly fitted the film’s title. A Little Chaos tells the story of two rival landscape gardeners  in 17th Century France vying for the favour of King Louis XIV for the chance to design a new fountain at his Versailles palace. The movie, which has taken five years to bring to the big screen, also stars Belgian actor Matthias  Schoenaerts. It does not look as if director Rickman, 67, is asking Kate to revive  the glamorous roles she played in Titanic and The Holiday. The project marks a return to work for Kate, 37, who has been enjoying something of an extended honeymoon since her December marriage to third husband Ned Rocknroll, 34, the nephew of Virgin tycoon Sir Richard Branson. The couple wed in New York with the bride given away by her Titanic co-star Leonardo DiCaprio. Kate has a daughter Mia, 11, from her first marriage to production assistant Jim Threapleton, and a son Joe, nine, with her second husband,  Skyfall director Sam Mendes.

A teenage girl who has twice been on the brink of death has overcome her troubled past to become one of Britain's Olympic hopes. Monique Newton, 19, battled brain cancer when she was a child, then went on to survive an attempted overdose at the age of 15. Now the London-born athlete has triumphed over adversity to become a world champion power-lifter and is tipped for success at this summer's Olympic Games. Fighting fit: Monique Newton battled back from brain cancer and a suicide attempt to become one of the world's best powerlifters . At just 48kg (7st 8lb), the petite teenager, who can currently seen on billboards as part of adidas' 'London - take the stage'  campaign, can lift the equivalent of three times her bodyweight above her head. Monique, from Fulham, was diagnosed with ganglio neuroblastoma at the age of three. The disease reached stage four, the most serious stage, and her family was informed that she would be confined to a wheelchair within a year, and dead within two. Months of debilitating chemotherapy and radiotherapy followed - and against all odds, Monique survived. But after battling back to health, Monique's struggles were not over. As a teenager, she fell in with the wrong crowd, and following arguments with her parents, she left home aged just 15. Suffering from depression and isolated from her family, Monique took an overdose of paracetamol. Fortunately she was discovered in time and was rushed to hospital to have her stomach pumped. After finally conquering her depression, Monique went to college and found work as an engineer. Her ordered new life gave her the space to take up powerlifting - and she found she excelled at the sport. 'I took up powerlifting because I wanted to do something where I would be the underdog and have to push myself to get to the top,' she told Metro. Monique has now won twice at the British and world powerlifting championships, and has triumphed at 18 of her 19 tournaments to far, including a second world championship in Latvia. Although she is now fighting fit, . Monique says her family still see her as the delicate girl she once was. 'The other day, when I was helping my aunt carry her shopping home, she . didn't even want me to carry some of the bags - she thought they would be too heavy for me' . 'It makes me feel happy to know I can use my story to help people who are or will be in a similar situation,' she said. 'Now I look back I'm so glad I am still here today,' she added.

'I had a feeling he was going to . eventually, one day, do something stupid, but not of this magnitude,' he . said, adding that he once threatened to kill him. Michael Hill, 20, slipped into the school on Tuesday afternoon behind a parent who was buzzed in through the locked doors.

The shooting resulted in no injuries, but the incident . nonetheless recalls the horrifying massacre last December at Sandy . Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in which a lone gunman . with an assault rifle killed 20 students and six teachers before taking . his own life. Ms Tuff may very well have prevented similar tragedy at McNair Academy. 'He had a look on him that he was willing to kill - matter of fact he said it. He said that he didn't have any reason to live and that he knew he was going to die today,' Ms Tuff told WSB-TV. 'I knew . that if he got out that door he was gonna kill everybody.'

As officers began arriving at the school, he fired at least six shots at them from the office. Police returned fire. No one was hit in either exchange of gunfire.

WSB-TV reports that the school has a buzzer system that limits access to outsiders, but that that Hill may have slipped in behind a parent who was walking into the building. The students had to be evacuated through the back of the elementary school because police were concerned that the gunman's car could be rigged to explode and kill students if they fled through the front exit. Firefighters cut a hole in fencing at the back of the school property that students had to run through to escape the school.

Executed: William Happ, seen in this undated photo, was executed on Tuesday using an untried drug . A Florida man convicted of raping and murdering a 21-year-old woman in 1986 made a shock confession moments before he was executed by lethal injection of a controversial, never-before used drug. Facing 17 members of his victim's family, William Happ, 51 - the first death row inmate to be injected with the drug midazolam hydrochloride - told those gathered to watch his death: 'For 27 years, the horrible murder  of Angela Crowley has been clouded by . circumstantial evidence and uncertainty. 'For the sake of . her family, loved ones and all concerned, it is to my agonising shame . that I must confess to this terrible crime.' Chris Cowley, the victim's brother, said the confession had come as a shock to his family. 'You need to ask somebody a lot more important than me for forgiveness,' he told Happ. Minutes later Happ blinked repeatedly and shook his head back and forth as he was executed. The drug was used despite concerns it might not work as promised and could inflict cruel and unusual punishment on the death row inmate. The execution began at 6.02pm at Florida State Prison in Starke. Happ's eyes opened and he blinked several times. He closed them and opened them again two minutes later. He then yawned and his jaw dropped open. At 6.08pm, the official overseeing the execution tugged at Happ's eyelids and grasped his shoulder to check for a response. There was none. Victim: Angie Crowley, pictured, was just 21 when she was kidnapped, raped and murdered by William Happ in 1986. Happ was executed on Tuesday . Happ appeared to remain conscious for a greater length of time and made more body movements after losing consciousness than people executed by the old formula which usually kills the prisoner within seven minutes. Midazolam, typically used by doctors for sedation, was the first of three drugs pumped into Happ as part of a lethal injection cocktail designed to induce unconsciousness, paralysis and death by cardiac arrest. The first of the drugs administered as part of the lethal injection 'protocol' in Florida has long been the barbiturate pentobarbital. But Florida and other death penalty states that use a trio of drugs as part of their injection procedures have been running out of pentobarbital since its manufacturer clamped a ban on its use in future executions. 'This is somewhat of an experiment on a living human being,' Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center in Washington, said Monday. Lethal dose: Happ was the first death row inmate to be injected with the drug midazolam hydrochloride, pictured, despite concerns it might not work as promised and could inflict undue pain . 'The three-drug process depends on . the first drug rendering the inmate unconscious and, if he is only . partially unconscious, the inmate could be experiencing extreme pain,' he added. 'Because the second drug paralyzes him, he would be unable to . cry out or show that he's in pain.' The . 51-year-old Happ, who had abandoned his appeals and said he was ready . to die, was condemned for the 1986 abduction, rape and murder of Angie . Crowley, whose body was found on a canal bank near Crystal River in . central Florida. Happ was . calm when he met with two spiritual advisers, including a Roman Catholic . priest who administered last rites, according to Department of . Corrections spokeswoman Jessica Cary. For his last meal, Happ had a 12-ounce box of assorted chocolates and 1 1/2 quarts of German chocolate ice-cream. 'To . my agonizing shame, I must confess to the crime,' he said in a slow, . deliberate voice before the injection was given. 'I wish to offer my . most sincere, heartfelt apology. I have prayed for the good Lord to . forgive me for my sins. But I understand why those here cannot.' Crowley's . mother and two siblings died before they could see the sentence carried . out, but Crowley's surviving sisters and brothers traveled to Starke to . watch as Happ was executed. Happ's lawyer, Eric Pinkard of St Petersburg, said there were no late motions to stay the execution. Happ told a circuit judge in Inverness, Florida, last month that he did not want to continue the court appeals that have kept him on Florida's death row for nearly a quarter-century. Another condemned Florida prisoner, Etheria Jackson, has a hearing set for a November 6 in Jacksonville's federal court, challenging the use of midazolam. Jackson's appeal contends that there is 'substantial risk' of midazolam not working completely, violating the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of 'cruel and unusual punishment' by subjecting the condemned to a painful paralysis and fatal heart seizure over several minutes. Angie Crowley was making her first long trip through Florida on Memorial Day weekend in 1986 but she never arrived at her destination. She prearranged with her friend to meet at a convenience store in Crystal River so she could be guided the last few miles of the trip. Crowley found the store, but before she could get to the pay phone, William Happ smashed her car window, kidnapped her. He beat her, raped her and strangled her with her pants before throwing her body into a canal. Protesters: Florida Highway Patrol cars frame protesters to the execution of William Happ, who was sentenced to death for the rape and murder of Angie Crowley in 1986, as they demonstrate across the highway from the Florida State Correctional facility near Starke on Tuesday . Crowley's brother Chris has pushed for years through an online petition and an email campaign to ensure Happ was executed for what he did to his sister. 'He killed my sister, he took her life. But when he took that life, he created so many other victims,' Crowley said. 'What he did affected everybody. It ate my mother up. I changed jobs and moved all within three months.' The murder shook Oregon, a small town about 40 miles southwest of Rockford, Illinois. Angie Crowley was a popular student at Oregon High School. After graduating, she attended Northern Illinois University before moving to Fort Lauderdale in December 1985. She worked as a travel agent to help pursue her dreams to travel the world. 'He took away the potential. There were seven kids in that family and she had the greatest potential of everybody. She had the personality, she had the looks, she had the smarts and she had the attitude. She really, really accomplished things and he took that,' Crowley said. 'We were never able to see it.' And the praise is not just because he's a loving brother. Angie Crowley's friends said she had a magnetic personality. She was a talented musician, honor student and a cheerleader with tons of friends. Always smiling, she never said anything bad about anybody. 'She was a sweetheart. Everybody just loved her, she had a great personality. She was prom queen, she was homecoming queen. She was just a gorgeous, gorgeous girl,' said Jim Kaufman, a classmate who visited Crowley in Florida just before her slaying. 'All of her classmates were devastated. Everybody in the whole town was. The whole town from young to older people knew her very well. She was very, very outgoing.' She was also a thoughtful friend who made great efforts to stay connected, said Sharon McBreen, who moved from Illinois to Florida in 10th grade. Not only did Crowley write long letters, but she mailed McBreen a senior yearbook signed by all her former classmates. Crowley's note in the book was two-pages long. 'She was just one of those really good friends who never missed your birthday. The card was always on time. She would write me six-page letters,' McBreen said. 'She would just write, front and back. She filled these letters with everything that was going on in town, and what she was thinking and what she wanted to do.'","William Happ, who killed and raped Angie Crowley, 21, in 1986, was pronounced dead at 6.16pm on Tuesday at Florida State Prison in Starke .

The artwork stand opened about midday with an inventory value estimated in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Each small to medium-sized canvas is worth at least $30,000. Yet over seven hours, just three people bought eight canvases - a total haul of $420. The first sale was at 3.30pm to a woman who bought two canvases for her children - and she managed to wrangle a 50 per cent discount. Half an hour later, a New Zealand woman purchased some art.

A top Obamacare executive behind the flawed roll-out of the health insurance website has stepped down. Tony Trenkle, the chief information officer for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, has resigned and will move into the private sector. CMS spokeswoman Julie Bataille sidestepped questions about the reasons for his departure or whether he was asked to resign. Tony Trenkle, chief information officer for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, has resigned . President Barack Obama defended Obamacare and said they would overcome the difficulties . She said he 'oversees all of our IT functions,' but declined to describe his role in the website or say whether he had been asked to leave. He is believed to have been part of the decision to issue a security certificate to the website before all the tests had been completed. This has led to major concerns about the security of people's data. His departure comes after mainly Republican Congress members called for the resignation of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius yesterday. The website, www.healthcare.gov, has been beset by problems since its launch. Users have reported long sign-in times, problems logging in, page load issues and crashes. During two hours in the Senate Finance Committee witness chair, Sebelius conceded the website launch was deeply flawed. Under-fire Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius faced calls for her to resign yesterday . She disclosed that the so-called punch list for repairs had included 'a couple of hundred functional fixes' at the time the administration launched its urgent rescue mission last month. Even now, she said, 'we're not where we need to be' and admitted the repairs may not be completed by the end of the month as promised. Sebelius admitted the latest bout of problems mean few people will be able to sign up. At a Dallas synagogue Wednesday, Obama assured volunteers that their efforts to sign people up for coverage would be well worth the trouble. 'As challenging as this may seem sometimes, as frustrating as HealthCare.gov may be sometimes, we are going to get his done,' Obama said. He added: 'This is like having a really good product in the store and the registers aren't working and not enough parking spots and no one can get in the door.' However, he was met by protestors outside the building who held up signs calling for him to be impeached and accusing him of lying. People protesting against Obamacare wait for President Barack Obama at Temple Emanu-El yesterday . Just before leaving Washington, Obama met with 16 Democratic senators facing re-election in 2014 to discuss the troubled website rollout. They pressed him to extend the March 31 enrollment deadline, but White House press secretary Jay Carney rejected the idea. Republicans said the administration put in jeopardy the personal information of Americans by taking the website live before security testing was fully completed. Federal law requires all government computer systems to have a security certification before going live. Yet on Sept. 27, Marilyn Tavenner, head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, agreed to a temporary permit that said, 'Aspects of the system that were not tested due to the ongoing development exposed a level of uncertainty that can be deemed as a high risk.'","Tony Trenkle, chief information officer for Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, has resigned .

'I've loved pigs since I was young and always said I was going to get one. So when I spotted an advert for micro pigs, I thought that would be perfect, he could live with us like a dog,' said Ms Dawes. Dudley is fully house trained and enjoys cuddling up to watch TV with his owner . Micro pigs are fully grown at two years old and weigh just two stone. So as Dudley continued to get bigger and bigger, it didn't take long for Ms Dawes to realise she'd been duped by the breeder. 'When we picked him up he was about nine weeks old and a bit bigger than I was expecting, but we saw his mother and she was pretty small. Obviously the dad must have been a lot bigger! Dudley as a piglet: After Ms Dawes bought the pig as a 50th birthday treat, she thought he would remain a small size forever. But as time went on she began to realise he wasn't a micro pig after all . 'We thought Dudley had reached full-size when he got level with the coffee table, but he kept getting bigger. 'Now, he comes up to my waist! I'm not sure of his exact weight but he must be at least 20 stone. 'He's certainly heavy. He stood on my toe the other week and it was black and blue! 'At first we were shocked by his growth, but we're used to it now. ""We did contact the breeder when we realised he wasn't 'micro' but we never got a response. 'It's probably just as well because by then we were too attached to part with him. Dudley, who is fully house trained, stays in the house during the day and sleeps in a coal shed in the garden at night, complete with a straw bed and heat lamp. Once she realised Dudley wasn't a micro pig after all, Ms Dawes contacted the dishonest breeder but received no response . Dexter, the household dog, has been feeling left out as Dudley attracts so much attention when stood out in the front garden . The pampered pig enjoys 'cuddling in and lying in front of the TV'. His favourite thing to eat are bananas, but he enjoys scoffing all types of fruit and veg. Dudley has made an unlikely friend in Dexter, the family's bichon frise. 'He's fully house trained, can give you a trotter when you ask and closes doors behind him. Though Ms Dawes and her Dexter are used to her unusual companion, Dudley still causes quite a stir around town. 'People think we're crazy having a huge pig in the house, but everyone who meets Dudley is smitten. Despite his surprising growth, Dudley is part of the family says Ms Dawes . 'We used to put him out in the front garden, but we'd have lines of school buses stopping outside and cars nearly crashing as the drivers were too busy looking at this huge pig running around,' she laughed. 'Now, he sticks to the back - but we still have people asking if they can meet our pet pig. 'Most have heard he loves bananas and bring a bunch along. 'The only thing we need to be wary of is shoelaces. He likes to chew them so you might end up with him accidentally nibbling your leg. 'But other than that he's a big friendly giant.'","Owners thought pet piglet wouldn't grow bigger than two stone .

Insistence: Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said the controversial HS2 line was the only way to tackle gridlock on Britain's rail network . There is no alternative to the controversial high speed HS2 project if Britain’s rail network is to avoid gridlock, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin insisted today. When asked by MP watchdogs if he was ‘completely satisfied‘ the £50billion line from London to Birmingham and beyond was the best option to increase capacity, he declared: ‘I am’. He said: ’Nothing else does the job as efficiently as HS2 will do.’ He also suggested he was open to appeals to start building ‘from the north’ towards the Midlands to fast-track the building process of the HS2 scheme. He said: ‘I get the message about people wanting to see it done faster.’ It was Mr McLoughlin’s first appearance before the Transport Select committee after publication of his 50,000 page HS2 Hybrid Bill on Monday. The document paves the way for work to start on the first phase from London to Birmingham - to be completed by 2026. Mr McLoughlin told the committee: ‘HS2 is vital to the economy and the future prosperity of the UK.’ He told MPs that HS2 was about creating more long-term capacity and connectivity  ‘not just about faster trains’. In future ‘everyone will wonder how we managed without it’. The 50,000 page report says the HS2 project will require demolition of 339 dwellings and 21 community facilities and destroy two areas of sites of special scientific interest (SSSI). It also says HS2 will require 2,500hectars of high-quality and 2,300hectrares of poorer quality agricultural land and will directly affect 18 Grade II listed buildings. The extent to which homes, the environment, beauty spots and local communities will be blighted is buried within the vast 50,000 pages of the new HS2 Bill . Campaigners - who have been given just 60 days to read the consultation report on HS2 - protest outside Parliament on Monday . It will also generate 128 million tonnes of excavated material and almost 5 million tonnes of waste to be disposed of to landfill. Some 67 dwellings will be ‘significantly affected by noise from the operation of the railway,’ it says. The Woodland Trust says HS2 between London and Birmingham will destroy 21 ancient woods. Asked what odds he would put on HS2 actually being completed, Mr McLoughlin said: ‘HS2 is absolutely essential so I'm 100% confident it is the right thing for the UK.’ Creating a conventional non-high speed line would still cost 90 per cent of HS2 project, so the extra marginal expense was justified, he said. There are: . MPs asked Mr McLoughlin if scrapping first class and lengthening trains and platforms on the West Coast mainline was a better way of spending the money. He said such measures would have only ‘a little impact for a little while’ and ‘would not provide us with a long-term solution’. On HS2 ticket prices he said: ‘We want fares to be competitive so that people can make the choice of either using the high-speed line or travelling by other routes.’ But he denied the Treasury had tried to ‘sabotage’ the scheme over spiralling costs, insisting he had the full support of Prime Minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne. The estimated cost of the full HS2 scheme - comprising phase one and phase two north of Birmingham - is £42.6 billion plus £7.5 billion for the trains. But Mr McLoughlin said he was confident the estimated £21.6billion figure for phase one could be reduced to £17.16 billion. Top City accountant authors of a Government-commissioned pro-HS2 report stood by their  sums that the high-speed rail scheme will generate £15 billion of economic benefit a year by 2037 – despite scepticism from critics who said it was ‘made up.’ KPMG’s infrastructure head Richard Threlfall rejected suggestions their report  had  ‘played down’ the areas of the country that  would lose out from HS2 compared with those that would benefit most, but noted: ‘It's inevitable that any large infrastructure project attracts a degree of controversy.’ Link: The project, estimated to cost around £50 billion, is intended to link London to Birmingham by 2026, with two branches then heading to Manchester and Leeds, via Sheffield, being built by 2033 . Lawyers for the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE)   have threatened legal action against the Government as  citizens are given fewer than 60 days over Christmas and New Year holidays to actually read the 50,000 page document it before consultation closes on January 24. The print copy fills around 20ft of book shelving tough Mr McLoughlin brandished a memory stick before MPs on which the entire volumes were available in digital form. Ministers deny acting illegally and stand by the  HS2 timetable. Labour backs HS2 but says PM David Cameron must ‘get a grip’ on ballooning costs while the TSSA rail union fears HS2 may become a ‘rich man’s toy’.","Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said he was 'completely satisfied' £50billion HS2 line was the best way to avoid gridlock on rail network .

A Romanian man who was the mastermind behind the theft of seven artworks by old masters has been jailed today. Radu Dogaru, 29, admitted being the driving force behind the three-minute heist at a Dutch museum during which he made off with paintings by Monet, Picasso and Lucien Freud. His driver, Eugen Darie, also admitted being part of the operation in October 2012. Both men, who were not in court, were sentenced to six years and eight months behind bars. Radu Dogaru, 29, (left) admitted being the mastermind behind an art heist last year along with his driver Eugen Darie (right). The duo were sentenced to six years and eight months each today . The duo earlier told the court that they thought they were stealing fakes at that security at the Kunsthal gallery in Rotterdam was very lax. While the exact fate of the paintings is unknown it is feared that Dogaru's mother, Olga, burned them in her oven in an attempt to destroy evidence against her son. The woman, who is currently on trial, allegedly admitted the act to police but later changed her story. 'Girl in Front of Open Window' was painted by Paul Gauguin in 1898 and was taken by Dogaru and Darie . Pablo Picasso's Harlequin Head (left) and Woman with Eyes Closed by Lucian Freud are among the works feared to have been burned by Dogaru's mother in her oven in an attempt to destroy evidence . Waterloo Bridge, London by Claude Monet was also taken from the Kunsthal gallery in Rotterdam . Another Monet, Charing Cross Bridge, London was also stolen in October last year by the gang . Ashes found in the oven were examined by forensic experts and was found to contain chemicals often used in 19th and 20th century paint, and what appeared to be nails from the frames. Triton Foundation, which owned the works, has reportedly been paid £14.7million ($23.8million) by their insurer despite some experts valuing the collection at up to £100million. Three other men are also due to stand trial in connection with the robbery on December 3. The fate of Self-Portrait by Meyer de Haan (left) and the 1919 work Reading Girl in White and Yellow by Henri Matisse has never officially been established, but it is likely they have been destroyed . Triton Foundation, which owned the works, has reportedly been paid £14.7m ($23.8m) by their insurer . The seven paintings stolen were Monet’s Waterloo Bridge and Charing Cross Bridge (both 1901), Picasso’s Harlequin Head (1971), Matisse’s Reading Girl In White And Yellow (1919), Lucian Freud’s Woman With Eyes Closed (2002), Gauguin’s Girl in Front of Open Window (1898) and Meyer de Haan’s Autoportrait (1890). The theft was one of the art world's most dramatic in recent years and one of the biggest ever to take place in the Netherlands. The Kunsthal exhibition, displaying a large part of the Triton Foundation's avant-garde collection for the first time in one gallery, opened just a few days before the heist to celebrate Kunsthal's 20th anniversary. This is the graveyard where Dogaru's mother Olga is thought to have buried the pictures before burning them . Ernest Oberlander-Tarnoveanu (left), manager of Romania's National History Museum and Gheorghe Niculescu (right), head of a team of investigative experts believe the paintings were destroyed in an oven . The Triton Foundation exhibition was showing works by more than 150 famed artists, including Alexander Calder, Paul Cezanne, Marc Chagall, Salvador Dali, Edgar Degas, Marcel Duchamp, Jasper Johns, Roy Lichtenstein, August Rodin, and Andy Warhol. The Kunsthal, meaning 'art gallery' in Dutch, is a display space that has no permanent collection of its own. The collection was put together by the Cordia family, which made its fortune in shipping and oil and which ranks among the 100 richest families in the Netherlands, according to Dutch media.","Radu Dogaru, 29, admitted being mastermind behind plot .

A study by a top university has claimed internet giant Google’s search facility 'perpetuates prejudices'. The investigation from Lancaster University found that results from Google’s auto-complete internet search tool produce suggested terms which could be viewed as racist, sexist or homophobic. The study by at team at Lancaster University’s Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences comes as a German federal court has told Google to clean up the results its search engine suggests. The re4sult of typing 'why do black' in Google in the UK reveals a list containing offensive answers . Typing 'why do gay people' into Google reveals this list which also includes offensive answers . Autocomplete is an automated system. As you type, autocomplete predicts and displays queries to choose from. The search queries that you see as part of autocomplete are a reflection of the search activity of all web users and the content of web pages indexed by Google. If you're signed in to your Google. The court has said Google must ensure terms generated by auto-complete, which represent the level of questions people are asking, are not offensive or defamatory. The FASS study found some shocking results in its UK study, which drew out more than 2,600 questions on the Google search tool and categorised the answers. And it warns that 'humans may have already shaped the internet in their image, having taught stereotypes to search engines.' The research revealed high proportions of negative evaluative questions for black people, gay people and males. For black people, these questions involved constructions of them as lazy, criminal, cheating, under-achieving and suffering from various conditions such as dry skin or fibroids. Searching for 'why do men' reveals the answers cheat, rape, go blind and get morning glory . Searching for 'why do women' also reveals offensive answers . Gay people were negatively constructed as contracting AIDS, going to hell, not deserving equal rights, having high voices or talking like girls. The negative questions for males positioned them as catching thrush, under-achieving and treating females poorly. A Google spokesperson said the system was entirely automated. 'Autocomplete is a feature of Google search that offers predicted searches to help you more quickly find what you’re looking for. ' The search queries that you see as part of autocomplete are a reflection of the search activity of all web users and the contents of web pages indexed by Google. Autocomplete predictions are algorithmically determined based on a number of factors (including popularity of search terms) without any human intervention. Google also allows people to ask for offensive terms to be removed from the service. Professor Baker’s said: 'It seems as though humans may have already shaped the internet in their image, having taught stereotypes to search engines and even trained them to hastily present these as results of ‘top relevance’. The US according to Google's auto-complete function . While it is disturbing to see negative questions appear for any social group, it is especially worrying to encounter them when they refer to groups who either constitute a minority or have been subject to oppression either now or in the past. The higher amounts of negative questions (both in terms of proportion and frequency) for black and gay social groups are thus a cause for particular concern.' The report recommends Google introduces a way for readers to flag up auto-complete suggestions as problematic. The study by at team at Lancaster University¿s Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences comes as a German federal court has told Google to clean up the results its search engine suggests . Examples of offensive auto-complete options include when typing 'why do black' suggestions of 'why do black people have big lips' or 'why do black people like chicken' are made. The phrase 'Why do gay' is met with a suggestion of 'why do gay people get AIDS'. Prof Baker said: 'Many websites offer the facility for Internet users to flag user-generated content as problematic by clicking on an icon. For example, in the video-sharing website YouTube (owned and operated by Google), people can comment on videos, and then readers can mark those comments with ‘agree’ or ‘disagree’. 'If enough people disagree with a comment, it is hidden and an additional link needs to be clicked on for it to be viewed.' Europe according to Google's auto-complete feature . The report concludes that advances, which have been put forward in order to improve or personalize people’s experience of the Internet by predicting the sorts of things that people will find interesting or want to search for, have unintended consequences which can result in the perpetuation of negative stereotypes about vulnerable social groups. Prof Baker said: 'Most people would probably not wish to ask Google about social group stereotypes. However, enough people are doing so to cause auto-complete algorithms to offer these questions. 'Should content-providers ‘protect’ their users or should they simply reflect the phenomena that people are interested in? 'And if content providers do choose to manually remove certain suggestions from auto-completion algorithms, who decides which suggestions are inappropriate?

When their grumpy teenager is in the throes of yet another sulking fit, most parents would give an awful lot to know what’s going on inside their head. And soon they’ll be able to – without resorting to a guilty peek in their diary. Scientists at Cambridge University have begun a £5.4million study to understand the workings of the teenage brain. Adolescent moods - personified by Harry Enfield's Kevin the Teenager (pictured) - will be studied by scientists . They will scan the brains of 300 participants, currently aged 14 to 24, over several years to see how they change as they grow older. Teenagers are typically impulsive, argumentative and sullen – as personified by Harry Enfield’s teenager Kevin, whose catchphrase is ‘it’s so unfair’. Ed Bullmore, a professor of psychiatry at Cambridge University, believes that the wiring of the brain gradually changes as teenagers approach adulthood, which eventually allows them to control their emotions and act less impulsively. ‘MRI scans will give us very good pictures of how the anatomy of the brain changes over the course of development,’ he told the BBC. ‘We are particularly interested in how the tissue at the centre of the brain, known as white matter, might change over the course of development.’ Professor Bullmore believes that changes to the white matter, the communication cables between brain cells, increase the mind’s ability to think ahead. He explained that changes to the brain’s wiring will be related to emotional, behavioural and cognitive changes. Cambridge University scientists will use MRI scans to see how the anatomy of the brain changes with age . These will be measured separately through tests which assess impulsive and risk-taking behaviour. Professor Bullmore said: ‘I think we are going to find that the decision-making process in the younger teenagers [is] more driven by short-term considerations, immediate emotional states, immediate past history of what was rewarding.’ One of the first to undergo the MRI scan was a 16-year-old who suffered from mood changes. The girl, known only as Samantha, said: ‘When I was about 15 or 16, that’s when I noticed the change the biggest. ‘Instead of being happy all the time I would be quite moody, angry, and I would have arguments. I just changed completely.’ Becky Inkster, a neuroscientist and project manager at Cambridge University, said: ‘Arguably we’ve all been there and it’s a very awkward and complex and confusing time of life. So to be able to express oneself is quite difficult. ‘So by the use of imaging and other tools we can really tap into these features of the adolescent brain and understand how they develop over time as they become a young adult.’ The study, funded by the Wellcome Trust, may also enable doctors to identify individuals at high risk of developing a psychiatric or drug dependence disorder. Professor Bullmore explained: ‘A lot of mental illness arises for the first time in adolescence or young adults and we think it’s often arising from an abnormal development of these kinds of brain networks.’","Cambridge University scientists will study the working of teenage brains .

'I'm going to weather this storm,' Mr Ford said. Mr Ford made his remarks on his local weekly radio show at a time when he is facing growing pressure to resign after police said they had obtained a copy of a video that appears to show him puffing on a crack cocaine pipe. Mr Ford didn't address the contents of the tape, saying he cannot comment on a tape he hasn't seen. Big talker: Toronto Mayor Rob Ford on his weekly radio show Sunday in Toronto . 'I just got to maybe slow down on my drinking,' Mr Ford said. Mr Ford acknowledged making 'mistakes' and that he can't change the past, but vowed 'to ride the storm out.' 'I want to move forward but to move forward I also have to make changes in my life which I will assure I will do,' Mr Ford said. Ford declined to take a leave of absence or resign. 'I sincerely apologize, there's absolutely no excuse, no one to blame but myself,' Mr Ford said. 'I am going to fight like no one has seen before to win the next election.' Ford said he shouldn't' have been drunk in public when he appeared at the Taste of the Danforth street festival in August. 'That was pure stupidity,' Mr Ford said. 'I shouldn't have got hammered down at the Danforth. If you are going to have a couple of drinks, you stay at home and that's it. You don't make a public spectacle of yourself,' Ford said. Still defiant: Despite mounting public outcry, from people such as this protester outside the radio studio, Mr Ford declined to resign . Mr Ford also said he got 'a little out of control' after St. Patrick's Day in 2012. A city spokeswoman released last week an incident report from city hall security guards who said they witnessed a 'very intoxicated' Ford having trouble walking and swearing at aides that day. The incident report said that at 2:30 a.m. on St. Patrick's Day, Mr Ford 'visited the security desk alone with a half empty bottle of St. Remy French Brandy.' The report states the mayor said his car had been stolen and that he wanted to call police. Security told Ford his car was at home and took the bottle from him before finding him a taxi. Mr Ford said you can't be 'running around with a half bottle of brandy' at City Hall at 2 a.m. Mr Ford met Saturday with Deputy Mayor Norm Kelly, who had said he wanted to express the concerns of city council members after news of the video emerged. Police on Thursday announced that the video had been recovered from a computer hard drive during an investigation of an associate of the mayor suspected of providing him with drugs. Allegations that Mr Ford had been caught on video smoking crack cocaine surfaced in May. Two reporters with the Toronto Star and one from the U.S. website Gawker said they saw the video but did not obtain a copy. Police Chief Bill Blair told a news conference Thursday that he was 'disappointed' in Ford but said the video did not provide grounds to press charges against him. Mr Ford told a woman who called into his show that she was a great mother for explaining to her kids that his behavior is not acceptable, but said 'I'm not resigning. I'm not going away.' All four major Toronto newspapers have called on Mr Ford to resign. Many city councilors and The Toronto Board of Trade have also called on him to step down. Mr Ford called on the police chief to release the video. 'Whatever this video shows, Toronto residents deserve to see it and people need to judge for themselves what they see on this video,' Ford said. He wants to run for reelection: Not only has Mr Ford declined to resign, he plans to run next year for a second term . Police said the video will come out when Mr Ford's associate and occasional driver, Alexander Lisi, goes to trial on drug and extortion charges. Mr Lisi, who was released on bail Friday morning, is accused of threatening two alleged gang members who had been trying to sell the video to the media. Police said they can't release the video because the case is pending before the court. The mayor is not facing any charges. However, police have said they want to talk to him, but his lawyer has so far declined the request. Municipal law makes no provision for Mr Ford's forced removal from office unless he's convicted and jailed for a criminal offense. Voters may have the final word in the October 2014 mayoral election, in which Mr Ford has said he plans to run.","Rob Ford admitted to drinking too much, but deflected questions about accusations of smoking crack cocaine .

Bill: Danny Alexander warned Scots could face a tax hit of more than £1,000 a year if they vote for independence . Scots face an income tax bombshell of more than a £1000 a year if they break away from the United Kingdom, the Treasury has warned. The stark message of the true cost of separation was set out by Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, in a letter to Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond. He warned that Scotland would have to find an extra £3 billion a year to plug the black hole in its finances if it became independent. It would amount to an eight percentage point rise in income tax for basic rate payers, taking their average tax bill up from £2,517 to £3,523 - an extra £20 a week. Only if Scotland came up with economic growth that was unseen in Europe for half a century could it avoid the tax rise. The damning finding deals a blow to the Scottish Government’s attempts to convince Scots of the case for independence as it prepares to publish its 600 page white paper making the case for independence today. But ahead of its publication, former Chancellor Alistair Darling, chairman of the pro-Union Better Together campaign, said: ‘If they ignore the cost of independence or claim that a vote by Scotland can force other countries into doing what Alex Salmond wants, it will be a work of fiction.’ Last week the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) published a report warning the basic rate of income tax in Scotland would have to rise from 20p to 28p or make massive public spending cuts. Scotland’s ageing population and the predicted drop in oil revenues could leave it facing spending cuts or tax rises of 1.9 per cent of its national income. A further analysis of the IFS figures will be issued by the Treasury today. In a letter to the Scottish First Minister, Mr Alexander said: ‘One week ago the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) projected that under independence Scottish public sector net debt could rise above 100 per cent of national income by the early 2030s and above 200 per cent of national income over 50 years. ‘This is not a sustainable position.  Even under the most optimistic scenario the IFS considered, in 2021-22 an independent Scotland could have to find permanent tax increases or spending cuts that would be equivalent to £3 billion in today’s terms. Treasury officials had calculated that . this would mean ‘an average increase for basic rate tax payers in . Scotland of around £1000 per year’. Report: The findings may deal a blow to the Scottish Government¿s attempts to convince Scots of the case for independence as it prepares to publish its 600-page white paper making its case today . An independent Scotland would also have to grow by around 4.2 per cent a year for the next half century to reduce its debt to the same share of national income as the UK. It is a growth rate that no European country has managed for the last 50 years, Mr Alexander said. In response to Mr Alexander’s letter, a spokesman for SNP Finance Secretary John Swinney said: ‘This rushed and panicky letter from Danny Alexander shows just how rattled the No campaign are by the launch of the White Paper and its positive vision for Scotland’s future. ‘The reality is the policies of his Tory-led Government have cost many ordinary Scots far more than £1,000 each since they came to office.’ Last night Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael issued a rallying call for non-Scots to make their voices heard in the independence debate. ‘I am eager to hear from people in Wales, Northern Ireland, Liverpool and Newcastle as well. It should not just be Scots saying they want to remain in the UK,’ he told the Mail. ‘There are more families than ever in Scotland that have family in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. These people do not want borders and barriers to be put up.’ Education Secretary Michael Gove said he would remain a politician at Westminster if Scotland voted to go independent. But he added: 'One of the things I'd find very difficult is accepting that the country which I grew up in, which defines my identity, was no longer part of the Union. 'It would be... a remarkable development when the identity with which we grew up had been shredded,' he told ITV's The Agenda.","Chief Secretary to Treasury wrote to Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond .

A London council has spent millions on sending homeless people to exclusive hotels because they cannot find anywhere to house them, it was claimed today. Westminster City Council officials allegedly approved four-star accommodation for those without homes because of a loophole in the benefit system. Council chiefs has racked up hotel bills worth thousands, including spending £248,000 on rooms at the Jurys Inn Hotel in Chelsea, London during January and February. A four star Jurys Innh as been used by the council to house homeless families - costing the taxpayer thousands of pounds . The council also books rooms ta the exclusive Copthorne Tara Hotel in Kensington, London . It also paid for one family to stay at a hotel at a cost of £27,000 during the first two months of this year, The Sun reported. Another extravagant spend was the council paying £171,000 on rooms at the Copthorne Tara Hotel near the exclusive Kensington Gardens in West London. It also books rooms at the Leinster House Hotel near Hyde Park at a cost of £133,000, a Freedom of Investigation request by The Sun found. Families are claiming they are homeless rather than moving to cheaper areas to dodge new laws that cap their housing benefit, experts told the newspaper. Many of the cases are believed to have been staying in hotels for months, despite strict laws saying people should only be in bed and breakfast accommodation for no more than six weeks. A councillor for Westminster City Council blamed a chronic shortage of housing across the capital . The Sun's investigation follows a BBC . report in February about the council's policy of using hotels when . homes could not be found. The council has said it is using . hotels because there is nowhere else for the homeless families to go and . it was trying to re-house the families. The BBC report showed the Osmans, a family of ten who had been put up in the Jury's Inn hotel, in Chelsea, since November, after they became homeless when they could no longer afford the rent on their four-bedroom house because of the benefit caps. It said the family's housing benefit had been £700 a week, but it was now costing nearly the same amount every night for them to stay in the hotel. Westminster City Council told The Sun that it was urgently seeking accommodation for the influx of homeless families, and once councillor blamed a chronic shortage of housing on the queue for homes. The council were unavailable to comment to MailOnline this evening. The revelaion comes after the Queen's Sppech included a Bill that will limit access to benefits, and clearer priority given to long-term local residents in social housing queues.","Families stay in four star hotels because Westminster City Council 'cannot find homes for them'

Roughly three years ago, Gabriel Carrillo went to Men's Central Jail to discuss his inability to visit his brother there. Instead, a Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputy handcuffed him, took him to a break room with no windows or public access, and threw him against a refrigerator, court documents say. His arm was fractured in the encounter and he received cuts to his nose and face, according to indictments unsealed yesterday. Afterward, four deputies tried to have him falsely charged with resisting an executive officer. Mr Carrillo was detained for about five days and before he was ultimately released without charge. Scroll down for video . Injuries: Gabriel Carrillo's face after he was . allegedly beaten by deputies at Men's Central Jail in Los Angeles - a . case which has led to the charges against 18 current and former jail . officers for allegations of abuse . The case was one among many allegations announced by federal officials as they charged 18 current and former Los Angeles County sheriff's officials with beating inmates and jail visitors, falsifying reports, and trying to obstruct an FBI probe of the nation's largest jail system. The investigation into corruption and civil rights abuses led to the arrests Monday of 16 of the 18 defendants. The 13 who were arraigned entered not guilty pleas. At least two no longer work for the department. 'These incidents did not take place in a vacuum. In fact, they demonstrated behaviour that had become institutionalised,' said U.S. Attorney Andre Birotte Jr. Mr Carrillo, of Bellflower, Los Angeles, said he thought the officers wouldn't stop until he was dead. 'I’m . in a room with all these cops just beating up on me,' he told CBS Los . Angeles. 'I blacked out and I thought the worst was going to happen, . where I’ll just end up dying in there.' 'I thought the worst was going to happen': Mr . Carrillo now. His attorney says the case was the genesis of an FBI probe . into abuse at Los Angeles County jails . Although he survived the ordeal, to add insult to injury, he was then slapped with charges of battery against his alleged attackers that would have carried a potential 14-year jail term. 'I've never seen such an outrageous abuse of the badge,' said Mr Carrillo's attorney, Ron Kaye. 'His hands were behind his back in handcuffs, he was visiting his brother, they sensed some disrespect from him and they decided to teach him some jailhouse punishment.' Mr Kaye says Mr Carrillo's case was the spark which led to the probe into the abuse at Men's Central Jail, which has led to four grand jury indictments and one criminal complaint involving corruption and civil rights charges. Flanked by some of his top command staff, LA County Sheriff Lee Baca yesterday told reporters that he was troubled by the charges and called it a sad day for his department. He said the department would continue to cooperate with the FBI and that deputies who have been charged would be relieved of duty and have their pay suspended. The Sheriff's Department oversees a jail system with more than 18,700 inmates and has a history of abuse allegations dating back to the Seventies. These most recent allegations include: .

Those charged with conspiracy and obstruction of justice include two lieutenants, one of whom oversaw the department's safe jails program and another who investigated allegations of crimes committed by sheriff's personnel. They're accused along with two sergeants and three deputies with trying to prevent the FBI from contacting an informant by falsifying records to appear that he had been released when he had been moved to different cells under false names. Attorney General Mr Birotte wouldn't say whether the lieutenant and two sergeants in the obstruction of justice probe were directed by their superiors or whether the alleged abuse was fostered by top brass at the department. Sheriff Baca, who has been in the job since 1998, is facing his toughest race yet for re-election in 2014. He has acknowledged mistakes but also defended his department and distanced himself personally from allegations. The sheriff said he has made improvements such as creating a database to track inmate complaints. He has also hired a new head of custody and rearranged his command staff.

The organisation released a report documenting more than 70 cases of misconduct by deputies. The Citizens' Commission on Jail Violence, in its 2012 report, said deputies used force against inmates even 'when there was no threat at all,' and referred to 'a culture of aggression among some deputies in the jails.' A federal jury in October found Sheriff Baca personally liable for $100,000 for failing to stop inmate abuse by deputies in Men's Central Jail in a case brought by a man who said he was severely beaten while awaiting trial. In June, a two-year Justice Department investigation found deputies discriminated against blacks and Latinos by making unconstitutional stops, searches, seizures and using excessive force in the Antelope Valley. Sheriff Baca disputed the findings but said he had instituted reforms.","Gabriel Carrillo allegedly beaten after asking why he couldn't see his brother .

One of the three women allegedly held as a slave by a Maoist sect in south London is the daughter of one of the greatest Bletchley Park codebreakers, it has emerged. The father of Josephine Herivel, 57, was John Herivel, who was instrumental in deciphering the Nazis' Enigma code during World War Two. But by the time he died two years ago, she was apparently estranged from the family after becoming a radical Leftist in the 1970s and being arrested for assault. Scroll down for video . Family: Josephine Herivel, left, one of the women allegedly imprisoned by a Maoist cult, is the daughter of Bletchley Park codebreaker John Herivel, right . Reports suggest that last week's arrests of suspect Aravindan Balakrishnan and his wife Chanda in Brixton were triggered when Ms Herivel raised the alarm. The couple were arrested on suspicion of assault, false imprisonment and immigration offences amid claims that three women were held against their will for more than 30 years. The women are set to be formally interviewed by police today - officers have already had indirect contact with the trio, but had to wait until trauma experts gave them permission to talk to them in person. Commander Steve Rodhouse said: 'We have not yet been able to formally interview the victims in this case so we don't fully understand the nature of the allegations. 'We are moving to a point where we will be able to interview the victims and our plan is actually to do so today. 'The victims are in the care of specialists who have got great experience of dealing with people who have been subject to trauma. We're working to that advice of those experts as to how best to handle those victims, to support them and of course to draw out the evidence we would need to substantiate any prosecution.'

He said that there may have been 'many . and varied offences' against the women, who were allegedly held captive . at various addresses in London, but that their ordeal may not be defined . as slavery. Ms Herivel was brought up near Belfast’s so-called 'millionaire row' with her two sisters, Mary and Susan. Her . father John, a brilliant mathematician, was recruited from Cambridge .

After being . trained on how to break the German Enigma machine cipher by Alan Turing, . the 21-year-old Sidney Sussex College student devised a method of . codebreaking that became known as the Herivel Tip.

He and his wife Elizabeth, who also worked at Bletchley, later retired to Oxford, where he became a fellow of All Souls College in 1978. In the same year Josephine, then 22, was arrested for assault and obstructing police in London along with a number of young women who were part of the same revolutionary sect run by Balakrishnan, known as 'Comrade Bala'. When her father died in 2011 obituaries only made mention of his two other daughters, who now live in London. Attempts by her family to make contact failed, according to family friend Frances Presley. She told The Times: 'They have tried to contact her for years.

Named: TV presenter and former footballer John Fashanu has appeared on a database of people linked to tax havens . A raft of high-profile Britons and organisations - including a former England footballer, a professor of medicine and a government trade adviser - have been revealed to have links to off-shore tax havens in a database leaked to HM Revenue & Customs. They include ex-footballer John Fashanu and Alpesh Patel, a former Financial Times columnist who now advises UK Trade and Investment, as well as leading banks and financial institutions, including Goldman Sachs and Coutts, according to the Sunday Times. The cache of 2.5m leaked documents, which was revealed to HMRC as it clamps down on wealth sheltered in tax havens, relate to the activities of companies and people in countries with low tax including Singapore, the British Virgin Islands (BVI) and the Cook Islands (CI). It is thought the documents have been handed in stages to HMRC and authorities in America and Australia by a whistleblower since 2009, prompting a global investigation into alleged tax evasion. One of the more unusual names on the list, which was separately obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, is Robert Stockley, a professor of medicine at University Hospital Birmingham. Documents connected Mr Stockley, 63, a lung disease expert, to two BVI-incorporated companies, Brinko Test Ltd and International Criminal Resources, in turn linked to an account at the FirstCaribbean International Bank. Professor Stockley said he had volunteered information about the firms to HMRC in the course of 'sorting my tax affairs'. Following negotiations he paid about £16,000 in extra tax. Robert Stockley, a professor of medicine at University Hospital Birmingham, has been connected with two companies in the British Virgin Islands . The professor said ICR was a non-profit making entity for resource projects. He said he set up Bronko Test with an American partner to handle earnings, amounting to just thousands of pounds, from a lung testing chart they had invented. The firm was transferred to the UK in 2008. Although conceding the Caribbean territory was a well-known tax haven, Professor Stickley denied taking any dividends from the BVI company, saying: 'Our advice from accountants was that this was quite useful. I started to feel a bit uncomfortable, which is why we split it up and got it registered in the UK.' He added HMRC 'knows everything' and that money has been declared and dues paid and signed up. Mr Fashanu, 50, a former Premier League footballer for Wimbledon, was named on the list as a director of a telecommunications company set up in the BVI by a Nigerianm tycoon in 2003. The now-TV presenter's manager, Ian Wilson, said his client was enlisted to the venture only as a 'figurehead' and that the firm, Communication Trends Network Ltd', had folded with heavy losses. Star: Fashanu celebrates a goal with his Wimbledon teammates in 1993 . 'He neither put any money in, nor did he take any money out,' Mr Wilson said of Mr Fashanu, who has been domiciled in Nigeria since 2006 for tax reasons. Mr Fashanu has not been contacted by HMRC. Mr Patel, who runs an asset management firm with offices in Mayfair, London, said he received a letter from HMRC three years ago in which the authorities said they believed he had offshore assets. Documents from the BVI show the 41-year-old set up a company called AHM Investors in 2005, which was listed as 'dormant' the following year. He told the Sunday Times that 'it never got off the ground; it never traded' and said the mindset of many financial firms had changed since the 2008 economic crisis, before which they would have set up 'tax efficient' offshoots in places such as the BVI 'without thinking'. 'They didn't put much of a moral layer on it then,' he said. Goldman Sachs and Coutts bank also appeared on the data base . The list being trawled by HMRC also named 200 accountants and advisers. A source at Goldman Sachs told the paper it may have appeared because it had acted n instructions from a client to move assets into an offshore trust and said it had not been contacted by HRMC. Coutts, named in relation to its operations in the Isle of Man, said it was 'fully committed to an open and transparent regulatory environment in all jurisdictions'. There is no suggestion any of the companies if individuals banned have broken the law.","Broadcaster and former footballer John Fashanu on list .

India's launch of a space craft is proof it no longer needs British aid, campaigners have claimed. Delhi’s orbiter mission – part of a £600million space programme – blasted off this morning with an orbiter which will survey Mars. But the TaxPayers’ Alliance said it was wrong for a country to explore other planets while receiving UK aid, in India’s case £280million a year until 2015. Lift off: A screen grab of live footage taken from Indian television channel NDTV during its coverage of the launch .

From a distance: A photographer captures the 1,350-kilogram (3,000-pound) orbiter as it heads into space . ‘It’s atrocious that taxpayers are still handing money to a country rich enough not just to have its own space programme, but one that is blasting off to Mars,’ said Jonathan Isaby, the group’s political director. ‘If India can afford this kind of expenditure then it does not need a penny of British taxpayers’ money, especially when departments back home rightly have to cut their spending. ‘It’s difficult for taxpayers to believe the Department for International Development uses their cash wisely when they see it spent helping launch spacecraft to the red planet, rather than going to the world’s poorest.’ Ministers are committed to increasing overall aid spending by 30 per cent to £11.3billion this year and are expected to hit their target of spending 0.7 per cent of national income on aid. Anticipation: Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Chairman Koppillil Radhakrishnan (right) watches the launch from mission control in the island of Sriharikota . Nerves: Visitors to the Nehru Planetarium in Mumbai watch the live broadcast of the launch . Bystanders: Customers in a TV showroom take a break from their shopping to watch coverage of the launch . Unlike spending on policing, prisons . and defence, which have been slashed to cut the deficit, the aid budget . has enjoyed year-on-year increases. By next year, the bill will be £12.6billion a year – more than the £12.1billion spent on policing. But a recent poll found more than 60 per cent of voters believe the cash is wasted. India . spends vast sums on defence and even has its own overseas aid . programme, which cost £328million a year. Under Labour, India became the . biggest net recipient of British aid, receiving £421million in 2010. Despite . the country’s rapid economic development, then international . development secretary Andrew Mitchell decided to approve a further . £1.1billion in aid over the following four years. Demonstrations: Guests at the planetarium look at the rocket's planned trajectory . Preparations for launch: Engineers making their final preparations before the launch . If the rocket reaches Mars, India will become only the fourth country or group to reach the red planet after Russia, U.S. and Europe . Last year his successor Justine Greening announced the outlays would end in 2015. India’s . then finance minister Pranab Mukherjee embarrassed the Government by . suggesting Britain’s aid payments were ‘a peanut in our total . development expenditure’. If . successful, the space mission will put India in an elite group of four, . with the US, the EU and Russia, to have sent space craft to Mars. The . mission follows the launch of a lunar craft in 2008. Jean . Drèze, a leading development economist, has said: ‘It seems to be part . of the Indian elite’s delusional quest for superpower status.’ A . spokesman for the Department for International Development said: ‘Not a . penny of British taxpayers’ aid money has gone on India’s space . programme. 'India’s recent progress means that all . financial grants from the UK to India will cease in 2015, after which we . will focus on providing help in the form of private sector expertise . and technical assistance that will also ultimately benefit British . businesses and jobs.' Nigeria – another country with a space programme – also receives UK aid, worth £300million this year alone. China's Shenzhou-10 rocket blasts off from the Jiuquan space centre in June . India's bid to be the first nation since Russia, the U.S. and the EU to reach Mars could spark an Asian space race. Experts say its ambitious space programme has been fuelled by competition with China and concerns about its neighbour's civilian and military space technology. ‘The reality is that there is competition in Asia. There's the angle of the potential space race,’ said Rajeswari Pillai Rajagopalan, senior fellow at the Observer Research Foundation. Although India's programme is largely for peaceful purposes, it has increasingly realised the need to grow its deterrence capability after China's 2007 anti-satellite missile test. ‘That was a wake-up call for India,’ said Rajagopalan. ‘Until then we were taking it easy.’ China's space programme is far ahead of India's, with bigger rockets, more launches and equally cost-effective missions. It is working to create a space station and in June sent a manned rocket - the Shenzhou-10 - to the Tiangong (Heavenly Palace) 1, a trial space laboratory module. Both Chinese and Indian launches have been carefully staged to boost national pride. President Xi Jinping told the astronauts: 'You are the pride of the Chinese people, and this mission is both glorious and sacred.' India's mission was announced on the country's Independence Day last year, soon after China's bid to reach Mars failed. Dr James Clay Moltz, professor at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School, told CNN: 'I believe India's leadership sees China's recent accomplishments in space science as a threat to its status in Asia, and feels the need to respond.' However officials have dismissed the suggestion that India raced to prepare Tuesday's launch to trump China's failed attempt at Mars. ‘We're not in a race with anybody,’ said ISRO spokesman Deviprasad Karnik, noting that the voyage can happen only every 26 months, when the spacecraft can travel the shortest distance between Earth and Mars. ‘The mission to Mars has to be organised whenever there is an opportunity available.’","Aim is to see if India has the ability to explore the solar system .

An unflappable President Barack Obama is facing increased pressure as his signature legislative achievement hobbles under the weight of unmet goals and lowered expectations . The Obamacare website's performance in November showed improvement over October's dismal start, but the total number of Americans taking advantage of the Affordable Care Act is less than half what the Obama administration projected. And President Obama's top cheerleaders are showing cracks in their armor, with the Health and Human Services secretary advising consumers in a USA Today essay to use healthcare.gov during 'off-peak hours.' 'Please do not give up,' Secretary Kathleen Sebelius pleaded. The Department of Health and Human Services set an Obamacare enrollment target of 800,000 by the beginning of December. So far, according to published estimates, it has reached between 300,000 and 350,000. Bloomberg reported Monday morning that when government releases the final numbers for healthcare.gov in November, it will hover at around 100,000. And NBC News reporter Chuck Todd tweeted two hours later that the nationwide total would reach '200-250K w/states.' That larger number would include the Obamacare enrollments from the 14 states, plus the District of Columbia, that are running their own insurance exchanges. In October, just 26,794 people signed up for health insurance plans via the federal government's online portal. Another 79,391 enrolled through the state-based websites. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Not ready for off-peak hours? CNN early morning medical producer Matt Sloane couldn't get coverage through healthcare.gov, just as the government was announcing that the website was new and improved . Sometime in 2017: David Plouffe, a long-time former senior adviser to President Obama, said Sunday that the Affordable Care Act might only function properly years from now . If the published estimates are correct, a best-case scenario for the White House would see a national total of about 356,000 enrollments. In addition to falling short of the administration's two-month projection, that number is just 5.1 per cent of the 7 million sign-ups the White House needs by the end of March in order to ensure the program's solvency for the first year. Meanwhile, more than one-third of the enrollment period has already elapsed: Americans who want government help to obtain coverage for 2014 have until March 31 to apply and select plans. Those who want their coverage to begin on January 1 have just two weeks left to enroll. The Obama administration expects enrollment rates to increase significantly as the March deadline approaches. David Plouffe, a long-time former Obama senior adviser – now an ABC News contributor – told network host George Stephanopoulos . on Sunday that the Affordable Care Act will 'work really well' when all . 50 states are running their own health care exchanges and have fully . expanded Medicaid. 'It may take until 2017 when this president leaves office,' he said. But 'it'll work really well then.'

'While we strive to innovate and improve our outreach and systems for reaching consumers, we believe we have met the goal of having a system that will work smoothly for the vast majority of users,' the report from HHS read.

Thousands of protesters took to the street of Bankok in Thailand today despite the Prime Minister announcing a snap election to try and calm the unrest. Leader Yingluck Shinawatra's party is likely to win the contest, which she hopes will cool political tensions without the need for her to bow to demonstrator's demands for leadership change. However activists say they will not participate in another ballot, and insist that Yingluck must leave office before they stop the rallies which brought 140,000 people onto the streets today. Scroll down for video . Around 140,000 people took to the streets in Bangkok today where protests have raged for more than a month calling for Yingluck to stand down . Democrat MPs resigned en masse in protest on Sunday at the ruling party's dominance of parliament . Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra has announced a snap election as she tries to stop anti-government protests in the capital Bangkok . Yingluck is commonly seen as a pawn for her brother Thaksin who was exiled in 2008 after parties backing him won every election for almost a decade . The 'yellow shirt' activists are made up of the middle-classes, the royalist elite, and the military and are pitted against the working class 'red shirts' who support Thaksin . The activists have stormed government buildings and clashed with police in the past few weeks in their attempts to set up an unelected 'People's Council' to reform the country's laws before holding fresh elections. Yingluck's Puea Thai party have said she is likely to be their candidate for the election which will take place on February 2. Addressing a cheering crowd from a newly-erected stage near the government headquarters, protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban announced plans to set up a parallel government and told supporters they should be prepared to set up camp at the site. Protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban spoke to demonstrators today and said there would be no end to the rallies until Yingluck was gone from power . He is calling for an end to the democratic system in the country and a 'People's Council' to be established which would reform laws before holding fresh elections . So far five people have been killed and 100 injured after police clashed with the political activists . Last week officers used tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannons in an attempt to disperse protesters . Royalist anti-government protesters hold up a portrait of King Bhumibol Adulyadej and a placard reading 'We don't need Thaksin regime' 'We will select a people's prime minister and set up a government of the people and a people's assembly to replace parliament,' said Suthep, who faces an arrest warrant for insurrection. So far five people have died and 100 have been injured in clashes in with police who used tear gas, rubber bullets, and water cannons to disperse activists throwing rocks. Yingluck is unpopular because she is seen as a pawn for her brother, . Thaksin, who once described her as his 'clone'. Thaksin is a businessman-turned-politician who was exiled from the country . following a revolution in 2008 after being convicted of corruption - a charge he says is politically motivated. The unrest has brought parts of Bangkok to a standstill as the yellow shirts push for revolution . The yellow shirts are opposed to another election which will favour the current government . Protests began after Yingluck tried to pass an amnesty bill, seen by critics as a way to bring Thaksin back . Thaksin is in exile to avoid jail for a corruption sentence which he claims was politically motivated . Experts have predicted more violence if the yellow shirts are successful as the red shirts are likely to protest . Pro-Thaksin parties have . won every election in more than a decade, while the opposition Democrat . Party - whose MPs resigned en masse Sunday - has not won an elected . majority in about two decades. The protest started after Yingluck tried to pass an amnesty bill which critics of the government saw as paving the way for Thaksin's return. The conflict has pitted the . middle classes, the royalist elite, and the military - known as 'yellow . shirts' - on one side, against working class 'red shirts' and supporters . of Thaksin on the other. 'If . this government is deposed, it will be an outcome of a so-called . 'people's coup' by the electoral minority,' said Thailand expert . Thitinan Pongsudhirak. Dozens of red shirts were killed in a crackdown while demonstrating against the last government . Parts of the city centre have been virtually closed down by protesters as they march down the highways . While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful a few have turned violent . The country has been in political turmoil since 2006 when there was a military coup . The violence had only a brief respite last week when both sides paused to celebrate the birthday of the nation's revered king, who turned 86 on Thursday . 'We will see more polarisation - and the makings of a prolonged civil conflict,' added Thitinan, director of the Institute of Security and International Studies at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University. Dozens of people were killed in a military crackdown on mass pro-Thaksin Red Shirt rallies in Bangkok three years ago against the previous government. If Yingluck is overthrown, 'we will see most likely the return of the Red Shirts to Bangkok and when they unleash their wrath this time it will be much more cataclysmic than what we saw in the uprising in 2009-2010,' Thitinan added.","Around 140,000 protesters took to the streets of Bangkok today .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 04:51 EST, 21 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:43 EST, 21 August 2013 . A young woman suffers with an incredibly rare disorder that causes her to sleep continuously for days and sometimes months on end. Last year Imaarl Duprey, 23, slept almost continuously for 59 days and behaved as if she was a small child during the episode. The graduate suffers from Kleine Levin Syndrome (KLS) - dubbed Sleeping Beauty Syndrome - which affects just 1,000 people in the world and can cause her to become incredibly drowsy without warning. Imaarl Duprey, 23, suffers from Kleine Levin Syndrome, that causes her to fall in to sleep-like trances, become irritable and disorientated as well as want to eat excessive amounts of food . Imaarl, a fashion worker from Lewisham, London, is left in a dream-like trance or acts erratically during the few hours when her family wake her to ensure she eats, drinks and uses the bathroom. She relies on round the clock care and assistance from her mum Kerry Griffiths, 46 and sister Shahnequa Duprey, 21. 'It’s had a really big impact on me and my family,' Imaarl said. 'In the early days of having KLS my mum thought I could be having a breakdown - I thought the same. I need constant supervision. My sister has been forced to miss university lectures and my mum has taken a lot of time off work. Kleine-Levin Syndrome is a neurological condition that starts during adolescence, and sometimes begins after an infection or illness. It is characterised by periods of excessive sleep of up to 20 hours a day. Episodes can come on very quickly and last between a few days to a few weeks. During such an episode a sufferer may be irritable, childish, disorientated and want to eat excessive amounts of food. Patients return to normal between episodes, however they may become depressed as a consequence of the condition. 1,000 people worldwide suffer from the disorder, which is commonly known as Sleeping Beauty Syndrome. 70% of sufferers are male. There is no known cure for the sleeping disorder, and the main treatment is watchful waiting at home by loved ones. Research suggests episodes decrease in frequency and intensity over the course of 8 to 12 weeks. 'The condition has become a punishment for them, as well as me. I don’t know how I’d cope without them. Mother Kerry, a teaching assistant, said: 'If it was just sleeping it would be so much easier. 'When I wake her so she can use the bathroom or eat something, she’s a different person completely. 'Imaarl’s gone. She’s somewhere else. She’s replaced by a toddler. It’s been a stressful time.' Imaarls first developed the condition in 2008. She was 18-years-old when she slept for 10-days after a family party. The episode was dismissed as a one off and Imaarl headed off on her first holiday with friends to Ayia Napa later that year. But the drowsy symptoms of KLS returned and she only knew she’d been away after waking up with a sun tan. Imaarl recalled: 'While I was at the airport waiting for my flight I was feeling fuzzy, but I thought it was the excitement and early start, and nothing sinister. 'When we reached Ayia Napa I had this drunken feeling, even though I hadn’t been drinking. I knew something wasn’t right, but I thought I could deal it or it would pass. 'One night I was in a club and I remember lying on the floor. Everyone was walking past me. Luckily, a group of teachers from my hotel found me and took me back to my friends. It’s terrifying to think what could have happened. For most of the week long holiday, . Imaarl fought off the sleep symptoms of KLS, but when she was back home . she slept for ten days. Vulnerable: During an episode, Imaarl, sleeps for days on end. She needs round the clock care to help ensure she is safe and make sure she gets enough food and water . 'The holiday was a blur,' Imaarl continued. 'When I woke up the only reason I knew I had been away was my tan.' Imaarl visited her doctor  but did not get an answer - one GP dismissed her symptoms as simply being ‘typical teenage behaviour’. Indeed It . took years for Imaarl’s KLS to be properly diagnosed, as there is no . test for the condition and it has to be established through a process of . elimination with other disorders. She underwent scans for a brain tumour and tests for narcolepsy at King’s College Hospital in London. 'It . was traumatic, but in a way I was almost hoping for a brain tumour, . because at least then I would know what was happening and there would be . doctors and surgeons who could help,' she explained. 'With KLS there is so much uncertainty. You’re on your own. That’s the scary thing.' Despite her debilitating condition, Imaarl (pictured, right, with sister Shahnequa) managed to graduate with a degree in psychology from Goldsmiths, University of London . Leading a normal life became difficult for Imaarl, but she was determined to complete her psychology degree at Goldsmiths, University of London. Imaarl continued: 'At times I would suffer from extreme tiredness. I missed deadlines and had to leave classes because I was too exhausted. 'Some people assumed I was lazy or going to parties all the time. As time went by I started to recognise when an episode was starting. 'It’s like you’re going under anaesthetic. You’re floating in and out of consciousness. You can feel it coming on. During her time at university Imaarl would suffer from extreme tiredness. She missed deadlines and had to leave classes because she was exhausted . 'One day I came out of a class at university and I just started crying. I was completely disorientated. I couldn’t remember how to get home. I had to call my mum for directions, as she drove to find me.' In 2010, Imaarl suffered an episode that lasted a month and she missed vital exams which meant she had to re-sit her final year. Her mum said: 'I knew how devastated she was going to be when she came round. She sobbed her heart out when she found out she had been sick again.' During an episode, life changes dramatically for Imaarl, and her mum and sister. As KLS heightens noise and light sensitivity, Imaarl sleeps with the curtains drawn, conversations are kept to whispers, the TV is virtually silent and visitors are turned away. Kerry said: 'When a GP arrived to see her, she was absolutely hysterical. She was sobbing, completely terrified. She can only cope with me and her sister.' To make sense of life within an episode, Imaarl will follow a repetitive routine when she’s awake. She watches movies on repeat and eats the same food constantly, while Kerry and Shahnequa ensure Imaarl eats properly and stays hydrated. 'Last time it was Wotsits and McDonalds,' says Imaarl. 'It must be the only way I can make sense of what’s happening. It’s the only thing I have control over. In December 2012, Imaarl graduated from Goldsmiths, University of London with a degree in Psychology. Kerry added: 'She did amazingly well to get through it in the end. We’re all really proud of her.' A month later and Imaarl was hit with an episode that lasted two months, between January and March. Imaarl said: 'I¿m a happy person in everyday life and I don¿t want KLS to overtake me. I¿m not sure about the future, but I want to stay positive' 'For two years I hadn’t suffered a significant episode,' Imaarl said. 'I thought it might have been over. 'It can be depressing, because I have no control over the condition and there’s no effective treatment or cure. 'I’m a happy person in everyday life and I don’t want KLS to overtake me. I’m not sure about the future, but I want to stay positive. Dr Guy Leschziner, Consultant Neurologist and Sleep Physician at Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospital in London, said: 'KLS is a very rare neurological disorder characterised by recurrent episodes of profound sleepiness, typically lasting days or weeks. 'The typical picture is that of a young teenager, who becomes confused, has pathological eating to excess and sometimes aggression or other personality changes during these episodes. 'The condition can be potentially devastating, as it can ruin young people’s social, educational and social lives. 'The cause is unknown; there may be a genetic or autoimmune component to it, but this is at present very speculative. 'It remains unclear whether KLS is one disease or other are a number of slightly different conditions that have common features. 'As the disease is very rare, even experts will have seen relatively small numbers of patients.'

Speaking . about the huge influx of calls Mr Bird said: 'We always knew this information was out there, but now . people are being given permission to report it and it's clear they are . being taken seriously. 'Over the years we've heard many stories of paedophilia rife in the showbiz world in the 60s, 70s and 80s. Now the floodgates have opened.

Mr Vine replied: 'This is a complete and utter nightmare. 'The fact that a person was using his BBC prestige and maybe even BBC dressing rooms to attack young children I find completely disgusting as a father of two young daughters. 'I cannot believe that it happened for such a sustained period that we may be looking at one of the most serious predatory paedophiles in criminal history - and he was on our doorstep. I find it disgusting.' Meanwhile, it emerged that Savile ran 'lasses only' discos at Broadmoor psychiatric Hospital in Berkshire and used the events to prey on young girls. A source told the Daily Mirror: 'Savile did whatever he wanted at Broadmoor and nobody could stop him'. The star hosted the discos during the 1970s as 'therapeutic entertainment' which gave him free reign to get close to potential victims away from the staff. Today, Savile's long-time producer on children's TV show Jim'll Fix It said he was completely unaware of the presenter's activities and said the star managed to 'hoodwink' him. But Roger Ordish said he did know that Savile had a 'predilection for younger females'.

'manipulative' man. A grinning waxwork of Jimmy Savile unveiled at Madame Tussauds at the height of his fame will never see the light of day again, it was confirmed yesterday. The disgraced star’s £30,000 likeness is to be left along with other permanently mothballed effigies of shamed public figures - including paedophile pal Gary Glitter. A beaming Savile posed with his waxwork in matching gold tracksuits when the figure first went on show at Tussauds flagship London site in 1986 (pictured) but it was removed in the early 1990s. Savile joined his likeness on a bench for the unveiling sitting with his hands clasped under a mock-up of a Fix It badge saying 'Jim’ll Fix It at Madame Tussauds'. Tussauds do not destroy their creations - but has made clear its memorial to Savile’s tarnished memory will never leave it vaults ever again. 'The figure hasn’t been in the attraction for many years and won’t be returning.' But he told ITV1's This Morning he saw no abuse during the two decades in which he worked with the late TV and radio host. 'I . didn't see anything and nothing was reported to me,' he said.During . their years working together, Ordish said Savile, whom he described as a . private man who 'compartmentalised' different areas of his life, even . stayed at his home. 'He . slept in a bedroom next to my 14-year-old daughter and I hope that is . some indication that we had no suspicions of anything of this nature at . all,' he said. The disclosures about Savile's private life were made in an ITV documentary a fortnight ago which had dismayed Ordish. 'I was absolutely shocked and . shattered and I was surprised that I had not been approached by the . programme,' he said of the Exposure documentary. He maintained he knew nothing about . Savile's activities, although he told This Morning hosts Phillip . Schofield and Holly Willoughby there had been rumours. But he went on: 'You hear rumours about everybody famous, there must be rumours that go around about you two. 'We . were aware that Jim had a predilection for younger females,' he added, . saying it was obvious from the way he chatted to girls. Ordish said Savile would compliment them on their beauty, 'but nothing obscene'. 'These . are girls who are young females, they're not children.

David Cameron yesterday backed a college’s controversial decision to ban pupils wearing the full facial veil for security reasons. All students, staff and visitors to Birmingham Metropolitan College were told they must have their faces visible at all times so they are ‘easily identifiable’. But the move has been criticised by some students, one describing the policy as disgusting. Today a protest organised on Facebook – supported by the local Labour MP – is being held at the campus in central Birmingham. Two Muslim students at the Birmingham Metropolitan College campus in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands. The college have banned Muslim girls from wearing a veil. Eyes, nose and mouth all have to be visible . Split: David Cameron backed schools and colleges to enforce uniform rules but Nick Clegg said he felt 'uneasy' about telling people what they should wear . More than 800 people claimed they planned to attend to stand up to what they said was an ‘Islamophobic’ decision. Mr Cameron’s spokesman said the Prime . Minister defended the right of educational institutions to be able to . ‘set and enforce their own school uniform policies’. But Deputy Prime . Minister Nick Clegg said he felt ‘uneasy’ about a veil ban in a . schools, although he could understand why it was needed to identify . people at airport checkouts. The college which has 44,000 students . and is the third largest in the UK, say headwear poses a security risk . and their policy ‘includes the removal of hoodies, hats, caps and veils . so that faces are visible’. This would stop female Muslim pupils from . wearing the niqab, the full facial veil where only the woman’s eyes are . visible, or the burqa where the eye area is covered in mesh. Controversial policy: Staff at Birmingham Metropolitan College, pictured, have said the guidelines are in place for 'security reasons' Outrage: Imaani Ali, 17, believes the ban on veils is a breach of her freedom - this veil is not allowed because it covers all, but Imaani's eyes . Student . Imaani Ali, 17, who studies applied sciences said: ‘We would happily . show the men at security our faces so they could check them against our . IDs, but they won’t let us. It’s a breach of my freedom and I feel . discriminated against.’ Another 17-year-old student, who was not named, . said: ‘It’s disgusting.’ The Prime Minister’s spokesman said: ‘We back schools being able to set and enforce their own school uniform policies.’ Nick . Clegg, asked about the decision on his LBC radio phone-in, told a . caller he ‘set the bar very high to justify something like that’ He . added: ‘I’ve always defended people’s right to wear what they want and . that’s very much what I would apply here.’ The Education Department . said it is up to the governing body of a school to decide whether there . should be a school uniform or any other rules about appearance, and if . so what they should be. But Shabana Mahmood, the Labour MP for . Ladywood, said she was shocked by the policy, and has written an open . letter to the college’s principal calling for an urgent meeting. In the . letter to Christine Braddock CBE, she expressed ‘deep concerns’ that it . would deter young women from her constituency from attending the . college. In a statement the principal said the policy, developed . after consultation with students, ‘will mean everyone allowed on the . premises can understand and know each other in a safe environment.’ The college provides A-level and vocational training for around 9,000 16 to 19-year-olds and 35,000 mature students. Case by case: Schools can outlaw veils but only after a consultation . Headteachers have the power to order students to remove veils after a series of high profile legal cases. In a key 2007 case, a High Court judge rejected a bid by a pupil to be allowed to wear the niqab in class. Although the 12-year-old’s three older sisters had worn the headwear at the same school in Buckinghamshire, teachers said it impeded their ability to communicate with her. They said they needed to be able to tell if a pupil was paying attention, engaged with her work or distressed. After the case, the Government issued guidance that enabled headteachers to ban full-face veils on grounds of security, safety or learning. It said teachers were justified in enforcing uniform rules which mean they can see and make eye contact with pupils. Schools need to be able to identify pupils to maintain order in classrooms and to spot any intruders, it added. But rather than a French-style blanket ban on face coverings in all public spaces, the Department of Education said institutions could outlaw the coverings as long as they carried out a proper consultation. Updated Government guidance released last year clearly continues to back heads who choose to ban face-coverings. It says it is ‘still lawful’ to restrict the freedom of pupils to express their religion on the grounds of ‘health, safety and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others’. And religious freedoms do not mean pupils can practise their beliefs ‘at any time, in any place, or in any particular manner,’ the  guidance adds.","Birmingham Metropolitan College forces teenagers to remove items .

The newly-engaged TV host debuted her new diamond, given to her over the weekend by boyfriend of two years John Molner, at Wednesday night's U.S. Open matches. The ring appears to boast a large, cushion-cut solitaire diamond, placed in a minimalistic white gold or platinum setting. Scroll down for video . Love Stoned: Katie Couric attended Wednesday night's U.S. Open matches with new fiance John Molner . The 56-year-old talk show host and . veteran journalist, who . was widowed in 1998 after her husband died of colon cancer, admitted that she thought Mr Molner, 50, was being 'pathetic' when he asked her to go for a walk on the beach last weekend. Radar reports that she told 95.5 PLJ Radio today: 'It was actually very funny. He said, ""Hey, do you want to go for a walk on the beach?"" And I was like, ""Not really,"" and he said, ""Come on"" and I said, ""Honestly I'm really tired, why don't you just take a bike and you go for a walk on the beach?""' When her boyfriend persisted still, she said she finally agreed, but only because she thought, 'this is sort of pathetic, he's begging.' 'He was so stealthy about it. I was incredibly impressed that he was able to pull it off!' But even on the beach, when Mr Molner began talking about how much he loved her, Ms Couric failed to realize that he was on the verge of popping the question. 'He said, ""I brought you here for a reason,"" and I was like, ""Why?"" and he said, ""I wanted to tell you that I really love you,"" and I'm like, ""I know that.""' Then finally, he told her straight: 'He said ""Couric I'm trying to propose to you!""' Ms Couric added that she had no idea the proposal was coming: 'He was so stealthy about it.

She also expressed that she was surprised it took 15 years to meet a . 'keeper' but added that 'things happen when they're supposed to. 'I hope it shows people that it's never too late, not if you put yourself out there,' the mother-of-two continued.

High Spirits: Katie Couric and her new fiance John Molner were all smiles at Wednesday night's US Open matches . Ms Couric said she was 'stunned' by the proposal and had 'no clue' it was on the cards. She says their nuptials are likely to take place after her youngest daughter Carrie, 17, leaves for college. Ms Couric told People in 2011 that she . always imagined herself as a 'modern-day' version of the twice married . TV character, Carol Brady. Speaking about . dating following the death of her first husband, Jay Monahan, she said: 'I thought, it's important for me to go . out. I'm always excited to meet new people and have a social life. 'I think dating is fun actually. I enjoy that part of my life.' Bride-to-be: The chat show host made her engagement public on Tuesday via Twitter . However, after several failed relationships she worried she would never find another life partner. 'I had a series of relationships . . but they didn't seem right for the long haul,' she said. However, in early 2012 she met 50-year-old Mr Molner through mutual friends and they soon hit it off. They first went public with their . relationship in April 2012 and Ms Couric said later that year, 'He's . great. He's from Chicago. I . love Midwesterners!' She . told People that she knew he was a 'keeper' when he agreed to go to a . grocery store with her mother, and helped her find generic - and cheap - pain reliever.

'Mom's a big bargain hunter, and John rose to the occasion, I thought, ""Wow this guy is pretty good.""' 'Mom's a big bargain hunter, and John rose to the occasion, I thought, ""Wow this guy is pretty good""' Before Mr Molner, Ms Couric was dating entrepreneur, Brooks Perlin, who is 17 years her junior. They met at a charity event held to raise money for cancer research in 2006 and remained together for five years. There was speculation at the time that her new relationship with Mr Molner came too soon after the split. However, mutual friends of the couple reportedly said that they had been trying to set them up for years.

Drivers in China will have to think twice before they break the speed limit in Shanghai, after a staggering 60 CCTV cameras were installed on just one stretch of road. Government officials have been criticised after fitting the mointors to cover the two-lane Youyi Road, even though it is not deemed to be a dangerous area. The excessive surveillance has led to allegations that public money has been squandered after images of the two beams covered in devices were posted on social media. Excessive: The cameras were installed on two beams above Youyi Road in Shanghai . Surveillance: The devices are likely to act as a deterrent to motorists, despite the controversy . Criticised: Government officials, who did not coordinate when the cameras were being installed, have been accused of wasting public money and overkill . Local officials initially declined to comment on why there was so many cameras monitoring drivers. But it later turned out that the cameras had all been put up by a range of departments, none of which had taken the time to find out whether there were already cameras in place. The police, local traffic monitoring departments, the weather bureau, the tourism board and a dozen other bodies, including those responsible for testing the surveillance technology, had all installed their own devices. Safe: The monitors cover each side of the road, despite the fact it has not been deemed as dangerous . Justification: An engineer from the company who operates the cameras claimed they were fitted for testing . The cameras, installed close to an intersection, had been fitted on two arms stretching across each side of the road. A spokeswoman for the Shenzhen-based Launch Digital Technology, a surveillance equipment manufacturer who provides devices to the government, defended the move saying that it was quite common to have more than one camera fitted in order to cover blind spots and handle a large volume of traffic. It was revealed that Baokang Electronic, a manufacturer of signals used by the police, owned the devices. Company engineer Xue Xiaogang said: 'They are installed for testing. Only a few of them are cameras, many are various kinds of flashlights to allow cameras to operate in the dark.' Concerns: People who saw the photos online said the cameras should be spread around the city and not isolated in one place .","Dozens of devices were installed on the two-lane Youyi Road in Shanghai .

Britain risks returning to the anti-immigrant rhetoric of Enoch Powell’s infamous ‘rivers of blood’ speech, Archbishop Desmond Tutu has warned. The Nobel peace laureate said the intense debate over opening borders to new migrants from Romania and Bulgaria risked overshadowing the ‘opportunity’ presented by new arrivals to Britain. The intervention comes as a poll showed almost half of Britons think the right to work and live in the UK should be blocked for Romanians and Bulgarians. Nobel peace laureate Desmond Tutu said Britain must recognise the 'opportunity' presented by immigration . Concerns have been raised in Westminster over the numbers of Romanians and Bulgarians who might come to the UK when movement controls imposed when they joined the European Union expire in January. The government is considering extending the amount of time migrants have to be in the UK before they can claim benefits from three months to up to six months. Ministers are also examining how to curb access to housing, benefits and NHS treatment for new arrivals to tackle the ‘pull factors’ which attract people to Britain. Enoch Powell was a senior Conservative politician in the 1950s and 1960s, serving as a Treasury minister and health minister under Harold Macmillan. But in 1968 he was sacked as shadow defence secretary by Tory leader Ted Heath for a controversial speech on Commonwealth immigration. He claimed that not all immigrants wanted to integrate in Britain, instead seeking to foster racial and religious differences 'with a view to the exercise of actual domination, first over fellow-immigrants and then over the rest of the population'. He added: 'As I look ahead, I am filled with foreboding. Like the Roman, I seem to see ""the River Tiber foaming with much blood"".' It became known as the Rivers of Blood speech. Heath said it was 'inflammatory and liable to damage race relations'. More than 40 years later, Tory Treasury minister Sajid Javid said that damage has still not been repaired. But Archbishop Tutu said the issue risked creating racial tensions last seen in the 1968s, when senior Conservative Mr Powell criticised immigration from the Commonwealth, saying: ‘As I look ahead, I am filled with foreboding; like the Roman, I seem to see “the River Tiber foaming with much blood”.’ Archbishop Tutu warned: ‘We are beginning to hear the same kind of tune that we had when Enoch Powell was doing his stuff.. ‘I thought that was one of the worst moments of your modern history.’ He said it was people from Britain who helped to ‘recover’ South Africa's humanity. Speaking on a visit where he was granted the Freedom of the City of London, he added: ‘I hope you do not miss the opportunity [of immigration]. ‘Opposing it would be just for short-term returns. People are worried, rightly of course, about economics but in the end those who do not share end up not actually enriched. They are certainly going to be impoverished in their humanity.’ The former Archbishop of Cape Town spoke about the ‘how welcoming and affirming people’ were for him and his wife when they first came to Britain in 1962. His comments were echoed by The Bishop of London, the Right Rev Richard Chartres, who said: ‘Our immigrants are an economic advantage. The diversity of this place is part of its attraction.’ Meanwhile, an opinion poll for Channel . 5 News found 47 per cent of people thought migrants from the two . countries should have no right to live, work or claim benefits in the UK . and 56 per cent believed immigration had resulted in a negative impact . on Britain. One in four . people surveyed in the Chancel 5 News poll thought Romanians and . Bulgarians should be treated the same as other EU citizens and 18 per . cent thought they should have more limited rights to live, work and . access welfare in the UK. A . third of people surveyed over-estimated the percentage of people born . outside the UK living in the country, thinking the figure was over 40 . per cent, rather than the 13 per cent indicated in the 2011 census. More . than a quarter (27 per cent) of those surveyed said Ukip had the best . immigration policies, followed by Labour on 18 per cent, the Tories on . 12 per cent and Lib Dems on 7 per cent. The UK government is under pressure to curb entry to the UK when EU restrictions on Romanians and Bulgarians coming here to work are lifted in January . Romania's Foreign Minister, Titus . Corlatean told Channel 5 News he did not expect a ‘flood’ of migrants . from his country to come to Britain after January 1 and attacked the way . the immigration debate had been conducted in the UK. He . said Mr Cameron should reject ‘in clear terms if it's possible the . xenophobic and populistic and once again sometimes racist attitudes . which are promoted by some other British politicians’.

A British woman who married a wealthy Austrian doctor has lost an appeal . for custody of their four year-old twins after a court ruled he is the . better parent. Cambridge graduate Beth Schlesinger fell in love with society doctor Michael Schlesinger, but after having sons Samuel and Benjamin their marriage fell apart. After he was given custody of their boys, the daughter of a successful Manchester solicitor has been fighting the decision for two years but has lost her latest appeal. She had moved to Vienna to marry him despite protests from her parents and being unable to speak any German. But, she said, the relationship began to wane after only a week and just eight months later the relationship was over. She claims he became so controlling he would not even let her go to the toilet at night. After . they separated and started a custody battle over the children, Dr . Schlesinger, 33, unsuccessfully attempted to have his wife sectioned. His . claims that she had a mental illness were dismissed in court, but an . Austrian judge still took the rare step of giving him sole custody of . the twins. Mrs Schlesinger now has visitation rights but can see her sons Samuel and Benjamin for only 20 hours a fortnight. She . has accused the court of unfairly favouring her ‘well-connected’ husband and has appealed to the Austrian high court, which failed today. She now plans to launch a final appeal with Austria's Supreme Court and claims the her sons have started self-harming. Bitter dispute: Samuel and Benjamin's case has benefited her estranged husband because he has friendships in the Austrian legal sector, Mrs Schlesinger claims . Still married: Mother of two graduated from Cambridge but gave up her place on a master’s course at a New York university after she fell in love with society doctor Michael Schlesinger, right, but they later split . 'There seems to be no justice in this country, that they can . deprive two little boys of their mother in such a barbaric way,' she said. 'It . contravenes all human rights. Sammy and Benji are two vulnerable little . boys who have a right to their mother in their lives. 'Everybody . involved in the story over here - from lawyers to journalists to social . workers are shocked and outraged at this decision. 'Why the . Austrian justice system refuses to acknowledge that simple truth is . beyond me. I only hope that sanity and justice are restored soon.' The twins: Mrs Schlesinger believes her boys Samuel and Benjamin should be with her, not her husband, but the Austrian courts disagree .

Army vet: The family of Colonel Joseph Chapman were horrified to discover a stranger in his casket . A family mourning the death of a loved one were horrified to discover that a stranger was occupying the casket when they went for to view their family member's body for the last time on Friday evening. Jim McLain and his family arrived at Everly Funeral Home in Fairfax, Virginia and quickly realized the man in the casket was not McLain's father, Joseph 'Mal' Chapman who died on November 21 and the age of 80. Making matters worse for the grieving family, the funeral home had already buried Joseph Chapman in a plot in Winchester, instead of next to his beloved wife Carolyn who predeceased him in 2006, at Arlington National Cemetery. A distraught McLain immediately alerted staff at the home to the mix-up, . but says he was dismissed by Everly staff who told him a mix-up was . impossible. Although they were convinced the man was not . Chapman, having his identical twin, Alvin Chapman, present at the . viewing showed that the man in the casket looked nothing like Joseph . Chapman. 'I kept looking at him. And I was like, there's no way he could be this much changed,' McLain told WJLA. The . man in the coffin had an 'extreme receding hairline' as opposed to . Chapman's head of white hair, and a completely different nose. But . when McLain alerted Everly staff to the mistake he was dismissed by . funeral home staff who told him a mix-up was impossible. Mix-up: The Everly Funeral Home has not spoken publicly about the mix-up that saw them bury the wrong man and put a stranger on display for a viewing . Grieving son: Jim McLain was denied the chance to pay his respects to his father at an open casket viewing on Friday . The funeral director refused to see the family until, 15 minutes later, a member of staff checked the toe-tag on the man in Chapman's casket - which proved beyond a doubt that the wrong man had been put on display. 'This just isn’t right. This should never, never happen. This is something you read in a fiction novel or see in a movie on TV,' McLain told WJLA. Adding insult to injury, the funeral home had dressed the wrong man in Joseph Chapman's Army uniform. Chapman was a decorated colonel and the uniform had taken him 28 years to earn. The burial he deserves: Joseph Chapman's family just want to bury him with full military honors . 'My dad’s uniform... that’s degradation beyond words for a military man,' McLean told WJLA, his voice breaking with emotion. The family, not knowing what else to do, called police who told them that mixing up bodies inside a funeral home is not a crime. 'They say now they have to wait for Monday to get a judge to get an order for the body to be dug up,' McLain said.

Desperate attempts by Ed Balls to distance Labour from the Co-operative Bank scandal foundered last night as startling new evidence emerged of the intimate ties between the party and the stricken lender. The Shadow Chancellor angrily attacked what he branded a 'smear' campaign over Labour’s connections with disgraced former Co-op boss Paul Flowers, who is under police investigation for allegedly buying crack cocaine and crystal meth. Mr Balls insisted that Flowers, a former business adviser to leader Ed Miliband, was 'out, out, out' of the Labour Party. Corridors of power: Paul Flowers attends a Downing Street reception in 2010 under the last government . But questions intensified over the opposition's cosy relationship with the bank after it emerged that Mr Balls had bragged about his role in rubber-stamping legislation that paved the way for a disastrous takeover deal at the Co-op. He also accepted a £50,000 donation from the group in March 2012, when Flowers was the bank’s chairman. There were also mounting questions about the extraordinary special treatment the bank gave to Labour - extending 'soft' loans with preferential rates of interest and admitting that other clients would never be allowed to keep on borrowing so much. When Labour was on the brink of bankruptcy, then general secretary Peter Watt had a meeting with a senior Co-op executive at which it was agreed that vast debts would not be called in. On another dramatic day in the spiralling scandal: . Mr Miliband yesterday hit back at what aides said was a concerted Government smear campaign over the extent of the Labour leadership’s links with Flowers. 'What this episode shows is more about the character of the Prime Minister than about the character of Labour’s relationship with the Co-op,' he said. 'Smeared'? Ed Balls tried his best to distance himself from Paul Flowers today . 'We have a Prime Minister who, when he sees a serious situation at the bank, tries to make cheap political points rather than sorting it out.' And in a series of increasingly bad-tempered TV and radio interviews, Mr Balls insisted that he had known nothing about the allegations concerning the former Co-op Bank chairman. He said Flowers had been suspended from Labour membership and was 'out, out, out'. Mr Balls said he would not repay a . £50,000 donation his office received from the Co-operative Group – . saying he was 'proud' to have received it. He claimed the donation had nothing to . do with Flowers, even though the former bank boss told MPs this month . that he had helped to arrange it. 'I am proud to have that donation,' the Shadow Chancellor insisted. 'They made a donation to me last year . which I am very proud of and was properly declared.' Mr Balls rejected Tory calls for him to . repay the cash, insisting: 'I have not got £50,000 in my office to give . back and I don’t think it would be the right thing to do. Labour past: Paul Flowers celebrates winning a seat in the 2008 local elections . He denied discussing the donation with Flowers, saying: 'I have never in my life had a conversation with Paul Flowers about that matter or any other. Paul Flowers was not involved in that in any way.' Challenged about Flowers’s evidence to MPs, Mr Balls suggested it could not be trusted. 'He was someone who was buying drugs and engaged with rent boys,' he said. 'He has made a lot of allegations. There is no truth in that at all.' However, the Shadow Chancellor faced fresh questions as it emerged that he boasted in 2010 that as a minister in the last government, he had ensured Treasury support for a 'super-mutual' deal which saw the Co-op merge with Britannia Building Society. As a result of the failed takeover, thousands of small investors face losses, 50 branches could close and job losses will be in the thousands. When he was trying to win the Labour leadership contest, Mr Balls said: 'I promoted co-operatives throughout my time in government... I was able to show this by ensuring Treasury support for a new Private Member’s Bill that led to the creation of the first ever “super-mutual”, bringing Britannia Building Society and the Co-op Bank together in the interests of customers, rather than the banking elite.' Conservative MP Brooks Newmark said: 'This raises serious concerns about Ed Balls’s relationship with the Co-op Bank and the role he played in this merger. It also proves a sham of recent attempts by Mr Balls to distance himself from the Co-op Bank.' A spokesman for Mr Balls said: 'The decision by the Co-op Bank in 2009 to merge with the Britannia Building Society was a commercial one for the bank which Ed had absolutely no involvement in.' Former general secretary Mr Watt’s memoirs give further evidence of the special treatment afforded by the bank to Labour. Recalling a meeting as he sought to fend off bankruptcy for the party in 2006, he says a Co-op executive told him: 'I’m coming under huge pressure at my end to demonstrate that we’re not going to lose all our money. Under normal circumstances, with other clients, we would not even be having this conversation. We’d just pull the plug.' One well-placed source said: 'Why did the Co-op allow the party to get into that level of debt? In 2005 the party really overspent and had a multi-million pound overdraft from the Co-op. 'The overdraft essentially stayed the same. There was no requirement to reduce it. It was just held. 'Some of the account managers were uncomfortable at the levels of the debt the party was being given. The party was in serious trouble, it had no capital - there was nothing to underwrite. There’s no doubt that preferential treatment was given because of the political friendship.' Paul Flowers has enjoyed a host of high-profile roles over the past 20 years in the Labour Party, the Methodist church, charities and the Co-operative Group. They include: . Chairman of the Co-op BankJoined the board in 2008 then appointed chairman in April 2010 on a salary of £132,000. Stepped down in June 2013. Also deputy chairman of the Co-operative Group.

A mother of five forced to register as a sex offender after being convicted of sexual contact with her daughter’s 14-year-old ex-boyfriend is willing to risk arrest to attend her daughter’s graduation. Linda Lusk, 52, the former mayor of Prosser, WA., is barred by the town school district from attending any events involving other children. She is vowing to be in attendance for her daughter’s graduation next spring even if it means she will be arrested for trespassing. Ms Lusk agreed to a plea deal that did not force her to admit guilt – she has maintained her innocence from day one – served two months in jail and two years probation, which ended last year. I didn't do it: Donna Lusk reached a plea deal with prosecutors but still denies her guilt . ‘There is no way that they're going to keep me.’ Ms Lusk told ABC News, ‘I mean, even if I get arrested, I am going to my daughter’s graduation.’ Bubba Frank was 14-years-old when he told friends Ms Lusk gave him oral sex, he never went to the police, according to ABC News. Ms Lusk was eventually charged with third degree child molestation, and even admitted to inadvertently grazing Mr Frank’s penis with her hand, but denied molesting the young boy. With her probation over, Ms Lusk is no longer barred from any events involving children besides her own, but Prosser school officials have refused requests she has made to attend school events. Big man on campus: Bubba Frank, then only 14-years-old, bragged to friends the older woman performed oral sex on him . Kevin Lusk, Ms Lusk’s now-former husband, was the school principal, according to ABC. He publicly defended her, but later filed for divorce, which was finalized last year. When her son’s baseball team made the playoffs, Ms Lusk wrote asking for permission to attend his games. ‘If baseball games are at other school districts, we have no trespass authority,’ Prosser Schools Superintendent Ray Tolcacher responded, according to ABC. ‘At Prosser, request is denied. The district hasn’t yet decided whether Ms Lusk will be allowed to attend the graduation, officials told ABC. Gone in a flash: Kevin Lusk, Ms Lusk's ex-husband, publicly supported her, but soon filed for divorce . ‘It's not fair,’ daughter Karlie told ABC. ‘It's a lot of restricting and, like, unnecessary things.’ The divorced handbag shop owner has even been denied attendance to parent-teacher conferences. ‘The fact that I've been denied access to their parent-teacher conferences gives me grave concern that they're going to deny my access to graduation,’ she told ABC. It's not fair: Karlie Lusk, set to graduate in the Spring, feels the school is treating her mother unfairly . Now living with a boyfriend, Ms Lusk still blames the entire incident on a 14-year-old boy. ‘I feel very bad for what happened. I don’t think he’s ever accepted responsibility for what he did,’ she told ABC. Adam Canary, her new boyfriend, was only 28 when they met. He reached out to her after seeing a story on the accused pedophile in 2011, according to ABC.","The teen who accused Donna Lusk of giving him oral sex never went to police, only telling friends .

Golf Lover: Mayor Michael Bloomberg hits from the eighth tee during the The Barclays golf tournament in Paramus, New Jersey August 25 2010 - The mayor has been criticized for not being in New York to personally deal with the Bronx train crash . New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg was playing golf in Bermuda when the Metro-North Bronx train derailed yesterday and only left the course hours after the crash which killed four and left more than 60-injured it was reported today. Bloomberg, 71, who steps down on December 31st after 12-years in power, was spotted on the lavish tropical links of the Mid Ocean golf club as emergency workers rushed to the scene of the crash which occurred at 7.20 am. The mayor is said to have finished up his round at around 1 pm in Bermuda only to arrive at St. Barnabus Hospital in the Bronx, on Sunday night. When asked today where he had been all day Sunday, Bloomberg was evasive and shot back, 'You have a real question?' 'When I was informed about the train wreck, I was in constant communications with my commissioners who were there to do the job. 'They're supposed to show up and they're supposed to do it. And that's exactly what they did.' The Wall Street Journal first reported that Bloomberg was seen in Bermuda on Sunday, not the first time the mayor has been out of the country when a disaster has struck. Deadly: The Metro-North passenger train lays on it's side after derailing in the Bronx borough of New York, Sunday, Dec. 1, 2013 causing the death of four passengers and injuries to more than 60 other commuters . In 2010, Bloomberg was widely criticized for his response to the December 26th blizzard which crippled the Big Apple as he vacationed in Bermuda. On Sunday, a spokesman for the billionaire businessman refused to talk about his whereabouts as the accident struck, declining to confirm if he was golfing on Bermuda, which is one hour ahead of New York City. As he visited St. Barnabus Hospital in the Bronx on Sunday night he was asked directly by reporters to explain his absence. 'What can I do? I’m not a professional firefighter or a police officer,' said Bloomberg. 'There’s nothing I can do. What I can do is make sure that the right people from New York City – our police commissioner, our fire commissioner and our emergency management commissioner – are there and that they have all the resources that they want.' Rush to help: First responders work the scene of a derailment of a Metro-North passenger train in the Bronx borough of New York Sunday, Dec. 1, 2013. The train derailed on a curved section of track in the Bronx . Bloomberg's first public statements about the deadly train derailment came via his Twitter account at approximately 1.25 pm on Sunday. New York City Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio did not criticize Mayor Bloomberg in so many words today - but said that he would let New Yorkers know where he would be at weekends unlike the current incumbent . 'Thoughts and prayers with those impacted by today's train derailment. If you are looking for a loved one who was on-board, call 311,' said the mayor's perfunctory update. When asked why it took him so long to send the tweet, Bloomberg said he did not, in fact, send it. 'I didn’t tweet anybody. Maybe my staff did, but rest assured that I did not,' he said. 'When I was informed about the train wreck – I don’t know if it was in minutes, or 20 minutes, half an hour after it happened, and I was in constant communications with my commissioners, who are there to do the job.' He did not attend the 4.30 pm briefing given by the National Transportation Safety Board - in stark contrast, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly and MTA Chief Thomas Prendergast all were at the crash site on Sunday morning and spent the day in news conferences. New York City Mayor elect Bill de Blasio shot a thinly veiled attack Bloomberg's way today when he claimed he would have run to the accident site himself had he been in office. 'For me, it would be generally-speaking, important to be there,' he said, taking care not to personally criticize his soon-to-be predecessor. Luxury: The water-front estate that New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg owns in Hamilton, Bermuda. Bloomberg has walled off his life in Bermuda from voters in New York, arguing it is none of their business . De Blasio also said he believes it is important for the mayor to disclose exactly where he is, if he is going to leave the city. 'I think it's important to alert the public and the media broadly to my whereabouts,' he said. President Barack Obama, U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), and de Blasio all released statements of concern following the derailment, but Bloomberg did not. Bloomberg's personal trips outside of New York have become controversial for their timing with catastrophe's in the city. However, billionaire Bloomberg has never bowed to pressure to explain his trips to Bermuda, where he owns a multi-million dollar getaway on the exclusive mid-Atlantic island. 'I don’t think the press should be concerned with the personal life of any of the 250,000 wonderful people that work for this city,' said Bloomberg in December 2001 as he took office. When he came under huge criticism for being out of town during the late December blizzard of 2010, Bloomberg said that he's in charge 'all the time', regardless of where in the world he might be. Blizzard: Travelers carry their luggage through a snow bank on 7th Avenue in front of Penn Station after a snow storm in New York December 27, 2010 - the storm wreaked havoc across the city and Mayor Bloomberg was vacationing in Bermuda at the time . When the Wall Street Journal pointed out to Bloomberg that the President has to account for his whereabouts all the time, Bloomberg appeared to disagree. 'The problem is the mayor would have no private life, couldn’t be with his kids when you have the press following you around all the time. President’s job is different,' said Bloomberg in 2001. Indeed, the train derailment marks the second time that Bloomberg has been out of the city during a major incident. In addition to the 2010 storm, Bloomberg was in Washington D.C. for the White House correspondents' dinner in May 2010 when a terrorist tried to blow-up Times Square.","New York Mayor is heavily criticized for not being in the city in the aftermath of the Bronx train derailment on Sunday .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 00:40 EST, 7 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:18 EST, 7 December 2013 . After spending decades puzzling over the origin of Mima mounds, scientists have suggested that pocket gophers may be the mystery architects of the 8-foot-tall, 30-foot-wife dirt pyramids. Mima mounds - massive, grass-covered round or oval earth pimples - were first discovered in 1841 in Western Washington state in a 630-acre prairie. In the 19th century, explorers came up with a theory that the mounds dating back thousands of years are ancient Native American burial sites - but no human remains were ever found inside the loosely packed structures. Nature's pyramids: Geologists in California have proposed theory suggesting that pocket gophers are responsible for building these 8-foot-tall, 30-foot-wide hills known as Mima mounds . Busy builders: A new computer model shows how over 500-700 years, generations of pocket gophers - so named because of their large cheek pouches - could construct a Mima mound by adding handfuls of soil and pebbles . Struggling to explain the existence of millions of Mima mounds peppering open fields in Washington, Oregon and Idaho, experts and amateur geology enthusiasts have come up with a plethora of possible origin stories ranging from natural disasters like earthquakes and floods to aliens. However, a recent study spearheaded by geologist Manny Gabet, of San Jose State University in California, has created a computer model showing how generations of pocket gophers measuring up to 12 inches in length and weighing only a few hundreds grams could plausibly construct a Mima mound over 500-700 years - one handful of soil and pebbles at a time. According to the scientist, the wee burrowing critters are intensely territorial, which could explain why every subsequent generation of gophers would return to the same Mima mound, helping to building it up over the course of centuries. Earth pimples: Countless grass-covered Mima mounds pepper open fields in Washington, Oregon and Idaho . ‘What's really cool about this is scaled by body size, these are the largest structures built by any mammal not including humans,’ Gabet told LiveScience's OurAmazingPlanet. ‘In terms of effort, it would be like a single person building the pyramids.’ Gabet's computer model, which appeared in the October issue of the journal Geomorphology, depicts the interplay between virtual gophers and the unique soil conditions at Mima mound locations. What separates pocket gophers - so named because of their large cheek pouches - from other critters in the Geomyidae family is that the small furry animals push soil upward rather than downhill while working on their tunnels. Moving on up: Unlike other gophers, the pocket gophers push soil upward instead of hurling it downhill . As the theory goes, pocket gophers start pushing soil up, slowly forming a mound, and their descendants are innately drawn to the high spot to continue the work. It is important to note that no one has ever seen a Mima mound under construction, suggesting that either the building process has stopped, or it is extremely slow. Ronald Sletten, a soil scientist at the University of Washington who has studied the state's Mima mounds, said that while Gabet's model does not provide a definitive proof that pocket gophers are indeed behind the Mima mounds, it shows that it is a possibility.","Mima mounds are grass-covered round or oval hills first discovered in 1841 in Western Washington state .

Missing: Retired teacher Carol Sheridan, 73, has been found dead after she went missing for ten days . Police have found the body of a 73-year-old great-grandmother who went missing nearly ten days ago. Officers found Carol Sheridan, who had been missing in the French Alps since October 27, today. Family and friends of the retired schoolteacher, who went went missing in the town of Habère-Poche in the Rhône-Alpes region, have paid tribute to her. The tragic news was announced via a Facebook page set up to coordinate the search for Mrs Sheridan originally from Salford in Greater Manchester. 'I am very sad to announce that French authorities recovered Carol’s body this morning, near to where her car was found a few days ago,' said a message by Sheridan’s grandson Simon, The Local reports. 'There are no further details from the police at the moment,' the post added. He said he was taking comfort from the fact she died doing something she loved. He said: 'We would like to thank everyone who helped in the search, whether by sharing through social media, contacting the press or actually going out and looking. Your efforts meant the world to us; they made us feel supported and they showed us how loved she was - that so many people were so desperate to find her. 'Thank you also for the messages of support and sympathy over the last week. They have helped our family through a very difficult time. 'Carol was an amazing woman who lived an amazing life. She was dearly loved by many and will be hugely missed by all of us. Personally, I am taking some comfort in that her last moments were spent doing something she loved.' Friends and acquaintances of Sheridan, described by her granddaughter as a 'wonderful, generous, kind woman,' have taken to Facebook to offer moving tributes to the retired school teacher, remembered as an adventurous woman who was 'full of life'. 'She was an impressive woman who gave so much to others and in later life, by doing what she loved, she was an inspiration to many,' said one. 'My life is enriched by knowing this remarkable soul,' said another. Sheridan's black Fiat Panda 4x4 vehicle was discovered by police on Monday, a development which her grandaughter Heather Tanton told the Hull Daily Mail had brought 'mixed feelings'. 'We are pleased they have found something but, in a way, we aren't pleased they have found something. It is better than knowing nothing but we are very anxious,' she said. The mother-of-two, who has previously lived in Monte Carlo and is a fluent French speaker, usually contacts family and friends daily via social networking sites, e-mail and telephone, but when no one heard from her, her relatives started the search. Her daughter Fiona Conyers, who lives in New Zealand, co-ordinated a poster campaign and informed French radio stations, locals from the village and also reached out to the mountain community online. She said of the search: 'Our main focus at this point is to find her car. 'The area in which she is thought to be missing is vast. 'We are relying on the public to help us find the car. If we find the car, we find mum, it's that simple.' Appeal: Mrs Sheridan's family co-ordinated a poster campaign and informed French radio stations, locals from the village and reached out to the mountain community online . Mrs Sheridan, a grandmother-of-ten and . great-grandmother-of-four, moved to France from her home in Driffield, . East Yorks, two years ago. She was last seen by her neighbour as she drove off in her car to embark on her walk in the Alps. During the search, her family spoke of their hope that she would be found alive as she was a keen walker and 'as fit as a fiddle'. Mrs . Sheridan's grandaughter, Heather Tanton, 25, said: 'This is just so out . of character for my nan. She'd never go this long without telling us . where she is. 'She'd know . we'd be worried and mainly she'd love to be showing off pictures of what . she'd been doing, so to not hear from her is really worrying.

This computer image shows how specifically-designed plates will be used to reconstruct a road accident victim's face using 3D printing technology. A team of British surgeons are poised to carry out a pioneering operation, which will restore the symmetry of a man’s face using new parts produced by a printer. The unaffected side of the biker’s face has been used to create a mirror image, which will enable perfect facial reconstruction. This image shows how a biker's face is to be reconstructed after it was damaged in a road accident . A computer image of 'scaffolding' for a human ear. The model was created by Wake Forest University in North Carolina, but a similar one will be used to create the 3D printed part of the unknown man's face . Computer images are being used to create titanium implants using Additive Manufacturing, which commonly known as 3D printing. The images are used both to design guides to cut and position facial bones with pinpoint accuracy and create tailor-made implants for the patient. The guides and implants are being produced in medical-grade titanium in Belgium, at one of the world’s few specialist 3D printing facilities. Surgeons in Swansea, south Wales, used an X-ray CT scan to create minutely detailed three-dimensional images to design the bespoke implants. The futuristic work is led by consultant maxillofacial surgeon Adrian Sugar, at Morriston Hospital, Swansea, run by Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board. Mr Sugar said: ‘Effectively, we have done the surgery in virtual reality so that we can mirror this in real life. You cannot make a mistake on a face.’ A scaffolding nose is pictured, which could help patients who needs reconstructive surgery. It relies upon using the patient's own cells so that the body is less likley to reject a new osy part. Unlike the nose pictured, the guides and implants used in the upcoming operation are being produced in medical-grade titanium . The unaffected side of the biker’s face has been used to create a mirror image. Surgeons in Swansea used an X-ray CT scan to create minutely detailed three-dimensional images. These images are used both to design guides to cut and position facial bones and create tailor-made implants for the patient. The guides and implants are being produced in medical-grade titanium in Belgium. The man's injuries were so severe that when he was admitted to hospital, doctors focused on life-saving surgery rather than facial reconstruction. While half of his face was severely damaged, one side was unaffected. Mr Sugar has used a CT scan of this side of the face as a template to create implants in titanium using 3D printing. The operation will involve breaking and cutting several facial bones once again, but the 3D printing process will also produce guide devices allowing the surgeons to reposition bones with pinpoint accuracy. Mr Sugar said: 'We have a good chance of correcting 70 to 80 per cent of the deformity and we will make this man look a lot better.' The work is considered so groundbreaking and radical it already features in an exhibition at London’s Science Museum, even before the operation itself has been carried out. Peter Evans, a reconstructive scientist and Maxillofacial Laboratory Services manager, said: 'The patient suffered trauma and had multiple injuries across his body, including some quite severe facial injuries. 'He underwent emergency surgery at the time and we are now at the stage where we can do a proper reconstruction of his face.' The project is the work of the Centre of Applied Reconstructive Technologies in Surgery (Cartis), established in 2006 as a partnership between Morriston Hospital’s Maxillofacial Unit and Product Design and Research (PDR) based at Cardiff Metropolitan University. Cartis aims to make Wales a world leader in the research, development and application of advanced medical technologies in surgery. Mr Sugar and Mr Evans worked with PDR’s Sean Peel and Ffion O’Malley to virtually plan the complex surgery, which will involve repositioning the patient’s facial bones. Here, a finished ear, which consists of a coiled antenna inside a cartilage structure, is pictured. Two wires lead from the base of the ear and wind around a helical 'cochlea' - the part of the ear that senses sound - which can connect to electrod. It is just one example of a 3D printed organ . Mr Evans added: 'We have done everything up to the point of surgery. The concept of the operation has been virtually designed and we hope to do the work very soon. 'The patient’s facial symmetry will be restored so he should be back to normal as far as his facial looks are concerned.' Discussions are now taking place to plan when the surgery itself will take place. The identity of the patient concerned has not been revealed. Referring to the London exhibition, Mr Evans said: 'The exhibition is all about cutting-edge activities in this area of work so to have this case appear there is amazing.' Called 3D: Printing The Future, the exhibition continues at the Science Museum until July 1 next year.","Computer image shows how specifically-designed plates will be used to reconstruct road accident victim's face .

Only 8,000 Bulgarians a year will come to Britain when restrictions on entry are lifted in January, the country’s ambassador suggested  last night. Konstantin Dimitrov’s forecast is in stark contrast to the 50,000 estimate by the Migrationwatch pressure group, and will be regarded as a woeful underestimate by experts considering between 8,000 and 10,000 Bulgarians already come to the UK every year. Ministers refuse to make their own forecast after the previous government got its figures so wrong. In 2004, Labour estimated 13,000 immigrants a year would arrive when restrictions on Poland and other Eastern European countries were lifted. The actual figure was more than a million in under a decade. Looking for a way out: Bulgarians queue for visa applications outside British Embassy in the capital, Sofia . A survey yesterday revealed that . almost half of Britons think the right to work and live in the UK should . be blocked for Romanians and Bulgarians. The . poll for Channel 5 News found that 47 per cent of people thought . migrants from the two countries should have no right to live, work or . claim benefits in the UK. A total of 56 per cent believed immigration had had a negative impact on Britain. More . than a quarter of voters (27 per cent) said UKIP had the best . immigration policies. Labour was on 18 per cent, the Tories on 12 per . cent and the Lib Dems on 7 per cent. Mr Dimitrov’s claim came as  ministers last night thrashed out plans with Government lawyers to double the time EU migrants have to wait to claim benefits from three months to six. Downing Street, the Department of Work and Pensions and the Lib Dems were also examining plans to force new arrivals to prove that they are seeking work before handing them welfare payments. Insiders say Britain will be fined millions of pounds a day if they seek to restrict benefits further. But senior Lib Dem sources have indicated they would back tighter rules and Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith was last night consulting lawyers. Mr Dimitrov told Channel 5 News that officials should expect ‘maybe 8,000 immigrants a year’. Although the figure is a lot lower than previous estimates, it still means Britain will have to build a new town the size of Harlow or Stevenage every decade to house new arrivals from Bulgaria alone. Earlier this year Mr Dimitrov’s Romanian counterpart, Ion Jinga, predicted between 15,000 and 25,000 Romanian arrivals each year. Mr Dimitrov said the Government ‘cannot stop the free movement of people and their legal access to the UK labour market’ and disputed claims that Bulgarians will steal jobs from English people. ‘If you are member of EU there is a competition of all job offers at stake. Everyone should compete for jobs offers on an equal basis if every applicant is a citizen of a member of the EU.’ Konstantin Dimitrov's forecast is in stark contrast to the 50,000 estimate by the Migrationwatch pressure group . Romanians and Bulgarians have had the right to live and visit the UK without visas since 2007, but companies have to apply for work permits and migrants for an ‘accession worker card’ if they want to be employed as regular staff. These restrictions will be lifted in January. Sir Gerald Howarth, who signed a Commons motion calling for controls to be kept in place on Bulgarian and Romanian immigrants, said even the 8,000 figure cited by the ambassador was too high. He added: ‘It is crystal clear that these people are coming here and they will add massive demand to British services and housing. ‘Immigration is a massive issue for the British people, who have been held in slavery for the last few years, frightened to speak out about their fears on immigration.’ Tory and Lib Dem sources confirmed they were looking at plans to tighten welfare rules so that new arrivals had to wait six months rather than three before claiming benefits. Any change would affect all EU arrivals, not just Bulgarian and Romanian migrants. Mr Duncan Smith is also drawing up plans to insist that many more questions are asked in the habitual residency test, to establish properly if the claimant is really trying to find work. One Tory MP said ministers were under pressure from backbenchers to ‘have a fight’ with the European Court of Justice, even if it was not successful. The MP added: ‘Several of us are arguing that it would be better to take on the system than just back down and say we are powerless to act.’ Labour grandees have admitted they made a ‘spectacular mistake’ by opening Britain’s borders a decade ago. Former Labour Home Secretary Jack Straw . When Poland and other countries from Eastern Europe entered the EU in 2004, Britain lifted labour market controls that would have prevented people from those countries coming to work in the UK – while most other EU nations kept them in place for seven more years. Officials estimated that just 13,000 migrants would flock to the UK a year. In fact, nearly one million came to work from those countries to work in Britain, the equivalent of a city the size of Birmingham. Jack Straw, who was Home Secretary under the last government, recently admitted it was a ‘well-intentioned policy that we messed up’ and the estimates were ‘worthless’. Mr Straw said: ‘One spectacular mistake in which I participated (not alone) was in lifting the transitional restrictions on the Eastern European states like Poland and Hungary which joined the EU in mid-2004. We thought that it would be good for Britain if these folk could come and work here from 2004. ‘Research by the Home Office suggested that the impact of this benevolence would in any event be “relatively small, at between 5,000 and 13,000 immigrants per year up to 2010”.’ David Blunkett, Mr Straw’s successor as Home Secretary, warned that British cities could face riots as an influx of Roma migrants created ‘frictions’.","Konstantin Dimitrov's forecast is in stark contrast to the 50,000 estimate by pressure group Migrationwatch .

Jailed: David Kwiatkowski, a former travelling lab technician, reached a plea agreement after being accused of infecting dozens of patients with hepatitis C through contaminated needles . A traveling medical technician was sentenced Monday to 39 years in prison for stealing painkillers and deliberately infecting dozens of patients in four states with hepatitis C through tainted syringes. 'I don't blame the families for hating me,' David Kwiatkowski said after hearing about 20 statements from people he infected and their relatives. 'I hate myself.' Kwiatkowski, 34, was a cardiac technologist in 18 hospitals in seven states before being hired at New Hampshire's Exeter Hospital in 2011. He had moved from job to job despite being fired at least four times over allegations of drug use and theft. Since his arrest last year, 46 people have been diagnosed with the same strain of hepatitis C he carries. Kwiatkowski admitted stealing painkillers and replacing them with saline-filled syringes tainted with his blood. He pleaded guilty in August to 16 federal drug charges. Before he was sentenced by Judge Joseph LaPlante, Kwiatkowski said he was very sorry what he had done. He said that his crime was caused by an addiction to painkillers and alcohol. The victims spoke angrily and tearfully of the pain that Kwiatkowski had inflicted upon them. Linda Ficken, 71, of Andover, Kan., was one of two Kansas victims to attend the sentencing hearing. She underwent a cardiac catheterization at Hays Medical Center in 2010, and said she is haunted by the memory of Kwiatkowski standing at her bedside for more than an hour, applying pressure to the catheter's entry site in her leg to control a bleeding problem. Scroll down for video... Kwiatkowski has been jailed since his arrest in Massachusetts in July 2012, when he was accused of stealing drugs from the cardiac catheterization lab at Exeter Hospital, New Hampshire, pictured, and replacing them with blood-tainted saline . 'On one hand, you were saving my life, . and on the other hand, your acts are a death sentence for me,' she told . him Monday. 'Do I thank you for what you did to help me? Do I despise . you for what your actions did and will continue to do for the rest of my . life? Or do I simply just feel sorry for you being the pathetic . individual you are?' Lynwood Nelson, who was infected when he . went in for a procedure at the Baltimore VA Medical Center in 2012, said . Kwiatkowski 'should receive the same punishment he gave us: the death . penalty.' Prosecutors had pushed for a 40-year prison sentence, . saying Kwiatkowski created a 'national public health crisis,' put a . significant number of people at risk and caused substantial physical and . emotional harm to a large number of victims.

As a methane machine, the cow produces up to 500 litres of the toxic gas every day because he regurgitates his food, and on this occasion it appeared his efforts were enough to light up the field - or so it would seem. Cows shoulder a lot of the blame for global warming. Agriculture is responsible for about 14 per cent of greenhouse gases and as more cows are raised for slaughter the production of methane increases. While cars are often named as the worse culprit for emitting pollutants, experts say the estimated 1.5 billion cattle in the world are also affecting the Earth's atmosphere. Governments around the world are working to use biogas - such as methane - to power cars or convert it into power to heat homes. Gas powered cars, like the Fiat Multipla, use compressed natural gas (CNG) instead of petrol or diesel.

After attending 132 Bruce Springsteen shows, New Jersey governor Chris Christie has finally had some recognition from his musical idol. For many years, Christie's love for the singer was unrequited but, as he explained on The Daily Show yesterday, he recently got to grips with his hero. During NBC's fundraising concert for victims of superstorm Sandy last week Governor Christie got a hug from The Boss, and he told host Jon Stewart that he tried to be 'cool' but wasn't. Scroll down for video . Al Roker tweeted this picture of the two famous New Jersey resident meeting backstage at the Sandy benefit concert . Christie is a Springsteen fanatic. But despite his best efforts, the liberal musician has long ignored the Republican politician. Springsteen campaigned for President Obama during last month's elections. Yet at NBC's telethon last Friday, the two New Jersey natives met backstage, and hugged it out. Christie and Daily Show host Stewart, also from New Jersey, are at opposite ends of the political spectrum. But they agreed on two things on last night's show. Firstly that agreed they 'can't wait, and know, that the great state of New Jersey will bounce back stronger than ever' from the devastation wrought by Sandy. Secondly, both men 'would very much like' Bruce Springsteen to hug them. The New Jersey governor has attended over 130 Bruce Springsteen shows. Here he shows off another concert ticket for a gig at Giants Stadium . Christie then told of his experience last Friday. He turned around backstage to find Springsteen standing behind him, offering a handshake. The governor accepted, then the singer said 'Come on, give me a hug.' Stewart inquired into Christie's hugging technique, asking if he also gave the singer a pat on the back during the embrace. Christie confirmed that there was no patting involved - the hug was 'slow dance' style. According to Christie, Springsteen then said: 'It's official. We're friends.' Chris Christie's Springsteen obsession is well-documented - he sang Thunder Road on TV with Jimmy Fallon . Bruce Springsteen campaigned for President Obama during last month's elections . Stewart moved on to ask Christie about relief efforts in New Jersey, pointing out the irony of the governor bashing President Obama's leadership before the storm, then praising Obama fulsomely after the disaster. 'It tells me people have different skill sets at different times,' Christie said. When a picture was taken of Christie with his eyes shut at a Springsteen concert in April, it was claimed that governor had fallen asleep. Instead Christie claimed that he was merely closing his eyes to better enjoy Rocky Road, a song he describes as 'spiritual.' At the time he stated: 'I have never fallen asleep at a Bruce Springsteen show, I will never fall asleep during a Bruce Springsteen show, my wife is probably afraid that I'm more likely to die during a Bruce Springsteen show than fall asleep.' Chris Christie claims he is now 'friends' with the legendary musician .","New Jersey governor at last gets some acknowledgement from his hero .

Roy Keane has reignited his war of words with Sir Alex Ferguson with a withering series of remarks about the former Manchester United boss. Keane opens up on his bitter exit from Old Trafford and the breakdown of his relationship with Ferguson in an ITV documentary to be screened on Tuesday night. He talks of Fergie’s methods of 'power and control' and his 'massive ego', hails Brian Clough as 'without a doubt' the best manager he worked for and omits Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes and Gary Neville when choosing the finest United team from his former team-mates. Biting back: Roy Keane has laid into Sir Alex Ferguson, Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville and more . Keane brands Neville ‘the weakest link’ and, in reference to Giggs, says: ‘Having a great career doesn’t mean you’re a great player.’ Included in his team instead of Fergie’s favourites are rebels who fell out with the former United manager, including Jaap Stam, Paul Ince, David Beckham and Ruud van Nistelrooy. ‘You don’t win league titles by having choirboys in your dressing room,’ says Keane. ‘These boys did challenge the manager in different ways. Becks challenged the manager but because you marry a certain woman it doesn’t mean you’re challenging the manager. ‘The manager’s got to understand that. We’ve got different personalities in our dressing room but maybe that’s why we’re winning trophies.’ Egotistical? Roy Keane denies much of what Sir Alex Ferguson said about him in his autobiography . Rift: The relationship between David Beckham and Sir Alex Ferguson declined until Beckham moved on . Clashes: Ruud van Nistelrooy and Jaap Stam (right) were also among those to fall out with Sir Alex Ferguson . Ferguson’s retirement earlier this year has enabled Keane to return and watch the team, eight years after his United career ended. ‘I felt raw when I left,’ says Keane. ‘I’ve eased off now a bit in terms of the bad feeling I had towards them. ‘It helps that Ferguson has gone and I’ve got a couple of season tickets with my son and we go and watch them as much as we can. ‘So I have that warmth towards Man United once again and it did leave me for a couple of years, which I feel bad saying because in every minute of every day I spent at that football club I really enjoyed it. I feel very fortunate to have played for them.’ Influential: But Roy Keane left Manchester United in 2005/2006, and admits he shed tears over leaving . Not a great player: Ryan Giggs (right) remains a Premier League player with Manchester United at the age of 40 . It was November 2005, when Ferguson summoned the Irishman and told him it was time to go following the storm which surrounded Keane's critical but never-to-be-broadcast comments about the team on MUTV, the club's in-house channel. ‘The manager told me we’d come to the end and I said, “You’re right”,’ says Keane. ‘I’d obviously lost respect for him and he’d lost respect for me. What would be best for Man United, if they thought I was some sort of loose cannon, was to leave. I got my boots and drove out. Don’t think I’m some sort of machine here. I was upset of course, and I did shed a few tears in my car outside the training ground for about two minutes, but also I told myself I needed to get on with my life. ‘Alex Ferguson thanked me for my 11-and-a-half years at the club and I had to remind him I’d been at Man United for 12-and-a-half years. Again, I think this was all part of the game, you know. Two words the manager spoke to me about a number of times were “control” and “power” and that was how he worked. We can still see that now even though he’s not a manager. I don’t think that will ever leave him. Fall out: Patrick Vieira (left) and Roy Keane once famously clashed in the tunnel before United played Arsenal . ‘There is massive ego involved in that you have power and control over people and you try and have it even when you’re not working with them.’ Keane criticises Ferguson’s conduct in his racehorse dispute with former United shareholder John Magnier, saying: ‘If people don’t think that had a negative effect on the club then they’re living in cuckoo land.’ And he rejects accusations from Ferguson’s book that he was a fading force on the pitch and trying to assume managerial responsibilities. He also denies the manager’s version of events regarding the MUTV interview. ‘Just because Alex Ferguson says it doesn’t mean it’s the truth,’ says Keane. ‘Really, what would have helped everybody is if they had just played the damn video. As they are now: But when they played, Roy Keane feared Gary Neville (right) was United's weak link . ‘The manager has accused me of trying to manage Man United behind his back but what I did do, I managed the dressing room. That was my job. I tried to nail players who stepped out of line. ‘I never felt for one second I was more important than the manager. Absolute nonsense. ‘I could have played for Man United easily for another couple of years in the middle of the park.’ Keane describes his relationship these days with Ferguson as ‘obviously non-existent’. Asked if he felt let down, he says: ‘Nothing surprises me with that man.’ Asked who was the best manager he played for, Keane answers: ‘Without a doubt, Brian Clough.’ The questioner adds: ‘Not Sir Alex Ferguson,’ and he replies: ‘You asked me the question, I answered you.’ Managerial mastermind: Roy Keane insists that Brian Clough (right) is the best manager he has worked under . The documentary Keane and Vieira: Best of Enemies will be shown on Tuesday at 10pm on ITV4. It is compelling viewing as the former captains of Manchester United and Arsenal meet to discuss the days when their teams would fight, sometimes literally, for the Barclays Premier League title. Among the epic games recounted is the highly charged clash at Highbury in 2005, defined by a  pre-match row between the two captains in the Highbury tunnel, triggered when Patrick Vieira tried to intimidate Gary Neville. ‘What really annoyed me that night was . . . that you were picking on Gary,’ says Keane. ‘I was looking at Nicky Butt and Wes Brown and I’m thinking you were almost picking on the weakest link. ‘So that’s what got my back up.’ Head to head: Roy Keane and Patrick Vieira repeatedly clashed both on and off the field . Talking point: One of the great debates of the Premier League era is who of the two was the better player . Vieira bemoans Arsenal’s lack of leadership in the trophy-free years since his departure and reveals how he tried to persuade Arsene Wenger not to sell Ashley Cole. ‘I tried to fight it a little bit because I wanted him to stay,’ explains Vieira. ‘Ashley was supposed to be the next Arsenal captain because he was a player from the youth, grew up at the club and to let him go and see him go, I was disappointed.’ Most compelling of all, however, is Keane’s assessment of Ferguson.","Fergie had a 'massive ego' and used methods of 'power and control'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 13:31 EST, 6 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:21 EST, 6 November 2013 . U.S. Special Forces were complicit in the murder, torture and abuse of at least 18 Afghan villagers and should be investigated, according to human rights advocates. Human Rights Watch has called on the U.S. government to probe new allegations that military personnel 'participated in or were otherwise responsible for' the killings in Nerkh district, Wardak province, in late 2012 and early 2013. While an Afghan interpreter working for the U.S. unit was arrested in July over the murders, the victims' families claim U.S. forces knew about the killings and did nothing to stop them. Vanished: A missing-persons poster, with pictures of nine men who their relatives say were last seen being arrested by U.S. special operations forces in Wardak province, is held by a villager in Afghanistan in March . Allegations of killings in Nerkh first emerged in November 2012. Local residents claimed the murders were connected to operations by a new U.S. Special Forces unit in the Wardak district, known as ODA 3124. These U.S. Army Green Berets were trained to wage unconventional warfare, according to Rolling Stone, replacing big Army units in Afghanistan 'to hunt the enemy and stiffen the resolve of government forces'. Wardak villagers claimed members of ODA 3124 worked with locals on the American payroll to quietly abduct local men and boys and interrogate them in secret. In February, the body of a man named Nasratullah was found in Nerkh with his throat slit. His family said that he had been arrested by U.S. forces. The shocking discovery sparked fierce protests in Wardak, with Afghan President Hamid Karzai ordering U.S. forces to leave the province. After the team withdrew from Nerkh in April, a shepherd found human remains near the team’s former base perimeter. Villagers began digging in the area and over the next two months, the bodies of 10 Afghan men who had earlier been taken into custody by U.S. forces were found. According to Afghan government documents, at least eight other men had been killed in operations linked to ODA 3124 – a total of 18 deaths. A team of American Special Forces arrived in Nerkh, a district of Wardak province, Afghanistan (pictured) late last year . Angry: Hundreds of villagers from Afghanistan's Wardak province protested about the abuses, prompting Afghan President Hamid Karzai to order U.S. forces to leave the province . In July, Afghan officials arrested local translator Zikria Kandahari who was working with the U.S. unit over the murders. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Kandahari said he did not commit any abuses and that ODA 3124 was responsible for the alleged tortures and murders. U.S. officials have denied any involvement, despite opening a criminal investigation in July after the International Committee of the Red Cross brought forth new evidence. Meanwhile, witnesses and the families of the 10 men whose bodies were found have told the United Nations, Afghan officials and journalists from Rolling Stone that Kandahari did not act alone. In one case, a man detained by U.S. forces said he witnessed Kandahari execute his neighbor, a man named Gul Rahim, in front of U.S. personnel, who did nothing to stop him and did not object afterward. The man also said that American troops and Kandahari beat him severely, according to Human Rights Watch. Rolling Stone reported human remains were found in six different sites around the former U.S. base. The first corpse, identified as Sayed Mohammad, was found in an irrigation ditch by farmers. Other remains had been scavenged by wild dogs in the area, while others showed traces of burning. Even if Afghan personnel are found to have carried out the killings and mistreatment, U.S. personnel can bear criminal responsibility for war crimes. They are responsible if they aided and abetted, ordered, or knew or should have known . about crimes committed by their subordinates and took no action, according to Human Rights Watch. 'Simply blaming one Afghan interpreter for 18 deaths discredits the U.S. commitment to get at the truth,' a spokesman said. 'The U.S. investigation . should go beyond the people who carried out the killings and examine who . may have assisted in the crimes or failed to take action to stop it.'

Off the hook: John Christopher Lo was arrested in 2010 for sending sexually-explicit text messages and pictures to a former student of his, but likely won't face prosecution with the Texas Court of Appeals ruling . The highest court in Texas has ruled that while it's illegal to engage in sexual activities with a minor, it's OK to talk about it with them. State lawyers who argued in favor of keeping the 2005 statute said that without it 'perverts will be free to bombard our children with salacious emails and text messages, and parents and law enforcement would be unable to stop it'. But the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals ruled unanimously that the law is in violation of the First Amendment right to free speech. State laws are able to limit the First Amendment right to free speech but only if they serve a compelling state interest and are narrowly drawn to limit their impact. In her opinion, Judge Cathy Cochran, explained that the law met the compelling state interest in protecting children from child predators. But the law wasn't narrowly written enough and instead covered 'a whole cornucopia of ""titillating talk"" or ""dirty talk,"" including sexually explicit literature such as ""Lolita,"" ""50 Shades of Grey,"" ""Lady Chatterley's Lover"" and Shakespeare's ""Troilus and Cressida.""' Judge Cochran listed other examples . of 'sexually explicit television shows, movies and performances' that . would be illegal under the law, such as Janet Jackson's 2004 Super Bowl . performance in which she exposed her right breast, and Miley Cyrus' recent appearance on the 2013 Video Music Awards. Unconstitutional: The Court of Appeals ruled that the 2005 statute was in violation of the First Amendment right to free speech. They said it was too general and could be applied to books like '50 Shades of Grey' (left) and Miley Cyrus' recent VMA performance (right) 'In sum, everything (the law) prohibits and punishes is speech and is either already prohibited by other statutes - such as obscenity, disturbing harmful materials to minors, solicitation of a minor, or child pornography - or is constitutionally protected,' she wrote. One man probably celebrating the ruling is former-teacher John Christopher Lo of Harris County, Texas who was arrested in 2010 after sending sexual text messages and pictures to a former student. Lo's attorney, Mark Bennett, believes the 53-year-old is now off the hook. The court dismissed a pending indictment against Lo in their decision. His trial had been delayed while the law's constitutionality was challenged. 'Parents have the job of dealing with this. This is not the government's job,' Bennett told the Houston Chronicle. 'Keep track of who your kids are communicating with and teach your kids what's appropriate and what's not.'","The Texas Court of Appeals ruled yesterday that a 2005 statute prohibiting salacious communications to minors is illegal .

Floatation: Twitter is expected to be valued at £7 billion despite never making a profit . Twitter is expected to be valued at £7billion when its shares are offered on Wall Street before the end of the year. Launched in 2006, it has gone from a simple messaging site to a forum where everybody from world leaders to celebrities can write to hundreds of thousands of followers at once. More than 500 million tweets are posted every day, but documents sent to the US market regulator ahead of the flotation reveal that it has never made a profit. Revenues tripled to almost £200million last year but it still lost £50million. Twitter said it expected to go into the black by the end of next year. A £7 billion listing would make it  bigger in value than companies such as Morrisons and EasyJet. In excess of 300 billion tweets have been sent since the service, which allows users to publish notes of 140 characters or fewer instantly, launched. More than 250 million people use the site every month - with 100 million posting something every day. But it has also attracted internet trolls spewing hatred and bile. Earlier this year two female British MPs received rape and death threats from anonymous users on the site. More than 64,000 people signed a petition in the wake of the incident calling for a ‘zero tolerance’ policy on abuse by the site’s owners, who stand to make millions from the float. Now it is preparing to offer shares on Wall Street from as early as November. Despite being free to use, the company is able to rake in millions of pounds selling advertising. Last year its revenues tripled to almost £200million. But despite the increase it still made a loss of £50million. In the documents the company said it expected to go into the black by the end of next year.

A secret diary kept by fugitive terror suspect Samantha Lewthwaite has revealed her advice for being a good wife and having a happy marriage. The 'white widow' of the one of the July 7 bombers wrote how she juggled family life with her jihad views while allegedly plotting terrorrist  attacks . On marriage she says: 'When a man comes home - wife beautiful, food prepared, kids clean... immediately he will forget the pain of his day. He will always want to come home.' Fugitive: Samantha Lewthwaite wrote in her diary about how to be a good wife while allegedly plotting terror attacks . Lewthwaite advises women that a good wife should 'protect your hubby's money' and under the heading 'The art of saying sorry' she says women should not be stubborn. Extracts seen by the Sunday Times, also reveal her plans to open a juice bar and frozen yoghurt stall with 'slimming smoothies' called Peanut Butter Bomb and the Mango Bang. The diary was found in a police raid at a villa in the Kenyan resort of Mombasa where she was living with her four children before going on the run in December 2011. The 29-year-old British Muslim convert is the world's most wanted woman after being accused of allegedly ordering the killings of two radical Muslim clerics, two Protestant preachers, and three others with links to terror-group al-Shabaab. Warrant: Two faces of Samantha Lewthwaite who has been on the run with her children since 2011 . In her diary, Lewthwaite, from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, covered her 'to do list' for the juice bar with heart-shaped doodles and a drawing of a glass topped with a cocktail umbrella. She priced the yoghurt at one scoop for 100 Kenyan shillings (70p) or four scoops for 300 shillings. Lewthwaite described her 'Pregisize' classes for expectant mothers as 'specifically designed aerobic workouts with added strength and toning which are 100% safe. Each member would get a 10 per cent discount, a 'stylish T-shirt', a monthly newsletter and healthy recipes. The paper quotes her diary: 'Let us help you to maintain a healthy body and mind during this spiritual journey.' Attack: The collapsed car park of the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi where al-Shabab gunmen killed more than 60 people . Wounded: A victim is carried away from the mall. The siege, which lasted several days, ended after soldiers stormed the building and the roof collapsed . Lewthwaite is the widow of 7/7 bomber Germaine Lindsay, who blew himself up on a Piccadilly Line train between King's Cross St Pancras and Russell Square stations. She was the daughter of a former soldier before converting to Islam. The convert is linked to the Westgate Mall massacre in Nairobi in which 67 people were killed, and is thought to be hiding in Somalia. Interpol issued a 'Red Notice' warrant for her arrest shortly after the attacks for terrorist offences in Mombasa dating back to 2011.","Samantha Lewthwaite also wrote of her recipe for a happy marriage:  'Wife beautiful, food prepared, kids clean, immediately he will forget the pain of his day'

A mother who was prescribed drugs to combat a rare autoimmune condition made her shed her whole skin - like a human snake. Mary Holder, 46, lost 98 per cent of her skin and almost died when her body burst into blisters and burns after she took medication to treat lupus. Called Quinoric, it was recommended to the mother-of-two even though medics knew it could cause the painful skin condition Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS). Warning: Mary Holder lost 98 per cent of her surface skin after she took medication to treat lupus. She has campaigned to have the skin reaction added to the list of possible adverse side-effects . But even doctors were stunned by her violent reaction, which even made her eye balls peel, and all of her hair fall out. She was rushed to hospital with third degree burns, which were so severe medics could only describe her as a “walking open wound”. At its worst, Mary was placed in isolation and warned by doctors to say her final goodbyes to her family. When she miraculously pulled through, her body had been so badly damaged she had to learn to walk again. But determined to stop anyone else suffering her agony, she launched a bid to force warnings to be added to all Quinoric packaging. Now drugs chiefs have asked the pharmaceutical firm, which makes Quinoric, to add warnings to their packaging about the dangers of the excruciating snake skin illness, SJS. Mary said she refused to give in even though all the liquid in her body dried up - leaving her no tears to cry. Worst pain of my life: Mary was told she could die but refused to give up . She said: 'It is the worst pain of my life, your body wants to die. But when you are told to get your family around you because this could be it, you find strength from somewhere. 'It is hard to explain but I wasn’t going to die and I wasn’t going to let it beat me. 'I refused to say goodbye to my family and my husband stayed by my bed every minute of the day. 'It was exceptionally difficult for my family to cope with, my daughter was so traumatised by the sight of me she only visited me once, she thought she would never see me again. 'I nearly went blind, my hair fell out by the hand-full and was covered in three degree burns, I thought I would never feel well again. I felt like I had been scorched and set fire too. 'The consultant who prescribed the drug to me was shocked to see my condition. He told me, ‘Well Mary, you look like you have been dropped in a bath of acid’.' Mary, of Chichester, Sussex, was diagnosed with lupus in January 2011 - a condition where the immune system starts to attack healthy cells, tissue and organs. She was prescribed Quinoric by medics to help treat it, but after taking just four tablets her lips became swollen and she suffered shortness of breath. Mary scanned the medical advice leaflet and stopped taking the medication when a painful rash began to develop on her body. She made constant visits to her GP, who prescribed steroids, and applied dressings to the blisters and sent her home. But by the time a doctor finally diagnosed her with Stevens-Johnson syndrome Mary was in constant agony and could barely walk. Some of the medication Mary needed to take following a reaction to the drug Quinoric . Mary has been left with significant scarring . Her husband of 27 years, forest manager Michael, 48, rushed her to St Richards hospital, Chichester, where she was placed in isolation room to help combat the infection. By February 1, 2011, she had shed all but two per cent of her skin and she was advised to say her final goodbyes to her children Leanne, 18, and Christopher, 23. Incredibly, after a week in intensive care Mary pulled through, but is still battling to recover from the lasting effects of the illness. Following the illness, Mary launched 15 month battle for warnings about the dangers of SJS be included on the drugs packing and in the accompanying user information. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MRHA) has now asked Quinoric manufacturer, Bristol Laboratories, to create a new leaflet highlighting the risk of side affects with their drug. Mary Holder in intensive care, suffering from Stevens-Johnson Syndrome . Mary added: 'I look at my body and it does get me down, the scaring on my legs is horrific. I am lucky to be alive but my body will never been the same again. 'We are having to move as I can am no longer financially able to help support the family and I just feel like because of me my family is being broken up, prodded and poked. 'My illness put all of them through so much I wouldn’t wish that on my worst enemy.' A spokesperson for MRHA said: 'We are sorry to hear that Ms Holder has suffered serious side-effects from her medication. 'Stevens-Johnson .

Rebekah Brooks allegedly planned to cover up her involvement in phone hacking with an operation inspired by war film 'Where Eagles Dare' Rebekah Brooks tried to cover up her involvement in phone hacking using an operation inspired by the war film Where Eagles Dare, her trial heard yesterday. The former News International chief executive is said to have embarked on a campaign of self-preservation in the dying days of the News of the World. The 45-year-old is accused of hiding incriminating evidence from police and attempting to pin blame on her colleagues before the tabloid was shut down. The Old Bailey was told she enlisted the help of her racehorse trainer husband Charlie Brooks, a team of security staff and her chauffeur. On the day of her arrest, her 50-year-old husband and News International head of security Mark Hanna allegedly coordinated an elaborate operation, codenamed Blackhawk, removing computer evidence from her Oxfordshire and London homes – hours before police searched them. While Brooks was being interviewed by detectives, her husband was seen on CCTV stashing a bag and a laptop behind some bins in the car park below their Chelsea Harbour flat. Hanna, 50, and two other security guards then allegedly retrieved the haul and took it along with other bags of evidence to the newspaper offices in Wapping on July 17, 2011. After the police searches were over, . her lieutenants returned to dump a bag containing computers behind some . bins in the underground car park of Brooks’s flat, using a pizza . delivery as cover, jurors were told.

Jill Morin of Raleigh, N.C., is one of hundreds of thousands of people across the U.S. with a pre-existing chronic condition who will see their high risk health insurance coverage dissolve by the year's end. Morin, 42, has a severe heart condition and is currently covered by her state's pool, but she has not attempted to enroll in the healthcare.gov federal website, otherwise known as Obamacare. 'It's the unknown, the uncertainty that gets to me,' the mother-of-one said. 'I don't know what my cost will be at the end of the day. Jill Morin, right, poses for photos with her son Kyle at their home in Raleigh, N.C. She will see her high risk insurance pool coverage dissolve by the year's end . 'I don't know if my two cardiologists and my procedures are going to be covered under the plan. There just isn't enough information on that website.' But, she said, she has no choice. She must pick a plan soon because she can't afford to go without. She plans to go to an insurance broker for advice, then contact the federal call center to bypass the online marketplace altogether. State officials throughout the nation have been scrambling to figure out how to help people like Morin. Last week, the board of the Oregon Medical Insurance Pool — which covers about 11,000 people — ordered the state to create a contingency plan for its members because the state's online exchange still has not enrolled a single person. For now, the only way to enroll for coverage in Oregon is to fill out a 19-page paper application. The state has so far received just 7,300 such applications from all Oregonians, not just those in the pool, but it has not yet processed any of them. Morin suffers from a serious heart condition and suffered a cardiac arrest in 2009 . The process takes up to several weeks, so no one has completed it and successfully enrolled, Cover Oregon spokesman Michael Cox said. Oregon pool administrator Don Myron said he hopes to speed up enrollment for its members by mailing them a paper application and following up to make sure they filled it out. In Indiana, the Department of Insurance extended the high-risk pool coverage until at least Jan. 31 because of difficulties with the federal health insurance exchange. Its pool covers about 6,800 people. The move was crucial, officials said, because people in the pool were not able to schedule treatments without proof of health coverage for the coming year. Indiana will spend $6.3 million to extend the coverage. Morin and hundreds of thousands of other people with preexisting chronic conditions are covered through high risk insurance pools . In Wisconsin, the Health Insurance Risk-Sharing Plan that covers 24,500 people is rolling out an outreach effort to make sure their members are signed up by the deadline, chief executive Amie Goldman said. The state created a worksheet and directories of carriers to help people prepare for enrollment, has sent postcard reminders and is answering questions through its Facebook page and weekly newsletters. Many of those in high-risk pools across the nation will be shopping for insurance for the first time in years. 'Even if the technology was really perfect, it would still be hard to sign up because many people who are really sick don't respond well to change,' said Linda Nilsen Solares, executive director of Portland-based Project Access NOW, which connects uninsured people with care. 'Many of them are just trying to get through the day.'","Hundreds of thousands of people will lose coverage by the year's end .

Despite the success of the wind-up radio, the 75-year-old says he has received very little of the profits. Trevor Baylis, pictured in his workshop at his home on Eel Pie Island, Twickenham, said despite the success of his wind-up radio invention he is now living in poverty and will now need to sell or remortgage his beloved home . He claims a quirk in patent law meant . the business which manufactured the radio was able to tweak his design . and take control of the product. Now Mr Baylis, who was awarded the OBE in 1997, wants the Government to introduce stronger legal protection for inventors. Under current laws, patent infringement is a civil rather than a criminal offence. The pensioner, who lives alone on Eel .

The inventor lives in a one-bedroom home overlooking the Thames with his pet labrador. He built the house, which boasts its . own mooring berth and a five-metre swimming pool in the entrance hall, . in the 1970s for £20,000. A keen jazz fan, he was drawn to Eel .

Mr Baylis, who was recently named . among the 50 greatest inventors in British history, said:  ‘If people . are not going to be rewarded for their inventions, then why should they . invent at all? This nation was built on inventions and manufacturing. He created the radio so third world countries could learn about AIDS prevention without needing batteries . ‘People such as James Dyson have done . very well, but not many of us have all the business skills we need to . bring a product to market. Students need to be taught about intellectual . property in schools.’ After inventing the wind-up radio, Mr . Baylis went on to produce wind-up versions of a torch, mobile phone . charger and MP3 player. He has invented more than 250 products, . including a shoe that generates enough electricity as you walk to charge . a mobile phone. He called on the Government to . introduce tougher laws, in line with the US and Germany, which would . allow people who steal intellectual property to be jailed. Mr Baylis added: ‘The Government . should offer financial support, advice on developing people’s . inventions, and help to keep that manufacturing here in the UK. ‘It would make money for the British economy.’ The wind-up radio inspired other inventions like the wind-up torch and wind-up phone charger .","Trevor Baylis claims he has no choice but to sell or remortgage his house .

The villa at Tivoli, near Rome, was built by Emperor Hadrian in the 2nd Century AD and was made up of 30 buildings such as palaces, living quarters, spas, pavilions and libraries, each surrounded by ornate gardens, pools and fountains. Archaeologists have mapped more than a mile of tunnels, right, discovered beneath Hadrian's Villa in Rome used to transport slaves, cattle and food out of sight from the Emperor Hadrian. The main tunnel, pictured left, runs for half a mile to a 700 metre circular spur that may have been used to turn carts around . This map shows the layout of Hadrian's villa estate. The first tunnels to be discovered at the start of this century are marked in blue and travel from the Piazza to the Grand Trapeze. The second, red tunnels travel away from the Grand Trapeze. The green roads travel underground from the entrance hall to the piazza. The yellow line is the newly-discovered tunnel that is 2.4-metres wide and dubbed The Great Underground Road . The main tunnel, mapped by caver Marco Placidi and a team from the Sotteranei di Roma association of archaeospeleologists including Vittoria Fressi, is 10-foot wide, runs for more than half a mile in a north-easterly direction before switching south and leads to a 700-metre circular spur. Experts believe this spur may have been used as a turning circle for the carts and wagons. The passage has been dubbed Strafa Carrabile, which means Great Underground Road in Italian, and is larger than the other tunnels previously discovered under the estate. It was uncovered when archaeologists found a hole buried beneath bushes and plants along a pathway to the main gallery. Because some sections of the tunnel are blocked by debris and rocks that have fallen into them over time, the archaeologists also used wire-controlled robots fitted with cameras to explore regions they couldn't reach. Another, larger tunnel was also found during the exploration that is 16-foot wide and could have been used as a dual road. The main tunnel, mapped by caver Marco Placidi, pictured, and a team from the Sotteranei di Roma association runs in a north-easterly direction before switching south beneath the 296 acres of the Hadrian Villa's estate . Hadrian's Villa was built at Tibur, which is now known as Tivoli, around 20 miles to the east of Rome. It was used as a retreat for Roman Emperor Hadrian during 2nd Century AD. The villa was started in 117AD. Towards the end of his reign, Hadrian governed the empire from the villa and built a court in order to have official meetings. When the . Roman Empire fell the palace was looted and damaged but the underground . network is 'almost intact'. The estate is made of over 30 building covering around 296 acres and includes palaces, thermae's (spas), theatres, temples, libraries, slave and courtier quarters. There is also a pool and an artificial grotto named Canopus and Serapeum, respectively (pictured). It was named after the Egyptian city of Canopus where a temple, called Serapeum, was dedicated to the god Serapis. In 1998, archaeologists discovered a temple built in honour of god Antinous. The villa was declared a World Heritage . Site by Unesco in 1999 and officials are working to clear the tunnels . and offer tours of the passageways by the end of the year. However, there was too much soil and debris in the tunnel for the explorers to enter and will be cleared at a later date to see where it leads to. The villa was declared a World Heritage Site by Unesco in 1999 and officials are working to clear the tunnels so they can offer tours of the passageways by the end of the year. Archaeologists realised there was a network of roads under the estate because wells were situated along the paths every 50ft in a uniform pattern. It was originally believed that a single road travelled from the terrace of the Venus of Cnidus statue in the grounds to the circular spur. The new tunnel entrance discovered suggests that there were also alternative underground routes. Other discoveries include the footprint of a baby on the cover plate at the end of one tunnel as well as a shell from the Red Sea found beneath the Serapeum, or religious temple. Some of the tunnels under Hadrian's Villa were too small for the team to fully explore so the archaeospeleologists used wire-mounted robots fitted with cameras to track and map the areas they couldn't reach .

'Yes, some drugged up guys were being belligerent a**es to my crew for hours in the morning of our first shoot day in Hong Kong,' explained the Pearl Harbor director on MichaelBay.com . 'One guy rolled metal carts into some of my actors trying to shake us down for thousands of dollars to not play his loud music or hit us with bricks.

'He walked right up to me and tried to smack my face, but I ducked, threw the air unit on the floor and pushed him away,' explained Bay about the attack that was first reported by TMZ. On location: Bay, centre, with his film crew. A man apparently swung at the director with an air conditioning unit . 'That’s when the security jumped on him. But it took seven big guys to subdue him.

Support for shops: Communities Secretary Eric Pickles wants to help shoppers and motorists by relaxing parking charges . Drivers could be granted a ‘grace period’ to park outside the shops for a few minutes without paying, under plans being considered by Eric Pickles. The Local Government secretary said he wanted to end the ‘war on the motorist’ which is putting people off shopping in their town centres. He said parking charges had become ‘ridiculously high’ and drivers were being used as ‘cash cows’ by local councils. Mr Pickles said: ‘We are looking at more ways to curb ridiculously high parking charges and over-zealous traffic wardens who pounce on those simply popping into their local shop for a pint of milk or to buy a paper. ‘This overly aggressive stance towards the motorist is not good for the high street. Councils should be supporting their local high streets and wider economy, not using drivers as cash cows.’ Sources in his department said the plans under consideration include limits on how much councils can levy, and ‘grace periods’ on parking spaces for quick trips to town centres. A few councils already allow drivers to park free for up to 30 minutes near their local shops, but it is understood similar schemes will be implemented more widely. Mr Pickles warned two years ago that town centres had become ‘ghost towns’ as people were put off shopping there by aggressive parking rules and instead turning to out-of-town supermarkets. His comments chime with the Mary Portas review, an independent report commissioned by the Government into the future of the high street, which stressed that cheap or free parking was key to the local economy. The Department for Communities and Local Government can only issue guidelines to councils, but Mr Pickles said: ‘We are offering guidance about being reasonable. By and large councils obey guidance.’ Opportunistic: The Local Government secretary said he wanted to end the ¿war on the motorist¿ which is putting people off shopping in town . Whitehall planning rules brought in by Labour in 2001 restricted the number of parking spaces in new developments which triggered an increase in parking restrictions. Councils were discouraged from setting lower parking charges to attract more shoppers into town centres. But the Government say this unfairly penalised drivers and instead drove them away. Between 2000 and 2007, average parking charges jumped 40 per cent from 86p for two hours to £1.21. Research has shown that a relatively small increase in the parking charges can result in dramatic fall-offs in visitors to shops. An AA spokesperson said: ‘It is well documented that when you have high parking charges somewhere people don’t go there, and that has an impact on business and trade. ‘Some town centres will give you 30 minutes free, so you can go into the bank or drop off a prescription and we think other authorities should see the merit of that. ‘If it is well controlled, there will be quick turnover of spaces. People say it creates traffic, but you have balance that with the impact on the local economy to get people in to the shops. ‘They could also follow the example of some other European and build large underground car parks where appropriate. You cannot punish people with pricing. Parking problems: Mr Pickles criticised high parking charges and over-zealous traffic wardens . ‘Fuel prices are already having a big impact on people using their cars, so any extra charges drive people into out of town shops where parking is free.’ But Peter Box of the Local Government Association said the Government’s own figures show parking charges rose by just 1.25 per cent - less than inflation - over the past two years. He said: ‘Claims councils are hiking up parking charges to make money off motorists are not borne out by the facts. ‘Regulating parking is essential to keep traffic flowing, pedestrians and motorists safe, roads clear for emergency services and business deliveries, and ensuring people can park near their homes or local shops. ‘What works in one town or city might not in another, depending on factors such as population, weight of traffic, road layout, number of car parks and who runs them. It is for councils, in consultation with residents and businesses, to decide what works best for their communities.’","Eric Pickles said parking charges had become ‘ridiculously high’

People whose loved ones fall ill or are disabled should be given paid 'care leave', Andrew Marr's wife has said after she spent months caring for him following his stroke. Jackie Ashley, who is also a journalist, became the BBC presenter's full-time carer as he battled to recover from a near-fatal stroke in January. She has joined forces with a charity to demand at least five days a year of emergency leave for family carers who have nowhere else to turn. Jackie Ashley, left, became her husband's full-time carer after the BBC presenter had a near-fatal stroke in January. She has joined the charity Carers UK to call for at least five days' paid leave for carers a year . The politics presenter took nine months before he was fit enough to return to the airwaves, walking with a cane when he eventually reappeared into public life. His wife helped him with time-consuming physio exercises, eating three meals a day, driving to hospital appointments, changing shoes and tying laces. In a Daily Mail column earlier this year, Mr Marr wrote: 'It’s toughest, of course, for the patient, but it’s tough and tiring for the carer too. Andrew Marr's wife helped him with with physio exercises, hospital trips and tying shoelaces . 'Having helped look after her elderly father before his death last year, Jackie had some idea of the pressures of caring. But neither of us had appreciated what a huge social and political problem has been quietly building up as our population ages.' More than 6.5 million people are carers in Britain, many of them completely unpaid despite having demanding full-time jobs. But more than two million have had to give up work to be carers, according to the charity Carers UK, costing the economy £5.3 billion a year. A staggering 89 per cent of people would back a change in the law for move to be put in place, according to a YouGov poll. More than half of those polled for the charity (57 per cent) supported a right to paid leave while another 35 per cent supported unpaid leave. Only one in 25 people were against giving carers the right to time off work. Ms Ashley, a columnist for The Guardian and a BBC radio presenter, said: 'Just as maternity leave once seemed . unthinkable but is now widely accepted, so the right to care leave needs . to become part of the pattern of employment. 'Our ageing society means . that more and more people will become carers, but often only for a . limited period of time. It is madness that so many carers lose their . jobs forever.' The call is being led by Carers UK, which said five days' leave a year should be the minimum legal right, with a public debate on offering longer periods of time off. Chief executive Heléna Herklots said: 'The millions of people caring for parents with dementia, ill partners or disabled sons and daughters are left using up all their holiday leave, can often become exhausted and many feel forced to give up work altogether. 'This is unsustainable, and families, businesses and the economy will pay an increasing price as growing numbers of stressed workers burn out trying to juggle work and family.' Shaken: It took nine months for Andrew Marr, who walked with a cane, to return to the airwaves . The charity claimed Britain is falling behind 'care leave' policies in other countries including Germany, Canada, Japan, Australia, France, Italy, the U.S., Belgium, Poland, Ireland, Taiwan and New Zealand. The call comes as world powers meet for the G8 Dementia Summit today in London. British workers are only allowed a small amount of 'emergency leave', usually limited to a day or two if a loved one has a crisis.","Jackie Ashley, a journalist, quit to look after BBC presenter full-time .

The first same-sex weddings in England and Wales will take place from March 29, 2014 - months earlier than had been expected. When the highly-contentious same-sex marriage Bill cleared the Commons in July, couples hoping to tie the knot were told they would have to wait until next summer. But Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said next March would be a ‘real moment for celebration’ when the first weddings are held. First: Same-sex weddings will be able to take place in England and Wales from March 29 next year . Couples wishing to be among the first to marry will need formally to give notice of their intention to marry on March 13. Mr Clegg said: ‘This is the news many couples have been waiting for. After a long and important battle, this is a wonderful step forward for equality. ‘Love is the same, gay or straight, so it’s only right that the civil institution should be the same. ‘Next March will be a real moment for celebration as same sex couples finally get the chance to express their love through marriage.’ Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: 'Love is the same, gay or straight' More than 130 Tory MPs voted against the bill but was passed with the support of the Lib Dems and Labour. David Cameron has admitted gay marriage has been deeply unpopular within Tory ranks, but insisted it was the right thing to do. When the controversial legislation became law, he spoke of his pride that gay boys at school worried about being bullied would see Parliament declaring that ‘their love is the same as everyone else’s love’. Tory Culture Secretary Maria Miller said: ‘Marriage is one of our most important institutions, and from March 29, 2014 it will be open to everyone, irrespective of whether they fall in love with someone of the same sex or opposite sex. ‘This is just another step in the evolution of marriage and I know that many couples up and down the country will be hugely excited that they can now plan for their big day and demonstrate their love and commitment to each other by getting married.’ Ms Miller said she was ‘working hard’ to ensure that couples wishing to convert civil partnerships into marriages - and married people wanting to change their legal gender while remaining married - will be able to do so before the end of next year. Same-sex couples who married abroad under foreign law and are currently treated as civil partners will be recognised as being married in England and Wales from March 2014. Those wishing to take part in same-sex weddings in some British consulates and armed forces bases overseas or in military chapels will have to wait until June. Bob Woollard, chairman of the . organisation Conservative Grassroots, said the timing of the first gay . marriages was a gift to the UK Independence Party, which claims to have . attracted large numbers of Tory activists in the wake of the gay . marriage row. Mr Woollard . said: ‘Once again we have a tiny metropolitan elite at the top of the . party rushing things through without adequate consultation with ordinary . members. 'They don’t listen and they seem to go out of their way to upset people unnecessarily.’ Gay couples had been told the first weddings could not happen until next summer, but the date has been brought forward . Ben Summerskill, chief executive of gay rights campaign group Stonewall, said he was ‘delighted’ at the announcement, which he said was ‘particularly resonant’ as it came on United Nations Human Rights Day. ‘This historic step will mean that, for the first time, every gay person in England and Wales will finally enjoy exactly the same rights as their heterosexual friends and family,’ said Mr Summerskill. In a message to same-sex couples making preparations to walk down the aisle together, he added: ‘Don't forget, if you are thinking of booking a date for your big day in the new year, it's now against the law for any business to treat someone less fairly because of their sexual orientation - whether they're a register office, a hotel or a florist.

A set of murals whose removal prompted one of Britain's most noble fathers to boycott his son's wedding is returning to the family's magnificent stately home. Lord Bath, 81, was incensed when the Heaven and Hell murals he painted were removed from Longleat, Wiltshire, after his son Ceawlin took over the running of the ancestral pile - which includes 900 acres of grounds and a safari park. Now the flamboyant artworks will be reinstated - in a corridor one storey above their former home. Feud: The Marquess of Bath, 81, with one of the Heaven and Hell murals removed from his ancestral stately home of Longleat, Wiltshire. The row prompted him to boycott his son's wedding, the told the Mail on Sunday . Anger: Lord Bath and his son, whose title is Viscount Weymouth, in happier times at Longleat Safari Park . Mural: One example from what became known as the 'Heaven and Hell corridor' in the stately home . Ceawlin, whose title is Viscount Weymouth, sparked an apparent family feud earlier this year when his father's hand-painted murals disappeared from Longleat. The painter did not attend his son's wedding at the Elizabethan stately home, telling the Mail on Sunday: ‘I only found out once the removal had . started. It’s my life’s work and he’s quietly binned it. Lord Bath's daughter-in-law Emma McQuiston, pictured, insisted the whole row was caused by a mix-up . 'It’s killed my relationship with him and I don’t feel inclined to pay . any interest in his wedding.’ Instead of attending his son's wedding, Lord Bath and his wife pointedly went to the wedding of a . family friend in Hampshire. But his son's new wife was devastated, saying it was a misunderstanding and the murals were simply in storage. Emma McQuiston, a TV chef who became the first black viscountess when she married Ceawlin this summer, said: 'I can assure you that none of the murals that were previously in place in our apartment have been “binned”. 'The ones Ceawlin has moved have been very carefully preserved.' Longleat is one of the finest examples of Tudor architecture in England and has been in Lord Bath's family for 473 years. Bought by Sir John Thynne for £53 in 1540, the original house burned down a few years later but had been mostly rebuilt by 1580 and is now open to the public. It is home to one of the largest private book collections in Europe and the Great Hall contains the bloodied silk-sleeved waistcoat which was worn by Charles I at his execution in 1649. A planning application lodged with Wiltshire Council confirmed the murals will be re-hung in the south corridor on the second floor. The new home for the artwork is one storey higher than its original home, which became known as 'Heaven & Hell passage'. A spokesman for Benjamin & Beauchamp, a Somerset architect firm, said: 'The Heaven and Hell murals are currently held in store. 'Following careful checking of room sizes, it was confirmed the artwork would fit largely unaltered, within the second floor south passage. Magnificent: Longleat was built in the mid-1500s and is one of the best examples of Elizabethan architecture . Artist: Lord Bath, whose full name is Alexander George Thynn, painted several murals in the house himself . 'The height of the ceiling means the central inscription, a simple text on a plain board, will need to be smaller. 'The artwork has been aligned to fit along the length of the existing passage without interfering with fire doors. 'However, . the current door positions in the murals will need to be closed off, . and new openings formed, corresponding to the existing passageway door . locations, serving the rooms beyond.

Karissa Gates died on December 4 following a five-month battle with cancer, and now her family has discovered a Facebook page claiming to be collecting funds for her funeral but they had never been contacted with the page's creator. The girl who made the memorial page that solicited donations has not been named publicly, but she claims that she is a friend of a friend of Karissa's. The girl denied any wrong doing, but since she was contacted by both Karissa's godfather and a local news station, she has changed her story multiple times. Originally, the Facebook page said that it would collect money- cash or checks- that would either be donated to Radys Children's Hospital in San Diego where Karissa was treated or they would go to the funeral home though it did not specify the name of the home. 'I don't know the that family very well but I knew Karissa that’s why I decided to do this on my own as a fundraier... it the family wants to make a fundraiser that is up to them,' read a typo-riddled message posted by the creator on the page. 'It was more of a friend to friend thing trying to raise money and awareness, thats why all the money will go twds [sic] her funeral as well as childrens hospital so I don't want it written out to the family just so I know exactly where the money goes.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Confused: Karissa's mother Tima Gates said that she does not know the person who made a memorial Facebook page for her daughter and is concerned that she is soliciting money using her daughter's name . Karissa's godfather, Frances Gebo, told 10News that he contacted the page's creator by phone and was not happy with the insufficient answers he was given. 'I said ""who are you going to make the payment to?"" She said the funeral home and I said ""Well, which funeral home?"" And she said ""well, well"" and didn't have an answer and I said ""You know what? This doesn't seem right,""' Mr Gebo said. The station then contacted the girl herself and she maintained that her intentions were heart-felt. 'I'm not just gonna hand the money over to her mother. I don't know how her family is or what they will use it for! Ok!' the girl wrote in Facebook messages with the 10News reporter. 'This is really hurtful and degrading to be put down as if I'm doing something bad. All the money will be donated in memory of Karissa to Children's Hospital.' Unanswered questions: The girl who created the Facebook page, who has not been publicly named, claims that she was friends with Karissa and is now holding a toy drive in her honor . Suspicious: Karissa's godfather Frances Gebo called the girl behind the Facebook post and said she had no explanation for where the money would go and did not know the name of the funeral home . The girl has since changed the venue again, collecting toys and cash at a local hair salon allegedly in Karissa's honor. Karissa's mother remains sketeptical, saying that it appears odd that the girl would have felt to motivated to start her own fundraiser but then not even try contacting the relatives to give condolences. 'If you are going to go to that extent, then you would go to that extent to contact the family,' Tima Gates told 10News. Now the Gates family has started their own fundraising effort- having not had any further contact with the girl or seen any of the money that she was trying to raise- in order to have enough money to give the teenager a proper burial.

President Obama personally apologized on Thursday to the millions of Americans who have lost their individual health insurance plans as a consequence of the Affordable Care Act becoming law. 'I am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me,' the president said. 'We’ve got to work hard to make sure that they know we hear them, and that we’re going to do everything we can to deal with folks who find themselves in a tough position as a consequence of this.' Obama's surprising mea culpa came during a wide-ranging interview with NBC News. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . President Obama personally apologized Thursday to Americans who have lost their health insurance after he promised more than two dozen times that it would never happen . Millions of Americans have lost their individual health insurance plans since the Affordable Care Act became law, and a website called mycancellation.com is publishing the bad-news letters . He promised Americans more than two dozen times during and after his two presidential campaigns that 'if you like your health plan, you will be able to keep your health plan' under his landmark health insurance overhaul. 'First of all, I meant what I said,' he insisted during Thursday's interview with NBC reporter Chuck Todd, 'and we worked hard to try to make sure that we implemented that properly . 'But obviously we didn't do a good enough job. And I regret that.' Obama ultimately dissembled, though, blaming Americans' anger and late-night comedians' jokes on a lack of clarity – not on a politically expedient lie. 'I regret very much that what we intended . to do – which is to make sure that everybody is moving into better plans . because they want 'em, as opposed to because they're forced into it – that, you know, we weren't as clear as we needed to be.' 'Hey B! You lied,' wrote one North Carolina cancellation victim. He said BlueCross was the only participant in his health care marketplace, resulting in a plan costing $4,000 more per year with a higher deductible . Cancellation letters have hit an estimated 2.5 million Americans, and some analysts predict a total near 12 million by year's end . The president also repeated an explanation that his spokespersons have articulated often in recent weeks: that only '5 per cent of the population, in what's called the individual market' were affected by the rash of cancellations that some analysts predict will top 12 million. The Denver Post reported Thursday that 250,000 people in Colorado alone are in that group. 'A lot of these plans' that they're losing, Obama claimed for the third time in two weeks, 'are sub-par plans.' He seemed to acknowledge for the first time, however, that some Americans were content with those insurance policies. 'Folks since then have bought subpar plans' on their own, Obama conceded. 'And now that may be all they can afford.' He also claimed that many people with cancelled policies will find better and cheaper options in the government-run exchanges than they did before the federal government began to control the market. 'The majority of folks will end up being better off,' Obama said. 'Of course, because the website's not working right, they don't necessarily know it, right?","Obama promised more than two dozen times that 'if you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan' under Obamacare .

A professor has teamed up with digital artists to create striking pictures of how Roman Britain would have looked 2,000 years ago. The CGI images include a Roman ‘motorway’ stretching from Exeter to London, a forgotten port and luxurious-looking barracks for the occupying forces. Another image of the Roman town of Calleva Atrebatum, located in Hampshire, has been produced that paints a picture of a wealthy and bustling settlement. This CGI image shows the bustling Roman town of Calleva Atrebatum, which was near Silchester in Hampshire. It used to be a wealthy town with public baths, an amphitheatre and temples, but failed to develop into a modern city like Chichester and London . The images have been produced to give historians a clear understanding about what settlements in Roman Britain looked like at their peak and how the invasion affected British architecture and culture. They form part of a new series on historical TV channel, Yesterday, which aims to bring Britain's lost Roman Civilisations to life. Dr Michael Scott, an assistant professor of Ancient History at Warwick University, used his expert knowledge to inform the creation of the images and show how Britain would have looked during Roman occupation. An image of a 160-mile road from Exeter to London, which was a 15 feet high and 85 feet wide, allowed vast numbers of Roman soldiers to march to and from London. The road is believed to have been built 15ft above ground level to 'show off' the power of the Roman Empire to the conquered Brits. The original road, which is one of the country's major Roman roads, was uncovered in 2011 after being found in Puddletown Forest in Dorset.

A Roman fort in the area was excavated in 2009 by a team of archaeologists as part of a £318million Highways Agency scheme to upgrade the A1 between Dishforth and Leeming in North Yorkshire. The fort and its surroundings were a hive of light industry, including a water-powered flour mill used to grind grain and produce food for the soldiers and is believed to have been extremely important, supplying those travelling north on the Roman road that the A1 eventually replaced. Dr Scott said: ‘The sites I examined for this project are fascinating locations for different reasons. ‘Some because they were small cogs in the machine that was Roman Britain and others because they were the very arteries and muscles that made Roman Britain possible. ‘It is thanks to the different devoted teams of archaeologists that have worked - and continue to work - on these sites that they have not been lost to history forever.’ Healam Bridge in Yorkshire was a garrison base and the centre of Roman industry.

The CIA is paying AT&T more than $10million a year to provide phone records for overseas counter-terrorism investigations adding another agency to the list of government offices tapping into citizen's phone logs. The New York Times quoted government officials confirming that the second-biggest American mobile service provider is cooperating under a voluntary contract. That means that this partnership is a financial one, and AT&T is not under subpoenas or court orders compelling the company to participate. Paying customers: The CIA pays AT&T $10million to hand over information about potential terrorists, and the financial deal proves that the partnership between the phone company and the agency is not forced . AT&T did not confirm or deny the report but said payments from governments were routine for lawful data. The report comes amid widespread political uproar after former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden leaked documents describing how the U.S. government collects far more internet and telephone data than previously known. Under the AT&T arrangement, the CIA supplies phone numbers of overseas terrorism suspects and AT&T searches its database to provide call records that may help identify foreign associates, the paper said. Most of the call logs provided by AT&T involve foreign-to-foreign calls, the paper said. AT&T does not disclose the identity of the Americans calling from the United States, and masks their phone numbers when it produces the records, the paper said, quoting the officials. That does little to block the CIA from finding out the Americans involved, however, as it just means that they have to jump through some bureaucratic hoops first. Another agency: Previous phone tapping revelations concerned the NSA, and now this proves that the CIA (pictured) is involved in very similar operations with the help of the FBI . The CIA is tasked with handling security threats abroad and does not have the rights to obtain certain information about domestic citizens- which is left for the FBI. To get the information that AT&T obstructs, The Times says that the CIA asks the FBI to order an administrative subpoena to AT&T, forcing the company to hand over the personal data of the phone number in question. The FBI then shares that information with the CIA. AT&T said all government data requests were handled in a lawful and proper manner. 'We ensure that we maintain customer information in compliance with the laws of the United States and other countries where information may be maintained,' AT&T spokesman Mark Siegel said in an emailed statement. 'Like all telecom providers, we routinely charge governments for producing the information provided.'","New reports shows AT&T profited from turning records over .

The entire street was sealed off and police and fire crews were called out after a giant container truck containing the new governor’s belongings smashed into the tree. Mark Carnage! The tree is dealt with after the container truck did its damage . Neighbourhood watch: Mr Carney meets one of the residents of the London street where people have complained about the £1,300 suspension of six parking bays to make way for removal vans .

Mr Carney had already angered residents by arranging for the suspension of as many as six parking bays in the  street – at a total cost of £1,300 – to make way for his convoy  of removal vehicles. Some residents were unable to even get into their driveways because of the trucks. Neighbour Vivianne Avidan said: ‘I am surprised the council allowed so many bays to be taken out for so long. Maybe it is diplomatic, special privileges.’ Earlier this year, Mrs Carney suggested on Twitter that the couple were struggling to find a London home they could afford – despite her husband’s £874,000 salary which includes a £5,000 a month housing allowance. The couple have rented the property. A spokesman for the local council said:  ‘We left the tree in a safe condition.

Basteyns had been suspended for two days without pay, along with assistant coach Harold Seeley and a teacher after a civil rights groups complained about their costume, according to Fox 5. The coaches had blacked up and wore Jamaican bobsled outfits in a picture that was posted to Basteyns' Facebook page. Harris, who went on to compete in the 1992 and 1998 Winter Olympics, said he and two of his fellow teammates had not been offended, and complained that people were 'hyper sensitive' when it came to racism. He added: 'People are simply hyper sensitive when it comes down to race and racism ... every time we brush up on anything race or ethnic, people just go off the deep end.' Coach Basteyns confirmed he had spoken to Harris but declined to speak further about it. The image was posted on Bastenys’ Facebook page over the weekend, but has since been removed.

A Nike salesman has been sacked from the company's flagship London store for trying to sell his own second hand, company-issue trainers online. Daniel Jones, 23, posted a message on Facebook when his mother asked him to clear out his bedroom wardrobe, advertising five pairs of Nike shoes. He had accumulated the trainers during three-and-a-half years working at Nike's Oxford Street store. Sacked: Salesman Daniel Jones lost his job at Niketown for trying to sell five of his own trainers on Facebook . Mr Jones had bought two of the pairs himself at full price and two at a discount and had been given the fifth pair for free. He said would have accepted around £200 for all five and insisted he was only trying to earn a bit of money and not deliberately cash in on his job. But within days of his message appearing on his Facebook page he was hauled in by bosses and accused of gross misconduct. Mr Jones was suspended on the spot from his part-time £8,000-a-year job and sent home to Essex to await his fate. He then got a letter from the company telling him he had been sacked. He said: 'All I was doing was clearing out my wardrobe because my parents were going on about it. 'I thought I'll just stick the trainers on Facebook along with a lot of other clutter to see if anyone of my close friend wanted to buy them. Star salesman: Mr Jones stressed he has an exemplary record and claims he was fired without any warning .

'Most of them are several years' old but Nike accused me of trying to make a profit out of their business. 'They told me I wasn't allowed to advertise their stuff but I was only having a clear-out like anyone else.' Mr Jones was granted an appeal hearing against his sacking but Nike refused to change their mind. He added: 'They told me it didn't matter if I'd made a penny or a thousand pounds out of the sale - it was still a breach of company policy. 'I cooperated with them and removed all existence of my posts to friends on Facebook as soon as I was made aware of my mistake, but yet they still sacked me. Misconduct: The 23-year-old was hauled in by his bosses within days of the shoes appearing on Facebook . Second hand: Two pairs of the trainers Mr Jones was trying to sell were bought at full price . 'The fact I still had the intention to sell means I breached their rule book. The whole nonsense has been so distressing, I've had trouble sleeping. 'It wasn't premeditated and I was one of their best salesmen with an exemplary record, yet I'm kicked out without any warning.' He has now contacted a solicitor and ACAS and is considering further action for unfair dismissal. A Nike spokesman said: 'This employee was dismissed from Niketown London on the grounds of gross misconduct. 'The .

Dayna Morales, 22, was let go from her job at Gallop Asian Bistro in Bridgewater, New Jersey, nearly a month after she made national headlines over what’s likely a hoax. It comes just a few days after MailOnline exclusively revealed she had started paying back well-wishers who donated thousands of dollars to her. Fired: Dayna Morales, 22, was let go from her job at Gallop Asian Bistro in Bridgewater, New Jersey, nearly a month after she made national headlines over what’s likely a hoax. Morales has begun refunding well-wishers who . donated around $3,000 to her after hearing her outrageous tale . Pink slip: Gallop Asian Bistro in Bridgewater, New Jersey, issued a statement on Facebook to announce they had fired Danya Morales after the alleged hoax . The restaurant announced her termination on Facebook Saturday shortly after it was revealed she was returning donations from supporters across the world, according to the NY Post. ‘In light of … recent events, both Ms. Morales and Gallop Asian Bistro have made a joint decision that Ms. Morales will no longer continue her employment at our restaurant,’ the eatery wrote. “We wish her well in the future.' The waitress had apparently doctored the receipt to make it look like they hadn't tipped her. The receipt allegedly said: ‘I’m sorry but I cannot tip because I don’t agree with your lifestyle and how you live your life.’ But . the former marine's story fell apart just days later when the couple . came forward with their copy of the receipt showing an $18 tip. Proof? The controversial receipt (left) shows exactly the same price, time and date of the meal as the family's copy (right) - but does not have the $18 tip the family swear they left bringing the total to $111.55 . Gallop . Asian Bistro’s Facebook post said it had ‘taken seriously the . allegations made by Ms. Dayna Morales, and those made against her. ‘This is not a simple, straight-forward matter and we have conducted our own internal investigation. The . results of that investigation are inconclusive as to exactly what . happened between Ms. Morales and the customers that night.’ Former friends of hers have claimed . she was a compulsive liar who had pretended she had terminal cancer and . even that her father had raped her and killed her baby by throwing it . down the stairs. She . even said she was the sole survivor of a bomb blast in Afghanistan. But . it then transpired she had never seen action overseas and in fact had . been dishonorably discharged. Upset: Dayna Morales, pictured left while a . marine and right, said she was offended and hurt by how the couple, with . two small children, treated her while she served them but the family denied her claims . That was not before many who had been moved by her tale of prejudice stepped forward to donate money to her, which Morales had previously said she would give to LGBT charities and Wounded Warriors, a charity founded to help injured servicemen. People started coming forward earlier this week to reveal she has in fact apparently seen the error of her ways and started to return the cash. Some estimates of her total haul were around $3,000. It is not known if she has refunded the entirety of the cash. Ann Farnum-Messano posted on Have A Gay Day's Facebook page - the same organization that advocates for tolerance that Morales used to first broadcast her tale of woe. She said: 'I just got a refund from Dayna Morales. I hope she gets some help.' Disappointed: Well-wishers are happy that they have been refunded but also upset that the story was a 'hoax' Another woman, Vivian S. Bedoya, posted that she too 'received a PayPal refund' and felt she had been taken for a terrible ride by the duping server. Michael Knote, founder of Ohio-based Have A Gay Day told MailOnline that he was disheartened but Dayna Morales' lowball tactics. 'I feel let down,' he said. 'That someone would have the ability to just lie like this. 'I'm in a little disbelief that she didn't donate to the Wounded Warrior project, but I'm happy people are getting their money back.' But for some of the people who came in-person to leave cash--the fate of that money remains in question. ‘Some people dropped by cash,’ Gallop Asian Bistro co-owner said. ‘They come here and dropped a lot of money,’ Jack said. ‘I saw at least three or four people come here to give her cash and they will never come back.'","Dayna Morales, 22, was fired from her job at Gallop Asian Bistro in Bridgewater, New Jersey .

In their letter to President Obama and Congress, the firms said: ‘We understand that governments have a duty to protect their citizens. But this summer’s revelations highlighted the urgent need to reform government surveillance practices worldwide.’ The rare show of unity by usually fierce competitors is seen as a reflection of the damage in public confidence inflicted by leaks from the former NSA contractor-turned-whistleblower Snowden. Earlier this year he revealed how U.S. and British spy agencies were able to harvest huge amounts of data - including emails and search history - on millions of people by tapping into internet servers. In the open letter to President Barack Obama and Congress, the company chiefs said states had trampled on constitutional rights with the wholesale trawling of citizens' internet information. They demanded better oversight of government surveillance operations and new legal limits on how states can obtain sensitive, private information. It read: 'The balance in many countries has tipped too far in favor of the state and away from the rights of the individual - rights that are enshrined in our Constitution. This undermines the freedoms we all cherish. It's time for change. 'For our part, we are focused on keeping users' data secure, deploying the latest encryption technology to prevent unauthorized surveillance on our networks, and by pushing back on government requests to ensure that they are legal and reasonable in scope. Call for change: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg urged President Obama to lead the way on reforms to protect internet users' data from government surveillance . 'We urge the U.S. to take the lead and . make reforms that ensure that government surveillance efforts are . clearly restricted by law, proportionate to the risks, transparent and . subject to independent oversight.' The letter was also signed by Microsoft, . LinkedIn, Yahoo and AOL. But Google’s intervention will raise eyebrows, . given claims it deliberately harvested information from home computers . using its Street View cars. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, said . there was 'real need for greater disclosure and new limits on how . governments collect information'. Larry Page, Google's CEO, said 'the . apparent wholesale collection of data, in secret and without independent . oversight, by many governments around the world' had undermined users' confidence in his company's ability to safely secure their private . information. The concerted effort by the big eight internet firms, which together are thought to be worth more than $1.4tn, will ratchet up pressure on governments to act. It has been estimates that the damage to the industry from spying allegations could hit $180bn by 2016, according to Forrester Research. Executive vice president and general counsel of Microsoft, Brad Smith told Radio 4's Today programme this morning, called for more transparency over government surveillance efforts. He said: ‘I think there's a high likelihood that more companies will sign on and support these principles in the weeks ahead. 'We want to live in a world where security is balanced with personal freedom and privacy. 'For . many years governments have managed this responsibility [investigating . criminal activity online] for specific individuals and groups. 'It's very different to collecting information about everyone in case if becomes of interest at a later date. 'I . believe that people in our industry have long been under the impression . that government access to data was being governed by the law and due . process. It was only a month ago [after a Washington Post expose] that . we learned that more was going on than we were aware of.' 'Clearly . we want government to retain what they need to do in the proper way to . keep us all safe but there's an ample need to strengthen and increase . transparency.' Damage: Google CEO Larry Page, pictured, said internet users' confidence was seriously undermined by the 'wholesale collection of data, in secret and without independent oversight, by many governments around the world' Kent Walker, executive vice president and general counsel of Google, added: 'Strong encryption will go a long way towards ensuring the security and integrity of user data. 'We want to make sure policy makers and the public know what's at stake if we don't get this right.' The open letter by the big internet firms has been met with scepticism by some on Twitter. One user tweeted: 'Come on, after they get caught helping the NSA, too little too late....' While another questioned their credibility, asking: 'Are the tech companies sincere? Should citizens trust them after all they have done against freedom?' Some twitter users wondered if profit not concerns over user privacy had motivated this open letter. Governments are now facing a groundswell of opinion calling for reforms and limits to surveillance. Trevor Timm, an activist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told the New York Times the strength of public outrage over government prying into their private data was now too big an issue to ignore for the internet companies. He said: 'It’s now in their business and economic interest to protect their users’ privacy and to aggressively push for changes. 'The N.S.A. mass-surveillance programs exist for a simple reason: cooperation with the tech and telecom companies. If the tech companies no longer want to cooperate, they have a lot of leverage to force significant reform.' Nick Pickles, director of Big Brother Watch a group which campaigns for civil liberties, said: 'There can be no doubt that the surveillance laws of Britain, the U.S. or countless other countries around the world are not fit for an internet age. Britain’s own laws were written before many of these companies even existed. 'Governments should not need to be told by private businesses that it is wrong to collect data on every citizen, through secret processes subject to little or no oversight. 'Sadly that is the position we find ourselves in. This statement of principles, by some of the world’s biggest companies, is a watershed moment and one that cannot go ignored in any country that regards itself as a democracy. 'These businesses represent trillions of dollars of global revenue, highlighting the significant risk to the digital economy of those nations who do not take concerns about web surveillance seriously.' Last month, former U.S. intelligence contractor Snowden, 30, who fled to Russia where he is fighting extradition to the US on espionage charges, also called for surveillance program reforms. In a letter published in Der Spiegel, he wrote: 'The world has learned a lot in a short amount of time about irresponsibly operated security agencies and, at times, criminal surveillance programs. Sometimes the agencies try to avoid controls. 'While the NSA and GCHQ (the British national security agency) appear to be the worst offenders - at least according to the documents that are currently public - we cannot forget that mass surveillance is a global problem and needs a global solution. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO, Facebook: 'Reports about government surveillance have shown there is a real need for greater disclosure and new limits on how governments collect information. The U.S. Government should take this opportunity to lead this reform effort and make things right.' Larry Page, CEO, Google: 'The security of users' data is critical, which is why we've invested so much in encryption and fight for transparency around government requests for information. This is undermined by the apparent wholesale collection of data, in secret and without independent oversight, by many governments around the world. It's time for reform and we urge the U.S. government to lead the way.' Erika Rottenberg, General Counsel, LinkedIn: 'These principles embody Linkedin's fundamental commitment to transparency and ensuring appropriate government practices that are respectful of our members' expectations.' Brad Smith, General Counsel and Executive Vice President, Legal and Corporate Affairs, Microsoft: 'People won't use technology they don't trust. Governments have put this trust at risk, and governments need to help restore it.' Dick Costolo, CEO, Twitter: 'Twitter is committed to defending and protecting the voice of our users. Unchecked, undisclosed government surveillance inhibits the free flow of information and restricts their voice. The principles we advance today would reform the current system to appropriately balance the needs of security and privacy while safeguarding the essential human right of free expression.' Marissa Mayer, CEO, Yahoo: 'Protecting the privacy of our users is incredibly important to Yahoo. Recent revelations about government surveillance activities have shaken the trust of our users, and it is time for the United States government to act to restore the confidence of citizens around the world. Today we join our colleagues in the tech industry calling on the United States Congress to change surveillance laws in order to ensure transparency and accountability for government actions.'

When Lynda Whitehead introduced her new puppy Patch to her family, she didn’t realise quite how much of a führer he would cause. For while the cute seven-week-old is quiet and cuddly, her daughter spotted his uncanny resemblance to Adolf Hitler. Now he inspires her grandsons to do the goose-step and even responds to being called Adolf or Hitler. Spitting image: Hitler (left) and Patch the puppy (right), who has an unfortunate resemblance to the 20th Century dictator, but has a much gentler temperament . A dark mark on his top lip mirrors the Fuhrer's famous moustache. And another large brown area over his left ear completes the look of the 20th Century dictator. But, according to his owner, the resemblance ends there as Patch - unlike Hitler - has a lovable temperament. The tiny puppy, a cross between French bulldog and a shih tzu, has two brothers and lives with owner Lynda in York. She said no-one calls him by his real name any more and Patch is starting to obey orders - as 'Adolf' or 'Hitler'. Mrs Whitehead said: 'None of us noticed the likeness until we put a photo on Facebook and my eldest daughter saw it and said ‘You've got a little Hitler there"". 'Although he's called Patch, everybody calls him Adolf now. My grandsons are the worst for doing the goosestep when the puppy's around.'

They are a staple on restaurant tables across the country, but the EU has decided to ban olive oil jugs in order to ‘protect customers’. The controversial move means that customers will now only be able dip their bread or garnish their food using oil from non-refillable and labelled bottles. A decision to ban the classic jugs and dipping bowls was made by a little-known Brussels committee earlier this week. Outlawed: From January 2014 restaurants will have to serve oil from pre-packaged factory bottles with tamper-proof nozzles and labelling in line with EU industrial standards . They will be outlawed across Europe from the start of next year, with restaurants ordered to use oil from pre-packaged factory bottles complete with tamperproof lids. But restaurateurs have criticised the authoritarian measure taken by the European Commission – the EU’s executive. The body said it no plans to impose similar restrictions on packaging for butter, salt, pepper and other dinner table essentials. The Commission said that a majority of the EU’s member states had backed the move, which has already been compulsory in Portugal since 2006, and will benefit producers in struggling nations such as Spain and Greece. Traditional: Prince Charles trying unmarked olive oil from a dipping bowl, a practice which will soon be banned . The move was justified to improve hygiene and improve the ‘image of olive oil’, with the EU suggesting that many customers are often tricked by cheaper alternatives to olive oil. EU spokesman Olivier Bailly said: ‘We are just protecting consumers. We are just making clear that when you want to have olive oil of a certain quality in a restaurant you get exactly the one you are paying for.’ Another official said: ‘This is to guarantee the quality and authenticity of the olive oil put at the disposal of consumers. The aim is to better inform and protect consumer. We also expect hygiene to be improved too. Fraud: EU lawmakers fear that oil from unmarked bottles is undermining high quality, authentic olive oil . ‘Customers aren’t stupid - they would be the first to know if someone was being dishonest.’ Up to 70 per cent of the world’s olive oil is produced in the European Union but officials also fear that the product is the subject of widespread fraud. Cheaper produce is often passed as off as higher quality oil from some of Europe’s most renowned growing regions. British officials abstained from the vote, made using Common Agriculture Policy regulations, on Tuesday. The move to ban the jugs and serving dishes will be enforced by local authority food inspections of restaurants in the UK. Sam Clark, chef and owner of London’s award-winning Moro, criticised the decision, saying: ‘This will affect us. It is about choice and freedom of choice. We buy our oil, which we have selected from a farm in Spain, to serve our customers.’ Speaking to The Daily Telegraph, MEP Martin Callanan said: ‘Is it April 1st? With the euro crisis, a collapse in confidence in the EU, and a faltering economy surely the commission has more important things to worry about than banning refillable olive oil bottles? ‘They should be seeking to reduce unnecessary packaging.’","Olive oil jugs and dipping bowls to be banned by European Commission .

Found: Connie McCallister, who has been missing since 2004, has made contact with her family . A Wisconsin woman found in Mexico nine years after she disappeared at the age of 16 claimed she was drugged and taken abroad against her will. Connie McCallister, now 26, was rescued after a church missionary told the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children that she had been spotted. The honor-roll student at Athens High School weighed just 98lb when she was found, and had been working as a field laborer in Mexico under a new name, after escaping two abusive relationships. Miss McCallister claimed she had contacted local police about five years ago for help but her family say they heard nothing from her until September 15 this year. Before than, the last contact Miss McCallister had with her family . was on August 15, 2004, when she called her sister to say her boyfriend . was refusing to let her leave. The then-teenager, who had recently moved to Wausau, had been dating a 22-year-old Mexican, who has not yet been identified. 'He told her everything that she needed to hear, and she got involved with him,' Judy Weise, who is raising funds to bring Miss McCallister and her three children, Olivia, Jennifer and Christina, back to the U.S. said. 'They went to a party in Milwaukee and [McCallister] called her sister and said ""He won't bring me back"", and that's the last anyone heard from her, until September 15,' she told the Journal Sentinel. She said the young woman, whose daughters are aged 3, 5 and 7, told family she was drugged and taken to a foreign country against her will in 2004. The Trinity Lutheran Church in Athens, which Miss McCallister had been involved in as a teenager, is now trying to raise money to bring her back. Ms Weise told Mail Online: 'We need $5,000 to bring her and her three kids back and to raise additional money for health issues that need to be addressed.' Memories: Connie, center, with her mother Cindy, back, brother Morris, left, and sister Jeannie . Family: Connie, left, with her siblings Jeannie and Morris. They had recently moved to Wausau when she disappeared . She added: 'Connie has only spoken with her aunt and brother on Skype. She is safe but she doesn't leave the house without her husband.' Ms Weise, who knew Miss McCallister before she disappeared, added: 'She is coming back to central Wisconsin with her three children and petitioning for her husband to join them.' Police said they first heard rumors . that the missing woman was in Mexico years back, but couldn't confirm it . until three months ago. 'We . have confirmed, through conversations on Skype, that this is really . Connie, and she did ask for help in getting home,' Wausau Police Captain . Greg Hagenbucher said. 'But she won't come back without her children.' He . did not immediately return a call from Mail Online on Wednesday about further details in the case or claims that Miss McCallister's former boyfriend is wanted on charges . of first-degree sexual assault involving an unrelated victim. 'I don't believe she has been out of Mexico since she got there in 2004,' Captain Hagenbucher told ABC 9. Miss McCallister escaped from her boyfriend but ended up in another abusive relationship with a man who fathered her first child. At one point he beat her so badly that she was taken to hospital, where someone helped her get a new identity, Ms Weise, who works for Trinity Lutheran Church in Athens, said. Florence Volzka, one of Miss McCallister's aunts, said that with no proof of her identity, and unable to speak Spanish, Miss McCallister struggled to contact her family. She worked in fields and later married and had two more children. Reunited: Connie, pictured with her siblings and uncle, could soon be back with her family . 'She’s excited and she’s cautious and she knows it’s going to be whole new world again and she’s afraid,' Ms Volzka said. 'There are a lot of adjustments.' The 56-year-old said she never gave up hope that her niece would be found, adding: 'I always thought she would find a way home. She is very close knit with the family.' Officials with the U.S. Consulate are working with Miss McCallister to gather the required documents and identification records necessary for her to return, Police Detective Kay Hansen said. Trinity Lutheran Church has set up a fund to help Miss McCallister return. 'It's very costly to get someone through . all of this process,' Ms Weise said. 'They need car seats, clothes and . bunk beds. Connie is dealing with health issues - she's only 98lb - . and needs medical care and three children need immunizations.' The woman's mother, Cindy, moved to Florida after her daughter disappeared but several other family members still live in Wausau.","Connie McCallister was found by church missionary three months ago .

The airline claims to have spent the past four months putting together its Christmas Miracle stunt, in which passengers got to tell Santa Claus what they want before catching their flight and hey presto it was there waiting for them at the other end of their journey. The video was uploaded onto YouTube on Sunday and depending on your seasonal cheer levels, it is either a heart-warming reminder of what Christmas is all about or a shameless attempt by an airline to milk the holidays for all they can in a shamelessly icky promo stunt. Scroll down for video . Passengers flying with Canadian low-cost carrier WestJet got an early Christmas surprise when they got to ask Santa for gifts as they boarded and then collected the presents at their destination .

Air travel during the holidays is typically a nightmare of cancelled flights and lounges overflowing with harassed passengers, but in WestJet’s alternative universe the whole experience looks a lot more relaxed and even fun. Passengers flying to Calgary from Toronto and Hamilton were filmed asking a virtual Santa Claus what they wanted for Christmas while still in the departure lounge. The video shows a variety of passengers – young and old – take it in turns to tell Father Christmas about the gift they most what before boarding their flights.

While the passengers enjoy their apparently relaxing flights, the WestJet elves are busy getting the presents to the airport, wrapping them up and ensuring that each package has the name of the person who asked Santa for it. After the passengers finally touch down in Calgary we see them milling around baggage reclaim, which has been decorated to look as seasonal as possible with giant gingerbread men and even fake snow. Then the baggage carousel starts up and rather than their luggage, the passengers are greeted with individual gift boxes containing their specially-requested Christmas gifts.

'This year, we wanted to turn our holiday campaign into a tradition by doing something that's never been done before,' explained WestJet spokesperson Richard Bartrem. 'Inspired by the notion of real-time giving, we wanted to surprise our guests with meaningful, personalized gifts when they least expected them.

A city has been forced to scrap its controversial 'Moroccan bazaar' Christmas market after immigration chiefs refused to let the north African traders into the country. Residents in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, had already voiced their anger that 'Kasbah' stalls from the 99 per cent Muslim country would not fit with the spirit of Christmas. And there were more complaints on Thursday when a caravan of Moroccan camels missed the city's 'switch-on' event because the vehicle carrying them got stuck behind an accident on the M6. Now the three-week market has been cancelled altogether, Stoke-on-Trent City Council has admitted - with no time to arrange a replacement. Bazaar idea: Councillors in Stoke-on-Trent hoped their winter market would resemble Marrakesh, pictured . However, the reality was decidedly more British when Stoke (pictured) was told the traders were refused visas . The market was also due to travel to Leeds and Peterborough, Cambridgeshire. Labour-run Stoke-on-Trent City Council started talks with . the market's organisers in June, met them twice and received . documents, including insurance details and a list of traders, ahead of . their planned arrival last Tuesday. The first sign of trouble, however, came last week when the council was warned the traders would not arrive until Friday December 6. Organisers vowed it would still go ahead as soon as immigration officers cleared the 40 'artisan' traders for entry. But council officials now admit there were 'unforeseen problems' with the issuing of visas. Morocco (pictured) is 98 to 99 per cent Muslim and most residents do not celebrate Christmas . City Centre Partnership chairman Doug Wardle said: 'This is very disappointing all round. I was really looking forward to going.' Shopper Jane Richards, 34, added: 'A lot of people will have made plans to go to the market so they will be annoyed to find it's not on. 'Everyone has been making a really big deal about it so it's embarrassing for it to be cancelled.' Many residents, however, had been sceptical about whether the market would have succeeded. Labourer Dennis Havers, 55, said: 'It's a joke really. I'm sure my grandkids will love a camel ride but it is a bonkers idea. 'I like to go to these markets to feel Christmassy but I can't see how a Moroccan rug is going to make me think about Jesus or the nativity.' Stoke-on-Trent was not the only city affected. The market was also due to visit Leeds and Peterborough . Part-time secretary Sue Hildreth, 62, added: 'It is outrageous. We all know Morocco is a Muslim country so it maybe classed as ""festive"" I suppose but it won't be celebrating Christmas will it?' And Office worker Simon Tovey, 22, said: 'I couldn't believe it when I read about the market. At least the German markets feel wintry and festive.' Cllr Adrian Knapper, cabinet member for health and wellbeing, said: 'We're very disappointed they have told us the traders are not coming. 'If the market had traded we would have made a profit of around £2,000 but there has been no other expense to the council. 'We are not able to provide an alternative market but we still have two Thursday night late-night shopping events in the city centre which are packed full of family-friendly entertainment and will go-ahead as planned.' The market organisers were unavailable for comment yesterday.","Stoke-on-Trent residents were perplexed by market from Muslim country .
