"Hospitals need to take action against the spread of a deadly, antibiotic-resistant strain of bacteria, says the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The bacteria kill up to half of patients who are infected. The bacteria, called carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae or CRE, have increased over the past decade and grown resistant to even the most powerful antibiotics, according to the CDC. In the first half of 2012, 200 health care facilities treated patients infected with CRE. ""CRE are nightmare bacteria,"" CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden said in a statement. ""Our strongest antibiotics don't work and patients are left with potentially untreatable infections. Doctors, hospital leaders and public health must work together now to implement CDC's 'detect and protect' strategy and stop these infections from spreading."" That strategy includes making sure proper hand hygiene policies in health care facilities are actually followed. Patients should also be screened for CREs, according to the CDC. Infected patients should be isolated, or grouped together to limit exposures. Why 'nightmare bacteria' on the rise . The good news is that not only is CRE seen relatively infrequently in most U.S. facilities, but current surveillance systems haven't been able to find it commonly in otherwise healthy people in the community, says Dr. Alex Kallen, a CDC medical officer. ""Of course, if this were to (spread to the community), it would make it much more difficult to control,"" he said. Each year, hospital-acquired infections sicken about 1.7 million and kill 99,000 people in the United States. While up to 50% of patients with CRE bloodstream infections die, similar antibiotic-susceptible bacteria kill about 20% of bloodstream-infected patients.","Deadly bacteria are called carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae .

"I first saw the Costa Concordia glinting in the winter sun from 20,000 feet as my flight from London made a slow descent on its way to Rome's Fiumicino airport. It seemed a distant blade of light lying next to a speck of an island. A surge of gasps and chatter reverberated around the cabin as Italian passengers craned their necks to see it. As I later approached the island on a ferry, the ship again came into view almost as soon as the ferry left the mainland. As we closed in, the vast scale of the cruise ship became clear. It was like looking at an apartment block lying in the sea: a ship, yes, but everything about its orientation was wrong. She lay on her side, the hull obscenely exposed to our widening eyes. The ferry passed within a couple hundred feet as we entered the main port of Giglio Island and the huge chunk of rock, the size of a car, could clearly be seen embedded in her hull. Over the next two weeks, I spent a large part of every day staring at the wreck -- and yet still it surprised me. Each morning my crew and I would descend the vertiginous road from our hotel, round a sharp bend and there was this colossal ship on her side. From the top of the island, the Costa Concordia looked exactly like a bath-time toy, carelessly capsized by a child's hand. But this surreal tableau was etched in epic proportions. Now that the frantic first reports of what happened are behind us, CNN has built up a much more comprehensive view of what went wrong, thanks to documents, congressional testimony and interviews with dozens of experts, crew members, witnesses and passengers. Concordia disaster focuses attention on how cruise industry operates . Since the night the Concordia capsized January 13, CNN has continued to dig to figure out what happened aboard the ship and why. We spoke to officials with Costa Cruise Lines as well as Italian investigators examining the incident. We've also spoken with officials with the International Maritime Organization, the body that oversees cruise safety. From a broad perspective, CNN examined the cruise industry as a whole. What we found will be unsettling for anyone who has taken or is thinking of taking a cruise: allegations of inadequate safety briefings and chaos in the minutes after the collision; a captain who failed to sound a general alarm for almost an hour, meaning vital, lifesaving assemblies at lifeboat stations did not take place; and a crew that felt unable to act without clear orders from their captain. In some cases, lifeboats were not able to be launched because by the time the general alarm finally sounded at 10:48 p.m., the ship was leaning over too far to allow the lifeboats to launch. Thirty-two people died in the Concordia disaster. We learned that 6,000 tons of water entered the Concordia in just 20 minutes. For a ship three times the weight of the Titanic, it was fatal. Almost immediately, key equipment in the engine room was knocked out. The ship's backup generators were flooded. Computers that monitor the ship's stability were also compromised. CNN's documentary team obtained remarkable footage from the ship's bridge that revealed Captain Francesco Schettino grappling with a situation that was already out of control. His ship had a hole below the waterline the width of a football field. We also found compelling evidence that Schettino's decision to ""salute"" the island of Giglio by sailing perilously close caused the accident, but also that this wasn't the first time the Costa Concordia had sailed within a few hundred yards of the rocks. Schettino is still awaiting trial on multiple charges of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship. Schettino escaped the ship on a lifeboat while the ship was capsizing. A transcript of his tense exchange with Port Authority officials can be read here, including their order to him to ""Get on board, damn it!"" Perhaps the most chilling account of the night in CNN's documentary comes from a family on board - Californians Dean and Georgia Ananias and their daughters Valerie and Cindy. Their story, together with previously unseen footage of that night, gives a real sense of the terror of those trying to escape. The Ananiases were among the last to get off the Concordia alive. They are cruise veterans, having been on more than 60 voyages, but now they say they won't step foot on another ship until the industry changes. Some lessons have already being learned. Costa is introducing new rules about safety briefings, mandatory additional life jackets and, crucially, new equipment is being introduced to accurately track all of Costa's ships and notify headquarters if the captain decides to take a detour. I've never been on a cruise; I love the sea and I'm a keen sailor. But knowing all the concerns and questions about safety aboard cruise ships, I'd want answers before I took a cruise. I would feel more comfortable when the reforms that the International Maritime Organization are recommending are made mandatory.","Writer on seeing Concordia: It looked like an apartment block lying in the sea .

"Michael Bloomberg is investing a chunk of his personal fortune to minimize the influence of the National Rifle Association. The former New York City mayor pledged $50 million to his new group Everytown for Gun Safety, an umbrella organization for his two other gun control groups: Mayors Against Illegal Guns and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. It aims to make the political climate more supportive of gun control. The new organization plans to compete against the NRA by adopting its playbook. The NRA has built an impressive and effective organization that touts millions of members, a robust lobbying organization and a massive campaign arm. ""You've got to work at it piece by piece,"" Bloomberg told the The New York Times. In its grass-roots operation, Everytown plans to increase its membership from 1.5 million to 2.5 million this year to implement its education and mobilization efforts. The group will focus on 15 states that have liberal gun laws, including Texas, Montana and Indiana. States that have advanced gun control initiatives will also receive attention, including Colorado and Washington. Bloomberg says no, again, to 2016 . ""The NRA should be afraid,"" said Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action. Women, and more particularly mothers, will be the key demographic in the outreach to curb gun violence. ""Moms are afraid that our children will be taken away. In the end, that's the emotion that's going to win."" But influencing those in charge of writing gun policy will be the ultimate goal of the organization, which is also creating a political action committee to elect gun safety candidates to office and a 501(c)(4), an IRS classification used to raise unlimited amounts of money to influence voters. It aims to motivate a million pro-gun safety voters to go to the polls in November. In addition, like the NRA, the organization will submit a gun safety questionnaire to candidates and keep a score card of how elected officials vote on gun-related issues. ""If the candidate doesn't support gun reform, we won't support you,"" Watts said. With an infusion of cash from Bloomberg, matching the NRA's financial heft will be a little less daunting. The NRA has spent more than $30 million lobbying elected officials since 1998. Its efforts have been very successful in Congress over the past decade, defeating attempts to ban assault weapons and expand background checks. On the electioneering side of the influence game, the NRA's political action committee has spent nearly $150 million on campaigns since 1990. Already in the first two months of this midterm election year, the powerful gun group raised $14 million, according to public data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. President of Everytown, John Feinblatt, said the group's 34,000 donors will also play a critical role in rivaling the NRA. ""I don't want to lay blame anywhere, but it is a reality that the gun lobby has an incredible amount of political influence with members of Congress in Washington,"" Mark Kelly, a prominent gun control advocate, told CNN in December. Kelly's wife is former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was severely wounded in a shooting in Arizona in 2011. ""I mean, it's very clear that many members take their cues on this issue from the gun lobby,"" he said. The NRA has little to say about Bloomberg's pledge, for now. ""See you in Indianapolis next week. We'll have a lot more to say then,"" spokesman Andrew Arulanandam told CNN. He was referring to the group's annual conference, which takes place next week in Indianapolis. Bloomberg's activism for gun safety increased after repeated mass shootings. His efforts to expand background checks after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School failed to pass either the House or the Senate, despite pressure from the Obama administration. The organization wants to expand background checks, keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers, crack down on gun trafficking and educate parents about the safe storage of guns.","The gun control group will focus on electing gun safety advocates to office .

"It has been in operation only since October 30, but the Facebook page for ""Giving back to those affected by Sandy"" has a longer timeline than most Facebook members. The page, started by the group ""BK girls give back,"" began as a way to help people stranded in areas with no cell service or way to communicate after the superstorm. Soon, it took on a life of its own. Shelters in need of supplies, residents in need of a ride, organizations needing volunteers and even people who lost and found pets all posted on the timeline. ""The page was started for us to just keep track of our friends and family that needed help,"" said Christina Karaba, one of the ""BK girls"" and an employee of Turner Broadcasting, CNN's parent company. She says they've had 1.2 million hits. ""Giving back"" is just one of many pages, like ""Help Brooklyn,"" ""Sandy HELP,"" ""Surviving Sandy"" and ""Sandybaggers,"" where people looking to help victims of the storm come together to share information.  Indeed, Facebook says, after the storm, there were as many as 700 groups with ""Hurricane Sandy"" in the title. One page, ""Hurricane Sandy Acts of Kindness,"" lists posts from those looking to help victims and those looking to highlight acts of kindness toward the storm's victims. Stories fill the page, from someone paying the hair salon bill of a woman who'd lost everything in the storm to a family delivering food to those without power. Many have taken to Twitter to promote fundraising events. ""I'm buying all my holiday gifts this year at this amazing pop-up in NY benefitting #hurricanesandy victims,"" tweeted Gail Zinser. ""go shop!"" For the most part, Facebook communities looking to help storm victims don't solicit cash. Karaba says her team doesn't handle any money. She refers to them as ""help brokers."" ""You come to us when you need help and come to us when you want to help. ... We're making the help connections."" Where Twitter is often a vehicle for publicity, many people and businesses turned the tables, tweeting offers of help, including free legal advice, clothing drives and pet and child care. Although nonprofits are frequently focused on the big picture, social media communities are able to respond in real time to calls for help, no matter the nature. It's a bonus for those who either can't afford to or don't want to merely donate funds and trust they'll get where they're needed but want to reach out personally. The page ""Adopt a Family, Hurricane Sandy"" is working to help those whose homes were destroyed or who still lack power to find temporary accommodation with hosts. One update urged people to host older couples: ""Everyone wants the kids, but these people have worked their whole life in order to finally enjoy it and now DON""T HAVE INSURANCE to help rebuild."" A response from someone a day later: ""I'd be happy to help a hardworking adult who needs a bit of help getting on their feet."" Another page connected those who'd lost the use of their homes with others who were interested in hosting them for Thanksgiving dinner.  Now it's spawned a page for those who want to invite families for Christmas also. Twitter users also took to the site to urge people to take in families.  ""NYers can host a family displaced by #HurricaneSandy for Thanksgiving,"" tweeted Peter S. Greenberg. ""that's just 1 way to give back."" The potential of social media communities to help with unique situations is notable.  In many instances, they've simply provided a logistical platform for those who have lost something or need items or help. Many tweeted requests for supplies or manpower. The ""Hurricane Sandy's Lost Treasures"" page is devoted to helping reunite owners with found objects.  The site displays photos and letters found in various locations; the hope is they'll be reclaimed. There are also several pages specifically aimed to help those who have lost pets in the storm, such as ""Hurricane Sandy lost and found pets,"" which has more than 26,000 likes.  Under a photo of a squinting gray tabby being petted, one woman wrote, ""I will adopt him if you don't find the owners."" Much of the appeal of ""Helping Sandy"" social media groups is their ability to specialize. They run the gamut from the general to the very specific. ""Help The Babies Affected By Hurricane Sandy"" is collecting supplies for affected families in Long Island. The page thanks families from as far away as Washington state for donations of toys and clothing. There's even a page, created by The Knot, for brides whose weddings have been affected by Sandy. It features posts from people offering to donate dresses, create ""save the date'"" cards and provide their venues for the wedding, free of charge. Many success stories come from pages set up to help just one victim of the storm.  Kara Strafaci used the Facebook page ""Jersey Shore Hurricane News"" to get help for her grandmother, trapped in the Seaside Park area without her medication. Upon finding a lost dog in Breezy Point, Ann Lewis set up a page for the pup.  Maggie turned out to belong to a volunteer firefighter; she was lost while he was putting out fires in Breezy Point during the storm. Ann concluded the page with a photo of Maggie happily reunited with her family. It's in those stories that much of the appeal of helping through social media lies. Many, particularly in the New York area, want the chance not just to donate but to be there in person, helping communities get back on their feet. As Karaba says of ""BK girls give back,"" ""We're not a huge corporation. ... We're real people from Brooklyn who grew up here.  It's the places and people we grew up with.  There is a lot of stake for us.  We want to see our home recover; it's uber personal.""","Social media are helping volunteers connect with those in need in real time .

"To understand Jay Silver, it helps to go back 10 years, to a night he spent flying kites on a beach in his native Florida with the woman who would become his wife. She asked him whether he knew how to listen to the wind. Being an engineer, he responded that wind produces only white noise, and white noise contains no information. But he loved her, so he opened his mind and gave it a try. ""And I felt a deep joy,"" Silver said during a recent talk at the PopTech conference here. ""And then I stopped pursuing information and efficiency, and I changed my life's course a little and started to practice rituals of joy."" This childlike sense of play, curiosity and discovery -- one that many people lose as they move through adulthood -- has informed Silver's life and work ever since. It's no accident that he shows audiences video clips of wide-eyed toddlers encountering snow for the first time or an M&M candy skittering around on a moving escalator. Or that he took the stage at PopTech in a T-shirt, baggy shorts and a surfer cap, looking more like a skateboarder than someone with a Ph.D. from MIT. Yes, at 33, Silver is something of a big kid himself. He's also a leading proponent of the ""maker movement,"" the do-it-yourself culture of inventing, hacking and prototyping that inspires many young engineers in tech fields. At the MIT Media Lab, Silver studied how to make tools that engage people's creative spirit and help them make things with modern technology. One of his first creations was Drawdio, an electronic pencil that lets you make music as you draw. Next up was something with the Silveresque name of MaKey MaKey, an invention kit he developed at MIT with fellow student Eric Rosenbaum. Funded by Kickstarter (they set a goal of $25,000 and raised $568,000), the simple electronic kit contains a circuit board, alligator clips and USB cables and helps anyone turn everyday objects into touchpads that can be used to interact with a computer. People clamp the alligator clips to an object and then connect them through the kit to their computer. Touching the object produces a tiny electrical connection, which the computer interprets as a keystroke or the movement of a mouse. The kits cost $50 and say ""Be stoked. The world is your construction kit!"" on the box. Since they began shipping last summer, people around the world have used them to control computer programs with anything that can conduct electricity: fruit, plants, water, even household pets. One student at Southern Methodist University won a talent show by hooking MaKey MaKey to plates full of food and eating his way through a crowd-pleasing rendition of ""The Star-Spangled Banner."" MaKey MaKey seems like a toy, and educators have used it to play games or teach kids about basic electrical circuitry. But Silver believes that his kit can also help engineers test concepts and prototypes more cheaply. ""Some people are just totally goofing around (with the kits). Some people are making devices so that their son with cerebral palsy can access browsing the Web,"" he said. ""I don't know which of those two things actually are more important. They're both, to me, really valuable."" Silver, now a maker-research scientist at Intel Labs, hopes MaKey MaKey will awaken the creative impulse in people and encourage them to tackle their own DIY projects. ""Right now, in culture, there's this feeling that we have to make (things). And I think it's because we didn't make (things) for a while, with the Industrial Revolution,"" he said. ""I think when you make something, you're kind of making meaning and purpose. You're kind of making the world what it is. You're voting with your hands -- not in a booth but making change, right now, that really happens in your own space."" Lifelong Kindergarten . Long before that night on the beach, Silver's roiling imagination was inventing stuff. As a boy in Cocoa Beach, Florida, he duct-taped a fork to a hand drill to make an automatic spaghetti-twirling machine. In fourth grade, he discovered by accident that his walkie-talkies communicated at the same frequency as his remote-control car. So he combined the car, an upside-down trash can and some other parts to make a robot he controlled by making certain sounds into the walkie-talkies. ""Like any good child of the '80s, I watched a lot of 'MacGyver.' But I was pretty bad at making things,"" he said. ""I loved kites. Kites have more questions than answers. I love things with more questions than answers."" Silver is fascinated by the idea of combining or refashioning objects, like his spaghetti twirler, to create uses for which they were not intended. ""What is the purpose of things? Who said that was the purpose of it?"" he asked. ""Other people don't have to decide the meaning of things. We can all decide."" It's the same impulse that leads kids to play with a box instead of the toy that came in it. ""I didn't need anything special to hack as a child. I just used whatever was around. I think all children do this,"" Silver wrote in an e-mail. ""I think this is one of the most special and also least unique things about all humans: They try everything every way and have very open minds, especially when young."" At MIT, Silver became part of a group called Lifelong Kindergarten, which seeks to foster creative adults through a ""kindergarten style of learning"" that emphasizes designing, experimenting and exploring. It was a great fit for him because it taught him to not fear failing, to keep trying different things. ""I'm kind of a bottom-up maker. I don't have a plan. I don't really know how things work that well. I just mess around with stuff, and things start to emerge,"" he said. ""It's kind of like a conversation with materials."" Silver's approach -- part engineer, part artist, part curious 5-year-old -- impressed his mentors at MIT. ""Jay is an incredible creative force. Rarely have I met someone who spins out so many creative ideas. He really has the spirit of a tinkerer, always trying out new things,"" said Mitchel Resnick, professor of learning research at the MIT Media Lab. ""Jay has held on to that playful curiosity (that children have) and uses that to engage with people,"" Resnick added. ""One thing that's for sure is that Jay will do something that none of us will expect. He'll create new paths that none of us are even thinking about today. And whatever it is, it'll help people explore the world around them and bring joy to their lives."" Creative confidence . Today, Silver lives in Santa Cruz, California, with his wife, Jodi, an artist and early-childhood-creativity educator, and their son, Oak, 2. His job at Intel takes him to festivals and events such as the Bay Area Maker Faire, where he leads creative workshops on such activities as making digital circuits by drawing with a pencil. In return, he takes some of what he learns about prototyping back to Intel Labs, which does research in a variety of futuristic computing fields. Silver is also still spreading the word about MaKey MaKey. His production company, JoyLabz, has distributed about 20,000 of the kits. ""The reason I'm making this kit is that I'm totally stoked about what I can do with it and what other people can do with it,"" he said. ""I hope that other people use it in a way that makes them feel alive. And if they are, it doesn't matter to me if what they're doing can be called useful or not."" Silver talks wistfully about a utopian future where everyone creates their own unique space instead of settling for cookie-cutter homes or furnishings or decorations. ""We just don't want people running to Walmart when they have a wobbly table,"" he said. Instead, Silver envisions a new generation of creative thinkers who cut and paste disparate materials to make something new that holds personal meaning for them -- like what artists and writers have been doing for centuries but on a broader scale. ""Take, for example, one of the cornerstones of creative icons: LEGOs. LEGOs let you build anything, right? Well, I am a fan of LEGOs, but there is one thing they are not communicating: The world you live in is a set of LEGOs,"" he said. ""That's my message. You don't need a kit, and you don't need to stick to the pieces that come in the box."" To Silver, such tinkering boosts ""creative confidence"": the transformative power that comes with making something tangible and fresh. ""If you get some kids thinking 'I can do this' -- especially ones that wouldn't have had a chance to think that way -- that's good enough for me. And we're already seeing it happen,"" he said. Silver's workshops are aimed mostly at children, but there's a reason why he's invited to speak at idea-driven conferences like TEDx and PopTech. His lessons are applicable to any hidebound grad student or business executive: Rewrite the rules. Try everything. Don't be afraid to fail. Follow your joy. To Silver, it's human nature. ""The world that I'd like to live in is a world where everybody helps to make it in their own way,"" he said. ""So it's a hodgepodge of different collections, of contributions ... reflecting everyone's own internal inspiration. Kind of the way nature is, but with humans. That would be a beautiful world.""","Jay Silver is a leading proponent of ""maker movement,"" the do-it-yourself culture of inventing .

"She wouldn't build a prison. But the world's most famous female architect, Zaha Hadid, says she's willing to work in countries which have faced criticisms over their human rights records.

"Complications with the placement of an IV into a vein of death row inmate Clayton Lockett played a significant role in his botched execution, according to a report by the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety. Lockett was executed by the state of Oklahoma on April 29 in a lethal injection protocol that was beset with complications. An autopsy confirmed that Lockett died from the execution drugs and not from a heart attack, but many consider it botched nonetheless because it took 43 minutes for him to die. Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin ordered an investigation into the execution, which thrust the debate over capital punishment back into the spotlight. The report was released Thursday. Oklahoma Department of Corrections Director Robert Patton told Fallin that his agency will rewrite execution protocols, Fallin said. ""I continue to believe the death penalty is an appropriate and just punishment for those guilty of the most heinous crimes, as Mr. Lockett certainly was. The state's responsibility is to ensure a sentence of death is carried out in an effective manner,"" Fallin said. One factor that led to the complications was the difficulty the doctor and paramedics in the execution chamber had in placing the IV that would deliver the execution drugs into Lockett's veins. It took 51 minutes and attempts in different parts of his body before the doctor felt comfortable with the IV placed in Lockett's right groin area, the report said. For placement there, the doctor told investigators he would have preferred a longer needle, but the size he wanted was not available, so he used what was available. Because Lockett's groin area was exposed to place the IV, Warden Anita Trammell decided to cover up the exposed area with a blanket to protect the inmate's dignity, the report said. As a consequence, the place where the IV was inserted was covered and not visible to the doctor. It wasn't until the second and third drugs of the execution cocktail were being administered that the doctor saw something was wrong, the report said. ""Lockett began to move and make sounds on the execution table,"" the report states. ""It should be noted that the interview statements of the witnesses regarding Lockett's movements and sounds were inconsistent."" Lifting the blanket, those in the execution chamber observed clear liquid and blood on Lockett's skin near the groin area, and swelling under the skin that was ""smaller than a tennis ball but larger than a golf ball,"" the report states. If the doctor would have been able to see the point where the IV was inserted, the problem could have been identified sooner, according to the report. At that point, according to the report, the doctor was unsure how much of each drug made it into the vein, or whether it was enough to result in death. The doctor was unable to insert the IV in the other femoral artery. Another failure noted in the report was that even if another vein was used, there was not a backup supply of execution drugs if indeed an insufficient amount had been injected the first time. The report notes that as the team struggled with these complications, Lockett's heartbeat continued to lower. The execution was halted, but Lockett died anyway. The investigation found that there were some minor deviations from the required protocol during the execution, but that those did not contribute to the complications. ""This investigation concluded the viability of the IV access point was the single greatest factor that contributed to the difficulty in administering the execution drugs,"" the report states. Among the report's recommendations was to make the IV insertion point visible to the doctor at all times and to alert the governor's office if it takes more than one hour to insert the IV. The incident provoked sharp criticism from attorneys and lethal injection experts from the Death Penalty Clinic at the University of California Berkeley School of Law. ""The state's internal investigation raises more questions than it answers,"" said Dale Baich, an attorney representing Oklahoma death row prisoners. ""The report does not address accountability. It protects the chain of command. Once the execution was clearly going wrong, it should have been stopped, but it wasn't."" Megan McCracken of the Death Penalty Clinic called for an independent investigation. ""Multiple factors contributed to Mr. Lockett's badly bungled execution, including lacking of planning and training, a failure to set a functioning IV, and a failure to plan for contingencies.

"As Americans read about the flood of private money that is going into the current presidential campaign, most can't help but shake their heads in disgust about how our democracy functions. With all the talk about changing Washington, voters are shrewd enough to understand that if contributors give this much money to the candidates in both parties, there is little chance that Washington will be much different in 2013. In Depth: Where money and politics collide . Americans tend to be cynical that campaign finance reform will ever work.   The conventional assumption is that politicians will never be willing to fix the system and they will circumvent any laws that come their way. Trust in government continues to plummet. Yet we must remember that there have been moments when positive change happened. The most important episode in the history of campaign finance reform took place in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal that brought down President Richard Nixon. Although Watergate was about a break-in to Democratic campaign headquarters and the coverup that followed, the congressional investigations revealed the ways in which interest groups donated campaign funds with the hope of shaping policy and how politicians, including Nixon's advisers, circumvented existing laws. The scandal prompted Congress to finally tackle these bigger issues about campaigns. As then Sen. Joseph Biden explained, ""Watergate isn't the question. Watergate is merely a vehicle through which we can get through what we originally could not get through because the fellows on the other team are in a very compromising position as a consequence of it."" Congress passed legislation that established contribution and spending limits, public financing for presidential elections and an independent elections commission. During the next two decades, the system for funding presidential elections proved to be remarkably effective.  The system provided partial funds during the primaries and full funding during the general election. To receive the taxpayer funds, candidates had to agree to abide by restrictions on how much they could spend and how much they could receive from private sources. Candidates in both parties agreed to the system. Though it was far from perfect, the reforms had a big impact in reducing the power of private money. Former Democratic power broker Robert Strauss and former secretary of Defense and Republican congressman Melvin Laird concluded in 1986: ""Public financing of presidential elections has clearly proved its worth in opening up the process, reducing the influence of individuals and groups, and virtually ending corruption in presidential election finance."" This was not the only reform that made a difference. Disclosure laws enacted in the 1970s have produced a much more transparent process that allows voters and reporters to easily find out about where money is coming from and how much is being spent. The nation has come a far distance from the 1950s when there was virtually no data on the sources of campaign finance. Over time, the system for publicly financed presidential elections did break down. During the 1980s and 1990s, donors found loopholes to move money into the campaigns. As fewer Americans checked the box on their tax returns to donate their money to the system, the amount of funds available seemed meager compared to what candidates could raise on the fundraising circuit. The lure of massive campaign funds proved to be too great. In 2000, Republican candidate George W. Bush did not take public money so that he could free himself from any restrictions. In 2004, Democrats John Kerry and Howard Dean did not take public funds for their primary runs either. Four years later, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama did the same for the primaries, and Obama did so for the general election. Although efforts to stop funding the public campaign budget have failed, President Obama and whoever runs for the Republicans will continue the path set out in 2008. Public funds are now irrelevant. The constraints that came with those funds are gone, and overall limits on private campaign fundraising have been weakened by court decisions. It is time for the parties to look again at the system that Congress put in place in 1974. While the system was far from perfect and eventually fell apart, it is notable that there was a substantial period of time when  reforms reined in the power of money in politics. It turned out that, for a time,  politicians -- with the promise of public funds to cover the cost of their campaigns -- were willing to abandon the toxic fundraising circuit that otherwise consumed most of their time. It is time for reform once again. The nation must remember the lessons from Watergate -- not just  what went wrong, but also  how Congress was able to improve the way in which we govern in response to a scandal that rocked the nation.

"It is important to first understand that no gay Nigerian, as far as anyone knows, is seeking marriage -- in Nigeria. You can comb the breadth of our decidedly homophobic media (""Homosexuals are in trouble!"" crowed The Sun Newspapers, no doubt mirroring the excitement of its upright editorial board), and there is neither anecdotal nor empirical evidence of a clamor, even a quiet one, for gays to be married in churches, mosques or courts. Still, our legislators were hard at work over a considerable number of weeks while the rest of sane Nigeria, in a state of suspended disbelief, ignored them; convinced that, in a country with pressing issues such as fuel subsidy removal and debilitating insecurity, this frivolous legislation would not see light of day. Until yesterday when, of course, it did. Our elected representatives in the Senate, armed with their version of our National Moral Code, took time off urgent national issues to tackle the even more urgent evil of gay marriages. Before we could catch our breaths, our over-paid and under-worked Senators had legalized homophobia. According to the law, not only is gay marriage a crime punishable by a 14-year jail term, but ""any person who registers operates or participates in gay... organizations"" faces a decade in jail -- a clause that specifically targets the many active sexuality rights advocacy groups in the country. By the time the House of Representatives adds its predictable voice to this and the President signs it into law, writing this kind of piece might even risk jail time. It is important to note though that I and other aware young people who might sometimes be misidentified as the elite, may spend precious hours in vocal incredulity on Twitter and Facebook; shouting down a law that we can hardly do anything about - but we are sadly in the minority, at least for now. You see, in Nigeria, homophobia is alive and well. Nigerian senate passes anti-gay bill, defying British aid threat . Barely 10 days ago, the influential Nigerian blogger Linda Ikeji, shared what was supposed to be a touching story about a young man, Rashidi Williams, who had faced physical abuse for his sexuality. The comments that followed made my heart sink -- more threats of violence and death. And it wasn't a fringe minority; this is a thriving majority. Many Nigerians are convinced that homosexuality is ""of the devil"", against our ""culture"" and an encroachment of ""sad Western values."".A young man recently tweeted that ""homosexuality is the cause of the present rot in America."" What rot? America's thriving Silicon Valley? A democracy it should be proud of? Or the millions of dollars in aid that its government and people have invested in treating everything from malaria to HIV in our dear country? That's forgetting that the real giant of Africa, South Africa, is the continent's bastion of sexuality rights. ""Our values are our values,"" the pompous senate president David Mark replies to critics of the bill. Nonsense he can get away with, only because a large segment of our educated population is unaware that animals have been found to be gay. Dead cliches like ""God did not make Adam and Steve"" continue to get excited choruses from sedated congregations and people still declare with ignorance that ""homosexuality is not a part of our culture"", conveniently skimming over historical evidence of the practice in the East and North of the country; and blissfully unaware that the origins of homophobia in our societies can only be traced to the influx of foreign religions. Uganda's parliament takes no action on anti-gay bill . Indeed, you have to weep for a people that decry ""foreign imperialism"" on one hand, and then ignorantly hide under the cover of colonial influences to perpetuate intolerance. It's the same country whose ex-president recently paid a 'courtesy visit' to appease confessed terrorists; the same country where four men who savagely raped a girl and recorded it on video were defended by a police chief as ""dealing with snobbish girls."" Indeed, what else can one expect from a Senate that houses a member who defiled and took for a wife, a girl barely in her teens only last year? But gays -- who only pray for the right to be left alone since they do the rest of us no harm - are the mortal threat to our ""moral fabric"". They severely threaten the moral fabric of a nation which finds its place in the bottom of corruption rankings years in a row thanks to politicians like Mark who have sodomized the populace for decades now. Today, I am ashamed to be Nigerian. But it's not because a gang of morally questionable legislators has forced through a piece of legislation that is both irrelevant and irresponsible. It's rather because, in a country burdened by a lethal mix of misplaced priorities, confused sense of culture and an ignorant electorate, this intolerance is in fact a popular decision. We have allowed the politicians to fool us once again.","Nigeria joins other African nations outlawing homosexuality as bill passed in senate .

"In Egypt prominent liberals are now supporting a military-backed government overseeing a resurgence of post-Mubarak authoritarianism. Since the ouster of President Mohamed Morsy on July 3, those few remaining true to basic principles have found themselves marginalized as the goals of the 2011 revolution are squandered by the military. Many of the self-identified liberals who filled the streets of downtown Cairo on June 30 demanding Morsy's resignation justified their actions by pointing to a broken political system and the absence of democracy. In the eyes of protesters, Morsy used his electoral victory as a free pass to enforce an authoritarian style of government which denied its people basic human rights, supervised an increase in sectarian violence, and prioritized a regional Islamist agenda over the basic needs of the Egyptian people. Although these same ""liberals"" described their revolution as democracy in action, a considerable number of them have since supported the increasingly authoritarian decisions of the interim government which followed. The targets of these actions expand beyond the Muslim Brotherhood  to a comprehensive swath of Egyptian society as journalists and activists are detained, satirical programs are canceled by private networks, and the constitutional drafting committee proposes laws meant to restrict freedom of expression and NGO operation. Egypt's armed forces, the driving force behind these events, has simultaneously amended its oath to renounce loyalty to the elected president and sought after immunity for its top leaders. Egypt's liberals have responded to these moves with outward support on numerous occasions. Perhaps most disheartening is the explicit praise and backing coming from leaders of Egypt's National Salvation Front (NSF), a liberal-left coalition formed in opposition to Morsy's authoritarian rule. Current NSF leader and former Secretary General of the Arab league, Amr Moussa, presently chairs the same constitutional drafting committee unable to scale back military authority and secure basic civil liberties while Wafd party leader and NSF stalwart El-Sayyid el-Badawi, recently stated that the NSF will endorse General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's prospective presidential bid. Much of NSF's leadership has also supported the interim government's violent dispersal of sit-ins at Rabaa el-Adawiyya and el-Nahda, an event which claimed the lives of hundreds of Egyptians. More recently, the same supposed bedrock of Egyptian liberalism failed to condemn a court ruling that disbanded the Muslim Brotherhood and a constitutional provision granting the military immunity. On the surface, the predicament of liberals seems illogical. What would drive a high-ranking, liberal public official to back such a flagrant disregard for civil liberties and transparent government? The answer lies within the Egyptian electorate. Since January 2011, liberals have failed to instill their values within the political ideology of Egypt's voters. AMANPOUR BLOG: Egypt not on a 'proper path to democracy,' suggests Egypt deputy PM . In fact, since the revolution, more than two-thirds of the votes across parliamentary elections, the constitutional referendum, and the presidential election have gone to representatives of political Islam. Former presidential candidates, Hamdeen Sabahi and Amr Moussa, who captured roughly 20% and 11% of the vote respectively, are now opting for a new strategy: ""If you can't beat them, ban them."" The Muslim Brotherhood and its allies within political Islam cannot be beat fair and square so liberals are now opportunistically working with the military to efface them from Egyptian life. The result is a man-made political landscape handcrafted to undemocratically meet the needs of the country's most powerful liberals. The events following June 30 have rendered Egypt an inoperable landscape for the few citizens pursuing the genuine aims of liberalism. The isolated voices of figures such as Mohamed ElBaradei and Amr Hamzawy, who have spoken out against the interim government's authoritarian tactics have been shunned by their ""liberal"" brethren working in concert with the military's government. Consider ElBaradei, former interim vice president and director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency. A strong proponent of liberalism, ElBaradei expressed vehement disagreement with the interim government's plan to employ violence to crack down on Brotherhood protesters on August 14. Remaining loyal to his principles, ElBaradei resigned from his position when the interim government moved forward with this decision. In the meantime, ""liberals"" backing the government harshly criticized ElBaradei while his own Constitution Party filed a lawsuit against him. On July 31, Hamzawy, a prominent political scientist, former member of parliament, and head of the Egypt Freedom party thrashed his fellow ""liberals"" in Egypt's daily Al-Shorouk for betraying their principles in support of the military. His article was met with strong criticism and personal attacks. When fabricated headlines told of a relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood and the United States, he responded to rumors on his Twitter account, warning that the current regime was working to silence pro-democracy voices. We are now seeing a brand of liberalism in Egypt which does little to serve its own values and principles. Disenchanted onlookers and advocates of the goals of Egypt's 2011 revolution look on as so-called liberals work with the military to supervise the resurgence of authoritarianism. An Egypt which serves the interests of Bread, Freedom, and Social Justice cannot exist without a pluralistic society participating in an inclusive democracy, the principles of which struggle to survive within the minds of a powerless minority.

"President Barack Obama is the first American president known to have authorized the assassination of a US citizen. On September 30, 2011, Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen by virtue of his birth in New Mexico in 1971, was killed by an American drone in Yemen along with another U.S. citizen, Samir Khan, who grew up in New York City and Charlotte, North Carolina. Al-Awlaki had played an operational role in al Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula -- for instance, tasking the ""underwear bomber,"" Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, to bring down an American airliner over the United States. AbdulMutallab attempted to bring down Northwest Flight 253 over Detroit on Christmas Day 2009, but luckily his underwear bomb didn't detonate correctly. Khan had played more of a supporting role for AQAP as the editor of the group's online magazine, Inspire, which has inspired a number of terrorists, including the two brothers suspected of bombing the Boston Marathon last year. The killings of two American citizens by a U.S. drone without a judicial process caused considerable outrage on both the left and the right. Since then there has been far more public discussion of the secretive drone program, both by U.S. government officials, including President Obama, and at public hearings about drones in Congress.  But will al-Awlaki and Khan be the last Americans to die in a U.S. drone strike? U.S. officials are now debating whether to kill with a drone another American citizen who is part of al Qaeda and believed to be plotting attacks against the United States, a senior U.S. official tells CNN. The Associated Press first reported this development but is withholding the name of the targeted individual. There has been speculation but no confirmation about who the individual might be. At least a couple of other American citizens or permanent residents are known to play important roles in al Qaeda today. One name that has been mentioned in media reports is that of California-born Adam Gadahn, who for the past decade has operated as a leading al Qaeda propagandist. In 2006 Gadahn was the first American charged with treason in more than half a century. However, there is, at least so far, no public information that Gadahn has played an operational role in al Qaeda's terrorist plots, and therefore it is unlikely that he would be placed on a ""kill list,"" unless his role in al Qaeda has changed of late from propagandist to operational planner. According to a senior U.S. administration official, Gadahn is not the subject of the ongoing high-level discussions about whether a new name should be added to the kill list. In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee in May 2013, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder laid out the legal rationale the government uses to determine if an American citizen can be killed in a drone strike. In the letter, Holder said that based on Supreme Court decisions during World War II, merely being an American citizen does not make one ""immune from being targeted."" Holder also asserted that an American who poses an ""imminent threat of violent attack against the United States"" and is in a location where capture ""is not feasible"" could be killed. Holder explained that al-Awlaki ""plainly satisfied all these conditions"" as he had recruited the underwear bomber and instructed him to blow up an U.S. airliner ""when it was over American soil."" Al-Awlaki was also killed in a remote part of Yemen where a U.S. ground operation to capture him was deemed unfeasible by the Obama administration. There is a certain irony in Holder's legal reasoning. The FBI was monitoring al-Awlaki's e-mail account for years before he was killed. To monitor his e-mail, the FBI had to get a court order. Yet the decision to target al-Awlaki for death was made without any kind of judicial proceeding.  As Vicki Divoll, a former assistant general counsel for the CIA, nicely put it a year before al-Awlaki was killed in the drone strike, ""Awlaki's right to privacy exceeds his right to life."" Khan was killed in the same drone strike that killed al-Awlaki, but according to a senior U.S. official, that was unintentional and was merely a byproduct of Khan traveling in the same car as al-Awlaki when the drone strike occurred. In sum, Khan's role as the editor of Inspire magazine was not enough to put him on a kill list. When it comes to targeting a U.S. citizen for death, American officials, by their own account, will make particular efforts to determine how dangerous an al Qaeda operative that person really is. In the eyes of many Americans, however, a decision to kill one of their own should also be subject to judicial review.","Peter Bergen: U.S. officials reported to be considering targeting an American citizen .

"It's an idea that's radical in its simplicity. Swiss voters on November 24 will consider capping executive pay at 12 times what the lowest-paid worker at a company makes -- the premise being that a CEO should make no more in a month than a low-level employee earns in a year. The referendum, which is called the ""1:12 initiative"" and began after supporters gathered 100,000 signatures to put it on the ballot, is the kind of elegant solution to income inequality that we in the United States should consider more seriously. Not because the initiative, as it will be voted on, would work in the United States. It likely wouldn't. But because the idea of tethering top executive pay to SOME sort of concrete metric might stop American execs from floating further into the stratosphere. RELATED: The most unequal place in America . Here in America, the land of unequal opportunity, the CEOs of top-500 companies make in a single day about what it takes an average ""rank-and-file"" worker a year to earn, according to the AFL-CIO, the federation of unions. Switzerland has an average CEO-to-worker compensation ratio of 148 to 1, the group says. The average U.S. rate is 354 to 1, according to the AFL-CIO. Others put the ratio somewhat lower, around 273 to 1 in 2012. Either way, it's bad. And some U.S. companies are worse, still. JC Penney Co. has the highest ratio -- 1,795:1 -- on a list of 250 businesses compiled by Bloomberg. That department store's CEO got $53.3 million in pay and benefits in 2012, Bloomberg says. Workers, by comparison, earned only about $30,000 a year. So, like, whatever, right? What's Miley up to? It's tempting to excuse sky-high exec pay as either necessary (to attract top ""talent"" and because these inequality-era celebs are thought to increase the value of the companies where they exercise said talents) or inconsequential. The Swiss vote, for example, does nothing to increase average worker pay. It aims solely to clip cash from the very top of the economic ladder. But the pay ratio does matter, for a couple of common-sense reasons. One is that democracy starts to unravel if a few people become wildly, ethereally successful, while the rest of a country struggles. That was the best argument I heard on a recent phone call with Cedric Wermuth, a Swiss politician who has been one of the earliest proponents of the 1:12 initiative. Wermuth is not arguing for the enforced pay ratio on practical or economic grounds. His is a moral position -- that it is fundamentally unfair for the pay gap to be so wide, and that it allows a few uber-rich people to wield undo influence over society, economics and politics. ""There is a certain threat to democracy,"" he told me. RELATED: Is income inequality 'morally wrong'? Wermuth doesn't expect the 1:12 initiative to pass, but it does have about 35% to 40% support in recent polls, he told me, which is fairly staggering, and indicates people are fed up. Another argument against sky-high CEO pay is that it's unnecessary. Lynn Stout, a distinguished professor of corporate and business law at Cornell Law School, told me CEO pay has been rising for decades and that the Untied States is, in effect, subsidizing the trend with ""unlimited tax deductions"" on certain forms of pay. ""I'm a big fan of capitalism,"" she said. ""I love corporations and I love the business world and I think it's done more for peace and prosperity than people may realize. But there are structural reasons to think that executive pay and CEO pay are out of whack."" A $1 million salary worked for American CEOs from the 1930s to 1980s, she said. CEO pay, including options realized that year, jumped about 875%, to $14.1 million, from 1978 to 2012, according to the Economic Policy Institute. That increase, which is calcuated using 2012 dollars, according to EPI, is ""more than double stock market growth and substantially greater than the painfully slow 5.4% growth in a typical worker's compensation over the same period."" A 5% increase at the bottom versus 875% at the top. That's the same, right? ""What we've got is basically an arms race,"" Stout said, ""where the CEOs are competing on pay because they each want to have higher status than the others."" RELATED: Should we vilify the rich? Finally, all of this is bad business. Peter Drucker, who is recognized as the father of business management, famously said the CEO-to-worker salary ratio should not exceed 20:1, which is what existed in the United States in 1965, according to the Economic Policy Institute. Beyond that, managers will see an increase in ""resentment and falling morale,"" Drucker once wrote, according to a blog post by The Drucker Institute. That resentment is behind both the Occupy movement and the Swiss vote. So the question to me is not if we should do something about outlandish executive pay, but what, exactly. The 1:12 ratio would be unlikely to gain any traction in the Untied States, said Mark Borges, principal at Compensia, a company that does consulting on executive pay issues. He called the measure, which, according to Wermuth, includes stock options and other non-salary forms of pay, ""potentially draconian"" and said most ratios between CEO and worker pay he hears discussed deal with three-digit numbers. Twelve is a shock, I'll agree, and it's probably too extreme for the United States. It's clear, however, that the ways America has been trying to curb executive pay are not working -- perhaps because they're too convoluted and lack teeth. Shareholders get to vote on executive pay in the United States, for example, but their decisions aren't binding. Loopholes let CEOs dodge taxes on their income. And the Securities and Exchange Commission currently is asking for public comment on a proposal that would require companies to disclose the ratio of their CEO's pay to the median income of workers. (Tell them what you think of that here). But, according to some news reports, the metrics are so loosey-goosey it will be difficult to compare one company to another. That's still just a disclosure. Maybe we need an enforceable ratio. Something simple and real. The best idea I've heard comes from Stout, the Cornell professor. She has suggested making CEO pay non-deductible when it's higher than 100 times the minimum wage. I might take it one step further: Perhaps the United States should cap CEO pay at 100 times the minimum wage, combining Stout's idea with the Swiss proposal. It's just an idea, and it should be vetted by economists and the public. But, to me, that's the point. These are concepts that should be on the table in the United States. It's ridiculous that SEC attempts to make CEO pay ratios transparent are controversial in the business community. The conversation needs to move forward. Limiting CEO pay to 100 times the minimum wage would still allow top execs to be millionaires -- they'd earn a maximum wage of about $1.5 million per year, given the current federal minimum of $7.25 an hour, figured for a 40-hour work week. And here's the best part: If the fat cats wanted a pay increase, maybe the best way for them to get it would be to throw political weight behind a campaign to boost the minimum wage. That's a reform simple enough to make a difference.","Switzerland will vote on a 1:12 executive-to-worker pay ratio .

"(CNN)It should be a match made in heaven. But in the last decade the ""Wild Thing"" hasn't prospered in the blustery environs of Pebble Beach on the Monterey Peninsula in California. Since 1991, John Daly has played 10 times at the AT&T National Pro-Am, and not made the cut once. Thursday saw one of golf's most colorful -- quite literally -- characters tame the conditions, however, to shoot an impressive opening round of 65. The 48-year-old has had well documented battles with alcohol and gambling during his career but showed he can still mix it with the best with a combination of big hitting and short game prowess. Daly, a two-time major champion, carded seven birdies in a bogey-free round to sit one off the lead, held by fellow Americans J.B. Holmes and Justin Hicks. It was his best opening round since 2005. ""It's been a long time since I played that well in the first round of this tournament,"" Daly told the PGA Tour's official website. ""I still feel like I got somewhat of the length to play somewhat long golf courses. Not like some of the guys, but I just hit it in good positions and I left myself those six or seven pins that were back that I left myself good uphill putts. ""I had about four or five gimme birdies -- that always helps too. Didn't knock any over the green."" Daly is renowned for his colorful attire and is usually accompanied on the course by his caddie -- girlfriend Anna Cladakis, who also dresses accordingly. He has long been a popular player on the Tour, partly due to his hitting prowess -- he was the first man to average over 300 yards per drive over the course of a full season in 1997. But he also gained fans for being the antithesis of the traditional golfer with his flowing locks, alternative dress sense and, at times, controversial private life. He has twice been banned by the PGA, once for six months in 2008 when he was found drunk outside a restaurant in North Carolina and spent a night in jail. Daly's breakthrough came at the 1991 PGA Championship. Daly only got in as a ninth alternate and went on to win by three shots to claim his first PGA title. He followed that up with the 1995 British Open, defeating Constantino Rocca after the Italian had holed a miraculous 60-foot putt on the final hole to force a playoff. Daly has only two top 10 finishes to his name since 2006 and last came close to winning a title when he was beaten by 14-time major champion Tiger Woods in a playoff at a World Golf Championships event. He is playing the pro-am with Herm Edwards, a former NFL star who went on to coach the New York Jets and Kansas City Chiefs, and he was full of praise for his partner's upbeat attitude. ""He's just the most positive human being in the world,"" Daly said. ""No matter what happens, everything's positive. Me and (fellow player) Tommy Gainey were talking about it. We would like to go see him speak somewhere, just to get fired up.""","American golfer John Daly one off the lead after an opening round of 65 at Pebble Beach .

"The United States obtained a restraining order Monday to block the sale of a painting by Pablo Picasso valued at an estimated $11.5 million at the request of the Italian government, the Justice Department announced. The case involves a 1909 work by Picasso known as ""Compotier et tasse"" which had been offered for private sale in New York. American officials obtained a restraining order blocking any sale and preventing the painting from being moved after Italian authorities asked for help in connection to the prosecution of Gabriella Amati.

The couple allegedly worked with an official for the city of Naples and embezzled approximately $44 million of the city's tax revenues, according to Italian court documents. The Picasso was not stolen but was purchased with money that Amati and her husband allegedly obtained through criminal activity, said a U.S. law enforcement official. Agents working for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement located and recovered the painting in New York, where it was being offered for sale, on May 21.

"(CNN)Rory McIlroy can focus on his driving and putting after settling a protracted legal dispute with his former management company. The World No.1 avoided a potentially long and drawn out court case in Dublin, Ireland, after attempting to sue Horizon Sports Management, who in turn were counter-suing the golfer  by claiming the Northern Irishman owed them millions of dollars in commission on contracts up to 2017. McIlroy had labeled the contract he had signed with Horizon as ""unconscionable."" ""The legal dispute between Rory McIlroy and Horizon Sports Management has been settled to the satisfaction of both parties who wish each other well for the future,"" said a joint statement from McIlroy and Horizon. ""The parties will be making no further comment,"" added the statement. McIlroy reportedly paid $22.8m million plus costs to settle the case. In an interview with CNN's Living Golf show month, McIlroy insisted the case had been about taking ""control of things myself."" He added: ""If there's one good thing that's came out of all of this, it's being able to set up my own management team and my own management company. ""That's been huge. Even after all of this, having a great team around me and a great team in place, that's all been worth it."" The period under dispute coincided with McIlroy's sponsorship deal with Nike, which was reported be worth around $100m. McIlroy, who won the Dubai Desert Classic last weekend, was not in court when the settlement was announced, though he did make a brief appearance on Tuesday. The 25-year-old had claimed that the fees charged by Horizon were excessive, while simultaneously being accused of breaching his contract and owing outstanding fees. McIlroy terminated his contract with Horizon in 2013 to set up his own company.","Rory McIlroy settles legal dispute .

Chicago's Little League team named for the baseball icon -- who broke his sport's color line -- is headed to the Little League World Series championship, after topping Las Vegas in the U.S. title game on Saturday. The Jackie Robinson West squad -- which is composed entirely of young African-Americans -- will square off with the tournament's international champions from Seoul, South Korea, in Sunday's final. The South Koreans advanced after crushing Japan 12-3 earlier Saturday. Chicago entered its own contest Saturday as the underdog. Its foe, Las Vegas, had beaten every team it faced -- including Chicago, which it crushed by a 13-2 score. But this time proved to be very different. The two squads were tied 3-3 after the first inning, before the Jackie Robinson West entry jumped ahead by one run the next inning. Las Vegas took the lead in the fifth on a two-run home run by Brad Stone, only to have Chicago answer with three runs of its own. Ed Howard moved from his usual perch at shortstop to pitcher in the sixth and final inning and -- with a game-ending double play -- sealed Chicago's 7-5 win. That victory set off jubilant celebrations at the game in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, as well as Chicago, including among locals who cheered after watching the final outs at a Cubs game at Wrigley Field. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel credited ""their positive attitude and success on the field (for rallying) people from every neighborhood."" The boys from Chicago's South Side also got hearty congratulations from outside the Windy City, including ex-Chicago White Sox great and baseball Hall of Famer Frank Thomas and longtime President Barack Obama adviser David Axelrod. ""Congrats to the Chicago Little Leaguers on winning the US title!,"" tweeted Steve Kerr, a former standout with the NBA's Chicago Bulls and now coach of the Golden State Warriors. ""So inspiring to see the poise and skill at such young ages. Awesome.""","People inside, outside Chicago celebrate their team's U.S. championship .

"What was once an above-ground freight train line has become a major tourist attraction in Manhattan's popular Meatpacking District. Open to the public since 2009, the High Line elevated park isn't quite complete. A groundbreaking ceremony to mark the start of construction on the third and final section of the park was held last week, hosted by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Friends of the High Line co-founders Joshua David and Robert Hammond. ""The park has become a local treasure and an international icon, as well as an important generator of economic growth for our city,"" said Bloomberg. The heart of Midtown Manhattan . The new section of the High Line will be built in three phrases. The first phase, expected to be completed in 2014, will cost an estimated $90 million, financed by a combination of public funds and private donations. It will extend from 30th Street to 34th Street to the west of 11th Avenue and will feature an interim walkway passing over Midtown's Western Rail Yards. The second phase will be built to the east of 10th Avenue, as well as an area where the High Line will pass through Coach's new headquarters building at 30th and 10th avenues. Finally, the third phase will upgrade the interim walkway and the western section of the first phase. Part of the West Side Improvement Project, the High Line opened in 1934 and allowed train traffic to run on tracks elevated 30 feet to put a halt to the years of accidents that had occurred at street level. ""An extraordinary"" accomplishment . Friends of the High Line, which advocates for preservation of the historic structures, was founded in 1999 by  David and Hammond in response to a group of property owners who called for its demolition, according to the High Line website. ""In the decades to come, long after the final section is open to the public, the High Line will serve as a profound reminder of the extraordinary things we can achieve when the public and private sectors work together for the common good,"" said Bloomberg.","The park will extend up to 34th Street into the heart of Midtown Manhattan .

"(CNN)  -- He has been captured by bank surveillance cameras in four states, sneering and holding a pistol sideways during heists. The FBI is searching for this suspect, who they say has robbed at least 10 banks in the South. Now authorities hope to catch the serial bank robber by plastering his image on electronic billboards throughout the South. The FBI is searching for the suspect, who they say has robbed at least 10 banks in Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. The brazen bandit has been captured in surveillance footage sporting the same close-cropped hairstyle and goatee in many of the holdups. He does not seem to make any effort to cover his face and sometimes is seen aiming a handgun sideways, showing his tattoos on both forearms as he gestures at bank employees. ""It is uncommon to come in to a bank and show his face like he does,"" said FBI agent Kevin Keithley.  Watch how the FBI hunts bank robbers » . The FBI has tracked the bank robber's path on a map that crisscrosses the southern United States. The billboards that went up Monday roughly follow the path that the bank robber took, the FBI said. The billboards are in Alabama, Kentucky, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia, the FBI said in a statement. His odyssey has spanned more than 600 miles north, from Charleston, South Carolina, to Louisville, Kentucky, and about 500 miles east, from Knoxville, Tennessee, to Edenton, North Carolina. The robberies started in May and the most recent one was last week in Tennessee, Keithley said. The suspect is described as white, about 25 years old, 5 feet 9 to 5 feet 11, 170 to 175 pounds. He has short, reddish-brown hair and an unshaven goatee, the FBI said. The suspect has not yet harmed anybody in the robberies but the FBI considers him extremely dangerous. ""This guy has made no effort to hide the gun,"" Keithley said. ""He has threatened the use of it in every bank robbery he has committed. He has put the gun in the faces of tellers, threatened to use the gun against them. So we want to get this guy in custody before he harms anyone.""  In surveillance video of a robbery in Fletcher, North Carolina, the suspect is seen talking into a handheld radio, said an FBI official involved in the investigation. In a South Carolina robbery, a wireless phone device is seen on his ear. ""That prompted us to look at the prospect of another suspect out there helping him, and we continue to look for that angle but have no leads into that as of now,"" the FBI official said. Authorities are also working with police agencies, corrections departments and others who use facial recognition technology, the official said, and are working with corrections departments on tattoo identifications, recorded by prisons in some states. Since the national billboard program began in 2008, the billboards have been directly responsible for the apprehension of at least 20 fugitives, said Stephen Emmett, spokesman for the FBI's Atlanta office. ""We try to reserve the billboards for the more mobile, more egregious, violent offenders, because we understand we're pulling resources away from a corporate entity, and we try not to take advantage of that,"" he said. ""But they are a very valuable tool to law enforcement in these type of cases where the individual is highly mobile and very dangerous."" The bank robbery suspect has distinctive tattoos on his forearms, Emmett noted. ""Somebody will recognize these tattoos. Somebody will recognize this individual. The remarkable thing about this serial bank robber is that he did not attempt whatsoever to disguise himself. The photographs from these cases are very good, very detailed. The public will know who this individual is."" He said his past experience, as well as statistics, show that ""there are addiction issues with the majority of these bank robbers, and that provides a bad additional ingredient to this bank robbery scenario. You have an individual going into a bank with a gun, in a reckless manner, and now he might actually be on drugs and strung out on drugs. So that makes this even more imperative, to get this individual off the street before anybody gets hurt and to get him the help that he needs."" Robbing banks is not as lucrative as the public might believe, he said, and ""with addiction-type motives by these robbers, they tend to get only enough money to get their next fix."" It's possible the suspect's family members may not know of his activities, Emmett said. ""He's an individual that we want off of the street in the worst way,"" he said, ""and we feel these billboards are a tool. We feel the photographs from the banks are going to make that happen."" The FBI asks anybody who knows the bank robber or who has information in the case to call 423-282-8090. A reward is being offered. CNN's John Murgatroyd contributed to this report.","Bank robbery suspect does not seem to make any effort to cover his face .

"(CNN) -- Charlie Hunnam didn't drop out of ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" because he didn't want to play the lead, Christian Grey. He dropped out because the timing had him on the verge of a nervous breakdown. ""I wouldn't have signed up in the first place if I didn't want to do it,"" the ""Sons of Anarchy"" actor, 34, has said. ""It was a really, really difficult time in my life."" Hunnam was initially cast in the adaptation along with Dakota Johnson in September 2013. But by the following month, Hunnam had parted ways with the project, citing scheduling conflicts. That part, the actor now says, is true. Between his work on FX's ""Sons"" and his commitment to Guillermo del Toro's 2015 release, ""Crimson Peak,"" there just wasn't a lot of room for ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" no matter how badly Hunnam wanted it to work. ""I was going to finish 'Sons' at like 11 p.m. Friday night, get on the plane Saturday morning to Vancouver for 'Fifty,' missing the whole first week of rehearsal and start shooting Monday morning,"" Hunnam said. ""And I was going to shoot that film, wrap that on the Wednesday and the following Monday I was going to start shooting 'Crimson Peak' in Toronto. I just had like ... frankly, something of a nervous breakdown."" Explaining 'Fifty Shades' wild success . The intense reaction to the ""Fifty Shades"" casting news didn't help. Fans were particularly livid about Johnson landing the part of naive student Anastasia Steele, but Hunnam also felt the pressure. ""I just said 'I can't' ... to fail on such a grand scale,"" Hunnam recalled. "" 'Fifty's' going to be massive; it's going to be huge. I really didn't want to fail on such a grand scale, and I just couldn't transition from ('Sons of Anarchy's') Jax Teller to Christian Grey in 48 hours. I bit off more than I could chew, and it was painful. I loved the character, and I wanted to do it."" Instead of Hunnam, moviegoers will see relative newcomer Jamie Dornan in the role of Mr. Grey. The film, which recently debuted its first trailer, opens February 13.","Charlie Hunnam said he had a nervous breakdown over ""Fifty Shades of Grey""

"It was a moment Jose Diaz knew he didn't want to miss. The day laborer and undocumented immigrant waited for more than 10 years to see it. ""I missed work today,"" he said, ""but I felt like I had to be here."" Diaz was in the crowd cheering after California Gov. Jerry Brown signed a law Thursday that will allow undocumented immigrants to get driver's licenses in his state. ""This is only the first step,"" Brown said from the steps of Los Angeles City Hall, adding that he hopes other states will follow California's example. ""When a million people without their documents drive legally and with respect in the state of California, the rest of this country will have to stand up and take notice,"" he said. ""No longer are undocumented people in the shadows. They are alive and well and respected in the state of California."" The new measure, known as Assembly Bill 60, requires the California Department of Motor Vehicle issue driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants who can prove their identities, have established California residency and pass driving exams. The law goes into effect no later than January 1, 2015. Details about how the new licenses will look and the exact process for obtaining them are still in the works. But even so, supporters of the measure cheered the signing of the law. ""To have a license is not a luxury. It is a necessity, because in cars we go to work, to school and shopping and without a license really we are limited in many things,"" said Frida Hinojosa, an undocumented immigrant. For more than a year, driver's licenses and other state benefits have been at the heart of a battle in the nationwide immigration debate. Supporters of licenses for undocumented immigrants argue that it's safer to have more drivers trained and insured, and opponents argue that such systems are rife with fraud. The rules vary from state to state. In January, New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez said she would push to repeal the state law allowing undocumented immigrants to obtain driver's licenses. That same month, the governor of Illinois signed a new law that would allow undocumented immigrants to get temporary licenses. In at least 45 states, officials have said recipients of deferred action -- the Obama administration's program for young undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children --  are eligible for driver's licenses, according to the National Immigration Law Center. But in some states, like Arizona and Nebraska, officials have stepped up efforts to stop licenses from being issued, the law center said.","Gov.

"(Fast Company) -- Amazon just revealed its own specially curated version of the Android Marketplace, but has chosen to label it the ""Appstore."" Apple, in turn, has now sued Android for trademark violation. The move is a not-so-subtle shot across Amazon's bows. The suit was filed last week, but has emerged at more or less the same time as Amazon's official unveiling Tuesday of its Android Appstore -- Amazon's version of the free-for-all Google Android Marketplace that, on launch, contains 3,800 apps. It will operate under similar constraints, controls and profit sharing with developers as Apple's version, in the hopes that it will be distinguished from other Android app markets by being ""safer"" and containing higher quality apps. But it's the name Amazon's chosen (the Amazon Appstore) that's got Apple rattled. Apple filed a trademark protection over the phrase ""App Store"" after the release of the iPhone 3G, making what an independent observer may deem a sensible business move -- especially since the App Store is now earning Apple a slight profit, and its archive of apps for iPhone and iPad (and now the Mac too) is an incredibly potent advertising lever. As a result, the computer giant is now suing to prevent Amazon from using the phrase ""Appstore"" in any way, including marketing, and is also seeking damages. The accusation is that it's a direct trademark infringement that may ""confuse and mislead customers"" according to an Apple spokesperson, which is the kind of half-true legal phrase often trotted out in cases like this. The App Store label is a big bone of contention to many folk at the moment. Back in January, Microsoft postured against Apple's trademark, and has asked the USPTO to void Apple's trademark request on the grounds that the phrase ""'app store'"" is generic for retail store services featuring apps and unregistrable for ancillary services such as searching for and downloading apps from such stores."" Microsoft was moving to protect its plans for Windows Phone 7 app store sales, and seemed ignorant of the irony in its request--as you may recall, MS's best-selling product is dubbed ""Windows,"" which would definitely seem an arbitrary label and has a very precisely-defined generic use in computing environments that long predates MS's use of it. But what's Apple really trying to do here? One may suspect that Apple is actually mostly peeved that Amazon is trying to leverage off Apple's own successful brand to push sales of a rival smartphone and tablet PC platform -- Android. The two companies have a complex friend-and-foe relationship, and Amazon's Kindle e-book reader app is prominent in the iPad (and iPhone) App Stores, while its Kindle e-reader device is almost pitched as a direct competitor to the iPad. The move to defend Apple's trademark indicates that Apple will act to aggressively protect its App Store ecosystem from challengers, which may include any plans Amazon has to expand its Google Android efforts.

"A puppy was used to lure two Amish girls into a car in upstate New York, with the captors plotting to enslave the sisters, authorities said. Nicole Vaisey, 25, told investigators that she and her boyfriend, Stephen Howells II, 39, were on a ""shopping trip"" for ""slaves"" when they allegedly kidnapped the girls, according to a detective. The girls were picked up at a vegetable stand outside the sisters' family farm about 50 miles from the Canadian border on August 13. New details about the abduction in Oswegatchie emerged during a preliminary hearing in St. Lawrence County on Thursday.  Detective Sgt. Brooks Bigwarfe detailed the couples' alleged plan and kidnapping of the girls, as related to him by Vaisey. ""They had been planning this for several weeks,"" Bigwarfe said. Howells and Vaisey drove to the farm, pulled up to the stand in a location where they couldn't be seen, and waited for the girls -- ages 6 and 12 -- to approach the car, Bigwarfe said. Howells allegedly scoped out the stand the previous week. Howells asked the girls whether they wanted to pet the dog, a Doberman pinscher-golden retriever mix named Kaleidoscope, police said. When the older sister grew suspicious, Bigwarfe said, Howells pushed the girls into the back of the car. ""When he started forcing them into the vehicle, they were both screaming and yelling,"" Bigwarfe said. The girls were held captive for nearly 24 hours, during which they were handcuffed together, shackled to a bed and sexually abused, according to the sheriff's department. With widening media coverage, a large police response in the area and an Amber Alert, though, Bigwarfe said the couple began to worry and decided it was too risky to keep the girls. Howells abandoned the two girls in an isolated area 12 miles from where they were being held, Bigwarfe said. ""There's no doubt in my mind that if they were successful they were going to continue with future acts,"" said Mary Rain, district attorney for St. Lawrence County. Howells' attorney, Amy Dona, declined to comment Friday. Vaisey appeared at the hearing wearing a bulletproof vest, according to her lawyer, Bradford Riendeau. Riendeau alleged his client was in a master-slave relationship with Howells and that she was not the mastermind of the planned kidnapping. ""I don't think she had any control over what went on in the relationship. That was the essential ground rule of it,"" Riendeau alleged. ""He told her what to do."" Fowler Township Justice Paul Lamson ruled that there was reasonable cause to believe Vaisey committed a felony and ordered her held without bail. Howells waived his right to a hearing and did not appear in court Thursday. Howells also was being held without bail, Riendeau said. The two were charged with second-degree kidnapping and face up to 25 years in prison if convicted, according to Riendeau.","Couple used a puppy to lure two Amish sisters to a car, according to the sheriff's department .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Virginia couple accused of crashing President Obama's first White House state dinner on Tuesday are named in at least 16 different civil suits in Fauquier County, sometimes as plaintiffs, sometimes as defendants. A trawl through court records on Thursday revealed a more complete picture of Tareq and Michaele Salahi, who have left an extensive paper trail in federal bankruptcy and state court filings. The couple was spotted rubbing elbows with the likes of Vice President Joe Biden and Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel at Tuesday's dinner, but the Secret Service says they were not invited. A Secret Service checkpoint ""did not follow proper procedures"" to determine if the two were on the guest list, said Edwin M. Donovan, a Secret Service special agent, in a statement. The incident represents a security breach for the White House at the Obama administration's biggest social event to date. More than 300 guests, including Cabinet members, diplomats and Hollywood celebrities, attended the dinner in honor of visiting Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The couple did not respond to CNN requests for comment Thursday. ""At this time the Salahis will not make any formal comments regarding the rumors and media speculation surrounding the White House state dinner,"" their publicist, Mahogany Jones, said in a statement. ""Their counsel, Paul W. Gardner Esq., states emphatically that the Salahis' did not 'crash' this event. We look forward to setting the record straight very soon."" Asked for comment on the Salahi's legal difficulties, Jones said in an e-mail, ""We will begin doing press and media next week providing exclusive interviews and press junkets. If you would like to be considered in our media circuit we request that you hold your proposed published profile until then."" A page on Facebook, apparently maintained jointly by the Salahis, paints them as high rollers, listing their interests as polo, wine, and diplomatic relations, among others. A separate Facebook fan page dedicated to Michaele that appears to be run by her says, ""I was honored to be invited to attend the First State Dinner hosted by President Obama & the First Lady to honor India."" The page in her name is full of pictures showing her at social events around Washington. But the two also spend quite a bit of time in court, records show. One of the lawsuits against the Salahis was filed by Robb Levin of Fairfax, Virginia, who held his wedding at the Oasis Winery in August 2005. ""I have a judgment against them,"" he said by phone on Thursday. ""The settlement was for $15,000, plus interest from June 2008. They haven't paid a penny."" Levin contracted with the winery to provide vendors, such as florists and catering, for the event. But, he said, he discovered the winery was adding a ""significant profit"" to what the vendors were charging them. ""Vendors told me what they were charging. They were charging me two or three times as much,"" he said. When he tried to use his own vendors, he said, he was fined $1,000. After he signed a contract to hold his wedding there, ""They were very, very, very hard to get a hold of,"" he said. ""I remember [the contract] being very short and it just said to hold the date. When I went back, I found it said they could charge my credit card at will. At the time I signed it I don't remember all those pages being there. I don't remember a whole 8- or 12-page document,"" Levin said. ""There were thousands of dollars charged to my card with no explanation."" He fought with the Salahis, dealing mostly with Michaele, throughout the run-up to his nuptials, he said. ""They wanted more money and I wasn't releasing it,"" he said. ""They threatened me with lawyers. They threatened to cancel the wedding."" In the end, Levin said, he paid up to make sure the wedding went ahead, then sued the Salahis afterward to get his money back. Tareq and Michaele, meanwhile, were engaged in a long court battle with his parents over the winery. Court records show Tareq sued his mother, Corinne, and the case was dismissed. Corinne sued Tareq and the case went to trial. The outcome is not clear from a Virginia courts Web site. Tareq and Michaele won control of the winery in 2007, but it has run into debt since then. Oasis Winery filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in February, according to U.S. Bankruptcy Court records in the Eastern District of Virginia. Tareq Salahi is listed as company president in the filing. Creditors listed include the IRS, Fauquier County, the state of Virginia, several banks and American Express Corp., among others. The company claims about $335,000 in assets and $965,000 in liabilities. Among the debts listed are more than $60,000 in credit card debt and an ""unknown"" amount in federal back taxes. ""Debtor has not filed corporate taxes since tax year 2006,"" the filing says. ""Has always previously had business loss, with refund flowing to shareholders."" Also listed is a $65 parking ticket in Montgomery County, Maryland, nearly $3,000 in gasoline purchases to Exxon-Mobil and more than $95,000 in legal fees. According to the February filing, Oasis made $1.7 million in 2007 but only $35,000 in 2008. The filing lists two pending lawsuits against Oasis, one for more than $300,000 for ""catering services""  and one judgment against the company. Under ""repossessions,"" the filing lists a 2004 Aston Martin, which it estimates was worth $150,000 when it was repossessed in October 2008. Some $85,000 was still owed, according to the filing. In addition, a boat valued at $90,000 was repossessed in June 2008, with $56,000 still owed, according to court documents. The company also had closed a checking account, $3,800 in the red, about a year before the filing. Oasis owes $224,000 ""for rental of FedEx Redskins Suite and related hospitality services,"" according to court documents. The Chapter 7 filing, under which a debtor's assets are sold to pay creditors, followed an apparent effort to save the winery earlier. The business had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in December 2008, with Salahi's mother, Corinne, listing herself as president. A Chapter 11 bankruptcy is referred to as a ""reorganization"" bankruptcy, according to the federal judiciary's Web site. In addition to federal bankruptcy, Tareq and Michaele may now face criminal charges. The incident represents a security breach for the White House at the Obama administration's biggest social event to date. More than 300 guests, including Cabinet members, diplomats and Hollywood celebrities, attended the dinner. If they lied to federal agents in order to get into the White House dinner, that is a federal crime, said Fran Townsend , CNN national security contributor. The agents tasked with protecting the president ""did not follow proper procedures,"" Secret Service agent Edwin Donovan said in a statement, but said the gatecrashers went through metal detectors ""and other levels of security."" The Salahis are aspiring reality-TV stars who hoped to land roles in the forthcoming show, ""The Real Housewives of D.C.,"" by the Bravo cable network, The Washington Post reported. In a statement Thursday, Bravo said, ""Michaele Salahi is under consideration as a cast member, as such [series producer] Half Yard Productions were filming the Salahis on that day. Half Yard was only aware that per the Salahis they had been invited [to the state dinner] as guests."" Video of the dinner showed the couple walking past journalists into the event. The couple also appears to have posted pictures on Facebook purportedly showing them gaining access to high profile events during inauguration week, according to The Washington Post's Reliable Sources gossip column. Pictures on the couple's joint Facebook account appear to show them in the first family's glass-enclosed viewing area after a concert at the Lincoln Memorial, according to the Post. ""Tareq & Michaele were honored to be invited to President Obama's private viewing box at the Lincoln Memorial,"" the Facebook posting from inauguration weekend reportedly reads. ""Naturally this picture was taken after his departure."" Other pictures purportedly show them mingling with celebrities during inauguration weekend, including talk show host Oprah Winfrey at the Kennedy Center, according to the Post. CNN's Richard Allen Greene, Shannan Butler and Ashley Hayes contributed to this report.","NEW: Tareq and Michaele Salahi named in at least 16 lawsuits, filed for Chapter 7 in February .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A bloody war between Mexican drug cartels is no longer solely a south-of-the-border problem, members of Congress said Tuesday at a hearing on the issue. A member of the Mexican Federal Police patrols in Ciudad Juarez during a recent operation to fight drugs. The violence accompanying those battles has crept into the United States, and is believed to be largely fueled by money and guns from America, said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois. ""The drugs are coming north, and we're sending money and guns south,"" said Durbin, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs. ""As a result, these cartels have gained extraordinary power."" About 90 percent of guns seized in Mexican raids are traced back to the United States, according to the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, he said. About 2,000 firearms cross the border into Mexico daily, according to the Brookings Institution, he added. The subcommittee held a joint hearing Tuesday on the issue with the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control. The hearing focused on ways the United States can assist Mexican President Felipe Calderon's efforts to combat drugs and violence. In addition, American communities are seeing an increase in violent crimes related to the Mexican drug trade. In Phoenix, Arizona, in 2008, 366 kidnappings for ransom were reported -- more than in any other U.S. city, Durbin said, citing federal statistics. The vast majority of those, he said, were related to Mexican drug cartels. ""We're not winning the battle,"" Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard told lawmakers. ""The violence that we see in Mexico is fueled 65 to 70 percent by the trade in one drug: marijuana."" Goddard said he believes the United States can do more to remove the profit from such operations, as well as attempt to reduce the demand for the drugs. It's not only border states that are affected, either. Authorities believe cartels reached 230 American cities, up from 50 in 2006, Durbin said. In his home state of Illinois, far from the Mexican border, he said, cartels are believed operate in three cities: Chicago, East St. Louis and Joliet. Lawmakers and witnesses at the hearing universally applauded Calderon's efforts to deal with drug violence through actions such as sending troops into Ciudad Juarez. ""I think he needs every single bit of our support,"" said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California. However, the violence has skyrocketed, Goddard said, with a new and appalling trend: assassinations of police officers, prosecutors and other officials who are combating cartels. Perhaps even more horrifying, as the violence increases, so does the possibility that innocent citizens will be caught in it, he said. In at least one instance in Phoenix, criminals making a home invasion had the wrong house, he said. ""The casual fallout is going to be significant if we can't do something to try to assist Mexico in stopping it south of the border,"" Goddard said. Efforts by Arizona authorities to fight the violence include intercepting wire transfer payments to smugglers of drugs and of human beings, Goddard said. Between 2003 and 2007, he said, Arizona seized about $17 million in such transfers. However, a more comprehensive and regional effort is needed, he said, as the cartels, faced with increasing law enforcement surveillance in one area, will simply take their crimes elsewhere. And authorities must target the masterminds and leaders behind the violence, he said: ""Just arresting and deporting foot soldiers is a waste of critical assets."" Also Tuesday, a federal firearms official told the subcommittee there has been a ""troubling increase"" in the number of hand-grenades seized from Mexican drug traffickers recently, and that officials are concerned violence involving explosives could spill into U.S. border towns. ""In the past six months, we have noted a troubling increase in the number of grenades seized from, or used by, drug traffickers,"" William Hoover of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives told the Senate subcommittee. ""We are concerned about the possibility of explosives-related violence impacting our U.S. border towns,"" he said. Hoover did not give statistics about the number of hand-grenades seized by ATF, nor were statistics immediately available from the agency. Another federal law enforcement official  told the subcommittee he doesn't expect Mexican cartels to intentionally target U.S. officials and interests ""in the near term."" Anthony Placido of the Drug Enforcement Administration said the DEA does not believe ""that in the near term the cartels will deliberately target U.S. government personnel or interests or intentionally target U.S. civilians in the United States."" But, he added, ""defining spillover is a tricky business."" CNN Homeland Security Correspondent Jeanne Meserve, Mike M. Ahlers and Carol Cratty contributed to this report.","Senate subcommittee, caucus focus on ways to help Mexican leader's battle .

"After more than seven weeks of heavy fighting, Israel and Hamas announced a ceasefire Tuesday.  And unlike the other ceasefires announced in recent weeks, this one has no expiration date. The truce does not deal with core long-term issues on both sides.  But Israel agreed to ease the blockade on Gaza, open border crossings for more aid to pass through and extend the fishing limit off the coast to 6 miles, according to a senior Egyptian government official. Both sides agreed to return to Cairo for further talks, the official said. Hamas -- as it has after every battle with Israel -- declared it a victory.  But Israel said that Hamas finally accepted the offer that it had rejected repeatedly. ""We hope that this time, the ceasefire will stick,"" Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said. ""And I think now, as the dust will begin to clear, many people will be asking: Why is it that today Hamas accepted the very same Egyptian framework that it rejected a month ago? ""Ultimately, so much bloodshed could have been avoided,"" he added. Early in the conflict, Israel openly accepted Egypt's ceasefire proposal and slammed Hamas for not doing so.  Analysts saw Egypt's offers as one of many signs that the fighting was a proxy war for the broader Middle East, with key powers such as Cairo supporting Israel's fight against Hamas. In Gaza, cheers and celebratory gunfire erupted Tuesday. It's ""a day of the victories for our people,"" spokesman Fawhi Barhoum declared before a cheering, screaming crowd.  He praised the ""steadfastness and resistance"" in Gaza. ""The occupiers have tried to break them ... but the delegation spoke with one voice,"" Barhoum said of the negotiations. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who is not part of Hamas and lives in the West Bank, thanked ""Egypt and everyone who supported all the efforts that resulted in this agreement to end the aggression."" ""Together, we will rebuild our free country,"" he added. Abbas is with the Palestinian faction Fatah, the longtime rival of Hamas, which has run the government in the West Bank.  The two factions have battled and kidnapped each other's militants in the past but also repeatedly announced plans for a unity government, including one this year. The ceasefire went into effect at 7 p.m. (noon ET). ""In the end, Israel had two alternatives: either to occupy Gaza and destroy Hamas or to go to a ceasefire,"" a senior Israeli official said on condition of anonymity. ""Once we decided not to occupy Gaza, we pushed for the same conditions that led to the end of hostilities in 2012."" He said that he was ""not confident"" the ceasefire would last but that if Hamas wants it to hold, it will. Israel has said its military actions destroyed dozens of tunnels used by Palestinian militants to smuggle weapons used to attack Israeli civilians. One airstrike last week killed three high-ranking Hamas militants. Hamas later killed 18 of its own, accusing them of being informants for Israel. As news of the possible deal broke Tuesday, a flurry of violence was reported.  Warning sirens blared in southern Israel, indicating rocket attacks from Gaza.  Israeli emergency services reported that one person was critically wounded and two others were seriously wounded. Separately, three Palestinians were killed in an Israeli airstrike in Rafah, south of Gaza City, according to Ashraf el-Qedra, spokesman for the Palestinian Ministry of Health. 50 days into Israeli operation . U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry cheered news of the ceasefire Tuesday and called on all parties to comply with its terms. He also expressed some skepticism. ""We are approaching the next phase with our eyes wide open. We have been down this road before, and we are all aware of the challenges ahead. Both the Israelis and the Palestinians have strong views about their needs and the future of the region,"" Kerry said in a statement. ""Getting there will not be easy, but it is the only path to a future that the people on both sides deserve,"" it read. The ceasefire came on the 50th day of Israel's Operation Protective Edge, aimed at stopping rocket attacks against Israeli civilians and weeding out the militants' tunnels. More than 2,130 Palestinians have been killed in the conflict. It's not clear how many were civilians. The United Nations estimates that more than 70% were civilians, but Israel reports a higher number of militants among the dead. On Sunday, the Israel Defense Forces accused Hamas of routinely exaggerating civilian deaths ""for propaganda purposes."" Sixty-seven Israelis -- 64 of them soldiers -- have been killed, the United Nations reports.  A foreign worker in Israel was killed as well. A 4-year-old boy became Israel's latest civilian victim Friday when a mortar shell exploded in the parking lot of a kibbutz, Israeli rescue services said. On Monday night, Israel blasted a second residential tower in Gaza. The Health Ministry said 20 people were injured in the airstrike. The Israeli military said the building housed a Hamas ""command and control center."" Palestinians evacuated the building after warnings from Israel, the IDF said. Hamas acknowledges militants killed teens . Israel's operation followed the June abductions and killings of three Israeli teenagers who were on their way home from school in the West Bank.  At the time, Israel blamed Hamas. On Friday, a Hamas official admitted that the act was carried out by Hamas militants.  The official said the attackers did not tell their leaders. After the boys were buried, a Palestinian teen was killed.  Israeli authorities arrested the suspects, saying it was believed to have been a revenge killing. Gaza's zoo animals caught in crossfire of Israel-Hamas conflict . ""Any peace effort that does not tackle the root causes of the crisis will do little more than set the stage for the next cycle of violence,"" a spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general said Tuesday of the ceasefire. ""After 50 days of profound human suffering and devastating physical destruction, any violations of the ceasefire would be utterly irresponsible,"" he said.","A senior Israeli official says he's ""not confident"" the ceasefire will hold .
U.N. spokesman says root causes of crisis must be addressed .
Israel says Hamas finally accepted framework it rejected; Hamas declares victory .
Deal includes easing blockade, extending fishing limit, Egyptian official says ."
"The age of sailing ships may be over, but the romance and adventure they inspired still blows our hair back. This summer, majestic, one-of-a-kind tall ships may be coming to a city near you with their sails unfurled. In the Great Lakes, captains will repeat a waterborne war that hasn't been seen in 200 years. In Miami, a spectacular Spanish vessel will join a 500th birthday celebration. And the West Coast's largest tall ship festival promises a party for 200,000 visitors. First, let's take a moment to appreciate the tall ships. These boats are run by fearless sailors who sprint hand over hand up masts that stretch 100 feet into the air. While the ship rolls and pitches with the wind and waves, the crew members work in unison to unfurl massive sails measuring 45 feet wide. In a stiff wind, these sails can pull a 400-ton ship across the water at 20 mph. Tall ships ruled the ocean for centuries and changed the world from flat to round. Sadly, they also fueled the slave trade, while helping a new nation stretch from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Today, replicas and other traditionally rigged sailing vessels reflect some of the deepest-seated aspects of American culture: independence, mobility and team work. They remind us that because wind power was a renewable resource, hundreds of years ago, it opened the door to global travel for the first time in human history. Here are five events guaranteed to be a sailor's delight this summer: . 1. Tall Ships Challenge, Great Lakes region . This is the captain of American sailing events. From June through September, more than a dozen vessels from around the world will show off in spectacular fashion in Chicago; Cleveland; Green Bay, Wisconsin; Duluth, Minnesota; Toronto; Erie, Pennsylvania; and elsewhere. Without a doubt the highlight will be the bicentennial re-enactment of 1813's Battle of Lake Erie on Labor Day weekend. Never before has there been a better American opportunity to get your ""Master and Commander"" on. For the first time in 200 years, 17 tall ships will line up against each other and fire black gunpowder cannons to recreate the fight against the British that allowed the United States to secure its current border with Canada. Stars of this massive choreographed water dance include the stunning 210-foot, 86-year-old training vessel Sorlandet -- which will sail all the way from its home in Norway. Track the ship . Also look for the Pride of Baltimore II, a 100-foot replica of a 19th-century privateer schooner. But the big daddy of this battle is the 110-foot U.S. Brig Niagara, which bills itself as the largest wooden square-rigger in the United States that still takes people sailing. When the shooting starts at noon September 2, expect the sound of cannon fire to carry at least five miles to the nearby Put-in-Bay, Ohio, resort area. Tickets to board the warships range from $285 to $975. Expect about 1,000 pleasure boaters to make the 40-mile trek from Cleveland or Toledo, Ohio, or Detroit to the battle site in the middle of Lake Erie. ""Let's just say the west end of Lake Erie is going to be busy with a lot of traffic,""  Niagara Capt. Wes Heerssen said. The budget for this once-in-a-lifetime event totals around $850,000, which -- in addition to everything else -- will help pay for a fireworks display, concerts, food, entertainment, arts and crafts, the Ohio State University Marching Band and a live TV broadcast of the battle. 2. Festival of Sail, San Diego . They say it's the West Coast's largest tall ship festival. And in the California tradition, it's got a movie star. The festival draws about 200,000 visitors to San Diego's North Embarcadero area each Labor Day weekend -- many who come to see the tall ship HMS Surprise, star of 2003's ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"" with Russell Crowe. The Surprise is a replica of a 24-gun British frigate. The fun starts on August 29 when the tall ships strut into the harbor and fire off their canons before docking. ""We'll have two or three ships in a battle out here on San Diego Bay, and you can hear it from all over the place,"" said Maritime Museum of San Diego's Robyn Gallant. Also check out the parade, fun pirate culture and memorabilia. The Surprise shares the festival spotlight with another legendary tall ship: the Californian, a 145-foot replica of a cutter designed to catch smugglers during the 1840s Gold Rush. 3. Viva Florida 500, Miami . It's named the Juan Sebastian de Elcano, and what sets this tall ship apart is its immense size. It's damned long: 370 feet. That's longer than an American football field. Only two other tall ships in the world are larger. It's tall, too. Its four masts stretch nearly 160 feet into the sky. That's about as high as a 16-story building. This training vessel for navy midshipmen in Spain's Naval Academy gets around. It has circumnavigated the globe 10 times since its first launch in 1927. The Juan Sebastian de Elcano is named after the first commander to sail around the world in the 16th century. (De Elcano's captain, Ferdinand Magellan, was killed in the Philippines and didn't complete the voyage.) The ship will be in Miami to help Florida celebrate 500 years since Europeans discovered what's now the Sunshine State. The vessel is scheduled to anchor at the Port of Miami from May 1-6 with special events at nearby Bicentennial Park. The ship is scheduled to stop at Port Canaveral, Florida, on May 8-10. 4. Toshiba Tall Ships Festival, Dana Point, California . This festival kicks off on September 6, with a parade of nine tall ships sailing from South Laguna to Dana Point Harbor, cannons blazing. The weekend continues with on board tours, concerts, pirate and marine science educational events. 5. Tall ship Elissa, Texas Seaport Museum, Galveston . They say she's the real deal -- a piece of history. Back in 1877 craftsmen shipwrights in Aberdeen, Scotland, laid the iron hull for a three-masted sailing gem that would be christened Elissa. Now 136 years later, Elissa is a full-fledged Texan and is billed as one of the longest continuously sailed ships in the country, if not the world. At full speed, Elissa unfurls 19 sails. Like all full-rigged tall ships, Elissa has a multitude of rope lines that run the masts from top to bottom. ""I love the complexity of that system -- being able to, by hand, put together a sailing ship and keep it stable and safely sailing,"" said ship's bosun Mark Scibinico. The 205-foot ship recently underwent a major overhaul to repair plating to its hull, which suffered damage in 2008 from Hurricane Ike. Now it's as good as new, Scibinico said. Elissa relies on volunteer crews to run its paces. Day sails are offered in the spring and fall. Here's to a great summer, sailors -- may the wind be at your back and the skies red at night.","Summer packs a boatload of thrilling tall ship events .

"Washington (CNN) -- ""If we had been a split second slower, he could have been hit in the head."" It has been 30 years since the attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan. But for retired Secret Service agent Ray Shaddick, the memories of that gray, rainy day in Washington remain clear. It was 2:27 p.m., March 30, 1981. The 70-year-old president, barely two months into his term, exits the Washington Hilton after delivering a speech to leaders of the AFL-CIO. He walks out a side door to the hotel -- a door used more than 100 times by presidents in the previous decade. Waiting roughly 15 feet away stands a disturbed John Hinckley Jr., holding a .22-caliber revolver. The president waves to the crowd as he approaches the open door of his armored limousine. In less than two seconds, Hinckley fires off six shots. Press secretary James Brady is hit. Secret Service agent Timothy McCarthy and D.C. police officer Thomas Delahanty are also wounded. One bullet hits the limo's armored glass; another ricochets off the car. Lead agent Jerry Parr grabs the president's shoulders and pushes him down into the limo. At the same time, Shaddick shoves the president in the small of his back and slams the door shut. The motorcade bolts from the scene. ""I thought we got him out of there unscathed,"" Shaddick recalls. Halfway to the White House, Parr sees bright, frothy blood on a handkerchief pressed to the president's lips and announces a change of plans. They're headed to George Washington University Hospital. Shaddick, the shift leader riding in the follow-up car, doesn't ask for details because the radio's not encrypted. When they arrive at the hospital, Shaddick opens the door to the limo. The president gets out and says he's OK, but he's gone pale. ""You could see the ashen color to his face,"" Shaddick recalls. ""He was not all right."" Reagan walks on his own power through the emergency room doorway before collapsing. He says his rib hurts and complains that it's tough to breathe. A medical team quickly discovers that the bullet that ricocheted off the car struck the president below the left armpit. It looked like someone ""took a paring knife and jabbed him,"" Shaddick says. Reagan maintains his composure, famously telling his wife that he ""forgot to duck"" and asking the attending doctors if they're Republicans. In surgery, it takes an hour to reach the bullet and pull it from his chest, where it's lodged about an inch from his heart. Reagan loses more than 2½ quarts of blood. Doctors say he would have been within minutes of going into shock and dying had they not been able to replace the lost blood so quickly after the shooting. Opinion: How the shooting helped Reagan politically . Three decades later, what has been learned from Hinckley's assassination attempt? All of the normal Secret Service procedures were followed that day, Shaddick recalls. But Hinckley exploited a weak point in presidential protection: the fact that, at the time, it was still easy to get close to the president at certain points. Since the attempt on Reagan's life, magnetometers have been a more regular feature at presidential outings. People can no longer get so close without being thoroughly scanned. And while security perimeters have been pushed farther out, tents are now frequently used to shield presidential entrances and exits, according to journalist Del Quentin Wilber, author of ""Rawhide Down,"" a newly published book about the attempted assassination. Wilber also notes the regular, rigorous training that members of the presidential security detail undergo at the Secret Service facility in Beltsville, Maryland. Agents now train for roughly two out of every eight weeks. Enhanced training actually started in the late 1970s, but its importance was hammered home by Hinckley's attack. ""They don't want to risk agents thinking,"" Wilber says. ""They just have to act."" ""You wonder how the hell you respond that fast,"" Shaddick says. The training makes it ""almost instinctive."" If Parr and Shaddick had been even a second slower reacting to the attack, Reagan's skull probably would have been struck, Wilber says. In contrast, look at footage of Arthur Bremer's attempted assassination of Alabama Gov. George Wallace in 1972, he says. Agents assigned to the governor -- a presidential candidate at the time -- were much slower to respond, leaving the initial responsibility of trying shield him to others. Secure communications also became a more standard component of presidential and vice presidential life after the Reagan assassination attempt. Then-Vice President George H.W. Bush was en route to Texas when Hinckley struck. Bush immediately headed back to Washington, but the lack of a secure phone line between his plane and the White House contributed a brief sense of confusion within the administration. The result was Secretary of State Alexander Haig's infamous declaration that he was ""in control ... pending the return of the vice president."" Under the law, then-House Speaker Tip O'Neill, not Haig, followed Bush in the chain of succession. Test your knowledge of the shooting . Shaddick says that more extensive information-gathering on potential presidential assailants has become possible in recent years, partly because of the rise of the internet. None of the assailants of presidents or presidential candidates since 1960 -- Hinckley, Bremer, Lee Harvey Oswald, Sirhan Sirhan, Lynette ""Squeaky"" Fromme and Sara Jane Moore -- were on a Secret Service watch list at the time they attacked, according to Congressional Quarterly. In Hinckley's case, he had been arrested for trying to bring a gun on an airplane in 1980.  How close is Hinckley to freedom? Since Andrew Jackson survived a misfiring pistol in 1835, guns have been the No. 1 threat to U.S. presidents. Abraham Lincoln, James Garfield, William McKinley and John F. Kennedy all died at the hands of assassins with firearms. Theodore Roosevelt survived a chest shot from a .38-caliber revolver in 1912 when the bullet first struck a glasses case and manuscript in his front suit pocket. Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman and Gerald Ford also survived would-be assassins with firearms. Nine U.S. presidents attacked since 1865 . But the range of threats to the commander in chief has expanded dramatically in recent years. Certain high-impact explosives now ""can take a city block out,"" Shaddick says. You've got to be ""vigilant as hell"" to constantly be on guard against potential attacks. And still, mistakes happen. In 2009, Tareq and Michaele Salahi managed to slip into the White House, shaking hands with President Obama during his first state dinner. In 2005, a live grenade was thrown within 100 feet of a podium holding George W. Bush during a presidential visit to the former Soviet republic of Georgia. ""All a man needs is a willingness to trade his life for mine,"" Lyndon Johnson once said. Thirty years after the attempt on Reagan's life, that sentiment presents a greater challenge than ever for the men and women charged with protecting the president. CNN's James Polk contributed to this report.","Thirty years after Reagan's shooting, presidential protection is more comprehensive .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A former commanding general of the District of Columbia National Guard -- who ordered jets over the Capitol amid the September 11, 2001, terror attacks -- was among those killed in a transit train crash in Washington this week, authorities said Tuesday. The crash killed retired Maj. Gen. David Wherley Jr., ex-leader of the D.C. National Guard, and his wife, Ann. Retired Maj. Gen. David F. Wherley Jr. and his wife, Ann, both 62, were killed along with seven others Monday in the most deadly train crash in the history of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. ""He was as fine a public servant, as dedicated to the United States of America ... as anyone I have ever met,"" Washington Mayor Adrian Fenty told reporters Tuesday. On the morning of the September 11 attacks, Wherley, commander of the 113th Fighter Wing at Andrews Air Force Base, deployed pilots with orders from then-Vice President Dick Cheney to protect the White House and take out any aircraft that threatened the Capitol, according to the 9/11 Commission Report. ""They said challenge them, try to turn them away; if they don't turn away, use whatever force is necessary to keep them from hitting buildings downtown,"" Wherley told the Washington Post in a 2002 interview. Wherley, a 40-year military veteran, served as the commanding general of the D.C. Guard from 2003 to 2008. ""I am personally grieved by this unbelievable tragedy,"" said Maj. Gen. Errol R. Schwartz who succeeded Wherley when he retired.  See pictures of crash site » . The Wherleys are survived by a son, David, a noncommissioned officer in the U.S. Army Golden Knights; a daughter, Betsy; and one grandchild, according to the National Guard. The seven others killed in the collision were: train operator Jeanice McMillan, 42, of Springfield, Virginia; Mary Doolittle, 59; Lavanda King, 23; Veronica Dubose, 26; Cameron Williams, 36; and Dennis Hawkins, 64, all of Washington; and Ana Fernandez, 40, of Hyattsville, Maryland.","Maj.

"(CNN) -- Twelve-year-old Peter Mance knows every street before he sets foot in a city. It's not because he's visited before. It's because he's autistic and has an uncanny ability to memorize maps. ""He's actually a big help when traveling,"" jokes his mother, Kim Mance, founder of women's travel blog Galavanting and the Travel Blog Exchange, a community of travel writers and bloggers. Mance's other son, 10-year-old son Stephen, has used a wheelchair since surgery to remove a spinal tumor left him paralyzed from the waist down. Mance always has to make extra phone calls to ensure there's an accessible subway or hotel room, but that hasn't stopped her from vacationing with her sons all over the world. While she mostly travels for work, Mance says taking Peter on trips since he was diagnosed with autism at age 2½ helped him not get ""rutted into routine."" Some autistic children can't stand to have their schedules disrupted, she explained. ""By [traveling] consistently over time, he's developed ways to cope with being outside his routine,"" she said. To help comfort Peter, Mance created games -- like hunting to find his pajamas -- that he plays in every new place he visits. Traveling with children is difficult, but when children have wheelchairs or communication problems, it can be overwhelming for parents to plan even a weekend getaway. ""You cannot pick up and go like everyone else does. You have to plan your trip very carefully,"" says Jani Nayar, executive coordinator of the Society for Accessible Travel & Hospitality. About 2.9 million youths ages 17 and younger have a disability, according to the 2009 American Community Survey. Even if it requires extra planning, Nayar says, it's important for children with disabilities -- whether they're blind, deaf, autistic or use a wheelchair -- to ""get out of the house and travel like any other child."" Michell Haase, founder of TravelinWheels.com, a site that offers travel tips for disabled people, suggests that families ""start small."" ""It doesn't have to be the big trip to France,"" she said. For families that haven't traveled before, Haase suggests driving to a nearby city and trying a hotel stay. In 1990, the Americans with Disabilities Act required that hotels provide accessible amenities. But when booking a room, Haase says to be specific about your needs. ""Don't just ask if the room is accessible, because it means so many things to so many people,"" she said. It's OK to ask questions and request for a certain bed height or shower chair, she added. During trips, Haase has persuaded hotel managers to get rid of their shower chairs without supportive backs in favor of ones that people with balance issues, like her daughter Kelsey, can use. Kelsey, 18, uses a wheelchair because she has spina bifida, a condition that prevents the spinal cord from developing. She has traveled all over the country as a wheelchair athlete and is the national powerlifting champion for her weight class. Though Kelsey's mother plans ahead by making phone calls and researching accessible options online, the two have had their fair share of travel hiccups. The list includes being stuck in the rain at a rental car facility without an accessible shuttle and being stranded in excruciating heat when a Chicago trolley car was too crowded to fit her daughter's wheelchair. Regardless of the amount of planning, parents can't predict a broken subway elevator or an unexpected flight of stairs. ""I'm always having to be five steps ahead of the game and thinking what we're going to need. And then, when it doesn't work out, it becomes really frustrating,"" Haase said. Overcoming the intimidation of taking a trip is the biggest obstacle, Mance says. But once parents get over the learning curve of knowing where to go and how to get from point A to point B, traveling with a disabled child becomes second nature. ""Over the years, I've developed this sixth sense about which entrance is more likely to have a ramp or certain places that may be able to accommodate even just space between chairs at restaurants,"" says Mance, who has taken her sons to Japan, Morocco and several European countries. Sometimes, Mance has her autistic son, Peter, wear a button or T-shirt that says, ""I'm autistic. Please be patient."" The message is a friendly reminder to other travelers that her son isn't purposely acting out. ""You'd be surprised how somebody can get really irritable because they think your kid is misbehaving,"" she said. About one in 110 children have an autism spectrum disorder, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Though Mance says Peter looks forward to each excursion, not all autistic children handle new adventures well. ""There are some kids with autism that love to travel and do really well. For others, it can just be more challenging,"" said Lisa Goring, the vice president of family services at Autism Speaks. If a child thrives in rigid routines, Goring suggests parents tell their child in advance that they will be exploring a new place. Creating a book with pictures of the travel destination can also help children know what to expect. When planning a trip, find out if attractions in the area offer special programs. The Garden State Discovery Museum in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, has Open Arms Family Evenings several times a year. The program allows families with autistic children to explore the hands-on museum, which includes simulating scenarios such as visiting a doctor's office, buying fruit at a market and ordering food at a diner. Autistic children who struggle with daily activities benefit from the museum, said Judy Shapiro, director of sales and marketing. ""The more they can practice in a safe environment, the better they are in the real world because it's not new to them,"" she said. Parents who don't want to navigate cities may enjoy cruises that have accessible pools and programs just for kids. Nayar pointed out that many ships allow parents and their disabled children to attend youth activities together. The all-time best place to travel with a disabled child? The Magic Kingdom, mothers and travel experts say. ""Disney World is the nirvana,"" Haase says. ""We usually go to Disney World and almost forget that there's any issue."" Disney provides Guest Assistance Cards for anyone with a disability. Guests can use the cards to wait in separate lines for rides, and up to five members may go on the attraction with the cardholder. Mance recently took her kids to Disney World and said the pass allowed her family to get through the lines ""exponentially faster."" She said her son loved the graffiti-style signs with a wheelchair symbol because they were geared toward kids. ""He felt so accepted,"" she said. Disney also permits a family member to test a ride -- without waiting in line twice -- to gauge how a disabled child may react before he or she gets on. In case rides or crowds are too loud, Mance brings along ear plugs so Peter can block the noise. New York City is one of the most accessible cities in the country, according to Nayar. Besides accessible museums and public transportation, organizations are spearheading efforts to make theater productions more accessible. In June, the Alliance for Inclusion in the Arts kicked off the Broadway Accessibility Initiative, which aims to make Broadway shows more enjoyable for the deaf and the blind. At no charge, hearing impaired theatergoers may use I-Caption, a handheld device that displays dialogue, lyrics and show announcements. Visually impaired patrons may use D-Scriptive, an audio device that relates all visual elements of a show, including choreography, lighting, sets and costumes. The goal is to ""open up Broadway to an audience who has historically not been reached out to,"" said Sharon Jensen, executive director of Alliance for Inclusion in the Arts. Families that prefer outdoor recreation don't have to stay at home either. Almost all national parks have accessible hiking trails or activities like kayaking. Some state parks -- in states such as Wisconsin,  Pennsylvania and  South Dakota -- have accessible cabins that include kitchens with low counters, showers that fit wheelchairs and hospital beds with lifts. ""Traveling allows kids to see the world in a positive light, but planning a dream vacation isn't going to be simple,"" Haase said. ""Especially when they're disabled, you want them to have a good experience, so it's a lot of pressure,"" she said. But by not staying in the protection of their own home, Haase says, she and Kelsey are showing able-bodied people what they can change at hotels, restaurants and attractions to make life a little easier on others. ""It's one thing to have a law that says you have to do this,"" she said. ""It's a whole other thing to see somebody experience the struggle and then want to help them.""","Vacationing with disabled children may be challenging, but parents say it's worth the effort .

"Three European nations were notified about concerns over horse meat as early as a year ago, the United Kingdom's food safety agency said Sunday. The alerts -- sent last year on February 1, February 15 and March 7 -- identified Denmark, Hungary and Italy as countries that should investigate concerns about horse meat. There were posted by the EU's Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed portal. The UK Food Standards Agency said through a spokeswoman the alerts were just a few of many and the meat never entered the UK. ""These were three of several thousand such alerts circulated across Europe each year. These were followed up by the countries identified in the alert,"" Amy Cope said in an e-mail. She said the alerts involved horse meat substitution, but officials in one of the affected countries said at least one was for questions over one horse's ""passport."" Danish authorities sent out one alert after there were ""uncertainties"" regarding a slaughtered horse's paperwork, an official for the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration told CNN. The horse meat was sent from Denmark to Italy and officials sent out the alert to let Italian authorities know about their concerns about the paperwork, not the meat itself, Kim Sigsgaard said. Danish officials had no information on what happened with the horse after the alert was sent. A spokeswoman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in the UK said the issues of possible falsified horse paperwork and the issue of horse meat substitution are unrelated. February 2012 is six months before what had been thought to be the earliest possible time frame where horse meat had been discovered in products labeled as 100% beef. Swedish frozen food giant Findus had said that one of its suppliers told it contamination may date back to August. Consumers are concerned that as food producers try to keep costs low, the safety of what they eat could be compromised. The managing director of Waitrose, a grocery story chain in the UK, said in an editorial published in The Telegraph that meat -- indeed, all food -- is no longer a cheap commodity. ""If something good comes of the current scandal, I hope it is the opening up of a debate around the true economics of food and a determination on the part of everybody in the food industry to apply renewed rigour to their processes and testing regimes to ensure that customers can relax and enjoy the food they buy,"" Mark Price wrote. The scandal spread Friday, as UK authorities revealed the results of DNA testing on beef products and raided the premises of three more UK food firms. Of 2,501 tests carried out on beef products across the industry by noon Friday, 2,472 found no horse meat content above 1%, the Food Standards Agency said. The 29 positive tests involved seven products sold by five suppliers, according to the independent government agency. Another 962 tests are still under way, the agency said at a news conference. Fifteen of the positive tests were for the lasagna products sold by Findus that first triggered the current horse meat buzz in early February. The others concerned beef products sold by supermarket chains Tesco, Aldi and The Co-operative, and burgers made by catering supplier Rangeland. Tesco and Aldi issued statements saying they are boosting testing on meat products to protect customers, restore confidence and ensure product quality. Jim Smith, group technical director for Tesco, said the company will ""no longer work with the suppliers who fell below our very high standards."" The Food Standards Agency declined to give details of the names or location of the three food premises raided Friday. Investigations are ongoing, but authorities cannot rule out the possibility of arrests, it said. Authorities across Europe have been scrambling to get a grip on the crisis over rogue horse meat in beef products. The European Union intends to begin testing meat across all 27 member states, it confirmed Friday. It called for testing 10 to 150 samples per country and at least five tests per country for the presence of the drug phenylbutazone, also known as bute, which is approved for horses but is not allowed to enter the food chain because it can be harmful to humans. Unauthorized horse meat has been discovered in a variety of products labeled as beef that were sold in supermarkets in countries including Britain, France, Sweden, Switzerland, Germany and Ireland. The meat industry was first thrust into the spotlight last month when Irish investigators found horse and pig DNA in hamburger products. The discovery of pig DNA in beef products is of particular concern to Jews and Muslims, whose dietary laws forbid the consumption of pork products. Jewish dietary laws also ban the eating of horse meat.","Denmark, Hungary, Italy notified last year about possible issues .

"The head of Naval Warfare Special Command had warned Navy SEALs against betraying their promise to maintain secrecy just days ahead of a SEAL's  ""60 Minutes"" interview defending his publication of details from the Osama bin Laden mission. The open letter specifies that the warning holds even after a mission is over, and it scolds those seeking public credit. The admonition is seemingly directed both at Matt Bissonnette -- who revealed his role on the 2011 bin Laden mission with ""60 Minutes"" on Sunday -- and at a SEAL at the center of an upcoming Fox News documentary. It was Bissonnette's second interview with the CBS show. The October 31 letter from Adm. Brian Losey obtained by CNN was addressed to ""teammates"" and sought to shame those who sought public acclaim, reminding SEALs ""the most important credit we can garner is the respect of our Teammates and Partners."" Letter speaks of core values, private accolades . ""We do not abide willful or selfish disregard for our core values in return for public notoriety and financial gain,"" Losey wrote. ""Any real credit to be rendered is about the incredible focus, commitment, and teamwork of this diverse network and the years of hard work undertaken with little individual public credit.  It is the nature of our profession,"" he also wrote. The missive was first reported by SOFREP, a website that covers the Special Operations community. The new story of the death of bin Laden . The letter is not the first. Losey's predecessor also sent a letter reminding SEALs to keep the confidence of the mission. While Losey does not mention the bin Laden raid directly, it's the publication of those details and the mission to free the captured sailors of the Maersk Alabama in 2009 off the coast of Somalia that have gotten much publicity. SOFREP has identified the so-called ""shooter"" of bin Laden, who was the unnamed subject of a Esquire magazine article last year and whose identity will reportedly be revealed in an upcoming Fox News documentary. CNN has not confirmed the name of the SEAL is accurate. The claims in the Esquire article were met with skepticism by those in the SEAL community who said the close quarters and darkness and intense shooting made it difficult to determine whose bullets killed bin Laden. Peter Bergen in 2013: Who really killed bin Laden? Criminal inquiry into Navy SEAL . The Pentagon and Justice Department are conducting a criminal inquiry of Bissonnette and his bestselling book about the raid in Pakistan. That inquiry has delayed a legal settlement between the government and the author over profits from the book. Bissonnette didn't seek the legally required government review before he published the book ""No Easy Day"" in 2012. The book recounts what he says is his role as one of the SEAL Team Six members who shot and killed bin Laden. The man who hunted bin Laden, Saddam and the pirates . The Pentagon will not even confirm that Bissonnette was even on the raid. Navy Cmdr. Amy Derrick-Frost, a spokeswoman, would only say of Bissonnette and his connection to the mission: ""If in fact this individual was associated with the military unit that carried out the UBL raid ... is yet to be determined.""

"The Duchess of Cambridge is one of the world's biggest, if not the biggest, stars right now. Twelve months on from her marriage to Prince William, she is credited with reinvigorating the British monarchy and arguably helping secure its future. It may look like Catherine, or Kate as she is popularly known, has breezed through her first year of official engagements, but the apparent ease belies a great deal of hard work and careful planning. When a senior royal source earlier this month told CNN that Kate had ""achieved her objectives,"" it was no surprise that he used the language of boardrooms. St James's Palace, which looks after after the duke, duchess and Prince Harry, has deliberately taken a corporate approach to Kate's role. Aides equate her to a chief executive and regard themselves as advisers -- she calls the shots but they are there to help. This has been the case since the outset. Every element of Kate's wedding to Prince William last year -- from the cake to the trees in the church -- were either dreamed up by the couple or approved by them. Kate didn't go into this naively. She had been William's girlfriend for several years before they wed and she had already experienced the dark side of royalty. At one point, she had been forced to move out of London because of paparazzi aggression. By the time William and Kate announced their engagement, they both felt she was ready for the spotlight. The prince made sure the palace gave Kate the support she needed and this year she got her own assistant private secretary, Rebecca Deacon. The duchess has had the best available training, nearly all of it in-house. Palace staff provide day-to-day support but William has taken the lead, with backup from his father, Prince Charles, and grandmother, Queen Elizabeth. The palace didn't know how easily the duchess would take to official duties, but when William said she was ready, they trusted his judgment. As soon as the couple arrived in Canada for their first overseas tour last year, it was clear she had already mastered the walkabout. She has since gone on to complete the full range of public duties expected of a working royal. CNN's royal source confirms Kate has completed her ""induction"" as a ""fully fledged member of the royal family."" The palace is clearly thrilled. When the source talks about Kate's character, it reads like a wish list for a successful CEO: ""She is strong-willed. She knows her mind. She is professional. Not much fazes her. She is confident enough to handle it."" Kate's composure is also down to the fact that she feels comfortable with her appearance. She buys most of her outfits herself in regular stores such as Zara, LK Bennett and Reiss. She occasionally visits upscale stores like Burberry and Amanda Wakeley but usually arrives unannounced. Often, the first a designer hears that the duchess has bought an outfit is when she appears in public wearing it. Surprisingly, her outfits are often from previous seasons and the duchess isn't averse to bringing out old favorites. Kate isn't a fashion icon, even if she does have a huge impact on sales, but she does have an uncanny ability to pick something that suits her and the occasion. She knows how to make herself feel comfortable. Another element to the duchess's apparent ease in front of huge crowds of press and public is down to coping mechanisms. Gallery: Photographer's year with the duchess . Once she steps out of the car at a public engagement, Kate usually homes in on someone in the welcoming party or crowd. While that person is delighted by being center of her attention, they are also helping her block out the frenzy around her. It's not just a superficial exercise. The duchess wants to make the most of her visits, learning what she can, and she can only do this by engaging directly with the people involved. Royal photographers often complain that Kate shies away from their lenses hides or behind her hair. The royal source accepts ""she doesn't look at the cameras, but it's not deliberate. She blocks out the media. she forgets they are there. She has commented several times after an event that she forgot the cameras were there."" This may have helped with her first speech last month in the UK town of Ipswich, which was broadcast live globally via CNN. She had a potential audience of billions, but wasn't told until afterwards. Pre-warning would have added to the pressure. Although William had been coaching her via phone from the Falklands, an example of his hands-on role, her inaugural address was delivered in her own style: slow, controlled and measured. On occasion Kate has taken matters into her own hands. When a media frenzy erupted around her new puppy, the palace was inundated with queries about its name, but the duchess refused to let her new pet become a public relations issue. Instead she wanted the name -- Lupo -- to come out naturally, which it eventually did during a conversation with students at a school in the city of Oxford. The Lupo incident illustrates that the duchess clearly sees a line between her public and private lives. According to the palace source, Kate treasures the normality of her personal life. ""She goes to Starbucks, goes shopping and spends time with her family,"" he said. ""The palace takes an incredibly hard line on privacy so she can have a private life and go to Tesco [a superstore] and Starbucks. The princes get their normality from the [military] service."" And her late mother-in-law, Princess Diana, read what the papers said about her -- as does William -- Kate does not keep a close eye on how the media is covering her, but is mindful of their interest. The royal source says she is aware of her stardom and that it stems partly stems from Diana's legacy. She takes the comparison to Diana as ""a compliment"" but is clearly doing things her own way. So we've had the wedding, the full range of public appearances ... what next? The source tells CNN: ""The palace would never discuss, confirm or deny rumors about pregnancy until she is ready to announce it."" The duchess has passed her first year of royalty with flying colors, at least in the palace's view. William may not always feel comfortable in the limelight but, according to the source, his wife may have found her niche. ""For her, the public engagements are a joy. She enjoys it.""","Royal sources say Kate has coping techniques for dealing with pressures of public and media attention .

"In this case, the pictures apparently weren't worth a single word. The sign language interpreter at Tuesday's memorial service in Johannesburg for Nelson Mandela may have appeared to have been translating spoken words into gestures during the four hours he appeared on television screens around the world, but he was a fake, observers said Wednesday. ""The so-called 'interpreter' ... at FNB stadium has been dubbed the 'fake interpreter' and the deaf community is in outrage,"" said Bruno Druchen, national director of the Deaf Federation of South Africa (DeafSA), in a statement. ""He is not known by the Deaf Community in South Africa nor by the South African Sign Language interpreters working in the field."" The man showed no facial expressions, which are key in South African sign language, and his hand signals were meaningless, Druchen said. ""It is a total mockery of the language,"" he added. The service to commemorate the statesman, who died last week at 95, was broadcast to millions of viewers. While dignitaries addressed the crowd at Johannesburg's FNB stadium, the unidentified, suited man produced a series of hand signals that experts said meant nothing. ""It was almost like he was doing baseball signs,"" deaf actress Marlee Matlin told CNN on Wednesday, through a sign-language interpreter. ""I was appalled."" Though each country has its own sign language, all of them entail facial expressions, she said. She called his lack of facial expression ""a giveaway."" ""I knew exactly right then and there that he wasn't authentic at all, and it was offensive; it was offensive to me."" Others also took offense. On Tuesday, during the man's performance, a deaf member of the South African Parliament and vice president of the World Federation of the Deaf, tweeted that the man ""is signing rubbish. He cannot sign. Please get him off."" South African sign language interpreter Francois Deysel tweeted: ""Please can someone ask the interpreter to step down from stage, it is embarrassing and making a mockery of our profession."" DeafSA said the man also did not use the established, recognized signs for Mandela, South African President Jacob Zuma or his predecessor, Thabo Mbeki, among others. ""This proves that he is not involved in the deaf community and doesn't know South African Sign Language,"" it said. ""To the best of our knowledge, he has not undergone any formal training in South African Sign Language or Interpreting offered by any recognized institution which offers these training courses."" As outrage over his interpretation skills grew, so did questions over who he was and who hired him. A spokesman for the ruling African National Congress said the party had not hired him for the event. ""We have used him on some occasions but yesterday was not an ANC event so we cannot answer for yesterday,"" spokesman Jackson Mthembu said.

"Police in eastern Canada announced Friday they ""are reopening the investigation involving Rehtaeh Parsons,"" the 17-year-old who tried to kill herself after she was allegedly gang-raped and bullied. Rehtaeh, a high school student from Halifax, Nova Scotia, was taken off life support Sunday, three days after she attempted to hang herself. The HRM Partners in Policing -- which includes Halifax Regional Police and a locally based division of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police -- said in a statement Friday it was reviewing the case ""in light of new and credible information that has recently been brought forward to police."" The alleged sexual assault happened in November 2011 when Rehtaeh was 15, her family said. Police investigated, but no criminal charges were filed. Authorities confirmed that a photograph allegedly showing Rehtaeh having sex with one of the boys was circulated to friends' mobile phones and computers. As a result, her family said, she developed suicidal thoughts. Rehtaeh also struggled emotionally after the police investigation, her mother wrote on her Facebook tribute page. When evidence goes viral . ""Rehtaeh is gone today because of the four boys that thought that raping a 15-year-old girl was OK and to distribute a photo to ruin her spirit and reputation would be fun,"" her mother wrote.

Her family told CNN they met with Canadian justice officials Wednesday and urged them to reconsider filing charges. The officials, they said, assured them they would take a fresh look after a police investigation ended without criminal charges.

"Like many people, I use Facebook to keep up with friends about all kinds of things -- deaths, births, the latest fads, jokes. So I was disturbed to learn about an article, ""Experimental Evidence of massive-scale emotional contagion through social networks"" published last week in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Science (PNAS). Facebook had subjected nearly 700,000 users in an experiment without their knowledge, manipulating these individuals' news feeds, reducing positive or negative content, and examining the emotions of these individuals' subsequent posts. Facebook essentially sought to manipulate people's mood. This is not a trivial undertaking.  What if a depressed person became more depressed?   Facebook says that the effect wasn't large, but it was large enough for the authors to publish the study in a major science journal. This experiment is scandalous and violates accepted research ethics. In 1974, following revelations of ethical violations in the Tuskegee Syphilis study, Congress passed the National Research Act.  At Tuskegee, researchers followed African-American men with syphilis for decades and did not tell the subjects when penicillin became available as an effective treatment.  The researchers feared that the subjects, if informed, would take the drug and be cured, ending the experiment. Public outcry led to federal regulations governing research on humans, requiring informed consent.   These rules pertain, by law, to all studies conducted using federal funds, but have been extended by essentially all universities and pharmaceutical and biotech companies in this country to cover all research on humans, becoming the universally-accepted standard. According to these regulations, all research must respect the rights of individual research subjects, and scientific investigators must therefore explain to participants the purposes of the study, describe the procedures (and which of these are experimental) and ""any reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts."" Facebook followed none of these mandates.  The company has argued that the study was permissible because the website's data use policy states, ""we may use the information we receive about you...for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research and service improvement,"" and that ""we may make friend suggestions, pick stories for your News Feed or suggest people to tag in photos."" But while the company is not legally required to follow this law, two of the study's three authors are affiliated with universities -- Cornell and the University of California at San Francisco -- that publicly uphold this standard. The National Research Act led to the establishment of local research ethics committees, known as Institutional Review Boards (or IRBs), which can waive the informed consent requirement in certain instances, provided, ""whenever appropriate, the subjects will be provided with additional pertinent information after participation"" -- that is, researchers should ""debrief"" the participants afterwards. Such a debriefing apparently did not occur here, but easily could have. Facebook said it reviewed the research internally, but there is no evidence that that review was by an IRB or met the standards of the federal regulations. Moreover, the journal, PNAS, mandates that ""all experiments have been conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki,"" which also dictates that subjects be informed of the study's ""aims, methods...and the discomfort it may entail."" The lead author, Adam Kramer, apologized on Facebook, writing, ""my coauthors and I are very sorry for the way the paper described the research and any anxiety it caused.""  But that statement falls far short. The problem is not only how the study was described, but how it was conducted. Many researchers try to avoid having to obtain appropriate informed consent, since they worry that potential subjects, if asked, would refuse to participate. Pharmaceutical, insurance and Internet companies and others are increasingly studying us, acquiring massive amounts of data about us -- about not only our Internet use, but our genomes and medical records.  Many medical centers are building enormous biobanks.  Countless websites now examine our behavior online.  They ask us to scroll down and click ""I accept,"" assuming we're unlikely to read the dense legalese and simply accept their terms. In July 2011, President Obama released proposals to improve the current system of oversight on human research.  The federal Office of Human Research Protections received public comments for a few months but appears to have put this on the back burner. Social scientists have complained that the current regulations are onerous and that their research should be excused from IRB review. The current system is overly bureaucratic and needs reform. But as this controversial Facebook experiment suggests, it should not be scrapped. Good experiments benefit society. But in their zeal to conduct research, some social scientists overlook how their studies may impinge on people's rights. As the amount of research on humans continues to grow, more violations will probably occur. We should try to avoid as much as possible becoming human guinea pigs.","Facebook conducted a study on nearly 700,000 users by manipulating their news feeds .

"On the day the new Ebola clinic in Liberia opened, ambulances waited outside. Inside the ambulances were desperately ill patients who had come for treatment but instead would be left to lie on the ground as others walked by. The Island Clinic and its 120 Ebola treatment beds opened to fanfare Sunday afternoon, with a ceremony attended by international health officials and Liberian leaders. But the clinic, located on Bushrod Island near Monrovia, the capital, did not appear to be ready for the number of patients that quickly flooded its doors. Some lay motionless on the floors of the ambulances outside the center, too weak to get out. They had traveled for hours after being turned away from other hospitals in the area. No one from inside the hospital arrived to offer assistance. One man opened his eyes weakly. ""Try to come down and walk a little,"" a worker told him. ""I'm too tired,"" the man said. But he summoned his strength and got out of the ambulance -- and immediately collapsed on the ground. A little boy tried to walk out of another ambulance, but he too collapsed. The two lay on the rocky ground just a few feet apart. The boy was completely naked and the man was naked from the waist down -- Ebola patients often don't wear pants because of the intense diarrhea caused by the virus. ""Get up and go inside,"" workers told the boy. ""You'll only get food if you go inside."" ""Let him rest,"" another worker said, and they agreed to let him stay where he lay. When asked why no one from the hospital was helping them get inside, a hospital worker said staff was inside suiting up in protective gear. Ebola spreads through contact with bodily fluids from an infected patient. More than 2,800 people have died over the past six months in West Africa. Five countries have reported Ebola cases, but Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone have carried the largest burden. Deadliest outbreak: What you need to know . Island Clinic is supported by the government of Liberia and the World Health Organization. When shown CNN's video of the patients collapsing, a WHO representative was horrified, but said the patients shouldn't have waited until they were so sick to seek help. ""I think the lesson here is that people come too late,"" said Peter Graaff. But many Ebola patients don't wait by choice -- there's an estimated shortage of 700 Ebola beds in Monrovia alone, and patients often wander from hospital to hospital, only to be turned away. ""I know, I know,"" said Graaff, WHO's country representative in Liberia. ""That's why we need to increase capacity."" Graaff said he would try to find out why hospital workers didn't come help the patients. He said he hopes any opening-day difficulties won't discourage patients from seeking help -- he doesn't want them to stay home. ""It's shocking,"" he said. ""This is exactly what we should try to avoid in the future. It's horrible.""","Island Clinic near Monrovia, Liberia, offers 120 new Ebola treatment beds .

"The Department of Justice announced on Thursday it has reached an agreement with the city of Albuquerque, New Mexico, to address a ""pattern or practice of excessive force"" by the problem-plagued Albuquerque Police Department. The DOJ said the city has agreed to allow an independent monitor and the courts to oversee reforms at the police department, along with community input and involvement. According to a joint statement, the department and the city plan to implement reform in eight areas of concern:  ""use of force policies, interactions with individuals with mental illness and other disabilities, tactical units, training, internal investigations and civilian complaints, management and supervision, recruitment and selection of officers, and community engagement and oversight."" ""This agreement marks an important step forward in addressing the unreasonable use of deadly force uncovered in our investigation into the Albuquerque Police Department,"" Attorney General Eric Holder said Thursday. The Justice Department concluded in a report released in April that Albuquerque Police had a history of  brutality and unnecessary deadly force. ""The pattern and practice is the result of serious systemic deficiencies in policy, training, supervision and accountability. The police department's failure to ensure that officers respect the Constitution undermines public trust,"" the DOJ said in the report. ""I am confident that the Albuquerque Police Department will be able to correct troubling practices, restore public trust, and better protect its citizens against all threats and dangers -- while providing the model of professionalism and fairness that all Americans deserve,"" Holder said. The reforms will include input from the community and the police department.

"Tears streamed down 12-year-old Marcus Allen's face in 2009, as he recalled how members of a private suburban Philadelphia swim club had hurled racial slurs and worried aloud if he and other mostly minority day campers might steal from them. Today, Marcus is just about to turn 15 and hit the gridiron as a running back on his high school football team. He has grown up in more ways than one -- including having experienced discrimination firsthand and seen the U.S. justice system in action, its pursuit of justice driven in large part by his and other adolescents' accounts of what they had seen and heard that summer. ""I'm glad that people saw and felt what I felt,"" Marcus, who is black, told CNN. The U.S. Justice Department announced Thursday that it and the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission reached a settlement with the now-defunct Valley Club of Huntingdon Valley, two and a half years after filing a lawsuit against the club. Under terms of the deal, the club -- which filed for bankruptcy in November 2009 a few months after the incident and had its property sold for $1.46 million the following June -- agreed to payouts to more than 50 children like Marcus who were part of the Creative Steps Day Care Center, their counselors and Creative Steps. The distributed money includes whatever ""remaining assets"" from the club's property sale are left over, with $65,000 set aside to create a diversity council made up of former Valley Club members, Creative Steps counselors, campers and their families to promote community healing, the U.S. Justice Department said. Marcus' mother, Aletha Wright, who owns Creative Steps, told CNN on Friday that her son grew up in a white neighborhood and goes to school with mostly white students. In his first 12 years, she said her son hadn't had any problems. ""This was a culture shock for him, because Marcus didn't know racism existed,"" Wright said. The day care center based out of northeast Philadelphia had paid the Valley Club $1,950 in June of 2009 so its camp children could access its pool over the summer. But when young day campers came to the predominantly white club for the first time on June 29, ""the children reported hearing racial slurs,"" the Justice Department said. On July 3, 2009, ""the club refunded the day camp's membership fee and prohibited the children from returning to swim"" according to the federal agency -- a decision the Valley Club contended then was not due to the campers' race but because ""we underestimated the capacity of our facilities."" Marcus, who was then 12, told CNN soon after the incident that he'd heard some club members say, ""What are these black kids here? They might steal from us."" ""It's kind of sad that people still thinking like this,"" the tearful boy said. ""I thought those days were over."" Three years later, his mother said she feels that interview had an impact ""because (viewers) saw a child. They didn't see an African-American child. They saw a child -- before the world -- being discriminated, and he innocently just wanted to take a swim."" The recently announced settlement could net each camper between $15,000 and $30,000, depending on their involvement in the incident, according to lawyers. Many of them plan to use the money to help pay for college, the day camp's civil attorney Brian Mildenberg said. But not Marcus, who said he has other plans. ""I want to open my own business and do something like Steve Jobs did,"" the teenager said. Wright, his mother, calls the settlement ""bittersweet,"" though she does feel ""justice was served."" Another civil lawyer involved in the case, Gabriel Levin, said he believes the young campers involved get more than money from the case. ""It's a great life lesson for these kids,"" Levin said. ""They experienced something terrible and justice prevailed.""","A boy recalls hearing a mostly white club's members talking about day campers .

"Compared with the Japanese kimono and Chinese cheongsam, Korea's traditional dress -- known as hanbok, and worn by women and men -- has remained under the international fashion radar. So much so that when Lee Young Hee, among South Korea's most renowned hanbok designers, showed her collection in Paris for the first time in 1993, most of the fashion press alluded to her silhouettes as ""kimonos"" -- to the horror of both the designer herself and everyone back in Seoul. It's only relatively recently that hanbok has been gaining widespread attention, with top foreign designers looking to hanbok for inspiration in the past few years. Dior and Carolina Herrera both had heavily hanbok-influenced designs in their 2011 spring collections. Giorgio Armani and Miuccia Prada are also fans, with the latter often stopping by Lee Young Hee's hanbok atelier in Seoul for fabric and design inspiration when she's in town. Made to wear . For hanbok, the concept of off-the-rack doesn't really exist. Every hanbok is customized to fit the wearer's body. Women's hanbok consists of only two primary pieces. The chima is a full, high skirt, made even fuller with a mujigi (petticoat). The jeogori is a long-sleeved top with two goreum (long ties). Nevertheless, hanbok is a complicated garment. There's also the binyeo (traditional headpiece) and embroidered footwear. Men's hanbok is simpler. Variation tends to be limited to the overcoat, while the jeogori and pants stay fairly uniform. Men also have a headpiece -- the gat is a traditional hat. Men can also add a jjoki (vest). From the first visit for an initial fitting, the total production time usually ranges from one to three weeks, with more intricate hanbok taking longer. Color as design . Rather than embroidery, which was reserved for royal wear, color is the most important element. ""Hanbok is all about color,"" says Lee Young Hee. ""The color is the design. It's not about what's stuck on it. ""And we need to know where they're going, and for what occasion they're wearing it. Our clothes are more difficult to wear than Western clothing."" Lee uses natural dyes for her hanbok to create beautiful, traditional colors, even though, as a pioneer of modern hanbok design, her hanbok can also be unconventional, as her ""wind dresses"" in the gallery above. Other designers tend to stick closer to the original design. ""I am a fan of the traditional silhouette, which is what I stick to,"" says designer Lee Il Soon, whose celebrated store Kumdanje celebrates its 20th anniversary this year. Lee Il Soon, who showed a small fashion show of hanbok in New York this August, is passionate about bringing the Korean silhouette to overseas audiences. Her wedding line of white hanbok (unusual in modern times) is a nod to the 1870s, when Western influences came to Korean clothing for the first time and brides modified their hanbok in the Western bridal style, wearing them with veils and lace. Significance of color . These days, Koreans themselves tend to break out the hanbok only for special occasions such as weddings, funerals, first birthdays and major family gatherings. While in the past, hanbok colors carried important implications, such as class, these days the choice of color is more about what suits the wearer and the wearer's situation the best, rather than reflecting status. Still, some rules apply. Although both Britney Spears and Paris Hilton brought international attention to hanbok during their trips to Korea by wearing pink hanbok, they actually committed fashion faux pas in doing so -- pink is rarely worn beyond childhood, with the exception of perhaps engagement ceremonies. ""Natural dyes are the most beautiful,"" says Lee. ""The colors come out more subdued and the natural dyes can also be used to go darker to make a point. ""Our ancestors truly made hanbok as works of art. The colors are most beautiful when natural."" According to the design team at Kumdanje, lighter, pastel colors are best suited for warmer months, while deeper colors are more popular during colder months. Special dress . ""The designer has to propose the design to the customer, so it's best to talk to the designer a lot,"" says Kim Young Jin, director of Tchai Kim Young Jin boutique, who designs contemporary (gaeryang) rather than traditional (jeontong) hanbok. ""What I hear from my [Korean] customers is that there's nowhere to wear hanbok,"" says Kim. ""But I don't think there's a need for us to think of hanbok as everyday wear, because we already have everyday clothes that we're used to, and instead Koreans should think of them as outfits for special occasions."" In recent years, there's been more of a foreign demand for the Korean traditional dress. According to the staff at Maison de Lee Young Hee, more than 30% of their customers are foreign, ranging from foreign brides of Korean grooms to fashion designers and artists to tourists looking for interesting souvenirs of their trip to Korea. Where to buy . The finest custom-made hanbok can be found at the following shops. Prices start around ₩1,200,000 ($1,100). Kumdanje, 665-1 Sinsa-dong Gangnam-gu, Seoul; +82 2 517 7243 .

"(CNN) -- Shortly before the midterm election, I wrote a strategy memo outlining how core Democratic voters were not yet energized and well-positioned to vote. It shouldn't have been much of a bombshell. It simply outlined what everyone already knew: Low turnout would equal disaster for Democrats. Later I wrote a commentary for CNN.com outlining the enormous differential in likely turnout between Democratic and Republican precincts. For certain, the Achilles' heel for Democrats was a broad and deep drop-off of its inveterate voters. When the electorate shrinks, Democrats lose. To succeed, Democrats must always be expanding the electorate and using every tool in their arsenal to do so. This brings me to how I was wrong on Election Night. I was wrong to go along with conventional wisdom about how the election was all about rejecting Obama, and that it would be wise not to make him a focal point. According to exit polls, most voters in fact rejected the idea that their vote was in opposition to Obama. A 45% plurality said Obama had not been a factor in their vote; 53% of independent voters and a larger majority (55%) of moderate voters said Obama was not a factor in their vote. Obama was very much a factor for Republicans. But for the broad swath of voters outside of hard partisans, this election wasn't about him. But for Democrats, it should have been. Here is why: According to projections by the United States Election Project, turnout in the 2014 midterm elections was the lowest in over six decades, a pathetic 36%. Guess which political leader is really good at energizing turnout and expanding the electorate? In 2008, candidate Obama helped increase turnout to an astonishing 62%, helping Democrats win seats up and down the ballot in both red and blue states. In 2012, he did it again, with close to 60% turnout -- once more winning a majority on his way to winning back-to-back majorities, which hasn't been done by a Democrat in my lifetime. He helped Democrats pick up Congressional seats even in a year many prognosticators said Democrats would lose the Senate. No, President Obama shouldn't have been put on a bus tour through the Deep South, but he certainly should not have been locked away in the White House either. There hasn't been a better campaigner in either party in over three decades than Barack Obama. When he is on the campaign trail, he can bring stadiums full of voters to their feet, as if at a BeyoncÃ© concert. This midterm, Democrats basically told the best campaigner in our history to go sit in a corner. It wasn't the right map. They essentially told Michael Jordan not to suit up for game seven because the game was being played in a hostile arena. And why did we do that? Because we didn't have the fortitude to stand with him and the accomplishments we should have trumpeted: lower unemployment, declining crime, economic growth that is the envy of the European Union, manufacturing growth, a booming auto industry, low gas prices, a record number of people with health insurance, the deficit shrinking as a proportion of GDP, and Osama bin Laden dead. Hell, with a lot less, President Reagan declared it was ""morning in America."" ""Yeah,"" you tell me, ""but Americans don't feel the economy is getting better."" Well, you know how NOT to change that narrative -- by running from our accomplishments. The painful truth is, we ran away from the best progressive persuasion voice in our times because the ghost of our country's original sin still haunts us. We looked at that battleground map running through the heart of Dixie and trembled. We ran away from Obama instead of fighting, instead of calling to the better angels of the American electorate. We tried to parse our party's identity, which only reinforced the tribalization of our electorate. So we called ourselves ""Clinton Democrats."" Pitiful. We all know what that means. It only validates the putrid, subtle racism that it is attempting to perfume. Note to future Democratic campaigns: There are no Clinton Democrats, there are only Democrats.","Cornell Belcher: Obama should have spent more time on campaign trail .

"Citing cost concerns, the Obama administration said Friday it has halted a long-term care insurance program that was part of the massive health care law passed in 2010. Called the CLASS Act (Community Living Assistance Services and Supports), the program was canceled by Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius after a 19-month effort to find a way to make it financially viable. In a letter to Congress, Sebelius wrote, ""Despite our best analytical efforts, I do not see a viable path forward for CLASS implementation at this time."" The CLASS program was similar to long-term care plans available in the private sector in which workers sign up and pay a monthly premium. It was voluntary and was to be paid for entirely by the premiums from those who signed up. In return, subscribers would get a daily benefit. But a senior administration official told CNN that there were big questions whether CLASS could be self-sustaining even when the health care reform law was being considered by Congress. And as a result, lawmakers specified that the HHS secretary had to determine that the program would be sustainable for 75 years before certifying it. The legislation had been championed by the late Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Massachusetts. In a blog entry on Healthcare.gov, Sebelius cited warnings that not enough young healthy people would sign up. ""This could have led to a vicious cycle where premiums would have to be set higher and higher to cover the likely costs of benefits, leading fewer and fewer healthier people to sign up for the program,"" she wrote. Sebelius said she wasn't giving up. ""So even as we suspend work on implementing CLASS, we are recommitting ourselves to the ultimate goal of making sure Americans can get the long-term care they need, whether it's a working-age mom with disabilities who needs daily support right now or a young man at his first job who wants to protect himself and his family against the possibility of huge long-term care costs in the future,"" Sebelius wrote. Congressional Republicans had long targeted the program as part of their effort to repeal President Barack Obama's health care reform law. Responding to the Sebelius decision, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement,  ""The Obama administration today acknowledged what they refused to admit when they passed their partisan health bill: the CLASS Act was a budget gimmick that might enhance the numbers on a Washington bureaucrat's spreadsheet but was destined to fail in the real world."" McConnell said the CLASS Act ""is only one of the unwise, unsustainable components of an unwise, unsustainable law."" ""We should repeal the CLASS Act and the rest of the health spending law and replace it with the type of common-sense reforms that lower costs and Americans support,"" McConnell said.","Obama administration drops long-term insurance program .

"(CNN)They're not rich and famous -- they're just regular people -- but that didn't stop them from being extraordinary. The following five people transformed into heroes in 2013 after they made some selfless and inspirational split-second decisions. Meet them Thursday during an hour-long special airing at 10 p.m. ET on CNN. Anderson Cooper and HLN's Robin Meade will ask these extraordinary people what motivated them to take action when they were thrust in the middle of some of this year's biggest stories: . LaDonna Cobb . She put herself in harm's way to save students during tornado. The teacher's assistant had taken off work on the afternoon of May 20, 2013, to close on a new home with her husband. But that would have to wait. The couple found themselves rushing back to Briarwood Elementary in Moore, Oklahoma, to pick up their three daughters because a tornado alert had been issued for the area. LaDonna knew she had to stay and help, even though her husband begged her to leave. She physically positioned herself over the kids as the tornado tore apart the school. ""(Safety) doesn't really cross my mind,"" LaDonna said. ""At that point, I just wanted to put whatever I could between whatever was going to happen and those babies."" Zach Sobiech . He used music to find peace and purpose during his suffering. Zach Sobiech may have lost his battle with cancer last May, but his music and his message of hope continue to make an impact in the world today. Sobiech wrote a beautiful song called ""Clouds"" that went viral this year and topped the charts. All proceeds from the song's sale go to a fund that supports cancer research, which Sobiech created before he died. ""Joy and suffering can go hand in hand,"" said Zach's mom, Laura Sobiech. ""He chose to be happy. He chose that and he fought for it every day."" Antoinette Tuff . She managed to calm -- and disarm -- a gunman. The school bookkeeper found herself face to face with an AK-47 on August 20, 2013. A locked security door should have kept suspect Michael Brandon Hill out of Ronald McNair Discovery Center in suburban Atlanta, Georgia. But the 20-year-old reportedly made his way into the school by following a parent through the front door. Tuff said she was meant to be in the front office with Hill that day and that she was armed with her own weapon -- faith. She used her past experiences to connect with the troubled man and worked as a mediator between him and police. ""I was terrified on the inside but I know that if I kept him there with me, there's a likelihood no one would get hurt,"" Tuff said. Carlos Arredondo . He saved a gravely wounded victim of the Boston bombing. He didn't know it at the time, but Carlos Arredondo would end up helping save a man who would go on to identify one of the suspects in the Boston Marathon bombing. Arredondo, once a volunteer firefighter in Costa Rica, was at the race's finish line, passing out American flags and advocating for the needs of military vets and suicide prevention. When he heard the second blast go off on April 15, 2013, Arredondo rushed toward the chaos to offer his help. He fashioned a tourniquet for a man named Jeff Bauman, who had lost both of his legs. Arredondo also rushed Bauman to an ambulance in a wheelchair. ""He does a lot of simple acts of kindness whenever the opportunity presents itself,"" said Arredondo's wife, Mélida. ""It's his nature."" Sergio Consuegra . He calmed the chaos of a pack of angry bikers. A badly beaten SUV driver had just come face to face with an angry pack of bikers when Consuegra decided to step in between them. The bikers had swarmed the SUV once before, right after the driver bumped into one of them. The driver, who had his family in tow, sped away from that escalating scene and plowed over another biker, who was critically injured. When the SUV later came to a stop, the situation descended into chaos. Consuegra, a father of 10 who was on his way to church, managed to diffuse tensions, risking his own life to save others. ""I felt like God wanted me to be there that day,"" said Consuegra.","An hour-long CNN special looks at five extraordinary people .

"Fifteenth-century Arabs were the first to cultivate coffee and a Frenchman was behind the 1843 debut of the world's first commercial espresso machine. There have been a few leaps forward since then. ""People are more and more interested in where the beans come from, and how they're harvested and roasted,"" says New Zealand barista champion Nick Clark of Wellington's Flight Coffee. ""There are so many variables involved in producing a great cup of coffee these days, and the industry has had to evolve to meet growing consumer expectations."" The world's best coffee cities are those where the coffee isn't just good -- it's great. Have you got a favorite coffee city? Top coffee shop? Share your coffee love in the comments below. London . Aussies and Kiwis opened the city's first espresso-focused coffee shops (such as Flat White and Kaffeine) a decade ago and they've been popping up across the city ever since. ""London still has a long way to go with café service, but in the past five years there's been so much growth, which is a great thing to be part of,"" says Estelle Bright, head barista at London's Caravan. Local order: Flat white or cappuccino. ""London is still in the grip of the flat white craze, but cappuccinos are similarly popular,"" says Bright. Top shops: East London boasts the highest concentration of quality coffee shops and cafes. Allpress, Climpson & Sons and Caravan are standouts. Melbourne . ""The coffee culture in Melbourne is just incredible,"" says reigning World Barista Champion Pete Licata, from the United States. Coffee is such an integral part of the Melbourne lifestyle that the city even hosts an annual coffee expo. Local order: Piccolo latte. While lattes, cappuccinos and flat whites remain popular, piccolo lattes (made with less milk so the espresso tastes stronger) are the drink du jour. Top shops: ""It's nearly impossible to find a bad cup of coffee in Melbourne,"" says Licata. For real coffee purists, there's Axil Coffeehouse Roasters in Hawthorn (322 Burwood Road), Auction Rooms in North Melbourne and Dead Man Espresso in South Melbourne. Hidden Secrets Tours runs café culture walks. Reykjavik, Iceland . After the Dutch, Scandinavians have the highest coffee consumption per capita in the world. While Finns drink the most among Scandinavians, Icelanders are also coffee crazy. ""Not too long ago, cafés in Reykjavík were more about the food,"" says Kristin Thora, a barista at Icelandic institution Kaffitar and reigning National Cupping Champion. ""You'd have coffee and cake and didn't mind how the coffee was as long as the cake was good. ""Then, about 25 years ago, people started to care about how their coffee was served."" With Iceland's lack of commercial coffee behemoths, smaller businesses have had a chance to flourish. Now you can hardly walk a city block without passing a coffee shop. Local order: Latte or cappuccino. ""Drip coffee is popular in the home, but Icelanders tend go to coffeehouses for espresso-based drinks,"" says Thora. Top shops: With seven coffee shops and a roaster to its name, Kaffitar is the closest thing Iceland has to a coffee chain. Stofan and Kaffismidja are hipster faves. Rome . Coffee is so much a part of Italian culture that you'll rarely encounter a local who doesn't drink it. But believe it or not, it's not always that easy to find a decent espresso in Italy, with critics whispering that Italians have been resistant to adopt modern barista techniques. But with the best of the nation's baristas calling it home, Rome is your best bet for a quality cup. Local order: Espresso. Custom dictates that milky coffees can only be consumed at breakfast, anyway. Top shops: Rosati in Piazza del Popolo, Sant' Eustachi by the Pantheon or Giolitti, a few blocks west of the Trevi Fountain, are crowd favorites. Singapore . ""Coffee has always been an integral part of Singaporean life, but we've only recently embraced modern espresso technology,"" says Jovena Loon of Café Hopping Singapore. ""Locals have become so obsessed with latte art that it has become a basic criteria for a good café."" Local order: Latte, mocha or cappuccino. Top shops: Jovena recommends Strangers' Reunion in Chinatown, Dutch Colony in Pasar Bella marketplace, and Bukit Timah and Chye Seng Huat Hardware in Little India. Seattle . If there's one American city that's consistently ahead of the game, it's Seattle. The green mermaid is only a small part of the hometown coffee scene. ""Coffee is our liquid sunshine in Seattle,"" says Joshua Boyt from Victrola Coffee Roasters, one of the city's best cafes for coffee geeks. ""Passion for the product, coupled with the sheer number of coffee shops across the city, has created a culture of constant improvement through competition and camaraderie."" Local order: Espresso, cappuccino or a single-origin pour. Top shops: Victrola Coffee Roasters in Capitol Hill, Empire Espresso in Columbia City and Seattle Coffee Works downtown are all solid picks. Vienna, Austria . They're such an important part of Viennese culture that the city's coffee houses were listed by UNESCO in 2011 as an Intangible Heritage. But modern coffee connoisseurs such as Vienna coffee blogger Lameen Abdul-Malik of From Coffee With Love admit that the standard of coffee in these beloved institutions, which act as public living rooms where people come to chat, read newspapers and eat strudel, are lagging in terms of coffee technology and service expectations. Perhaps not for long. ""Since Vienna hosted the World Barista Championships in 2012, and new-style independent coffee shops began to open up, the quality of espresso drinks is steadily improving,"" says Abdul-Malik. Local order: Espresso or cappuccino in a new style cafe. Or a Vienner melange (similar to a cappuccino, but usually topped with cream) in a traditional coffeehouse. Top shops: Abdul-Maliuk recommends Caffe Couture, Essenti or Coffee Pirates. Demel serves traditional coffee and marvelous cakes. Wellington, New Zealand . While the ubiquitous flat white was purportedly invented in Sydney, the drink was perfected in Wellington, where it's become the nation's unofficial national beverage. ""Wellington-ites really know their coffee, and there is a very high standard being served around the city,"" says Clark. ""Wellington is also a small city; there's a lot of interaction between consumers and professionals, which helps our industry to improve and grow."" Local order: Flat white. It's a religion. Top shops: It's tough to find a bad coffee in New Zealand. Some of Wellington's best coffee shops include Flight Coffee Hangar, Memphis Belle and Lamason Brew Bar.

"The mother of an Omaha toddler is defending her son after he unleashed a slew of obscenities in an online video that has gone viral. In the video, the diapered boy is taunted and cursed at by adults, who coax him into using crude words. The African-American toddler knocks down a chair and responds to some of the comments with a middle-finger salute. ""Shut up, bitch,"" he says in one of the responses. The adults chuckle, prompting him to unleash more obscenities at them. Despite the video, he's not an anomaly, according to his mother. ""He had a clean diaper, the house was clean and like they said, kids curse, every kid does it,"" the mother told CNN affiliate KETV in an exclusive interview. CNN does not identify juveniles in such stories. The mother is 16. ""He's a smart little boy. All that cussing that he did, he doesn't do that,"" she said. ""Somebody told him to do that. My son doesn't do that. I don't allow it."" She said a friend of her brother filmed the video while she was in another room. ""He was wrong for doing that ... posting the video up and getting us into this situation,"" she said. ""Everybody that thinks I'm a bad mother, I'm not. I'm a good mother to my son. I teach him a lot. He's very smart."" The  police union in Omaha, Nebraska, posted the clip on its website to highlight what it called the ""cycle of violence and thuggery"" the community faces. The Omaha Police Officers' Association is under fire from the city's police chief, the ACLU and at least one community leader. They say the move needlessly antagonizes minority communities, which make up about a quarter of Omaha's 409,000 residents. Sgt. John Wells, the union's president, said the video was ""disturbing"" and ""offensive."" ""The focus here isn't on any particular ethnic group. The focus here is on the troubling behavior toward this child,"" Wells said. ""This behavior is going to potentially lead this child down a path that is completely unhealthy."" On the website where the video is posted, the union said the clip came from ""a local thug's public Facebook page."" ""We here at OmahaPOA.com viewed the video and we knew that despite the fact that it is sickening, heartbreaking footage, we have an obligation to share it to continue to educate the law abiding public about the terrible cycle of violence and thuggery that some young innocent children find themselves helplessly trapped in,"" the police union wrote in a post accompanying the video. ""Now while we didn't see anything in this video that is blatantly 'illegal,' we sure did see a lot that is flat out immoral and completely unhealthy for this little child from a healthy upbringing standpoint,"" it added. Wells said one of the adults mentions a local street gang in the video. ""That is why when we talk about the culture, the criminal culture, that this is to try to break the cycle and deal with the culture of violence and the culture of gang activity,"" he said. Willie Hamilton, president of the community activist group Black Men United, said the union crossed a line. ""For them to take a video out of context -- a 2-year-old who doesn't have the brain capacity to know what's going on --  and to say that this child, because two adults acted inappropriately, is going to end up in a life of crime is totally inappropriate,"" Hamilton said. The American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska, which filed an excessive force suit against the Omaha Police Department on behalf of an African-American family Monday, said the union's use of ""racially charged language"" was ""very disconcerting."" ""Officers should be working to build a culture where anyone feels comfortable calling law enforcement,"" ACLU of Nebraska Executive Director Becki Brenner said in a prepared statement. ""The manner in which the Officers Association has discussed this incident has done nothing but further erode community trust and reinforce the need for independent oversight, trainings, and other reforms."" Police Chief Todd Schmaderer tried to distance his agency from the controversy Tuesday, saying that the union's website and Facebook page are separate from those of the Omaha Police Department. He said he has little authority over the public statements of union members. ""With that background and understanding, I want to make it explicit and clear that the views expressed on the OPOA Facebook page do not necessarily reflect the official stance of the Omaha Police Department,"" Schmaderer said. ""I strongly disagree with any postings that may cause a divide in our community or an obstacle to police community relations."" Wells said union members have turned the video over to the department's child victim unit. The child and his mother are in protective custody for safety reasons. Court records obtained by the affiliate show the toddler was among five injured in October when shots were fired at a home. The boy and his mother have been relocated by the state in the past over gang activity fears, according to the affiliate.","Video shows toddler bombarded with obscenities, coaxed to respond in kind .

"It was 3 a.m. in Thailand. Presumably barely anyone was watching. But the country's military chief chose that hour to appear on army-run Channel 5 television Tuesday to declare martial law across the country. ""This is not a coup,"" said Gen. Prayuth Chan-Ocha, hours before the nation's people woke to the new public order; with soldiers stationed at intersections and tanks on the streets. The army says it has taken control to ensure law and order in a country split by deep political divisions, two weeks after the country's Constitutional Court removed caretaker Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra from government. ""The defendant has abused her position as prime minister,"" said the judge in the ruling. ""Her prime ministership has ... ended."" Nine cabinet ministers were also removed from office, while Deputy PM and Commerce Minister Niwatthamrong Boonsongpaisan was appointed caretaker prime minister. How has the caretaker prime minister reacted? Niwatthamrong has not been removed from his post, although one of his aides, who declined to be named, told CNN the government had not been consulted before the military made its move. ""We have to watch and see if what declared by the Army Chief is well honored,"" he said, calling the events of Tuesday morning ""a half coup d'etat."" Niwatthamrong later issued a statement on the imposition of martial law: . ""With reference to the Royal Thai Army's declaration of the martial law to preserve order and bring back peacefulness to the country, the government wishes the same for national peace, and hopes that the martial law is imposed by way of peaceful means and equality with no violence and discrimination and under the legal state and the rule of law which is in accordance with the government's ongoing policy,"" he said. ""This action of the Royal Thai Army's must be under the principles of constitution and democracy with the King as head of state."" A long history of coups . The people of Thailand are all too familiar with coup d'etats. There have been at least 18 actual and attempted military takeovers since Thailand became a constitutional monarchy in 1932. The last one was in 2006 when the military sent tanks onto the streets before ousting then Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, the brother of Yingluck, who is now living in exile to avoid a corruption conviction he claims is politically motivated. Thaksin's supporters, known as red shirts, have also rallied around Yingluck, slamming her ousting as a ""judicial coup.""  Thousands of protesters swarmed the streets following the ruling, seeking the removal of the caretaker government. Their political rivals allege Yingluck is acting as a puppet leader for her brother and campaigned for her removal. The anti-government movement includes ""yellow shirts,"" predominantly urban, middle class members of the royalist establishment. Members of the ""red shirts"" are typically rural working class. What does martial law look like in Thailand? Within hours of declaring martial law, Gen. Prayuth announced he would be leading a new security task force, the Peace Keeping Command Center (PKCC). The task force's advisory committee also includes chiefs of the navy, air force and national police, he said. Soldiers were dispatched to stand guard at television stations. Broadcasters, including 10 satellite TV stations, were ordered to shut down ""to ensure that information will be distributed rightly and to prevent any distortions which could lead to misunderstandings and it could lead to wide spread conflicts."" Images posted on social media showed soldiers patrolling the streets of Bangkok. Paul Quaglia, director at PQA Associates told CNN they were positioned at intersections but so far there was no sign of unrest. ""Traffic is a real mess here at the moment. But there's no violence. I think what the military is trying to do with this 'martial law light,' if I can say that, is to convince protesters to go home. They're trying to dial down the tensions here as well as preempt several large rallies and strikes that were scheduled for later this week,"" he said. Andrew Marshall, a journalist and author who focuses on Thailand, told CNN the military's decision to announce martial law at night indicated it was trying to do so ""with minimal possible fuss."" What happens next? Marshall said it would become clearer in the next couple of days what the army's intentions are; whether it's going to call an election or appoint a new government. ""If they appoint a government it's a coup by another name and you might see the start of violence from the red shirts,"" he said. ""Martial law means the police are sidelined and they are no longer responsible for security. And the police in Thailand are seen as heavily supportive of Thaksin and his allies, which is the red side of the battle. So when you've got a police force that's suddenly been sidelined that's another combustible element in this mix. ""So Thailand is kind of on a knife-edge,"" he said. Did the military have no choice? Gen. Prayuth's move to impose martial law didn't come as a surprise, wrote Saritdet Marukatat, digital editor for the Bangkok Post. The army chief warned last week the military could be forced to act to end violent protests. ""The country was moving towards a possible bloody clash between the two camps, leaving no choice for the army commander but to try to prevent it. As a general, he had only two choices: a military coup or martial law,"" Marukatat wrote. ""He picked the softer option and did as he had promised in last week's statement, that the army does not want a coup because it would meaning tearing down the 2007 constitution."" However, Sunai Phasuk from Human Rights Watch Thailand said the situation in the country had not yet justified the army's intervention. ""There is no concrete proof that the situation in Thailand is out of control to the extent that an enforcement of the martial law is essential. With the enforcement of martial law, the army is one step closer to taking over power completely from civilian administration."" ""At the moment, military authorities have superior power over civil authority in keeping public order. There is no check and balance; there are no safeguards against rights violations; there are no remedies for any damage cause by the army. The fate of the nation is essentially in Gen. Prayuth's hands,"" he said. Could the military broker peace in Thailand? Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political science professor, said the declaration of martial law in Thailand had broken the deadlock between warring parties, and the army was now in a position to mediate a possible resolution. ""We've been paralyzed in Thailand because on one side we have protesters bent on replacing the government, and on the other side we have a caretaker government refusing to resign."" ""If the army can play a mediating role in search of a compromise that satisfies all sides then we can find a way out of this crisis. But if it does not, if the army plays a partisan role, then we can see a lot more crises in Thailand,"" he warned. In a statement, the U.S. State Department encouraged all parties to ""respect democratic principles"" and also stressed the need for elections ""to determine the will of the Thai people.""","Thai military says it's imposition of martial law is not a coup d'etat .

"Good news for air travelers, both domestic and international:  A budget-related furlough of air traffic controllers is over -- and with it, the resulting travel delays. Last week's toll?  More than 40,000 flights delayed and 1,900 others canceled in the United States, according to FlightStats.com. The flight tracking site does not separate furlough-related delays from delays caused by weather or other factors. More than 7,000 flight delays were linked directly to the furloughs last week, according to Federal Aviation Administration figures. Hard hit were U.S. airports with large numbers of international travelers. A flick of the pen . President Barack Obama signed legislation this week to end budget-related FAA air traffic controller furloughs that caused widespread travel delays last week. Although the president didn't officially put pen to paper until Tuesday, the fix went into effect over the weekend.  A typo in the Senate version of the bill delayed the signing. The bill gives the FAA permission to move money from other accounts that allows it to stop furloughing controllers. The FAA issued a statement Saturday saying that it had suspended all employee furloughs and expected normal operations to resume Sunday evening. In rare bipartisan accord, U.S. lawmakers passed the measure Friday, capping a major congressional initiative as the delays snarled airport traffic. Bookkeeping changes . The measure gives the Transportation Department budget planners new flexibility for dealing with forced spending cuts, being allowed to shift money between accounts. It also allows authorities to protect 149 control towers at small- and medium-sized airports that are slated for closure for budgetary reasons. In time for hurricane season: Furloughs in forecast at NOAA . The furloughs affected some 15,000 FAA air traffic controllers. Cost-cutting measures such as the furloughs and the planned closures of towers that are privately run or overseen by federal aviation regulators had become part of the debate on government spending. They have been highlighted by many to illustrate a clear nationwide consequence of the $85 billion in government-wide cuts that took effect in March and may otherwise not be apparent to the public.

"It's been nearly two weeks since Thailand's military took over the country after months of political and social unrest that led to outbursts of violence in Bangkok. But while the political situation is still in flux and no election date set, life in Thailand has resumed to something approaching normality. On Tuesday, the military government announced it was lifting the nation-wide curfew in three tourist hot spots -- Pattaya, Ko Samui and Phuket -- reportedly in response to pressure from the country's ailing tourism industry. All other Thai destinations, including Bangkok, Krabi and Chiang Mai, remain under a daily curfew from midnight-4 a.m. However, air passengers with arrival and departure flights scheduled during the curfew are permitted to travel to and from the airports at any time, and are advised to carry a printout of their flight itinerary. All airports in Thailand remain open and flights are still operating as scheduled. Life in Bangkok . In the Thai capital, streets are calm and most residents are carrying on as normal. The military presence is minimal -- many locals report having not seen a single soldier since the May 22 coup -- though tourists are advised to follow news reports as sporadic demonstrations have taken place in Bangkok in opposition to the coup, which have brought out the military. Since the coup announcement was made on May 22, protest groups on both sides have dismantled their camps and no major incidents of violence have taken place. Tourist attractions, government offices, embassies, shops, bars, restaurants and malls are all open and operating as normal, though some have adjusted their hours in line with the curfew. All Bangkok expressways currently remain open. The city's BTS Skytrain, MRT subway, Suvarnabhumi Airport Rail Link, public ferries and trains continue to operate, while taxis are available 24 hours a day at Bangkok's airports . Television and social media . In the initial days following the coup, all state-run, satellite and cable TV providers were ordered to carry only the signal of the army's television channel but all are now back on the air. Facebook was temporarily shut down last week, leading to fears the junta was cracking down on social media, though the military later denied it had any part in it. Twitter remains one of the best ways to get real-time information on the situation in Thailand. Richard Barrow, a full-time travel blogger based in Bangkok, is a top source for those seeking news about the political situation as well as travel advice. He can be followed at Twitter.com/richardbarrow. Local English-language media on Twitter include the Bangkok Post: Twitter.com/BPbreakingnews; The Nation: Twitter.com/nationnews; and MCOT: Twitter.com/MCOT_Eng. Government warnings . Though from a tourist's point of view Thailand is returning to normal, travelers are advised to check with their governments before visiting as warnings vary and can impact the validity of their travel insurance. According to the National News Bureau of Thailand, a total of 63 countries have issued travel advisories against Thailand, with 19 warning its citizens against visiting the country. Among these is the United States, which issued a travel alert last updated on May 28 that recommends U.S. citizens reconsider their journey to Thailand, particularly Bangkok. ""The Department of State has advised official U.S. government travelers to defer all non-essential travel to Thailand until further notice."" Some countries have since downgraded their warnings in light of the relative calm on the country's streets since the coup, including Italy. Though the UK doesn't advise against visiting, it did issue a warning to citizens about the political situation. ""It is illegal to criticize the coup and you should be wary of making political statements in public,"" says the advisory. ""Some anti-coup demonstrations are taking place in Bangkok and some other cities. These could become violent. You should exercise extreme caution and remain alert to the situation.""

"London Heathrow's gleaming new passenger terminal has opened to its first passengers in a soft launch designed to avoid the glitches that plagued its last major terminal launch. CNN had a preview earlier this year of what its chief architect says is a ""cathedral for the 21st century"" that'll change air travel for good. Terminal 2, otherwise known as the Queen's Terminal, features vaulted ceilings filled with natural light that are designed to guide up to 20 million passengers a year exactly to where they want to be. Disappointingly, it still looks like an airport building anywhere in the world. That's not to say it doesn't have its merits -- as airport buildings go, Queen's Terminal will certainly be among the most pleasant. It'll also help ease some of the air traffic congestion that has left Heathrow struggling to maintain its former status as Europe's chief aviation hub against rivals serving Amsterdam and Frankfurt. The terminal was first showcased when journalists were invited to the unveiling of a gigantic airborne sculpture of twisting metal. 'Cultural capital' The 78-meter aluminum work entitled ""Slipstream"" was created by artist Richard Wilson to fill a wide atrium that passengers will cross when connecting to road and rail networks. Inspired by the turbulence of a tumbling plane, it hangs from a series of pillars and resembles the riveted fuselage of a muscular vintage aircraft -- and a whale. ""It is a statement that says you've arrived in the cultural capital of the world,"" says Wilson. Moving on through the airport, travelers pass through a broad hall filled with rows of security gates and into a huge central atrium that contains the lounge, shopping and dining areas. There's more sculpture here, although on a less impressive scale -- one artwork resembles a tangle of windshield wipers. Overhead, the undulating steel-framed roof is illuminated by glass skylights and LEDs that lead architect Luis Vidal says will change color ""to accommodate the mood of the passenger."" The lounge is bordered on one side by vast windows that look out onto the airport canopy, with most gates within just a few minutes' walk. ""It's a very legible building,"" says Vidal, who describes his Terminal as a ""piazza"" to rival London's Covent Garden that will become a destination in its own right. Soft launch . ""Passengers can understand it very easily,"" says Vidal. ""You can see how far you are from your plane, which makes you more relaxed."" The $4.2 billion building is certainly an improvement on the oppressive low ceilings and cramped quarters of the old Terminal 2, which closed five years ago after more than 50 years of service. It will accommodate 26 airlines, including United, Air Canada, Air New Zealand, Singapore Airlines and others among the global Star Alliance, and connect to more than 50 destinations. ""Nowhere else in the world do you have as many airlines flying to a single airport as you do in London,"" says Mark Schwab, Star Alliance's CEO. Heathrow officials hope by easing the new terminal into operation they will lessen the risk of repeating the chaos that engulfed the 2008 launch of the airport's prestigious Terminal 5. The new terminal arrives amid a campaign, led by London mayor Boris Johnson, to close Heathrow and build a new high-capacity airport in a river estuary on the other side of the city. It's a plan unlikely to derail Heathrow's $18.5 billion long-term plan to remodel the airport along the lines of Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson airport -- the world's busiest. Holland-Kaye said the Terminal 2 would help alleviate some of the current problems, but officials would still pursue a ""politically complex"" campaign to build an environmentally controversial third runway. ""We are ready and able and have private money to deliver the hub airport that Britain needs and deserves,"" he said.","Heathrow's new Terminal 2 opened June 4 and will gear up to handle up to 20 million passengers per year .

"Comments posted to his Twitter account about an ongoing trial have landed an Abu Dhabi man in jail for 10 months, according to a state news agency. Abdulla al-Hadidi's father is one of 94 dissidents facing legal proceedings that began in early March in the United Arab Emirates. Prosecutors accuse the dissidents of trying to overthrow the government and being connected to Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, which is banned in the UAE. But human rights activists say the defendants are government critics and accuse the court of hiding the trial from unbiased international observers and journalists. According to the state news agency WAM, a misdemeanor court ruled that al-Hadidi lied about the proceedings in his writings on social media. ""He published arguments about court proceedings and circumstances surrounding the arrest of the accused with dishonesty and bad faith,"" the agency reported, citing the justice department. Trial on the down-low? But Human Right Watch has said al-Hadidi's treatment at the hands of the legal system highlights government attempts to keep the mass trial of those who challenge the authority of a greatly unelected government, which is headed by immensely rich royal families, out of public view. This includes banning the handful of relatives, who had previously been allowed to watch the trial, from the courtroom, Human Rights Watch said. ""The day before his detention, officials from the Federal Supreme Court in Abu Dhabi informed al-Hadidi and several other relatives of the defendants that the authorities would no longer allow family members to attend the trial,"" the human rights group said. The court has admitted only local media to cover the trial. Only two members from each detainee's family were allowed in. Royal rulers and opposition . Royal leaders have control over the executive branch of government and over half of the legislative branch, known as the Federal National Council, according to the CIA World Factbook. The other half of the council is democratically elected. Human Rights Watch claimed in March that 64 of the detainees had been held at undisclosed locations for up to a year and denied access to lawyers until February. The group said that two prominent human rights lawyers, Mohammed al-Roken and Mohammed al-Mansoori, are among them, as well as judges, teachers and student leaders. According the charges, ""they launched, established and ran an organisation seeking to oppose the basic principles of the UAE system of governance and to seize power."" Many believe UAE authorities are clamping down on freedom of expression since the Arab Spring swept across the Middle East staring in early 2011. Unelected ruling families in oil-rich Gulf countries such as Bahrain and Saudi Arabia have sought to prevent popular uprisings. Bahrain has also been criticized for its heavy-handed use of force. Political parties and demonstrations are banned in the UAE, and recently an academic from the London School of Economics and Political Science was barred entry to the country. The academic was set to speak at a conference on the political situation in Bahrain.","The son of a man on trial tweeted distortions of proceedings, a court ruled .

"Militant fighters tightened their grip Sunday on western Iraq as security forces withdrew from a handful of towns in Anbar province, moving closer to Baghdad. The news that Iraqi forces withdrew from at least three towns in the province raised questions about whether Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's government is giving up on the region. It also comes the same day that Iran's religious leader condemned any U.S. involvement in Iraq, saying al-Maliki's government can handle its own problems. ""The United States is trying to portray this as a sectarian war. But what is happening in Iraq is not a war between Shiite and Sunnis,"" Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a statement carried by the state-run IRNA news agency. He blamed the attacks in Iraq on the remnants of Saddam Hussein's regime and extremists. But U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, speaking from Cairo, said no one should mistake what is happening and why. ""This is about (ISIS) designs on the state of Iraq,"" he said. ""... The United States is prepared to help Iraq stand up against that."" As part of that effort, Kerry called on al-Maliki's Shiite-dominated government to rise above ""sectarian motivations"" to become more inclusive, more representative of its population. Closer and closer to Baghdad . As international pressure mounts on al-Maliki, ISIS fighters continued their advance from the west and north on Baghdad. Iraqi security officials told CNN that Tal Afar airbase in northern Iraq was taken by militants believed to be ISIS on Sunday afternoon. Militants took over the town of Tal Afar last week but by Sunday, they also controlled the air base completely, officials said. Thousands of Shiite Turkmen families fled the town last week when ISIS attacked the town. The western Anbar town of Rutba, 113 kilometers (about 70 miles) from the borders of Jordan and Saudi Arabia, was in the hands ISIS fighters, two security sources in Baghdad and one in Anbar told CNN on Sunday. With the capture Saturday of Qaim on the border with Syria, where ISIS enjoys a stronghold, and a number of other towns in Anbar province, the fighters now have a direct line to the western outskirts of Baghdad. At least 70% of the province is under the control of ISIS, two security officials in the region told CNN. Iraqi forces withdrew from Haditha, about 270 kilometers (about 168 miles) northwest of Baghdad, during the overnight hours, two security officials in Anbar, speaking on condition of anonymity, told CNN. Sunni tribes considered friendly to the Iraqi army took over security for the town, but officials believe it will fall to ISIS, said the officials, who are not authorized to speak to the media. Haditha is home to the largest hydroelectric plant in Anbar, which is vital to the water supply of the province. Iraq's military spokesman, Maj. Gen. Qassim Atta, told reporters there was a ""strategic withdrawal"" in some areas but did not detail the specific locations. He said the withdrawals were part of a campaign to ""open all these fronts so we can strengthen our positions."" What is ISIS -- and what does it want? Even so, there is a question of whether Iraqi forces can retake the regions under the control of well-armed ISIS fighters. The fighters launched an attack during the overnight hours against one of the two remaining military bases in Anbar, two security officials in the province told CNN. The fighters attacked Khalidiya military base, near Ramadi, but were unable to take it and withdrew early Sunday, the officials said. Al-Asad, a large Iraqi air force base, and the nearby town of Hit are still under the control of the central government. The expectation, the officials say, is that both will be attacked next. Despite the government effort to protect the Iraqi capital, minor clashes were reported between Sunni insurgents, possibly ISIS fighters, and Iraqi security forces in the Sunni town of Abu Ghraib very near Baghdad's western border, according to security officials. Violence elsewhere in Iraq . Sporadic violence was reported across Iraq, including in the Shiite-dominated city of Hillah, about 95 kilometers (60 miles) south of Baghdad, where a recruiting station was shelled. At least four people were killed and 34 were wounded in the attack on the recruiting station, where hundreds of predominantly Shiite men were answer a call to arms to protect Iraq. In the northern city of Mosul, site of one of the first major victories for ISIS militants, witnesses told CNN on Sunday that the group used vehicle-mounted loudspeakers to announce that it had decided to form Islamic Sharia courts in the city. The group also reportedly removed statues of the Christian Virgin Mary, Arab poet Abu Tammam and singer Mulla Othman, witnesses said. The Iraqi government was waiting for the initial group of U.S. military advisers to arrive in Iraq soon, a senior defense official said. This first detail is expected to be very small, the official said. The total number of U.S. military advisers who will eventually deploy will be about 300. In addition, some U.S. military personnel already at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad will be reassigned and become advisers, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said.

"One contestant on ""Arab Idol,"" the Middle Eastern version of American Idol, has been drawing attention because of more than just his impressive vocals. Mohammed Assaf, a 22-year-old college student, is the first ""Arab Idol"" finalist from Gaza. He gained popularity across the Middle East with his touching renditions of patriotic Palestinian songs. He has been a judge favorite since the show began in March and has become a household name in both the West Bank and Gaza, where his poster hangs in restaurants, shops and homes. The young singer has succeeded in achieving what the ""two parties in Palestine failed to do -- unite Ramallah and Gaza,""  wrote parent network MBC in an article on the show's website. Last weekend Assaf received a call from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah, West Bank. ""Abbas confirmed his support of the singer and said that Assaf has made Palestine and the Arab world proud, urging Palestinians and Arabs to vote for the singer,"" reported the official Palestinian news agency, WAFA. It was no small task for Assaf to travel to Cairo to audition for the wildly popular show. ""He needed a visa (to cross the Gaza-Egypt border), but he didn't have one,"" his father, Jabar, told CNN from Khan Younis, a refugee camp in Gaza.  Israel imposes a blockade on Gaza, leaving residents without access to an airport. Palestinian officials had to make special arrangements for Assaf to leave Gaza, his mother, UmShadi, a math teacher, explained. By the time he arrived in Cairo, the doors to the venue where auditions were held had already closed. ""So he jumped the wall,"" she said. Security guards seized him and were going to escort him out when a Palestinian official with the show recognized Assaf from his performances in Gaza and gave him a candidate number, allowing him to compete. When asked by judges on the show why it took him two days to travel the 250 miles from Gaza to Cairo, Assaf simply replied, ""problems at the crossing and such."" Assaf is one of seven children. ""We are refugees!"" his father proclaimed. ""We only dreamed he would get to this point and show the world his beautiful voice. Now we want him to win!"" ""Palestinians are not the way (the world) see(s) them,"" he explained. ""They like to be happy. They like to sing."" ""I am very proud of him -- the fact that he's Palestinian, he is popular, and he makes people happy,"" his mother said. ""We aren't used to the fame,"" she said, ""but we are very happy."" When asked about her son's newfound popularity with the ladies, his mother says, ""The girls don't come here, to our house. But they are all over the Internet and Facebook."" The family says social media has also been a platform where Islamic hardliners have criticized use of the world ""idol"" in the name of the show.  But UmShadi says her eldest daughter took to social media to clarify the context of the word as ""beloved"" rather than ""worshipped."" The show features four judges and 12 finalists from countries across the Middle East. Contestants sing live, and the public votes via text message for their favorite singer. Two finalists were eliminated last weekend, rounding out the top 10. Now in its second season,"" Arab Idol"" has gripped audiences across the world with contestants who represent many of the Middle East's struggles. Competing alongside Assaf for the top spot is the show's first non-Arabic speaking finalist, Parwas Hussein, who is Kurdish, and Iraqi contestant Mohanad Marsoomy. Kurds and Iraqis have long fought over Iraq's northern region, known as Iraqi Kurdistan. There are also two contestants from war-torn Syria, though both have been careful not to take sides. The remaining Arab Idol contestants are: Faris Al Madani from Saudi Arabia, AbdelKarim Hmdan from Syria, Ahmed Jamal from Egypt, Farah Youssef from Syria, Ziad Khoury from Lebanon, Yosra Saouf from Morocco, and Salma Rachid from Morocco.","Mohammed Assaf, 22, is the first ""Arab Idol"" finalist from Gaza .

"(CNN)  -- A volcano in southern Alaska erupted anew Monday, the fifth eruption since coming back to life Sunday night. Mount Redoubt vents steam atop the crater in Alaska on Saturday. A total of five ""explosive events"" were recorded at Mount Redoubt, U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar told reporters Monday. The eruptions sent ash columns some 60,000 feet into the air above the snow-covered peak, and several communities west of Anchorage, Alaska, reported falling ash, officials said. It also raised concern about ash fallout in towns near the volcano. A ""dark and cloudy environment"" was noted near Cook Inlet, Salazar said. Agencies including the Federal Aviation Administration, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Geological Survey were monitoring the situation.  See photos of volcano's ash and steam » . Concern centers mainly on three areas, Salazar said on a Monday conference call with reporters. The first is the ash clouds' effect on air traffic in the vicinity of the volcano. Aircraft carrying a total of roughly 20,000 passengers fly through the area on any given day, Salazar said. ""I understand a number of commercial flights have been canceled coming in and out of Anchorage International Airport,"" USGS geophysicist John Power said earlier Monday. ""We could see disruptions to air travel to south central Alaska, and Alaska as a whole for a period of weeks to months."" Officials are working with the aviation industry to make sure air traffic in the area is safe, Salazar said. The second area of concern is for people on the ground near the mountain, he said, but noted that most residents know what precautions to take, as experts have been warning of an eruption for some time. In Port Alsworth, where about 100 people live year-round, Mark Lang, 56, said that everyone is staying inside. ""Stay indoors and stay out of it as much as you could,"" he advised. In the event residents have to go outside, he said, they wear masks. He said the abrasive ash is dangerous to breathe and ""not good for your lungs."" It could pose a problem for the town, he said, if it prevents airplanes from flying into Port Alsworth. Flying is the only way to get to the town. In Anchorage, about 100 miles from the volcano, residents were getting ready for ash. ""All the masks and filters were sold out in two days,"" said Abi Seaver, 19, of Anchorage. Another resident of Anchorage said the city isn't too concerned. ""It's so far away,"" she said. ""And we live in the Ring of Fire, so it's not an uncommon event."" The third area of concern regards facilities in the area such as he Drift River Oil Terminal, which Salazar described as a ""major terminal"" for the storage of crude oil. But he said measures have been taken in anticipation of an eruption, to prevent environmental damage, and ""we believe everything is safe there."" Experts expect the eruption to follow the same pattern as the last events in 1989 and 1990. That eruption continued for months as the mountain's lava dome grew then collapsed, raising another ash cloud, said Tom Murray, a scientist at the Alaska Volcano Observatory. The ash cloud was moving north, missing the bulk of the population in south-central Alaska, Murray said. ""We are continuing to watch the volcano very closely,"" he said. ""We could have several more phases, such as we've seen."" The eruptions started at at 10:38 p.m. Sunday. Subsequent eruptions occurred at 11:02 p.m., 12:14 a.m., 1:39 a.m. and 4:37 a.m. The USGS estimated the height of the eruption cloud at 50,000 feet and warned that mudflows were possible on the Drift and Crescent rivers, and ashfall was likely near and downwind from the volcano. Ash from the volcano is expected to blow north and pass west of Anchorage, said Dave Schneider, a geophysicist with the Alaska Volcano Observatory. He described the ash as a trace -- meaning if some landed on a windshield, the driver could still see through it. Power said the ash will be about the thickness of a penny or a dime. He warned residents to take precautions. ""It does pose significant problems for mechanical systems, people with respiratory illnesses and aircraft,"" he said, adding that residents should be prepared to stay indoors. Those in range of the ashfall should seal their windows and doors, the National Weather Service said. It also advised that residents protect electronics, minimize driving and cover air intakes and open water supplies. The alert level went to red, the highest level, when the eruptions began, according to the Alaska Volcano Observatory Web page.","NEW: Interior Secretary: Total of five ""explosive events"" recorded at Mount Redoubt .

"To many, the spur-booted buckaroo in the ten-gallon hat may represent a time gone by. But the American cowboy is still alive and well -- and it's not too late to join his (or her) rangeland ranks.

The self-proclaimed Cowboy Capital of the World is stocked with guest ranches and real ranches, welcoming dudes (according to Merriam-Webster, ""a city dweller unfamiliar with life on the range"") as well as legitimate ranch hands. It's practically impossible to pass through town without seeing a rodeo. Horses tied to hitching posts aren't uncommon. There are more than a dozen guest ranches to choose from, but among the most historic is Dixie Dude Ranch, which has lured wannabe wranglers since 1937. An overnight trail ride includes chuck wagon meals and storytelling by the campfire. The cowboy authenticity ends where the massage therapy and pool begin. Possibly the best experience in Bandera is at Arkey Blue's Silver Dollar Saloon -- one of Texas' greatest dance halls.

"Southfield, Michigan (CNN) -- For 12 years, Rabbi Elimelech Goldberg worked at a camp for children battling cancer. He often witnessed the pain and discomfort many of them endured while undergoing medical procedures. ""It's really indescribable, what it's like ... to watch a child go through so much pain,"" said Goldberg, who served as the director of Camp Simcha in New York. ""The child looks at you for help and then you end up having to hold them down."" One day, he tried to soothe a young camper who was screaming in pain during treatment. Goldberg, a black belt in Choi Kwang-Do, offered to teach the 5-year-old boy some of the craft. ""In martial arts, you learn that pain is a message that you don't have to listen to,"" he said. ""That lesson is so unbelievably effective."" Goldberg taught the boy some breathing techniques. When the nurse removed the needle after chemotherapy, he said the boy had hardly noticed. Goldberg realized he was on to something. ""When we are able to breathe through pain and imagine the pain lowering,"" he said, ""the brain has an amazing capacity to put us into a different place."" In 1999, Goldberg founded Kids Kicking Cancer. The program provides free martial arts classes focused on breathing techniques and meditation for children battling serious illnesses. ""When children get a diagnosis like cancer or any major disease, they lose any sense of feeling that they're controlling their lives. They're prodded and poked and touched, and they're often so afraid,"" Goldberg said. ""We teach kids how to control their pain and make them feel powerful."" A personal journey . Goldberg knows what many of the children's families are going through. His first child, Sara, was diagnosed with leukemia a week before her first birthday. Yet he was struck by his daughter's positive spirit during the emotional time. ""She was such an incredible little soul,"" Goldberg said. ""After very painful treatments, she would give the doctors a kiss and thank them."" In 1981, after putting up a strong fight, Sara passed away at age 2. ""She is our inspiration in everything that we do,"" Goldberg said. Through classes and one-on-one support, Kids Kicking Cancer has helped more than 5,000 children and their families. ""We use martial arts as a platform for meditation, for relaxation, to allow children to gain these tools and to really face down so much of the fear and the anger and the junk that accompanies pain,"" Goldberg said. The group provides individual support during hospitalizations and medical procedures. It also offers transportation to and from classes, as well as counseling. Power. Peace. Purpose. Haley Wallace joined Kids Kicking Cancer after she was diagnosed with cancer last year. The 9-year-old used to run for the door when doctors attempted to administer her treatment. Through Goldberg's program, Haley learned to control her fear and pain. ""The way I breathe in the light is, I think of all the happy thoughts. And then the way I breathe out the darkness is I think of the bad thoughts and blow them away,"" said Haley, who recently completed chemotherapy. ""I do have the power to make the pain go away."" The program encourages children to teach what they have learned to other youths and adults experiencing sickness, pain or stress. Goldberg believes that when the children teach the breathing technique to others, the children find purpose in their lives. ""When they demonstrate (that) you can bring in the light and let out the darkness -- the pain, fear and anger -- it changes people,"" he said. For Goldberg, instilling that sense of purpose is especially important for children at the end of their lives. Before terminally-ill children pass away, his group gives black belts to them, organizing ceremonies with their family and friends. The ceremonies are sometimes held in big auditoriums filled with hundreds of people, or they may take place in small ICU rooms with immediate family crowded together. ""When we give children this black belt, we embroider the child's name on one side and the words 'master teacher' on the other, because they really are teaching the world,"" Goldberg said. The organization began in Michigan and has since expanded its programs to New York, Los Angeles and Florida and internationally to Italy, Israel and Canada. ""I am so humbled by these children when they are able to face down big stuff, and you could see that light on their face,"" Goldberg said. ""I feel like their souls are shining.""

"At best, the word networking conjures up images of standing awkwardly at a party, delicately balancing a drink in one hand while you exchange cards with someone you will probably never see again. At worst, it brings to mind a hustler who thrusts their card aggressively in your face with barely a hello uttered, all the while scanning over your shoulder for someone more important. Not surprisingly, the very idea is enough to strike terror into the hearts of most introverted workers, who don't relish the idea of walking into a room full of strangers and striking up conversations. But cleverly done, networking can reap huge benefits for career success, says the UK's renowned ""networking queen"" and ""professor of schmooze"" Julia Hobsbawm. Hobsbawm, who was recently appointed visiting professor in networking at Cass Business School, at City University, London, says in an increasingly global workforce, workers cannot afford to ignore the competitive edge it can give. See also: To reach the top, do what others won't . Previously perceived as a ""soft"" skill,"" Hobsbawm, who also runs networking business Editorial Intelligence, says effective networking will make the difference ""between a highly skilled worker and an average worker."" ""I think professional workers and their employers are going to come to appreciate and understand networking as more of a hard skill than a soft skill,""  she says. ""We take for granted now that certain types of qualifications have to be achieved, and in this global marketplace, where a worker in Nairobi, or a worker in Bombay, or a worker in New York or London, is directly competing with workers they've never met, what will give them the edge is the knowledge skills."" Below is an edited version of the full interview with Hobsbawm. CNN: Why do you emphasize networking more than leadership? Julia Hobsbawm: I think the word leadership is overused and possibly overrated. What matters is that people feel productive and stimulated. The trouble with the emphasis on leadership is that it is aspirational but is not always achieved. The point about networking is everybody can be more productive, everybody can be stimulated and everybody can be more engaged. See also: Why we pick bad leaders . So it's not that I want to dismiss leadership, but what I am saying is that we are in a new era, in which we are all islands surrounded by oceans of information and oceans of possibilities and entire oceans of people we might need. The ability to navigate and chart through those oceans is the skills that we are providing. And that's what I am interested in, part of it, is that I would like everybody to love what they do and how they do it. And lots of corporate individuals that we meet expressed a sense of isolation and alienation. CNN: Why do they experience that? JH: They are isolated and the networking they do is largely confined to an old model of a pretty large-scale event, like walking into a room and standing up in the corner. We find the best networking style is in a relaxed environment, where you have a moment to actually look into somebody's face and think, ""do I trust what I am seeing here?"" That's one of the reasons that women are very good at networking, because we are more naturally blended into our personal and professional personas. That is the shift -- it is not that one does not need to have boundaries and limits, but it is actually OK and will be normal to be more personal than not, in a professional environment. Because we are persons and personalities. CNN: How has social media impacted on traditional networking -- has it made it more effective or the opposite? JH: I think it assisted it in some ways but it has also shown up its own limitations. The word that matters, that people are frightened of and might even be surprised to see, I suppose, in a work or business context, is intimacy. You do get a kind of intimacy with social networking, even with email. People say things in email and tweets that they might be embarrassed about and regret. But deep connections and a sense of trust can only come from face-to-face. It can only come from repeated encounters. So, for example, we are holding a supper club in London where 15 of our club members gather around for what we call a mid-week dinner party. The whole point of the mid-week dinner party is that in a relaxed informal environment, no agenda, interesting ideas happen. It's not just about saying, ""can you be useful?"" it is about ""are you saying something interesting to me that I am learning from?"" What we want now is a blended environment, in which all forms of communication join up more meaningfully. So the person who feels very confident on Facebook and Twitter feels equally confident discussing an idea or a book  in real time, opposite somebody. CNN: What does this growing culture of networking mean for the future? JH: It is arguably a new industry. I mean, there are not as many books written about networking and business theories as there are about leadership or communication or strategy.  Networking has the elements of all three, but it is about human knowledge networks, rather than technological networks.  So there is an emerging academic discipline as well.","Julia Hobsbawm is professor of networking at the UK's Cass Business School .

"Winter is the season to come down with colds. Awful, sniffling, sneezing, muscle-achy colds. We know cold weather has something to do with this. Or do we? We spoke with two experts -- Dr. Sorana Segal-Maurer, chief of the Dr. James J. Rahal Jr. Division of Infectious Disease at New York Hospital Queens, and Dr. Brian P. Currie, vice president and senior medical director of the Montefiore Medical Center in New York -- to find out the truth once and for all. The rumor: Cold weather causes colds . Why is winter the common-cold season? It's a common perception that when the weather gets colder, we tend to get sick more. This is why we bundle up in warm clothes before facing the elements: We want to protect ourselves against frigid weather because we don't want to catch colds. The verdict: Cold weather does not cause colds . According to Segal-Maurer, it isn't actually the cold weather that causes the common cold, it's what we do when it gets cold out. ""When the weather turns cold,"" she says, ""we all run indoors, where air is recycled and we're often in close quarters with other people and viruses. We all sneeze on top of each other."" This is why the cold season is the same -- though maybe not as severe -- in warmer climates like Los Angeles as it is in colder ones like New York or Chicago. ""Dry and cold conditions are probably more high-risk situations for viruses because of dry mucosa,"" adds Segal-Maurer. The mucosa, she says, is what lines your trachea, the back of your throat and your sinuses. Viruses invade the mucosa and start growing, causing your cold. And that's viruses -- as in, plural. The common cold isn't just one type of virus: When you say ""I've got a cold,"" that could mean you have one of many bugs. ""There are a variety of different cold viruses,"" says Currie, ""... so it makes sense that there is no one therapy to treat a cold."" The strength of our own immune system also plays a big part in how susceptible we are to colds, and how severe they might be. ""The extremes are the young babies, the older adults, those with underlying medical conditions,"" explains Segal-Maurer. ""But even those who take low-dose steroids -- those people don't make as many antibodies, and the cells that are supposed to fight infection are not as well equipped to do that. So when they do get a cold, it's more severe. We're all susceptible, but what may be a 24-hour cold for me may be a week (of illness] for somebody else.""","Spending more time indoors in cold weather can foster the spread of viruses .

"This is Autism Awareness Month, and it's a good time to set the record straight on autism and violence. After Sandy Hook, there was a lot of talk about whether shooter Adam Lanza had Asperger's syndrome, a form of autism, and, if so, whether that played a role in his violent behavior. The response from people touched by autism and autism professionals was immediate and unequivocal: There is no connection between any autism spectrum disorder and violent aggression. Unfortunately, stating the facts did little to stop the speculation. It's almost as if people wanted to ""make it so"" as an easy way to explain the inexplicable.  Every new story seemed to mention Asperger's in the headline or opening lines. The implied connection was unmistakable. The truth is, people with autism are far more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators.  Even in our supposedly enlightened society, anyone who is different can become a magnet for bullies and predators. Growing up with undiagnosed Asperger's, I learned that the hard way. So did my son, Jack (I call him Cubby), who also has Asperger's. I'd sensed that all my life, but it's also supported by scientific studies, in both medical and  criminal justice research. Opinion: I have Asperger's and I'm just like you . Those of us on the autism spectrum have enough problems simply being different in an often intolerant world. Thanks to our limited sense of the emotions swirling around us, we live in the shadow of often unseen threats, as so many of us have learned to our detriment. The unspoken emotional subtext that most people take for granted is mysterious and invisible to us. Our oblivion leads to bad feeling, and we never know exactly how and where we went wrong. Media talk of Asperger's and murder -- even when it's only speculation -- raises that threat level significantly. Insinuations like this dehumanize people with Asperger's and label us as ""sociopaths"" or ""future attackers."" Where does that lead? Exclusion, bullying and mistreatment, even more than before. Troubling legacy of Sandy Hook may create backlash against kids with autism . Prejudice affects us in many ways, most all of which are bad. My son found that out four years ago, when a state prosecutor decided that his scientific fascination with explosives was a terrorist threat and only she could ""save"" our community. She charged him with four felonies, carrying a maximum sentence of more than 60 years in prison. Growing up autistic . Cubby was 17 years old when he was indicted. He'd never been in trouble with either the law or in school, and was on track to make Eagle Scout, where he taught the chemistry merit badge course. His only ""crime"" was turning household chemicals into experimental explosives, which he set off and filmed in the woods behind our house. Even the ATF agents who first investigated were impressed by Cubby's scientific acumen and curiosity and certain that he intended no harm. It took a year of our lives, $100,000 and a weeklong jury trial to set the record straight. At the end the prosecutor just walked away, as do most bullies and predators. Our society can be awful long on prejudgment and woefully short on consequences. It's time to change the conversation. Asperger's doesn't make a person a killer or a terrorist.  It's the disturbing truth that anyone can turn violent or deadly, and it's proven very difficult to identify who's vulnerable and what the trigger might be. Opinion: Leave autism out of mass shootings . Psychologist Phil Zimbardo showed that we all have a dark side, one that can emerge quite suddenly, in his famous Stanford Prison Experiment, which was cut off early when students who played prison guards became sadistic and those who played prisoners became depressed. Indeed, most of the rampage killers of the past 30 years apparently popped up out of nowhere. What did we miss? The central question for us as a society should be: How can we identify those people at risk for aggressive violence, and get them support while help is still an option? I believe violence should be a research priority at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health. After the fact analysis doesn't help anyone, and it won't bring back the dead. We need to understand what makes people turn on others and how we can defuse that threat. Groups: Autism not to blame for violence . At the same time, we must learn to stop the rush to judgment when the person next to us acts ""a little strange."" Eccentric people have brought humanity some of its greatest gifts and inventions, and we need to encourage difference, not chase it into hiding. Imagine where we'd be today if Alfred Nobel, who invented dynamite,  had been prosecuted like my son -- instead of praised for his service to humanity.","John Robison: Debunk ""link"" between autism and violence this Autism Awareness Month .

"Ukraine is ground zero in a tense power play between Russia and the West, with U.S. officials saying they just want Ukrainians to be allowed to decide their own fate, and Russian officials saying they simply want to ensure that Russian-speaking Ukrainians have a fair say over how they are governed. Militants, army face off in Ukraine . Officials from both sides say they don't want to impose their influence on the former Soviet satellite, but they have given no indication they would object if the result of this dustup is closer ties: Ukraine is on Russia's doorstep and, though short on cash, is awash in natural resources. 1. What's going on in eastern Ukraine? Eastern Ukraine is home to a large number of pro-Russia, Russian-speaking Ukrainians, and is where the play-out of tensions has been most visible. On Tuesday, acting Ukraine President Oleksandr Turchynov announced an ""anti-terrorist operation"" to restore order to the country's east, saying its aim was to ""stop attempts to tear Ukraine to pieces."" The military then launched its first, formal action against the pro-Russian militants who have seized government and police buildings in at least 11 eastern towns and cities. On Wednesday, helicopters and a fighter jet circled over the city of Kramatorsk and a column of tanks rolled through the city, one with a Russian flag affixed. A similar convoy of armored personnel carriers also entered the city of Slaviansk, some 100 miles from the border with Russia. But there was little sign that the Ukrainian military presence was effective. In a village near Kramatorsk, pro-Russian militants surrounded the Ukrainian forces, took away their vehicles and forced them to surrender, CNN's Nick Paton Walsh reported. They were allowed to depart only after they disabled their weapons. Russian President Vladimir Putin warned earlier that the escalating tension ""essentially puts the nation on the brink of civil war."" 2. What do the people in the east want? They want more say in how their affairs are handled. Ukraine is currently a unitary state, where Kiev makes the major decisions that affect the rest of the country, according to Nicolai N. Petro, a professor of political science at the University of Rhode Island specializing in Russian affairs. ""What folks in the east are asking for is greater autonomy, local self-government,"" he said. Were it to become enshrined in the constitution, that form of autonomy would become a new form of government --  federalism. 3. What do Russian officials want? They say they want to protect the rights of ethnic Russians, but some observers say Putin is wistful for the days of the Soviet Union. ""It's just Russia trying to expand back into the borders of its old empire,"" said Roman Popadiuk, the first U.S. ambassador to Ukraine under George H.W. Bush, from 1992-1993. He is now a principal in Bingham Consulting LLC. 4. How did this all start? It all started with money, or lack thereof. When the Soviet satellite became independent in 1991, hopes were high that it would succeed, given its rich human and natural resources: vast tracts of arable land and stores of coal, iron ore and titanium, said Popadiuk. At the time, the country was largely unified. ""When Ukraine held its independence referendum, almost 91% voted for independence, including the majority of ethnic Russians in Ukraine, including Crimea,"" Popadiuk said. That remained the case in the early to mid-1990s, when Russian nationalists in Russia's parliament and in Crimea wanted Crimea to break away and become more independent. The efforts failed to gain traction. But years of massive corruption and economic stagnation took a toll. The hopes for a better future deflated, only to be renewed late last year, when Ukraine began negotiating an association agreement with the European Union. Then-President Viktor Yanukovych initially said he would sign it. But when he reversed course, deciding instead to sign a deal with Russia, fed up Ukrainians took to the streets. They filled not only Maidan Square in the capital city of Kiev, but protested in western Ukraine and, though to a much lesser extent, in eastern Ukraine. In February, after dozens of demonstrators had been killed, Yanukovych succumbed to the pressure, signing an agreement for a unity government. But he then fled to Russia. Back in Kiev, the Ukrainian government saw the unity government agreement as null and void and parliament took over, appointing an acting president and prime minister and calling for presidential elections to be held May 25. 5. What about Crimea? But Russia, coming off the success of the Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, declared the new government illegal. ""With the Sochi Games over, Putin had a clear opening to move into Crimea,"" Popadiuk said. ""He sent instigators, got the people riled up, introduced troops without insignia, claiming that they were local militia, local citizens."" Russia has said the uprisings have been the work of pro-Russian Ukrainians. In Crimea, where Russia's Black Sea Fleet is based, a referendum was held March 16. Voters were able to choose to become more independent but stay within Ukraine, or to join Russia. The latter option prevailed by an overwhelming margin. Putin then moved troops to near the border with Eastern Ukraine, ""and that's where we are today,"" Popadiuk said. 6. Why did Putin move troops to the border with Eastern Ukraine? ""He thought he would be able to foment a general uprising,"" Popadiuk said. ""That did not happen; Ukrainians stayed quiet."" Moscow said its forces are arrayed along the border to conduct military exercises. 7. So then what happened? Putin has been sending provocateurs and special forces masquerading as Ukrainians into the zone, Popadiuk said, citing news sources as well as sources he would not identify. ""He's basically manufactured an environment of instability,"" one that lends itself to rebellion, he said. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, speaking Tuesday in Beijing, rejected as ""nonsense"" accusations that Russia is fomenting the unrest and supporting the militants. 8. Is it true the country is on the brink of civil war? Petro predicted the tensions will ease ""if Kiev waits them out,"" but could escalate if Kiev resorts to force and there is significant loss of life. Popadiuk said he doubted a civil war would break out, but said that would depend on how hard the Russians push with instigators, whether they introduce troops and how the Ukrainians respond. He applauded the Ukrainians for having responded thus far ""in measured terms."" Rather than allowing themselves to be baited by pro-Russian demonstrators, Ukrainian forces could simply isolate them, he said. ""Let them sit there -- you could have a stand-down for weeks or months. Right now, the ones that are pushing the envelope are the Russians, not the Ukrainians."" Negotiations will prove key, he predicted. ""The Russians are trying to convince the West there is a civil war that could impact the region, and it's necessary for the Ukrainian government to create a federalist structure,"" he said. ""The great fear now is if the West buys that line."" 9. And what if it does? The drawbacks would be obvious, according to Popadiuk. ""By creating a federalist structure you would create regions that are almost autonomous,"" he said, citing the educational system, trade practices and the use of language. That relative autonomy could undermine the strength of the central government in Kiev ""and is a step away from Russians being able to have a referendum along the lines of Crimea -- which could then lead to a breakaway,"" he added. ""It's kind of like taking Ukraine one slice at a time.""","What's going on in eastern Ukraine?

"The man suing ex-NFL star Aaron Hernandez for shooting him in the face has responded to Hernandez's request for a delay in the lawsuit until his murder charges in Massachusetts are resolved. Alexander Bradley, in a motion filed by his lawyer on September 12, argues there's no reason for a delay, because the cases are completely unrelated with no overlapping issues. His attorneys further state any additional delays would be ""highly prejudicial"" to Bradley's case because there is no way of telling how long Hernandez's murder case will take to come to a conclusion. In court papers, Bradley's attorneys maintain ""delaying this case, for what could be years, would be extremely prejudicial to Mr. Bradley in terms of seeking compensation for the very severe injuries he suffered as a result of being shot in the eye."" Grand jury calls 2 to testify in deaths possibly linked to Hernandez . Bradley is suing Hernandez, claiming the then-New England Patriot tight end shot Bradley in February after the two got into a fight at a Miami strip club. In a lawsuit filed in June, Bradley said Hernandez fired at him during a limo ride after leaving the club and that Hernandez intentionally ""possessed a gun which he was not legally licensed to have."" Bradley said he lost the sight in one eye and continues to receive treatment. In a motion filed in early September by his lawyers, Hernandez argues that he's unable to defend himself while battling murder and weapons charges stemming from the execution-style killing in June of Odin Lloyd. Bradley appeared in July before a grand jury investigating Lloyd's death. Prosecutors won't comment on why Bradley was called to testify, citing the secrecy of the proceedings. However, one of Bradley's lawyers has asserted the grand jury likely wanted to relate Hernandez's alleged conduct in Florida to Lloyd's slaying in Massachusetts. Hernandez's lawyers state ""it is beyond any reasonable contention that the issues in Bristol County (Massachusetts) ... overlap those of this case."" Hernandez pleads not guilty . In court papers, Hernandez maintains it would be difficult to adequately defend himself against Bradley's suit while simultaneously battling a murder charge from a jail cell where he's being held without bail. His lawyers also argue that if he had to answer questions in the civil lawsuit during an ongoing criminal case, he would be forced to invoke the Fifth Amendment to protect himself from self-incrimination. In some jurisdictions, they add, invoking the Fifth Amendment would amount to an admission of guilt. Bradley's attorneys say this argument should not be ""well taken,"" citing case law that says use of the Fifth Amendment privilege does not compel an adverse judgment and the mere possibility of suffering a disadvantage does not justify the issuance of a stay. Messages to Hernandez's lawyers were not answered. Hernandez, who pleaded not guilty in Lloyd's death, is next expected to appear in court on October 8 in Fall River, Massachusetts.","Alexander Bradley says his suit against Aaron Hernandez is unrelated to murder charge .

"For District Attorney Sam Sutter, prosecuting fallen NFL football star Aaron Hernandez carries a kind of pressure unprecedented in his six years of service. ""Probably my career ... will be defined more by this case than all of the other things we've done,"" the top law enforcer in Bristol County, Massachusetts, told CNN. ""To that extent, there is added pressure. I can't say in any way that we shirk from it. We welcome it."" A crush of cameras and journalists follows Hernandez, the former New England Patriots tight end, each time he appears in court, including Thursday, when a grand jury indicted him on a first-degree murder charge in the execution-style shooting death of friend Odin Lloyd. Hernandez, who is being held without bail, has pleaded not guilty. His attorney, Michael Fee, calls Hernandez an innocent man and says ""there has been an incredible rush to judgment in this case."" According to a biography on his office's website, Sutter has worked to solve old homicides and ""has employed a series of new and aggressive strategies to attack the problem of gun violence."" He was elected in 2006 and re-elected four years later. The Democrat lost a bid for Congress in 2012. Neither Sutter nor Fee can speak to the evidence because of a court-imposed gag order. ""We have won 14 out of our last 15 murder trials,"" Sutter said. ""I think that's a pretty darn good record."" The next step in Hernandez's case is his arraignment, during which he'll be informed of the crimes he is charged with. Hernandez also faces five weapons charges. Co-defendant Ernest Wallace, who was allegedly in the car with Hernandez the night Lloyd was killed, also was indicted. He was charged with being accessory after the fact to murder. The grand jury also has indicted Tanya Singleton, Hernandez' cousin, for contempt of court. She's charged with refusing to testify before a grand jury, despite being granted immunity. Lloyd's body was found June 17, riddled with five bullets in an industrial park less than a mile from Hernandez' luxury home in North Attleborough. From there, it's roughly a 20 minute drive to the New England Patriots' Gillette Stadium. Authorities have said Hernandez, Carlos Ortiz and Wallace picked Lloyd up from his Boston apartment. Sources have told CNN that Ortiz, who is facing a weapons allegation, is cooperating with authorities. Sutter won't say whether Ortiz is getting a special deal. ""Mr. Ortiz is charged with a serious crime,"" Sutter told CNN. ""Whether or not he's indicted remains to be seen, but right now, he's not getting a pass."" In search warrant affidavits for her home, investigators allege Singleton helped Wallace escape by buying him a bus ticket to Florida. Sutter said Singleton's refusal to testify is ""definitely unusual."" ""We'll see what she does. But I'm not gonna comment on her position, her defiance,"" Sutter said. Singleton's lawyer, Peter Parker, declined comment to CNN. His client has pleaded not guilty. CNN legal analyst Paul Callan suggested that Singleton's decision may indicate she's either extremely loyal or may be worried about something. ""Her refusal of immunity is very surprising,"" he said. As the case moves to Massachusetts Superior Court, Hernandez continues to be held without bail. No trial date has been set.","Former NFL player is charged with first-degree murder, weapons charges .

"International pressure on Nigeria is mounting with protesters taking to the streets around the world to demand the rescue of hundreds of schoolgirls abducted by the terror group Boko Haram. From Los Angeles to London, demonstrators carried posters reading #BringBackOurGirls -- a campaign that began on Twitter following the mass abduction of the girls in April -- and chanted  ""Bring them home!"" ""Not for sale!"" and ""African lives matter!"" The protests on Saturday came the same day that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called on Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan to step up efforts to find the girls who were abducted on April 14 from a school in Chibok, in the country's rural northeast. In Washington, protesters gathered at the Lincoln Memorial to denounce what they described as a poor response by the Nigerian government to rescue the girls. Boko Haram: A bloody insurgency, a growing challenge . Among them was Oluwa Tosin Adegobla, who cried even as she demanded action. ""When you touch kids, I think you've gone too far, especially, when it's kids trying to get an education,"" said Adegobla, who was born in Nigeria. ""... We're getting very little information about what the federal government is actually doing to mobilize a search for those girls."" She criticized the Nigerian President for what she described as a lack of response. The President's press office announced Saturday that Jonathan will deliver a nationwide address on the issue on Sunday. Outcry from angry Nigerians . In Nigeria, angry citizens contend authorities are not doing enough. They took to social media using hashtags #BringBackOurGirls and #BringBackOurDaughters to demand more from the government, a move that appears to have ignited a global call for action. Despite the recent public outcries, the Nigeria's Defense Ministry said it is committed to the search. Even so, protesters have said not enough is being done. ""It irks me that the government is not doing enough to bring back our girls and curb this insurgency,' said Iheanyi Onwubiko to CNN's iReport from Abuja, Nigeria. Onwubiko joined the online protest movement because of a personal connection to one of the kidnapped girls. CNN's iReport: #BringBackOurGirls . The African Union issued a statement on Friday expressing ""support to the efforts being made to rescue the abducted girls and bring to justice the perpetrators of this abhorrent act"" and ""solidarity with the anguished families."" The statement echoed other groups' concerns. ""Can you imagine if 234 girls were abducted from their school in Paris or in Chicago? This would be a nightmare, this would be an uproar,"" Nicole Lee, president of TransAfrica, an African-American foreign policy organization, said at the Washington demonstration. ""... People would care, people would take action and we would want the same for the girls in Nigeria."" During Kerry's televised comment, made during a visit to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, he called on the government to bring those responsible to justice. ""The kidnapping of hundreds of children by Boko Haram is an unconscionable crime, and we will do everything possible to support the Nigerian government to return these young women to their homes and to hold the perpetrators to justice,"" he said. Boko Haram's name translates to ""Western education is a sin"" in the local language. The group especially opposes the education of women. Under its version of Sharia law, women should be at home raising children and looking after their husbands, not at school learning to read and write. Convoy disappears with hundreds of school girls . According to accounts, armed members of Boko Haram overwhelmed security guards at the all-girls schools, herded the girls out of bed and forced them into trucks in the town of Chibok. The convoy of trucks then disappeared into the dense forest bordering Cameroon. On Friday, Nigerian authorities updated the number of girls kidnapped to 276. At least 53 of the girls escaped, leaving 223 in the hands of their captors, police said. Authorities said that the new figure for missing girls -- 223 -- could grow as police fill in spotty school enrollment records. Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department warned citizens against traveling to Nigeria because of a ""fluid and unpredictable"" security situation. The government of Nigeria has issued a state of emergency in the northeastern Nigerian states of Adamawa, Yobe and Borno, where the mass abduction of the girls occurred. At the same time, the U.S. Consulate in Nigeria warned citizens to stay away from the Sheraton Hotel near the city of Lagos because of continued terror threats. ""As of late April, groups associated with terrorism allegedly planned to mount an unspecified attack against the Sheraton Hotel in Nigeria, near the city of Lagos. There was no further information regarding which of the two Sheraton Hotels in Lagos was the possible target, or if both of the Sheraton Hotels are possible targets,"" the statement reads.

"A Massachusetts judge ruled Monday that the public should know exactly what investigators seized from the home of former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez, who has been charged with murder in the death of a friend. Bristol County District Judge Daniel O'Shea ordered the documents to be made available Tuesday afternoon. The documents to be released include search warrants, police affidavits explaining what they were looking for and what was taken away as possible evidence. Hernandez has been charged with premeditated murder in the death of Odin Lloyd, 27. He has pleaded not guilty. O'Shea ruled in favor of a motion filed by media outlets including the Patriot Ledger in Quincy, Massachusetts; the Taunton Daily Gazette in Taunton, Massachusetts; and the Associated Press. Hernandez jersey exchange draws 1,200-plus . Defense attorneys representing Aaron Hernandez opposed the motion. They can appeal the court's decision. In court papers, lawyers for the media argued ""the press's (sic) ability to keep the public informed is premised in large part on open access to the court system and on its ability to examine and report on public documents."" At Hernandez's arraignment last month, prosecutors said they had examined his cell phone and 14-camera home surveillance system. Authorities have said Hernandez, 23, and two other men picked Lloyd up from his Boston apartment early on June 17. Surveillance cameras captured the car at an industrial park near Hernandez's North Attleborough home. Lloyd's body was found in the industrial park later that day, authorities have said. Also on Monday, Ernest Wallace, one of two men who police say was in the car with Hernandez the night Lloyd was killed, agreed to be held without bail pending his next hearing. Patriots owner Kraft speaks out about Hernandez . A prosecutor told a judge in Attleboro, Massachusetts, that Wallace had accepted the decision in the presence of his lawyer, David Meier.  Meier declined to comment to reporters. Wallace winked at his family and appeared to mouth the words ""I love you"" but was not asked to address the court. Wallace is charged with accessory after the fact to murder. He pleaded not guilty. His next hearing is scheduled for July 22. Another man who police say was in the car the night of Lloyd's slaying, Carlos Ortiz, is already being held without bail and has pleaded not guilty to a  weapons charge. At a news conference after Wallace's court hearing, Bristol County District Attorney Samuel Sutter declined to directly  answer a question from CNN about whether Wallace or Ortiz is cooperating with authorities. Search of Hernandez's apartment reveals new evidence . ""It's an excellent question,"" Sutter said. ""But I'm not going to comment one way or the other at this point."" A law enforcement source has told CNN that Ortiz is cooperating with investigators but declined to elaborate. In court papers, Ortiz allegedly told police that the day after Lloyd was killed, he and Hernandez went to a Franklin, Massachusetts, apartment leased by Hernandez. In the apartment, investigators say there was a ""white colored hooded sweatshirt"" similar to the one he was seen wearing on surveillance video the night of the killing. Ortiz has a status hearing scheduled for Tuesday, but prosecutors say if Ortiz agrees to continue to be held without bail, the hearing will likely be canceled.

"Two friends of former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez were indicted on murder charges Friday in connection with the 2013 homicide of Odin Lloyd in North Attleboro, Massachusetts, according to the Bristol County District Attorney's Office. The associates, Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace, allegedly were in the car with Hernandez the night of the murder. Hernandez, 24, is being held on first-degree murder and weapons charges in the shooting death of Lloyd. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges. Authorities have said Hernandez, Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace picked Lloyd up from his Boston apartment in the early morning of June 17. Surveillance cameras showed the car at an industrial park near Hernandez's North Attleborough, Massachusetts, home. Surveillance cameras then captured the rental car leaving the crime scene and Hernandez carrying a gun as he returned to his home minutes later. He was with two other people. Lloyd -- a 27-year-old semi-pro football player himself -- was not among them. Lloyd's body was found in the industrial park later that day. Prosecutors have accused Hernandez of orchestrating the death of Lloyd, who was shot five times with a .45 caliber handgun. Ortiz and Wallace were already being held on charges related to the Lloyd murder when the indictments were handed down Friday. ""Ernest Wallace did not shoot or kill anybody,"" his attorney, David Meier of Boston, told CNN. ""The nature and timing of these new charges against Mr. Wallace speak for themselves. One can only ask are these charges based on the facts and the law or something else. Mr. Wallace looks forward to confronting his accusers in the courtroom,"" Meier said. Ortiz, 27, of Bristol, Connecticut, had been indicted in September on a single count of accessory to murder after the fact in connection with Lloyd's death. Ortiz's attorney, John Connors, told CNN that he heard about the indictment not from the district attorney, but from the news media. ""I was a bit shocked,"" Connors said. ""I knew the matter had come up before a second grand jury ... but, to my knowledge, there's been no new discovery ... no new information."" ""First, they charged him with being an accessory ... and now, all of a sudden they indict him for murder,"" Conners added. Maybe, it's political."" Asked to elaborate, he said, ""Maybe you should ask the DA."" Wallace, who also was indicted last fall on an accessory-after-the-fact-to-murder charge, had turned himself in to police in Miramar, Florida, at his family's home more than a week later after taking a bus to Florida from Georgia. In addition, Hernandez's fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins, 24, was charged in September with a single count of perjury and his cousin, Tanya Singleton, 37, was charged with ""conspiracy to commit accessory after the fact."" Singleton, who was already being held on a previous indictment for contempt of court by allegedly refusing to testify before a grand jury, saw both of the cases against her combined.

"A suicide bomber driving a car packed with explosives killed at least 34 people and wounded 121 others at a police checkpoint in the southern Iraqi city of Hilla, police officials said on Sunday. Iraq has been beset with political and sectarian violence for months. More than 700 Iraqis were killed and nearly 1,400 others were wounded in terrorist attacks and other violence in February, the United Nations has said. Militants took over a city council building days before . Sunday's attack happened at the entrance of the city, the police officials told CNN. Hilla is a predominantly Shiite Muslim city about 100 kilometers (60 miles) south of the capital, Baghdad. Two Iraqi journalists who worked at state-run Iraqiya TV died in the attack, the station reported. Violence has raged in the country in the past year, often pitting Sunnis -- a minority in Iraq -- against Shiite Muslims, who came to dominate the government after Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein was overthrown in 2003. The United Nations said 2013 was the deadliest year in Iraq since 2008, with almost 8,000 people killed. Security forces have also been fighting insurgents from the al Qaeda-affiliated Islamic State of Iraq and Syria in western Anbar province, which borders Syria.","At least 34 people killed, 121 wounded in suicide attack .

"Aaron Hernandez -- already accused of first-degree murder -- was indicted Thursday on charges stemming from a jailhouse fight, a district attorney's office in Massachusetts said. A grand jury in Bristol County on Thursday afternoon indicted Hernandez, 24, on charges of assault and battery tied to the February 25 altercation, according to a statement from that county's district attorney's office. The former New England Patriots standout tight end also was indicted Thursday for threats to do bodily harm in connection with a November incident in which he allegedly threatened someone who worked at the jail. Hernandez will be arraigned on these new indictments at a date yet to be set by the court, said the statement. An attorney for Hernandez did not immediately respond Thursday to a CNN message. Attorneys have not responded to questions about the alleged February 25 fight involving an unidentified inmate. Neither man was seriously injured in that altercation. Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson earlier told CNN that jail officials would look at how the two inmates came into contact, because ""no more than one inmate is supposed to be out at a time"" in the unit in which Hernandez is housed. Hernandez is behind bars on a murder charge, to which he's pleaded not guilty. Authorities have said that Hernandez and two other men picked up Odin Lloyd from his Boston apartment in a rental car shortly before Lloyd was found shot to death on June 17. Surveillance cameras then captured the rental car leaving the crime scene and Hernandez carrying a gun as he returned to his home minutes later, according to authorities.","District attorney's office: Hernandez is charged with assault and battery tied to fight .

"Gunmen ambushed two areas in coastal Kenya early Sunday, leaving at least 22 people dead, authorities said. At least 13 people died when attackers opened fire after midnight in Hindi near the popular tourist coast of Lamu, the Kenyan Red Cross said. Hindi is near Mpeketoni, where assailants killed dozens of people under the cover of darkness last month. A second overnight raid killed nine people at a police station in Gamba in Tana River county. One other person was hospitalized, and another was reported missing, the Kenyan Red Cross said. The Al-Shabaab Islamist terror group claimed responsibility for the weekend attacks, saying its militants killed 50 people and pledging more bloodshed. ""Our fighters came back their base unharmed after the attacks,"" the terror group's spokesman, Sheikh Abdiaziz Abu Musab, told the Somalia-based Radio Andalus. Kenya's tourism industry has taken a hit amid attacks in the coastal region. In May, tour companies evacuated hundreds of vacationers from Kenya after the UK and the United States issued travel alerts that warned of a ""high threat"" of terrorist attacks. Al-Shabaab, a Somali-based militant group, has claimed responsibility for most attacks. The Kenyan military crossed into Somalia in 2011 to battle Al-Shabaab, which it blamed for kidnapping tourists in the coastal region. In retaliation, the terrorist group has launched a spate of attacks, including targeting bustling bus stations with grenades. Last year, militants stormed the Westgate Mall in Nairobi and held shoppers under siege for days. At least 67 people were killed. READ: What is Al-Shabaab?

"Washington (CNN) -- A prominent Food and Drug Administration researcher sharply criticized a safety study by the manufacturer of the diabetes drug Avandia on Tuesday as an FDA panel weighed whether to yank the drug from the market. The study, dubbed RECORD by GlaxoSmithKline, came under attack throughout the first of two days of hearings by the 33-member FDA advisory committee. ""You can't trust it, and if we do trust it, we're engaging in the willing suspension of disbelief,"" said Dr. David Graham, the FDA scientist who first flagged deadly side effects of the painkiller Vioxx. Graham's report followed a strongly worded FDA report last week that called the RECORD study ""inappropriate and biased."" It accused Glaxo of repeatedly submitting sloppy data and failing to follow up on reports of problems among patients, including deaths. But Dr. Murray Stewart, Glaxo's vice president for clinical development, said the company's studies ""provide the most robust and reliable data"" to assess Avandia's safety -- and those studies have found ""no evidence to suggest"" the drug increases the risk of heart attack or stroke in its users. The FDA panel could vote Wednesday on whether to remove the drug, which is used to control blood sugar levels in diabetics, from the market. Glaxo says several trials have shown Avandia is safe, but its usage has fallen sharply since a 2007 study that linked ito the an increased risk of heart attacks and other related problems. Published estimates indicate sales of Avandia have dropped from about $3 billion in 2006 to about $1 billion. One of the committee members, Dr. Sanjay Kaul, urged caution ""before drawing any definitive conclusions"" based on data he called ""fragile."" That drew a blunt response from Dr. Steven Nissen, the Cleveland Clinic cardiologist who authored the 2007 study and presented an updated, critical assessment of the drug Tuesday. ""Whose fault is that?"" Nissen asked. ""We have a drug that has been on the market for 11 years. The company had every opportunity to do large-outcome trials, adequately powered and properly run, to answer this question. They didn't do it."" In a study published in June, Graham also found patients on Avandia are more likely to suffer stroke, heart failure or premature death than patients who used another drug. And he said the RECORD study would have been dismissed as ""garbage"" if it had been used to seek the drug's original approval. ""It wouldn't even be presented,"" he said. And as the FDA panel prepared to meet, a Senate committee added to the controversy by releasing documents its leaders said show Glaxo ""failed to publish studies that found serious health risks associated with Avandia in a timely manner and actively promoted the drug despite the known safety concerns."" The documents, which the Senate Finance Committee provided to the FDA, include studies that date back to 2000, the committee's Democratic chairman and ranking Republican said. ""Americans have a right to know there are serious health risks associated with Avandia and GlaxoSmithKline had a responsibility to tell them. Patients trust drug companies with their health and their lives and GlaxoSmithKline abused that trust,"" Montana Sen. Max Baucus, the committee's chairman, said in a statement accompanying the documents. In February, the same committee released a report criticizing the FDA's handling of Avandia and saying the FDA has been ""too cozy"" with drug makers. But in an e-mail, Glaxo spokeswoman Mary Anne Rhyne told CNN the new documents were ""a small subset"" of millions of pages the company released in connection with lawsuits over the drugs. ""They include drafts and other documents taken out of context, which therefore are incomplete and misleading,"" Rhyne said. ""The documents do not offer new clinically relevant scientific information, and do not provide the full extent of GSK's studies and evaluation of Avandia."" Rhyne said the company ""has been diligent in providing its safety data on Avandia to the FDA"" and publishing results in medical journals and online.

"An Ohio man intended to save the life of his older sister by donating a kidney to her -- a sacrifice on his part that ended in vain a year ago when a nurse mistakenly threw away the donated organ. Paul Fudacz Jr. and his sister, Sarah, say the University of Toledo Medical Center ""utterly botched"" their kidney transplant surgery. The medical center this week said it has ""worked hard to learn from this incident"" and apologized to the family. But on Tuesday it asked that a lawsuit be dismissed and denied claims of gross negligence and failure to meet accepted standards of care. The civil complaint contends Paul Fudacz's right kidney was considered a ""perfect match"" for his sister, then 24, who reportedly suffered from end-stage renal disease. During the brother's surgery on August 10, 2012, his  kidney was placed in a ""slush machine"" until it could be moved to his sister's room, where she'd yet to undergo her surgery. A nurse, who was cleaning up, had just returned from a lunch break and thought the kidney was already in Sarah's room when she discarded the machine's contents, according to the lawsuit. While the kidney was later recovered, it couldn't be used because it had been thrown away with other infected or unsterile medical waste, the Fudacz family alleges. Sarah Fudacz required additional dialysis and four dialysis-related surgeries before she received a replacement kidney three months later, the lawsuit states. ""When compared to Paul Jr.'s kidney, Sarah's new kidney is a poorer match and of poorer quality,"" and she has a higher risk of rejecting it over time, the lawsuit claims. The pair's parents also claimed they suffered emotional distress and a ""loss of consortium,"" or loss of family relationships. But the Ohio attorney general contends parents of adult children and siblings cannot make such a claim about loss of consortium in such a case. Each of eight Fudacz family members -- including four other siblings -- are seeking in excess of $25,000. Dr. Jeffrey Gold, chancellor and executive vice president for health affairs, University of Toledo Medical Center, said the university ""continues to express the sorrow that we feel that this unfortunate incident occurred. We apologize sincerely."" ""While the legal realities of this situation are complex and ongoing, we have worked hard to learn from this incident and have spread the lessons widely to try to make hospitals and transplant programs safer across the country."" In the wake of the incident, the hospital temporarily suspended its live kidney donor program. It has since resumed operations. The nurse involved in the incident retired from the hospital. The surgeon in charge of the planned transplant no longer directs the kidney transplant program but continues to perform them and remains a professor, the University of Toledo Medical Center said.

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- Dignitaries, a red carpet and a child with a bouquet of flowers greeted Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad when he landed at Istanbul airport in Turkey on Monday. It was perhaps the warmest welcome he has received in weeks. Ahmadinejad's trip to attend a United Nations summit of the world's poorest countries is his first overseas journey since a public spat erupted between himself and Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Where in the world is Ahmadinejad? Top officials and media outlets close to Khamenei have mounted a campaign of criticism targeting Ahmadinejad, while several of his top aides have reportedly been arrested. The reported arrest of presidential palace prayer leader Abbas Amirifar on charges of ""sorcery"" is perhaps the best sign of how serious the political feud in Tehran has gotten. Amirifar produced a controversial film predicting the imminent return of the Shiite saint Mehdi, a messianic prediction that Ahmadinejad often refers to in his speeches. On Sunday, Ahmadinejad denied reports that Amirifar had been accused of ""sorcery."" According to Iran's state-run Press TV agency, Ahmadinejad said: ""Those who accuse the government of being influenced by superstitions are 'joking.'"" But as recently as last Friday, the crowd at the state-sanctioned prayer service in Tehran chanted ""death to opponents of the supreme leader."" Long-time observers of Persian politics saw the chant, which was broadcast on state radio, as a warning to the embattled president. Much of the public criticism has also targeted Ahmadinejad's brother-in-law and chief of staff, Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei. ""There's been no question that President Ahmadinejad has been damaged in this apparent power struggle with Iran's supreme leader,"" said Scott Peterson, Istanbul-based journalist and author of ""Let the Swords Encircle Me."" ""What is not yet clear is how much damage has been done, and how it will affect Ahmadinejad's final two years in office,"" he said. ""The scale of Ahmadinejad's political problems are made clear by the charges of sorcery and religious deviation that have been leveled against his chief of staff and some of the closest aides to him,"" Peterson said. ""Normally such charges in the Islamic Republic would be considered apostasy and can be seen as a serious challenge to Iran's religious system."" The surprisingly public power struggle at the highest levels of Iranian government erupted on April 17, when Ahmadinejad fired Intelligence Minister Heidar Moslehi. Supreme Leader Khamenei vetoed the move. For more than a week, Ahmadinejad retreated from the public eye, reportedly refusing to show up for work. Finally, on May 1, he attended a meeting of his cabinet. But Moslehi was conspicuously absent, reportedly due to a scheduling conflict. There are signs that Ahmadinejad may have capitulated in his disagreement with Khamenei. Sunday, Ahmadinejad appeared at cabinet meeting for the first time in a month with the disputed intelligence minister, Press TV reported. And the Islamic Republic News Agency published a series of photos on Sunday, showing Ahmadinejad seated at the left hand of Supreme Leader Khamenei at a ceremony commemorating the death of the daughter of the Prophet Mohammed. The president swore allegiance to the leader and stressed his dedication to the principle of Velayat-e-Faqih, or Guardianship of the Supreme Jurisprudence, which forms the bedrock of Iran's Shiite theocratic rule. And the president's office published the following curt statement on its website Saturday: ""Regarding the false accusations and rumors about President Ahmadinejad that certain news sites have published, this news is wrong and it's hereby rejected. Obviously, the official views, opinions, and news about the dear president, is published by the official site, www.president.ir, and all other media is not reliable.""","President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad appears to be battling Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama signed a sweeping overhaul of child nutrition standards Monday, enacting a law meant to encourage better eating habits in part by giving the federal government more authority to set standards for food sold in vending machines and elsewhere on school grounds. Among other things, the $4.5 billion measure provides more money to poor areas to subsidize free meals and requires schools to abide by health guidelines drafted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. To help offset the higher cost of including more fruits and vegetables, the bill increases the reimbursement rate for school lunches. The bill is about ""giving our kids the healthy futures they deserve,"" the president said during a bill signing ceremony at a Washington elementary school. ""Right now across the country too many kids don't have access to school meals."" Even when they do, he added, too often the meals aren't sufficiently nutritious. As a result, he said, one out of every three children in America is overweight or obese. Some Democrats had objected to the bill because it is funded in part by stripping $2.2 billion from the federal food stamp program. Congress also voted over the summer to take money from the program to fund legislation sending money to cash-strapped states to avoid teacher layoffs. The cuts largely negate a spending increase provided to the food stamp program by the 2009 economic stimulus plan. Administration officials reportedly have promised anxious liberals that they will work to find ways to restore the higher funding levels. The measure has been a top priority for first lady Michelle Obama, who has championed it as part of her ""Let's Move"" initiative to combat child obesity in the United States. ""Had I not been able to get this bill passed, I would be sleeping on the couch,"" the president joked shortly before signing the measure into law. ""We won't go into that,"" the first lady said. ""Let's just say it got done. Don't have to go down that road.""","President Obama signs a bill meant to encourage healthier eating habits among children .

"Goalkeeper Mohamed Saqr was the hero as Al Sadd became the first Qatari football club to win the Asian Champions League title on Saturday. The 30-year-old saved two penalties as his side beat South Korea's Jeonbuk 5-4 in the deciding shootout after the final ended 2-2 following extra-time at the Jeonju World Cup Stadium. Coach Jorge Fossati was delighted with his player after Al Sadd booked a place at the FIFA World Club Cup in December. ""When I returned to the club, many people told me that Mohamed Saqr cannot play anymore. They say he is too old,"" the Uruguayan told the Asian Football Confederation website. ""He played fantastic today but believe me, it was not the only game that he was fantastic in this competition. Today he had a big game: the Jeonbuk players did not miss the penalties, he saved them. ""In the game he also made two or three very important saves, the one at the end was extraordinary, and he showed everybody that he can play and he can continue to play."" Fossati returned to Al Sadd this year after being sacked by Saudi club Al-Shahab in December, having last worked in Qatar as national coach in 2008. ""I could not imagine that it would go to penalties. I really was very worried especially when it went to extra-time because our physical condition to play this game was not the same as normal. When you fly 10 hours two days ago, you need to adapt to the different time zone,"" the 58-year-old said. With home advantage, Jeonbuk had been seeking to add to the club's 2006 title in front of a record 41,000 fans. Brazilian midfielder Eninho ensured the perfect start when he curled in a free-kick after only 17 minutes, but Sim Woo-yeon headed a cross by Abdulkader Keita into his own net just before the half hour. The Ivory Coast striker put Al Sadd ahead in the 69th minute, but the hosts equalized when substitute Lee Sung-hyun headed home in stoppage time. Jeonbuk hit the woodwork for the third time in the match during the extra period, but Al Sadd held on before Ali Afif was sent off for a second yellow card right at the end. Saqr saved penalties from Kim Dong-chan and Park Won-jae, while Al Sadd's South Korea international defender Lee Jung-Soo hit the crossbar before Algeria's Nadir Belhadj netted the decisive spot-kick. Jeonbuk striker Lee Dong-gook was named the competition's top player after finishing as overall leading scorer, with nine of his team's 33 goals. ""I am particularly disappointed that I became injured at a crucial time and I am very sorry to all the home fans that I could not show my full potential in this game tonight,"" said the 32-year-old, who started the final on the bench after picking up a knock in the first leg of the semi against Saudi side Al Ittihad. ""I feel very responsible for not being able to play to my full potential today and I want to apologize to our fans.

"As electronic cigarettes increase in popularity, calls to the nation's poison control centers about exposure to the liquid nicotine used in many of the devices have surged, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday. In February, there were 215 poison center calls involving e-cigarettes, the CDC said in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. That's compared to one per month in September 2010. And 51% of those calls involved children 5 and under, officials said. Since not all poisonings get reported, the CDC said the total number of cases is likely even higher. Nicotine is a drug, and in its concentrated liquid form, poison experts warn it is also significantly toxic, even in small doses. E-cigarettes, which are not required to be childproof, feature flavors like spearmint, banana and bubble gum, making them appealing to kids. ""What's attractive to kids: It's the smell. It's the scent. It's the color,"" said Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center. ""A kid's not going to know the difference between a poison and something they can drink."" An Oklahoma mother found that out the hard way when her 4-year-old son got his hands on the liquid nicotine used to refill her e-cigarettes. ""We hear a little noise, come in and he has taken the lid off of all of them and has this liquid everywhere. He's got it all over him. He's been eating it,"" Ren Gaulrapp told CNN affiliate KFOR. Her son was rushed to the emergency room and vomited all day long. E-cigarettes: Healthy tool or gateway device? Poisonings can also occur when liquid nicotine is inhaled or absorbed through the skin or eyes, and other side effects can include nausea and eye irritation. It can even be deadly. One person used the liquid to commit suicide by injecting it, according to the CDC. Lopez said his poison center has also taken calls from adults who've spilled e-cigarette nicotine on themselves while filling up the devices. ""You can start to feel sick in as little as four to five minutes,"" he said. ""The fumes themselves can be poisonous, and if we inhale them for long enough we're going to get a little sick to our stomach."" About 42% of the poison calls in February involved people age 20 and older, the CDC said. E-cigarette products are currently not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. Poison control experts say the liquids, found in bottles or cartridges that have been known to break, need to be better controlled. ""There's no legislation on the books right now,"" Lopez said. ""A product as dangerous as this, as lethal as this, child-resistant caps would be a great help."" Ray Story, founder of the Tobacco Vapor Electronic Cigarette Association, said his association promotes childproof packaging, warning labels, and limits on the potency of liquid nicotine sold in bottles. ""We have expressed our concerns about unregulated liquids on many occasions, but we do not want to demonize them as the culprit for this problem,"" Story said in a statement. ""The toxicity for all products is in the dosage."" ""We have provided the regulatory bodies information and guidelines on this that can easily be implemented and then could eliminate these cases entirely."" Educating e-cigarette users is also a crucial step in eliminating the incidents, he said. ""Responsibly marketed and properly regulated, it is possible that e-cigarettes could benefit public health if they help significantly reduce the number of people who use conventional cigarettes and die of tobacco-related disease,"" said Matthew Myers, president of Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, in a statement. ""But in the absence of FDA oversight, the easy availability of nicotine in uncontrolled quantities, packaging and flavors and marketing that appeals to youth raises serious concerns."" Gaulrapp, the mother in Oklahoma, said she has since moved her liquid nicotine up and out of her son's reach. ""It smells like candy. It really isn't,"" she told KFOR. ""This really can hurt you."" Opinion: FDA oversight of e-cigarettes overdue .","Calls to poison control centers about e-cigarettes are rising, the CDC says .
More than half of February calls involved young children .
Liquid nicotine poisoning can occur from ingestion, inhalation or skin absorption ."
"There's one thing that even the traveler who can afford to go anywhere can't buy: time. Rest assured, if they could, our nation's wealthy would slip through history in nuclear-powered DeLoreans, splashing time-space mud upon the rest of us present-bound plebes as they zoomed past. To help them out (all of us, really), we've identified the next best thing: a roundup of destinations -- from bucolic to bourgeois -- that will make you forget what era you're in. Hotel Monteleone (New Orleans) New Orleans is like an accordion of time, with every period folded over onto itself, forming a single wild note. This sound can be heard loudest in the French Quarter. No hotel captures the rich, rhythmic history of the city like Hotel Monteleone. Built in 1886, the Beaux-Arts style high-rise transports you to the early city's heyday as soon as you enter its majestic white marble-covered lobby. Done up in elegant style, author suites are named after favorite former guests William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway, Tennessee Williams and Truman Capote. A visit to the Carousel Bar & Lounge is practically mandatory. The bar has been revolving for 64 years and specializes in the Vieux Carre Cocktail -- a mixture of Benedictine, Peychaud, Angostura bitters, rye whiskey, cognac and dry vermouth that was reportedly invented by one of the Monteleone bartenders as patrons spun around him. Hotel Monteleone, 214 Royal St., New Orleans; +1 504 523 3341; rooms from $170 . The Biltmore Hotel (Miami/Coral Gables) Constructed with Italian, Spanish and Moorish influences, the Biltmore in Miami-Coral Gables is a towering, opulent castle rising from South Florida's tropical terrain. During its prime, the Coral Gables Biltmore was a favorite of the Vanderbilts, the Roosevelts, mobsters, celebs and European dignitaries. While you can no longer see weekly synchronized swimming and alligator wrestling, take swimming lessons from Johnny Weissmuller (before he was Tarzan) or dance to oversized jazz orchestras, there are still plenty of old school luxuries. For instance, the Donald Ross-designed golf course, originally constructed in 1925, and afternoon tea while listening to classical guitarists. The Biltmore,1200 Anastasia Ave., Coral Gables, Florida; +1 835 311 6903; rooms from $209 . Beverly Hills Hotel (Beverly Hills, California) Built in 1912, the Beverly Hills Hotel predates the city of Beverly Hills by two years. Early on, the Mediterranean-revival building hosted Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton and Will Rogers, and the star power carried on through the years. Elizabeth Taylor spent six of her eight honeymoons at the Pink Palace. From the '40s-era Formica counter and pink stools of the Fountain Coffee Room to the canopied beds to the white-and-forest-green-striped Polo Lounge, it's easy to forget which war is on. Beverly Hills Hotel, 9641 Sunset Blvd., Beverly Hills, California; +1 310 276 2251; rooms from $492 . Hotel Lautner (Desert Hot Springs, California) The Desert Hot Springs Motel was a midcentury-modern oasis designed by Frank Lloyd Wright protégé John Lautner. The building was originally intended as the first of many that would constitute a new community in Desert Hot Springs -- the brainchild of film director Lucien Hubbard -- but the plan was abandoned and the motel became a destination for stars looking for a quick flutter away from the City of Angels, less than two hours west. The site soon went into disrepair, then endured a few lives of its own before an interior designer and furniture designer purchased, revitalized and renamed the motel. Now Hotel Lautner is an ode to its namesake. Every inch keeps in tune with the architect's philosophy, yet each room feels as fresh as if Lautner gave the final OK just a few months ago. Hotel Lautner, 67710 San Antonio St., Desert Hot Springs, California; +1 760 832 5288; closed July and August; rooms from $225 . Dunton Hot Springs (Dolores, Colorado) If you're hankering for a trip back in time, maybe the 1880s Wild West suits your boots. About 30 miles southwest of Telluride sits Dunton Hot Springs, a former gold and silver mining village that's been transformed into a rustic paradise with 12 cabins, a dance hall and an open-air chapel. The ""town"" draws guests who want to leave cell phone service behind and relax in the natural hot springs. Though visitors are surrounded by nothing but nature, they're far from roughing it -- each cabin has been restored with elegance and comfort that couldn't have been imagined by early settlers, even if they'd struck it rich. Dunton Hot Springs, 52068 Road 38, Dolores, Colorado; +1 970 882 4800; from $600 . Grand Hotel (Mackinac Island, Michigan) To get back to an age when carriages shared the roads with pedestrians and bicycles, you need to visit Mackinac Island, where you can stay at the aptly named Grand Hotel. Opened in 1887, the massive Queen Anne-style hotel has remained largely unchanged since the early years when Edison Phonograph agents held demonstrations and Mark Twain lectured in the casino. Cars were allowed for about three decades, but the citywide ban on them began in 1930. Perhaps the hotel's grandest distinction is its porch: At 660 feet it's said to be the longest in the world. Guests can walk the entire length or sit in one of dozens of white rocking chairs and look out over Lake Huron. Grand Hotel, 286 Grand Ave., Mackinac Island, Michigan; +1 800 334 7263; rooms from $139 . Plaza Hotel (New York) You can almost feel the jazz radiating from the walls of this historic F. Scott Fitzgerald haunt. The Lost Generation's most famous partier loved the Plaza so much, he made it a setting in his greatest work, ""The Great Gatsby."" The hotel hasn't shied away from the honor. They've even gone so far as to create a Fitzgerald Suite. If you prefer a room unburdened by photos of Leonardo DiCaprio and Carey Mulligan, there are other vintage options available. Whether you're staying at the hotel or not, a night in any of the hotel's dining and drinking venues might make you feel like you could run into Jay Gatsby at any moment. Plaza Hotel, 768 Fifth Ave., New York; +1 212 759 3000; rooms from $533 . Old Faithful Inn (Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming) For more than a century, nature lovers have been staying at the largest log hotel in the world, overlooking America's favorite (and most punctual) wonder. The colossal rustic lodge is just as impressive as it was when it opened in 1904, and probably just as crowded, so don't expect much intimacy or peace during peak hours. There's also the matter of a tacky tourist shop and mediocre food. But where else can you stand on a terrace with a cocktail, watching moose grazing below, as boiling water shoots 185 feet up from the earth in the distance?

"Aaron Hernandez was destined to be a football superstar and was already one of the NFL's most promising tight ends. But less than a year after signing a $40 million contract extension with the football powerhouse New England Patriots, he was charged with first-degree murder. Two hours after his arrest on June 26, 2013, the Patriots dropped him from the team. Hernandez, then 23, pleaded not guilty in the slaying of Odin Lloyd and is being held in a Massachusetts jail without bail. Hernandez has also been charged in the slayings of two other men, and some of his closest associates are facing serious charges in connection with the alleged crimes. Friends and fans alike wonder: How could the star player who had more than 900 receiving yards in 2011 now be accused of murdering three people? From 'golden boy' to behind bars . Long before Hernandez made national headlines, he was a standout athlete in Bristol, Connecticut, who came from a family described as a local sports dynasty. ""I don't think there was another family that was more familiar in Bristol,"" Bob Montgomery, who covers high school sports for the Bristol Press, told CNN. The young Hernandez was the ""golden boy,"" playing football, basketball and running track, following in the footsteps of his uncle, older brother and father -- all well-known athletes in the community. Hernandez's father constantly pushed his son, requiring him to practice for hours before he could go out with friends. ""I saw a closeness with them that I'd never seen before,"" Montgomery said of the relationship between Hernandez and his father. But his father, the man who kept the 16-year-old anchored, died from complications after a routine surgery. Hernandez left high school halfway through his senior year in January 2007 to join the University of Florida Gators, and trouble seemed to follow. In just his first semester, a police report says Hernandez got into a fight at an off-campus restaurant, sucker-punching the manager and rupturing his eardrum. The following fall, there was a shooting near a local club. Police reports link Hernandez and several other University of Florida football players to an argument in the parking lot. Hernandez was one of more than 20 people interviewed by police, and he was the only one who did not make a statement after invoking his right to counsel. At the time, Hernandez's mother told the Orlando Sentinel newspaper, ""I know he was at the club, but he never saw any shooting."" The case remains open, and no one has been charged. Hernandez was also suspended at least once for marijuana, an issue that would follow him as he entered the draft his junior year. Trying to put the alleged drug use behind him, Hernandez wrote a letter to the Patriots' director of personnel. ""If you draft me as a member of the New England Patriots, I will willfully submit to a bi-weekly drug test throughout my rookie season. ... In addition, I will tie any guaranteed portion of my 2010 compensation to these drug tests and reimburse the team a pro-rata amount for any failed drug test,"" he wrote, according to the Boston Globe. Before the draft, Hernandez was expected to be a first or second round pick. He was passed over until the fourth round, when the Patriots selected him. By the end of the second season, he was a bona fide star, inking the five-year contract extension worth $40 million. One month before signing the deal, however, he was partying at a Boston club. That same night, two men from the club were found dead. Did spilled drink lead to slaying? Investigators allege Hernandez shot and killed Daniel Abreu and Safiro Furtado on July 16, 2012, because one bumped into him on a nightclub dance floor and spilled his drink. District Attorney Patrick Haggan described the scene in a Massachusetts courtroom in May, saying Hernandez became ""angered and increasingly agitated, particularly after Mr. Abreu smiled and did not apologize."" Prosecutors: Bump, spilled drink led to double homicide . Hernandez's friend tried to calm him down, and the pair walked outside and eventually entered a second club across the street, the prosecutor said. Court documents identify that friend as Alexander Bradley, who would go on to accuse Hernandez of shooting him in the eye in an incident that would take place seven months later. After leaving the second nightclub, Hernandez and the friend returned to their SUV and pulled over on a nearby street where Hernandez removed a revolver from the engine block, Haggan said. Hernandez began trailing Abreu, Furtado and three of their friends in his SUV, authorities said. He then pulled up to the victims' car at a red light and leaned out the driver's side window with a loaded revolver, Haggan told the court. Hernandez allegedly said, ""Yo, what's up now,"" followed by a racial slur, and fired at least five rounds from a .38-caliber revolver, Haggan said. Abreu, the driver, was shot several times and fatally hit in the chest.  Furtado was sitting in the front passenger seat and suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including one to the head, Haggan said. Hernandez was charged in the double homicide just last month, and he pleaded not guilty. Investigators found evidence they believe links him to the 2012 slayings while investigating an entirely different case -- the slaying of Odin Lloyd. Do tattoos provide clues? The killing of Odin Lloyd . In the early hours of June 17, 2013, Lloyd was shot seven times. The semi-pro football player's body was found by a jogger the next afternoon in an industrial park in North Attleboro, Massachusetts. Lloyd, who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee, had been partying with Hernandez just before his death, his friends told CNN. Lloyd's mother: 'Talking to my son in the ground' Prosecutors say Lloyd was last seen with Hernandez and Hernandez's two associates, Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace, around 2:30 a.m. in a rented silver Nissan Altima. Surveillance video from security cameras at an industrial park showed an Altima heading toward a secluded area at 3:22 a.m. At the same time, chilling text messages from Lloyd's phone were sent to his sister telling her he was with ""Nfl,"" adding, ""just so u know."" Between 3:23 and 3:27 a.m., workers nearby reported hearing gunshots. At 3:29, a camera showed an Altima pulling into Hernandez's driveway, about a half a mile from the death scene. Three people got out of the car, and Lloyd was not one of them. Nine days later, Hernandez was arrested and charged with first-degree murder and other weapon-related charges. He has pleaded not guilty. Investigators believe Hernandez's simmering anger over two incidents at a nightclub and his apartment led him to allegedly kill Lloyd two nights later, CNN has learned. One of the incidents involved Lloyd seeing guns and ammunition stored at Hernandez' so-called flop house, his apartment in Franklin, Massachusetts. The other thing that set off Hernandez was a conversation Lloyd had with two men at a club earlier that night, June 14, 2013, a source tells CNN. The cumulative effect apparently reached a breaking point for reasons that most people would find inconsequential. The source would not say what that was, but compared it to something as insignificant as the spilled drink that allegedly led to the 2012 Boston double slaying. Lloyd's killing did not involve possible knowledge of that double slaying as investigators previously considered, the source added. In April, Ortiz and Wallace were also charged in Lloyd's slaying.  They, too, have pleaded not guilty. Life in a jail cell . Today, Hernandez is behind bars in a 7-by-10 foot cell. Sheriff Thomas Hodgson, who runs the jail where Hernandez is incarcerated, says he has talked to inmate No. 174954 at length. Hernandez, Hodgson says, spends his time reading the Bible and another book he suggested, ""Tuesdays With Morrie."" Hernandez taken from jail cell and moved briefly to hospital . Hodgson has encouraged Hernandez to turn to his childhood anchor, his late father. The father-son relationship has come up in their conversations and could have played a role in his checkered past. ""His dad clearly kept him grounded,"" Hodgson said. ""When you lose that person and there's no one there to help you process it in a healthy way, at 16 you're going to reach out to anybody that's older than you to deal with it."" Even behind bars, Hernandez has found trouble. He has been accused of getting into a physical altercation with another inmate and is facing charges of assault and threatening a guard's life. That's on top of three murder charges, the lawsuit claiming he shot his friend in the face and three civil suits from the families of his alleged victims, among other things. New England Patriots added to wrongful death suit . As for the Lloyd case, Hernandez's lawyers contend the circumstantial evidence is full of gaps. ""There's certainly a lot of what I would call smoke. There's no doubt about it,"" defense lawyer Jamie Sultan said during a June 16 hearing. ""But that's not probable cause that he committed murder. And you can't just throw a bunch of stuff against the wall and say that's good enough."" No murder weapon has been found, and while at one point it seemed likely that Ortiz would be a key witness against Hernandez, there are now serious questions about his credibility. And the text Lloyd sent to his sister? The jury may never hear about it. ""I expect the defense to say that this is hearsay,"" legal analyst David Frank said. Hernandez's lawyers and mother declined to be interviewed, but both predict he will be cleared. It's a possibility that haunts Lloyd's loved ones. ""That's my biggest fear,"" Michael Branch, Lloyd's former coach and mentor, said. ""All it takes is one juror.""","Aaron Hernandez, former football star, is behind bars facing three murder charges .

"The escalating conflict in Ukraine ""essentially puts the nation on the brink of civil war,"" Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday. His assessment came during a telephone conversation with his German counterpart, according to the Kremlin, the same day Ukraine's military launched its first, formal military action against pro-Russian militants with troops retaking an airport in the eastern Donetsk region after a reported clash with gunmen. The military action came a day after a Ukrainian ultimatum expired for protesters to lay down their arms, a move that appeared to signal an escalation in the crisis that has sparked a diplomatic row between Ukraine, its Western allies and Russia. With pro-Russian militants seizing government and police buildings in as many as 10 towns and cities in eastern Ukraine, acting President Oleksandr Turchynov told Parliament ""an anti-terrorist operation"" was under way in the region. The aim of the military operation is to ""stop attempts to tear Ukraine to pieces,"" he told lawmakers. Witnesses reported hearing gunfire and aircraft that appeared to be coming from the airfield in Kramatorsk, which Turchynov's office said was under the control of Ukrainain special forces late Tuesday. There were conflicting reports about casualties, with Russian state-run media citing varying casualty claims supplied by militants. According to the reports, there were either two injured or four killed, claims that CNN cannot independently verify. Brink of civil war? Putin's comments followed similar ones hours earlier from Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev warned Ukraine was on a violent path. ""Ukraine is on the brink of civil war. It is scary. And I hope that everyone who is responsible for making decisions at the moment -- I mean both, the current Ukrainian authorities, who we can't consider legitimate, but these are the authorities who came to power as result of a coup -- has brains to avoid driving the country to such shocks,"" he said at a news conference Tuesday in Moscow. The pro-Russian uprising follows Russia's annexation last month of Ukraine's Crimea region, a move that emboldened other pro-Russian Ukrainians in the country's east to rise up. Russia has said it reserves the right to intervene to protect the rights of ethnic Russians in eastern Ukraine. During the conversation with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Putin also raised concerns about what he called an ""anti-constitutional course"" taken by Ukrainian authorities in Kiev to suppress protests. Despite what Merkel's office described as ""different assessments of the events on the ground in Ukraine,"" the focus of the conversation was on preparations for a meeting in Geneva among the foreign ministers of Russia, Ukraine, the United States and the European Union to find a way to reduce tensions in the region. In a sign of the divisions roiling the country, YouTube footage posted online appeared to show two openly pro-Russian presidential candidates who have demonstrated support for separatists being antagonized by crowds in separate incidents in Kiev on Monday night. In one video, Mikhail Dobkin, a presidential candidate for the Party of Regions, the party of ousted President Viktor Yanukovych, had flour and green liquid thrown at him as he addressed crowds. Another clip showed Oleg Tsarov, an independent candidate who was expelled from the Party of Regions, speaking to people without a shirt as he apparently sought to show the bruising he'd received from an aggressive crowd. In the third video, Tsarov tries to leave a TV station, where crowds shout ""Shame! Shame! Shame!"" His supporters and protesters end up in a brief scuffle. CNN has not been able independently to verify the amateur video clips. NATO, EU are 'deeply concerned' The escalating tensions in the region -- along with reports of violence -- have raised concerns among European Union defense ministers and NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who met Tuesday in Luxembourg. As he arrived for the talks, Rasmussen told reporters he was ""deeply concerned"" by the latest developments in Ukraine. ""I call on Russia to de-escalate the crisis, to pull back its troops from Ukraine's borders, to stop destabilizing the situation in Ukraine and make clear that it doesn't support the violent actions of pro-Russian separatists,"" he said. ""Russia should stop being part of the problem and start being part of the solution."" He said NATO and the EU are not discussing military options and that they support a diplomatic and political solution to the crisis. ""However, we are focused militarily on strengthening defense of our allies. That's our core task,"" he said. Ukraine deployed a National Guard battalion of 350 troops to the Donetsk region from Kiev on Tuesday morning, said Evgen Rojenyuk, a spokesman for Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council. The National Guard troops -- many of them former street protesters who signed up after the interim government took power in February -- have had only a few weeks of training. Military column . A CNN team in eastern Ukraine encountered a large Ukrainian military column traveling on roads leading from the city of Donetsk toward other towns in the region. The column included more than 20 armored personnel carriers, along with support vehicles, and a helicopter circled overhead. The troops, who were carrying the Ukrainian flag, appeared to be headed north and east, although their precise destination was unclear. The pro-Russian mayor of Slaviansk claimed Tuesday that a Ukrainian military convoy including troops and armored vehicles had now surrounded the town, Russian state news agency ITAR-Tass reported. ""If they try to move in, we will have to stop them,"" it quoted him as saying. Pro-Russian protesters seized a police building over the weekend in Slaviansk, some 100 miles from the border with Russia. From a hill overlooking the town, a CNN team saw no obvious signs of a large-scale operation, such as military helicopters or planes. Amid the unfolding crisis, Ukraine's most senior security and defense officials are to meet for a closed session with all members of Parliament on Wednesday morning, Turchynov said. Pretext for intervention? The unrest is the latest in a series of events ratcheting up tensions between Ukraine and Russia, which Kiev accuses of fomenting trouble in Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine. After then-Ukrainian leader Yanukovych backed out of a deal with the European Union in November in favor of closer ties with Russia, he was forced from office in February, the result of months of protests in Kiev. Distrust among the population in eastern Ukraine, the base of Yanukovych's power, grew as the new national government shifted rapidly in a pro-Western direction. A short time later, pro-Russian elements occupied the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, which Russia annexed in March. Since then, pro-Russian protesters have taken to the streets in eastern Ukraine and in some cases stormed and occupied buildings. Kiev's fragile new government and the West accuse Russia of destabilizing the region as a pretext to potentially send in troops to protect the local Russian-speaking population. NATO says Russian armed forces are massing on Ukraine's eastern border, while Moscow says they are merely carrying out military exercises. A United Nations human rights report released Tuesday on the situation in Ukraine cited an urgent need to counter ""misinformation, propaganda and incitement to hatred"" in the country to avoid the further escalation of tensions. ""Facts on the ground need to be established to help reduce the risk of radically different narratives being exploited for political ends,"" said U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay.

"It was long time waiting on standby but both the United Arab Emirates and Qatar did get what they were looking for; an upgrade to emerging market status from the more risky rating of frontier market. Investors cheered the news from the emerging markets index MSCI.  On yet another dismal day for emerging markets, Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Doha rallied again.  They have been stellar performers for the past year. Qatar: Tiny country making big power plays . At the same time, MSCI announced that a developed nation is being downgraded for the first time. Greece's fate was sealed by the 90% plunge of its stockmarket since the start of the financial crisis. It also failed to meet a number of criteria set out during a review which started a year ago. The UAE has been lobbying since 2008, so one could say the fifth year is a charm.  This process however required some fundamental changes to operations within the Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Doha financial markets. Read more: Qatar's inherent luxury . These changes included technical delivery and payment systems, liquidity requirements, sector diversification and a higher level of foreign ownership in listed companies. ""They have actually ticked a lot of boxes that previously were stopping the UAE and Qatar,"" according to Saleem Khokhar of National Bank of Abu Dhabi Asset Management. These are still small volume markets with turnover around $350 million a day, but that is a five-fold increase from where they were when applications came in. I have visited all three of the trading floors and it is not unusual to find a dozen traders on high quality, leather lounge chairs with their traditional white khanduras sipping tea while placing trades. It is an altogether different look and feel from New York, London or Tokyo, but money is being made. Dubai is up 70% in the past 12 months, Abu Dhabi 54% and Doha around 20%. Is Dubai the center of the world (again)? However this ""is absolutely not about the MSCI emerging market upgrade,"" Khokhar said. ""I would say it is more about the fundamentals."" But now that all three are part of this club, strategists say one should expect a knock on effect. HSBC has conducted an investment review predicting that the UAE could see capital flows increase by $370 million per year after the decision comes into place in 2014; Qatar rising by $430 million. According to MSCI, $1.5 trillion is earmarked by fund managers into emerging market assets. ""The move is a major sign of approval from institutional investors for the countries' stock markets, and is expected to attract more stable sources of capital to local equities,"" Kuwait's Global Investment House said in a note to investors after the decision. The UAE and Qatar seem far removed from the post-Arab spring countries, which are trying to find their economic footing, or Syria where a civil war prevails. Both are seeing capital flows coming into their countries in the form of tourism, trade and financial services.  These are safe havens of the Middle East.  In addition, there continues to be a substantial development spending.  In Abu Dhabi's case, $70 billion have been earmarked for the next five years alone.","UAE and Qatar got upgraded to emerging market status from the more risky frontier market rating .

"U.S. runner Nick Symmonds took a swipe at Russia's anti-gay propaganda law after winning a silver medal in the 800-meter competition at the World Track & Field Championships in Moscow, according to state-run media. Symmonds became the first athlete to openly criticize the law on Russian soil Tuesday when, after registering a time of one minute, 43.55 seconds, he dedicated his second-place finish to all his gay friends back home, RIA Novosti reported. ""As much as I can speak out about it, I believe that all humans deserve equality as however God made them,"" he told the news outlet  at Luzhniki Stadium. ""Whether you're gay, straight, black, white, we all deserve the same rights. If there's anything I can do to champion the cause and further it, I will, shy of getting arrested."" Symmonds, 29, who appeared in a February ad for the gender-equality group, NOH8, went on record with his sentiments earlier this month in a blog post for Runner's World magazine. In it, he flatly stated his support for LGBT rights -- and his disagreement with the Russian law -- but promised not to raise the subject in Russia because ""the playing field is not a place for politics."" ""I say this not out of fear of prosecution by the Russian government, but out of respect for the fact that I will be a guest in the host nation. Just as I would not accept a dinner invite to a friend's house and then lecture them on how to raise their kids, neither will I lecture the Russian government on how to govern their people,"" he wrote. CNN iReport: What it's like to be gay in Russia . Russia insists the law, which was signed in June and bans ""propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations around minors,"" is intended to protect children. It bars discussion of gay rights and relationships within earshot of children. International rights groups have called the legislation highly discriminatory, as anti-gay attacks are on the rise in Russia and are sometimes perpetrated by the police themselves. There have been widespread calls for boycotts and protests -- including a vodka-dumping demonstration in Los Angeles --  casting a pall over the 2014 Sochi Olympics. The gay rights group, All Out, has delivered a petition with hundreds of thousands of signatures denouncing Russia's stance on gay rights. The International Olympic Committee says it has ""received assurances from the highest level of government in Russia that the legislation will not affect those attending or taking part in the Games."" The committee told All Out representatives last week that it would pursue a stronger, written statement from the government, All Out spokesman Guillaume Bonnet said.","Nick Symmonds is first athlete to openly criticize anti-gay law on Russian soil .

"(CNN)Can anything stop Pep Guardiola's irresistible Bavarian machine? It doesn't look likely on this form. Five separate players scored as Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich thrashed a woeful Hamburg 8-0 at the Allianz Arena Saturday. Thomas Muller, Mario Gotze, Arjen Robben, Robert Lewandowski and Franck Ribery did the damage with Muller, Gotze and Robben each scoring twice. Bayern returns to Champions League action on Tuesday night against Shaktar Donetsk of the Ukraine but refused to rest up against its struggling northern opponents despite being three goals up at half time. The reigning German champions rolled in a further five goals after the break, maintaining its eight point lead atop the table over second placed Wolfsburg who were involved in a high scoring affair of an entirely different nature Saturday. A 93-minute goal from Bas Dost ensured Die Wolfe claimed a dramatic 5-4 victory over sixth-placed Bayer Leverkusen. The late strike was the Dutchman's fourth goal of a pulsating game in which Wolfsburg had led 3-0 at half time before being pegged back at 4-4 in the closing stages. Leverkusen's Heung-Min Sun also grabbed a hat-trick although the Korean's star-showing was somewhat overshadowed by Dost's match-winning heroics. In Saturday's other Bundesliga fixtures, Borussia Dortmund's mini-revival continued with a 4-2 victory at home to Mainz. The result lifts Jurgen Klopp's men up to 16th position and clear of the relegation and playoff places where it has found itself in recent weeks. There was no such joy for VFB Stuttgart, however, which remains rooted to the foot of the table after going down 2-1 to HGV Hoffenheim. Elsewhere, an injry-time header from Borussia Moenchengladbach's Granit Xhaka sealed a 1-0 win over regional rivals Cologne. However, the goal sparked scenes of anger among a group of Cologne fans dressed all in white who invaded the pitch and briefly clashed with police before order was restored.","Bayern Munich defeats Hamburg 8-0 .

"(CNN) -- Students unhappy with school meals are taking it out on the first lady by sharing images on social media of lunches sarcastically tagged #ThanksMichelleObama. Some of the images depict formless, mushy blobs on a lunch tray. Others show patties on whole-grain buns accompanied by an apple where one could imagine a pile of tater tots residing in earlier times. The complaints focus on taste, texture and portion sizes under new nutrition regulations promoted by the first lady. The standards were implemented as part of Obama's ""Let's Move!"" initiative to reduce childhood obesity. They took effect in 2012 with the goal of including more whole grains, vegetables and fruits in school meals while reducing fat and sodium. But students say the changes make the food unpalatable. ""I could understand how it might seem ungrateful if I got this lunch for free. But I don't,"" 17-year-old Hunter Whitney told CNN. ""I feel like many people would be upset too if the lunch they bought looked [like this]."" Backlash followed from others who said students were wrong to blame Michelle Obama for the quality of school meals. Instead, they suggested that students direct their grievances at local school districts -- or get their lunches from somewhere else. Whitney, who attends Richland Center High School in Wisconsin, said students deserve better options, especially those who can't leave school grounds during the day. ""Because my school has a closed campus, it's either bring your own, buy low-quality food you don't like, or go hungry.""","Sarcastic tweets blame Michelle Obama for unappetizing school meals .

"(CNN)A nervy Real Madrid returned to winning ways Saturday with a 2-0 victory over mid-table Deportivo la Coruna at the Santiago Bernabeu. Goals from Spanish international midfielder Isco and French striker Karim Benzema either side of half-time were enough to secure the three points, although Depor will feel aggrieved not to have taken anything from the game. The Gallicians put their more illustrious hosts under pressure for long spells and were unfortunate not to level matters at the beginning of the second period when midfielder Celso Borges cracked a post. Real goalkeeper Ilker Casillas then made a flying save from Oriol Riera moments later. After a 4-0 derby thrashing at the hands of city rivals Atletico Madrid last weekend, Real manager Carlo Ancelotti will be content to return to winning ways. However, the Italian will also be concerned at the often scrappy nature of his side's play and the relatively timid performance of star-man Cristiano Ronaldo who failed to score for his third La Liga game running -- the first time he has done so since 2013. Ronaldo came in for criticism from some Real supporters earlier in the week after holding his 30th birthday party in the wake of last Saturday's derby humiliation. The World player of the year did set up Benzema for Real's second and struck the bar in the first half, but he was quiet for long periods and missed from two-yards out when presented with a golden opportunity shortly before Isco opened the scoring. Speaking after the game, Ancelotti said ""It was a difficult week and we have come out of it with a victory which is good,"" in quotes carried by the AFP news agency . ""The team was a bit worried at the start, but in the end it went well. The fans have helped us and they understood the moment the team is going through to help us come out of this quickly."" Real and Ronaldo will be hoping for a more convincing performance when they face Schalke in the last 16 of the Champions League on Wednesday. Saturday's result moves Los Blancos four points clear atop the La Liga table although this will be cut back to one point if second placed Barcelona beats Levante at the Nou Camp Sunday. Round five of the FA Cup meant there was no Premier League action this weekend. There was, however, two all top-flight cup ties Saturday. West Brom comfortably overcame West Ham 4-0, thanks to a brace from the in-form Brown Ideye and further strikes from James Morrison and Saido Berahino, while Liverpool came from behind to defeat Crystal Palace 2-1 at Selhurst Park. In Saturday's other cup fixtures, Premier League Stoke City was thrashed 4-1 by second-tier Blackburn. Meanwhile, Nigeria striker Yakubu scored the winning goal as Reading defeated Derby County in an all Championship affair. An injury hit Paris Saint Germain missed the chance to go top of Ligue 1 after drawing 2-2 at home to Caen. The reigning French champions had forged ahead thanks to goals from Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Ezequiel Lavezzi but came undone when injuries forced Serge Aurier and Lucas off the park. Manager Laurent Blanc had used all three substitutions meaning PSG were forced to play the last 10 minutes with nine men. Although they held on for the majority of that time the Parisians conceded goals in the 89th and then 92nd minute to Emiliano Sala and Hervé Bazile respectively to ensure the spoils were shared. The result leaves PSG in third place behind Marseille, which drew with Stade Reims on Friday, and table-topping Lyon which heads to FC Lorient Sunday.","Real Madrid return to winning ways against Deportivo la Coruna .

"Stoning remains the way Iranians -- overwhelmingly women -- are punished for committing adultery, Human Rights Watch said Monday. The international group blasted a judicial council in Iraq, made up of 12 religious jurists, for inserting a stoning provision into a draft law where it had been previously removed. Last November, security agents with the country's judiciary moved the bodies of four women who had been stoned to the Tehran medical examiner's office, according to reports on the Melli-Mazhabi site, which opposed Iran's government, the U.S. State Department says. CNN cannot confirm the reports. According to the State Department's report, the unconfirmed accounts say the women's bodies had facial wounds that indicated torture, beatings and stoning. Officials denied the reports but did not provide alternative explanations for the causes of death, according to the State Department report, adding that the women were allegedly charged with engaging in ""illegitimate relationships"" and drug use. There are no statistics that indicate the number of stoning victims, but human rights groups say Iranian authorities are holding at least 10 women and men who face execution by stoning on adultery charges, Human Rights Watch says. At least 70 people have been executed by stoning in Iran since 1980, the rights group said, and the last known execution by stoning was in 2009. Iran's semiofficial Mehr News Agency reported on April 27, 2013, that the judicial group known as the Guardian Council had finished reviewing and amending the draft law and that the law would be implemented soon.

"Iran's new President Hassan Rouhani took the oath of office Sunday, replacing controversial President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Rouhani, 65, a cleric considered moderate, won the June elections with reformist backing. He campaigned on a ""hope and prudence"" platform in which he appealed to traditional conservatives and reform-minded voters alike. He pledged to improve the economy and unemployment. And as a former nuclear negotiator, he vowed to reduce the high tension between Iran and the outside world by addressing sanctions related to Iran's nuclear program. The White House congratulated Rouhani, and in a statement called his inauguration ""an opportunity"" for Iran to ""resolve the international community's deep concerns over Iran's nuclear program."" Should Iran decide to engage on the nuclear issue, the statement read ""it will find a willing partner in the United States."" Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, speaking at his weekly cabinet meeting, said the president of Iran may have changed, ""but the goal of the regime has not been replaced."" ""Iran's intention is to develop a nuclear capacity and nuclear weapons in order to destroy the State of Israel,"" he added. Iran insists its nuclear program is purely for civilian nuclear energy. Fast Facts: Hassan Rouhani . A former commander of the Iranian air defenses, Rouhani led three war and defense councils. He was national security adviser to the president for 13 years before Ahmadinejad took office. He has three law degrees, including a doctorate from a university in Scotland. As president of Iran's strategic research center, he regularly publishes essays. The Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is Iran's supreme leader. Rouhani will be a ""far more powerful president than Ahmadinejad would have ever dreamt -- or even, before him, anybody else,"" says Hamid Dabashi, a professor of Iranian studies and comparative literature at Columbia University. ""Because his revolutionary credentials are absolutely impeccable. He's very close to Khamenei"" and to the ""security and military establishment,"" Dabashi told CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS."" Still, he won't have the power to make a deal with the West on his own, says Dabashi. ""Iran is a very complicated regime consisting of security, intelligence, military and clerical establishments and a network."" Nazila Fathi, who was a New York Times correspondent in Tehran for 10 years, says Rouhani ""is not a reformist, even according to Iranian standards. He had backed the violent crackdown against the pro-democracy student movement in 1999 and never formally aligned himself with the reformist camp."" Also, it's not clear whether Khamenei's ""hard-line allies will allow Rouhani to introduce real change,"" Fathi, now with Harvard's Belfer Center, wrote in a column for CNN.com. ""The president sets the tone for domestic and foreign policy and can make room for more moderate voices in politics. But he holds little power compared with the authority that the constitution gives Khamenei. If Khamenei is willing to end international pressure over Iran's nuclear program, Rouhani provides the perfect opportunity."" Rouhani: Hawk or dove? Embracing a hard-liner label . When Ahmadinejad won the presidency of Iran in June 2005, he was a little-known mayor of Tehran. The son of a blacksmith assumed office billed as a hard-liner -- a label he embraced with rhetorical gusto. Two months into his term, in October, Ahmadinejad called for Israel to be ""wiped"" off the map, repeating a remark from a former ayatollah.  Years later, he told CNN, ""When we say 'to be wiped,' we say for occupation to be wiped off from this world."" Ahmadinejad speaks to CNN's Piers Morgan . Also in 2005, he declared the Holocaust a ""myth,"" prompting condemnation by the U.N. Security Council. Then, in April 2006, to a crowd of dignitaries, Ahmadinejad announced that ""Iran has joined countries with nuclear technology"" -- sparking the conflict that continues to this day. Economy sours . Ahmadinejad created a furor when he flew to New York to address the U.N. General Assembly on its opening day in September 2006. He took to the podium, defending his own nation's nuclear ambitions and decrying the nuclear records of other nations. The performance and the headlines that followed set a pattern that would repeat several times over the next seven years. Back home, Ahmadinejad's time in office was marked by crackdowns and a economic malaise. In 2009, he stood for re-election. Officially, he came out on top, but the result was disputed. Protesters filled the streets, and the Basij, a feared paramilitary group, cracked down. With thousands jailed and scores injured, Ahmadinejad pressed forward. But political protests weren't his only concerns. From Iranian rooftops, a view of protest and violence . Fast Facts: Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . Analyst: Ahmadinejad seeks to remain 'political force' Later, as the price of bread and other staples rose, people again people took to the streets. Ahmadinejad responded with riot police and finger pointing, putting the blame for the economic woes on international sanctions. While he was prevented from seeking a third term, he's unlikely to willingly give up being a ""political force"" in the country, says Geneive Abdo, an analyst with the Stimson Center and the Brookings Institution. While ""the odds seem stacked against"" him in that effort, Abdo wrote in a column for the CNN GPS blog, ""no one seems likely to convince the president to go quietly into the political wilderness.""","U.S. and Israel react to the swearing-in of Iran's new President Hassan Rouhani .

"Rivers overflowed their banks, mudslides buried houses and roadways flooded as fierce tropical storm systems hit opposite sides of Mexico, killing at least 21 people, an official said. State media reported one more death. At least 16 people were killed when Manuel, downgraded later to a tropical depression, hit the Pacific coastal state of Guerrero, including a group of six tourists from Mexico City who died in a highway accident Saturday as the storm struck, Mexico's state-run Notimex news agency said. And flooding and mudslides caused by Hurricane Ingrid's rains killed at least six people in the states of Hidalgo and Puebla, Notimex said. Three people were killed when rains swept away the vehicle they were riding in, Notimex said Saturday. And three others were killed when a mudslide buried a house. Luis Felipe Puente, from Mexico's civil protection agency, reported the 21 figure at a Sunday press conference. Another news conference is scheduled for Monday morning. Forecasters said the Category 1 hurricane, packing maximum sustained winds of 75 mph, is expected to make landfall Monday morning and could strengthen slightly before it hits. But even as Ingrid churned in the Gulf of Mexico, the storm system was already dumping heavy rains on parts of Mexico. Residents of Mexico's central state of San Luis Potosi felt the first signs of Ingrid's outer bands Saturday. Notimex reported damaged and collapsed roads and flooded homes. It said authorities evacuated residents in danger areas, taking them to one of more than 50 shelters in the region. Track Ingrid . Emergency crews distributed supplies in boats to areas unreachable by land. Riverside towns were stranded after the water rose to critical levels. The National Hurricane Center in the United States warned Ingrid could dump 10 to 15 inches of rain over Mexico's eastern region, with 25 inches expected in mountainous areas. The rainfall would mean flash floods and mudslides for saturated areas. Along the coast, the center predicted a ""dangerous storm surge"" and ""destructive waves.""

"The WITCH is back. Of course, if you're a computer historian, you already know that WITCH refers to the Wolverhampton Instrument for Teaching Computation from Harwell. If not, here's the story: The 2.5-ton machine, first constructed in the 1950s as part of an atomic research program, became the ""world's oldest original working digital computer"" after a museum in the UK restored and then rebooted it on Tuesday. Unlike today's nearly mute devices, the massive computer clicks, clacks and flashes like something out of an old sci-fi movie. ""In 1951 the Harwell Dekatron (the other, less-amazing name for the WITCH) was one of perhaps a dozen computers in the world, and since then it has led a charmed life surviving intact while its contemporaries were recycled or destroyed,"" Kevin Murrell, a trustee at the UK's National Museum of Computing, said in a news release. The computer outlived its usefulness in atomic research by 1957 and was used as a teaching device until 1973. It went on display briefly before being dismantled, the museum says, and then was ""rediscovered"" by volunteers at the museum in 2008 or 2009. The computer's ""flashing lights and clattering printers and readers provides an awe-inspiring display for visiting school groups and the general public keen to learn about our rich computer heritage,"" the museum says. It's also a healthy reminder that not all gadgets have to die after a single product cycle. At a time when iPhones are swapped out every 12 months, the TI-83 calculator and this computer are among the only pieces of technological machinery that have survived for decades. The WITCH, however, doesn't serve much of a practical purpose at this point. ""All together, the machine can store 90 numbers. The closest analogy is a man with a pocket calculator,"" Delwyn Holroyd, who led the restoration effort, tells the BBC in a video about the restoration (you should watch the video, by the way, if for no other reason that to see this thing in action; it sounds like a broken typewriter as it works). ""However, unlike the man with a pocket calculator, this machine can carry on day and night, and it doesn't make mistakes."" Modern computers store information in binary code, or a system of 1s and 0s. The WITCH, by contrast, features walls of dekatron valves, which are little light-bulb-looking things. It counts on a 10-digit decimal system. ""All told, the WITCH had 40 banks of 8 dekatrons, meaning it could store up to 40 8-digit numbers,"" Sebastian Anthony writes for the website ExtremeTech. ""The computational processes themselves, carried out by relays, was very slow -- somewhere on the order of 5 or 10 seconds to multiply two numbers."" Another drawback: The WITCH reads computer programs from paper tape with holes punched in it. The computer ""doesn't have a keyboard or a monitor like a modern machine,"" Holroyd explains in an ITV video. Perhaps the machine is so mesmerizing because, in a way, you can see how it works. Modern computers -- much less the Internet or smartphones -- are largely silent, glowing devices. They seem powered by wizardry. The WITCH, by contrast, is a clacking, blinking, ticking mess of mechanical parts. ""To see it in action is to watch the inner workings of a computer -- something that is impossible on the machines of today,"" Murrell, from the museum, says in the news release. ""The restoration has been in full public view and even before it was working again the interest from the public was enormous."" If you want to see the machine for yourself, it's on display at the National Museum of Computing in Buckinghamshire, north of London. It's located on the Bletchley Park estate, which was home to England's codebreakers during World War II.","The ""world's oldest original working digital computer"" gets a reboot .

"(CNN)Third-flight Bradford City claimed another English Premier League scalp to reach the quarterfinals of the FA Cup, football's oldest cup competition . Not content with coming from two goals down to stun Chelsea in the previous round, Bradford followed up Sunday with a 2-0 victory over Sunderland at Valley Parade. An early own goal from John O'Shea and a Jon Stead strike on the hour mark helped continue Bradford's fairytale cup run in a pulsating fifth round tie. Stead was scoring for the fifth straight round as the underdogs reached the last eight of the FA Cup for the first time since 1976 --  just  one win away from a semifinal and a return to the famous Wembley stadium. It is not the first time the Bantams, under the management of Phil Parkinson, have caused cup upsets against EPL opposition, reaching the final of the 2012-13 English League Cup before losing 5-0 to Swansea at Wembley. Bradford was then in the fourth-flight of English football and has since been promoted to the tier above, but still ranked 37 places below Sunderland. It did not show as Billy Clarke's third minute shot took a wicked deflection off former Manchester United star O'Shea to leave his side immediately on the backfoot. Sunderland finally woke up and manager Gus Poyet and his bench were furious when Steven Fletcher had penalty claims turned away after going down under Rory McArdle's challenge. England international Adam Johnson twice went close to an equalizer, but it was his defensive mistake that allowed Stead to score the crucial second goal. Later Sunday, Arsenal continued its defense of the FA Cup with a comfortable 2-0 home win over second-flight Middlesbrough as Olivier Giroud scored two goals in quick succession in the first half. The Gunners might have added to the tally after dominating the tie, but Boro, chasing promotion to the EPL, had an effort hit the woodwork in injury time. Aston Villa, with new manager Tim Sherwood in attendance, had a welcome distraction from its league woes with a 2-1 win over fellow EPL relegation candidates Leicester City. Saturday's action saw a shock 4-1 defeat for Stoke at Blackburn, while Liverpool, West Bromwich Albion and Reading also reached the quarterfinals. Louis Van Gaal's Manchester United will complete the fifth round action at third-tier Preston Monday. Messi hat-trick . In Spain, Lionel Messi marked his 300th La Liga appearance with a hat-trick as Barcelona beat Levante 5-0. It was his 23rd career triple in La Liga -- drawing him level with Cristiano Ronaldo -- and took him to 26 league goals for the season. The Nou Camp victory also leaves Barca a single point behind arch-rival Real Madrid in the title race with third-placed reigning champion Atletico Madrid staying seven points adrift with a shock 2-0 defea later Sunday against Celta Vigo. Brazil's Neymar had given the Catalan giants an early lead, connecting with a Messi cross as his mishit volley found its way into the net. Messi doubled the advantage just before halftime and took the game out of Levante's reach with his second on the hour mark. He completed his hat-trick from the penalty spot after Neymar had been fouled and Luis Suarez came off the bench to score a superb fifth.","Third-flight Bradford City beats EPL Sunderland in FA Cup .

"U.S. Special Forces parachuted overnight into Somalia from fixed-wing planes, then advanced on foot to a compound holding two kidnapped international aid workers and freed them, U.S. officials said Wednesday. The nine gunmen holding the hostages -- an American and a Dane -- were killed, the officials said. Jessica Buchanan, 32, and Poul Thisted, 60, had been held since October 25, when they were abducted in Galkayo, central Somalia, after they visited humanitarian projects, said the Danish Refugee Council, the agency for which they worked. Neither was harmed, the aid group said. They were taken to a regional medical facility, Pentagon spokesman George Little said Wednesday. ""They are not hospitalized,"" said Andreas Kamm, secretary-general of the Danish Refugee Council, so ""we take it as a sign that they're OK."" The pair phoned their families from the African nation of Djibouti after the rescue, said Ann Mary Olsen of the Danish Refugee Council, according to Danish TV2 reporter Thorkild Dahl. The Navy SEAL unit that killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden last year in Pakistan participated in the mission, a U.S. official said, without specifying whether any of the same individuals were on both assaults. Pentagon spokesman Little said the rescue team included special operations troops from different branches of the military but would not specify which branches. The SEALs are part of the Naval Special Warfare Development Group, formerly known as SEAL Team Six. The special forces troops took fire as they fought their way into a compound where the hostages were held, the official said, adding the troops believed that the kidnappers were shooting. The official is not authorized to speak to the media and asked not to be named. Nine gunmen were killed in the strike, Little said, adding that they had explosives nearby. There were no known survivors among the kidnappers, he added. The American assault team did not suffer any casualties, the Pentagon said. The special forces took the hostages from the compound and onto waiting helicopters, the U.S. official said. The United States was in close contact with Denmark before, during and after the raid, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said. White House spokesman Jay Carney, traveling Wednesday with President Barack Obama to Iowa, said the commander-in-chief learned of the success of the mission at 6:43 p.m. Tuesday, more than two hours before he delivered the State of the Union address. ""The decision to go ahead with this rescue mission was made because there was information concerning the deteriorating health of Ms. Buchanan, as well as a window of opportunity to execute this mission,"" Carney said. Obama, who had given the go-ahead at 9 p.m. Monday, was updated on its progress throughout Tuesday, Carney said. Minutes after concluding his speech, at 10:32 p.m., the president telephoned Buchanan's father to inform him of the mission's success, Carney said. John Buchanan told CNN he was ""flabbergasted"" when Obama called up out of the blue. ""He said, 'John, this is Barack Obama. I'm calling because I have great news for you. Your daughter has been rescued by our military.' ""Then he referred to his daughters, obviously had a human element there. Then he said something to the effect of, 'People just can't do this to our citizens, especially young people who are trying to help others.'"" ""I'm extremely proud and glad to be an American,"" Buchanan said. ""I didn't know this was going to transpire. I'm glad it did."" He said Jessica was ""doing well, under the circumstances."" Buchanan said he planned to fly Thursday to meet his daughter, but he could not say where that would take place. At his State of the Union address, before news broke of the rescue, Obama told Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, ""Leon, good job tonight. Good job tonight."" The hostages were safe at that point, but the mission was not yet complete as the American assault team had not departed Somalia, Little said. In a statement, Obama thanked the special operations forces for their ""extraordinary courage and capabilities."" ""The United States will not tolerate the abduction of our people, and will spare no effort to secure the safety of our citizens and to bring their captors to justice,"" Obama said. ""This is yet another message to the world that the United States of America will stand strongly against any threats to our people."" Panetta monitored the rescue from the White House, Little said. In a statement, Panetta called the raid ""a testament to the superb skills of courageous service members who risked their lives to save others."" Speaking on ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" Vice President Joe Biden said of the special forces: ""It just takes your breath away, their capacity and their bravery and their incredible timing."" Capt. John Kirby, another Pentagon spokesman, said the abductors were ordinary criminals. ""They were kidnappers. We don't have any indication that they were connected to any terrorist group or ideological group at that point,"" he said. ""They were not Al-Shabaab,"" Little said, referring to the al Qaeda-linked Islamist militia that holds sway over parts of Somalia. He said the sense of urgency with regard to the hostage situation had increased from mid-January. ""It's safe to say that within the last week or so, we were able to connect enough dots that we could make the decisions that were made,"" Kirby said, referring to the intelligence U.S. officials had to go on. The area where the hostages were seized is known as a hub for pirates, rather than an area of Islamic militant activity. A number of high-profile abductions of foreigners have occurred in Somalia and in Kenya, close to the largely lawless Somali border. Some of the kidnappings have been blamed on Al-Shabaab, while criminals seeking ransoms seem to have carried out others. In an exclusive interview with CNN, Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga congratulated the United States on the rescue and said he supported further U.S. and NATO action on the ground in Somalia. ""We would really like to see more concerted international effort in dealing with issues of international terrorism,"" he said. ""This action will send a very clearly signal to the Al-Shabaab that it doesn't matter how long they hold (their) hostages, the international community will continue to keep them on the radar."" Kenya sent troops over the border into Somalia in October to take on Al-Shabaab in response to abductions of aid workers and tourists. The U.S. raid comes nearly three years after Navy snipers killed three pirates who had taken hostage the captain of the Maersk Alabama off Somalia. U.S. forces did not coordinate the raid with local officials, but residents welcomed the outcome as a warning to other groups to cease the kidnapping of foreigners, said Abdirahman Mohamud Farole, president of Puntland, a semiautonomous region of Somalia. Thisted, the rescued Dane, is a senior aid worker, said Olsen of the Danish Refugee Council. Local authorities gave conflicting casualty figures after the raid. Some officials said seven gunmen were killed, but Mohamed Ahmed Aalin, president of Galmudug state, said nine were killed and five others detained by U.S. forces. The aid workers were part of the Danish Refugee Council's de-mining unit, which aims to make civilians safe from landmines and unexploded ordnance. ""We have been congratulated from all corners of the Somali society, and we have been told of celebrations in the the capital Mogadishu, in Galkayo and in the streets of Adado, where the local community has worked very hard to help Poul and Jessica,"" Olsen said. ""Their efforts have not been wasted."" Buchanan has been employed as a regional education adviser with the mine clearance unit of DRC since May; Thisted, a community safety manager with the de-mining unit, has been working in Somaliland and Somalia since June 2009.","U.S. State Department was in close contact with Denmark about the raid .

On Tuesday, his daughter Evin sent a statement to ""Access Hollywood"" standing up for Cosby. ""He is the FATHER you thought you knew. 'The Cosby Show' was my today's tv reality show,"" she wrote. ""Thank you. That's all I would like to say :)."" On a Facebook page reputed to belong to Evin Cosby, posts cheered her mother and questioned the accusers. CNN has not confirmed the page belongs to Evin Cosby. Over the last month, many women have come forward to accuse Cosby of past sexual assault;  the star has never been charged. The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said Tuesday it won't be charging Cosby with a crime in one of the alleged incidents that's emerged in the past month: the case of Judy Huth, a woman who recently sued Cosby, claiming he sexually molested her at the Playboy Mansion in 1974, when she was 15 years old. The statute of limitations for any possible misdemeanor or felony charge in the case has run out, the office said. Even without any charges filed, the accusations have caused Cosby's public persona to be damaged, resulting in lost projects and tour dates. How will we remember Bill Cosby? His camp has repeatedly and vigorously denied the allegations. It defies common sense that ""so many people would have said nothing, done nothing, and made no reports to law enforcement or asserted civil claims if they thought they had been assaulted over a span of so many years,"" said Cosby's attorney, Martin D. Singer, in a written statement sent to CNN. Cosby has said little, though Friday he told a freelance New York Post reporter that he appreciates his wife's strength, and offered expectations on how the media should cover the story.","Los Angeles prosecutor says Cosby won't be charged in 1974 case .

"A tiny spot on a precautionary ultrasound that former ""Good Morning America"" co-host Joan Lunden received after getting an all-clear on her annual mammogram was the first sign of trouble. A biopsy was taken. ""I knew the minute the doctor walked in the office,"" Lunden told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in an interview. ""You could just tell by her demeanor. She said, 'you definitely have breast cancer.'"" Lunden, who co-hosted ""GMA"" from 1980 to 1997 and promotes health and wellness for women, said she ""jumped into action,"" immediately consulted specialists and sought other opinions before starting with chemotherapy. ""When I heard those words -- it doesn't make any difference if you're a doctor -- those are scary words and they're shocking,"" Lunden said. Doctors earlier this month discovered two small tumors in her right breast, she said. It was triple negative breast cancer, a rare and aggressive form that occurs more often in younger women and African-American or Hispanic women. ""This is kind of subset,"" she said. ""One thing I learned is that breast cancer, you think of it as one thing. Every woman has a different kind of breast cancer as far as how the pathology comes out, where it is. And you really need to get a lot of opinions."" On Tuesday, Lunden, 63, first revealed her recent diagnosis to fans via Twitter and a letter on her website JoanLunden.com. She considered keeping the news private. What would she say to her 9- and 11-year-old twins? She thought herself somehow exempt from all this? ""I was scared that people would think I let them down,"" she said. ""In the first two days or so, I just wanted to go away somewhere and not let anybody find out. I also felt like I didn't want to tell the kids because my younger kids would be worried. We were advised by everyone that that was really a mistake."" Lunden recently offered her first TV interview about having the disease to current ""GMA"" co-host and breast-cancer survivor Robin Roberts, who advised her on dealing with her hair loss and other issues. ""GMA"" co-host Amy Robach is currently being treated for breast cancer. Lunden told CNN that she decided to shave her hair before losing it to chemotherapy, enabling her to ""stay in an empowered position instead of  woe-is-me patient position."" ""When it starts to go, it's shocking, embarrassing and depressing,"" she said she learned of the hair loss. ""Preempt it. Get it shaved off. I did that. And I thought it was going to be like the biggest deal in the world. And you know what? I felt I didn't have it done to me. I walked in and I said, 'Do this.'"" After consulting doctors, Lunden said, she decided on therapy aimed at reducing the size of a tumor with chemotherapy, a lumpectomy to remove the cancer, followed by radiation therapy. ""What I say I'm doing doesn't mean that's what you should be doing,"" she said. ""Every woman's breast cancer is different."" Lunden said her tumor was picked up after an ultrasound, which is used for women who have dense fibrous breast tissue where cancers are not always detectible on mammograms. Lunden, whose late father was a cancer surgeon, said she had no symptoms before her diagnosis or family history of cancer. ""Most women do not have any symptoms before they're diagnosed with breast cancer,"" Dr. Valerie Montgomery-Rice, dean of the Morehouse School of Medicine, told CNN.

"A lethal combination of worn aircraft parts and unprecedented speed caused last year's Reno Air Races crash, which killed a veteran pilot and 10 spectators, and injured more than 60 others, federal accident investigators concluded Monday. The main culprits, according to the National Transportation Safety Board, were several lock nuts on the left trim tab -- an aerodynamic surface on the horizontal part of the plane's tail -- nuts that had not been replaced in at least 26 years. The worn nuts allowed screws to loosen -- possibly years ago, without apparent consequence, the NTSB said.  But when pilot Jimmy Leeward pushed the highly modified P-51 Mustang to a speed of 445 knots -- 35 knots faster than it had ever flown before on the Nevada race course -- the flaw caused flutter vibrations in the plane's trim tabs. The plane pitched up at about 17 Gs of acceleration, incapacitating Leeward. Reno air race organizers hope to continue race after deadly crash . The plane rolled, plunged towards the ground and slammed into a box seating area, showering the area with debris. When the incident happened last September, it threatened to bring an end to the National Championship Air Races in Reno, the only race of its kind in the nation. But organizers have compiled a complete schedule of races from September 12 through 16, saying they have made numerous safety improvements recommended by the NTSB. Among the improvements: race planes will be required to demonstrate their airworthiness at racing speeds before participating in races, spectators will be seated further from the aerial race course and the Reno Air Races has ""flattened"" the tight turn where last year's accident occurred. ""Pilots know that they are taking risks, but air race pilots expect that the risks taken are theirs alone,"" said NTSB Chairman Deborah A.P. Hersman. ""The spectators assumed that their safety had been assessed and addressed."" Hersman said the NTSB made its recommendations in April to give the Reno Air Racing Association time to implement the changes for this year's race. The NTSB said major modifications to the aircraft, intended to make the plane faster, contributed to the accident. Its 37-foot wingspan had been reduced to 29 feet. Some of the changes were undocumented and had a detrimental effect on the World War II-era aircraft, which was known as ""The Galloping Ghost."" For instance, investigators said, the plane's right trim tab -- a piece of the tail -- was locked in position aligned with the tail. Pilot overwhelmed by g-forces in Reno crash . ""On this airplane, you should have both trim tabs,"" investigators said. ""This pilot put a screw through there to fix it in position, and when you do that, he lost redundancy. You have put all the eggs in the basket of hoping the left elevator will not fail. And it did fail."" Leeward's age, 74, was not found to be a factor in the crash. The 17 g forces that resulted from the failure greatly exceeded human tolerances, the NTSB said.  It is difficult for trained pilots to remain conscious with even 5 Gs, the NTSB has said. The accident investigation was greatly aided by numerous movies and photographs by spectators, according to the NTSB. Since the accident, several victims and family members have filed suit, one alleging that the crash was not a ""freak accident,"" but was ""the predictable result of a reckless drive for speed by a risk taking pilot and crew, coupled with an insatiable drive for profit"" by race organizers. The Reno racing association, meanwhile, announced last week it has set up a $77 million fund to compensate victims or heirs. The program is being administered by Kenneth Feinberg who administered funds for victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the BP Deepwater Horizon disaster. The Reno crash focused attention on the dangers of air races and air shows. In addition to the 11 people killed at the Reno races, five performers died at air shows elsewhere last year. Federal regulators and air show organizers vouch for the safety of the system, saying rules for U.S. air shows are stricter than those in other countries.

"Mr. Harvey would be so proud today. His voice -- the magnificent voice that he feared he had lost forever -- is back. And people all over the United States are once again moved by the sound of it, and by his words. ""And on the eighth day, God looked down on his planned paradise and said 'I need a caretaker.'  So God made a farmer."" Just as seemingly simple, and devastatingly direct, as that. ""God said 'I need somebody willing to sit up all night with a newborn colt, and watch it die, then dry his eyes and say, 'Maybe next year.' "" You probably saw the commercial during the Super Bowl telecast.  It was on behalf of a Dodge truck.  The voice was that of Paul Harvey, taken directly from a recording of a speech he made in 1978 to the Future Farmers of America. Mr. Harvey died four years ago at the age of 90. I knew him for more than 30 years; he always invited me to call him ""Paul,"" and I never quite could.  He was Mr. Harvey, and for a very long time, he was as big a name as there was in the world of radio.  His commentaries were heard everywhere. Eatocracy: By the numbers, how has farming changed since 'So God Made a Farmer'? They were so popular because he was unafraid, even in the most cynical and contentious times, to speak from his heart.  Because of that, he had admiring listeners of every political persuasion; his own politics were conservative, but because of the care and craftsmanship with which he wrote, people who didn't agree with him on issues of national policy made a daily habit of tuning in just because they liked the warmth and respect he showed them in his storytelling.  They considered his voice to be the voice of a friend. ""God said, 'I need somebody strong enough to clear trees and heave bales, yet gentle enough to yean lambs and wean pigs and tend to pink combed pullets; who will stop his mower for an hour to splint the broken leg of a meadowlark.'"" The writing was what he took such pride in. He would begin well before dawn, in a quiet office above Michigan Avenue in Chicago.  He wrote on a favorite old typewriter whose touch he trusted.  Within the hour, the words -- punctuated by those wondrous silences between phrases -- would be heard in every corner of the country. They connected, person-to-person, with the intimacy of a whisper in an ear. Truck ad stirs pride, passion and conversation in agricultural circles . Toward the end, illness ravaged his voice, and he was terrified that it had been irretrievably stolen from him.  He was off the air for long spans. When he came back, the voice was still his, but it was weakened.  He knew it.  The knowledge caused him great despair. He had two best friends in life. One was his wife, Angel, who died before he did. The other best friend was his voice. The thought of it, too, being taken from him made Mr. Harvey lie awake at night and pray. There that voice was again, Sunday night. People too young to remember Mr. Harvey's glory days stopped what they were doing and leaned toward the television set, suddenly needing to hear every word. His artistry did that to people. ""Somebody who would bale a family together with the soft, strong bonds of sharing; who would laugh and then sigh, and then reply, with smiling eyes, when his son says that he wants to spend his life doing what dad does -- 'so God made a farmer.' "" Mr. Harvey would walk out of the studio after each broadcast, then go back into his office and sit down next to that typewriter. He knew that soon enough he'd be at it again.","Bob Greene: Americans of all political stripes listened to Paul Harvey's radio stories .

"Hillary Clinton did not comment on the Keystone XL pipeline Monday while speaking before a conservation group that is strongly opposed to the plan. During a 15-minute speech, Clinton spoke about the importance of green technology, the problems surrounding natural gas drilling and the fact that climate change exists and needs to be addressed more forcefully. But at no point did Clinton address the 1,179-mile-long project that would move oil from Canada to refineries in the United States at the League of Conservation Voters' New York dinner. ""There is no getting around the fact that the kind of ambitious response to effectively combat climate change is going to be a tough sell at home and around the world at a time when so many counties ... are grappling with slow growth and stretched budgets,"" Clinton said at the dinner. ""Our economy still runs primarily on fossil fuels and trying to change that will take strong leadership."" Clinton also went after climate change deniers during the speech by noting sea levels are rising, ice caps are melting and storms are getting stronger. ""We do not have to choose between a healthy environment and a healthy economy,"" she added. Clinton's refusal to comment on the pipeline is not new. The former secretary of state has repeatedly dodged the Keystone question and gave the issue zero mentions in her 2014 memoir. Clinton usually tells interested audiences -- usually groups in Canada or at environmental events -- that she doesn't want to comment on an issue currently in the hands of her successor, Secretary of State John Kerry. But Keystone appears to be one of the only issues where Clinton follows that rule. The former first lady regularly comments on other issues currently on Kerry's plate, like Syria, the ongoing conflict with ISIS and talk over nuclear weapons with Iran. Both Republicans and Democrats have faulted Clinton for not commenting on the issue. America Rising, an anti-Clinton super PAC, has made the issue one of their most used recent attacks on Clinton, while liberal groups have pushed Clinton for specifics on her pipeline position. Gene Karpinski, president of the conservation group, said he wasn't disappointed that Clinton didn't mention Keystone, primarily because he knows she doesn't comment. ""She has already been asked about that. That is not her decision right now,"" Karpinski said. ""You heard her praise President Obama many, many times for his leadership on climate change and leaving a legacy. That is a decision left to him and the current secretary of state. That is where it should be."" The League of Conservation Voters has been pointedly against the pipeline for years and regularly urges supporters to call members of Congress and petition their government to kill the pipeline. That said, Karpinski would not rule out backing a candidate who supports the pipeline and points to a few pro-pipeline senators the league backed in 2014. RELATED: Senate rejects GOP measure to build oil pipeline . Clinton's silence on Keystone was made more interesting given the fact that before her speech, the former senator from New York stumped for Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana at a New York fundraiser. Landrieu, a moderate Democrat who has been one of the pipeline's most outspoken proponents, is currently behind in a runoff race for her Senate seat. In a way to win voters, Landrieu forced a vote on the pipeline in the Senate earlier this month. Though Landrieu voted in favor, many from her party did not and the bill failed by one vote. Karpinski said he did not find it odd that Clinton stumped for Landrieu - a candidate the league did not back - before speaking to his group. ""There is nothing surprising about that at all,"" he said. ""Many of our best friends in the Senate have done similar things. ... It is just what people do."" After Clinton's speech, she sat with a number of top environmental activists, including Tom Steyer, a Keystone opponent and big Democratic donor. Questions about Clinton's position on Keystone are not likely to abate soon. Earlier on Monday, organizers announced Clinton would speak at two events in Canada on January 21 where Keystone is likely going to be addressed.","Hillary Clinton took a pass at addressing the Keystone XL pipeline project before a pro-environment group Monday .

"YouTube comments are rough. They dabble in all forms of trolling, bullying, racism, sexism and other offensive -isms, interspersed with endless spurts of nonsensical chatter. Any thoughtful comments are typically lost in a roiling sea of ""LOLs,"" insults and spam. Thousands of these comments can follow a popular video, in order of when they were posted but with a handful of the most upvoted comments on top. ""If some of these comments were spray-painted on homes, buildings or at schools, there would be consequences. But online there are almost none,"" said Benny and Rafi Fine, the filmmakers behind the popular Fine Brothers YouTube channel. Now YouTube has a new plan to pull its infamous comments out of the muck and make them more constructive and personalized. ""When it comes to the conversations happening on YouTube, recent does not necessarily mean relevant. So, comments will soon become conversations that matter to you,"" said the company in a blog post. ""In the coming months, comments from people you care about will rise up where you can see them, while new tools will help video creators moderate conversations for welcome and unwelcome voices."" Since YouTube is a Google property, it will start by integrating its existing commenting system into Google+, the identification platform and social network Google has been tirelessly trying to make happen since 2011. YouTube commenters will now have to tie their current accounts to a Google+ account. 'Don't feed the trolls': Racism on YouTube . The first major difference is that relevant comments will now automatically float to the top. If the maker of a video posts something in the comments, or even just on their Google+ page, it will automatically be highlighted and placed right under the video. The new system also will automatically surface comments from popular personalities and quality threaded discussions. ""We're moving from comments to actual conversations,"" said YouTube product manager Nundu Janakiram, who compared the new nested comments to a conversation in Gmail. YouTube also is using Google+ to customize what each person sees based on who their friends are and which other commenters they interact with the most. Conversations can be made private, so you and your three best friends can analyze the latest Beyoncé video on YouTube without anyone else seeing. The site's final new weapon is a collection of powerful comment-screening tools for video creators. There are new filters that will  automatically show comments from approved users or entire Google+ circles and never show comments from blocked users. Content creators can make a blacklist of any offending words or phrases they don't want appearing in comments under their videos, and all comments that dare use said words will be held for review. ""This new feature will allow us to prevent the disturbing comments from ever appearing versus having to moderate every single comment that comes in, so it has the potential to be a huge positive for our company,"" said the Fine Brothers. Of course, the problem of nasty comments is not unique to YouTube. It can be found to differing degrees in any online commenting system, especially where there's anonymity. Video creators say these types of comment controls are long overdue on all sharing and social media sites. Previously, if a YouTube thread got out of hand the best option was to turn off comments. But this can be especially tricky for children's content, such as the Fine Brothers' ""Kids React"" series. ""Cyberbullying and hate speech in the YouTube comments have been a major issue for far too long,"" said Benny and Rafi Fine. ""Across nearly every video on the site involving race or young children, the uploader has always been pushed into a corner to have to turn comments off entirely or ... (screen them) to not let such horrible hatred come through."" While some commenters on websites are truly racist or sexist, others are ""trolls"" who say hateful things just to incite a reaction from others for their own amusement. YouTube recognizes that the new changes won't eliminate trolls completely because many people are more than willing to say horrible things under their real names, and anonymity is still an option in the new commenting system. YouTube says the majority of YouTube commenter accounts are already linked to Google+ identities, which should minimize backlash. Anonymity is important for many YouTube users, such as political dissidents around the world who fear reprisals by their governments. To keep people protected, Google will not force them to post under their real names. And anyone can choose to continue posting under their current YouTube handle. To test the waters, YouTube will roll out the commenting system on channel discussion pages this week. It will show up on all videos in the coming months. For anyone who prefers the current system, there's still an option to view all comments in chronological order.","YouTube is trying to fix its comments with a new system that ties all accounts to Google+ .

"FIFA will give greater prominence to the human rights record of countries bidding to host future World Cups, a senior official told the European Parliament Thursday. Theo Zwanziger, an executive committee member of football's world governing body, was giving evidence  on the welfare conditions of migrant workers involved in construction projects for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. ""The Qatar authorities realize they cannot continue with business as usual,"" he told the human rights panel of the parliament in Brussels. ""The country needs to think in general about the welfare of workers,"" he said. ""Everyone should do something to improve the appalling situation, not just FIFA,"" he added. On Tuesday, World Cup organizers in Dubai, who had been set a deadline by FIFA, unveiled an updated 'workers' charter' -- which pledged to address concerns over wages and accommodation for overseas workers and pledged regular inspections of construction sites. Critics claimed it did not go far enough, but FIFA told CNN Thursday that it was an important first step. ""We welcome the concrete steps taken which were announced by the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy to ensure the welfare of workers for the 2022 FIFA World Cup,"" said a spokesperson. ""FIFA is pleased with the commitment of the local organizers to use the hosting of the FIFA World Cup to accelerate adequate uniform working standards in Qatar,"" it added. In his evidence to the parliament, Zwanziger also acknowledged that with the global spotlight falling on the Gulf state there was ""a risk and a chance... it can help improve the human rights situation."" But Zwanziger conceded that when the decision was made to award Qatar the 2022 competition its record on human rights had not sufficiently been taken into account. ""We need to rethink this and give human rights a much higher status,"" he said. Other speakers addressing the parliament highlighted Qatar's kafala system -- which allows employers to withhold pay and prevent overseas workers from leaving the country by withholding their passport. Sharan Burrow, head of the International Trade Union Confederation wanted kafala to be ended immediately. ""Qatar is a slave state for 1.4 million migrant workers,"" she said. ""Workers live in squalor, and are forced to work under extreme conditions, in extraordinary heat; they don't have enough drinking water. They don't have a normal weekend, are kept apart from other workers, and there's no proper health care."" Zahir Belounis, the French-Algerian footballer, who was unable to leave Qatar for several months last year after a contractual wrangle with his club, also gave an emotional testimony before the parliament about his experiences. Last November, European MEPs passed a resolution which called on the ""Qatari authorities to stop detaining individuals for 'running away' from their employers,"" and demanded ""working conditions that are in line with international human rights standards."" It followed a hard-hitting report from Amnesty International on conditions for migrant construction workers, who are involved in the estimated $200B infrastructure projects associated with the World Cup. FIFA president Sepp Blatter responded to the report by saying the situation was ""unacceptable"" before giving Zwanziger responsibility for heading up an investigation.","FIFA: Human rights situation in Qatar 'appalling'

"Georgia authorities have arrested 14 people they accuse of traveling with the intent to have sex with children, including a suburban Atlanta elementary school principal, according to CNN affiliates and school system officials. ""I was notified (Sunday) that Mt. Carmel Elementary School Principal John McGill was arrested this weekend and is under investigation,"" said Douglas County School Superintendent Gordon Pritz. McGill has been suspended pending the state investigation, and the school system is cooperating with police, he said. The principal was released on a $50,000 bond Tuesday and was told to have no contact with minors unless they were family members -- and those visits must be supervised -- and to not use the Internet for pornography, his attorney, Mac Pilgrim, said. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation's sting targeted ""persons who communicate with children on-line and then travel to meet them for the purpose of having sex,"" a news release said. It continued, ""Online child predators visit chat rooms and websites on the Internet, find children, begin conversations with them, introduce sexual content and arrange a meeting with the children for the purpose for having sex."" Before taking the job at Mt. Carmel, McGill was the principal at two other schools -- one in the Douglas County system, the other out of state, said county schools spokeswoman Karen Stroud. McGill has worked for the county since 2004, she said. The principal was arrested Sunday and charged with electronic pornography and violation of the Child Exploitation Prevention Act of 1999, the GBI said. Pilgrim said his client's cell phone was confiscated as evidence when he was arrested. Pilgrim said Monday he had spoken to McGill's wife, but not McGill, so he couldn't say how he intended to plead in the case. The GBI says that McGill and 13 others were arrested over a four-day period as part of Operation Broken Heart, a sting involving 37 local, state and federal law enforcement agencies. ""The operation took months of planning. The arrestees, ranging in age from 21 to 64, traveled from all parts of northern Georgia with the intent to meet a child for sex. Some of their occupations included educator, engineer, laborer, salesman, business owner, software developer, and a musician,"" a GBI news release said.

"FIFA approved tougher penalties for racist behavior, including possible relegation, in a move that one anti-racism organization said will bring soccer ""in line"" with other sports. The sanctions, FIFA revealed at its congress in Mauritius on Friday, come in two stages. They were initiated at a time when incidents of racism continue to make headlines around the world and several months after FIFA set up an anti-racism task force. Punishments for first offenses bring a warning, fine or clubs being forced to play games in empty stadiums. A second offense, or one deemed ""serious,"" could result in demotion, a deduction of points or expulsion from a tournament. Soccer's global governing body also said that any individual committing a racist infraction should be suspended for at least five matches. It's now up to FIFA's member associations, who number more than 200, to implement the new punishments. Only one member -- it wasn't known which one -- voted against the measures. ""There have been despicable events this year that have cast a long shadow over football and the rest of society,"" FIFA president Sepp Blatter said. ""I am speaking of the politics of hate -- racism, ignorance, discrimination, intolerance, small-minded prejudice, that uncivilized, immoral and self-destructive force that we all detest."" Kevin-Prince Boateng of A.C. Milan walked off in protest when he was racially abused during a friendly in January, and Greece's football federation banned AEK Athens' Giorgos Katidis for five games in April and fined him for a Nazi-style goal celebration. Kick It Out, the anti-racist body, welcomed Friday's development. ""It is something the organization has been campaigning on, and stricter punishments for discrimination more generally, for many years,"" chair Lord Herman Ouseley said on Kick It Out's Web site. ""We hope to see the practical implications of this ruling. ""FIFA is setting an example to bring football in line with other sports which don't have problems around discrimination and unacceptable behavior."" Meanwhile, FIFA announced three women would take their place on the executive committee, which votes, for instance, on where the World Cup is held.","FIFA takes a tougher stance on racist behavior, as one punishment could be relegation .

"Rival Libyan militias battled for Tripoli International Airport on Sunday, leaving nine people dead and 25 others wounded, the government said. Shelling was threatening civilians as violence stretched along the airport road, which is dotted with residential neighborhoods. All flights in and out of the airport have been suspended. CNN personnel could hear gunfire and blasts throughout the day.  Heavy smoke billowed above the airport. While the government issued a statement calling for calm, Libya's government is weak and militias outnumber and outgun its security forces. Many of the armed groups are on the state's payroll. These circumstances make it very difficult for the government to gain control over this latest increasingly volatile and violent situation. State-run al-Rasmiya television gave the death toll, citing Libya's Health Ministry. Brigades from the Zintan militia have controlled the airport since the Libyan civil war in 2011. Other militias have tried to wrest control of the airport from the Zintan brigades for years. Armed vehicles gathered in the area overnight before fighting broke out around dawn Sunday, witnesses said. ""The revolutionary brigades are inside Tripoli International Airport,"" the Libyan Revolutionaries Operations Room, an Islamist militia in the capital, posted on its Facebook page. ""The revolutionary forces have reached the perimeter of Tripoli International Airport ... clashes with some of the armed groups present there,"" the group said. State-owned Afriqiyah Airways said on its official Facebook page that it was diverting some of its international arrivals to the city of Misrata, and that the airport in Tripoli would be closed until July 17. Late Sunday morning, the sounds of fighting could also be heard in the vicinity of a Zintan base in a western suburb of Tripoli. Libya's interim government released a statement Sunday that said regional brigades and ""field commanders"" are carrying out ""operations,"" and they moved on Tripoli Airport with ""no order or legitimate cover, coming from different directions ..."" The government is in talks with what the statement called the international community so that lives and ""vital installations"" are protected. Stop ""these acts of war,"" the statement implored. A state of emergency in all hospitals and clinics was issued. Hugh Robertson, the United Kingdom's minister for the Middle East, urges an immediate end to violence at Tripoli International Airport. Robertson said the violence was ""putting the lives of people in the area in grave danger. ""We urge all sides to cease violence immediately and to engage in meaningful dialogue,"" he said. In a statement the night before the fighting erupted, the U.S. State Department expressed concern about what it said was the ""ongoing violence in Libya and dangerous posturing that could lead to widespread conflict there."" The U.S. renewed its calls for national dialogue in Libya. Even though Libyans successfully toppled the 42-year rule of Moammar Gadhafi in 2011, the country is far from stable. Armed militias are now the biggest challenge. The international community has largely agreed that the key to resolving Libya's crisis is national dialogue. But a weak central government -- combined with militias split along regional, tribal and ideological lines -- has added to the challenge. ""The United States is deeply concerned by the ongoing violence in Libya and dangerous posturing that could lead to widespread conflict there,"" the State Department said in a statement Saturday. ""We affirm our support for Libya's democratic transition and urge the seating of the new Council of Representatives as soon as possible,"" the statement added. ""Finally, we stress the vital role Libya's Constitution Drafting Assembly plays in building the new country for which Libyans sacrificed so much during the revolution.""","National airline announces airport will be closed until July 17 .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A series of explosions tore through an open-air market in the capital of the volatile western Chinese region of Xinjiang on Thursday, killing dozens of people and wounding many more, state media reported. China's Ministry of Public Security said the attack in the heavily policed city of Urumqi was ""a serious violent terrorist incident"" and vowed to crack down on its perpetrators. President Xi Jinping called for the terrorists behind it to be ""severely"" punished. Two SUVs slammed into shoppers gathered at the market in Urumqi at 7:50 a.m. Thursday, and explosives were flung out of the vehicles, China's official news agency Xinhua said. The vehicles then exploded, according to Xinhua, which said at least 31 people were killed and more than 90 wounded. Some of the photos circulating on social media suggested a hellish scene, with bodies strewn on the ground amid burning wreckage. Others showed flames and smoke billowing out of the end of a tree-lined street guarded by police officers. 'An enormous sound' ""I heard an enormous sound, then I looked out from my balcony,"" said a resident of a building near the explosion who would only give his surname, Shan. He told CNN that trees obscured much of his view of the scene, but that he ""could see there was chaos, with people injured."" Many of the victims caught in the blasts were elderly people who regularly visited the morning market, Xinhua reported. ""It's mainly people coming to trade vegetables, especially the elderly who get up early and buy vegetables to cook,"" Shan said. The U.S. government condemned the attack. ""This is a despicable and outrageous act of violence against innocent civilians, and the United States resolutely opposes all forms of terrorism,"" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said in a statement. String of recent attacks . Chinese authorities have stepped up security measures in Xinjiang in recent months amid a series of attacks within the region and in major Chinese cities outside it. On Wednesday, the day before the blasts, Xinhua reported that 39 people had been sentenced to prison in the past two months for ""inciting violence"" in Xinjiang. But the devastating blasts Thursday suggest the government is facing a foe determined to wreak havoc. Thursday's attack at the market comes less than a month after an explosion hit a train station in Urumqi, killing three people and wounding 79 others. That blast took place on April 30, just after Xi had wrapped up a visit to the region. Ethnic tensions . Chinese officials have linked a mass knife attack in March that killed 29 people at a train station in the southwestern city of Kunming to Islamic separatists from Xinjiang. They have also blamed separatists for an attack in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in October in which a car rammed into a pedestrian bridge and burst into flames, killing two tourists and the three occupants of the vehicle. The knife-wielding assailants in the Kunming attack and the people in the car that hit Tiananmen were identified as Uyghurs, a Turkic-speaking, predominantly Muslim ethnic group from Xinjiang. Ethnic tensions between Uyghurs and Han Chinese people, millions of whom have migrated to resource-rich Xinjiang in recent decades, have repeatedly boiled over into deadly riots and clashes with authorities in recent years. Some Uyghurs have expressed resentment over harsh treatment from Chinese security forces and Han people taking the lion's share of economic opportunities in Xinjiang. The Han are the predominant ethnic group in China, making up more than 90% of the overall population. Shift in target . The pattern of ethnic violence in the region goes back decades, according to James Leibold, an expert in ethnic relations in China at La Trobe University in Melbourne. ""But what's new, and what I think is significant, is that we have a shift in target,"" Leibold said. ""We have a targeting of innocent civilians, places where innocent civilians gather -- an attempt to maim innocent civilians in large numbers."" The other change is that the violence has ""seeped outside"" the borders of Xinjiang into other parts of China, he said. It remains unclear who exactly is behind the high-profile attacks in recent months. Chinese officials have pointed to a murky separatist group, the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), which they have blamed for violent acts in the past. East Turkestan is the name used by many Uyghur groups to refer to Xinjiang. But analysts are divided about the extent of the ETIM's activities and its links to global terrorist networks like al Qaeda. ""Generally, the government response is to blame terrorists without providing many details,"" Leibold said. ""So I suspect it's going to be very difficult to get to the bottom of this incident like previous ones.""

"Brazil's preparations for the 2014 World Cup suffered a setback Wednesday after a judge asked for the immediate suspension of construction at a host venue for the prestigious soccer tournament due to safety concerns. The Arena de Baixada, also known as Estadio Joaquim Américo Guimarães, is in the city of Curitiba. The stadium is scheduled to host four group stage matches next June. But Judge Lorena Colnago has suspended all work on the arena after declaring that workers were at serious risk of being injured . An inspection will be held before work can resume after the judge stated that workers were in danger of ""being buried, run over, falling from heights and being hit by material, among other serious risks."" According to the Labor Court's press officer, Marcos Piso, the papers to suspend construction will be received by the venue's construction company CAP/SA Thursday. A meeting between the building firm and court inspectors has been scheduled for Friday to broker a deal and move the project forward. The stadium, which is owned by the Atletico Paranaense club, already had its original plans curtailed when the installation of a retractable roof was postponed until after the tournament. That decision followed a visit from FIFA Secretary General Jerome Valcke, who had declared that all stadiums would have to be ready by December. In August, Brazil's sports minister Aldo Rebelo relayed concerns over delays at five stadiums being built for next year's June 12-July 13 tournament. The opening game of the 2014 World Cup will be played in Sao Paulo, with the final set to take place at the world famous Maracana in Rio de Janeiro -- which reopened this year after lengthy renovations.","Brazilian judge halts work on World Cup stadium in Curitiba .

"The U.N. Security Council on Thursday unanimously approved the creation of a United Nations peacekeeping force for the Central African Republic, where competing militias have been fighting for months. The council approved the deployment of 11,800 peacekeepers to the country, where 6,500 African-led peacekeeping forces and about 2,000 French troops already have been operating. Additionally, the European Union is planning to deploy up to 1,000 troops. Starting on September 15, the force will initially comprise up to 10,000 military personnel, including 240 military observers and 200 staff officers, and 1,800 police personnel, according to the resolution. The Central African Republic, a former French colony, was plunged into chaos last year after a coalition of mostly Muslim rebels, known as Seleka, ousted President Francois Bozize. They have since been forced out of power, but Christian and Muslim militias continue to fight for control. To counter attacks on Christian communities by Seleka groups, vigilante Christian groups known as the anti-balaka, which translates to ""anti-machete,"" have fought back. Thousands have died during the fighting, and 2.2 million people, about half the country's population, are in need of humanitarian aid, according to the United Nations. More than 650,000 people are still internally displaced, and nearly 300,000 have fled to neighboring countries in search of refuge. Ban: Heed the lessons of the past . The spiraling ethnic violence in the Central African Republic has led some observers to fear another genocide like that seen in Rwanda exactly 20 years ago. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon drew that parallel Saturday when he visited the Central African Republic to focus the world's attention on the crisis. He urged the country's citizens to ""heed the lessons"" of nearby Rwanda and stop committing violence and atrocities against their fellow countrymen. ""Do not repeat the mistakes of the past -- heed the lessons. The fate of your country is in your hands. The people of CAR should not be killing the people of the CAR,"" he said, according to a U.N. news release. Ban warned that ""ethno-religious cleansing is a reality"" in the country and that anarchy now rules. ""Most members of the Muslim minority have fled. Muslims and Christians have been placed in mortal danger simply because of who they are or what they believe,"" he said. ""People have been lynched and decapitated. Sexual violence is on the rise. Gruesome acts have been committed while others cheered on the perpetrators. There has been total impunity -- zero accountability. This must change."" Rights group: Men and boys massacred . The U.N. vote comes a week after the group Human Rights Watch called for the international community to hasten the authorization and deployment of a U.N. peacekeeping force to protect vulnerable people in remote areas. In a report, it provided eyewitness accounts of the massacres of dozens of men and boys by militias in rural villages in the country's southwest, and said the African Union and French deployments were insufficient to safeguard the population. Ban praised the work done by the French and African Union forces so far but acknowledged that they were ""under-resourced and overwhelmed"" by the sheer scale of the crisis. Speaking Wednesday on a visit to the country, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power said, ""The world has not hesitated in the CAR as it did in Rwanda 20 years ago. However, it is obvious that the world has not done enough."" But, she said, the situation for civilians would be far worse if not for the presence of the existing peacekeeping forces. U.S. support to the AU-led mission includes the donation of vehicles and radio equipment. The U.N. resolution approved Thursday calls on the transitional authorities to step up preparations to hold ""free, fair, transparent and inclusive presidential and legislative elections"" no later than February 2015. Catherine Samba-Panza, the mayor of the national capital, Bangui, was recently installed as the country's interim President but faces a daunting challenge to restore stability to the country. Last year's coup was the latest in a series since the country gained independence in 1960.","Council approves deployment of 11,800 peacekeepers to Central African Republic .

"A senior Republican staffer is resigning after her comments that the Obama daughters should ""try showing a little class"" caused a firestorm of criticism on social media this weekend. Elizabeth Lauten, communications director for Tennessee Rep. Stephen Fincher, confirmed to CNN that she planned to resign Monday. She faced heavy backlash when she wrote a Thanksgiving-Day screed against the Obama daughters, as well as the President and first lady, on Facebook that quickly went viral across the web. In it, she scolded Malia and Sasha Obama, 16 and 13 years old, respectively, for what she said was their inappropriate outfits and their bored looks during Wednesday's turkey pardoning ceremony, which they attended alongside their father. ""Dear Sasha and Malia: I get you're both in those awful teen years, but you're a part of the First Family, try showing a little class. At least respect the part you play,"" Lauten wrote in the post. ""Then again, your mother and father don't respect their positions very much, or the nation for that matter,"" she added. ""So I'm guessing you're coming up a little short in the 'good role model' department."" Lauten went on to tell them to ""stretch yourself...rise to the occasion"" and ""act like being in the White House matters to you."" ""Dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar. And certainly don't make faces during televised, public events,"" she concluded. Hours later, after her comments picked up steam on social media, Lauten deleted it and wrote another post apologizing for her comments. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said during his briefing with reporters on Monday that while he was ""taken aback"" by her comments, he thought her apology was ""appropriate."" ""I was taken aback there was a political operative on Capitol Hill who did use the occastion of a Thanksgiving-themed event to criticize members of the First Family,"" Earnest said. ""I was a bit surprised by that. But I will say that she has posted an apology to her website, and I think that was an appropriate thing to do."" Neither Fincher nor his chief of staff, Jessica Carter, responded to requests for comment via email. But Lauten found few defenders this weekend, even drawing a rebuke from Republican National Committee Communications Director Sean Spicer via Twitter on Monday morning. ""Children, especially the first daughters, are off limits,"" he tweeted. Spicer was far more displeased, however, with the way the comments were covered by the media than he was with the comments themselves. ""While the comments were inappropriate and insensitive, the mainstream media's coverage of this story is appalling. In over 20 years in politics I have never seen 1 of the countless inappropriate comments by Democrats ever covered to a faction of this,"" Spicer added.","Elizabeth Lauten, communications director for Tennessee Rep.

"A driver of a commercial van ran over pedestrians at a train stop in eastern Jerusalem on Wednesday, killing an Israeli border police officer and injuring 13 other people before getting out of his vehicle and attacking people with a metal bar, Israeli police said. Police shot and killed the attacker, identified by Israeli authorities as a member of the Islamist Hamas movement and a resident of the Shuafat Palestinian refugee camp in eastern Jerusalem, Israeli police spokeswoman Luba Samri said. The attack came on another day of tension between Israelis and Palestinians over Jerusalem's Temple Mount -- one of the holiest sites in Judaism and Islam -- where Israeli police clashed with Palestinians on Wednesday. No motive for the van attack was immediately released, but Hamas backed it in a text message to the news media: ""Hamas blesses the action. What is happening in Jerusalem is pushing us to prepare for war."" Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld called the incident ""a terrorist attack."" Samri said the incident started when the van hit three border policemen waiting to cross the road. The van ran over pedestrians standing at the light-train station and continued to travel along the main road, hitting cars, until it struck a vehicle at a main intersection, she said. The driver got out and attacked people with an iron bar before police shot and killed him, she said. He was 38 years old and had recently been released from prison, Samri said. Israeli police, protesters clash at Temple Mount . Witness Khaled Husseini said he heard police fire about 20 shots. The van crashed in an area of Jerusalem with several large hotels. Video from the scene showed emergency response workers in orange vests lifting victims into waiting ambulances. At least one body was lying in the road covered with a sheet, but it was not clear whether that was the van's driver. Husseini said he saw Israeli police officers lying on the road after being hit by the van. The attack comes on the heels of two hit-and-run incidents that happened in Jerusalem and the West Bank last month. On October 22, a Palestinian man rammed his car into commuters waiting at a light rail stop in Jerusalem, killing a baby and wounding several other people, Israeli police said. Palestinian state news reported that a 5-year-old girl died October 19 after an Israeli settler deliberately ran over her as she returned home from kindergarten near a village to the north of Ramallah in the West Bank, according to medical sources. A second 5-year-old girl was struck and was listed in critical condition, Palestinian state news said. The driver fled the scene.","Police identify the driver as member of Hamas .

"For those of us who live inland, hurricane-tracking seems more a curious indulgence, but if you live along the coastal regions in a hurricane zone, keeping tabs on these atmospheric leviathans is paramount. Here's a rundown of 2012′s top hurricane tracking apps for those on the go with tablets or smartphones. Hurricane Tracker (iOS) My pick of the bunch, EZ Apps' $2.99 Hurricane Tracker offers detailed storm maps, National Hurricane Center info, threat level maps, audio/video forecast updates, real-time feeds and push alerts. It also employs my favorite interface, giving you four simple categories at launch — hurricanes, tropical storms, tropical depressions and invests — to drill on, with a ""quick headlines"" blurb and ""current systems"" maps when you scroll down the page. The number of maps (including animated) and images crammed into this app — EZ Apps claims over 65 — is worth the price of admission alone. Hurricane Hound (Android) Hurricane Hound uses Google Maps as its framework and tracks both forecasts and the locations of Atlantic and East Pacific hurricanes and tropical storms, points out areas the National Weather Service is keeping tabs on and offers standard NWS ""tropical outlooks and discussions, public advisories, forecasts, and satellite imagery."" Fair warning: The free version of Hurricane Hound hasn't been updated in over a year, and it looks like the $1.99 add-free version is where developer STKI Concepts is focusing its attention, recently adding support for ""current radar and weather satellite overlays."" Hurricane / Hurricane HD (iOS) Developer Kitty Code's longstanding $2.99 hurricane-watching app (updated in June) offers a repository of global meteorological information, including tracking maps, satellite views, five-day forecasts, radar and bulletins from the National Hurricane Center. Pull up Hurricane Isaac and you can see information about wind speed, storm speed and direction as well as follow it from its genesis off the west coast of Africa in mid-August through its current position several hundred miles southeast of the Mississippi River Delta. Probably the app's most valuable function: using iOS's locational services to determine how far away you are. If all you need is tracking for the Atlantic, Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico and the Eastern and Central Pacific, Kitty Code offers Hurricane Express, a cheaper $0.99 version that eschews the app's global features, and if you're looking for the tablet-optimized version of Hurricane, Kitty Code offers Hurricane HD for $3.99, which adds ""exclusive"" video and blog updates from HurricaneTrack.com. Hurricane Software (Android) When I checked in last, Hurricane Software was a promising beta freebie. It's now out of beta — still free, though ad-littered (there's a $2.99 ad-free ""Pro"" version) — and packing hurricane data from the National Hurricane Center, high resolution maps, satellite images, warning information and storm tracks. iHurricane HD (iOS) iHurricane HD is free with ads, distinguishing itself from the pack by tucking a few features behind an in-app paywall. Out of the gate, you can track hurricanes using satellite and radar data, stage email alerts and gauge your distance from ""each coordinate of the storm."" But if you want the app's push services, ""more space on the main map"" and to banish those annoying ads that sit at the top of the screen, you'll have to fork over $2.99 through an in-app purchase option. Hurricane -- American Red Cross (Android, iOS) Last but not least, Hurricane -- American Red Cross for both Android or iOS is a newer, totally free addition to Android's growing hurricane-tracking stable, but it's more than just a tracker — this app lets you ""monitor conditions in your area or throughout the storm track, prepare your family and home, find help and let others know you are safe even if the power is out."" It's a little light on meteorological data, but think of it as the ""safety first"" tracker, and check out the video below for a few examples of it in action.","Isaac appears to weaken, but hurricane tracking still important .

"(CNN)The director of a video showing a woman being catcalled on the streets of New York has weighed in on the seeming racial disparity of the men featured. Rob Bliss, who posted the video on behalf of the anti-street-harassment group Hollaback!, told CNN that those shown were just a small sample. ""Looking at this as being some type of sample that is completely balanced, I think, is never going to be accurate,"" he said. ""To do that, we would have had to shoot for days and days, and we didn't set out to make a long video."" Bliss, who was inspired by the experiences of his girlfriend, tracked volunteer Shoshana Roberts as she walked through the city over the course of 10 hours. The video shows her being greeted by mostly black and Latino men with calls like ""Hey, baby,"" ""Damn!"" and ""What's up, beautiful?"" Some of the men even follow her. In a Slate article headlined ""The Problem With That Catcalling Video,"" writer Hanna Rosin notes that ""The one dude who turns around and says, 'Nice,' is white, but the guys who do the most egregious things -- like the one who harangues her, 'Somebody's acknowledging you for being beautiful! You should say thank you more,' or the one who follows her down the street too closely for five whole minutes -- are not."" Bliss said that during the 10 hours captured on video, there were 108 instances of street harassment, of which he had 30 to 40 scenes with good enough quality for him to consider. He whittled that down to 20 scenes in the one minute and 57 second video. It's difficult to distinguish that about six of the men were white because the faces were blurred, Bliss said. ""We have 18 scenes where someone is visible and on camera, and two of the scenes ate up half of the run time"" of the video, he said. ""And yes, those two men were not white. ""We knew this wasn't going to be an accurate representation,"" Bliss added. ""For example, there are no Asian men, but that doesn't mean that Asian men don't do this, too."" Critics questioned the disparity on social media. One tweeted, ""To demonize men of color as the only perpetrators of aggression towards women is patently false and irresponsible. #Catcalling."" Another person tweeted, ""I just got an attitude from an older white male ,I didn't say good morning. #Catcalling since everyone wants to make this a race issue."" Rosin points out that Bliss, who heads the marketing company Rob Bliss Creative and told New Republic ""I make viral videos for a living,"" has been accused of not being inclusive before. In 2011, a blogger wrote about the Grand Rapids Lip Dub video project, which Bliss hosted. Directed on the streets of the Michigan city, it featured participants lip-syncing the words to Don McLean's ""American Pie"" and according to the Grand Rapids Press was one of several community events Bliss organized. But a blogger identified as ""kswheeler"" wrote that the result didn't exactly reflect the racial makeup of Grand Rapids at the time: 57% white, 18.9% black, 13% Latino and 1.62% Asian-American. ""Otherwise, Grand Rapids looks like Oz,"" the blogger wrote. ""And the people look like they've been reincarnated from those peppy family-style 1970s musical acts from Disney World or Knott's Berry Farm."" Bliss, 26, said the Grand Rapids video had an open call for participation. As for his latest project, he said the focus on the race of the men has been a distraction and ""very frustrating."" In no way was he trying to portray one race as being more apt to harass women in the streets, he said. ""I simply wanted to capture street harassment in a very intimate, close-up way in the real world and have people talk about it,"" Bliss said. ""I just wanted to lay it all bare."" Thursday morning on CNN's ""New Day,"" Roberts discussed her experience with the catcalls, noting that because she was carrying two microphones while Bliss walked ahead of her with a backpack camera, ""We had great audio."" As for the racial makeup of the men who attempt to interact with her, she said they were ""men of all colors -- in my experience every day, men of all colors. It doesn't matter what size, shape, color."" CNN's Jamie Gumbrecht contributed to this story.","Director Rob Bliss says the men in the video were just a small sample .

"Former President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani's abrupt fall from grace has taken many in political circles in Iran by surprise, further widening the gap between an increasingly insular and narrow hard-line elite and the rest of the country. It reinforces a trend towards the consolidation of power around Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and his acolytes, which has been taking place for the better part of a decade, and perhaps the real surprise is the fact is that there remain members of the elite who did not think this remorseless process would ultimately apply to them. Ever since the political catastrophe of 2009, when millions pored onto the streets to protest what was widely considered to be a highly fraudulent election process, the regime has been keen to encourage the public to put the past behind them and to look forward to these elections as a cathartic exercise during which political blemishes could be washed away. Rafsanjani's dramatic last-minute entrance into the race, was seen by many as proof that some lessons had indeed been learnt. But if Rafsanjani was to galvanize the public, then his platform had to be radical and his boast that he had come to ""save the nation"" and effectively ""reboot"" the Islamic Republic, was certainly bold. However, the fact that he claimed that he had to ask permission to run, was indicative of how far the political realities of Iran had changed since he had last been president (1989-1997). No sooner had he registered than the bitter personal attacks came from the hard-liners; while others questioned just what the nature of the agreement with Khamenei had been, if any. Amanpour explains: Iran's presidential election . But perhaps most galling was that for all the hype and excitement generated by his supporters, the public appeared unmoved. Popular momentum might have developed, though the task would have been considerably harder than 2009 given the absence of a political infrastructure of street activists, (largely dismantled since 2009), and above all the sheer cynicism of the voting public. Public apathy combined with the conceit of the new ruling class, to deliver a particularly brutal humiliation to Rafsanjani, barred apparently not for his political views, but for the rather less dignified reason that the members of the Guardian Council thought Rafsanjani too old to be able to bear the burden of office. Rafsanjani's dramatic entrance and precipitous fall has shone a light on the growing fractures within elite politics in Iran. To date Khamenei has been able to blame divisions on Ahmadinejad and his ""deviant current"" on the one hand, and the foreign inspired sedition of Mir-Hussein Musavi and Mehdi Karrubi (still under house arrest) on the other. Few expected Ahmadinejad's protégé, Esfandyar Rahim Mashaie, to survive the vetting process -- other that is, than Ahmadinejad, for whom being on the ""outside"" must be an uncomfortable experience. Similarly, if slightly more realistically, few of Rafsanjani's supporters considered him vulnerable. He remained after all a pillar of the establishment, even if two of his children had been hounded into jail and he had effectively been ostracized over the past four years for his tentative support of the Green Movement. Read more: How the U.S. should respond to Iran's election . It says much of the ""wishful thinking"" that remains prevalent, that they thought this a political virtue. Firm in the belief that the Islamic Republic faced an existential threat, they had retained their faith in the integrity of a system that has long since transformed beyond recognition into a sacred autocracy. Indeed the unpredictability of the Iranian political system is not a reflection of its inherent 'democracy', but of the absence of the rule of law and the growing identification of power in the person of Khamenei. Both the Guardian Council's ""rulings"" (which it should be stressed are neither published nor explained) and the fact they can be overturned on the whims of the Supreme Leader, are indicative of this harsh reality. What we are left with is a tightly controlled ""election"" with a dry and uninteresting field. Of the eight ratified candidates, one is a nonentity, (Mohammad Gharazi); two are ostensible ""moderates"" lacking in charisma and therefore non-threatening, (Hassan Rouhani and Mohammad Reza Aref); one is an independent Principle-ist (Mohsen Rezaei) who likes to speak his mind but on past performance is unlikely to garner votes (real or imagined); while the remaining four are self proclaimed acolytes of the Leader. Of these four, two have been highlighted as the probable annointees: Saeed Jalili, the current head of the National Security Council, and Mohammad Ghalibaf, the mayor of Tehran. Jalili is widely assumed to be the favorite and his web presence is suitably polished and indicative of considerable preparation, though quite who the audience for this is, given the current restrictions on internet access in the run-up to the election, remains unclear. Jalili is perhaps closest ideologically to the Supreme Leader. For this particular puritan, the crisis Iran faces is not existential, it is an opportunity to be seized and a trial to be welcomed. Ghalibaf, who once fancied himself as Iran's answer to Tom Cruise, has had his popular credibility bruised by the sudden release of a recording of a speech he allegedly gave to members of the Basij militia bragging about how much he enjoyed getting on his motorbike and thumping students. Ghalibaf has vigorously dismissed the recording as a malicious smear, but it says much about current politics that there are many who find it credible. The real question of course is the source of the leak; and herein perhaps lies the real significance of recent developments. In 2009, the regime lost the people; it now appears to be in the process of divesting itself of its traditional elite. How the newly disenfranchised react will be interesting to watch. This may be the real legacy of the ""election"" of 2013.","Iranian regime is keen to encourage the public to put the past behind them, Ali Ansari writes .

"Being a father has had an unexpected result for best-selling author Khaled Hosseini -- it's boosted his fan base. Hosseini explains with a laugh that his 12-year-old son posted a gushing review of his latest book, ""And the Mountains Echoed,"" on Goodreads. His son is at an age when many children experience what Hosseini calls an awakening into adulthood: They start to realize their parents are flawed. While there is no inkling of that sentiment in his son's review, Hosseini remembers that moment in his own life. Coming of age is a common theme in his books. ""And the Mountains Echoed"" tells the story of two loving siblings ripped apart by their family's hardship. That rupture affects generations in a story that stretches across continents, and through decades. Afghanistan provides the inspiration and backdrop for ""And the Mountains Echoed"" as well as Hosseini's previous novels, ""The Kite Runner"" and ""A Thousand Splendid Suns."" His books have sold more than 38 million copies around the world. The author credits his children with making him a powerful writer. Hosseini says when he became a parent, he could empathize with the agonizing decisions his characters face in his novels. ""There is no question that it has transformed and informed my way of writing,"" he says. Hosseini yearns to take his son, Haris, and his daughter, Farah, 10, to Afghanistan. ""That would be my dream,"" he says. Hosseini lived in Kabul until he was 11. Since then, the 48-year-old author has traveled to his native country as a goodwill envoy for the U.N. Refugee Agency. He has not yet taken his children to Afghanistan because he says he worries about their safety. But he plans to bring them to Kabul one day: ""I would love to go back with them and show them around the city, show them where I was raised, where I went to school, so they can see for themselves this place that I keep writing about,"" he says. In addition to writing, Hosseini dedicates his time to providing shelter for returning refugee families through the Khaled Hosseini Foundation, which funds learning centers for women and helps to protect children involved in the rug-making industry. ""I see the mission of my foundation to reach out and help people who are exactly like the characters in my books,"" he says. His travels to Afghanistan not only inform his philanthropic efforts -- they also shape his writing. But he says he doesn't intend to travel there to find material for his books. ""Nevertheless, it seeps into my consciousness,"" he says. ""And when I sit down to write stories what I've seen in Afghanistan does inform me."" He remembers meeting a pair of sisters in the fall of 2009. They lived in an isolated village, about an hour outside Kabul.  The older sister, who was about 6 years old, treated her little sister like a daughter. ""They were strikingly beautiful and extremely sweet-natured,"" he says.  ""And they were clinging to each other."" As he left, he gave the older sister an apple. She quickly turned around and gave it to her little sister. ""It touched me deeply, and I was very moved by seeing that,"" he says. That bond between those two sisters became the inspiration for the young siblings at the heart of ""And the Mountains Echoed."" Children are often the protagonists in Hosseini's books. He says he is fascinated with the time when a young person has one foot in childhood and another in adulthood: ""That age of 12 or so, when the foundations of the world as the child has thus far known it are beginning to crack, and the world is revealing itself to be more nuanced, more complicated, more messy, more troubling (than they imagined)."" Many of his characters go through this metamorphosis. He draws on his childhood to make that journey compelling. ""All of us grow up with these kind of archetypal notions of our parents and of the people we admire,"" he says. ""And as we grow older, we recognize them to be more fallible than we thought."" He recalls his relationship with his father changing when he was a young man. ""Of course, I grew up thinking my Dad was the strongest man in the world. He was the smartest man in the world,"" he says of his father, who died in December 2009. ""He was very, very, very dear to me,"" Hosseini says. ""But I do remember getting older and beginning to disagree with my Dad, on important issues: politics and other things."" Hosseini and his family came to the United States as asylum seekers. He considers himself lucky. On World Refugee Day last week, he helped to spread awareness about the more than 40 million people who are displaced. ""Refugees are people, just like us, just like anybody else. They're not just statistics,"" he says. ""We can all contribute to those essential programs that bring resources and services to some of the world's most vulnerable people."" Hosseini's work reinforces his message. For many readers, ""And the Mountains Echoed"" will lend faces and emotions to refugees who live in danger of being overlooked.","""And the Mountains Echoed"" is Khaled Hosseini's first new book in six years .

"The friend who was on the phone with Trayvon Martin when his fatal confrontation with George Zimmerman began said Monday she is ""disappointed, upset, angry, questioning and mad"" at Zimmerman's acquittal on murder charges. Rachel Jeantel called the verdict ""BS"" and said Martin, 17, was never aggressive. ""He was a calm, chill, loving person who loved his family, definitely his mother, and a good friend,"" Jeantel told CNN's ""Piers Morgan Live."" Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Florida, was acquitted Saturday of second-degree murder charges in Martin's death. The killing sparked protests when police declined to bring charges against Zimmerman, leading to the appointment of a special prosecutor who eventually took the case to court. Prosecutors had argued that Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, had profiled and pursued the African-American teen. Juror: 'No doubt' that Zimmerman feared for his life . As the last person to speak to Martin, Jeantel was one of the prosecution's key witnesses. On the witness stand, she described how Martin told her over the phone that some ""creepy-ass cracker"" was following him and how he turned toward Zimmerman and asked, ""Why are you following me for?"" Zimmerman had called police to report Martin as a suspicious person in his neighborhood. The unarmed Martin was wearing a hooded sweatshirt and was staying with his father at the nearby home of his father's girlfriend. Juror: Jeantel wasn't a good witness . Jeantel dismissed arguments that the case had no racial dimension. ""It was racial. Let's be honest, racial. If Trayvon was white and he had a hoodie on, would that happen?"" she asked. Zimmerman told detectives Martin began pummeling him when he approached him, against the advice of a police dispatcher, and that he had to shoot to save his own life. He didn't testify during the trial, however -- and Jeantel said his defense was ""acting like a punk"" by attempting to paint Martin as a mortal threat. Despite outrage, federal charges uncertain in Zimmerman case . ""If you were a real man you would have stand on that stage and tell what happened,"" she said, calling Zimmerman ""weak"" and ""scary."" Zimmerman's lawyers successfully argued for the right to present evidence that Martin had marijuana traces in his system, but never brought that before a jury or presented any testimony about whether the drug could have affected Martin's behavior. Jeantel acknowledged that Martin smoked marijuana, but added, ""Weed don't make him go crazy, it just makes him go hungry."" Now that he's free, can Zimmerman make a living? The 19-year-old found herself in the unforgiving spotlight of a nationally televised trial, in which viewers criticized her for her dress, her weight and her speech and her combative manner on the stand. She admitted to lying about her age and her reasons for skipping Martin's funeral. She later explained she is of Haitian descent and grew up speaking Spanish and Creole, and she said Monday that her speech was also affected by an underbite that will require surgery to correct. Jeantel on attorney Don West: 'I'll hold it back' A juror who spoke to CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" on Monday said she had difficulty understanding Jeantel and didn't consider her a credible witness, ""but I felt very sorry for her."" ""She didn't ask to be in this place ... She wanted to go. She wanted to leave.  She didn't want to be any part of this jury. I think she felt inadequate toward everyone because of her education and her communications skills. I just felt sadness for her.""

"For more than two weeks, satellites, planes and ships have been deployed to scour huge swathes of ocean for clues relating to the mysterious disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 and the 239 people on board. So far, an area covering 2.97 million square miles -- almost the size of the United States -- has yielded some leads but no proof of where the Boeing 777-200 is or what happened to it. In the past week, the spotlight has shifted to an expanse of the Indian Ocean more than 1,500 miles (2,400 kilometers) southwest of Australia, triggered by satellite images showing ""suspicious"" objects floating in the water. Chinese plane spots 'suspicious objects' We look at some of the hardware involved in this difficult search of one of the most inhospitable corners of the planet. Satellites . China has had satellite assets deployed in the search for the missing airliner from the early stages of its disappearance -- including the optical earth observation satellite ""Gaofen-1,"" which is responsible for the latest images of ""suspect objects"" floating in the southern Indian Ocean. The current southern corridor search was triggered by images from another commercial satellite obtained and analyzed by Australian authorities, but identification by aircraft dispatched to identify the objects turned up nothing. World listens for fading pings . NASA has said it will also deploy space-based assets over the Indian Ocean such as the Earth-Observing-1 (EO-1) satellite and the remote-controlled ISERV camera on the International Space Station to acquire images of possible crash sites. The resolution of these images could be used to identify objects of about 98 feet (30 meters) or larger. The space-sourced information includes more than images: In the past few days France said data from satellite-generated radar echoes ""identified some debris that could be from the Malaysia Airlines plane."" Radar echoes are electronic signals that are sent out and bounce back if contact is made with an object on the surface. Aircraft . Reconnaissance aircraft from Australia, New Zealand, the United States and China are currently involved in the search for, and identification of, this ocean-based debris. P-3 Orion . Initially deployed as a Cold War-era submarine hunter in the 1960s, Lockheed's P-3 Orion is a mainstay of many modern air forces. A number of upgraded variants are being used in the search for MH370, including the P-3C (U.S. Navy) AP-3C Orion (Royal Australian Air force), P-3K2 Orion (New Zealand Air Force) and P-3J Orion (Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force) The P-3's long-range, long-loiter capability -- it can remain in the air for up to 16 hours -- has made it the benchmark for maritime patrol aircraft -- and perfect for this type of search. Sophisticated sensors on board the aircraft can detect sound 1,000 feet (304 meters) below the water's surface, while it can fly just 200 feet (60 meters) above the water. P-8A Poseidon . A new addition to the U.S. Navy's arsenal, the P-8A from Boeing is arguably the world's most sophisticated anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare aircraft. It is being phased in as the replacement for the P-3 Orion in the U.S. Navy. Built on the reliable Boeing 737 airframe, the Poseidon has a maximum speed of 490 knots, can fly up to 41,000 feet (12,496 meters) and can cover more than 1,200 nautical miles in four hours, according to the U.S. Navy. For the MH370 search, the P-8 will typically fly at 5,000 feet (1,524 meters), dipping to 1,000 feet to get a closer visual look at objects, the U.S. Navy said. They will typically fly at a speed of 250-270 knots, with a search time of eight to nine hours depending on the distance to the search area. According to the U.S. Navy, the P-8's advanced radar capabilities allow its crew to recognize and investigate small contacts on the water's surface. The crew can also use an onboard camera system, as well as a multitude of sensors, to investigate contacts. Ilyushin Il-76 . The Chinese Air Force has deployed two Russian-made Il-76 aircraft to join the search. The four-engine, medium-range giant can be used as a commercial freighter or military transporter, able to carry heavy payloads such as vehicles and other outsized cargo via its ramp. It has a maximum speed of 458 knots and a ceiling of 39,370 feet (12,000 meters). The II-76 also has an Aerial-Delivery System (ADS) for dropping cargo and other equipment while in flight -- something that may be useful if a crash site is found. Get up to speed . Surface ships and equipment . A Chinese icebreaker -- which was involved in the rescue of a Russian research vessel stuck in the Antarctic ice earlier this year -- has now changed course and is steaming towards the location where the latest debris has been spotted in the southern Indian Ocean. The helicopter-carrying Xuelong -- or Snow Dragon -- is expected to arrive in the search area on Tuesday, and has a ""good knowledge"" of the area, Qin Weijia, deputy director of the State Oceanic Administration's polar expedition office, told China's state-run Xinhua news agency. Britain's Royal Navy has also dispatched a coastal survey ship, HMS Echo, to join the search. Launched in 2002, Echo was designed to carry out a wide range of survey work, including support to submarine and amphibious operations, through the collection of oceanographic and bathymetric  --analysis of the ocean, its salinity and sound profile -- data, according to the Royal Navy. The U.S. Navy's 7th Fleet has been a major contributor to the search from the get-go, providing ships, aircraft and considerable technical know-how. In addition to air operations, the fleet has deployed surface ships equipped with sophisticated search capabilities. As a precautionary measure in case a debris field is located, the fleet is moving a ""black box"" locator into the region -- which would provide a significant advantage in locating the missing aircraft's own flight data recorder, according to Commander William J. Marks, spokesperson for the 7th Fleet. According to Marks, the ""TPL-25 Towed Pinger Locator System"" is able to locate black boxes on downed Navy and commercial aircraft down to a maximum depth of 20,000 feet (6,096 meters) anywhere in the world. The Pinger Locator is towed behind a vessel at slow speeds, generally from 1-5 knots depending on the depth. The tow ""fish"" carries a passive listening device for detecting pingers that automatically transmit an acoustic pulse.","The more than two-week search for MH370 has covered an area the size of the U.S.

"(CNN) -- The pilot of the Asiana Airlines plane that crashed in San Francisco on Saturday was making his first landing with a Boeing 777 at San Francisco International Airport, the airline said. But it wasn't his first time flying to San Francisco. The pilot, Lee Kang-gook, had flown from Seoul to the city several times between 1999 and 2004, the airline said. He has also clocked 43 hours flying a Boeing 777. [Previous story, updated at 10:14 p.m. ET] . NTSB: Pilots attempted to abort landing 1.5 seconds before impact . (CNN) -- The cockpit voice recorder of Asiana Airlines Flight 214 appears to show the pilots tried to abort the landing less than two seconds before the plane crashed on the runway at San Francisco International Airport, the head of the National Transportation Safety Board said Sunday. The plane's voice and flight data recorders show that the flight from South Korea was coming in too slow and too low and that the pilots appear to have increased speed seven seconds before impact, Deborah Hersman said. A stall warning sounded four seconds before the crash, and the crew then made an internal decision ""to initiate a go-around 1.5 seconds to impact,"" she said. The NTSB's preliminary assessment of the plane's cockpit and flight data recorders appear to indicate that the flight went from a routine landing to a disaster in a matter of seconds. But when asked if pilot error was to blame, Hersman said the crash landing was still under investigation. ""I would discourage anyone from drawing any conclusions at this point,"" she said, adding that investigators are still working to corroborate the information on the recorders. But what happened inside the cockpit of the Boeing 777 may well be the key factor in Saturday's accident that killed two people, injured 182 and forced the temporary closure of one of the country's largest airports. Amateur video obtained exclusively by CNN on Sunday shows the plane approaching the runway and striking what appears to be a seawall before spinning counterclockwise and coming to a stop. Fred Hayes said he shot the video about a mile from the crash scene. Related: Asiana Airlines crash: At a glance . Some of the answers to what happened may just hinge on what investigators found on the voice and flight data recorders. ""What we need to do is corroborate the information we have both on the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder,"" Hersman said. ""...But I'll tell you some of the things we are seeing on the flight data recorder are mirroring some of the things that are going on on the cockpit voice recorder."" For example, she said, the increase of power in the engines appears to correlate with the cockpit crew's internal decision to do a ""go-around,"" a call to abort the landing and try it again. Asiana Flight 214, with 291 passengers and 16 crew members, was at the end of a more than 10-hour direct flight from Seoul, South Korea, when it began its descent. According to the recorders, the flight's approach appeared normal as the 777 descended, and ""there is no discussion of aircraft approach"" among the crew. The target air speed for the approach of the flight was 137 knots, and the crew can be heard on the cockpit voice recorder acknowledging the speed, Hersman said. But the speed was significantly below 137 knots, and ""we are not talking about a few knots,"" she said. At about four seconds before the plane crash landed, the pilots received an ""aural and physical"" warning inside the cockpit that the plane was on the verge of an aerodynamic stall, meaning it was about to lose its ability to stay in the air. The warning -- known as a ""stick shaker"" -- included a verbal warning the plane that was flying too low and a physical warning when the throttle shook. South Korean and NTSB investigators will jointly question Lee Kang-gook, the pilot who was sitting in the captain's seat of Asiana Flight 214, on Monday, Choi Jeong-ho, the head of South Korean's Aviation Policy Bureau, said. Lee had 43 hours of experience flying the B777-200, he said. They will also question Lee Jeong-min, who was sitting in the co-pilot's seat, Choi said. Asiana CEO and President Yoon Young-doo has said there was no engine failure, to his knowledge. South Korean investigators will work alongside U.S. investigators. The NTSB has ruled out weather as a problem and said that conditions were right for a ""visual landing."" But investigators are looking into whether construction at the airport may have played a role. Construction to extend a runway safety area temporarily shut off the so-called glide slope system, which is one of several options pilots have to help them land planes safely, Hersman said. Internal damage to the plane is ""really striking,"" she said, and officials are thankful there weren't more deaths. Survivors of the crash were being treated Sunday for injuries ranging from paralysis to ""severe road rash."" In all, 182 people were hospitalized and 123 others walked away from the crash landing. The number who emerged unscathed prompted the city's fire chief to describe it as ""nothing short of a miracle."" On the runway, medics found the bodies of the two teen girls lying next to burning wreckage. They were identified by Asiana Airlines as Ye Mengyuan and Wang Linjia, both Chinese nationals. ""We were expecting a lot of burns,"" said  Dr. Margaret Knudson, San Francisco General Hospital's chief of surgery. ""But we didn't see them."" At San Francisco General, 17 survivors remained hospitalized, six of them in critical condition. Related: Passengers knew they were too low . Many of the injured said they were sitting toward the rear of the aircraft, said Knudson. Several suffered abdominal injuries and spine fractures, some of which include paralysis and head trauma, she said. Many patients also were treated for ""severe road rash,"" which suggests ""that they were dragged,"" Knudson said. The conditions of victims at other hospitals were not made public Sunday. Survivors and witnesses reported the 7-year-old airliner appeared to be flying too low as it approached the end of a runway near the bay. Expert: The plane 'should never have been close to the seawall' Airport technology called the Instrument Landing System, or ILS -- which normally would help pilots correctly approach the runway -- was not operating at the time, according to a Federal Aviation Administration bulletin. The ILS integrates with the aircraft's cockpit to trigger an audible warning, consultant and retired 777 pilot Mark Weiss told CNN. ""You hear a mechanical voice that says, 'too low, too low, too low.'"" The ILS is ""nice to have,"" Weiss said, ""but it's not critical on the 777.""  There are redundant systems aboard the aircraft that would provide similar warnings if the plane was coming in too low, said Weiss, who has landed 777s hundreds of times. The pilot operating the aircraft was a veteran who had been flying for Asiana since 1996, the airline said. Witnesses recount the crash . Survivors reported hearing no warning from the cockpit before the landing. Passengers scrambled to exit a crash scene that one survivor described as ""surreal."" When rescuers arrived, they found some passengers coming out of the water, said city fire chief Joanne Hayes-White. ""There was a fire on the plane, so the assumption might be that they went near the water's edge, which is very shallow, to maybe douse themselves with water,"" she said. Related: Why the crash was survivable . Some jumped out or slid down emergency chutes with luggage in hand. Statistically, 2012 was the safest year in terms of aviation accidents worldwide since 1945, according to the Aviation Safety Network. Data show that there were 23 fatal airliner accidents, which caused 511 deaths, according to ASN stats. That's well below the 10-year annual average of 34 accidents and 773 fatalities. Survival rates have improved due to better staff training and safety advances during the 1980s and 1990s, according to the group.

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- Thousands of Greek public sector workers began a 48-hour strike Tuesday against planned cuts in government spending. An estimated 2,000 protesters representing teachers from the public sector marched past the finance ministry and parliament, according to local police. In central Athens protesters threw plastic bottles and sticks at riot police, says CNN producer Erin Mclaughlin, who said that about 200 retired Greek workers also took to the streets Tuesday. In another demonstration members of the Communist Party of Greece (KKE) erected large banners near the Parthenon -- one read ""People of Europe Rise Up."" Workers are demonstrating against tough planned austerity measures to meet European Union and International Monetary Fund conditions on a €110 billion ($146 billion) aid package .

"(CNN) -- A ""faulty"" flight instrument contributed to the crash of a Turkish plane last month in the Netherlands, an accident that killed nine people and injured more than 60 others, Dutch safety authorities said on Wednesday. Turkish Airlines workers carry the coffins of four staff who died in the crash. On February 25, Turkish Airlines Flight 1951 from Istanbul to Amsterdam dropped from the sky on approach to the landing strip at Schiphol Airport, shattering into three pieces in a muddy field. Pieter van Vollenhoven, head of the Dutch Safety Board, said the instrument was one of the plane's two altimeters, which measure altitude. Because of the ""faulty"" left altimeter, the plane on automatic pilot reacted as if it were lower than it was and started to behave as if it was touching down. The plane was at 700 meters but the instrument indicated that it was at ground level. This caused the automatic throttles to slow the plane down, leading to a loss of speed. The plane was on automatic pilot when it crashed. Van Vollenhoven said there had been misty weather and if it were clearer then the pilots might have noticed how far up they were. He said that if such instruments don't function, automatic pilots should not be used for landings. Investigators said there had been faulty meter readings on two other flights but the pilots were able to land. Van Vollenhoven said that the pilots realized the problem but failed to appreciate what had been happening until it was too late. In the immediate aftermath of the crash investigators said the plane fell almost vertically to the ground indicating the aircraft did not have enough forward speed. The plane crash less than 500 yards short of the runway. Passengers described feeling the plane suddenly drop before impact, and at least one passenger said he heard the pilot trying to give more power to the engines before it went down. Four of the crew and three Boeing employees were among the nine people killed in the crash. Turkey's flagship airline is well-rated internationally for its overall safety record and the Boeing 737-800 has a good safety record. The last previous fatal incident at the Amsterdam airport happened in April 1994 when a KLM aircraft crashed as it tried to return to Schiphol shortly after takeoff.","Turkish plane that crashed in Netherlands had faulty instrument .

"President Barack Obama will nominate Bob McDonald -- a West Point graduate and former CEO of Procter & Gamble -- to head the Department of Veterans Affairs, a White House official told CNN on Sunday. McDonald would take over a troubled department. The VA, a massive bureaucracy with more than 300,000 full-time employees, is under fire as it deals with allegations of alarming shortcomings at its medical facilities. The controversy, as CNN first reported, involves delayed care with potentially fatal consequences in possibly dozens of cases. Eric Shinseki stepped down as head of the department in May after Republicans, Democrats and veterans' advocacy groups joined together in calling for his resignation. Obama went before reporters to make the announcement after meeting with Shinseki, saying the retired Army general told him ""the VA needs new leadership"" to address widespread issues. McDonald's mix of business experience and personal ties to the military and veteran community -- his father also served in World War II -- is unusual for the position but may be just what the White House is looking for. A statement from the White House touted McDonald's 33 years at P&G and described his as the ""perfect person to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs during this important time."" ""At P&G, he oversaw more than 120,000 employees, with operations around the world, selling products in more than 180 countries, in more than 2.5 million stores, reaching more than 5 billion customers,"" the statement reads. McDonald was also recognized for his leadership, twice named as the best company for leaders by Chief Executive Magazine and being named No. 1 in Hay Group's Best Companies for Leadership Study, which annually analyzes over 2,200 companies around the world. In the Army, McDonald served as a captain, primarily in the 82nd Airborne Division and received the meritorious service medal. He received a bachelor's degree in engineering from West Point and an MBA from the University of Utah. McDonald will leave his home in Cincinnati, where P&G is based, to start the complex process of untangling the VA's many problems. ""This is definitely a surprising pick. McDonald is not a name that was on anyone's radar over the last few weeks,"" Paul Rieckhoff,  Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America CEO and founder, said in a statement. ""His branding background may prove helpful, because there are few organizations in America with a worse reputation with its customers than the VA right now. ""He's been away from the military for quite a while and will have to move quickly to show he is committed to and understands the post-9/11 generation of veterans. We look forward to hearing from him soon and working together to support our vets,"" said Rieckhoff. It remains to be seen what kind of reception McDonald will receive on Capitol Hill, but members of Congress are adamant that change is needed. ""Bob McDonald is a good man, a veteran, and a strong leader with decades of experience in the private sector.  With those traits, he's the kind of person who is capable of implementing the kind of dramatic systemic change that is badly needed and long overdue at the VA,"" said House Speaker John Boehner. Rep. Jeff Miller of Florida, chairman of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, said in a statement to CNN that if McDonald is confirmed by the Senate, he would inherit a department ""under a specter of corruption that may very well surpass anything in the history of American government."" ""He'll need to root out the culture of dishonesty and fraud that has taken hold within the department and is contributing to all of its most pressing challenges. Quite simply, those who created the VA scandal will need to be purged from the system,"" Miller said. Sen. Bernie Sanders, the independent from Vermont and chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, echoed those sentiments. ""The VA needs significantly improved transparency and accountability, and it needs an increased number of doctors, nurses and other medical staff so that all eligible veterans get high-quality health care in a timely manner,"" Sanders said in a statement to CNN. ""I look forward to meeting with Mr. McDonald next week in order to ascertain his views on these important issues."" Since Shinseki's resignation, the White House has deepened its investigation into what went wrong at the agency. On Friday, a White House report said the agency's health care system is in need of complete overhaul because of unresponsive leadership and a ""corrosive culture"" that affects the delivery of medical care. The report was prepared by Rob Nabors, who is Obama's deputy chief of staff and who the President dispatched to assess the situation at the troubled agency. ""It is clear that there are significant and chronic systemic failures that must be addressed by the leadership at VA,"" the reports reads. ""The department must take swift and appropriate accountability actions,"" the report said. ""There must be a recognition of how true accountability works."" 'Corrosive culture,' weak leadership cripple VA, report says .","Bob McDonald is a ""surprising pick,"" says the head of an advocacy group .

"House Speaker John Boehner said Friday he has sued the Obama Administration in federal court over its decisions to make changes to the President's health care law, which congressional Republicans argue were unconstitutional. The move was expected for months -- the GOP-controlled House of Representatives voted to approve the lawsuit in July. But Boehner had trouble retaining a law firm that would take the case because of the political furor over the controversial health care law. ""Time after time, the President has chosen to ignore the will of the American people and re-write federal law on his own without a vote of Congress.  That's not the way our system of government was designed to work,"" Boehner said in statement on Friday. He added, ""if this President can get away with making his own laws, future presidents will have the ability to as well.  The House has an obligation to stand up for the Constitution, and that is exactly why we are pursuing this course of action."" News of the lawsuit came just minutes after Boehner held a press conference on Friday to respond to the President's plan to circumvent Congress in order to make sweeping changes to the nation's immigration system by executive order. The one-two punch from Boehner marks a new era of tension between Republicans who will officially take over Congress in January, and the President who has signaled that despite his party's losses in the midterms, he plans to proceed with his agenda without GOP cooperation. After two Washington firms pulled out of commitments to represent the House in recent months, Boehner hired George Washington law professor Jonathan Turley earlier this week. Turley is an expert on constitutional law and has appeared on multiple television networks as a legal analyst. Boehner and other top congressional Republican leaders are also contemplating a filing a separate lawsuit challenging the president's authority to take executive action to give 5 million immigrants temporary status. RELATED: Boehner hires third lawyer to sue Obama . The Obamacare complaint cites two specific actions by the Obama Administration regarding the implementation of the health care law.  The first zeroes in on the decision to delay for one year the requirement that employers with over 50 employees provide health care coverage or pay penalties. The second maintains it was illegal for the Treasury Department to transfer of billions of dollars that Congress has not approved to insurance companies to share the costs of providing new health plans. The case, filed in U.S. District court for the District of Columbia, names both the Secretaries of the Health and Human Services and the Treasury Departments, but not the President personally. House Republicans agreed that Obamacare's so-called ""employer mandate"" should be postponed. The House passed a bill last summer to do so, but GOP members maintain that the president's decision to act unilaterally on the delay circumvented Congress' role to pass laws. Under the Affordable Care Act insurance companies who provide health care coverage to new customers are eligible for receive money from a government cost-sharing program to offer discounted deductibles and co-payments. But Congress never approved any new funds for this purpose, and the suit says that an estimated $3 billion will be paid out by the Treasury Department in 2014 is an illegal action.  If Treasury continues to pay out money for this cost-sharing program a total of $178 billion could be paid to insurance companies over the next 10 years. The Republican lawsuit argues this ignores Congress' power of the purse under the Constitution. RELATED: Oops! Obamacare enrollment stats fudged . The White House dismissed the lawsuit in a statement shortly after its announcement. ""Instead of passing legislation to help expand the middle class and grow the economy, Speaker Boehner and House Republicans are spending hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars pursuing a lawsuit that is without any sound legal basis,"" said White House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi called the case ""meritless"" on Friday. ""The fact is, this lawsuit is a bald-faced attempt to achieve what Republicans have been unable to achieve through the political process.  The legislative branch cannot sue simply because they disagree with the way a law passed by a different Congress has been implemented.  It is clear, as one leading legal scholar put it, that this lawsuit is 'an embarrassing loser,'"" Pelosi said in a written statement . Some constitutional experts question whether the court will actually move forward with the case from House Republicans, and point out that it could be difficult to demonstrate that the Congress was damaged as an institution by the Administration's actions. The U.S. Supreme Court already announced this month that it was reviewing a separate legal challenge to Obamacare -- one focused on tax credits for those buying health care coverage on the federal insurance exchange. On immigration, Boehner said that Congress ""will not stand idle as the President undermines the rule of law, "" but gave no specifics on how congressional Republicans would respond to the President's executive action. Boehner told reporters that by moving ahead with unilateral action, the president chose to ""deliberately sabotage any chance of enacting bipartisan reform that he claims to seek."" In a less than five minute press conference on Capitol Hill, the Speaker said he told the President on Thursday ""he's damaging the presidency itself."" Pressed if congressional Republicans would try to block the president's executive actions by moving legislation to strip funding from federal agencies, Boehner sidestepped the question and instead said he was reviewing various actions with his members. ""The House will in fact act,"" the Speaker promised. Due to deep divisions inside the House GOP conference there is no consensus yet on how to try to block the president's plan. Many conservatives want to attach a provision to a must pass spending bill to strip funding for federal agencies to carry out the president's plan. But the chairman of the spending panel argues that is impossible because the customs agency is self-funded through fees and doesn't need congressional appropriations.  And many Republicans on Capitol Hill worry another fight on a spending bill will lead to another government shutdown.   Others are pushing to sue the president, or vote on censuring him. The clock is ticking for Boehner -- government agencies run out of money on Dec. 11.","Boehner announced Friday his plans to sue the President over his health care law .

"Jeb Bush says he'll decide ""in short order"" if he will run for the White House in 2016 -- and in a preview of what could become his campaign themes, the Republican is advocating a more active foreign policy and an overhaul of U.S. entitlement programs. ""I'm thinking about running for president, and I'll make up my mind in short order -- you know, not that far out into the future, I don't know the exact time line,"" Bush, the former Florida governor, brother of one president and son of another, said Monday night at an event hosted by the Wall Street Journal. He said his decision on whether to seek the Republican nomination will hinge on whether he can ""lift people's spirits and not get sucked into the vortex,"" and -- perhaps more importantly, he said -- whether ""the sacrifice for my family is tolerable."" ""I don't know if I'd be a good candidate or a bad one. I kind of know how a Republican can win,"" he said. Bush added that Republicans need to take a more positive approach in 2016, and be practical enough about the national political landscape to ""lose the primary to win the general"" election. He then made a lengthy argument for a ""more active and engaged foreign policy,"" warning that a rebuilt military and aggressive intelligence gathering tactics are key to preventing ""jihadist attacks."" ""There is a growing sense that we can't withdraw from the world,"" he said. Bush's position puts him at odds with more libertarian potential 2016 GOP hopefuls, like Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who have criticized the National Security Agency's surveillance efforts. He said intelligence tactics, the use of the military and other foreign policy issues, including free trade, could ""probably become a bigger issue"" in the 2016 campaign than he'd expected several months ago. ""The world is being disrupted, some in good ways and some in really bad ways, and but for us, there is no source of stability that allows that transformation to take place in a peaceful way,"" Bush said. Bush also delved into a host of domestic issues during his 45-minute discussion with Jerry Seib, the Wall Street Journal's Washington bureau chief -- on each one, eventually turning to the broader theme making the United States ""young and dynamic again."" On immigration, he argued for ""an economically driven system"" that would allow businesses to more easily move foreigners with the skills they need into the country. On energy, he said North America could end its reliance on overseas oil in five years with an ""all-in"" policy that includes oil exploration on federal lands, approving the Keystone XL pipeline, speeding up natural gas export terminal approvals and potentially allowing crude oil exports. He argued broadly for a simplified tax code and regulatory rules, and said education requires a ""radical transformation."" ""Then we could actually do the other big thing, which is not going to happen any time soon, which is entitlement reform. ... No developed country in the world has achieved this, and if we do it, we'll be young and dynamic,"" he said, adding that the United States could join the ranks of rapidly developing economies like Brazil, India and China. ""I think it'll be the means by which we see a rising income for the middle class again. Our spirits will be lifted,"" he said.","Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush says he'll decide soon if he will run for president in 2016 .

"Next time you're on the go and your phone is running out of juice, try a phone box. No, not for calling. To charge your phone. One of London's famous red telephone boxes has been painted green and transformed into a solar-powered charging station, as part of a design competition. The so-called ""Solarbox"" can be found in central London's Tottenham Court Road, and there are plans for more to be opened by early 2015. The Solarbox has chargers for Samsung, BlackBerry and the iPhones 4, 5 and 6. It can power an estimated 100 devices a day through its roof-mounted solar panel. It was designed by London School of Economics graduates Harold Craston and Kirsty Kenney, in response to a competition run by the Mayor of London. Their eco-friendly invention won them $8,000 and a spot in a mentorship scheme in the Mayor's Low Carbon Entrepreneur competition, making it possible to pilot their new business in London's streets. The kiosk funds itself by advertising, and using the service is free. Its inventors say the costs to run the machine are low -- it requires only basic maintenance such as cleaning, and initial costs of installing each Solarbox is forecast to be recouped within three months. The two wanted to use their interest in renewable energy to provide a service that people would really need. ""We've all been caught out -- phone battery life just can't keep up with the pace of our modern lives,"" Kenney said. ""By using solar power and repurposing old phone boxes we have been able to provide a real solution in an environmentally friendly way,"" she said. The rise of the smart phone has made thousands of the UK capital's phone boxes redundant, except for tourists looking for photo opportunities. The Solarbox is not the only unused phone box to be transformed into a new creation -- there are phone box libraries, sofas and even shower booths. Redundant phone boxes in Sydney, New York and other cities are being turned into free Wi-Fi hotspots, while several villages in England have equipped theirs with defibrillators.","London's red phone boxes are being turned into a solar-powered phone charging boxes .

"Benghazi, Libya (CNN) -- Hip-hop artists don't often smile, so it was no surprise that Libyan rapper MC Swat scowled suspiciously when I first walked into his cramped, cigarette smoke-filled studio in a former government building in Benghazi. This is where MC Swat, 23, has been writing scathing lyrics about the Gadhafi regime ever since Libya's uprising began in February. Libyan musicians and artists probably have a right to be wary of strangers. For decades, they say, they feared agents and paid informants of Moammar Gadhafi's repressive regime who reported to the government any work they deemed hostile to the state. When asked what would happen if he rapped his anti-regime lyrics prior to Libya's uprising, MC Swat said, ""I would be shot to death like Tupac,"" referring to the American rapper killed in 1996. But here in Benghazi, the opposition's de facto capital, there's no sign of Gadhafi's loyalists anymore -- or the fear that kept artists like MC Swat quiet for so long. A newfound freedom of expression has sparked an explosion in revolutionary music and art. Much of it takes place in a five-story building -- a government building turned cultural center -- that is steps away from the Mediterranean Sea. The building's hallways are covered with art and anti-regime cartoons, and the rooms are often buzzing through the wee hours of the morning with dozens of young revolutionary artists at work. ""Tomorrow we will take over our land,"" MC Swat raps in his second-floor studio, his DJ and machine gun-toting friend by his side. ""Moammar, we're coming with a mass revolution."" A few doors down, 26-year-old Saleh Dreisi sketches a giant caricature of Gadhafi. On the third floor, the rock band Guys Underground practices its latest song dedicated to the revolution. ""When you get in this building, you're going to find yourself in another world,"" said Marrawan Gargoun, the lead singer for Guys Underground. ""It's like being Alice in Wonderland. It's an amazing feeling I've never had in my life."" ""It feels like we're touching freedom,"" said MC Swat, who often sleeps overnight in his studio. The revolution's young artists say they represent the real Libya, and they bristle at allegations that Libya's rebels include elements of al Qaeda and Islamist extremists. ""You can find men with beards, but they're respectful Muslims,"" MC Swat said. ""They're not terrorists. You can see they have weapons, but they're fighting for our freedom. They're not al Qaeda."" Gagoun said, ""We were buried for 42 years, but this is the true Libya.""","A newfound freedom of speech has been embraced by Libyan musicians and artists .

"(CNN) -- There is no word more reviled in America than ""Ebola,"" especially since the death of Thomas Eric Duncan, the Liberian national who had traveled to Dallas. But as Ebola has spread, it has become increasingly clear that if there is to be any chance of stopping the disease -- not only here in America, but across the world -- then the United States must lead through inspiring example. Unfortunately, the response of some institutions that should know better has been anything but inspiring. First, this idea of a travel ban. Amidst numerous calls for a ban on air travel to and from West Africa, including from Texas Gov. Rick Perry, it is worth noting that West Africa is not a single country, but a region comprised of 15 nations. And while Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone have been ravaged by the disease, Nigeria (20 cases) and Senegal (one case) have contained the disease, while Ghana, Togo, Cameroon and the other countries in this subregion of Africa have not reported any cases at all. Should the U.S. follow the lead of countries, including Jamaica, which have instituted such a travel ban? The trouble is that doing so would give us a false sense of security, and at a huge cost. In spite of the hundreds, if not thousands, of Americans that are volunteering on the frontline to fight this disease, only one infected person has so far made it into the United States. And while it is true that the virus has also been contracted by Duncan's caregivers, the hospital appears to have had a golden opportunity to halt the disease in its tracks here, when Duncan reportedly told staff about his symptoms. Perhaps worse than the heated rhetoric over a travel ban has been the way some of our academic institutions -- supposedly bastions of knowledge against ignorance -- have themselves been overreacting. Take the widely publicized case of Navarro College, a school in Texas, which reportedly rescinded admissions to Nigerian students based on a school policy of ""not accepting international students from countries with Ebola cases."" Meanwhile, Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland recently reportedly withdrew an invitation to Richard Besser, ABC News' chief health editor, who was scheduled to speak at the university on the need for good communication during health crises, citing his September visit to West Africa. Syracuse University for its part has also uninvited Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist Michel du Cille from participating in its fall workshop for journalism students, despite his having passed the 21-day Ebola incubation period without showing any symptoms and having accompanied CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden to Congress. These institutions appear to be choosing to err not only on the side of caution, but of fear. More encouragingly, President Barack Obama has appointed an Ebola czar, Ron Klain, to help the United States tackle the problem. But if he is to make a success of his assignment, he will need to enlist the help of West African communities within the United States. Doing so will require reassuring these communities that they will not be stigmatized, but instead will be treated fairly -- even in cases where there are suspected or confirmed Ebola cases. My own experience working with the Clinton Health Access Initiative in HIV-ravaged parts of Swaziland in southern Africa showed me firsthand the perils of panic and stigmatization in an epidemic, and how these could drive people into the shadows, even if their illness is not actually related to Ebola. As with any epidemic, simple, clear and fact-based mass education is important. I was part of Nigeria's virtual EbolaAlert.Org team that leveraged mobile technology and social media to help create mass awareness and respond in real time to questions, concerns, tweets and rumors before Nigeria was able to contain the spread of the disease. The United States, with its huge technological advantage, needs to do even better and quickly embark on a social education campaign about the disease and help to allay concerns. Ultimately, we must remember that we live in a truly global world, and simplistic measures such as banning flights to and from West Africa won't resolve these issues. And welcome as their assistance is, the United States will need to do more than just send soldiers to West Africa to address the immediate crisis. The United States should also ensure personnel are available to help develop social infrastructure, especially in Liberia. We are all in this together -- and that is the only way we can beat this virus. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Idris Ayodeji Bello .","U.S. response to Ebola is key for setting global example, writes Idris Ayodeji Bello .
But too many institutions are overreacting, Bello says .

"Cottonwood, Arizona (CNN) -- The cheering was raucous and the applause thunderous for a man who makes few public appearances. As he made his way gingerly across a gravel park, where he had just dedicated a nearly 40-foot statue representing the ""Soul of the Earth,"" a voice shouted out: ""I love you, Ilchi Lee."" Lee, a South Korean businessman, is the founder of a national chain of yoga and wellness centers called Dahn Yoga. The company teaches that its physical exercises ""can restore the vibrations of the body and brain to their original, healthy frequencies,"" according to a video introduction on its Web site. But Dahn Yoga is now defending itself from allegations by former employees that it is ""a totalistic, high-demand cult group"" that demands large sums of money from its followers and enshrines Lee as an ""absolute spiritual and temporal leader."" A lawsuit, filed in a federal court in Arizona, says that recruits ""are unknowingly subjected to an intensive program of psychological manipulation, indoctrination and various techniques of coercive thought reform designed to induce them to become Ilchi Lee's disciples and devote themselves to serving him and his 'vision.' "" Jade Harrelson, one of more than two dozen plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said Dahn leaders ""prey upon people like me who are ignorant about the way money works."" The company denies the allegations and calls the plaintiffs ""disgruntled former employees."" ""In our 30-year history, we have helped millions of people lead healthier and happier lives,"" corporate spokesman Joseph Alexander told CNN. Dahn Yoga set up its first shop in the United States in 1991, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It now has 127 storefront centers in the United States, more than 1,000 worldwide, and Forbes magazine estimates the company's 2009 profits at $34 million. Dahn Yoga teaches that what it calls brain wave vibration can ease some of the debilitating symptoms of illnesses such as diabetes and arthritis. Its publicity materials feature praise for Lee from a variety of sources, including Oscar Arias, Costa Rica's president and a Nobel Peace Prize winner; and Broadway producer/choreographer Tommy Tune. In addition, Elkhonon Goldberg, a clinical professor of neurology at New York University's medical school, praises the work of the International Brain Education Association, a group Lee founded. ""IBREA is in a unique position to disseminate knowledge and to serve as a very effective platform for numerous worthwhile projects,"" Goldberg is quoted on the Dahn Web site as saying. ""Ilchi Lee should be applauded for his pioneering creative vision in conceiving and launching this innovative organization with a truly international outreach."" Goldberg did not respond to requests for comment from CNN. Harrelson and other former employees say Dahn Yoga instructors coerced them into taking out student loans, then transferring the funds to the company. Payments began in small amounts, she said, then progressively increased as fees for training and courses became more expensive. Harrelson said she eventually paid about $40,000 to Dahn. Alexander said no one was ever coerced into giving money to Dahn Yoga. The former employees ""have misinterpreted natural business cycles, natural business goals, as some type of undue pressure,"" he said. ""We make no excuses and no apology for the fact that we are a business,"" Alexander said. The plaintiffs, he said, ""are after one thing -- they are after money."" And Dahn Yoga attorney Alan Kaplan added, ""Let's make it clear. My client, Mr. Lee, is not a cult leader. Dahn Yoga is not a cult."" But Ryan Kent, the lawyer who filed suit on behalf of Harrelson and 26 other former employees in May, said Dahn Yoga leaders indoctrinate followers, then ""take advantage of you and take all your money."" Harrelson also said Lee singled her out for special attention and eventually sexually assaulted her while she was living and working in Seoul, South Korea. She said she trusted Lee and saw him as a father figure, eventually following him to Seoul -- where, she says, he assaulted her one night in 2007 at his apartment. ""In my mind, there was no possible way I could have physically or verbally resisted him,"" Harrelson told CNN. ""To say no to him was to say no to his soul. I became numb, and so what happened, happened not at my consent."" Harrelson said she never filed a police report. The first time she publicly made the allegation was when she and other former employees filed suit in early 2009. Dahn Yoga's U.S. operations are now based near Sedona, Arizona, about 20 miles from Cottonwood -- where Lee appeared in December to dedicate the 39-foot statue of ""Mago."" The name is Korean for ""Soul of the Earth,"" the mother figure in a seventh-century creation legend Lee cites as his inspiration. It was a rare appearance for Lee, who is seldom seen in public and routinely travels with a retinue of bodyguards. CNN requested an on-camera interview with Lee through his representatives, but was turned down. When approached at a dedication ceremony in this small Arizona town, he was surrounded by bodyguards, one of whom said the Dahn Yoga founder needed a translator to understand the questions. When a CNN photographer who speaks Korean translated, Lee said it was the first time he had heard of the sex assault allegation. Then his bodyguards forced the camera lens to point toward the ground, and Lee continued to the ribbon-cutting. Later, his attorney said any claims of sexual assault were not true, and ""We are confident we will get those claims dismissed in court."" Harrelson, who goes by ""Jade,"" and college friend Liza Miller also say they were strongly urged to undergo extreme physical training at Dahn Yoga's retreat center in Sedona -- training they say left both women at the brink of exhaustion. One of the exercises, known as ""bow training,"" involved deep knee bends to the floor to a prone position and back up again, with hands raised high over their heads. Miller, who has joined the lawsuit, says once she had to do 3,000 of the exercises -- ""Which took about 10 hours, and we didn't eat or drink during that time."" ""People were screaming, people were throwing up, people were running away,"" Miller said. ""People were rolling around, moaning, crying, wailing -- there was a lot of emotional distress. We were taught that because of this bow training, we were cleaning what was blocking us, to connect to our soul."" Dahn Yoga calls Miller's description of the exercise inaccurate. ""These are meditation practices,"" Alexander said. ""They are common throughout Asia, especially in Korea. Generally, people do a smaller number of bows, and they build up to more. I know of no one who does 3,000 bows on a regular basis."" And Dahn Yoga instructor Genia Sullivan told CNN, ""The practices that we practice are very helpful."" ""They empower people to really use everything they have to become the best person they can be, and I've benefited greatly from it,"" Sullivan said. Other Dahn employees sent CNN e-mails supportive of the organization and its leader while this report was being prepared. All praised Lee, with one woman saying she had given her life to him and to the organization. The writers all condemned their former colleagues who have gone to court, and they deny the company is a cult. By all accounts, Dahn Yoga is a booming business. Lee is revered by most of its adherents. But some former employees who say they once loved the organization are now saying far different things. ""The problem was way at the top, at the very, very top, things are completely dishonest,"" Miller said. ""And that information trickled down so that everyone is believing one thing, which is a total lie.""","Former employees allege Dahn Yoga is ""a totalistic, high-demand cult group""

"One of the oddest features in the new Kindle Fire tablets is decidedly retro: a button that summons a human tech support representative on your screen. When you press the Mayday button on a Kindle Fire HDX, a small box appears on the tablet. In the box is live video of a friendly Amazon customer support person. You can slide his or her face around your screen so it's not blocking any key buttons or settings, and then ask away. ""How do I set up my e-mail account?"" a new Kindle Fire owner might wonder. The representative can see, control and draw little arrows and lines on the screen. ""First, open this mail app,"" they'll say while a bright orange arrow appears on on you screen pointing to the mail app. If you'd rather they just take over, they can navigate and press the buttons for you, all while you watch it happen (and admire the look of concentration on the rep's face) in real time. More on the new Kindle Fires . Offering up a live human is the exact opposite of what many tech companies are doing for tech support. In addition to directing people to online help forums and detailed help documents, some major companies such as eBay are using automated online assistants. The programs show an illustration of a friendly face on your screen and use artificial intelligence to mimic a real customer service interaction. Humans are still present at 800 numbers (after you navigate a maze of automate options that thin out the herd), and on the other end of live chat support, but typically they can't see your screen without jumping through some hoops, and there's no face-to-face interaction. ""What we wanted to do was to elevate that tech support customer experience by bringing a tech support person ... directly on your screen and giving them the ability to see what you're doing,"" said Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos at a demo of the feature in Seattle. More than being able to see someone's face, having a representative automatically see and control your screen is the best way to provide customer support. (After years of long, arduous phone calls talking my mom through computer problems, I finally set it up so I could control her screen from across the country and fix any problems myself. It was the best idea I've ever had.) ""Tech support is very difficult to do over the phone,"" said Bezos. First the customer has to describe the problem and what they're seeing. Then the representative has to describe what they're supposed to do to fix it. The potential for miscommunication and confusion is great. Because it's easier, screen sharing will greatly cut down on the amount of time it takes to solve a problem. So while there will likely be many more requests for help using Mayday than an 800 number, the time savings could even out. At least at first, the feature will be ripe for some fun, unorthodox uses. Lonely people might just dial up a rep to chat, ask about their favorite movies and ask about their day. Luckily the video connection is only one way and they cannot see the customer, only their screen. Amazon isn't afraid of the goofy people. ""I expect in the early days, we'll see lots of people using this feature just to try it out, just to show it off to their friends, and that's great. We're excited about that. We want that to happen,"" said Bezos. The tech support representatives are trained to be extra friendly and accommodating. For example, customers are encouraged to ask them about movie or app recommendations. In the battle of iOS versus Android, Apple products are given credit as easier to learn and use while Android tablets and phones offer more customization and control. Even though the Fire runs a highly customized, nearly unrecognizable version of the Android Jelly Bean mobile operating system, it appears to be aiming for a more Apple-like ease of use. The company has always prided itself on providing very good customer service, and previously, Kindle owners could call a representative 24 hours a day at an 800 number. To start, Mayday will use the same customer service representatives already in place around the world but give them the new technology and training. If it takes off, Amazon will bring in more people. The cost of the staff, training and technology required to provide instant access to a live person 24 hours a day, seven days a week must be sizable. But like the Kindle Fire hardware itself, Amazon does is not trying to make money off it. The goal is to make it easier for people to use the tablet. The more they use it, the more time they will spend in the Amazon ecosystem, and the more money they will spend on Amazon content and products. Happy customers equal more profit.","The Kindle Fire HDX has built-in live tech support .

"Hands down, it's the most important monthly economic report in the race for the White House. And April's numbers from the Labor Department didn't provide President Obama a lot to brag about. ""After the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, our businesses have now created more than 4.2 million new jobs over the last 26 months, more than 1 million jobs in the six months alone. So that's the good news,"" Obama said Friday at an event in northern Virginia. But the president went on to say, ""There are still a lot of folks out of work, which means we gotta do more. If we're going to recover all the jobs lost during the recession, and if we're going to build a secure economy that strengthens the middle class, then we're going to have to do more."" Consider this: No sitting president facing an unemployment rate more than 8% has won another term since Franklin D. Roosevelt. So the headline from the Labor Department report Friday morning that the nation's unemployment level edged down from 8.2% in March to 8.1% in April sure seemed like good news for an incumbent president fighting for re-election. Especially since just about every poll indicates that the economy remains the top issue on the minds of Americans and that jobs remain the top economic concern. CNNMoney.com: Why Obama can't match the Reagan recovery . But the Labor Department also reported that the number of jobs rose last month by 115,000, much lower than many economists had predicted. According to the report, 342,000 workers dropped out of the labor force, with the labor force participation rate, now at 63.6%, at its lowest level since 1981. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee was quick to react to the jobs numbers. ""It's a terrible and very disappointing report this morning. Clearly the American people are wondering why this recovery isn't happening faster, what's taking years and years for the recovery to occur. And we seem to be slowing down, not speeding up. This is not progress,"" Mitt Romney said Friday in an interview on Fox News just minutes after the 8:30 a.m. ET release of the Labor Department report. Romney says no celebration until 4% unemployment rate . ""A lot of American people are having difficult times, and this is not good news this morning,"" added the former Massachusetts governor, who argued the reason the rate dropped was because more people are leaving the workforce. Republicans quick to react to jobs report . Romney's strategy is simple: Make the election a referendum on the president's record on the economy and jobs, and argue that Obama isn't doing a good job on creating jobs. With six months to go until Election Day, a top Republican strategist says the jobs report spells trouble for the president. ""A disappointing jobs report means two things: One, President Obama is more likely to lose his job. Now, this election will increasingly become a referendum on Obama's performance. Voters may or may not believe Mitt Romney can turn things around, but it is becoming clearer that Obama's plan isn't going to cut it,"" says GOP strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos. ""Two, to win, President Obama has to run the most brutal, negative, polarizing campaign in history -- on every subject but the economy. He has to pit young against old, rich against poor, women against men, and try to divide the country on other issues. I don't think that's the kind of country we want to be,"" said Castellanos, who was a top media adviser for Romney's 2008 nomination bid. ""Anytime you have to explain bad news, you've already lost. The Obama campaign has done the best they can with stubbornly high unemployment, talking about the number of jobs created and not the number of people who don't have jobs. But this doesn't help the general sense of unease about the economy among middle class Americans,"" says Rich Galen, who ran Newt Gingrich's press operation when he was speaker of the House and advised Fred Thompson's 2008 Republican presidential bid. But be careful what you wish for, says Democratic strategist and CNN contributor Paul Begala. ""Every time there's bad economic news for the middle class, the Champagne corks pop at one of Mitt Romney's many mansions. The bad job numbers are bad news for President Obama -- and for all Americans. So the GOP has to be careful not to celebrate bad times,"" says Begala, who was a top adviser in the Clinton White House and who now is a senior adviser to Priorities USA, the pro-Obama super PAC. So which candidate does the public think will do a better job turning things around? A CNN/ORC International poll conducted last month indicated that Americans were split on which candidate could best jumpstart the economy, with 44% saying Obama would be more likely to get the economy moving and 42% saying that Romney would do a better job to stimulate the economy. But the race for the White House is a battle for states and their electoral votes. And in two of the biggest and arguably most important battleground states, new surveys from Quinnipiac University indicate that when it comes to the economy, Romney has a slight advantage over the president. Keep your eyes on the monthly unemployment reports between now and November. The numbers will be extremely telling.","The jobs report is the most important monthly economic report in the White House race .
Obama on report: ""There are still a lot of folks out of work, which means we gotta do more""
Romney: ""It's a terrible and very disappointing report""

"He suffered greatly in his final months, but Nelson Mandela's last breaths were peaceful, says his eldest daughter, Maki Mandela. She describes the end as a ""beautiful passing on"" but says his death and burial came as a relief to her after his long health struggles. ""There were times I was telling the doctors I think enough is enough,"" Maki Mandela says in an exclusive interview with CNN from her home in Johannesburg. ""As doctors they had their duty to try everything up to the last moment, but for me as a daughter it was excruciating watching that."" The former South African President, who led his country out of decades of apartheid after being imprisoned 27 years, died in December at age 95. For a year before his death, her father was on dialysis for kidney failure and a ventilator to help him breathe. He was fed intravenously through tubes into his stomach, and his arms and hands grew swollen due to the intravenous antibiotics and other medications he was receiving. Bedridden and incontinent, the Nobel Peace Prize winner had no quality of life, his daughter says. Recently writing in favor of assisted dying, former Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu questioned the treatment of Nelson Mandela in his final months, saying it was ""disgraceful."" In an editorial for Britain's The Observer, Tutu singled out South African President Jacob Zuma and other politicians who took photos with a clearly confused and ill Mandela and called it an ""affront to his dignity."" Maki Mandela says she constantly questioned her father's team of state medical doctors about why his life was being prolonged. ""I said, 'Guys, when do we accept that we have reached the end and we can't play God?' "" But she says she accepted the doctors' decisions and knows they were bound to ""try everything."" She says she couldn't fault the care and dedication of the team of medics and nurses who looked after her father 24 hours a day. ""They treated him with dignity and respect,"" she says. Throughout his long illness, his heart remained strong, perhaps not surprising for a man who dedicated his life to the struggle against apartheid and helped to lead his nation to democracy. ""When the heart started giving, it was a matter of days,"" Maki Mandela says. The anti-apartheid icon was buried on his farm in Qunu, a remote rural area in the Eastern Cape where he grew up. ""That whole place is a quarry. We had to dynamite the place for us to create his burial place,"" Maki Mandela says, adding that her father chose the location. In keeping with traditions of his Xhosa tribe, Nelson Mandela was laid to rest on a reed mat on the floor of the grave, as if he had gone to sleep like his ancestors did in generations past. The architecture of the grave is such that his coffin is not covered with soil, which is considered bad luck. Maki Mandela says she and most family members have not been to visit his grave recently but hope to do so soon. ""People are starting to say, make requests, 'Can we visit the grave?' "" she says. She says it's too early now but expects the family will open the area to visitors and tourists in a year or so. Plans are in place for a visitors' center and memorial garden, where tourists will be able to walk around the grave and see it from a viewing point. And in homage to Nelson Mandela's royal lineage and his monumental legacy, his family has given the grave site the nickname of ""The Big House.""","Daughter says Nelson Mandela's death was a relief after he suffered so much .

"(CNN) -- A visit to the Aloha State rates high on many a travel wish list. Warm, floral breezes skip across the remote and spectacular Hawaiian Islands, home to some of the world's most beautiful beaches, lush rainforests, lava-laced volcanoes, and more. iReporter Adrienne Papania, of Cincinnati, Ohio, recently returned from an island-hopping Hawaiian getaway. Papania, 58, and her sister, brother and sister-in-law jumped between Oahu, Kauai, Maui and the Big Island. The group stayed mostly in oceanfront two-bedroom condos. Their experience at Kahana Village in Lahaina, Maui, was particularly welcoming, complete with a festive Mai Tai party with live Hawaiian music. ""Honestly, though, while all of our accommodations were great, we were not in our rooms much since we had a lot of exploring to do,"" Papania said. Papania shared her favorite discoveries on iReport.com: . Don't-miss experiences . Oahu: Hike up Diamond Head Crater -- It wasn't an easy trek for us, but the views once we arrived were breathtaking. Kauai: Helicopter tour of the island -- You can't get to some parts of the island very easily without hiking, so the ride provides a panoramic view of what we would not have seen.  This trip was very much worth the money! Maui: Sunrise at Haleakala -- We were told it would be cold when we did the sunrise at Haleakala... and it was!  Fifty degrees doesn't sound too bad, but we sure were freezing even with jackets and blankets.  But the experience is not to be missed. Big Island: Black Sand Beach -- This was an unexpected stop on our way to the Volcanoes National Park.  The sand there is literally black, a byproduct of the lava that surrounds the island.  It was absolutely gorgeous, and there were several huge sea turtles close to the shore. All islands: Fabulous sunsets . Share your recent travel tales on iReport.com: Just back from . First impressions. Did they change? Impressions changed dramatically from island to island.  They each are so different and beautiful, from the populous, energy-filled Oahu, to the lush environment of Kauai, the valleys of Maui and the lava terrain of the Big Island. Travel Snapshots: Natural beauty shines in Aloha State . Lasting memory . For me, the most significant lasting memory (and it's hard to pick one) was the Black Sand Beach.  It was something I had never seen before, and it was just beautiful beyond words. Three adjectives that capture this place . Scenic; distinctive; adventure-filled. (And I'll throw in beautiful!) Biggest surprise . My biggest surprise was the helicopter ride on Kauai.  We would have missed a lot of the beauty of that island, especially the Na Pali Coast and the Waimea Canyon. I would highly recommend [Blue Hawaiian Helicopters]. I was very apprehensive about the idea of a helicopter ride and even took a motion sickness prevention pill just in case. But our pilot, Dawn, who was a former Coast Guard pilot, did a great job. The ride didn't come cheap, but it was a ride of a lifetime! We all agreed we would do it again, maybe on the Big Island next time. Most delicious food or drink . Our favorite meal was in Hilo on the Big Island at a place called the Hilo Bay Cafe.  We had macadamia nut-crusted scallops, and they were absolutely delicious. Our favorite drinks were at the luau in Old Lahaina on Maui, where they served a tasty frozen lava flow. You use rum, coconut rum, strawberries, banana, pineapple juice and coconut cream. It's a recipe we hope to replicate at home soon! The whole night was a great experience, starting with receiving our gorgeous fuchsia/white plumeria leis; watching the natives display their craft skills around the perimeter of the venue (making jewelry, woodworking, weaving palms into flowers and animals, making poi, etc.); watching the removal of the pig from the imu; a great meal; and finally the show. The dancers were incredible, and all the songs followed a tale they wove into a story of their Hawaiian heritage. Have you been to Hawaii?

"Tel Hazor in northern Israel has long been a treasure trove for archeologists, but a recent discovery of part of a 4,000-year-old Egyptian sphinx has been a most unexpected find. Inexplicably buried far from Egypt, the paws of a sphinx statue, resting on its base, have been unearthed with an inscription in hieroglyphs naming King Mycerinus. The pharaoh ruled in 2500 BC and oversaw the construction of one of the three Giza pyramids, where he was enshrined. ""Once in a lifetime you find something like this,"" says Amnon Ben-Tor, the director of the excavation and a professor at Hebrew University, which sponsors the archeological digging. ""This is of extreme importance from many points of view, since it is the only sphinx of this king known in the world -- even in Egypt. It is also the only monumental piece of Egyptian sculpture found anywhere in the Levant,"" he said, referring to the region spanning the east of the Mediterranean Sea. Ben-Tor says the sphinx was deliberately broken, as were about 10 other Egyptian statues that had been previously found there. When cities fell, he said, most statues had their heads and hands cut off. ""This is what happened to this one here. He lost his hands,"" Ben-Tor said. The full sphinx is estimated to have been a meter tall, weighing half a ton. Read more: Ramadan sees rise in binge eating . The team will continue to search for the rest of its body on the archeological site covering 200 acres -- even if it takes 600 years, the length of time Ben-Tor expects for the site to be fully excavated. As for the biggest question of all -- how the sphinx got to Tel Hazor -- it will likely remain a mystery. ""Maybe this was a gift which the Egyptian king sent to the local king of Hazor. Maybe. To prove it? Impossible,"" Ben-Tor said. Tel Hazor was the capital of the city of Canaan 4,000 years ago, its population reaching 20,000. Located on the route connecting Egypt and Babylon, the city prospered. Excavations first began in the 1950s, and it is now recognized as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. During most of the year, this remote part of Israel is quiet. But every summer, archeologists, students and volunteers descend on Tel Hazor to uncover how the ancients lived. The site has become important for biblical archeology, which aims to illuminate events in the Bible. Read more: Spectacular train stations to transform Riyadh . There is no shortage of artifacts here, with discoveries seemingly made daily, including clay pots and bowls. But the real goal is to use them to understand civilizations. ""The documents we found at Hazor tell us about the people, tell us about their names, about their culture, about their cult, about marriages, about divorces, about economies,"" Ben-Tor says. ""All these things we learned from out at Hazor.  We did not just find mute stones.  We have to make these stones speak.  And that's what we do."" But experts and volunteers say part of the rewards of working on the excavation is getting to know a different group of people -- those still living. Shlomit Bechar, a doctoral candidate in archeology at Hebrew University, serves as a supervisor of volunteers over the summer. ""There's also a story behind every find.  A human story.  Not just ancient humans, but also the volunteers that we have in the area,"" she said. Coming here is considered an experience of a lifetime, even though the work is hard and there is no pay. One of the volunteers, Robin Jenkins, is not an archeologist but has been coming to Tel Hazor from Canada for 10 years. He is a self-described archeology junkie on a ""workcation."" ""You get to meet people from all over the world,"" he said. ""Israel's a great country.  This site is really interesting.  Every year something new comes up.""","A 4,000-year-old Egyptian sphinx was an unexpected find in an Israel excavation site, Tel Hazor .

"(CNN) -- A Rutgers University student who apparently committed suicide was the unknowing target of an internet broadcast showing him in a sexual encounter, New Jersey authorities said Wednesday. Two other Rutgers students have been charged with invasion of privacy after they allegedly placed a camera in 18-year-old Tyler Clementi's dorm room without his knowledge and then broadcast Clementi's sexual encounter, according to the Middlesex County prosecutor's office. ""If the charges are true, these actions gravely violate the university's standards of decency and humanity,"" Rutgers President Richard L. McCormick said in a statement Wednesday. Your say: Invasion of privacy or cyber bullying? Although Clementi's body has not been found, an attorney for the Ridgewood, New Jersey, family said Wednesday, ""On behalf of the family of Tyler Clementi, I can confirm that Tyler committed suicide last week by jumping from the George Washington Bridge."" ""The family and their representatives are cooperating fully with the ongoing criminal investigations of two Rutgers University students,"" attorney Paul Mainardi added. A law enforcement source confirmed with CNN that while a body has not yet been recovered, Clementi's wallet and cell phone were found on the bridge that spans the Hudson River between New Jersey and New York. Dharun Ravi, 18, of Plainsboro, New Jersey, and Molly Wei, 18, of Princeton, New Jersey, are each charged with two counts of invasion of privacy for the September 19 broadcast, according to the prosecutor's office. Two more counts of invasion of privacy were leveled against Ravi for an attempt to videotape another encounter involving Clementi on September 21, the prosecutor's office said. It is unclear exactly how Rutgers campus police learned that a camera had been placed in Clementi's room and used to broadcast his encounter. Both Wei and Ravi surrendered to campus police -- Wei surrendered on Monday and was released on her own recognizance; Ravi surrendered Tuesday and was released on $25,000 bail. Ravi's attorney did not return phone calls from CNN. According to the Middlesex County prosecutor's office, Wei apparently had not retained an attorney as of Wednesday. If convicted, both could face up to five years in prison. Police at the university, which has its main campus in New Brunswick, are investigating the case, university president McCormick said in his statement Wednesday. ""I deeply regret that today we learned from the family of one of our students that they believe their son has committed suicide. We are profoundly saddened by this report, and our hearts and prayers are with the parents, family, and friends of this young man, who had started at Rutgers this semester as a first-year student on the New Brunswick campus,"" McCormick said in the statement. He added, ""While there is a lot of information being communicated, we don't have all the facts in this case.""","Rutgers student Tyler Clementi committed suicide last week, his family says .

"(CNN)You have to love Malala. The 17-year-old Pakistani advocate for girls' education who, on Friday, became the youngest winner of the Nobel Peace Prize told ""The Daily Show's"" Jon Stewart last year what she would do if she were confronted again by a member of the Taliban. ""I'll tell him how important education is and that I even want education for your children as well,"" she said. ""I'll tell him, 'That's what I want to tell you; now do what you want.' "" This from a girl who was shot in the head by the Taliban. For exercising her right to go to school. Malala Yousafzai was only 14 years old at the time -- and just 11 when she started blogging anonymously for the BBC about the struggles of life in Pakistan's Swat Valley. Stewart's response was priceless as well: ""I know your father is backstage and he's very proud of you, but would he be mad if I adopted you?"" It's not just him. The world has adopted Malala. Malala's journey from near death to the Nobel Peace Prize . She reminds us of the transformative power of education, especially for the 31 million primary-school-age girls, according to UNICEF, who aren't in school worldwide. And, as important, she is a beacon of hope -- a reminder that the human spirit holds in it immense possibility, warmth, humility and forgiveness. U.S. President Barack Obama used to fill that role, back when he won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009. Now, as bombs fall over Syria and Iraq, in an attempt to destroy a terrorist group that has beheaded Americans, it's hard to continue to see him that way these days. Malala is the world's new symbol of hope. Her crusade for education rights only seems to be getting stronger as the years pass. And in the world of ISIS and Boko Haram, the Nigerian group that kidnaps young girls and attacks their schools, she's needed now more than ever. That she shares the prize with Kailash Satyarthi, an Indian children's rights activist, makes this moment all the more significant. ""The Nobel Committee regards it as an important point for a Hindu and a Muslim, an Indian and a Pakistani, to join in a common struggle for education and against extremism,"" the committee said in a statement. The Nobel Committee praised Satyarthi as carrying on Gandhi's tradition of nonviolent resistance. And it called Malala's struggle ""heroic."" It's not hard to see why. ""Dear friends, on the 9th of October 2012, the Taliban shot me on the left side of my forehead. They shot my friends, too,"" Malala said at the United Nations in July 2013. ""They thought that the bullets would silence us. But they failed. ""And then, out of that silence came, thousands of voices. The terrorists thought that they would change our aims and stop our ambitions, but nothing changed in my life except this: Weakness, fear and hopelessness died. Strength, power and courage was born."" It's telling that, according to ABC News, Malala was planning to be in school Friday. That's true determination. It's the kind that hopefully will give more girls around the world the right to do the same.","Malala Yousafzai has become the youngest Nobel Peace Prize winner .

"Christianity is a religion frayed over the centuries into many denominations. On Sunday, Pope Francis and the head of a major one vowed to heal one of the church's oldest splits. The Great Schism of 1054 separated the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches. Both profess similar doctrine and worship in similar ways, but a millennium ago, Eastern Orthodoxy rejected the ultimate authority of the Pope. Francis and Patriarch Bartholomew I -- the spiritual leader of some 300 million Orthodox Christians worldwide -- signed a declaration on Sunday committing to unity between the two churches. Together, they celebrated a divine liturgy at the Patriarchal Church of St. George in Istanbul on Francis' last day in the predominantly Muslim nation -- his first trip there. Somber intonations and hymns reverberated through the church as the two spiritual leaders prayed and offered reflections and Francis tried to allay worries. Unity, not submission . Neither church will submit to nor assimilate the other, the Pope said in his homily, but they will work ""towards the restoration of full Communion."" ""I want to assure each one of you here that, to reach the desired goal of full unity, the Catholic Church does not intend to impose any conditions except that of the shared profession of faith,"" Francis said. He was at St. George's at the Patriarch's invitation, which he extended shortly after Francis' inauguration. Sunday's celebrations marked the feast of St. Andrew, the founder of the Eastern Church. He was also the older brother of St. Peter, the founding father of the Catholic Church . 'Blood of martyrdom' In his part of the call for unity, the Orthodox leader alluded to attacks by radical Islamists on Christians. ""We no longer have the luxury of isolated action,"" Bartholomew said. ""The modern persecutors of Christians do not ask which church their victims belong to. The unity that concerns us is regrettably already occurring in certain regions of the world through the blood of martyrdom."" Over the past decade, first al Qaeda and then ISIS have forced Christians to flee Iraq and Syria. Far fewer Christians remain in areas under ISIS control. Some rely on their faith in God; others pay terrorists a protection tax. Growing numbers, especially from Syria, have ended up in Turkey.The nation is reeling from the influx of around 1.5 million Syrian refugees, the vast majority Muslim. Religion is also splitting Turkey. Opponents fear its conservative government will weaken the secular identity of the post-Ottoman Empire. Instability rages at its border, with ISIS and its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, announcing their intention to take over large swaths of territory for their self-proclaimed Islamic State. Fourth pope in Turkey . Francis is the fourth pope to travel to Turkey, following in the footsteps of Paul VI, John Paul II and Benedict XVI. The Pope was also expected to meet with young people from the Salesian community from Turkey, the Middle East and Africa before heading  to the airport later Sunday. Salesians, the second largest Catholic order, help orphans and at-risk children, according to their website. On Friday, the first day of his visit, Francis called for religious tolerance and dialogue to counter extremism in the Middle East, as he met with Turkey's leaders. ""Fanaticism and fundamentalism, as well as irrational fears, which foster misunderstanding and discrimination, need to be countered by the solidarity of all believers,"" he said. The world is morally obligated to help Turkey care for the great number of refugees it has taken in, Francis said. Erdogan criticizes Islamophobia . In an address given in Francis' presence, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan highlighted what he said was a disturbing trend of increased racism and Islamophobia in the West, while Islamist extremism wracks parts of the Middle East. The world must come together if it wants to combat terrorism, he said. The Turkish leader also suggested the West should not turn a blind eye to abuses committed by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad while it pursues ISIS. The timing of the Pope's visit, in this period of unrest, is extremely significant, Erdogan added, voicing hope that it would lead to an ""auspicious era"" of improved relations in the world.","Pope Francis pushes for reunification with Orthodox Christians .

"In a world where computers are increasingly powerful and are concealed within ever more glossy slabs of aluminum, the Raspberry Pi (RPi) offers surprising proof for the virtue of moderation. Resembling little more than a credit card-sized scrap of exposed circuit board, the RPi is a fully programmable PC that runs a free, open-source Linux operating system, plugs into any TV, can power 3D graphics, connects to the Internet and, with a little ingenuity, be used to create your own personalized robot slave. The computer's miniature frame is crowded with two USB ports, an SD card slot, an Ethernet connection and microchip in the middle -- all powered by a universal USB mobile charger. Read related: Robotics kit for grown-up kids . Not only is it the world's smallest personal computer but, perhaps most importantly of all, at just $25 the RPi is also the world's cheapest. Eben Upton, the UK-based University of Cambridge professor and inventor behind the wallet-friendly PC, says he set out to create a computer so affordable that every child in Britain could have one. With its rough-around-the-edges aesthetic, however, he didn't expect it to catch on very fast and, in the early days of development, set a sales target of 10,000 units within his lifetime. But when the RPi launched in February of this year, demand far outran supply, and all 10,000 sold out immediately -- crashing the distributing websites in the process. Read related: The Rubik's Cube in numbers . It turned out there was a voracious appetite -- particularly among a growing class of DIY geeks -- for a cheap, easily-programmable, open-source piece of hardware that would allow them to let their imaginations run wild. The RPi has since be used to power everything from home-made jukeboxes to baby monitors to miniature near-space crafts and digital weather-stations. Now, far exceeding its inventor's original estimates, the RPi is set to sell as a million units within its first year of availability. In a revealing interview with CNN, Upton tells all about why everyone wants a slice of Raspberry Pi. CNN: What inspired you to invent the Raspberry Pi? Eben Upton: A group of us here at the University of Cambridge were involved in trying to find 17, 18-year-olds to come and study computer science and what we found every year was a reduction in the numbers. We went from 500 people in the 1990s applying for our 80 places, down to under 250  and, worse than that, the sorts of things those children knew how to do when they came in the door were much less impressive. Really Raspberry Pi is an attempt to try and reboot some of that 1980s computer industry feel that had been responsible for giving us this stream of very talented students. CNN: What in your view are the Pi's most distinguishing qualities? EU: I think we really have to say the big, distinct feature about Raspberry Pi is the cost. This is a device that comes in two variants, one that cost $25 and one that costs $35. These are designed to be the same price as a textbook; they're designed to be cheap enough that a child can buy on with their pocket money. They're designed to be cheap enough that you could equip a whole classroom for under a $1000. So, really the cheapness. Almost everything you can do with a Raspberry Pi, you can do with a conventional PC, but you'd be doing it at 10 times the cost. CNN: Did you have any idea what kind of response you'd get? EU: Absolutely not, I think the response has been staggering. Even a year ago we were thinking of this shifting 10,000 units over a lifetime. All we wanted was a few hundred more students -- or for the students we were getting to have had a little more experience when they came to the door. CNN: What was your own reaction when you heard how many you'd sold on the first day? EU: Terror, I guess. When you've scaled everything for a particular size and then you discover you have this enormous spike of demand, then you're always going to wonder if you can fill it. And there were big queues, there were back orders for months after that as we and our partners worked very hard to try and scale out production. CNN: You set out to sell primarily to schools for use by children in class, who's it actually being bought by? EU: Until September, it was being bought almost entirely by people like me -- technically literate adults who wanted to use it to do interesting projects. You know this is something you can plug your television into and play videos on; it's got stuff you can use to control a robot. For people like me this is gold dust. From September onwards we've started to see a swing round towards what we were hoping for, which is educational engagement -- individual children buying them and schools buying classroom sets of them. CNN: Any other surprise takers? EU: We're also starting to see some industrial applications. We're seeing people who have been buying $300 industrial computers saying ""hang on a second, why am I buying this special purpose computer when I can buy one of these. It does the same thing, it runs Unix. My software engineers can be very comfortable with it, why don't I just switch over to these?"" Another really interesting one that I should have anticipated was of course the developing world. These make very good entry-level productivity computers for the developing world, so we're starting to see an interest there as well. CNN: How are you able to sell it so cheaply? EU: One of things that allows us to hit our very low price point is that we have a very high level of integration -- there's just not that much stuff on the board. All of the main features are integrated onto the chip in the middle. It's our central processor and also our graphic processor that drives the display and does some of our peripheral functions, so that's the main chip. CNN: Do you remember the first time you took it into a school and what kind of reaction you got? EU: We were really surprised by the reaction we got. School kids today are used to their tablets and their mobile phones, so we thought we were going to have to put into a shiny box. But one of the biggest reactions from the children was because they could actually see it and point to it and tell what the different bits do. Normally you don't get to see the green stuff and they really love that, there's been such a positive response.","The Raspberry Pi is a credit-card sized computer that costs little more than a textbook .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Eman al-Obeidy, the woman who alleges rape and abuse by Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's security forces, said Thursday she feels defeated and lives in fear that she will be punished gravely for her words. The legal proceedings in her rape case have not gone far, she told CNN. She has not been able to go home, either. ""I usually get harassed when I have to show my Identification card to government officials somewhere and they find out who I am and that I have put complaints forward against Gadhafi's people,"" she said in an interview conducted in a car. ""They humiliate me to the point where other people gather around and start saying that it is shameful to treat a Libyan woman that way,"" she said. ""It is the same thing every day."" She said her only request now is permission to go home to Tobruk, to see her parents. ""I am very tired and upset and feel defeated, oppressed, and upset,"" she said. ""Even I felt sometimes of committing suicide from the injustice I am going through."" Al-Obeidy burst into the Rixos Hotel in Tripoli on March 26 while international journalists staying there were having breakfast. She told reporters she had been taken from a checkpoint east of Tripoli and held against her will for two days while being beaten and raped by 15 men. When CNN saw her earlier this month, al-Obeidy's legs and face were bruised and she had blood on her right inner thigh. Her visible injuries appeared to support her allegations. Human Rights Watch has called for Libyan authorities to immediately allow al-Obeidy to leave Tripoli and receive medical care. Nadya Khalife, a women's rights researcher for the organization, said authorities have further victimized al-Obeidy by refusing to allow her to leave. ""It's very difficult for women in Libyan society to report that they have been raped because of the shame and fear they feel, and it has been even more difficult for al-Obeidy,"" Khalife said. ""But she has courageously ignored all these barriers to tell her story to the world.""","Eman al-Obeidy tells CNN she is harassed by authorities, fears retribution and feels defeated .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  --   Actor and political activist Ron Silver, who played a recurring role in TV's presidential drama ""The West Wing,"" and who also let his political views play out in real life, died Sunday after a two-year battle with esophageal cancer, according to a colleague. Ron Silver is seen in this 2006 photograph. He had a recurring role in TV's ""The West Wing."" Robin L. Bronk, executive director of The Creative Coalition, said Silver, a New York native, died in his sleep with his family around him. ""Nothing could hold Ron back, not even a debilitating illness. His contributions as an artist and activist will never be forgotten,"" said Bronk, who runs an organization founded in 1989 by Silver, actor Christopher Reeve and other prominent figures in the arts as a political advocacy organization for the entertainment industry. Silver's politics moved from working for the Democratic Party and its candidates for most of his life to becoming a supporter of many Republican candidates and causes, with the shift occurring after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. He was quoted as saying the terrorist attacks and the Democratic Party's policies regarding terrorism had persuaded him to become a political independent. He backed then-President George W. Bush for a second term in 2004, and he spoke at the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York. One of Silver's final television appearances was on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" last October, when he was part of panel discussing Sen. John McCain's campaign against then-candidate Barack Obama. Asked by King about rifts within the Republican Party as the election neared and the country's financial crisis worsened, Silver said, ""The Republican Party, if they are out of power for a while, needs to regroup and rethink who they are as a party. This deregulation, this whole Reagan Revolution, did not seem to work in this crisis.""

"A rich kid gets pulled over driving a yellow Lamborghini in Miami Beach by police and arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence while allegedly street racing. It happens, but when it happens to Justin Bieber, it's beyond a big deal. The teen idol is just the latest young star to run afoul of both the police and public relations folks. But is it to be expected when a teen has both fame and access to so much wealth? Tons of young stars with more money than years behind them have run into such troubles before. For many, standing on the precipice of adulthood or just over that line, has appeared to trigger a spate of issues . In recent years, Lindsay Lohan, Chris Brown and Amanda Bynes have dominated headlines with legal issues and rehab stints. ""These kids don't have their identities set and no one says 'no,'"" said Sherrie Campbell, a psychologist and author of the book, ""Loving Yourself: The Mastery of Being Your Own Person."" ""These kids get all this money and they stop feeling themselves so they act out and they act out until they get in trouble, almost in that they have to lose everything in order to experience what they have,"" she said. Bieber has had both. According to Forbes, as of June 2013 the 19-year-old had earnings of $58 million. Since being discovered on YouTube in 2008, the singer had enjoyed an almost squeaky clean image until last year. Then the dogs from bad publicity hell were unleashed. From being accused of public urination to rumors of a visit to a Brazilian brothel and the run-ins with police (authorities recently swarmed his mansion is Calabasas, California, as part of a vandalism investigation), Bieber spent most of 2013 in the news for alleged bad behavior. His musical mentor Usher Raymond, a former teen star himself, told MTV in December 2013 that his young protege was experiencing the pains of growing up in the spotlight. ""With success comes great responsibility. And being able to grow up in it and unfortunately be analyzed in front of the world for just growing up, I think they will be able to see the truth,"" Usher said. ""And they can make an assessment based off of what his reality looks like."" Lately, Bieber's reality is not looking so great. Meet Justin Bieber's inner circle . Former child star Danny Bonaduce said on his Seattle radio show on KZOK-FM Thursday that Bieber's recent arrest could be just what the embattled teen star needs right now. ""This is the best thing that could have happened to him,"" said Bonaduce, who in the past has struggled with addiction and legal troubles. ""Speaking from personal experience, this could save his life."" Some of his fellow celebrities have condemned his behavior while others have offered support. Psychologist Sherrie Campbell pointed out that ""fame is its own addiction"" and said celebs are often under the pressure of the public's expectations. ""I think sometimes these stars think they have to live up to their own image to the point that they almost becomes fans of their own image,"" she said. Bieber arrest: Celebs offer sympathy, but jokes, too . For some young celebs, that type of skid is almost a rite of passage at this point. Britney Spears went from pop princess to investigated mother when in 2006 she was videotaped driving with her then-infant son Sean in her lap. A deputy was sent to Spears' home to investigate, though no charges resulted from the incident. What followed was a year of outrageous behavior including the infamous hair shaving incident, and Spears' father being awarded conservatorship over her fortune. Since then, Spears has managed to turn her life around, bagged a gig as a judge on ""The X Factor"" for a season, as well as a new boyfriend, album and Las Vegas residency. Other celebs have not bounced back as well as Spears. See Britney Spears through the years . Lindsay Lohan recently announced she will be starring in and producing a new film, and there's a six-episode documentary series on the way. But her last film bombed and her career is nowhere near what it once was. Likewise, Chris Brown's reputation has never fully recovered from his 2009 arrest following the attack on then-girlfriend Rihanna just before the Grammys. In October 2013, Brown was arrested in Washington on suspicion of punching a man, and then he was kicked out of a rehab facility for ""acting violently."" Now Bieber finds himself a member of the club of Hollywood's young, rich and infamous whose mugshots join their paparazzi shots. His being accused of drag racing in a sports car comes just months after an outpouring of sorrow for ""Fast & Furious"" star Paul Walker, who died in a crash where speed was a factor. It remains to be seen what the singer's response will be to his latest troubles. In the past, he has been less than repentant, telling The Hollywood Reporter in November about those who criticize his behavior, ""I don't give a f***."" ""Not 'I don't give a f***' to just be reckless and do whatever, but 'I don't give a f*** what they say,"" Bieber reportedly said.","Bieber is one of several rich, young and famous in trouble .
Stars including Lindsay Lohan and Chris Brown have also faced similar problems .
Former child star Danny Bonaduce says arrest may be a good thing ."
"(Budget Travel) -- In recent years, this fishing town -- and next-wave surf spot -- has turned into a popular rest stop for Inca Trail hikers. Oceanfront lodging runs about $40 a night in Mancora, Peru. Bus ride: $37 . The quickest way to reach Máncora, about 700 miles north of Lima, is to hop on one of Lan Peru's twice daily flights from Lima to Piura ($225 round trip); from there, it's about a two-hour cab ride to Máncora ($70). If you have 18 hours to spare, take the Cruz del Sur bus (cruzdelsur.com.pe, $37). Tear your eyes from the dubbed American movies shown along the way and you may spot a dolphin or two frolicking in the Pacific Ocean. Beach hotel: $40 . There are two types of lodging: on the beach -- like Punta Ballenas Inn ( 011-51/7325-8136) -- and almost on the beach. In the case of Hospedaje Costa Norte, you're a minute's walk from the surf. The rooms surround a courtyard guarded by Pedro, a parrot with a penchant for giving besitos (little kisses) to female guests (011-51/7325-8198, from $10). Yoga hotel: $70 . Samana Chakra is a new thatched-roof bungalow resort on the northern end of the beach, owned by an ex-marketing director from California and his wife, a Peruvian yoga instructor. The rate includes breakfast and a daily hatha yoga class (totally optional, of course). Early risers can even surf with the owners, who ride tandem on a longboard (011-51/1-9830-5896, samanachakra.com). Taxi fare: 95¢ . Moto-taxis, three-wheeled motorbikes with a covered backseat for two, are Máncora's primary form of transportation. The bumpy ride across town costs about a dollar. For $14 round trip, a moto cabbie will take you into the Amotape Mountains to the thermal hot springs at Poza de Barro. Surf school: $16 . Máncora's six-foot waves rival those of better-known surf spots in Peru, such as Chicama, but early mornings often bring waves that are ideal for beginners. Several shorefront surf schools offer 90-minute private lessons. Tasty lunch: $6 . Fried yucca and ice-cold Brahma beer are the perfect companions to ceviche, the national dish of Peru, made with seafood, maize, crescents of sweet potato, and a citrus marinade. At Cevichería Las Peñitas, an entire meal, including ceviche and beer, costs less than $6. Fruit drink: 50¢ . The best deal in town is a cremolada (a crushed-ice beverage made with passion fruit, strawberry, orange, or pineapple) at Papa Mo's Milk Bar. Passion fruit is said to have a mildly sedative effect -- not unlike a few days spent in Máncora. Necklace: $7 . On a three-block stretch of sidewalk near the southern end of town, dreadlocked nomads and local artisans sell everything from shark jaws to tins of natilla, Peru's version of dulce de leche. The most unusual wares are adorned with deep orange huayruro seeds, which come from the Amazon rain forest and are believed to ward off negative energy. A double-strand necklace costs $7.

"Semi-ambidextrous Nicholas Cronquist rebelled against third-grade cursive lessons. ""I remember I hated it and I told my teacher I thought it was dumb,"" he says. Cronquist, now 26, eventually learned to like using his left hand to inscribe strings of words. But typing papers while at the University of North Dakota and choosing a career rooted in technology drastically decreased the amount he wrote by hand, causing writing in cursive to become uncomfortable and painful. So he switched to printing right-handed while still signing his name with the left. ""I don't even think I know how to write in cursive anymore,"" says Cronquist, who now lives and works in Laos. Technology is constantly increasing communication speeds, often anticipating words before our brains can send signals to our fingers. But experts say handwriting is being sacrificed for the sake of technology's convenience. People like Cronquist say they communicate so much via laptops, phones and tablets that they rarely need to scribble a handwritten note. This trend is reinforced by a 2012 study that found 33% of people had difficulty reading their own handwriting. Docmail, a UK-based printing and mailing company, conducted the study and concluded that one in three participants had not been required to produce something in handwriting for more than half a year. It also found that updating calendars, phone books and reminder notes was more likely to be completed without using a pen. Finally, more than half of participants said their handwriting was noticeably declining. The state of handwriting in the United States, which celebrates National Handwriting Day every January 23 -- John Hancock's birthday -- is not much better, says Wendy Carlson, a handwriting expert and forensic document examiner. Carlson works as an expert court witness, maintaining offices in Denver and Dallas. She says the dramatic decline of handwriting is causing ""great"" deterioration of the mind. ""Texting played a role in it because people are trying to write quick short sentences,"" she says. ""People aren't using their minds and they are relying on technology to make the decisions for them."" Carlson says cursive writing combines mental and physical processes which involve both sides of the brain. She says she's noticed that the number of people who write cursive decreases as technology becomes the most dominant means of communication. ""If you are typing or texting, it's a matter of punching and finger-moving,"" she says. ""You are doing very little thinking because you are not allowing your brain to form neural processes."" Jan Olsen is the founder and president of Handwriting Without Tears, a company that creates handwriting curriculum guides and workbooks for teachers and students from kindergarten through fifth grade. She says handwriting, especially cursive, is viewed as old-fashioned by some. Lernstift smartpen checks your spelling as you write . ""The only reason to write anything is to retrieve it later,"" she said. ""So you need to have it legible."" Cursive requirements in U.S. public schools have declined as access to technology increases. Alabama, California, Georgia, Idaho,  Massachusetts and North Carolina require cursive and several other states are considering it. The Washington Post reported in April that 45 states have adopted common core standards for education. Such standards are designed to provoke thought while at the same time preparing students to pass standardized tests, but they do not include a cursive learning requirement. In other words, many kids today are growing up without having to learn the looping, elegant script that was demanded of their parents and grandparents. Going forward, it will be up to individual states to decide whether to require cursive and then up to school districts to make it a focal part of the curriculum. Burdened by budget cuts, it is likely many states and districts will choose to have students type instead of write. Olsen, 72, says the writing styles used in technology and handwriting conflict. Texts and instant messages require use of communication English, while writing requires use of standard English, she says. ""To achieve in the world, people need to use standard (English)."" But the irony is that Olsen, who communicates via text message on her iPhone, says Handwriting Without Tears must be tech-savvy to remain competitive. In addition to its workbooks, the company offers an electronic teaching guide and an app. ""At work we have technology up the kazoo,"" she says. Nation of adults who will write like children? Francis Smith, a bank officer living in Gibraltar, says that while technology allows instantaneous communication, he is nostalgic about handwriting due to its permanence and tangibility. ""If there is no electricity, none of (technology) will work,"" he says. ""Notebooks have served us for a couple thousand years."" Smith, a former civil servant, used to write for work, but has spent the last 23 years typing on a PC. He says it has negatively impacted his handwriting to the point that people would never guess he won a handwriting contest when he was a child. ""It's a shame that now when you write quickly it looks like it's by someone who has not had an education,"" he says. Smith, 52, says he's started using a fountain pen to try to improve his penmanship. ""It's got a lovely feel to it,"" he says. ""It's not very practical."" Smith says he wants to recapture his ability to write cursive. Cronquist, however, is happy that printing allows him to write legibly. ""My right-handed printing is not too terrible,"" he says. ""It's slow, but readable."" Spot-on handwriting analysis surprises .","One-third of participants in a study had trouble reading their own handwriting .

"His full name is Idris Ayodeji Bello, but you might just call him ""Afropreneur."" That's the buzzword adopted by the young Nigerian to describe the bright, independent and tech savvy entrepreneurs using creative thinking and the power of innovation to take over Africa's economic destiny. ""Over time Africa has relied on government and big multinationals for solutions -- but they're not coming,"" explains Bello. ""But of recent you're seeing a new wave of young men and women who have access to all the global networks, who've studied either within the continent or outside and have this passion for change -- these are the people Africa's change is going to come from, these are the people I call 'Afropreneurs.'"" And Bello is certainly leading by example. At just 33 years old,  he has already been involved in several tech initiatives aimed at encouraging entrepreneurship and empowering communities across Africa. Connecting solutions to problems . Early last year, Bello co-founded the Wennovation Hub in Nigeria, a technology space enabling ambitious entrepreneurs to come together and develop their trailblazing ideas into successful businesses. The Lagos-based hub, one of the many innovation centers that have recently mushroomed across Africa, has so far incubated the efforts of more than 100 entrepreneurs, providing them with space, support and consulting. ""Part of our own responsibility is to connect the talent to the opportunity,"" says Bello. ""We took the ""i"" out of innovation and replaced it with the ""we"" and came up with the Wennovation Hub -- the problems of Africa are huge, they cannot be solved by one person alone, so it requires people coming together."" Access is key . Born in Nigeria to a family of academics, Bello says he learned from an early age the importance of access to information. Growing up, he says, he was surrounded by books. ""We had a mantra in our house,"" remembers Bello. ""My dad would always say 'never get caught without a book,' so whether you had lunch or you were sleeping, you always had to have your book."" Read related: Africa's 'father of technology' Bello went on to study computer science  in Nigeria before moving to the United States and the UK to further his academic knowledge in entrepreneurship and global health. Along the way, his entrepreneurial spirit kicked in -- he worked for multinationals such as Procter & Gamble and Chevron and also got involved in a number of startups. But Africa was always bound to be central to Bello's work. Passionate about his continent, he quickly ventured into what he describes as ""the business of technology in health and education."" 'An app a day keeps the doctor away' As a result, Bello co-founded AfyaZima, a health technology and management startup that leverages the rise of mobile phones and other low-cost technologies across Africa to provide access to vital health information. The startup won the 2012 Dell Technology Award -- in collaboration with the Oxford Engineering World Health Group -- for Blood Pressure MCuff, a low-cost device that enables blood pressure monitoring and data transmission via mobile phones. The technology hence acts as a communication channel for doctors to remotely send treatment recommendations to their patients. The concept is this: at the moment you put mobile phone on everybody's hands, how can it comes to that ... instead of people going to the hospital, the hospital comes to you,""Bello says.  ""Growing up, they used to tell us an apple a day keeps the doctor away, now it's more like an app a day keeps the doctor away."" AfyaZima, which comes from a Swahili word for complete health, is also working to create a cloud-based service that will receive the mobile phone data and store them in an electronic health record. 'Bringing online education to an offline world' But perhaps Bello's most daring project to date is YoKwazi: an ambitious initiative aiming to change Africa's education landscape by putting learning resources to the hands of students and teachers across the continent. Bello explains that due to broadband constraints many young Africans are losing out in the major shift toward open education in parts of the developed world, where massive open online courses are offered for free. ""That's where I step in,"" he says. ""I come from the developing world but I have had access to this good education and so my goal is to bridge that gap -- to knock down that barrier of broadband."" Read also: Web savvy Africans fuel growth in online shopping . Still at testing stage, YoKwazi aims to deploy OTGPlaya, an offline wireless cloud device, in key community areas to house and host online educational tools. The device, which was incubated at the Wennovation Hub, will do a one-time download, store the content and make it available for people nearby to access it through their wi-fi enabled devices. ""It's about bringing online education to an offline world,"" says Bello. Legacy of 'Afropreneurs' Multifarious and passionate, Bello says his mission as an ""Afropreneur"" is to enable access to information so that people can tap into their own creativity to solve their problems without having to rely on government. ""A lot of times we're focused too much on trying to solve people's problems. But people are the ones who best know their own problems but often can lack the tools they need,"" he says. ""When you give people access to health education, they will take better care of their health; when you give people access to education, you will see people even do greater things,"" adds Bello. ""We enable people to access -- when they know, they will solve their problems. That my proposition.""","Nigerian Idris Ayodeji Bello describes himself as an ""Afropreneur""

"Women coaches in men's sport are suddenly all the rage. Fresh from Helena Costa becoming France's first ever professional female football coach for a male team, reigning Wimbledon champion Andy Murray has announced double grand slam winner Amelie Mauresmo as his new coach. The world no. 5 has been searching for a new coach since splitting with Czech great Ivan Lendl in March and the Scot announced the new appointment following a French Open semifinal defeat to Rafael Nadal. It is only the second time a player inside the top 10 of the men's rankings has appointed a female coach, with Mauresmo following in the footsteps of Tatiana Naumko -- who worked with Russian former world no. 9 Andrei Chesnokov. ""I spoke to Amelie a couple of times on the phone, I met her in Paris in person,"" the Briton told CNN at Queen's Club, where he will defend his title at the Wimbledon warm-up event this week. ""I just had a good feeling about it. She was extremely calm, spoke very well, listened very well. I think communication is really important in individual sport and I'm looking forward to it."" Mauresmo isn't the first woman to potentially have a significant influence on his career. Murray's mother Judy, who is captain of the British women's Fed Cup team, played a major role in her son's rise to the top and was in his team for a number of years. ""I'm really excited to be able to work with Andy,"" Mauresmo said from Roland Garros, where she was working as a commentator for Eurosport. ""He's an amazingly talented tennis player and I feel I have plenty to offer both him and the team around him."" Murray and Mauresmo have initially agreed to a short-term arrangement, with the latter, like Judy, committed to the French Fed Cup team. The duo have just two weeks to prepare for Murray's title defense at the All England Club at Wimbledon. After hiring eight-time grand slam winner Lendl in December 2011, Murray's career really took off. He won Olympic gold at London 2012 before clinching his first major at the U.S. Open later that year. In 2013 the Scot ended a 77-year wait for a British champion at the grass-court grand slam with a straight sets defeat of Novak Djokovic. Since that historic win, Murray has struggled with a back injury and he underwent surgery to correct the problem last September. Murray has been playing his way back into form and fitness and reached the last four at Roland Garros, before a resounding defeat to eventual champion Nadal. The 27-year-old will be hoping Mauresmo can help him return to grand slam-winning ways.","Andy Murray hires Amelie Mauresmo as his new coach .

"Melissa Nelson lost her bid Friday to have Iowa's top court reverse its ruling that held the former dental assistant did not suffer gender bias when she was fired for being ""irresistible."" The Iowa Supreme Court stood by its December finding that Dr. James Knight was legally able to fire the assistant after his wife became concerned about the relationship between the two. Knight's conduct was not sex discrimination in violation of the Iowa Civil Rights Act, the court said. The all-male court had previously ruled against Nelson, finding that employees who are seen as an ""irresistible attraction"" by their employers can be fired in such circumstances. Read the court's ruling (PDF) Nelson worked for James Knight in 1999 and stayed for more than 10 years at the Fort Dodge business. Toward the end of her employment, Knight complained to Nelson her clothing was tight and ""distracting,"" the court said in its first ruling. Nelson denied her clothes were inappropriate. At one point, Knight told Nelson that ""if she saw his pants bulging, she would know her clothing was too revealing."" At another point, in response to an alleged comment Nelson made about the infrequency of her sex life, Knight responded: [T]hat's like having a Lamborghini in the garage and never driving it."" Knight would occasionally ask Nelson to wear a lab coat, the court said in its Friday ruling. During the last six months of Nelson's employment, Nelson and Knight, both married with children, started sending text messages to each other outside of work. Neither objected to the texting. Knight's wife, who was employed at the same dental office, found out about those messages in late 2009 and demanded he fire Nelson. In early 2010, he did just that. In the presence of a pastor, Knight told Nelson she had become a ""detriment"" to his family and that for the sakes of both their families, they should no longer work together, the court said. Knight gave Nelson one month's severance. Justice Edward Mansfield wrote Friday that the court, in reconsidering the case, found that the firing of Nelson ""did not amount to unlawful discrimination."" He said that Nelson's arguments warranted serious consideration, but the court found a distinction between an employment decision based on personal relations and one based on gender itself. ""In the former case, the decision is driven entirely by individual feelings and emotions regarding a specific person,"" said Mansfield. ""Such a decision is not gender-based, nor is it based on factors that might be a proxy for gender."" ""While the loss of a job is often devastating to an employee, and at times unfair, these considerations do not play a role under our employment-at-will doctrine, and our exceptions to this law, such as sex discrimination, are only based on the underlying discriminatory motivation of the decision maker,"" said Mansfield. Knight told Nelson she was his best assistant, according to the court. The dentist then hired another female assistant. Nelson did not contend her employer committed sexual harassment. Paige Fiedler, Nelson's attorney, criticized Friday's ruling. ""Up until now, courts were the only thing standing in the way of employers like Knight getting away with violating the civil rights of their employees,"" Fiedler said in a statement. ""Now men can protect themselves from sexual harassment claims simply by firing women they've been harassing."" After the court's initial ruling in December, Knight's attorney said a ruling against his client would ""ignore every other case we could find"" with similar facts. ""He and his wife really agonized about it,"" Stuart Cochrane said about Knight's decision to fire Nelson. ""He didn't want to terminate her."" Chief Justice Mark Cady, in a concurring opinion Friday, said Knight and Nelson developed a consensual personal relationship. ""It is undisputed that this relationship extended well beyond the workplace. Nelson and Dr. Knight communicated with each other outside the workplace on matters extraneous to the employment. Their relationship was personal and closer than the relationships Dr. Knight maintained with the other employees,"" Cady argued.

"U.S. officials say they have specific reasons to worry about security in Sochi, only three days before the Winter Olympic Games are set to open in the Russian city. Speaking at a House Intelligence Committee hearing on Tuesday, Matthew Olsen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center, highlighted concern over the Games and whether Muslim fundamentalists in disputed regions of Russia -- or other groups -- could launch deadly attacks on selected targets. ""There are a number of specific threats of varying degrees of credibility that we're tracking,"" he said. ""And we're working very closely with the Russians and with other partners to monitor any threats we see and to disrupt those."" Russian security forces have cracked down on suspected militants in the restive North Caucasus republic of Dagestan and elsewhere in recent weeks after twin suicide bombings in the city of Volgograd in December. ""The primary threat, from a terrorism perspective, comes from Imarat Kavkaz, probably the most prominent terrorist group in Russia. It's made its intent clear to seek to carry out attacks in the run-up to the Games,"" said Olsen. ""We think the greater danger from a terrorist perspective is in potential for attacks to occur outside of the actual venues for the Games themselves in the area surrounding Sochi or outside of Sochi in the region."" His comments were echoed by U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, who spoke to CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" Tuesday night. ""I think the venues themselves will be OK. The Russians have done a lot of guards, gates and guns to try to secure the venues and try to get a ring around the Games. I'm very concerned by the sheer level of attention and effort, not just from Chechens and folks in that region, but outside of that region that have expressed an interest in actually having a violent act occur at the Games."" He complained about cooperation issues. ""They're not at 100%. They really should be when it comes to peoples' lives at the Games, and we know that it's such a high-threat environment,"" said Rogers, R-Michigan. President Barack Obama was briefed Tuesday on U.S. efforts to support security in Sochi. ""He was assured by his team that they are taking all appropriate steps regarding the safety of Americans.  He directed them to continue to work closely with the Russian government and other partners toward a secure and successful Sochi Games, and to review carefully and act on any new information that might affect the security of the Games,"" according to a White House statement. Austrians threatened . Americans aren't the only ones worried about security. Concerns that have cast a shadow in the lead-up to the Games were heightened when two Austrian competitors received a threat. Wolfgang Eischer, spokesman for the Austrian Olympic Committee, told CNN the body received a letter, written in German, threatening two female members of the Winter Olympic team. He would not confirm whether the letter was posted in Russia. ""This anonymous letter contains a concrete (piece of) information about two persons being in danger with regard to Sochi, and further details are not public,"" Interior Ministry spokesman Karl-Heinz Grundboeck said. It was not known who made the threats, although Islamist militants have warned of attacks to undermine Russian President Vladimir Putin's hopes of using the Games to show Russia is a safe, modern state. Putin arrived in Sochi Tuesday on a ""working visit,"" according to state news agency RIA Novosti. A leopard rehabilitation center was the first stop on Putin's schedule. The animals at the center, which opened nearly four years ago, are under the President's personal protection, state media said. One of them is a 6-month old leopard kitten called Thunder. Costs in spotlight . Putin also attended several events held by the International Olympic Committee on Tuesday, including the opening of the 126th IOC session, where he met IOC President Thomas Bach. Putin called the Games a grand project, ""not just in terms of the external image of the city of making it more beautiful, more comfortable, but also in terms of the assistance, the social and economic, cultural and ecological aspects."" Bach on Monday addressed criticism of the cost of the Games, saying that huge sums spent on improving infrastructure should not be wrapped into the total cost, according to RIA Novosti. The costs of the Sochi Games ""do not exceed previous Olympics,"" he said. ""To transform a little bit old-fashioned summer resort into a modern, year-round sport and tourist destination -- you can see this transformation -- these are not Olympic costs. This is the transformation of a whole region, and the Games serve as a catalyst for this kind of development."" Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak last year put the total cost at $51 billion, which would make the Sochi Games the most expensive ever held. But Russian officials now put the cost of the Games at $6.4 billion, saying the money spent on improving transport links, power supplies and sewerage should not be included in the sum. Unfinished hotel rooms . Concerns have been raised that some of the hotels built for the event aren't ready to welcome journalists and athletes as planned. But Bach said only 3% of hotel rooms are unfinished, RIA Novosti reported. Citing the Russian organizers, the IOC chief said that the people affected would be offered alternative accommodation and that outstanding issues would be resolved in time for the Games. In the seven years since Russia won its bid to host the 2014 event, authorities have built a highway, a high-speed train line, electric power stations and an entire series of resort villages in the Caucasus Mountains, where the alpine sport events will take place. It has also built tens of thousands of new hotel rooms. OPINION: Vladimir Putin's remarkable comeback .","Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee complains about cooperation .

"(CNN) -- It's been said time and again that you can't teach an old dog new tricks, but what about giving one a new lease on life? Animal rights organizations like the ASPCA and shelters nationwide have taken to observing November as Adopt-A-Senior-Pet Month. To mark that occasion, some of the top senior pooches on social media are taking the cause into their own hands ... er, paws. Marnie, a 12-year-old Shih Tzu, is one of them. Within the past year, Marnie has grown into an Internet superstar, with more than 500,000 Instagram followers and considerable audiences on both Twitter and Tumblr. But before she was Marnie, rubbing elbows in the bright lights of New York City with celebrities like James Franco and Tina Fey, she was ""Stinky,"" a smelly, matted dog found roaming the streets of a small Connecticut town. The same year that Stinky found herself in a shelter, Manhattanite Shirley Braha had turned 30 and admittedly felt a little lonely. She always knew she wanted a dog, despite growing up in a family without one, and wanted to adopt rather than buy, so she turned to the adoption site PetFinder.com. ""I never owned a dog before and I didn't know what the heck I was doing,"" Braha says. She also knew a puppy might be too overwhelming, so she narrowed it down to browsing for dogs in their golden years. In her search, she stumbled across a tiny picture of a dog who leaned slightly to the left with its tongue lolling out. Something tugged at Braha about ol' Stinky, she told CNN. She made the trek from Manhattan, took Stinky home and renamed her after one of her favorite singers, Marnie Stern. But Braha says those first days of dog ownership were not quite as seamless as she might have expected. Marnie had intestinal parasites, and a grayed out eye, which the vet said she would never see out of again. Her tilted head was the result of a bout of vestibular syndrome, which can affect a dog's equilibrium. ""When I first got her, I didn't know if this dog was going to live more than a couple of weeks,"" Braha says. ""I kind of recalibrated my expectations that this dog could possibly be dying and it's my job to comfort it in its last days."" But Marnie pulled through and now lives a rather extraordinary life in her forever home (she can see out of both eyes and her head tilt is a beloved signature, to boot). Braha says she initially created an Instagram account just for Marnie so she didn't bombard her friends with too many dog pictures. She never imagined people outside her social circle would embrace Marnie the way they have. ""I think she's cute, but I just hoped people wouldn't think my dog is gross,"" Braha joked with CNN. ""Now, sometimes people start shaking as if they're meeting an actual celebrity."" And celebrities now even reach out to her for an encounter. Braha says making an environment where Marnie feels safe and comfortable has helped the pooch's personality shine -- so much so that Braha has since quit her job in TV production and manages Marnie's social media full-time. ""I love having her with me, but I do it for her,"" she says. ""She HATES being alone. She enjoys seeing the world, living life, seeing new places and meeting new people."" A chance picture turned into a second chance . Susie is another lucky senior dog whose owner has harnessed the power of the Internet. Erin O'Sullivan owns the 15-year-old chihuahua mix, along with her boyfriend Brandon Stanton. Susie came into their care when Stanton, who runs the wildly successful blog-turned-book Humans of New York, took a picture of Susie sitting on a stoop in his neighborhood. A few days later, the owner saw Stanton in the street and asked him if he would like to adopt her due to the owner's financial hardship and a new marriage. Stanton couldn't turn down the tiny stoop-sitting dog with a mohawk. As with any pet owner, they started posting pictures online but soon decided there could be something bigger here. O'Sullivan has since started the site Susie's Senior Dogs, where she posts photos of older dogs from around the country who desperately need to be adopted. Since March 2014, roughly 200 dogs have been adopted via Susie's Senior Dogs -- and that's not counting the numerous emails from viewers who said they adopted a senior dog in their nearby shelter because of the initiative. O'Sullivan says that there is a misconception about senior canines, that something is wrong with them or they're on their deathbed. Time with a senior dog may be limited, but sharing life with any dog is precious, she says.

"(CNN) -- I've returned to Washington after a long time away in my home in Britain to get a sense of the political mood in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. And I'm pretty depressed to discover that everyone is talking about Jeb Bush. It's not that he wouldn't make a strong candidate for the GOP. It's that the thought of a third Bush in the White House feels distinctly un-American. Like you're all giving up on the whole ""revolution"" thing in favor of English-style aristocracy. Speculation was reignited -- one suspects entirely by accident -- when George P. Bush told ABC that his father is ""giving [the presidency] serious thought and moving ... forward."" I've heard the opposite, that the candidate hasn't quite got the requisite enthusiasm. He also has plenty of weaknesses hidden by the fact that he hasn't declared yet (voters are always far keener on people who aren't officially running than those who are). As Chris Cillizza wrote in The Washington Post, the former Florida governor's polling is unspectacular, he disagrees with the GOP base on some important issues and his patrician tone is better-suited to a general election than to a primary campaign. Having said that, Jeb would still be a more than worthy addition to the race that right now is full of newbies to national politics (Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, etc.). He has gravitas, executive experience in a major state and a record of winning votes among the groups to which Republicans know they need to reach out. Bush speaks Spanish, his wife was born in Mexico and he took an astonishing 61% of the Hispanic vote in the 1998 governor's race. There's a case for putting Jeb on the ticket just to win Florida back: its growing, non-Cuban, Hispanic population helped give it to Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. But there is one big argument against a Bush candidacy: his name. I hate to sound so superficial, but I sense that it does matter for a whole host of complex psychological reasons. It brings back memories of his brother, George W., who polls suggest is blamed by a significant number of people for America's problems. If the race is Bush vs. Clinton in 2016, then it's a clash of nostalgias -- and Americans' feelings about the Clinton years are probably a lot warmer than they are about the Bush ones. It's job security vs. credit crunch and relative peace vs. endless war. The irony is that Jeb is probably politically a little more polished than either his brother or even father (he doesn't suffer from the strange verbal tics of George W. and George H.W. -- recall that the family patriarch once told people that he'd had ""some sex"" with Ronald Reagan). But by sheer coincidence of running for office after them, he will be associated with their myriad weaknesses. Moreover, family matriarch Barbara Bush was quite correct when she said that there was something innately unsettling about the thought of yet another Bush running for the presidency. Last year, she told Matt Lauer that although Jeb was the best candidate available (that's a proud mom speaking): ""I think it's a great country, there are a lot of great families, and it's not just four families whatever. There are other people out there that are very qualified, and we've had enough Bushes."" The same could be said about the Clintons, but you probably won't find a Clinton modest enough to say it. Barbara has stopped saying it, according to The New York Times, because the family has asked her to quit. America is supposed to be a democracy and, as such, its citizens should not tolerate aristocratic oligarchs lightly. If Jeb Bush ran and won, there would have been no decade without a Bush in the White House since the 1970s. And no Republican ticket would have won without a Bush or a Nixon on it since 1928. It's perfectly possible that the Bush family is uniquely talented. But it's more likely that a dearth of political talent in the United States has allowed them to concentrate far too much power in their hands. That they might go up against the Clintons in 2016 makes journalists salivate at the prospect of a ""grudge match."" But is it really healthy for American democracy forever to be looking backward? Especially at a moment in time when politics is defined by gridlock, I sense that Washington, and the rest of the country, is exhausted by old battles over policy. What's needed is a fresh new start. That might translate into a vote for youth (Marco Rubio), for a new philosophical direction (Elizabeth Warren or Rand Paul) or for the elevation of a ""common man"" who gets the middle-class (Chris Christie). What I doubt it'll mean is the keys of the White House returning to the Bush family. For all their undoubted service to the presidency, they don't own it.","Tim Stanley: It's depressing to hear people talking about Jeb Bush and a possible 2016 run .

"(CNN)A stuffy, overcrowded cell. Perhaps two or three men to a single bunk. Lockdown for most of the day. Is this what awaits South Africa's Oscar Pistorius when he's sentenced for culpable homicide in the death of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp? Legal experts say it's impossible to predict what sentence Judge Thokozile Masipa may hand down. But many will be watching to see if the Olympian's dramatic fall from grace ends with time behind bars. If that's indeed the case, the chances are that life would not be easy for South Africa's most famous disabled athlete. A double amputee, he needs prosthetic limbs to get around. And rights campaigners warn that South African prisons -- which they say are notorious for overcrowding, gang violence and unsanitary conditions -- are often a difficult environment even for the fittest of inmates. Nooshin Erfani-Ghadimi, project coordinator for the Johannesburg-based Wits Justice Project, a civil society group, believes Pistorius would likely receive far better treatment than the average prisoner -- as he has throughout the judicial process, she says. That means he might get a cell to himself. Even so, she told CNN, ""I don't think anyone with a disability necessarily will be able to be provided for at the moment in a way that ensures that they would have the correct medical treatment, that they have the correct physical structures."" Some of South Africa's prisons are better than others, of course. But whichever one might house Pistorius, there's no question that conditions would be a far cry from those in the $560,000 home in the luxury Silverwoods Estate, on the outskirts of Pretoria, where he shot Steenkamp dead last year. Pretoria Central . South Africa's department of correctional services has policies in place for dealing with physically disabled inmates, Erfani-Ghadimi said. ""Policy and practice, however, are often poles apart. Unfortunately, prisoners with disabilities face the same inhumane conditions as other able-bodied inmates."" Correctional Services Department spokesman Koos Gerber previously told CNN that South Africa's detention facilities, whether for remand prisoners or those serving prison terms, ""can accommodate people with any disabilities."" There's been speculation that Pistorius could be sent to Pretoria Central Prison, although no one really knows. It's not easy for rights researchers to get access inside, Erfani-Ghadimi said. But the prison does not have the best reputation. The Pretoria News reported last year on a case brought by six inmates who told Pretoria High Court of having to share a single cell with others, with no ventilation, dirty mattresses and no bedding. They were locked up for 18 hours a day, the court heard, and threatened with sexual violence by gangs. Steenkamp's mother stunned by verdict, wants to meet Pistorius . Medical care 'overstretched' On average, Erfani-Ghadimi said, South African prisons are overcrowded, putting a strain on sanitation, ventilation and medical care. The overcrowding means three men may share a single cell, or communal cells for 40 people are jammed with double the number they were intended to hold, with men sleeping in double or triple bunks, according to the Wits Justice Project. One of the biggest risks associated with that is contracting tuberculosis, labeled the biggest killer in South Africa's prisons in a recent report, Erfani-Ghadimi said. The disease spreads easily in packed, steamy cells with little air. In some prisons, overstretched nurses can never see all the people needing help on any day. Inconsistent treatment regimens mean drug-resistant TB strains develop and spread, while disruptions to antiretroviral programs also impact detainees who are HIV-positive. ""Also in terms of health management we've seen stories of people who are diabetic and have gone into insulin shock because they've been arrested and haven't been able to get to their medication,"" Erfani-Ghadimi said. Speaking earlier this year, Correctional Services Minister Sibusiso Ndebele said that ""overcrowding at correctional facilities is a global challenge,"" and that South Africa's prison population had dropped over the past decade. As of April this year, there were about 157,400 inmates, of whom nearly 28% were on remand -- a term used for pretrial custody, according to official figures. The country's total population is about 54 million. Who is the judge that'll be sentencing him? Double-edged sword . There's no doubt that Pistorius' case has put South Africa's justice system under the international spotlight. While the scrutiny may have been uncomfortable at time for South African authorities, it appears to have worked in the track star's favor until now. When he was first detained after Steenkamp's killing, the African National Congress Women's League complained that he got special treatment, both in where he was held and in access to his family. Some impoverished suspects who can't afford a lawyer or bail spend months or even years waiting for their cases just to come to court. But Pistorius was released on bail with relaxed conditions, and his trial began little more than a year after Steenkamp's death on February 14, 2013. Erfani-Ghadimi describes his progress through the legal system as ""an anomaly"" in terms of both speed and the expert resources dedicated to it. ""Other cases normally take much longer, and both the victims and the accused face the strong probability of a miscarriage of justice,"" she wrote in a piece published on The Conversation website. However, when it comes to serving time in prison, the athlete's fame -- and the extra attention that goes with it -- could be a double-edged sword when it comes to getting special privileges, she told CNN. ""A lot of people are able to subvert (the system) and pay bribes and get away with things, but he hasn't been able to,"" she said. ""But on the other hand he has been able to get advantages that other people haven't."" 'Living here is very hard' Some of these differences may be stark. The Wits Justice Project has highlighted the case of paraplegic inmate Ronnie Fakude, held on remand for 28 months before being freed on bail earlier this year with an electronic tag, in a pilot monitoring project. Before his release, he described his experience to Carolyn Raphaely, a senior journalist with the project. ""I'm a 50-year-old paraplegic and have been awaiting trial for more than two years since my arrest on fraud charges in December 2011. I can't walk, I can't control my bowel or bladder and have to wear disposable baby nappies which my family buy for me. I'm paralysed from level four and don't have a wheelchair,"" he said, according to the project. ""If I use my [crutches] I have to pull my legs and throw them to the front. That's how I walk. Living here is very hard. We are 88 men in this cell which is meant for 32. Sometimes there are more. Twelve people sleep in two bunks pushed together, that's six on the top and six on the bottom. I have my own bed on the bottom, which is a privilege. Luckily, I don't have to share because of my medical status. ""There are eight or 10 people with TB in this cell and four or five we know are HIV-positive. A guy with multi-drug resistant TB sleeps on top of me. I feel vulnerable all the time."" Erfani-Ghadimi argues that as a severely disabled man, Fakude should never have been in detention at all. And if she had her way, the same would be true for Pistorius.

"ANKARA, Turkey (CNN) -- President Obama ended his first overseas trip in Turkey -- a location he said he chose to send a clear message. President Obama and Turkish President Abdullah Gul hold a joint news conference Monday. ""I'm trying to make a statement about the importance of Turkey, not just to the United States but to the world,"" Obama said at a joint news conference Monday with Turkish President Abdullah Gul. ""This is a country that has been often said lies at the crossroads between East and West. It's a country that possesses an extraordinarily rich heritage but also represents a blend of those ancient traditions with a modern nation state that respects democracy, respects rule of law and is striving toward a modern economy."" Obama said Monday that the United States and Turkey can send a powerful message to the world through their friendship. ""I think that where there's the most promise of building stronger U.S.-Turkish relations is in the recognition that Turkey and the United States can build a model partnership in which a predominantly Christian nation, a predominantly Muslim nation -- a Western nation and a nation that straddles two continents,"" he continued, ""that we can create a modern international community that is respectful, that is secure, that is prosperous, that there are not tensions -- inevitable tensions between cultures -- which I think is extraordinarily important.""  Watch Obama on the importance of the U.S.-Turkish relationship » . U.S. approval ratings among Turks hit dismal lows throughout the Bush administration, largely because of the war in neighboring Iraq, which was widely unpopular in Turkey. The Turks seem to be captivated, however, by the new American president, according to one influential newspaper. On Monday, the Hurriyet published a front-page headline saying, ""Welcome Mr. President. ... Our hearts have been broken over the last eight years, now it is time to mend hearts."" Middle East analyst Reza Aslan said Monday that following years of frosty relations, Obama wants to strengthen ties with Turkey to send a signal to other Muslim nations. ""Turkey is the most important majority-Muslim state when it comes to the United States' interest in the region,"" he said. ""He wants to make the U.S.-Turkey relations the bedrock for the way in which he's going to reach out to the rest of the Muslim world,"" Aslan added. Obama said Monday that ""one of the great strengths of the United States"" is that it does not consider itself ""a Christian nation or a Jewish nation or a Muslim nation. We consider ourselves a nation of citizens who are bound by ideals and a set of values. I think modern Turkey was founded with a similar set of principles."" In an address before the Turkish Parliament later Monday, Obama acknowledged that ""the trust that binds the United States and Turkey has been strained, and I know that strain is shared in many places where the Muslim faith is practiced."" Obama said, ""So let me say this as clearly as I can: The United States is not and will never be at war with Islam.""  Watch what Obama says about Islam » . On his first presidential visit to a Muslim country, Obama highlighted that he too had Muslims in his family and had lived in a Muslim-majority country. Obama also called on Turkey, NATO's only Muslim member country, to work side by side with the United States to resolve conflicts across the turbulent Middle East. The president reiterated American support for Turkey's bid to join the European Union, a position that was recently criticized by French President Nicolas Sarkozy. Former U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said Obama's visit to Turkey is an ""important step for the president."" ""Turkey is a very important country -- one of our critical members of NATO. They play an important role in helping to support troops in both Iraq and Afghanistan. They will hopefully play a role in helping to bring about a Middle East peace settlement,"" he said. Turkey sends ""a very important signal to the rest of the Muslim world that the United States is not anti-Muslim as so many have thought we have been, but rather here is a very strong Muslim nation that is working hand in hand with the United States,"" Cohen said. Obama on Monday avoided pushing for a pledge he made during his presidential campaign to recognize officially the massacre of ethnic Armenians in 1915 as a genocide. Turkey vehemently denies Armenian claims that 1 million Armenians were killed in the last days of the Ottoman Empire. Instead, the American president highlighted recent diplomatic progress made between the governments of Turkey and Armenia, saying he was ""not interested in the U.S. tilting this negotiation in any way."" Turkey and Armenia do not have formal diplomatic relations and their borders are closed. However, last fall the Turkish president went to a soccer match in Armenia, and Armenia's top diplomat was expected to attend a U.N.-sponsored ""Alliance of Civilizations"" forum Monday in Istanbul, Turkey. Obama hinted that a major diplomatic breakthrough between the two rivals may come soon. ""My sense is they are moving forward quickly,"" he said at an earlier press conference with Gul. ""I don't want to pre-empt any arrangements that could be made in the near future.""

"Dressed in yellow, he stands a foot off the deck of a Colorado Springs home, and a few feet from the woods. Everywhere in front of him, there's fire. Thankfully, the flames that climb about five feet up backyard trees don't catch on -- partly because a homeowner wisely trimmed lower branches, in the event of a raging wildfire just like this. And thankfully, the man standing his ground is a firefighter -- and he isn't alone, one of hundreds doing what they can to combat and control the Black Forest Fire that had already singed more than 15,000 acres as of Friday. After a few strategic sprays of water and fire retardant, and a periodic white-out, the scene documented above in a Colorado Springs Fire Department video ends by charring the yard almost right up to the hot tub on the deck, but skirting past the home. Yet for all the happy endings like this one, there are plenty of sad ones: As early Saturday, 473 homes had been destroyed, with at least 15 others suffering partial damage. The destruction isn't always dictated by rhyme or reason: Giselle Hernandez told CNN that her home has been spared so far, but her neighbors to the south lost theirs. ""It just goes to show you how unpredictable these things can be,"" she said. Progress in fighting blaze . This is the second time in a year that the Colorado Springs area has faced a mammoth wildfire. Last summer's Waldo Canyon Fire burned down about 350 homes and 18,000 acres. Some 32,000 evacuated their homes and two people died. They can start, and spread, quickly -- with no regard to what's in their path. That's what happened with the Black Forest Fire after it first flared Tuesday afternoon, for still undetermined reasons. Hernandez remembered how she, her boyfriend and his family spotted smoke and began mulling the possibility of leaving. But that possibility soon turned into a necessity, as the flames rapidly approached. ""It went from, 'Well, we should probably pack and get going,' to, 'We need to leave right now' as the smoke started billowing right through the trees on our property."" Watch: Woman records wildfire evacuation . The wildfire has been blamed for two deaths. In terms of total property lost and damaged, El Paso County spokesman Dave Rose told CNN earlier this week that it appeared to be the most destructive in state history. Some 800 personnel are attacking the blaze, and doing it in sweltering heat: Temperatures climbed to around 90 degrees Friday. In addition to those on the ground, multiple Chinook and Blackhawk helicopters and tankers traversed the air as part of the effort. Authorities spent much of the day Friday surveying most of the 7,000 homes they'd wanted to check to determine which ones made it, which ones did not. Crews had gained ""some tremendous ground"" by morning in identifying hotspots and saving structures, county Sheriff Terry Maketa said. Even so, the blaze was then only 5% contained. Friday, though, proved to be a good day. Skies were at times overcast, temperatures fell somewhat, and there was a strong burst of rain. ""We got our tails kicked for a couple days, yesterday we saw it as a draw, and ... today we delivered some blows,"" Maketa said. Those elements and tactical moves left Rich Harvey, the head of the federal incident management team tackling the blaze, optimistic that crews had turned the corner: They'd gone from being on the defensive to the offensive, Harvey said early Friday evening, estimating 30% containment at that point. Gov. John Hickenlooper was certainly upbeat, after heavy rains doused him Friday as he was walking through a ""burn area."" ""I'm soaking wet and it's a little chilly,"" he said. ""I don't think I've ever been so happy to say that."" Yet he, Harvey and citizens affected by the fire -- like Dale Mielke, who singed his mustache and eyebrows while saving his home but not those of his neighbors -- also stressed that the spurt of heavy rain doesn't mean the fight is over. ""It's not even enough rain to stop it,"" said Mielke, a retired firefighter. ""But it can help slow it down a little bit."" Resident says: 'Things are out of our hands' Carolyn Selvig has been living in this area north of Colorado Springs for 21 years drawn in part by the beauty and peace of the woods. ""The forest is our friend,"" she says. Selvig knows the other side of the equation as well when it comes to living near a forest -- the very real possibility and very real power of wildfires. Are you there? Send an iReport . She and her husband Erik are among roughly 38,000 people -- from about 13,000 homes over a 93,000-acre area -- who have been impacted by the Black Forest Fire. As of midday Friday, their home was still standing, though they can't breathe easy quite yet: Erik Selvig noted ""the intense heat is less than a quarter-mile away."" His wife, Carolyn, admits she's probably ""more worried than I allow myself to think."" Still, she realizes there's little she can do at this point beyond trusting in those fighting to save their home and hoping that Mother Nature is on her side. ""Things are out of our hands,"" she told CNN. ""It is what it is."" The Selvigs are checking, whenever they can, the official list of homes that have been destroyed and those that have not. The Black Forest Fire isn't the only fire affecting Colorado. Southwest of Colorado Springs, the Royal Gorge fire is now 40% contained after four days in which it scorched more than 3,200 acres -- including a beloved carousel and at least 20 buildings, according to Hickenlooper. ""It's burned to a cinder,"" he said of the area. And the governor has declared a disaster emergency in Rocky Mountain National Park, northwest of Denver, due to the Big Meadows Fire that's burned hundreds of acres there. Yes, Coloradans know wildfires are a fact of life; yes, they know that their homes could someday burn. But that doesn't mean dealing with it, in the moment, is easy. Says Chris Schroeder, who is also in the Black Forest Fire evacuation zone, ""It's been a pretty good emotional roller coaster, trying to understand what is happening."" Despite the noted progress on that fire, that ride isn't over. Many have been allowed back in their homes, while others are still being kept. And hundreds of firefighters are still out doing what they can to protect people's property, knowing that a lightning strike or shift of wind can suddenly change everything. ""It is not a done deal: 30% is not 100%,"" Harvey said late Friday afternoon. ""The middle has still got potential.""

"NATO urged Russia to keep its word this time and withdraw troops along Ukraine's eastern border, saying it has seen no signs of soldiers returning to their bases. President Vladimir Putin ordered tens of thousands of troops near the Ukraine border to return to their bases, his spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday. The withdrawal has started, he said, and could take some time to finish. But despite Moscow's assertion, there were no signs of the troops' withdrawal, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said hours later. The Obama administration was skeptical about Putin's order, while Kiev said it's monitoring the area to ensure troops are returning to their permanent bases. ""As you know, we have heard that promise before and have yet to see any indication that it's been fulfilled,"" said Jay Carney, the White House spokesman. Rasmussen reiterated the need for the withdrawal and said he would ""be the first"" to welcome it. ""I think it's the third Putin statement on withdrawal of Russian troops ... but so far we haven't seen any withdrawal at all,""  he said. ""Withdrawal of Russian troops will be the first step to de-escalating the situation."" Ukraine's presidential election scheduled for Sunday is crucial, Rasmussen said, and Russia and Ukrainian separatists should practice restraint to ensure it goes on as planned. ""We urge the armed pro-Russian separatist groups to stop their illegal activities. ... Russia should stop their support for these armed groups,""  he said. ""Russia should demonstrate a clear will to let the presidential election to go forward. The presidential election constitutes the best chance to find a sustainable solution to the crisis in Ukraine."" Russia's 'significant forces' Putin's decision to amass 40,000 troops along Ukraine's eastern border triggered fears of an invasion ahead of the election. Moscow defended the troop buildup, saying it was a routine exercise that has since ended. Two weeks ago, Putin said Russian troops had pulled away from Ukraine's border and were merely conducting ""regular exercises at the test grounds."" At that time, NATO and Western officials said they saw no sign of widespread troop withdrawals. But a senior U.S. administration official disputed Russia's assertion that they were routine exercises . ""The fact is that Russia has been maintaining significant forces in forward deployment areas along Ukraine's border,"" the official said. ""They have not been conducting routine training activities. They've been up on the border in a menacing posture, and we've been concerned about this military buildup and have been consistently calling on Russia to remove its troops back to their home bases and end this threatening behavior."" The official said  the White House is monitoring the issue for evidence of withdrawal. ""As you'll recall, they've made similar claims before. They made them at the end of March and didn't follow through, so we'll be tracking this closely over the course of today and the coming days, and we'll want to see clear, firm evidence of this move before we make any judgment,"" the official said Monday. The United States, which along with other Western countries has sanctioned Russia for its disputed takeover of Crimea, has threatened additional punishment for Russia if it fails to pull its troops back from the border. Tensions in the east . Russian officials have said they reserve the right to protect the interests of Russian citizens and Russian-language speakers in Ukraine's east, which traditionally leans toward Moscow. Tensions in that region remain high, with ongoing reports of violence and growing human rights abuses. Anti-terrorism operations that started in April in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions have killed 24 Ukrainian servicemen so far, said Valentyn Nalyvaichenko, head of the Ukrainian Security Service. He did not provide any more details. In one of the latest incidents, Russian separatists clashed with Ukrainian border guards Saturday after a separatist leader was detained at a checkpoint. Valeriy Bolotov, the self-declared governor of a ""people's republic"" in Luhansk, was detained by security forces in Dovzhanskiy. Attackers freed him after a firefight, but he was wounded and went to Russia for medical treatment, separatist spokesman Vasiliy Nikitin said. Over the weekend, the Russian Foreign Ministry accused Ukrainian troops of attacking Ukrainian citizens and questioned whether Sunday's scheduled elections could be held amid the chaos. ""Such punitive action against its own citizens shows the hypocrisy of the Kiev authorities,"" a ministry statement said, referring to an international pact agreed to last month that called for an end to violence.

"Mark David Chapman, John Lennon's convicted killer, is up for parole for the seventh time and may be questioned as early as Tuesday, authorities said Friday. His latest quest for freedom comes ahead of the 32nd anniversary of the death of the former Beatle, a British singer-songwriter who was gunned down outside his Manhattan apartment on December 8, 1980. Chapman is scheduled to be interviewed by two or three members of the parole board, according to Carole Claren-Weaver, a spokeswoman for the New York Department of Corrections. Chapman's words on the slaying . He was last up for parole in 2010, but was denied because his ""discretionary release remains inappropriate at this time and incompatible with the welfare of the community,"" according to the New York State Division of Parole. He was also denied parole in 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006 and 2008. Chapman, 57, is serving a sentence of 20 years to life in prison, and is being held at the Wende Correctional Facility in Alden, New York.

"The United States said it was taking measures to protect its citizens worldwide after protesters angry about an online film considered offensive to Islam attacked U.S. diplomatic compounds in Libya and Egypt Tuesday. In Libya, witnesses say members of a radical Islamist group called Ansar al-Sharia protested near the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, where NATO jets established no-fly zones last year to halt ground attacks from then-Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi. The group then clashed with security forces in the city, blocking roads leading to the consulate, witnesses said. The U.S. ambassador to Libya, J. Christopher Stevens, was killed in the attack, the State Department said.  Sean Smith, a Foreign Service information management officer, and two other U.S. personnel also died in the violence in Benghazi, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a statement Wednesday. ""Our hearts go out to all their families and colleagues,"" Clinton said. ""All the Americans we lost in yesterday's attacks made the ultimate sacrifice.  We condemn this vicious and violent attack that took their lives, which they had committed to helping the Libyan people reach for a better future,"" she added. In an earlier statement, Clinton said she condemned the attack on the U.S. facilities ""in the strongest terms"" and that following Tuesday's events, the U.S. government was ""working with partner countries around the world to protect our personnel, our missions and American citizens worldwide."" Libya's General National Congress also condemned the attack in Benghazi, saying it ""led to the regrettable injury and death of a number of individuals."" Lawmakers said in a statement Tuesday night that they were investigating. It was unclear whether the two attacks were coordinated, CNN national security contributor Fran Townsend said Tuesday night. ""One such breach of an embassy or consulate's walls or security on any given day would be tremendous news. ... The fact that two of them happened on the same day that is the 9/11 anniversary where Americans are remembering those that we lost, you have to ask yourself, what are American officials trying to understand about this and whether or not these two are related?"" she asked. In Cairo, several men scaled the walls of the U.S. Embassy and tore down its American flag, according to CNN producer Mohamed Fadel Fahmy, who was on the scene. Police and army personnel formed defensive lines around the embassy in an effort to prevent demonstrators from advancing, but not before the protesters affixed a black flag atop a ladder in the American compound. The black flag, which hangs in full view from inside the complex, is adorned with white characters that read, ""There is no God but Allah and Mohammed is his messenger,"" an emblem often used by Islamic radicals. A volley of warning shots were fired as a large crowd gathered around the compound, although it is not clear who fired the shots. Are you there? Share your images and videos. Egyptian groups point to U.S. websites, including YouTube, that have scenes from the film. Some anti-Muslim blogs also have flagged the movie. In a series of disjointed scenes, filmmakers depict Prophet Mohammed as a child molester, womanizer and ruthless killer. The movie was made by Sam Bacile, an Israeli-American real-estate developer, according to the Wall Street Journal. Bacile -- who wrote, directed and produced the film -- said he wanted to showcase his view of Islam as a hateful religion, the Journal reported, citing a telephone interview with him. Bacile, 52, told the newspaper that to make the film, he had raised $5 million from about 100 Jewish donors, who he declined to identify. He said he made the two-hour movie over a three-month period last year in California, using about 60 actors and 45 crew members, the Journal reported. Most of the Muslim world considers depictions of Mohammed to be blasphemous and deeply offensive. ""Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the Internet,"" Clinton said. ""The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation."" But she stressed that ""there is never any justification for violent acts of this kind."" Embassy officials issued a warning to Americans in Egypt, telling them to avoid the demonstrations which ""may gather in front of the U.S. Embassy, or Egyptian government buildings such as the People's Assembly and Ministry of Interior."" ""It is unclear if large numbers will take to the streets, but clashes may occur should two opposing groups come into contact with one another,"" the U.S. Embassy said in a statement. ""Large gatherings and non-essential travel in and around downtown and Garden City should be avoided this afternoon."" Frenzied protesters could been seen Tuesday afternoon holding up bits of a shredded American flag to television camera crews while chanting anti-U.S. slogans. An embassy phone operator told CNN that the compound had been cleared of diplomatic personnel earlier in the day, ahead of the apparent threat, while Egyptian riot police and the army were called in. ""This is an expression of a feeling that is thought to be an insult,"" said Nizih El Naggary, a spokesman for the Egyptian Foreign Ministry. ""But events like this are extremely deplorable. And we have to work to get things under control."" The Foreign Ministry issued a statement Tuesday, pledging to protect embassies and warning of the protests' potentially debilitating effects on the Egyptian economy. ""There are police forces at the demonstrations,"" El Naggary said. ""They should be protecting the embassy and asking people to leave."" Several individuals claimed responsibility for organizing the demonstrations Tuesday, including Salafist leader Wesam Abdel-Wareth, who is president of Egypt's conservative Hekma television channel. Mohamed al-Zawahiri -- the brother of al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri --  added, ""We called for the peaceful protest joined by different Islamic factions including the Islamicc Jihad (and the) Hazem Abu Ismael movement."" ""We were surprised to see the big numbers show up, including the soccer Ultra fans,"" he said. ""I just want to say, how would the Americans feel if films insulting leading Christian figures like the pope or historical figures like Abraham Lincoln were produced?"" He added that ""the film portrays the prophet in a very ugly manner, alluding to topics like sex, which is not acceptable."" The U.S. Embassy in Cairo announced that it had canceled visa services for Wednesday. It also said in a statement that it ""condemns the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of Muslims -- as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions."" ""Respect for religious beliefs is a cornerstone of American democracy,"" the statement said. ""We firmly reject the actions by those who abuse the universal right of free speech to hurt the religious beliefs of others."" But the U.S. Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, suggested that the embassy's statement had its priorities wrong. ""It's disgraceful that the Obama Administration's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions, but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks,"" Romney said in a statement released late Tuesday. He said he was ""outraged"" by the attacks in Libya and Egypt. Obama released a strongly worded statement Wednesday, condemning what he called the ""outrageous attack"" on the Benghazi compound that took the lives of four Americans. ""They exemplified America's commitment to freedom, justice, and partnership with nations and people around the globe, and stand in stark contrast to those who callously took their lives,"" the president said. Obama also announced that he has ordered his administration ""to provide all necessary resources to support the security of our personnel in Libya, and to increase security at our diplomatic posts around the globe. ""While the United States rejects efforts to denigrate the religious beliefs of others, we must all unequivocally oppose the kind of senseless violence that took the lives of these public servants,"" he added. Demonstrations elicited a mixture of reactions from the Egyptian street, where last year tens of thousands turned out in opposition to former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. This summer, Egypt's first Islamist president, Mohamed Morsy, was sworn into power at Tahrir Square, the scene of the nation's revolution in 2011. Though Tuesday's embassy protests are the first that Morsy has dealt with, Egypt recently produced similar scenarios when protesters attacked the Israeli and Syrian embassies in unrelated episodes. ""These protests are a bad image for Egypt,"" said a Cairo street vendor named Ahmed. ""Of course I'm against insulting Islam, but it's the undereducated, poor people who are out here causing problems."" ""All I want for Egypt is security and stability,"" he said. ""And as you can see this isn't it."" The incident occurred on the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks as crowds gathered across the United States in somber remembrance of a day that left nearly 3,000 people dead. Tuesday's focus on the controversial film also drew comparisons to outcry generated from a 2008 movie produced by an anti-Muslim Dutch lawmaker, which then sought to portray Islam as a violent religion. Geert Wilders' film ""Fitna,"" which he released online, featured images of terrorist acts superimposed over verses from the Quran.

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Just two days before the earthquake struck Haiti, 2007 CNN Hero Boby Duval was celebrating the completion of a wall he'd built to surround -- and secure -- his youth program's athletic center in Port-au-Prince. On January 12, when the temblor hit, that wall -- 15 years in the making -- collapsed. ""To have this come to us, it's really beyond imagination. Of all places,"" Duval said of his homeland. Duval has been welcoming children from the slums of Haiti to his sports program, L'Athletique d'Haiti (Athletes of Haiti), since 1996. But today, the field where the kids play is serving as a refuge for Haitian families displaced by the devastating earthquake. Goalposts are being used to build makeshift shelters for some people, while others are sleeping in tents Duval has provided. ""We are saving the concrete blocks. We are trying to keep it secure,"" Duval said. ""What we're trying to do is keep it clean, set up some bathrooms, set up some water and give them care, understanding ... so they are safe here."" Haiti is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere and has a history of political violence, extreme poverty and natural disasters, a history that Duval has witnessed firsthand. Duval, a Haitian who was educated in the United States and Canada, was a national soccer champion in college. When he returned to Haiti, however, he was imprisoned, starved and tortured under the rule of President Jean-Claude (""Baby Doc"") Duvalier. Duval spent 17 months in jail and says he witnessed more than 180 deaths among fellow prisoners. On the brink of death himself and weighing just 90 pounds, Duval's life was saved in 1977, when then-President Carter's administration intervened and demanded the release of all political prisoners in Haiti. Once released, Duval vowed to help make Haiti a better place. He started a support group for former political prisoners and worked as a human rights advocate. Along the way, he realized he wanted to pass on the values that were important to him to a new generation of Haitians. ""If you're gonna change a society, I think you need to give some good foundations to people who are willing to receive those basic values,"" he said. ""The youth are important, because the youth are the future."" In 1996, Duval started L'Athletique d'Haiti, which gives kids from some of the poorest neighborhoods an opportunity to get off the streets, play a sport and receive a daily meal. ""The objective is for me to make a contribution to the Haitian society in terms of the physical, mental and psychological development of the Haitian kid,"" he said. ""To me, the day that I can say that every kid in Haiti has the opportunity to come -- and peacefully and in the best conditions -- develop his mental and physical power, I feel that I can die in peace."" Duval's program has grown to serve 1,500 kids ages 6 to 20 in five locations in Haiti. In addition to athletics, they build social skills and participate in educational and tutoring programs. Now, three weeks after the earthquake shattered Haiti's already fragile infrastructure, the youth of L'Athletique continue to play on the fields of the main Drouillard compound in Port-au-Prince. But now, many live there as well. ""You've got to serve, and you have to save,"" Duval said. ""That's what we've got to do now."" Want to get involved? Check out Boby Duval's Web site and see how to help.","Youth program's athletic field serves as refuge for families displaced by quake .

"Former rap star Flavor Flav was arrested Wednesday in Las Vegas, Nevada, and charged with assault with a deadly weapon and battery in a case involving his fiancee of eight years, police said. Police were called to their house on the city's south side at 3:30 a.m., according to a domestic battery report issued by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, which offers the following account of events: . Flav, whose real name is William J. Drayton, 53, was arguing with the woman, Elizabeth Trujillo, 39. The two had gotten into a ""verbal altercation due to Drayton cheating on Trujillo,"" it said. The argument continued in the downstairs bedroom, where ""Drayton became physical."" ""Trujillo stated Drayton grabbed her by the shoulders, stomach and arms, and threw her to the ground two separate times,"" it continued, adding that Trujillo said an earring was ripped out of her ear during the incident. At that point, Trujillo's 17-year-old son, Gibran, began wrestling with Drayton in the living room of the four-bedroom, 2-1/2-bath house, Trujillo told police. Drayton -- who is 5 feet, 6 inches tall and weighs 131 pounds -- grabbed two knives from the kitchen and chased his fiancee's son -- who is 6 feet, 175 pounds -- ""around the living room, threatening to kill Gibran,"" the teen told police, according to the report. When the teenager locked himself and his sister Kayla inside her room, Drayton kicked in the door ""and began making threats to kill Gibran,"" according to the report. Though Drayton ""confirmed the stories told by Gibran and Trujillo,"" he denied having chased or threatened to kill the teenager, the report said. Drayton is scheduled for an initial hearing on Thursday morning. During the incident, Drayton cut a finger with one of the knives he was holding. The assault charge carries a $20,000 bond; the battery charge carries a $3,000 bond. It was not clear whether he had a lawyer. During the 1980s and 1990s, Drayton was a member of the militant rap group Public Enemy. Its biggest hit, ""Fight the Power,"" served as a soundtrack to the Spike Lee film ""Do the Right Thing."" The group, which has been nominated for induction next year into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, ""brought a new level of conceptual sophistication to the hip-hop album, and a new level of intensity and power to live hip-hop, inspiring fans from Jay-Z to Rage Against the Machine to Kurt Cobain,"" according to the organization's website. ""After Public Enemy, hip-hop could never again be dismissed as kids' music.""","Police say he got into an altercation with his fiancee, then threatened her son .

"He's got blue wings, an adventurous spirit and is poised to be the latest film star to come out of South Africa. A high-spirited young falcon, Kai is the main character in ""Zambezia,"" a new South African 3D animation film featuring an all-star voice cast, including Hollywood A-listers Samuel L. Jackson, Abigail Breslin, Jeff Goldblum, Leonard Nimoy and Jeremy Suarez. Set in the majestic Victoria Falls and inspired by southern Africa's startling artwork, ""Zambezia"" is hoping to put South African animation on the map while enthralling children around the world with its uplifting message of togetherness. The movie, produced by Cape Town-based Triggerfish Animation Studios, has been selected as the closing film of the 33rd edition of the Durban International Film Festival, which runs until July 29. ""The film is a wonderful ambassador, in a way, of South Africa and I think as it travels the world it's going to spread the word about an industry that is young and vibrant and extremely talented,"" says ""Zambezia"" director and co-writer Wayne Thornley. ""In and of itself, I think it's just an enjoyable ride for children and they're going to come away wishing they could fly."" Read more: The film school in Kenya's biggest slum . The movie, which is targeted toward children aged five to 11, tells the story of Kai, an intrepid young falcon that's brought up by his strict father in an isolated outpost. His lonely life is turned upside down when a kooky bird crashes into his world and tells him of Zambezia -- a bustling bird city where ""there's amazing food, music, sights and sounds."" A talented flier, Kai decides to leave his isolated upbringing behind him and explore life in Zambezia. He quickly realizes, however, that getting by in a city can be more difficult and demanding than living alone. Yet, after joining Zambezia's air force and defending it from a band of marauding lizards, he also discovers the true values of teamwork and community sharing. Thornley says the movie was guided by the traditional African principle of ubuntu, which he describes roughly as ""a person is a person only because of other people"" -- he says that the movie's heartwarming theme will resonate with both African and international audiences. ""Everyone can relate to that idea that it's better, it's easier to do things together, that teams are just more vibrant and get more things done,"" he says. ""They are difficult and messy and it's not always easy but it is worth it -- I think that's a universal theme and I hope that audiences around the world come away with that kind of message going: it's safer to stay alone but it's not better."" Read more: Film pioneer helps Rwanda build new identity . The concept for the movie originated about seven years ago but production took just over two years to be completed. The third computer generated 3D film to be made in South Africa, ""Zambezia"" is  ""probably the biggest budget animated film ever to come out of anywhere in Africa,"" says Thornley  -- Triggerfish was unable to disclose how much the film cost, but said its budget was under $20 million. The movie's international appeal is expected to be raised by the high-profile roster of actors lending their voices to the characters. Thornley says it all became possible after well-known U.S. producer Mace Neufeld saw the film by chance. ""He liked what he saw and he finally got involved and started opening doors for us."" Read more: 'Netflix of Africa' brings Nollywood to world . Working with top Hollywood stars such as Jackson and Goldblum was ""an honor"" and ""really fun"", says Thornley. ""It was gratifying that they treated it seriously like any project,"" he says. ""We tend to think of ourselves that we're this little studio but they were fantastic and it was really a great experience,"" he adds. ""Zambezia"" had its world premiere at France's Annecy Animation Festival last month and was released in Israel earlier in July. It will hit the big screen in Germany and Switzerland on August 30, while its South Africa release is scheduled for December 26. It has already been sold in more than 30 territories for screening in over 50 countries, including a distribution deal in English-speaking territories with Sony, according to Triggerfish Animation. Thornley says South Africa's animation industry is still young and small but it is ""definitely punching above its weight."" ""I want people to sit back and have a fantastic time with the characters and have a fantastic insight into some of the amazing African landscapes that we've put into this film,"" says Thornley. ""But also I want them to come away really surprised that something like that could come out of Africa and South Africa in particular.""","""Zambezia"" is a new South African 3D animation feature film .

"End it like Beckham. One of the most iconic football stars of his generation, David Beckham is to retire at the end of the season to bring down the curtain on a glittering career. As well as winning over 100 caps for his England and lifting 19 trophies in two different continents, it was his ability to maximize the power of the ""Beckham brand"" that allowed the footballer to transcend his sport and appeal to a worldwide mass audience. Beckham's marriage to former Spice Girl and fashion designer, Victoria, probably helped as well. ""Brand Beckham is dead, long live Brand Beckham!"" sports business expert Simon Chadwick told CNN. ""Beckham's transition from athlete commodity to sporting statesman and entrepreneur is now complete."" This year, Beckham became the first ever sportsman from outside of China to be invited to become the ambassador for the sport in the country. He is estimated to be Britain's wealthiest sportsman, earning in excess of $46 million a year, according to France Football magazine. ""I wouldn't have achieved what I have done today without my family,"" said Beckham in a statement. ""I'm grateful for my parents' sacrifice, which made me realise my dreams. ""I owe everything to Victoria and the kids, who have given me the inspiration and support to play at the highest level for such a long period."" Beckham's decision to retire comes days after the 38-year-old won his latest title with French club Paris Saint-Germain. ""I'm thankful to PSG for giving me the opportunity to continue but I feel now is the right time to finish my career, playing at the highest level,"" added Beckham. The Englishman, who won the Champions League with Manchester United in 1999, also won league titles with Real Madrid and Los Angeles Galaxy before arriving in the French capital earlier this year after signing a short-term contract. ""If you had told me as a young boy I would have played for and won trophies with my boyhood club Manchester United, proudly captained and played for my country over one hundred times and lined up for some of the biggest clubs in the world, I would have told you it was a fantasy,"" said Beckham. ""I'm fortunate to have realized those dreams."" Despite playing for some of the world's top clubs, Beckham singled out captaining his country as one of his ""proudest achievements"". ""I knew every time I wore the Three Lions shirt, I was not only following in a long line of great players, I was also representing every fan that cared passionately about their country,"" said Beckham, who won 115 caps for England. ""I'm honoured to represent England both on and off the pitch. I want to thank all my team-mates, the great managers that I had the pleasure of learning from. ""I also want to thank the fans who have all supported me and given me the strength to succeed.'' Beckham had the chance to join PSG in January 2012, but opted to stay in the U.S., ending his American mission with his second MLS Cup title before announcing that he would not fulfill the second year of his contract extension. ""Nothing will ever completely replace playing the game I love, however I feel like I'm starting a new adventure and I'm genuinely excited about what lies ahead,"" said Beckham. ""I'm fortunate to have been given many opportunities throughout my career and now I feel it's my time to give back."" Many of Beckham's former teammates and managers spoke of the positive impact his professionalism had on the clubs he played for. ""He was a great teammate and a role model for young players,"" said LA Galaxy Bruce Arena. ""He had achieved so much, but wanted to keep on achieving."" But former PSG winger David Ginola told CNN that he had had a conversation with Beckham a few weeks ago when the Englishman confided he had begun to question his fitness to play at the highest level. Not that Beckham's playing career is quite over -- yet. French Champions PSG's last two games are against Brest at the Parc des Princes in the French capital on Saturday and at Lorient the following Sunday. Meanwhile on Twitter, messages of congratulations poured in from some of his former teammates and clubs and even politicians. ""Best wishes as David #BeckhamRetires His magical free kicks for @MUFC and England will live long in the memory of all football fans,"" tweeted British Prime Minister David Cameron.","Former England captain David Beckham retires from football .

"Hero or agitator? Exposer of wrongdoing or threat to the state? Robert MacLean has been called many things as he fights the federal government over his firing, for what he says was retaliation after he exposed cracks in the nation's air passenger security. But the Obama administration counters the former federal air marshal's leaks to the media were specifically prohibited by law, and could have had catastrophic consequences. Now the U.S. Supreme Court for the first time will hear a case involving a federal whistleblower. At issue is whether a government employee who makes a disclosure ""specifically prohibited by law"" -- in this case, security information -- is still immune from employer retaliation. A federal appeals court had earlier decided MacLean's disclosures deserve whistleblower protection. The government then asked the justices to intervene. Oral arguments are set for next Tuesday morning. Tom Devine, a lawyer with the Government Accountability Project who is representing MacLean, said he is ""chomping at the bit"" to argue that MacLean's leak was in the national interest, saying it may have helped prevent terrorist attacks on the United States. The Transportation Security Administration and the Justice Department declined comment, as is custom in a pending legal case. MacLean, now a resident of Orange County, California who sells residential solar systems, hopes a Supreme Court ruling in his favor will eventually lead to his return to the ranks of the Federal Air Marshal Service, which places armed, plain-clothes officers on commercial airplanes. The case began in July of 2003, when MacLean, then based in Las Vegas, tipped off an MSNBC reporter the TSA was suspending overnight missions just days after air marshals were briefed about a new ""potential plot"" to hijack U.S. airliners. The agency planned the cutback -- which would have kept air marshals off most long-distance flights -- because it was then running out of money at the end of a fiscal year. MacLean also said he had privately voiced his concerns to his government supervisors. The news caused an immediate uproar on Capitol Hill, with Sen. Charles Schumer, and then-Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton and John Kerry, among others, writing letters expressing concerns. The TSA retreated, killing the scheduling cuts before they went into effect. A year later, MacLean appeared on NBC News -- in disguise and identified only as ""Federal Air Marshal 'Mike'"" -- to criticize the agency's dress policy, which, he said, made it easier for terrorists to identify the undercover air marshals. But someone from the TSA recognized MacLean's voice -- the Justice Department said he used ""a disguise that proved to be inadequate"" -- and the agency ordered an investigation into MacLean for an ""unauthorized media appearance."" During that investigation, he admitted leaking information to the media about the 2003 suspension of long-distance flights. The agency fired MacLean in April of 2006, saying his leak was an unauthorized disclosure of ""Sensitive Security Information,"" or SSI. Supporters say MacLean brought to public light a TSA action that violated federal law, which mandates that the agency give priority to flights that present high security risks, specifically mentioning ""nonstop, long distance flights."" They say the information he gave was factual and that it ultimately protected passengers by changing a flawed policy. MacLean argued the information he disclosed was not Sensitive Security Information, saying the TSA sent the information as a text message on his cell phone, instead of as an encrypted message on his password-protected pager. And it was not labeled SSI. The former Air Force veteran and Border Patrol agent said his firing was retaliation for his union activities. But the Merit System Protection Board -- an independent government agency with jurisdiction to review federal personnel actions -- said that even if the scheduling directive was not labeled SSI, deployment information was ""within the definition of SSI."" MacLean ""admittedly knew that he was not permitted to tell anyone about (air marshal) scheduling, yet he did so anyway, and it could have created a significant security risk,"" the board said. The board also concluded there is ""no direct evidence"" the agency retaliated or discriminated against MacLean for his union activities. But the Washington-based federal appeals court later reversed, holding MacLean had met the threshold of being eligible for whistleblower protection. If he wins at the high court, MacLean would have to go back to the board and further demonstrate that he reasonably believed that his disclosures ""evidenced a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety."" ""Frankly, that's a hearing we would relish because there's little question that his disclosures were worthy,"" said Devine, MacLean's attorney. ""Numerous members of Congress attacked (the travel cuts) as betraying the department's (responsibilities). The Department of Homeland Security said it was a mistake and canceled the orders less than 48 hours after his disclosure. They only corrected the mistake because of his disclosure."" The tricky legal issue is whether the revelations were ""specifically prohibited by law,"" as the statute indicates. The Justice Department will tell the nine justices that these kinds of leaks are covered, since ""the phrase 'by law' is presumed to include both statutes and substantive regulations that have the force and effect of law."" ""In the course of its efforts to secure the nation's transportation network, the TSA necessarily develops and acquires a great deal of information, including information about security vulnerabilities, that has the potential to cause extreme harm if publicly disclosed,"" government lawyers wrote to the court. ""The (lower court's) decision in this case, however, effectively permits individual federal employees to override the TSA's judgments about the dangers of public disclosure."" But MacLean, supported by a range of lawmakers and advocacy groups, strongly disagrees. Six bipartisan members of Congress -- including Sens. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa; and Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, told the court they ""know that whistleblowers are more likely to come forward when they can do so without fear of reprisal."" A ruling for the government ""would open the door to agency over-reach in suppressing inconvenient information, as decades of experience confirms,"" said the legislative group, which includes four congressmen. ""Just from reading the statute, it is far from clear whether the particular information MacLean disclosed is included"" in the DHS rules. MacLean continues his personal crusade with an active website and unflinching mission. In testimony to Congress last month, the married father of three called it ""a whistleblowing experience I never wanted to have. But it forced me to make the most difficult choices and decisions of my life, about my duty to the country as a public servant and law enforcement officer."" The case is Department of Homeland Security v. MacLean (13-894). A ruling is due by the spring of 2015.","Robert MacLean was fired as a federal air marshal in 2006 .

"You've probably heard this one before: Little guy gets too close to a trademark held by a big company. Big company threatens legal action. Little guy backs off. But have you heard the one where the small business owner responds to a cease and desist order from Starbucks with a satirical letter and a check for $6? At issue: A craft beer called ""Frappicino."" But we're getting ahead of ourselves. Let's start at the beginning. Jeff Briton owns the Exit 6 Pub and Brewery in Cottleville, Missouri. He has for two and a half years. The place isn't a fancy gastro pub, in fact, it doesn't even have a kitchen. It does one thing and does it well: serve craft beer seven days a week, starting at 4 p.m. A beer is born . Last January, Briton mixed two of his creations together: A vanilla crème and a chocolate coffee ale. The result, according to a customer, tasted a whole lot like a certain blended coffee ice beverage served at the more than 5,500 Starbucks locations worldwide. The customer wrote about the creation on a beer website, Un Tapped, and called it a ""Frappicino"" --  one letter off from the Starbucks trademarked name. Fast forward 11 months. Cease and desist . Last week, Briton received a letter from Starbucks' lawyers, asking him to stop using the name. ""The FRAPPICINO mark only differs from Starbucks Coffee Co.'s FRAPPUCCINO mark by one letter,"" the letter said, ""and is phonetically identical."" The bar's use of the name would cause ""confusion"" among buyers, it added. The message was clear: you violated our trademark. Stop. But in the black and white legalese, Briton saw an opportunity. ""This huge law firm sends me this letter,"" Briton told CNN on Monday night. ""How many hours did that lawyer have to spend in sending that out?"" Briton says he reckons that Starbucks spent more in law firm billable hours than he made in the entire month of December. In other words, Briton felt he had to respond. 'We're poor spelers' Addressing his response to the lawyer and ""Mr. Bucks,"" he referred to the offending beverage and trademark as ""The F Word"" so as to fend off further litigation risk. ""It has recently come to the Exit 6 Pub and Brewerys attention that there were 3 check ins to the beer with a very similar name to the ""F Word"". Unfortunately it was only similar to the F Word because we meant to call it the same thing. Lucky for us, we're poor spelers."" ""We just feel awful about calling a beer the F Word,"" the letter went on. ""We are bad people. We feel shame."" And while Briton wrote that he would stop calling the beer ""The F Word,"" he also wanted to reassure Mr. Bucks that he and his customers meant no harm. ""I guess that with there being a Starbucks on every corner of every block in every city that some people may think they could get a Starbucks at a local bar,"" he wrote. ""So that was our mistake."" Check in the mail . Briton said he wanted to make amends. So, in an effort to ""remain in good standings,"" he included a check for the ""full amount of profit gained"" from sales of the offending brew. Total number of beers sold: three. The check to Starbucks: $6. People love stories about little guys standing up to corporations with big pockets. And soon, Briton's story was splashed all over mainstream media. ""Even someone very inebriated should not find coffee and beer to be confusingly similar,"" wrote Mike Sandburg on the bar's Facebook page. Added Mindy Schildroth: ""I think you should name your next beer Six Bucks!"" And Martin Lawler said he'd fly from Oakhurst, California, just to order the beer. ""And I don't like stouts!!"" Request was 'respectful' Laurel Harper, a manager for Starbucks communication, told CNN the request her company sent to Briton was ""respectful."" ""Just like many businesses, trademark law requires all companies, including Starbucks, to consistently protect its brand,"" she said via e-mail. ""We always prefer to resolve trademark disputes informally and amicably whenever possible, and we appreciate Exit 6 Pub and Brewery respecting our request to avoid confusion among customers."" Harper told CNN she hadn't heard about Briton's check. She said Starbucks wouldn't be cashing it. The experience prompted Briton to stop producing another beer, he said tongue planted firmly in cheek: .

"With over 700 million active smartphone users, China's mobile market is insane in scale. But sheer numbers aside, what makes it really impressive? China has long been a mere manufacturer. Products, usually designed elsewhere, get assembled here. And when China's mobile industry creates, it's often churning out low-end handsets and that occasional shameless copycat app. But one former Silicon Valley insider says China is no longer a factory hub lacking imagination. It has become a hotbed of crazy innovation. ""People think about China as copycats, but they don't expect to see the kind of innovation that they see here when they arrive,"" says Hugo Barra, former Google executive and current Vice President of Chinese cult smartphone maker Xiaomi. Local spice . Barra cites Didi -- a local taxi calling app with over 100 million users across 178 Chinese cities -- as an example of ""made-in-China"" mobile innovation. He says its built-in messaging service to explain hard-to-find addresses and a haggling option to sweeten an offer during rush hour make it more than just ""the Uber of China."" ""Didi is a phenomenal example of the 'local spice,' it's an innovation that I like talking about,"" says Barra. ""Because it's an app for calling a taxi, there is no big deal in that. But the way it was built, it's actually pretty clever."" When Barra ditched Google for Xiaomi last year, his move made international headlines. ""Some of my friends were astonished that I would move all the way out to China,"" he says. ""But most of the people that I worked with are software engineers who knew what was happening here. They weren't as surprised."" Global app culture . China's mobile stars are gaining on their Silicon Valley rivals thanks in part to their marketing prowess and innovation. Xiaomi outsells the Apple iPhone in China. It claims to have a valuation of $10 billion, and plans to sell 60 million of its customized Android-powered smartphones this year in China and in its first overseas market, Singapore. Beijing's Momo -- a networking and, yes, flirting app -- has over 100 million registered users. Launched for Chinese users in 2011, it predates its Western rival Tinder. Shenzhen-based Tencent boasts a market cap bigger than HP. It has a vast portfolio of businesses including the wildly popular mobile messaging app WeChat. With 272 million monthly users, WeChat is not only a rival to Viber and WhatsApp. It's turned into the extended operating system of China's mobile millions. ""Starting from messaging, it's now extended to e-commerce, gaming, socializing, and posting your pictures,"" says Andy Tian, former Google exec and CEO of the Beijing-based mobile startup Asia Innovations. ""And it's the only place where you can actually get a taxi nowadays on a street in Beijing."" Tina Tao, Chief Operating Officer for the startup incubator Innovation Works, believes WeChat is on its way to becoming a truly global brand. And it's one of many more to come thanks to the global mindset of China's mobile developers. ""They have adopted things not only from their local market, but from the Internet culture of other countries,"" says Tao. ""So they have grown up with the global concept and global culture from day one."" Beijing blessings . China's mobile might is driven by a rich talent pool of globally-minded and highly-educated developers. Getting the blessing of Beijing doesn't hurt either. ""The government is actively molding entrepreneurial innovation here all the way from loosening restrictions for new companies to reducing the annual audit requirement,"" says Tian. ""Politics and innovation are actually aligned."" Barra concurs: ""I see the Chinese government as probably one of the most involved governments that I've ever experienced when it comes to tech, in a positive way."" ""We can get introductions literally to any mobile operator who are partners that we work with, anywhere in the world, through the embassies, through the chambers of commerce and so on. There's a system built to make these things happen."" And yes, this is the same government that censors the mobile Internet in China. But China's tech players don't see that as an operating risk, just the legal lay of the land. ""You want to build a good product or good community to fulfill your users,"" says Tao. ""And second, you have to fulfill the government requirement."" China's mobile stars are backed by Beijing, powered by top talent, and also road tested by some of the toughest customers on the planet. Tian calls China's home market ""intense"" in their mobile usage and is ""one of the hardest consumers to get money from."" In this environment, it's best to keep the focus on the road ahead and not on any pirates or copycats who may come your way. ""We always say the idea is worthless, you need execution and don't worry about your idea being copied by others,"" says Tao. ""Otherwise, even if you have a good idea in the first place, you cannot succeed."" It's the mantra of China's mobile mavens. Execute fast, or die. Three top Chinese mobile apps to know . 1. For networking (read: flirting): Momo predates Tinder and has over 100 million registered users. 2. For getting a cab: Didi has a built in messaging service and a haggling option. 3. For everything else: WeChat is a mobile messaging service that has now extended to e-commerce, gaming, and photo sharing.","Contrary to its reputation, China is a hotbed of mobile innovation .

"He may be one of the most famous faces on the planet and earning in excess of $46 million a year, according to France Football magazine, but David Beckham admits he does not have it all. In an interview with CNN, the Paris Saint-Germain midfielder has spoken of the daily anguish he suffers while living in France. For the former England captain, preparing for Tuesday's glamour Champions League quarterfinal clash with Barcelona, is finding it hard to be apart from his wife Victoria and their four children, all of whom are now based in London. Beckham to donate PSG wages to charity . He may be living in one of Paris' finest hotels, occupying a suite at Le Bristol that features marble bathrooms and one of the world's best chefs and costs thousands of dollars per night, but Beckham says he has an even higher price to pay by staying in the French capital. ""That's the sacrifice I have to make as a father and as a husband: being away from my family,"" he told CNN. ""It is only for a short time, but it's difficult being away from the children every single day. But they understand it. They understand that Daddy works hard."" Beckham says that his eldest child, 14-year-old Brooklyn, is also beginning to understand the limitations of having one of the world's biggest celebrities as a father. ""My eldest now is at the age where he wants to do things and go to places, and we have to hold him back,"" said the recently appointed ambassador for Chinese football. ""You have to explain to him that there are certain things that he can't do. But to be honest, we let our children do 99% of the things they want to do, because we want them to lead a normal life."" The former Manchester United and Real Madrid star joined the French side in January, and although the original deal was for five months only, PSG President Nasser Al-Khelafi told French daily L'Equipe on Monday that he is keen to retain Beckham's services for next season as well. The club's Italian coach Carlo Ancelotti has also indicated a desire to retain Beckham, who makes the short flight home to the city of his birth on a regular basis to spend time with his kids, who go to school in the English capital. Such overtures may leave Beckham with a  difficult decision to make when his deal expires in May, but with his wife keen to settle back in London after nearly a decade away -- following stays in Spain and LA Galaxy in the United States -- and the footballer saying he will never play for any English club other than Manchester United, the proximity of Paris may well be his best option. And there's no denying that the 1999 Champions League winner is relishing his return to the limelight of European football's finest competition in the twilight of his career. ""To be asked to come and play here was obviously an honor and something that I was excited about. They have big plans at the club, and rightly so,"" said a man who has made six PSG appearances, all but two of which have come as a substitute. Beckham becomes new face of Chinese football . ""Paris is an amazing city, amazing culture. The club has not been around for many years, and the success that they want to achieve is doable."" Founded in 1970, PSG faces one of the biggest nights in its history when hosting four-time European champions Barcelona, who last won the Champions League in 2011, on Tuesday. With Lionel Messi continually making his case to be regarded as the greatest player in history and coach Tito Vilanova having returned after cancer treatment in New York, knocking Barcelona out of the Champions League would be one of the biggest achievements for a club that has never been crowned the kings of Europe. ""Without doubt, they are one of the best teams ever,"" said Beckham, who played for Barca's great rivals Real Madrid between 2003 and 2007. ""They've got some of the best players individually and collectively, and I think that's what makes them the team they are. It's not about just Messi or Xavi; they have a unit that works together so well. That's why they've been successful over the years. ""They've got the best player in the world in their team (Messi), they've got committed players, and that's what makes them a special team. ""It's a huge test for us, a huge game for this club and for this city."" To date, the most important European trophy claimed by PSG is the now-defunct Cup Winners Cup, which the Parisians lifted in 1996, but the club's Qatari owners, who have spent heavily on Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Lucas Moura and Thiago Silva to name but a few, are hoping their massive injections of cash can change all that. ""Being part of a club that is looking to the future and looking to become a bigger success than they have in the last few years -- I wanted to be part of that,"" said Beckham of his decision to join PSG, which has two solitary league titles (1986, 1994). And a man who has played at three World Cups for England has not ruled out adding to his 115 caps, a tally no other outfield player in the long history of the 1966 world champions can beat. ""One of the reasons why I've never retired from the England team is because if there's ever an opportunity to play for them again, then I'm available,"" he said. ""If there is any chance of me ever playing for my country again, I would never turn that down. ""I'm almost 38 years old, so the chances are very slight, but you never know,"" said a man approaching middle age but whose childhood dreams remain strong.","Beckham speaks of the sacrifice he suffers being in Paris while his family are in London .

"U.S. officials will review the nation's lung transplant policy for children, but any change could take up to two years, not enough time to save the life of a 10-year-old Pennsylvania girl who's already been waiting 18 months for new lungs. United Network for Organ Sharing, a nonprofit that manages the nation's transplant system under federal contract, agreed to the review Friday, the same day that an urgent request was made by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, UNOS spokeswoman Anne Paschke said. But because the review process involves research and public comment and because there's not enough organ donations for children, the nation's transplant system won't likely be able to save the life of Sarah Murnaghan, who could die within weeks without a transplant of lungs. When pressed on this emerging reality, Paschke stated: ""I don't have anything additional to add."" Paschke urged more Americans to look at an organ donation website. Paschke added in a subsequent e-mail to CNN: ""With 18 people dying on the wait list every day in this country, the only way to save more lives is with more donors,"" she said. ""Just one organ donor can save the lives of up to 8 people."" Sebelius asked for a review of the nation's transplant system Friday. ""I ask that you pay particular attention to the age categories currently used in lung allocation, and review the policy with the intent of identifying any potential improvements to this policy that would make more transplants available to children,"" Sebelius said in a letter to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network. Sarah's struggle has ignited a fight for new rules governing organ donations. She's been in a Philadelphia hospital for months due to cystic fibrosis that she's had since birth. Tens of thousands of people have signed a petition on Change.org, and a congressman has called on the Obama administration to take quick action. The girl is eligible for a lung from another child but isn't prioritized for a lung from an adult, under federal rules. With just weeks left, Sarah fights the system for life-saving pair of lungs . Sibelius asked for the review of the federal policy in a letter to Dr. John Roberts, board president of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network. Sibelius cited the significant disparity in the number of transplantable organs to the number of people in need of an organ, especially among pediatric patients. She also directed the Health Resources and Services Administration Division of Transplantation to consider new approaches for promoting pediatric and adolescent organ donation. ""With 1,819 pediatric patients on organ transplant waitlists and only 852 pediatric organ transplant donors each year, it is especially clear that we can and should, if possible, do more to encourage the public to become registered organ donors,"" Sibelius wrote. Sarah is at the top of the list for any pediatric lungs that may become available for transplant in her region. She's been waiting for 18 months. None have come along. But doctors say modified adult lungs could help save her -- and adult lungs become available much more often. That's where the rules becomes a problem. Children under age 12 aren't prioritized for adult organs. So Sarah could only get available adult lungs if everyone else waiting for lungs in her region -- no matter how sick they are -- turns them down. Sarah's mother, Janet Murnaghan, told CNN she was ""shocked"" when she learned the rules a couple of weeks ago. Organ donation by the numbers .","Transplant policy change could take 2 years; girl needs lung transplant within weeks .

"He is lauded as one of Africa's most unique voices, with a fanbase stretching across the world, but South African singing sensation Vusi Mahlasela remains faithful to his roots. For more than 20 years, the legendary singer has been celebrated globally for his powerful vocals and universal messages of freedom and human kindness. He has toured the world extensively and collaborated with major music stars such as Sting, Paul Simon and Dave Matthews. But despite all his success and international acclaim, Mahlasela still resides in Mamelodi, the small township northeast of Pretoria where he grew up and nurtured his passion and talent for music. He says it all started for him here. ""Quite a lot of inspirations and also some of the songs that I wrote, I penned them here in Mamelodi,"" says Mahlasela, who is known in South Africa as ""The Voice."" ""I still have very strong connections with this place,"" he adds.  ""I feel rooted and connected to this place, I love it."" A humble star, Mahlaselaʼs roots are reflected in his songs and lyrics, many written during one of the toughest times in South Africaʼs history -- the fight against apartheid. Somali rapper K'naan makes songs in the key of love . Perhaps his most famous song, ""When You Come Back,"" has become an anthem in the country, celebrating the return of those who escaped apartheid and lived in exile. Mahlasela says the song's hopeful lyrics, written years before South Africaʼs democratic change, were also for those arrested, like former South African president Nelson Mandela -- not surprisingly, Mahlasela was asked in 1994 to perform at Mandelaʼs inauguration. Passionate about spreading the traditional African philosophy, Ubuntu, many of Mahlaselaʼs global tours throughout his career have been benefit concerts. He has also become an ambassador to the 46664 foundation -- named after Mandelaʼs prison number and dedicated to raising awareness about HIV/AIDS. ""That spirit of collective good, it's still in the principle of ubuntu,"" he says. ""Everyday kindness, love, forgiveness, reconciliation, so everything about us that makes us human."" Honoring a career that spans 20 years and 10 albums, Mahlasela was recently given a lifetime achievement award in South Africa. Watch: Vusi Mahlasela's creative process . The singer is now focusing on helping younger generations, supporting Africaʼs future generation of musicians and songwriters through the foundation he created in 2000. ""It is to give music lessons, but also to develop even those who are playing already and we do have outreach programs for primary schools,"" says Mahlasela. ""They're trying to encourage the schools and the governments to give lessons to the young ones and to encourage also the musicians or the students to start picking up folk, indigenous, traditional instruments, because it's something that they really have to be proud of and to infuse them with Western instruments."" On stage, Ubuntu shines through. Mahlaselaʼs distinctive vocals blend in wonderfully with his enchanting music, taking the listeners on an emotional journey. ""My music is sort of more accessible to every listener, young and old, they love my music,"" he says. ""And I've seen it also happen that I have also gotten that energy back from the people -- performing and after that when I'm going out there to sign CDs people will come to me with quite a lot of different great compliments, so it gives me the pleasurable feeling that I can really give something to the people and that will really change their lives to the better.""","With over 20 years experience, Vusi Mahlasela is one of Africa's most lauded singers .

"(CNN)It could be billed as the billionaires' derby. A clash between Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday signals the business end in this season's Europe's money-spinning Champions League competition has landed. Chelsea, a comfortable leader in the English Premier League, faces off against Paris Saint-Germain, which is in contention for a third successive league crown in France. Among its many intriguing plot lines is a battle between two of football's biggest egos: Chelsea's irascible, but eminently quotable, manager Jose Mourinho, and PSG striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, a walking well of self confidence. It also sees the London club's Russian owner Roman Abramovich put his expensively assembled side up against an equally star-studded Parisian outfit, which is owned by Qatar Sports Investments. Throw in a chance for PSG to avenge its elimination from last year's competition at the quarterfinal stage, and David Luiz meeting the side that sold him to the Paris club for a reported fee of $76 million in May, and it has all the makings of a classic. Who has the biggest ego out of Mourinho and Ibrahimovic? How long have you got? These two possess such magnetic personalities a simple televised conversation between them on CNN would probably attract an audience of millions. Of course, Mourinho is the man who arrived for his first spell at Chelsea after having guided Porto to the Champions League title and promptly informed the British press that he was ""a special one."" A litany of trophies has followed in his subsequent stints at Italian club Inter Milan -- a haul that included another Champions League title -- and Spanish giants Real Madrid, but also a long charge sheet of controversy. As well as a series of spats with fellow managers, Mourinho famously poked then Barcelona assistant manager Tito Vilanova in the eye after a touchline melee -- this a few seasons after he charged onto the Camp Nou pitch to celebrate Inter's victory over Barca in a Champions League semifinal. Ibrahimovic is as good a match as any for Mourinho's ego in the game of soccer. Richly talented, and as enigmatic as they come, the Swede recently suggested a statue of him could replace the Eiffel Tower. His recent autobiography 'I Am Zlatan' was utterly self-aggrandizing and all the more entertaining for it, filled with hubris along the same lines as his response when asked what gift he would get his girlfriend for her birthday. ""Nothing,"" he replied. ""She already has Zlatan."" He has played for a selection of the world's biggest clubs -- Juventus, Barcelona, Inter Milan, as well as AC Milan, and now PSG -- scoring spectacular goals wherever he has been. The Portuguese managed Ibrahimovic for just one solitary season when they were at Inter together, the latter saying in his book: ""Mourinho would become a guy I was basically willing to die for."" At the end of the 2008/09 season, Inter having won Serie A for the third straight season and Ibrahimovic finishing as the league's top scorer with 25 goals, the Swede left for Barcelona in search of a Champions League crown. But it was Mourinho and Inter who won it the following season. Now the pair go head-to-head; Ibrahimovic is yet to win Europe's top club prize, Mourinho is gunning for his third. How rich are the clubs' respective owners? Mega-rich. Abramovich made his money from the controversial privatization of the Russian oil fields and is currently worth an estimated $9 billion, according to Forbes. After purchasing the club in 2003 Abramovich transformed them from also-ran into a major force with a series of lavish spending sprees on players, outlaying nearly $3bn in his first 10 years. Notoriously reticent, the 48-year-old has never offered any public statement or fluff piece on the club's website to explain any of his decisions, one of which was to hand Mourinho a huge payoff at the end of his first stint at the club. Though the Portuguese delivered a first English league title in over 50 years during his first season at the helm, it was the Champions League crown that Abramovich desperately craved. After running through a series of high-profile managers since, Chelsea's first ever European Cup was actually delivered by a caretaker manager and former player -- Roberto Di Matteo, who took over after Andre Villas-Boas was sacked after just nine months at the helm. Even after delivering the ultimate prize, Di Matteo himself lasted just three months the following season before he was dismissed by the Russian. Recently, Abramovich has curtailed his extravagant spending to ensure Chelsea complies with Financial Fair Play (FFP), a directive from European football's governing body that insists all clubs must live within its means. Chelsea have recouped around $215 million in recent seasons through player sales, a large chunk of which came through the sale of Luiz to PSG, and recorded a profit for the second successive year to the end of June 2014. Abramovich hasn't put the brakes on his own spending though, his $1bn super yacht a reminder of his vast personal wealth. There are many similarities between Abramovich and PSG's owners -- Qatar Sports Investments (QSI). It has vast reserves -- an estimated $200 billion -- and also craves a Champions League crown. It is being forced to curtail spending after being hit with a fine by UEFA for failing to meet the criteria set out by FFP. After QIS purchased 70% of the club in June 2011, and became the sole shareholder the following year, PSG was transformed into one of the world's richest clubs overnight. Like Abramovich, it invested heavily in the playing squad -- purchasing the likes of Javier Pastore and Ibrahimovic -- and was rewarded in 2013 with PSG's first league title for 19 years. Despite defending its French crown last season, success on the European scene continues to elude it. It has been knocked out at the last eight stage in the last two seasons, by Barcelona in 2012/13 and by Chelsea in 2013/14. Coach Laurent Blanc is presiding over an injury crisis at present but the tie with Chelsea could be the deciding factor as to whether he continues in his job beyond the end of the season. Who will be the key protagonists? Leaving aside the wealth of attacking options on display, there is one man who is certain to attract plenty of attention -- David Luiz. The Brazilian defender spent three years with Chelsea, and was part of the squad that won the Champions League in 2012, but turned down a new contract to join PSG for a fee of around $76 million. His defensive prowess was the focus of much attention in the Premier League, one pundit saying Luiz operated on the field as if he was being controlled by ""a 10-year-old on a PlayStation."" Prone to abandoning his defensive station and pouring forward when deployed at the back, Mourinho moved the 27-year-old into midfield for the majority of last season. This two-legged tie could go either way for the Brazilian: either Luiz proves his former club made a mistake in letting him go with a barnstorming performance, or those trademark lapses in concentration will confirm the belief that Chelsea pulled off an outstanding piece of business. Luiz will be tasked with shackling Diego Costa, Chelsea's new striker who has taken to the Premier League like a duck to water, scoring 17 goals already to help the Londoners carve out a seven-point lead over Manchester City. Cesc Fabregas is the man who supplies most of Costa's goals after joining from Barcelona in June, while Mourinho has stiffened Chelsea's resolve in defense, veteran skipper John Terry key to its parsimonious nature. As for PSG, after two years of outright dominance in France, it is stuttering this season. Even before a crippling injury crisis recently took hold, it had been criticized for under performing and currently sits third in the table, behind Marseille and Lyon. Sunday's draw with Caen was a case in point. Leading 2-0 at halftime it lost four players to injury and having run out of substitutes, its nine men couldn't prevent slumping to a 2-2 draw. Ibrahimovic is still its talisman, and his striker partner Ezequiel Lavezzi will also be important in the absence of so many players. It is hoped Blaise Matuidi will recover in time to feature against Chelsea, while Marco Veratti will have to take on extra responsibility given its depleted ranks. What happened last time they met? Quite simply, PSG should have won. It secured a 3-1 lead in the first leg at the Parc des Princes after goals from Pastore and Lavezzi were added to a by a Luiz own goal. Chelsea took the lead in the return leg through Andre Schurrle -- recently sold to German club Wolfsburg -- but were struggling to conjure any chances as the game entered its final moments. But substitute Demba Ba popped up to bundle the ball home in the 87th minute to spark wild scenes of celebration at Stamford Bridge and send Mourinho sprinting down the touchline to pass on some tactical instructions in the aftermath. Chelsea would fall at the next stage, beaten 3-1 on aggregate by Spanish champions Atletico Madrid, which succumbed to city rivals Real in the final. This is Mourinho's fifth attempt at securing the Champions League crown for Chelsea, but will he succeed this year?","Chelsea meets Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League last 16 on Tuesday .

"When Al Jazeera becomes a major U.S. cable channel, as it plans, some Americans are likely to click past it, recalling the alleged anti-American tone by the pan-Arab network during the Iraq war a decade ago. ""My guess is that when people hear about Al Jazeera, they will not be paying attention to the news quality or correspondents,"" said media analyst Stuart Fischoff, a retired professor at California State University at Los Angeles. ""They will just hear Qatar, and say it's an Arab country and it's full of terrorists and ... therefore bias in the news,"" he said. The Qatari government owns Al Jazeera. Others, however, may find any past political slants overshadowed by a newscast striving toward U.S. standards. Viewers may be curious just to hear Al Jazeera America, which will have access to millions of U.S. homes now that the traditional Arabic-language network this week acquired Current TV, once owned by former U.S. Vice President Al Gore and others. ""I think it's a very, very well-done news network,"" said media expert and former White House correspondent Porter Bibb of Mediatech Capital Partners in New York, where he listens to a related network, Al Jazeera English, now available in a tiny fraction of U.S. markets. Al Jazeera English also is live-streamed at no cost online and provides insight into what the bigger, new Al Jazeera America will look like, he said. The emergence of Al Jazeera as a major U.S. cable network has resurrected debate about past accusations of anti-American bias during the Iraq invasion under President George W. Bush. The Bush administration excoriated the Arab peninsula's network for broadcasting Osama bin Laden videos. Today, evidence of U.S. antipathy at the Arabic network has dissipated significantly, though not entirely, several analysts say. ""It has obviously been demonized by our politicians for almost a decade,"" said Rory O'Connor, a former CBS News producer and a media expert. He noted how an Al Jazeera cameraman was detained for six years at the U.S. Navy prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. But Al Jazeera's current English broadcast is ""excellent,"" without the bias alleged by U.S. politicians, said O'Connor, author of the roryoconnor.org blog and a contributor to Al Jazeera's website. He disputed conservatives' portrayal of Al Jazeera as a ""terror network"" and propaganda outlet. Other analysts, however, say Al Jazeera continues to telecast content that they deem to be anti-American. ""Surely they will be careful in the beginning. They will try to prove that they are a professional channel that's objective,"" said Yigal Carmon, president of the Middle East Media Research Institute, which has gathered several Al Jazeera video clips in recent years that the institute says show anti-American bias. Carmon is a former chief counterterrorism adviser to Israeli Prime Ministers Yitzhak Rabin and Yitzhak Shamir. ""It's much less anti-American than in the past, and the English (broadcast) is a soft version"" of the Arabic telecast, Carmon continued. ""But this is the government of Qatar. It's to discuss the government of Qatar. It's a policy arm of the ruler of Qatar."" Spokesmen for Al Jazeera couldn't be reached by CNN for comment. In language that will surely be open for debate once Al Jazeera America enters U.S. homes, Carmon used strong words in describing the Qatari government. ""Qatar, after all, is a dictatorship, and in a dictatorship, they use media as an arm of foreign policy, be it Arab or Muslim foreign policy or an international one,"" he said. The Qatari government's decision to bring Al Jazeera into American homes is a provocative political maneuver -- as well as an emerging business strategy now being pursued by other government-sponsored networks, experts said. ""Can I note the unusual nature or essential weirdness of a former vice president of the United States selling his network to an Arab-based network that is owned by a foreign government?"" said media expert Howard Kurtz, host of the weekly CNN program ""Reliable Sources."" Al Jazeera has always been regarded as something of a vanity venture by the wealthy emir of Qatar, which is home to the world's third largest gas reserve and is spending billions of dollars on its public image profile by sponsoring sports events at home and in Europe, experts said. ""Al Jazeera has been trying and failing for years to get on television here in the United States,"" media writer Brian Stelter of New York Times told CNN. ""For the most part, Al Jazeera is buying this for the real estate because it's beachfront real estate."" Bibb, of Mediatech Capital Partners, referred to how Al Jazeera reportedly paid $500 million to acquire Current TV, whose access to 60 million households is now expected to be largely transferred to Al Jazeera America. ""If you have bottomless pockets, it doesn't make any difference what you pay or how you go forward,"" Bibb said. ""I think the assumed price of $500 million is absurd for what they got. On the other hand, it makes no difference to the emir of Qatar because it's chump change to him."" But one cable company has balked at carrying Al Jazeera America: Time Warner Cable stopped carrying Current TV upon the announcement of the Al Jazeera deal. A Time Warner Cable spokeswoman said that past bias allegations against Al Jazeera didn't factor into the firm's decision. Analysts agreed, saying the company could be leveraging Al Jazeera America, seeking to get a per-subscriber payment for the cable firm in exchange for carrying the channel. ""This has nothing to do with politics. We treat Al Jazeera like any other network,"" said a Time Warner Cable spokeswoman. ""We will look to gauge our customer interest in Al Jazeera America and assess whether it is a good value for our customers."" Commentary: Why Al Jazeera has set its sites on the U.S. Al Jazeera America isn't an isolated phenomenon. Another government-sponsored media outlet that has ventured into U.S. broadcasting is China's CCTV America, launched last year. ""The Chinese have about a similar coverage of the U.S. media market as Al Jazeera does right now,"" Bibb said. ""They are using a soft diplomacy and no one is saying it's a propaganda outlet. Their approach is very thoughtful, but it's all China and that's what people are hungry for."" Bibb wondered why Al Jazeera America would plan to produce 60% of its content in the United States, as it has said, when Al Jazeera has increasingly become renowned for its coverage of the Middle East, especially during the recent Arab Spring revolutions. Politics aside, Al Jazeera America will find American audiences to be tough customers. The Arab royal-family-owned network will be entering a tumultuous, fragmented marketplace for news programming where the top-ranked cable news shows garner ratings only in the hundreds of thousands at any one time, not millions, analysts said. Furthermore, access to 60 million homes doesn't guarantee that many people will be watching the program, analysts said. International newscasts in particular can also be a hard sell, experts said. ""A lot will depend on how much appetite there is in the American market for international news. A lot of these organizations have cut back on that,"" Kurtz said. Carriers ""are getting hate mail from some viewers who don't want to see it on their cable lineup,"" the New York TImes' Stelter said about Al Jazeera. ""But money can change a lot of these problems and they have a lot of it.""","Media analysts say the past anti-American bias of Al Jazeera has largely subsided .
But one group collects Al Jazeera video clips that it says show bias .
The decision to bring Al Jazeera into American homes is a political maneuver, some say .
The new venture will find the cable news market competitive ."
"After five days of relentless cross-examination that left Oscar Pistorius quivering, sobbing and fumbling, the athlete's defense team now has a chance to discredit the prosecution by presenting its witnesses. During cross-examination, prosecutor Gerrie Nel accused the athlete of inconsistencies and contradictions in his testimony. His aim is to prove that Pistorius intentionally shot and killed his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, after a heated argument in the early hours of Valentine's Day last year. The defense team now gets its chance to cast doubt on that account and prove that the star sprinter shot his girlfriend through a closed bathroom door after mistaking her for an intruder. Defense attorney Barry Roux called forensics expert Roger Dixon, who disputed a conclusion by a pathologist on the cause of Steenkamp's back wounds. The pathologist said they were made by a bullet ricochet. Dixon said they were made by a magazine rack. The autopsy said they were made by a blunt, hard object. Nel took every opportunity to discredit Dixon, including questioning his ballistics evidence when he said none of the bullets missed Steenkamp, while the state expert had said one did. ""You see how irresponsible it is to make inferences in areas where you're not an expert?"" Nel told him. At one point, Judge Thokozile Masipa ordered the state prosecutor to be less aggressive in his questioning. Valentine's Day card . Pistorius has maintained he was terrified when he heard noises from the bathroom. When he entered the bathroom and heard a noise behind the closed toilet door, he pulled the trigger without thinking, believing an intruder was inside. And in an apparent bid to show their romance was not as rocky as portrayed by the prosecution, Pistorius on Tuesday read a card that Steenkamp had planned to give him on Valentine's Day. ""Roses are red, violets are blue, I think today is a good day to tell you that I love you,"" the message read. Last week, Pistorius, 27, took the stand for the first time since the trial started on March 3 to testify about what happened on the fateful day. During his cross-examination, the prosecution released details of his relationship with the model and law school graduate, which began in November 2012. It included text messages retrieved from their phones. Nel accused him of acting selfishly toward Steenkamp, picking on her and shunning a declaration of love that she sent via a phone message. The court also heard audio recordings Dixon had made of a cricket bat striking a door similar to the one in Pistorius' toilet, and of gunshots fired through the door. Prosecution witnesses have testified to hearing a woman scream, followed by gun shots, but the defense disputes their testimony, saying the only scream came from Pistorius after he had fired the fatal shots. The trial was later adjourned for the day. Gripping trial . If Pistorius is found guilty of premeditated murder, he faces 25 years to life in prison. The defense team will call 14 to 17 witnesses, Roux said when he opened his case. The trial is scheduled to continue until the middle of May. Masipa will decide the verdict in collaboration with two experts called assessors. South Africa does not have jury trials. The trial has gripped South Africa and sports fans worldwide who considered Pistorius a symbol of triumph over physical adversity. His disabled lower legs were amputated when he was a baby, but he went on to achieve global fame as the ""Blade Runner,"" winning numerous Paralympic gold medals on the steel blades fitted to his prostheses. Only those in the courtroom saw Pistorius on the stand, because he chose not to testify on camera. His testimony could be heard in an audio feed. The trial will be postponed until May 5 after Thursday's session per the state's request, the judge said.","After Thursday's session, the trial will be postponed until May 5 .

"More than a dozen cases of Enterovirus D68 have been confirmed in New York state, according to officials. ""EV-D68 is causing cases of severe respiratory illness ... sometimes resulting in hospitalization, especially among children with asthma,"" the NYS Department of Health said in a statement Friday. Enteroviruses are quite common in September; the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 10 to 15 million people are infected by these viruses each year. But doctors believe this particular type of enterovirus, Enterovirus D68, is causing more serious problems than others have in years past. As of September 11,  more than 80 cases in six other states -- Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky and Missouri -- have been confirmed to be EV-D68, according to the CDC. New York is the first state in the Northeast with confirmed cases. On Thursday, media reports of kids flooding ERs in Alabama and Washington state spoke to the spread of the virus. Other states, including Michigan, Georgia, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Utah, are also investigating clusters of respiratory illnesses. Several have sent samples to the CDC for testing. New York sent additional samples from patients with severe respiratory illness to the CDC for confirmation of Enterovirus D68. The virus is hard to track, as so many enteroviruses cause similar symptoms, and hospitals generally do not test for specific types. Enteroviruses usually present like the common cold; symptoms include sneezing, a runny nose and a cough. Most people recover without any treatment. But if your child appears to be having trouble breathing, take him or her to a doctor right away. ""It is important that we follow common sense rules to prevent the spread of this virus, as we do for flu and other contagious illnesses,"" said New York acting State Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker. ""Because there is no specific treatment or vaccination against this virus, our best defense is to prevent it by practicing proper hygiene.""

"Oscar Pistorius didn't consciously pull the trigger the night he shot and killed his girlfriend, the sprinter testified at his murder trial Tuesday. The Olympic and Paralympic athlete said he was ""overcome with a sense of terror and vulnerability"" before he shot through a closed bathroom door last year, fearing an intruder was inside. Defense attorney Barry Roux asked his client what he meant when he referred to the shooting as an ""accident."" ""I mean the situation, and the situation as a whole, it wasn't meant to be,"" Pistorius said. The double amputee said he was terrified when he heard the sound of the toilet door opening. ""I didn't think about pulling the trigger. As soon as I heard the noise, before I could think, I pulled the trigger,"" he said. The testimony came after the prosecution ended five days of grueling cross-examination, which has seen the athlete break down on several occasions. Valentine's Day card . Pistorius cried and his voice trembled as prosecutor Gerrie Nel challenged his account of what happened the night he shot and killed his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp. Nel asked who should be blamed for shooting his girlfriend on Valentine's Day 2013. ""I'm not sure, my lady,"" Pistorius said, directing his answer to the judge. He repeatedly said he feared for his life and thought there was an intruder in his bathroom. A day earlier, Pistorius testified, ""I blame myself for taking Reeva's life."" He became emotional as he described finding his girlfriend slumped over by a toilet after shooting her through a closed bathroom door. ""I was saying, 'Baby hold on. Jesus, please help me,' "" he said Tuesday. Nel has accused Pistorius of ""tailoring"" his version of events to suit his story. He questioned Pistorius on details after the shooting that the athlete said he doesn't remember, such as what exactly he did with the gun immediately afterward and who connected his cell phone to a charger in the kitchen. The prosecution contends that Pistorius shot Steenkamp intentionally after a heated argument, which Pistorius has repeatedly denied. The defense ended its re-examination of Pistorius by giving the court a piece of evidence: the Valentine's Day card that Steenkamp wrote to Pistorius. Pistorius read the card aloud. ""Roses are red, violets are blue,"" he read, his voice cracking. ""I think today is a good day to tell you that I love you."" Gripping trial . The defense called expert Roger Dixon as its next witness to take the stand at the Pretoria court. The forensic geologist was brought into the case to analyze the lighting conditions in Pistorius' home, specifically the main bedroom and connected bathroom. The defense team will call 14 to 17 witnesses, Roux said when he opened his case. The trial is scheduled to continue until the middle of May. Judge Thokozile Masipa will decide the verdict in collaboration with two experts called assessors. South Africa does not have jury trials.

"The trial of Oscar Pistorius, accused of killing his former girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, was postponed until April 7 because one of two assessors was hospitalized. The assessors will help the judge decide the verdict. South Africa does not have jury trials. Pistorius killed Steenkamp on Valentine's Day last year. Of that, there is no doubt. But was it murder? One of South Africa's toughest prosecutors, Gerrie Nel, has been fighting for most of this month to prove it was. On Friday, one of the country's shrewdest defense lawyers, Barry Roux, was scheduled to begin convincing a judge that it wasn't. Now he will have to wait. The verdict will hinge on two questions: . Did the Olympic sprinter know his girlfriend was behind the door in the bathroom of his house when he fired four hollow-point bullets through it in the middle of the night? And if he did not -- if he thought she was a burglar, as he insists -- did he act as a reasonable person would have? Critical testimony will come from the only living person who was in the house at the time, the ""Blade Runner"" himself. Pistorius was expected to take the stand for the first time Friday to give his side of a story he's been telling for more than a year. He woke up in the middle of the night, went to his balcony to bring in a fan -- or two fans, in his most recent version -- heard his bathroom window opening, took his gun, went to the bathroom and fired through the door when he heard a noise in the toilet. ""It was pitch dark in the bedroom, and I thought Reeva was in bed,"" he testified when he applied for bail in the days after the killing. In that version of the story, Pistorius emphasized that he ""felt a sense of terror"" when he heard the noise, that he ""felt extremely vulnerable"" because he was not wearing his prosthetic legs, and that he ""has been a victim of violence and of burglaries before."" And, he said, ""We were deeply in love and I could not be happier."" If Judge Thokozile Matilda Masipa believes that story, Pistorius could be acquitted of murder. She could find him guilty of the lesser charge of culpable homicide -- similar to what would be called manslaughter in the United States -- or find him not guilty at all. The defense is likely to rely on three types of experts to support Pistorius' story: . Ballistics . Pistorius fired four shots. Three hit Steenkamp: one in the hip, one in the arm and one in the head. The shot to the head probably killed her almost instantly. But when did that shot hit her? The prosecution says it hit her last. That means she would have been able to scream between shots -- potentially giving Pistorius a moment to realize his mistake and stop shooting. Defense lawyer Barry Roux rejected the prosecution's order of shots, though, in a heated exchange with police Capt. Christian Mangena, the prosecution ballistics expert. Roux said the defense ballistics expert would show that the order of shots was different, and that Pistorius fired the four shots in two quick bursts -- two ""double taps."" Mangena said it was ""impossible"" for the pattern of wounds on the body to be the result of two double taps, ultimately leaving Roux sighing dismissively and promising that his own ballistics expert would explain. Pathology . Oscar Pistorius threw up repeatedly as Gert Saayman, who performed the autopsy on Steenkamp, described the devastating wounds Pistorius inflicted on her. But as gruesome as the testimony was, it is not critical to the state's case -- there's no doubt, after all, who killed Steenkamp or how. The most damning thing Saayman said was far less dramatic. Based on the contents of her stomach, the pathologist suggested that Steenkamp had probably eaten around 1 a.m., about two hours before she died. That's a direct contradiction of Pistorius' story that they were in the bedroom by about 10 p.m., her doing yoga and him watching television, and that they went to sleep after she finished her yoga. Roux hammered Saayman on the question of when Steenkamp last ate, going so far as to bring in academic articles for the pathologist to read, a clear sign that the defense considers it crucial to rebut that point. Saayman did not budge. A pathologist who attended the autopsy on behalf of Pistorius, Reggie Perumal, is due to testify for the defense. A police cell phone expert also may have found a similar inconsistency with Pistorius' timeline. Capt. Francois Moller, who downloaded the contents of Pistorius' iPhone, said it made an Internet connection for about five minutes an hour and 20 minutes before the shooting. The defense may put forward an expert of their own to explain. Psychiatry . Pistorius needs the judge to believe not only that there is a chance he made a genuine mistake in thinking Steenkamp was a burglar, but that his response was reasonable. Sean Rens, a gun dealer who was selling a small arsenal to Pistorius at the time of the killing, testified that the athlete had passed a test showing he knew what the law said about firing in self-defense. On the face of it, what Pistorius did in firing through a closed door, when he could not see an imminent threat, was neither legal nor safe, the Rens testimony suggested. But a psychiatrist may argue that Pistorius should be judged by a different standard of reasonableness because he is a double amputee who was not wearing his prosthetics at the time. His statement at his bail hearing implied that he should: ""As I did not have my prosthetic legs on and felt extremely vulnerable, I knew I had to protect Reeva and myself. ... I felt trapped as my bedroom door was locked and I have limited mobility on my stumps."" If the judge accepts that as true, Oscar Pistorius' disability could prove to be his greatest defense.","The defense tries to convince a judge that Reeva Steenkamp's death wasn't murder .

And if he did not, did he act as a reasonable person would have?

"Standing by a poster depicting in full detail the complex union of muscles that make up the human body, David Sengeh works on a custom-made prosthetic leg inside MIT's Media Lab. Here, he has come up with a technology that could change the whole field of bionics, and improve the lives of amputees the world over. As a doctorate student in the Biomechatronics Group, which looks at how technology can be used to enhance human physical capability, Sengeh has taken on the challenge to design the perfect fit for every prosthetic socket -- the interface between the body and the prosthetic limb, and a major source of discomfort for amputees. Sengeh has found a way to load MRI scans of a patient's limbs onto a multilayer 3D computer to customize the socket design -- a development that could have a huge impact. ""I think it will change the whole industry,"" says Sengeh, who is from Sierra Leone. ""You just send us a minimum set of data and we will ship you a comfortable prosthetic socket,"" he adds. ""We are getting images, we are getting data that quantifies your body's impedance, stiffness, how stiff each point is, and we can use that with the surface information that we have, and modeling that we do, to create you a perfect shape and a multi-material impedance prosthetic socket."" Read this: Innovation saving lives . Legacy of war . His interest in improving the lives of amputees stems from his childhood in war-torn Sierra Leone. From 1991 to 2002, the country was caught in the grip of a vicious war that took thousands of lives. One of the most common atrocities committed during the war was to hack off people's limbs, scarring them for life both physically and psychologically. ""Seeing people who had lost their limbs and whose lives were just kind of cut short was very, very traumatizing,"" says Sengeh, who is from Bo, the West African country's second biggest city. ""But it also opened this desire to engineer a solution."" Read this: 'Shooting became just like drinking a glass of water' But the horrors of war didn't prevent Sengeh from thinking big. His intellectual prowess was evident from a young age as he got one of the highest scores for a standardized test in Sierra Leone. In 2004, he won a scholarship to study in Norway. Next, he got into Harvard to study at its School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, before joining MIT's Media Lab. Yet the lasting legacy of Sierra Leone's war has followed Sengeh all the way to the United States, shaping his innovative work to this day. He had realized early on that many amputees in Sierra Leone opted not to use any prostheses because of the discomfort they were causing them. ""It doesn't matter if somebody gives you a pair of shoes that are worth $200 dollars -- if they're two sizes too small for you, you will not wear it; you will rather walk bare feet,"" says Sengeh. ""This is the same thing -- the prostheses were absolutely uncomfortable for them and it doesn't matter whether it was free or not, they would not wear it."" Sengeh now hopes that the custom-fitted, comfortable and affordable sockets he's designing at MIT will be on the market within five years. Fostering innovation . But Sengeh is not only coming up with new creations that can impact lives and change industry. Whilst studying at Harvard he created his first NGO, called Global Minimum, a group encouraging Africans to solve their own problems, starting with malaria in Sierra Leone. Read this: From war orphan to teen ballerina . And in March last year, he launched Innovate Salone, a mentoring initiative aiming to inspire innovation and self-sufficiency in his native country. Innovate Salone uses a competition to fund education programs in Sierra Leone, covering everything from electronics to farming. One of the young students Sengeh mentors through this initiative is Kelvin Doe, a 15-year-old boy who created a radio station from scrap materials and discarded electronics. Sengeh brought Doe to present his inventions at MIT, making him the youngest ever person to be invited to MIT's Visiting Practitioners Program. Read this: DIY Africa - Empowering a new Sierra Leone . And Sengeh is now spreading his concept, branching out to find other young innovators across Africa. ""We do have the talent and young people within Sierra Leone, within Africa as a whole, to invent the future,"" he says. ""We do not need primary aid, we do not need money, we do not need solutions and products to come from the West to be given to people and train them how to use it. ""That is not how you develop an economy -- the creative thinking, the ability to dare to dream and take the risk to develop a prototype. Those are what's instrumental. Those are what's needed to develop products that will change the world. That is what changes a country.""","David Sengeh, 26, is working to enhance the lives of amputees .

"Tosca Reno is defying the odds. At 53, the author and fitness expert refuses to subscribe to the stereotypes that accompany her age. Instead, she is changing them.  And, in the process, she's encouraging others to change their lives. Reno, the author of 13 clean eating books, says the secret to being healthy and happy is eating clean. Her popular ""Eat-Clean Diet"" encourages individuals to drink plenty of water and eat six small meals daily, including a combination of lean protein and complex carbohydrates. Put simply, clean eating is avoiding all processed food, relying on fresh fruits, vegetables and whole grains rather than prepackaged or fast food. ""It may sound counterintuitive, but eating clean allows you to eat more and weigh less because you are making smart food choices,"" Reno said. ""I sometimes get criticized for using the word 'diet,' but the Eat-Clean Diet really is a lifestyle change that leads to healthy, steady weight loss and healthy eating for life."" Reno's advice to those wanting to change their lives is to first realize there is another way to live. ""This could come in the form of that 'a-ha' moment, when you suddenly catch a glimpse of your lumpy reflection in a store window, or perhaps after you receive some bad news at the doctor's office,"" she said. ""You just need that opening, that moment, when you finally decide to give yourself permission to change."" Reno's own ""a-ha moment"" came at 40. Unhealthy and in an unhappy marriage, she realized she must make changes. After divorcing her first husband, she began to see life differently. ""That was when I began seeing the world as having possibilities instead of limitations,"" she said. Processed food linked to lower kids' IQs . At the time, Reno was overweight and was battling heart problems and hypoglycemia. She began going to the gym and decided to go back to school, where she met fitness guru Robert Kennedy, whom she later married. ""I didn't know who he was, but he said, 'Listen, I can get you into shape.' I soon learned who Robert was -- an icon,"" she said. Kennedy, recipient of the 2012 Arnold Sports Festival Lifetime Achievement Award, became highly regarded in the fitness industry after founding Robert Kennedy Publishing, which has published 53 books and produces six fitness magazines. Kennedy taught Reno how to eat healthily and work out, and Reno began seeing results. ""My physique changed. Everyone started asking questions ... I felt l was owning a secret -- that it is 80% nutrition, 10% training and 10% genetics."" Reno revealed her healthy secrets in her first book, ""The Eat-Clean Diet."" Since then, she has developed a large following of readers. However, all the success in the world could not have prepared Reno for this past spring, when she lost Kennedy, her biggest champion, to lung cancer. She said eating clean has helped her manage her grief and maintain her strength. ""I have abundant energy. My emotional energy is strong,"" she said. ""I feel like when you have the nutritional army at work inside of you, you are that much more able to ward off depression."" Reno said she is determined to make her late husband proud. In addition to taking the reins at Robert Kennedy Publishing, she will compete in a figure competition October 13 in his honor. In the competition, Reno will be judged on leanness, muscularity, muscle symmetry, evidence of athleticism, poise, grace and confidence. She said her late husband is providing her with all the confidence she needs. ""His teachings are guiding me through this,"" she said. Each day, Reno goes to the gym, which she calls her ""drug of choice,"" and does ""reps for Bob."" ""I'm rebuilding myself,"" she said. Reno advises all who begin the Eat-Clean Diet have a clear purpose in mind to power them through the process. ""Anything new is challenging or different,"" she said. ""But it becomes second nature very quickly."" She advises dieters to envision the end result, just like one would envision arriving at a travel destination. ""I think you have to have your mind set in place,"" she said. ""What does the end result look like?"" Doctors write a prescription for fresh produce . Once a goal is determined, Reno said individuals must prepare their surroundings to support that goal. ""Clear your cupboards of all junk foods and then start planning healthy meals and shopping for clean food,"" she said. Reno's books contain meal plans, grocery lists, recipes and motivational tips to help. Always having clean food available is key, Reno said. ""When you're cooking dinner, double the recipe and pack the extra food for the next day's meals -- I call these 'planned leftovers,' "" she said. ""This will make it super easy to just grab a healthy meal when you're pressed for time. Also, when you leave the house, make sure you take a cooler filled with your healthy meals for the day."" Reno suggests setting weekly and monthly goals and writing them down. ""People who write down their goals are 50% more likely to succeed."" Whether easing into the Eat-Clean Diet or diving head first into it, Reno said it's important for dieters to be committed to the process. ""You're never going to get to your goals unless you're willing to do what you need to do to get there,"" she said. The most important way to achieve those goals is to manage time properly, Reno said. ""Plan your meals and training sessions for the week and try to delegate chores whenever possible. Once you get into a routine, you'll realize that the whole process is not as hard as you imagined.""","Tosca Reno champions a clean eating lifestyle .

"(CNN) -- Jacqueline Woodson's big win at the National Book Awards on Wednesday was briefly eclipsed by a racially charged joke. After Woodson accepted an award for her memoir ""Brown Girl Dreaming,"" host Daniel Handler shared an anecdote he learned over the summer: that Woodson, who is black, is allergic to watermelon. ""Just let that sink in your mind,"" said Handler, who writes popular children's books under the pen name Lemony Snicket. The non sequitur elicited a few laughs and uncomfortable titters from the audience. Handler went on to say that he advised Woodson to write a book that featured a black girl with a watermelon allergy. Watermelon is historically evoked as a favorite food among black people in racist jokes, and it's considered by many to be an offensive reference. Handler said that Woodson, who won the National Book Award for Young People's Literature, told him he should write the book instead. ""I'm only writing a book about a black girl who is allergic to watermelon if I get a blurb from you, Cornell West, Toni Morrison, and Barack Obama saying this guy's OK,"" Handler said, with a laugh. After a clip from the awards ceremony was posed on C-SPAN, viewers and some prominent writers quickly took to Twitter to denounce Handler's comments as racist and a distraction from Woodson's accomplishment. Handler responded with several apologetic tweets, including: ""My remarks on Wednesday night at #NBAwards were monstrously inappropriate and yes, racist."" Handler also pledged to donate $10,000 to the We Need Diverse Books campaign and match others' donations for 24 hours up to $100,000. Woodson's post-ceremony social media posts have expressed her happiness about the award and have not mentioned Handler's joke. The author did not respond to a request for comment on the incident. Other 2014 National Book Award winners included: .

"Video of a tourist plunging into the Zambezi River after her bungee cord snapped on New Year's Eve is enough to make anyone think twice before leaping from the Victoria Falls Bridge. But anyone planning a visit to Victoria Falls will be relieved to know it's not just about bungee jumping. Often listed as one of the seven natural wonders of the world, the falls and their surrounding gorges are a truly awe-inspiring sight. They were named after the British Queen in 1855 by Scottish explorer David Livingstone, but their local name of ""Mosi-oa-Tunya"" -- meaning ""the smoke that thunders""-- is far more descriptive. The roar of the Zambezi tumbling from the falls is indeed thunderous, and the thick spray that swirls like smoke around the cascade can be seen for miles. The falls straddle the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe, in the heart of two national parks -- the Mosi-oa-Tunya park on the Zambian side and the Victoria Falls park in Zimbabwe, which collectively form a UNESCO World Heritage Site. At 1.7 kilometers wide and up to 100 meters high they are not be the tallest or widest falls in the world, but many consider them to be the most spectacular. Discovering the real Zambia . Some connoisseurs argue they are best see seen from the Zimbabwean side, others say from Zambia, but in truth if you visit at the right time both sides offer a mind-blowing view. When to go . To see them at their most impressive you should visit when the Zambezi is in full flow, usually in February or March. At this time, they form the largest curtain of falling water in the world, with more than 500 million liters of water spilling over the falls each minute. Visit in November and you'll see the falls at their most tame, with barely a 50th of that amount flowing through. What to do . Even if you don't fancy a bungee jump, there's plenty to give adrenaline junkies their fix. The falls churn up torrents of raging white water, and where there's white water, there's white water rafting. Among the many outfits offering rafting thrills the Zambezi Safari and Travel Company is one of the best, offering one-day experiences from $135. A more sedate aquatic experience can be had in a canoe or, for those who prefer not to rely on muscle power, on a river cruise along the Zambezi. For the more culturally inclined, the town of Livingstone, some 10 kilometers from the falls, is the place to go. The colonial capital of Zambia (then Northern Rhodesia) until 1935, it's home to the Livingstone Museum, dedicated to the 19th-century explorer. It preserves a variety of Livingstone memorabilia, including his letters and medicine box, and has an exhibit on Zambian history. How Mozambique turned from war zone to tourist hotspot . Best Views . A truly vertigo-inducing experience can be had standing in the spray on ""Knife Edge"" bridge and daring yourself to look down at the seething waters below. But you can trump that by taking at dip in ""Devil's Pool,"" a natural rock pool high above the Zambezi, where you can swim to the very edge of the falls and peer over. The most dramatic views of the falls and the gorges can be had by hovering directly above them in a helicopter or microlight. For a short nostalgia trip, why not take a steam train ride across the historic Victoria Falls Bridge. Congo's erupting volcano boosts tourism . Wildlife . Around the falls a fragile forest ecosystem thrives on the high humidity created by the spray from the falls. Both national parks offer great opportunities for wildlife watching. Elephants, zebras, giraffes and hippos can all be found in the area, as can leopards, baboons and buffalo. You can take a safari on the back of an elephant, or alternatively, a number of tour groups offer lion encounters that let tourists walk with captive-bred lions. There are also birding safaris that offer glimpses black eagles, peregrine falcons and taita falcons soaring among the gorges. Where to stay . There is a wide range of accommodation in the area, from the cheap and cheerful to the expensive and extravagant. In Livingstone, hostel Fawlty Towers, named after a British sitcom, has a large garden shaded by sprawling mango trees. It offers camping facilities, private rooms and dorm beds that start at $10. Facilities include a swimming pool, lively bar and wi-fi. At the other end of the spectrum the Royal Livingstone provides five-star luxury right on the banks of the Zambezi. Consisting of 17 colonial-style buildings, it's within walking distance from the falls themselves. Rooms start from $700. A little further away, and priced somewhere between the two, the boutique Stanley and Livingstone has suites from $245 per person, and is situated on a private reserve bordering the Zambezi National Park in Zimbabwe.","Victoria Falls isn't just about bungee jumping -- it offers rafting, wildlife and river trips .

"After spending hours on Pinterest, combing through scores of gorgeous decor photos, do you ever look at your kitchen and hear the ""Wah, wah, waaaaaaah"" of a sad trombone? Kitchens don't work like other rooms, say decorators, and it's not always obvious how to decorate them. Instead of four blank walls to adorn, there are cabinet doors, appliances and counter tops, which can leave you feeling a little boxed in. ""When we purchased our home we were stuck with a lot of light maple cabinets. Good storage, yes, but all I saw were square lines,"" said Holly Modica, the decorating blogger behind ""House by Holly."" One way to deal with a grid of cabinet doors is a rigorous renovation, but not everyone has the budget for knocking down walls or installing custom cabinetry. Modica took a minimizing approach to her kitchen. ""The focus became how to soften the cabinets and add texture,"" she said. She collected soup tureens, baskets and weathered furniture from tag sales, made burlap shades for her chandelier and replaced only the backsplash. ""Now I barely notice the cabinets I once loathed,"" she said, because now the kitchen is stocked with decorative items she enjoys seeing every day. ""You have to look at decorating your kitchen in a different way,"" said ""Chic on a Shoestring"" decorator Kate Connor. ""It's not harder, just different. The color of your cabinets, the hardware of the cabinets, your backsplash and countertops all make up the decor in your kitchen, whether you like them or not."" ""People don't think of these things as decor, but they set the tone of the whole room. If they are outdated it can be difficult to decorate around them,"" she said. Simple paint created Layla Palmer's favorite kitchen feature, two-toned cabinets. She applied mourning dove gray paint to the bottom cabinets of the kitchen in her last home, and alabaster white to the top. She also employed chalkboard paint and a painted beadboard backsplash to create the cottage look she loves. ""We made inexpensive cosmetic changes and all of them are easy to change if the new homeowner ever decides to do so,"" she said, like adding pine boards and crown molding to make their off-the-shelf cabinets look taller. And who's to say you have to keep the cabinet doors as is? ""Sometimes people hesitate using glass doors on cabinets because they want to hide all their mess or they don't know how to beautifully style them with just simple stemware,"" said decorator Rina Norwood of Cornelius, North Carolina. Modica, too, uses open cabinets as part of her decor scheme. ""I like to display my pretty things, but keep my countertops clear,"" she said. The builder-basic kitchens found in many homes can be a source of design frustration. The solution, say decorators, is to think ""timeless"" when approaching the most noticeable aspects of the kitchen. ""I chose to stay within a very neutral zone, colorwise, to keep it from becoming outdated. Keeping the cabinets white with a black counter top gives our kitchen a very classic, timeless look,"" said Carmel Phillips of Lexington, Kentucky. Updating the hardware, too, can be an  inexpensive and effective update to plain old cabinets. ""There is something so timeless, classic, bright and elegant about a white kitchen,"" said ""Cuckoo 4 Design"" blogger Julia Konya. But you don't necessarily have to erase the dated features of the room. Sometimes, as in Sandra Kent's case, they can end up lending a very specific feeling to a kitchen. ""Cabinets say a lot of the time period,"" said Kent, from Dallas. ""My mother has adorable maple cabinets built in the '50s and I think they make the kitchen. Our home has solid oak from the '80s and I think it represents a period of stability."" However, when it comes to investing in the kitchen, the practical and decorative choice is countertops. ""The decor feature that stands out the most in our kitchen, and I would have to say in most kitchens, are the countertops. They are a splurge that was well worth it and they make a huge difference,"" said Konya. ""I first wanted to go with Carrara marble, but we are a very active family and I wanted something more durable. That's why I decided on highly durable and strong quartz."" Kitchens take a beating, and countertops, floors and appliances need to be strong enough to stand the test of countless dinners and holiday feasts. At the same time, there's got to be a cozy, comfortable feel in the room, because it's the place where family and guests are bound to congregate, said Connor. Aside from plenty of comfortable seating, she thinks lighting is key. ""People are afraid to use lamps in a kitchen, but they really can amp up the coziness of the room. A small lamp near the sink or under the cabinets adds a nice warmth to a room that you can't get from overhead,"" Connor said. She finds the lamps she put on the buffet table in her kitchen were an easy decorating opportunity that ratcheted up the comfort level. Are you obsessed with decorating your house?

"Just when you thought there were no more air-fare bargains left to be found online ... Customers cruising United Airlines' website for tickets on Thursday got a pleasant surprise. As reported by Forbes, air fares between cities such as Washington, DC and Minneapolis were being sold on the site for $0 to $10. Ticket prices on other domestic routes were displayed as $0, plus $5 tax. Word quickly spread around the Internet and savvy buyers scooped up untold numbers of the dream tickets before United spotted the error. The $0 fare and other wildly reduced fares appear to have been available for about 15 minutes, before United shut down its online reservations system, reporting that its site was undergoing maintenance. ""One of our filings today contained an error which resulted in certain fares being displayed as zero. We have corrected this error, "" said United in a statement that also blamed human error for the mistake. The site has since resumed normal operations. The tickets are sold, now what?

"Life isn't easy in Kibera, one of Africa's largest slums. About one million people live in this sprawling settlement in Nairobi, Kenya's capital, with limited access to electricity, running water and other basic infrastructure services. Getting by here demands a rugged resilience from Kibera's inhabitants -- a willingness to help their neighbors, and group together in times of need. But the everyday challenges of life here haven't been a barrier to local people expressing themselves. The slum is also home to the Kibera Film School, which gives local creative talent the opportunity to tell stories about their world to a broader audience. To understand their stories, you first have to understand the conditions they live in. Ronald Omondi, a Kibera resident and film-maker who captures the street life of these poor neighborhoods in his movies, has offered me a tour of the settlement to give an insight into some of the challenges faced here. Kibera began more than a century ago as an informal settlement in the forests outside Nairobi, where the British colonial authorities gave allocations of land to Sudanese Nubian soldiers returning from service with the King's African Rifles. From these small, forested plots, a vast settlement has sprung in an haphazard, unplanned way, leaving residents without access to fresh running water in their homes. ""The pipes that supply clean water to the slums are broken,"" says Omondi. Instead, the locals have rigged pipes to the city water supply. They collect water rations in containers wherever they can find it: From overflowing dams during the rainy season, as well as burst pipes. ""When pipes burst like this, some get (it) free and some are paying for it,"" says Omondi. Read also: Urban rebirth: Johannesburg shakes off crime-ridden past . A similar approach is taken to bring electricity into homes, with residents rigging up their own unofficial connections to city power lines to power their homes. Because the inhabitants of Kibera are among Nairobi's poorest, the goods in its markets are sold at very low price points. Cigarettes are sold singly, and most of the clothes for sale are second-hand: A pair of used jeans can be bought for about $2. Homes are built of a mixture of concrete, mud and wood, often by the labor of locals pitching in to help each other. There are no toilets inside. ""People come together because they like helping each other,"" says Omondi. ""Some decide to build a house because (there's) no employment around."" Some of those underemployed residents are finding an outlet through the Kibera Film School. The school was founded by American film-maker Nathan Collett, who came to Nairobi in 2006 to research African storytelling. In collaboration with locals, he made a short film, ""Kibera Kid,"" which went on to win a number of international awards. He subsequently launched a non-profit to start the Kibera Film School in 2009, with the aim of providing local people a chance to tell their stories through film, and gain the skills to work in the local film and television industries. Read also: Messi leads African literacy bid . Omondi once made a living selling CDs while he studied electrical installation at a local technical institute, before he heard about the opportunity to train at the school. ""I realized I have a lot of talent in camera work and filming, and that's when I applied,"" he said. Having discovered his passion for film-making, Omondi has made a number of projects -- documentaries about schools, commercials, and a feature film on the gangster scene. And today, he has returned to the school to teach photography. ""I feel like I want to use this talent to give back to the community,"" he says. Many other graduates have gone on to successful careers in the industry. ""They found the right way, and the right channel to follow,"" he said. ""Most of them are working in big companies with(in the) film production industries."" He said the school was ""transforming lives of people living in slums... How they think and want their thoughts to be seen visually."" As for him? ""I think it's changing my life,"" he said. ""I see big changes.""","Kibera, in Nairobi, Kenya is one of Africa's biggest urban slums .

"One day, many years from now, future generations will look back at this time in our country's history and wonder what in the hell were we thinking. The Kardashians are famous for no reason, same-sex marriage is controversial for stupid reasons, and somehow the ""Twilight"" franchise is a cash cow. But our culture's biggest sin may well be the auto-tuned syrup we've allowed to dominate the pop charts. All-time chart records are handed to vacuous acts such as the Black Eyed Peas and singing awards are given to vocal lightweights such as Taylor Swift. History will show a dark time in our culture in which a million followers on Twitter became a key component to winning a Grammy. But thank God for Pink. That's what I was thinking as I was watching her performance during Sunday's American Music Awards. She recreated the video for her current single, ""Try,"" a midtempo ballad about the ups and downs of an imperfect relationship. Where there is desire . There is gonna be a flame . Where there is a flame . Someone's bound to get burned . But just because it burns . Doesn't mean you're gonna die . You've gotta get up and try try try . Singing words like that live with the right level of emotion that Pink is known for is hard enough. Doing so while in engaged in an athletic pas de deux, complete with lifts, is breathtaking. She received a standing ovation afterward, much in the same way she commanded one at the 2010 Grammys as she swung over the audience's heads on a trapeze, asking: . Have you ever thrown a fist full of glitter in the air? Have you ever looked fear in the face and said, ""I just don't care""? It would all seem like a meat-dress wearing gimmick if she didn't have the voice and lyrics to back it up. But she does, and thus we can all breathe a sigh of relief knowing her voice will be there for future generations to discover when looking back at us. Pink won't be able to scrub our record clean singlehandedly -- there's just too much manufacturing for one person to overcome. But at least there will be evidence for my great-great grandkids to see that we weren't all ""American Idol's"" sheep. While Christina Aguilera has a tendency to oversing, Britney Spears can't sing, and Lauryn Hill sorta stopped singing, Pink has managed to carve a brilliant 13-year-career by being something that is incredibly rare these days -- an artist. A complete artist. Maybe the most underrated artist we've had on the radio in the past 20 years. That's not to suggest she's been ignored -- Pink has sold more than 40 million albums worldwide. It's just when you look at the amount of publicity given to her in comparison to say, Lady Gaga or Adele, well there is no comparison. We know she is phenomenal, but the others are considered phenomenons. Gaga and Adele are worthy of the accolades, but whenever I listen to Pink's ""Dear Mr. President,"" ""Family Portrait"" or ""Sober,"" I feel the need to atone for us not making more room for her in the pop culture paradigm. Billboard magazine -- one of the most respected names in the music industry -- ranked the top five performances from the American Music Awards. For them, Pink's brave rendition of ""Try"" was second. Tops was Psy doing ""Gangnam Style"" with MC Hammer. MC Hammer!?! Yes ... we're going to have a lot to answer for someday.","LZ Granderson: Why does our culture let auto-tuned syrup dominate the pop charts?

"(CNN) -- On September 11, 2001, the city of Melbourne, Australia evacuated its World Trade Center. This is a modest building on the banks of the Yarra River, a short distance from the city's central business district, a little over 10,000 miles from New York. It used to have a casino. Before that, it briefly hosted an exhibition of waxworks from Madam Tussaud's. If you ran a line from Ground Zero in Lower Manhattan through the center of the Earth, you would exit the planet not so far from here. Indeed, Australia is, simply, a long way from everywhere. A flight to Sydney takes 15 hours from Los Angeles, 21 hours from London, 14 hours from Johannesburg, and 10 hours from Tokyo. There is no stopping off in Australia on the way to somewhere else, unless you're headed to Antarctica. This isolation is at the heart of Australia's identity: It is the reason the country has an aboriginal population that existed undisturbed for 40,000 years, and some of the world's strangest and most inimitable flora and fauna. It is why the country was chosen to be a penal colony by the British in 1788. It is a place you go to be removed from the world. And yet on Monday, the world's eyes focused on Sydney, as a man with a gun took hostages in what he claimed was an attack on Australia by the Islamic State. A self-described cleric with a history of antagonism toward Australian military involvement in Afghanistan, reports suggest he was probably a dangerously deluded loner rather than a member of an organized terrorist group. But by the time the siege ended, two hostages were still dead. This wasn't Australia's first brush with terrorism. As I said, on 9/11, terrorists were attacking World Trade Centers, so Melbourne evacuated hers. And this didn't seem silly at the time -- that day made all horrors plausible. No precaution was too extreme when only the day before it had been inconceivable that terrorists might take thousands of lives in New York and across the United States. So for a while, Australia forgot it wasn't part of the world. ""We are all Americans,"" Australians said on 9/11 -- September 12, actually, on antipodean time, since Australia is so far away, it is usually a different day altogether. And we meant it: We were deeply shocked to see acts of foreign terrorism, always previously associated with unfamiliar people in unfamiliar places, happening somewhere ""Over There,"" become suddenly intimate and recognizable. Over time, however, as the War on Terror became the War on Iraq, and the American flags waved on TV, it became clear that although 9/11 affected the Western world, at its most pointed and personal, it was an American story. Australia, as usual, was watching from afar. We sent troops to Afghanistan and to Iraq, maintaining solidarity with our American cousins, but ultimately, we saw that the U.S. was ""Over There,"" too. In 2002, 88 Australians were killed by a radical Islamist group bombing on the Indonesian island of Bali, a popular holiday destination. Bali is a mere 6 hours from Sydney, and only 2Â½ from Darwin, the closest Australian city. It was a traumatic event, but again, it wasn't quite here. More recently, there were police terror sweeps in Australian cities, with arrests made and, apparently, plots foiled. The federal government warned us that groups had developed with the motivation and ability to carry out local attacks. You live a charmed life in Australia. The streets are safe, the weather is terrific, the people are friendly. The ocean keeps everything out. Or, at least, slows it down. We complain when a car costs $30,000 or a TV show won't hit our screens right away, but it's the distance that has allowed Australia to stay Australia in the face of relentless globalization. It's given us more than a decade in which to rethink our ideas on society and our way of life, and the trade-offs between freedom and security we're willing to make, without having to do so in the immediate aftermath of a national tragedy. If this hostage taker in Sydney had claimed to be acting for some other cause -- disgruntlement at the tax code, or the high price of cars -- we wouldn't call it terrorism. We would call it what it is: a lunatic with a gun. But that would overlook the deeper trend, which is that Australia's oceans are shrinking. Today technology allows a man to be more connected to militant extremists across the globe -- in spirit, if nothing else -- than he was to his neighbors in Bexley North. He can find and latch onto toxic ideas from the other side of the globe and bring them into Sydney. Whether we call it a siege or terrorism, it was something that used to happen Over There. And now it's here. It wasn't unexpected, and arrived more benignly than it could have, and today the country will get on with business as usual. But life is becoming a little less charmed. We are no longer so far away.","Max Barry: Sydney hostage incident brings home terrorism threat .

"Editor's note: Fareed Zakaria is an author and foreign affairs analyst who hosts ""Fareed Zakaria GPS"" on CNN on Sundays at 1 and 5 p.m. ET . Fareed Zakaria says Rwanda is Africa's biggest success story. NEW YORK (CNN) -- President Obama reached out to Africa earlier this week with a wide-ranging address praising the continent's steady achievements, but he called its persistent violent conflicts ""a millstone around Africa's neck."" ""Despite the progress that has been made -- and there has been considerable progress in parts of Africa -- we also know that much of that promise has yet to be fulfilled,"" Obama said in a speech to the Parliament of Ghana, a western African nation seen as a model of democracy and growth for the rest of the continent. Ghana, with a population of 24 million, was once a major slave trading center. Obama visited the Cape Coast Castle, a British outpost where slaves were held until shipped overseas, along with his daughters. CNN spoke to author and foreign affairs analyst Fareed Zakaria about Obama's trip and the status of Africa. CNN: ""When President Obama was in Africa last week, he visited Ghana, but you think there's another country that's a bigger and better success story?"" Fareed Zakaria: He was smart to focus on a success story, of sorts, like Ghana. But I would say the biggest success story out of the continent is Rwanda. You remember what happened in there just 15 years ago -- over a period of 100 days 800,000 men, women, and children were killed -- most of them slaughtered with knives, machetes, and axes by their neighbors. It is perhaps the most brutal genocide in modern history. By the time it ended, one tenth of the country's population was dead. Most people assumed that Rwanda was broken and, like Somalia, another country wracked by violence, would become a poster child for Africa's failed states. It's now a poster child for success. CNN: Meaning what? Zakaria: Well, the country has achieved stability, economic growth, and international integration. Average incomes have tripled; the health care system is good enough that the Gates Foundation cites them as a model, education levels are rising. The government is widely seen as one of the more efficient and honest ones in Africa. Fortune magazine published an article recently titled ""Why CEOs Love Rwanda."" CNN: Why has Rwanda succeeded when so many other African countries have failed? Zakaria: Much of it has to do with its president. President Kagame was the leader of the forces that came in and ended the genocide. He has led the country since then and implemented some controversial programs to help build stability in the country following the horrific events of 1994. He had to find a way to reintegrate the perpetrators of the brutal genocide into their original homes, often living next door to their previous victims. Rwanda is very unique in its post-conflict makeup. As the New Yorker writer, Phillip Gourevitch, points out, in Germany, the Jews left for America and Israel. In the Balkans the warring groups spilt up geographically. In Cambodia, the class that perpetrated the violence was easily identifiable and separated. In Rwanda, however, the killers and the victims live side-by-side, in every village and community. Can you imagine Nazis and Jews living next door to one another? CNN: So what did President Kagame do? Zakraia: The only way President Kagame could see to make peace was to reintegrate these communities. He came up with a specially crafted solution -- using local courts called Gacacas. In each village, the killers stood before their neighbors and confessed, and in turn were offered forgiveness -- part court, and part community council. It has made for a fascinating historical experiment that seems to be working. CNN: Can it really be working? How can killers be allowed to roam around the country free from prosecution? It doesn't seem fair. Zakaria: We have President Kagame on the show this week and I asked him that very question. It is obvious he has thought deeply on the issue and couldn't come up with any other option. As he states,  ""If we incarcerated everyone who committed a crime we wouldn't have a country."" ""There are many killers; there are hundreds of thousands because the genocide that took place in our country involved a huge percentage of our population, both in terms of those who were killed and those who killed. And if you went technically to try each one of them as the law may suggest, then you would lose out on rebuilding a nation."" CNN: But is the fact they've emerged from the genocide with some political stability enough to call the country a success? Zakaria: It might be fragile. Beneath the veneer of reconciliation, there might well be much hatred. And it might be that Kagame is holding it all together because of his personality and toughness -- perhaps like Tito in Yugoslavia. But he says his goal is to build institutions and have this process outlive him. Hope you will be able to watch the interview with him.","Zakaria: Rwanda is biggest success story out of Africa .

"The auction room -- standing room only -- broke into applause when the hammer finally went down. On sale was a tiny, white cup decorated with chickens, and the buyer was a prolific art collector from Shanghai, Liu Yiqian. At a price of HK$281.24 million ($36.05 million), it was a record sale for auction house Sotheby's -- the highest price reached for a Chinese porcelain artifact. The previous record, HK$252.6 million ($32.4 million), was reached in 2010 for a Qianlong period vase, also at a Sotheby's sale. ""Holy grail"" The 500-plus-year old Meiyintang Chenghua ""Chicken Cup,"" is one of a reported 17 existing worldwide, most of which reside in museums, with a small number -- like Liu's new acquisition -- in private hands. It is so-called because of the decoration painted on its surface, showing two roosters, and a chicken tending her chicks. ""About a hundred years after they were made, in the late Ming dynasty, they were already highly sought after by emperors,"" Nicolas Chow, deputy chairman of Sotheby's Asia and international head of Fine Chinese Ceramics and Works of Art, tells CNN. ""By the late 17th century they were considered the most expensive objects money could buy."" The record-breaking piece was the latest apogee in a spiraling global art auction market. The auction house describes it as ""arguably the most celebrated porcelain throughout the centuries."" The piece was fired in the imperial kiln during the 15th century. Liu will house the incredibly rare item, known in collectors' circles as the ""holy grail"" of Chinese ceramics,  in his private Long  Museum in Shanghai. Chinese money, Chinese art . Liu is one of China's ultra-wealthy with an estimated net worth of $900 million, a former taxi driver who made his fortune in finance. He has said he ""doesn't care"" about the price of the cup. Growing economic power from China, especially from super-rich Chinese collectors like Liu has contributed to Hong Kong's transformation into one of the world's auction hubs, and inflated prices around the globe. ""I think we're in a one-way elevator upwards in terms of prices for Chinese art,"" says Chow. ""I think there's no possible drop in the price of Chinese antiques."" However, given the significance of this sale and the rarity and fame of the piece in question, Chow believes that the record is safe for a while. ""Objects of this kind of rarity ... there aren't many of them so I can't see (this record being broken) for a few years."" Art or garbage? The sale does raise questions about the value of art in today's market, especially coming hot on the heels of the news that cleaners in a luxury Hong Kong hotel accidentally threw out a painting valued at almost HK$29 million ($3.7 million). The South China Morning Post reported that the Chinese ink wash painting, ""Snowy Mountain,"" part of an auction hosted by the Grand Hyatt hotel, was seen being dumped by cleaners on security footage. The garbage was taken to a Hong Kong landfill but attempts to recover the painting so far have remained fruitless.","A small ""Chicken Cup"" breaks the record for a Chinese porcelain artifact sold at auction .

"(CNN) -- Last year on World AIDS Day, President Barack Obama said that we can achieve an AIDS-free generation ""if we stay focused, and if we keep fighting,"" and challenged the world to ""come together to set new goals"" in the war against AIDS. Three decades into the epidemic, important headway has been made thanks to ambitious efforts by the U.S. government to end AIDS here and abroad. The National HIV/AIDS Strategy, released in 2010, is the nation's first comprehensive road map with clear and measurable targets to be achieved by 2015: reduce new HIV infections, increase access to care and improve health outcomes for people living with HIV and reduce HIV-related disparities. Over the past four years, it has prioritized funding where it will have the most impact. This World AIDS Day on December 1, marked today, we can point to successes in combating HIV in the United States. The overall number of Americans who know their HIV status increased to 84% approaching the Strategy goal of 90% by 2015. From 2008 to 2012, HIV diagnoses declined among blacks, Latinos and women nationally. The latest surveillance data show that new HIV infections have been declining among black women and injecting drug users. Importantly, AIDS diagnoses (or diagnosing people late in their disease progression) decreased among all racial and transmission groups during this time. The Affordable Care Act has enabled millions of uninsured Americans to have access to health care and get free HIV testing. The White House's HIV Care Continuum Initiative has boosted federal efforts to prevent and treat HIV. Meanwhile, a series of recent breakthroughs in HIV cure research have also brought us more clarity than we have ever had on the precise steps and tools needed to finally eradicate this disease. The federal government has prioritized cure research and amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research, recently upped the ante on cure research as well, setting a goal to invest $100 million in developing the scientific basis for a cure by 2020. Unfortunately, we still have work to do. About 50,000 Americans continue to become infected with HIV each year, with nearly 80% of infections among men and two-thirds of new infections nationally among gay and bisexual men. We continue to see high rates of new infections in the South, especially amongst African-Americans. Astoundingly, one third of all black gay men nationally are HIV-positive -- and they remain the population with the greatest number of infections in the black community and the only population in the black community in which new infections are increasing. Though HIV diagnoses decreased among injecting drug users from 2008 to 2012, AIDS-related deaths remain the highest in this population. And beyond our borders, we have also reached a turning point. According to the UNAIDS report that was released last week and the GAP report released in July 2014, we have five years to break the epidemic for good or risk it rebounding out of control. We have made many gains, but there is still much more work to do. The annual number of new HIV infections has dropped by 33% since 2001. And more people than ever are receiving lifesaving antiretroviral treatment, leading to historic declines in AIDS-related deaths worldwide. This progress is encouraging, but we have a chance to rid the world of the epidemic now. The United States must be a leader in this effort. The United States leads the world in its commitment to combating AIDS globally. American investments through the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund) as well as the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) have been transformative in the global response to AIDS. PEPFAR is helping provide lifesaving HIV treatment to 6.7 million people, and has prevented countless infections among infants born to HIV-positive moters in some of the hardest hit regions. Yet challenges remain. An estimated 35 million people worldwide are living with HIV, 19 million of them do not know they are infected, and more than 2 million become infected each year. HIV medications remain out of reach for far too many globally -- more than 20 million are unable to access treatment -- and budget cuts threaten the advances that we have made and the possibility of ending the AIDS epidemic by 2030. We have an obligation to sustain and increase our contributions to the global HIV effort, especially since the U.S. contribution to foreign aid (including HIV prevention and other efforts) is less than 1 of our total budget. Congress must do its part by providing level funding for PEPFAR and the Global Fund in fiscal year 2015, and increasing our contribution in subsequent years. Level funding for PEPFAR alone will allow an additional 272,000 people on treatment, keep an additional 17,000 infants from being born with HIV and avert an additional 62,000 AIDS-related deaths. Although we now have the tools and the knowledge needed to end the AIDS crisis, the looming question is will we? We believe that we can and we will. We must reject budget cuts that threaten to paralyze proven lifesaving HIV interventions. Evidence continues to show that the scale-up of treatment for people living with HIV not only saves lives, but also greatly reduces the chances of an HIV-positive person transmitting the virus to others. UNAIDS recently declared that, ""If the world does not rapidly scale-up [treatment] in the next five years, the epidemic will spring back with a higher rate of new HIV infections than today."" Momentum is on our side. Now is not the time to slow down our efforts, or be complacent in our attitudes toward a disease that has already claimed 40 million lives and continues to ravage families and economies around the globe. Our country has led on this issue domestically and globally. We must overcome our differences, combine our strengths and our resources and unite in our quest to finally end AIDS and ensure the health and prosperity of future generations.","Barbara Lee and Kenneth Cole: Big strides made in HIV/AIDS fight .

"As we all know, Thanksgiving isn't always the harmonious holiday it's sometimes made out to be. Stick a bunch of relatives together in the same house, add menu planning and alcohol, and things can get a little snippy.

"Chick-fil-A restaurants' philanthropic WinShape Foundation no longer funds the most controversial and politically charged anti-same-sex-marriage groups and has not since 2011, according to Campus Pride, a leading national LGBT campus organization. Campus Pride issued a statement Monday claiming that Chick-fil-A gave the organization's executive director, Shane Windmeyer, access to WinShape's 2011 ""990"" tax documents. He said they show that the nearly $6 million in outside grant funding ""focuses on youth, education, marriage enrichment and local communities"" and that in the list of the foundation's beneficiaries, ""the most divisive, anti-LGBT groups are no longer listed."" Among those groups were the Family Research Council, Eagle Forum and Exodus International. Windmeyer acknowledged that WinShape continues to fund groups that don't condone same-sex marriage based on biblical beliefs but says these groups, such as the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, don't operate with the same hard-nosed political agenda the other groups are known for. Chick-fil-A President Dan Cathy sparked controversy last July when he weighed in on same-sex marriage, telling The Baptist Press, ""We are very much supportive of the family -- the biblical definition of the family unit."" Read more: Chicken, with a side of politics . Gay rights groups were most incensed about the chain's financial support for what they called anti-gay groups. The ensuing debate included politicians from Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel to former GOP presidential candidate Rick Santorum. Some proponents of same-sex marriage called for a boycott of the chain, which had annual sales of more than $4.1 billion last year. It has more than 1,615 locations in 39 states and Washington, and they are closed on Sundays. Many who agreed with Cathy took the opportunity to share their beliefs on August 1, dubbed ""Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day"" by former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. Their purchase of chicken sandwiches and nuggets to show their support for the restaurant chain and its president brought the restaurant chain record sales. The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation then promoted a National Same-Sex Kiss Day at Chick-fil-A restaurants across the country on August 3. ""Students on college campuses have been concerned with the giving practices of Chick-fil-A for years,"" Windmeyer said. ""Those comments just added fuel to the fire."" Students protested on both sides of the issue, and some schools weighed the possibility of removing Chick fil-A from cafeterias and dining halls. However, Windmeyer says many people -- perhaps even himself -- did not take the opportunity to embrace the opportunity for civil discussion on the issue. ""There was a lot of divisiveness and hate on both sides,"" said Windmeyer. ""It was like the Chick-fil-A brand was a chicken sandwich with purpose."" What does free speech mean to you? Chick-fil-A debate strikes nerve . Windmeyer says Cathy called him August 10. He expected an argument, yelling, anger, maybe even a lawyer to jump on the line, but instead there was an hour-long private conversation. After months of conversations, e-mails and text messages, Windmeyer says, he has developed a personal relationship with Cathy, met his family and even attended the Chick-fil-A Bowl, a college football game on New Year's Eve. ""It is about opposing viewpoints, not opposing people,"" Windmeyer said. ""Dan cares about young people and was upset to hear how his company was being used to hurt LGBT students."" Campus Pride says that after Windmeyer and Cathy began to discuss their beliefs and points of view, it suspended a national college campaign against the restaurant in an ""effort to find common ground"" around the values of respect and dignity Chick fil-A published on its website. ""The Chick-fil-A controversy continues to impact the lives of LGBT students and provides an opportunity for every college campus to assess their LGBT institutional commitment,"" Windmeyer said. ""Administrators have a responsibility to ensure a safe learning environment and should recognize the toll of the controversy by committing resources and services to ensure LGBT students feel safe and welcome on campus."" Neither Chick-fil-A nor the WinShape Foundation returned calls seeking comment. According to its website, Chick-fil-A -- a privately held chicken restaurant chain -- has more than 1,615 locations in 39 states and Washington, D.C., with annual sales of over $4.1 billion in 2011. Opinion: The right way and the wrong way to protest Chick-fil-A . WinShape Foundation filed the tax forms on November 15, according to Campus Pride, and they are public information that will be released by the IRS when it deems fit.

"For a company that hasn't attended CES since 1992, Apple dominates the show. You can't walk more than a dozen feet here at the Las Vegas Convention Center without seeing an iGadget or iAccessory of some kind. Apple's overwhelming presence by proxy is impressive, and underscores the immense place the company occupies in the consumer electronics sector. Of the 3,000 or so exhibitors here at CES, nearly 500 reside in the iLounge pavilion, a section dedicated specifically to Apple-related products. And then there are the hundreds of audio, automotive, health, gaming, and accessory companies hawking iOS and Mac peripherals. There are more iPhone and iPad adaptors, docks and dongles than you could possibly imagine. Vendors are showing off iPad camera rigs, solar-powered Mac batteries and even an iPhone-connected plant sensor. And then there's the sea of bedazzled and bedecked iPhone and iPad cases. The biggest reason for this is, of course, Apple's dominating presence in the consumer electronic space. It's a lot easier for startups and established players alike to ride Apple's coattails than those of, say, Google or Microsoft. ""We know that Apple is doing well,"" said Howard Cheng, Just Mobile's director of operations. ""We know that it's better to make Apple products than anything else."" Another advantage to going down the iRoute is Apple's tight focus on a few products and form factors. It's far easier to tailor accessories to Apple than anyone else. ""Accessory makers can reach virtually the entire installed base of iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch owners with two products, determined by the connector,"" the 30 pin or Lightning, said Charles Govin, an industry analyst with Forrester. ""Similarly, a case maker must create many SKUs for the Android market, but essentially only three (iPhone 3G, 4, and 5) for the entire iPhone market."" The relative ease with which companies can develop peripherals for Apple is made all the more appealing by the fact Apple customers have proven themselves only too happy to shell out money to accessorize their iDevices. ""Apple owners have a demonstrated willingness to spend for accessories, cases, and other customizations,"" Govin said. ""Essentially, the potential return on investment is more promising for Apple-related products."" CES also shows just how willing people are to build on Apple's iconic ""i"" branding. There's iLounge, iBattz, iSkin, iConnectivity, iPort and even iCat all within a few feet of each other on the show floor. Spend five minutes walking the floor and it becomes clear there's no need for Apple to be here. Hundreds of companies are only too happy to carry Cupertino's banner. Apple's presence here has grown rapidly. In the three years since the iLounge Pavilion launched, the space has quadrupled to 120,000 square feet, all but taking over an entire hall and pushing the automotive industry into another space. But does anyone wish Apple were actually here? Not really. ""I don't care,"" said Raymond Meng, president of iSmartAlarm. His company is releasing an iPhone-controlled home alarm system, which Meng says was inspired by the burglary of Steve Jobs' house this summer. Meng said that it doesn't matter that Apple isn't at CES with a booth or keynote, because CES is already the most successful and popular show for companies like his. Cheng, from Just Mobile, agrees. ""At this point, I don't think Apple needs to be here,"" he said. ""They have their own events and that works for them."" Just Mobile already has eight products in the Apple Store and uses CES to expand into the international market and meet clients. As for meetings with Apple, ""We visit them at their campus,"" Cheng said. Of course, CES could be a much hotter destination if it had the hottest tech company involved. With Microsoft dropping out, CES is losing even more of its sizzle. But the CEA, the organization that puts on the show, says that Apple skipping out isn't a big deal. ""Apple is a CEA member. It's just there prerogative to not exhibit and they've found it more cost effective to host their own events,"" CEA spokeswoman Danielle Cassagnol said. ""They've never keynoted or exhibited at CES, so them not being here isn't really a loss for us."" That's not entirely true, since Apple did introduce the Newton at CES in 1992, but perhaps the CEA wants to forget this fact. But the fact remains that Apple and its products are the widely seen, and discussed, at CES. It's here, even if it isn't. ""They have employees that attend the show, so in that way, Apple sort of is here,"" Cassognal said. Follow: Wired's live coverage of CES .

"(CNN) -- Walking the red carpet is basically like walking a tightrope in front of your harshest critics, but Gabourey Sidibe has handled hers with class. The 30-year-old ""American Horror Story: Coven"" star received nasty tweets about her appearance after she arrived at the Golden Globe Awards on Sunday, with some viewers taking offense to her shimmering floor-length gown. The reactions ranged from sarcastic ""is she pregnant?"" tweets to demands for Sidibe's stylist to do better. ""Clearly Gabby's stylist doesn't like her and has no problem stealing her money,"" said one observer. ""I love Gabby Sidibe but she looked like the GLOBE at the Golden Globes,"" said another.

"Actor Shia LaBeouf has settled charges related to his summer meltdown on Broadway by agreeing to get more alcohol abuse treatment. LaBeouf appeared at a Manhattan court Wednesday to plead guilty to one count of disorderly conduct under a deal that drops his trespass and harassment charges. The sentence requires LaBeouf, who has been getting outpatient alcohol treatment since his arrest, to continue treatment for another three months. The disorderly conduct conviction will be withdrawn if he completes the treatment and does not get arrested in the next six months. The ""Transformers"" actor was initially arrested by New York police on June 26 ""for refusing to leave a theatrical performance when asked, for creating unreasonable noise and using obscene language outside of Studio 54, and for spitting at a police officer at the Midtown North police precinct,"" Assistant District Attorney Alyssa Russell said in court Wednesday. The criminal complaint said LaBeouf was sitting in the audience in a theater at Studio 54, watching a performance of ""Cabaret,"" when he yelled ""loudly at the actors onstage"" and refused to leave. As a police officer escorted the actor out of the theater, LaBeouf allegedly said, "" ""F--- you. This is f---ing bull---. Do you know my life? Do you know who the f--- I am? Do you know who I am,"" the complaint said. At the police precinct, the actor spat in the direction of the officer and cursed at him, according to prosecutors. ""We appreciate the thoughtfulness of the resolution by the district attorney's office,"" LaBeouf's attorney Robert Gage told CNN after the hearing. LaBeouf must return to court on November 12 to prove he has completed the alcohol treatment. Mel Gibson sympathizes with Shia LaBeouf . He rose to fame at age 14 as the star of the Disney series ""Even Stevens."" He has stayed busy with regular movie and TV roles, including starring in three ""Transformers"" films.

"A controversial referendum on Catalonia's future as part of Spain has again been put on hold by a court, just days before the planned vote on Sunday. Spain's Consitutional Court on Tuesday suspended -- for the second time since September -- a referendum on independence for Catalonia, the wealthy, restive region in northeast Spain whose capital is Barcelona. The court said in a statement that it again suspended the referendum while it considers an appeal from the Spanish government that challenged the independence vote as ""unconstitutional."" Hundreds of thousands of Catalans have demonstrated in recent years for an independence referendum, and they closely watched the recent independence vote in Scotland. Even after Scotland voted to remain a part of the United Kingdom, many Catalans said the key issue was being allowed to vote in Catalonia on independence. But the Spanish government insists that the constitution does not permit just one of Spain's 17 regions, such as Catalonia, to unilaterally break away. Catalonia represents about 20% of Spain's economy and already has broad home-rule powers, including its own parliament, police force and control over education and health. The region also has a long list of grievances with Madrid, including over taxation. The first showdown came in September, after the Catalan regional parliament approved a law allowing referendums, and then a decree by the Catalan president set November 9 as the date. The Spanish government appealed and the Constitutional Court accepted that for study, effectively suspending the vote. Next, the Catalan president said there would still be a referendum, but it would be less formal, so it would be permissible under the law. It would be called a ""consultation,"" and would be conducted by volunteers at polling places, instead of the usual electoral officials. The court has now suspended that as well. Yet preparations continue for holding some kind of vote on Sunday in Catalonia. Citizens groups which have pushed hard to hold the referendum, and which also favor independence, sent notifications on Tuesday to news media about where to pick up accreditations in Barcelona in order to follow the election results on Sunday night. Polls indicate that a majority of Catalans want to have a chance to vote. Some polls show that less than a majority would vote for independence, given the chance. But a survey last week by the Catalan government's polling center predicted a very close fight, with 49.4% saying they would vote to break away from Spain.","The court's decision is the second time the vote has been suspended .

"(CNN) -- School administrators at a suburban Philadelphia school district wrongly captured thousands of images of students using school-issued laptop computer cameras, according to a motion filed in a lawsuit involving one of those students. But school officials in the Lower Merion School District of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, deny their actions were illegal or inappropriate, although they have admitted that they failed to provide proper notification of their policy to parents and that there were ""a substantial number"" of photos recovered during their investigation. All students at the two high schools in the Lower Merion district have access to a laptop computer, which they are allowed to take home upon payment of an insurance fee in case the device is lost or damaged. The school district installed the LANrev webcam security system for use if the laptop is reported lost, missing or stolen. But Michael and Holly Robbins say the computer their son brought home was not lost or stolen, and their son was photographed more than 400 times, captured in the act of sleeping, text-messaging with friends and -- on one occasion in November -- handling some candies that a school administrator mistook for pills. An assistant principle called Blake Robbins into her office to confront him about the ""pills"" -- actually a fruit-flavored chewy candy with a capsule-like shape -- alerting the Robbinses to the webcam use on their son's laptop. They filed suit in February against the school district, its board of directors and the school superintendent. Attorney Mark Haltzman filed the new court papers Friday after sifting through thousands of documents provided by the school district as part of the case, accusing the district of ""spying"" on students. Henry Hockeimer, an attorney for the school district, referred CNN to a letter from board president David Ebby posted on the district's Web site for comment about Haltzman's motion. In the letter, to district parents and guardians, Ebby denied that any ""spying"" had taken place. ""While we deeply regret the mistakes and misguided actions that have led us to this situation, at this late stage of the investigation, we are not aware of any evidence that District employees used any LANrev webcam photographs or screenshots for such inappropriate purposes,"" he wrote. Ebby further said that the school district was ""committed to disclosing fully what happened, correcting our mistakes, and making sure that they do not happen again."" An investigation conducted by an outside counsel and a computer security expert should be complete ""in the next few weeks"" and the results would be released. He also said that parents of all students whose photographs were take by the webcams would have a chance to see the images and that ""the privacy of all students will be protected."" Haltzman, however, told CNN that he believes students were photographed in violation of the school district's policy that access to the webcams would only be granted if the computer were reported to be lost, stolen or missing. School officials knew, he said, where Blake Robbins' laptop was. Haltzman said the documents he received detail other times the webcams were used when computers were not reported lost, stolen or missing. But Charles Mandracchia, an attorney representing an administrator involved in the case, said cams were used to locate laptops that had not been returned on time at the end of the year or that should not have been taken home, for example, if the insurance fee was not paid. Blake Robbins, Mandracchia said, had an unpaid insurance fee, although Haltzman said the Robbinses had arranged a payment plan at the time the photos were taken. The case has caught congressional attention. Sen. Arlen Specter, D-Pennsylvania, introduced legislation Thursday that would close what he sees as a loophole in federal wiretap laws. ""Many of us expect to be subject to certain kinds of video surveillance when we leave our homes and go out each day -- at the ATM, at traffic lights, or in stores, for example,"" Specter said. ""What we do not expect is to be under visual surveillance in our homes, in our bedrooms and, most especially, we do not expect it for our children in our homes.""","Attorney who filed motion accuses Pennsylvania district of ""spying""

"(CNN) -- A hard-line Iranian newspaper has called the French first lady a ""prostitute"" and recommended she be put to death for supporting a woman sentenced to death by stoning in Iran for adultery. Under the headline ""French prostitutes enter the human rights uproar,"" the Kayhan daily newspaper referred Saturday to Carla Bruni-Sarkozy as a ""prostitute"" after she released an open letter in support of Sakineh Ashtiani, 43, a mother of two whose case has drawn international attention. Kayhan, a newspaper headed by a representative of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, reiterated those statements Tuesday, writing that, ""this woman with a bad history supports an Iranian woman who has committed adultery during marriage and is an accomplice to the murder of her husband who is sentenced to death, and in fact she [Bruni-Sarkozy] also deserves death."" Iranian officials decried the newspaper's tirade. ""Insulting the authorities in other countries and using inappropriate words is not approved by the Islamic Republic,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast told reporters Tuesday in response to a question during his weekly briefing, according to the ministry's website. ""The media can criticize the policies, attitudes and comments of other countries' officials, they can object to them, we call for them to review their deeds, but we do not think applying insulting and degrading words is the right thing to do."" French Foreign ministry spokesman Bernard Valero said Tuesday that the comments are unacceptable. ""We're making this message known through normal diplomatic channels."" In her open letter, published on Bruni-Sarkozy's website, the former model said, ""Condemned to be buried alive, and then stoned to death! Your beautiful face, reduced to a pulp! Your eyes full of sorrow and dignity, your forehead, your mind, your soul, transformed into a target for the stone throwers, exploded, pulverized, in shreds! Horror and consternation!"" She added, ""Your judges must know, Sakineh, your name has become a symbol the world over. Let us hope they may understand that, no matter what the time or the place, they shall never be able to wash their hands of such a crime."" Bruni-Sarkozy said she is proud to live in a country that has abolished the death penalty, adding that she was praying that Iran would find a way to show clemency in her case. ""In France, schoolchildren learn that mercy is the greatest virtue of those who govern,"" she said. ""In the depths of your cell, know that my husband will plead your cause unfailingly and that France will not abandon you."" France has asked the European Union to come up with new approaches to get Iran to stop the pending execution. Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner raised the issue last week with EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, asking that measures be studied to stop Iran from violating human rights. ""We need to encourage the Union in initiatives to remind Iranian authorities that, as well on the nuclear file, their attitude of isolation has a price, which they can liberate as soon as they choose a more responsible behavior and more in line with their international commitments on the subject of human rights,"" Kouchner said in a letter to Ashton published in the French press.","NEW: Iranian newspaper reiterates its derogatory remarks about French first lady .

"A Seattle-area couple is in custody for allegedly holding captive and torturing the man's 13-year-old brother for three months -- including driving a nail through the boy's hand and keeping him in a cellar for days without food, the prosecutor said Wednesday. Brandon Gunn, 27, and his wife Viviana, 34, are in the Kitsap County Jail outside Seattle on $500,000 bail each, charged with kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment and four counts of assault, county prosecutor Cami Lewis said. Brandon's brother is from Atlanta and went in May to stay with his brother for the summer, Kitsap County Deputy Sheriff Scott Wilson said. ""We've been crying for days,"" the teen's aunt, Marsha Thomas-Jones, told CNN Atlanta affiliate WSB. ""My sister is devastated."" The alleged torture began as early as May 1 and lasted until the teenager escaped from his brother's cellar two weeks ago, according to the prosecutor's complaint, filed Tuesday. Thomas-Jones said the family suspected something was wrong months ago when communication ceased, and it tried unsuccessfully to get law enforcement involved early, WSB reported. The attorney for Brandon Gunn, Michele Taylor, was given the case only Wednesday and has not received any discovery documents, said her paralegal, Samantha Badkin. She said they don't expect to speak to their client until at least next Tuesday. A voicemail message for Viviana Gunn's attorney, Jeniece Lacross, was not returned late Wednesday. According to the probable cause certificate filed Monday by the Kitsap County Sheriff's Office, the boy was sent to the Gunns' garage where he was duct-taped to a chair with tape over his eyes and mouth, then beaten in the head, torso and legs with a baseball bat and metal bars, losing consciousness at times. Another time, the couple put the boy's hand in a bench vise, tightened it, and drove a nail through the his hand with a hammer, the certificate says. The boy said that time, he could see them doing it. The Gunns duct-taped his hands and hung him from a rafter in the garage, then beat him; they also stapled his right palm with a construction stapler, heated a knife and cut him with it, according to the certificate. The couple forced the boy to stay naked in a portable dog kennel twice for two to three days at a time, with no food or water, the certificate says. He also was forced to stay in the dark cellar for four days, and when he escaped to get food, he was punished by being beaten with a baseball bat, it says. The boy said the couple called the abuse ""punishment sessions"" for not doing chores or breaking household rules, and that the ""sessions"" would last for two to three hours, according to Deputy Sheriff Wilson. When the boy escaped, he had been duct-taped but managed to escape by moving his hands in front of him, peeling the tape off his mouth, then chewing through the tape binding his hands, Wilson said. He forced open the cellar door and then lived on the streets for two weeks, stealing food when he could, Wilson said. He was sleeping in a bus shelter on a Navy housing complex last Friday night when two Navy security officers found the boy and saw his injuries, Wilson said. They immediately sent the boy to a hospital where detectives interviewed him. They saw injuries to the boy's head, face, chest, abdomen, back, arms, legs, hands and feet, ranging from fresh open wounds to wounds that were in the process of healing, the certificate of probable cause says. The doctor also found a broken piece of metal in the boy's hand, possibly from the nail. ""In the first six hours they were able to develop enough probable cause for the arrest of the brother and the brother's wife,"" Wilson said. ""they were arrested at 7 a.m. (Saturday) at their house."" When detectives interviewed Brandon Gunn, he denied abusing the boy, saying only that he gave him a ""whooping"" with a belt on his backside a few times. Detectives searched the home and found blood stains on the wall, door, bench vise, baseball bat and chair, the certificate of probable cause says. They also found the dog kennel and staple gun, and a strong smell of urine in a corner of the cellar where the boy said he was forced to urinate, it says. The boy is out of the hospital and living with a foster family, Wilson said. The Gunns' next court appearance is scheduled for September 10 in Kitsap County District Court, said Lewis, the prosecutor.

"It was supposed to be the couple's happiest day: Kelly Ecker, a nurse, and Dr. George Scott Samson married Saturday afternoon in Terre Haute, Indiana. By their wedding night, both were dead. Samson, an anesthesiologist at Union Hospital in Terre Haute, shot his bride and then himself in their home just hours after they exchanged vows, authorities said. Some wedding guests noticed tension between the couple almost immediately after each said ""I do,"" said Vigo County Sheriff Chief Deputy Clark Cottom. ""Some guests are telling us the bride and groom didn't speak to each other at the reception,"" he said. After the reception, the couple hosted members of the bridal party at their home on outside Terre Haute, Cottom said. Not long after the last guest left, the county dispatch center received a 911 call, according to a transcript and tape provided by authorities. The 911 calls . The first call was made at 1:25 a.m. The caller, said to be Kelly, is only able to give an address, then the call cuts off. In a second call made a minute later, the caller says, ""he is beating the s*** out of me"" and then says ""he has guns"" and identifies Scott Samson by name. By the third call, at 1:27 a.m., Cottom said it's clear the situation has escalated because the caller's voice is in more distress.  She says ""oh my God!"" and then gunshots are heard. When deputies arrived on the scene, they were met at the door by an elderly male relative of Samson's, authorities said. ""He directed the deputies to the bedroom where they found Kelly's body,"" said Cottom. She had been shot multiple times, he said. Murder suicide shocks residents in Brisbane . Robot finds Samson . In addition to the male, two other people were found in home: Ecker's 10-year old-son was in the bedroom where his mother's body was found, and he was unharmed, Cottom said. An elderly female relative was in the home at the time of the shootings, and she also was unharmed, authorities said. Samson was still inside when deputies arrived, so they made it a priority to get those three people out of the home and to safety immediately, Cottom said. The elderly male witness told police that Samson had run from the bedroom to another part of the house to get more ammunition, and then ran to the basement, authorities said. Deputies surrounded the home immediately. ""The house is near a wooded area and a cornfield, and we didn't want an armed man running deep into the woods,"" Cottom said. A special response team used a robotic device equipped with a camera to gain entry into the home, he said. When it located Samson in the basement, it was apparent what had happened. ""Samson was unresponsive. We saw a bullet wound,"" Cottom said. Samson's body was found near his gun safe, where he had earlier removed other weapons, said Cottom.  Samson was a gun enthusiast who had a federal firearms license, Cottom said. This week, deputies were still taking inventory of the weapons inside the home. Cottom said several dozen of them had been removed. Montana newlywed gets 30 years for pushing husband off cliff .","Kelly Ecker, a nurse, and Dr. George Scott Samson marry over weekend .

"A group of Portuguese-speaking countries plans to meet Saturday to discuss a coup that roiled the tiny nation of Guinea-Bissau, plunging it into more chaos after nearly four decades of instability. Foreign ministers from the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries group will discuss the coup at a gathering in Lisbon. Guinea-Bissau is a member of the group. The group also includes Portugal, Angola, Mozambique and Brazil. Meanwhile, the military has called all of the country's political parties -- ""without exception"" -- to hold a meeting Saturday, said Daba Naualna, a spokesman for the army's chief of staff. ""The situation is normal. We are trying to find a solution,"" Naualna told CNN. Regarding the Lisbon talks, Naualna said that the military is following them. ""It is very far from Guinea-Bissau,"" he added. Coups and coup attempts are common in Guinea-Bissau since it won its independence from Portugal in 1974. In the latest coup, soldiers arrested the acting president and prime minister, a military spokesman said Friday, as gunfire and explosions rocked the capital of Bissau. President Raimundo Pereira and Prime Minister Carlos Gomes Jr. were taken into custody Thursday night, sparking international condemnation. Both leaders are well and alive, said Naualna. He said a group called the military command was behind the arrests, though it was unclear who its members are. Leaders of the nation's armed forces have taken control of the nation to ensure stability,  according to the spokesman. ""The (army chief of staff) thinks, for the sake of the country, that power cannot fall into the streets and decided to have (the military) play its part in seeking solutions with the political class to resolve this crisis,"" the spokesman said. Military leaders said they have no desire to ""stay in power"" and asked political parties to send ideas on what to do next by Sunday, the spokesman said. A meeting will take place that day to discuss the proposals. World leaders condemned the coup, which occurred just before the second round of a presidential election set for April 29. The African Union, the United Nations and the United States called for a return to civilian rule and demanded the release of the leaders. U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the United States was ""deeply concerned"" about the safety of residents. ""We urge all parties to put down their weapons, release government leaders immediately, and restore the legitimate civilian leadership,"" he said. ""We remain deeply concerned about the safety of the country's interim president, senior figures, and others who may be put in harm's way because of these actions,"" the White House said in a statement. In a statement, the military command said the revolt was in response to a ""secret deal"" between the government and Angola. This ""deal"" was drawn up to allow Angolan troops in the country to attack Guinea-Bissau's military,"" a communique from the group said. This group says the president and the prime minister signed the deal and accuses the African Union, whose rotating presidency is currently held by Angola, of supporting intervention by Angolan forces. Guinea-Bissau's history has been marked by several military coups and these conflicts have ravaged its infrastructure and economy, leaving it among the poorest in the world. The nation's first round of voting in a presidential election was held in March, and campaigning for the second round was about to begin. The election was prompted by the death of the incumbent Malam Bacai Sanha in January after a long illness. Residences of the prime minister and some government ministers were looted, witnesses said.  Public media outlets are under the control of the army and are regularly broadcasting statements from the military, witnesses said Friday. Angola, also a former Portuguese colony, issued a statement earlier this week stating its intention to unilaterally withdraw its troops. A number of Angolan troops are in the country to help reform the country's armed forces, Angola said. Sanha had become president in September 2009 after the assassination of his predecessor. Despite his coming to power in what international observers deemed a fair and peaceful election, his tenure was marked by turmoil among the country's military and political leadership. To date, no democratically elected president of the country has served a full, five-year term.","All of Guinea-Bissau's political parties are ordered to meet on Saturday too .

"Although I know my downward dog from my one-legged king pigeon pose, I'm relatively new to yoga. Yet even almost breaking my nose while attempting a handstand wasn't enough to take away the enjoyment of attending a 10-day yoga retreat in the Himalayan foothills. The Basunti retreat in Himachal Pradesh, north India, is set in a wildlife reserve in the Kangra Valley and offers immersion into one of the most spiritual regions of India. It's home to a leopard, mongoose, snakes, scorpions, butterflies, birds and sole fish, to name a few resident creatures. David Butterworth, co-owner of the retreat with his wife Izzy, is the resident storyteller. In one of his many animal-themed Basunti anecdotes, Butterworth explains how he once saw a sole fish jump out of a pond and snatch a spotted dove in flight. Though yoga retreats are on offer year-round, one of the best times to go to Basunti is October, when Bridget Woods Kramer is visiting. (This year, she'll be at Basunti October 3-12.) Kramer is one of the world's most acclaimed instructors of Anusara yoga -- a practice that focuses on the heart and individual ability of each student. Finding inner strength in the Kangra Valley . The Basunti day starts at 7 a.m. with a two-hour yoga session in the thatched shala facing the peaceful waters of the Kangra Valley. At the entrance stands a striking brass statue of the Hindu god Shiva, a symbol of strength. Practice begins gradually, with a talk by Kramer about Hindu gods and goddesses that resonate with yogic teachings and the benefits of yoga. A herd of cows quietly makes its way past, giving us curious glances as we twist and turn and try to maintain our balance. Kramer says the need to stand tall and strong in yoga translates into everyday life: ""It's a reminder to stand tall in the face of fear."" She caters to all levels, encouraging partner work or individual practice. Students on my retreat range from complete beginners to new or accomplished yoga teachers. Although I come crashing down on the marble floor while attempting a handstand, by the next attempt, and with a lot of encouragement from Kramer, I feel I could maintain the position for ages. Well, at least two seconds and with the support of three people. What I come to realize is that these seemingly acrobatic poses require self belief and confidence; the harder the pose, the more I have to silence my fears and gather resilience from within -- which makes me feel stronger on the whole. ""I could tell you could do it,"" Kramer says, reassuringly. ""I knew you were just feeling scared."" Before the day's second two-hour yoga session in the evening, we climb to the top of Basunti's main building roof, accompanied by religious chanting and traditional drumming from the local temple during evening prayers. The roof is encircled by plants and trees, all enclosed by Himalayan peaks, which gradually fade as the sun sets and night falls. Evening practice focuses on breathing techniques -- something that sounds simple enough but that we take for granted in everyday life. Using exercises to ease and open up areas of the chest and back change the way we feel, our posture and allows energy to flow freely through our bodies. Homegrown produce and ancient treasures . After a physically challenging but awakening session, a bell signals dinnertime, accompanied by the chanting of crickets, while guests mingle on the verandah. Basunti provides freshly prepared meals using local produce and has its own well. Visitors can try Basunti's homegrown lemons, aloe vera plants and traditional Indian neem plant, known for its effective healing properties. Orange, mango and papaya trees are also on the grounds. After a few days of lounging at Basunti, it's easy to forget you're in vibrant India. A boat ride in the nearby Maharana Pratap Sagar lake, a trip to the Dalai Lama's residence of McLeod Ganj, where he often gives talks, or a visit to the rock temples of Masroor, a few hours drive away, are reminders of the diversity outside the retreat's walls. Basunti will also arrange visits to a local shawl shop, which has beautiful original designs that make the perfect gifts. The Kangra Valley itself is steeped in history. ""The earliest settlers would have been Harappans from the Indus Valley civilization, evidence of this I have found when the water level recedes and the banks are exposed,"" says Butterworth. Treasures he's uncovered include Grey Ware pottery from around 1100-800 BC, as well as coins from the Mauryan dynasty through to the Mughal Empire and East India Company. Butterworth's family originates from the British Midlands, but he's the seventh generation born in India. ""I'm a good Punjabi boy!"" he laughs. Butterworth built the retreat himself using local laborers and resources. Sitting on what was originally a corn and winter wheat field, the construction of Basunti began in 2006. Today, it embraces the surroundings with wide, open spaces in between the buildings which contain beautifully designed, well appointed rooms. Getting there . The Basunti retreat is about a three and a half hour drive from Amritsar -- a private car collects visitors from the airport. Guests can also stay in Amritsar and ask to be picked up from their hotel. Yoga retreats are held throughout the year, hosted by teachers from around the world who specialize in a variety of styles. Basunti also hosts regular painting, fishing and photography retreats. The Basunti website has the full 2014 schedule.","India's Basunti retreat is located in the Kangra Valley, one of the most spiritual regions of India .

"If YouTube is really on the verge of buying video game-streaming website Twitch, there's at least one reason behind the move that's as old as business itself: eliminating the competition. Little known outside the gaming world, Twitch has quietly skyrocketed, claiming 43 million monthly users just three years after it launched. Those users, Twitch says, watch an hour-and-a-half of video a day, much of it live coverage of things like video game competitions and other players working their way through new games. As it turns out, watching people play video games is a big deal on the Web. At YouTube, which is owned by Google, some players have amassed follower bases of more than 1 million people by posting video of themselves gaming. So when an upstart like Twitch comes along, analysts say, it makes sense for Google to act. ""For Google, this is a defensive measure as much as it is anything else,"" said James McQuivey, a technology analyst with Forrester Research. ""Google found early on with YouTube that play-throughs of video games were a huge traffic draw. If you don't watch those videos, you don't even know they exist on YouTube. But for people who watch them, that's all they see."" On Sunday, both the Wall Street Journal and Variety were reporting that YouTube is in talks to buy Twitch for more than $1 billion. Neither company was commenting publicly on Monday. Microsoft and Amazon are among several other companies who were reportedly trying to purchase the site. More than just a place to stream video, Twitch has also succeeded at becoming a social network of sorts, McQuivey said. Comments are integrated into the site's videos, letting viewers talk with each other, or even the players themselves, as they watch. ""It's no longer just wanting to see how someone defeated the boss on Level 5,"" he said. ""It's having that social experience and the comradeship of fellow gamers. Twitch has nailed that and if you're Google, you realize that people watching stale old videos ... that's going to dry up."" And on the Internet, traffic means money. Advertisers like live events because of the level of excitement they create and the fact that they can reach a target audience all at once, McQuivey said. Twitch made headlines in February when a version of ""Pokemon Red/Blue,"" a 1990s game for Nintendo's Game Boy, streamed on the online video platform for days, allowing more than 80,000 people to play simultaneously. For Twitch, the appeal of an eight-figure deal (aside from the eight figures) would be gaining Google's arguably unrivaled resources to support and expand its site. In some ways, Twitch's massive growth in a short time has been a blessing and a curse. Twitch generates more traffic than HBO Go in the United States and has tripled the amount of bandwidth it uses in the past year, according to Sandvine, a networking-equipment company. ""To be quite honest, we can't keep up with the growth,"" Twitch Vice President Matt DiPietro told The Verge last year. ""That's a good problem to have."" Add Google to the mix, and that problem disappears. ""I think the whole concept started as a social experiment,"" McQuivey said. ""It became a commercial business so rapidly that they weren't prepared and they didn't have the resources ... . When Google wants to care about the outcome of your business ... it ends up being a really good deal."" In this way, it's not unlike Facebook's recent purchase of Oculus VR, which gave that upstart maker of virtual-reality headsets access to Facebook's vast resources and user base. Regardless of the outcome of this deal, McQuivey says live streaming is something YouTube is going to have to figure out. Increasingly, the entertainment industry is using live TV events -- from ""The Sound of Music"" to live voting on ""The Voice"" -- to attract viewers who have become increasingly spoiled by the overabundance of digital media at their disposal. ""The next thing you're going to have to get into is live-streaming your high school football game or you trying to conquer a new rail with your skateboard,"" McQuivey said. ""If you can get into a world where someone wants to show off that they're better on the half-pipe than anybody else in the world, you could have a couple thousand people watching live to see if you can pull off that back flip.""","Reports say Google's YouTube is in talks to buy Twitch .

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- Where are the lost boys of Mexico? That's what many people, in that country and around the world, want to know. The answer could say much about the new narrative that has been pushed about the country. This week, Jesus Murillo Karam, Mexico's attorney general, issued arrest warrants for three people in connection with a shocking case that has captured the attention of the entire country: the disappearance of 43 students, who went missing after being confronted by police. More than four dozen people have been arrested, including police officers, local officials and members of a drug gang. For residents of the small town of Iguala, which lies 120 miles southwest of Mexico City, the nightmare began on September 26 — just 10 days after the festivities celebrating Mexico's Independence Day. That's when a group of young men, between the ages of 18 and 25, who were studying at a nearby teachers college, traveled to Iguala to protest what they claimed were the school's discriminatory hiring practices. Mexican prosecutors believe a small-town mayor named Jose Luis Abarca and his wife, Maria de los Angeles Pineda Villa, might know the students' whereabouts. Unfortunately, we can't find out for sure because the couple is on the run. Also missing is the town's former police chief, Felipe Flores Velásquez. All three are fugitives. The investigation of the case has prompted speculation that Abarca was so worried that the students might disrupt his wife's speech that he ordered Flores to have police officers confront the students and stop the protest. (According to Murillo Karam, another protest had previously upset Abarca). Police reportedly opened fire on the vehicles in which the students were traveling. Six people were killed, and the 43 students went missing. Eyewitnesses told prosecutors they saw the young men being crammed into police cars. But it gets worse. According to the attorney general, the police quickly turned the students over to Guerreros Unidos, a local drug trafficking gang. The prosecutor claimed that Abarca and his wife keep bad company. Pineda's brothers are suspected drug traffickers. And, according to the attorney general, the first lady of Iguala has been called ""the main operator of criminal activities"" in the town. The leader of Guerreros Unidos told officials that, once police turned over the students, he ordered his henchmen to make them disappear. The attorney general said the young men were loaded onto a pickup truck and driven to a remote location populated by mass graves. And that's where the story ends — for now. Since this is Mexico we're talking about, where people don't trust their government and always assume there is a backstory, some people won't accept the official version of events. In fact, these days, young people in Mexico hold hearings in a new court of public opinion: Twitter and Facebook. And, on social media, the current debate is whether this mass abduction was, as the attorney general says, a case of criminal misconduct by a rogue local official or something more nefarious. Was the federal government involved? Or was it at least aware that this was happening? This being Mexico, one has to ask. After all, this is the land of the desaparecidos. In the 1970s, there were at least 2,000 documented cases of people who simply disappeared after challenging government officials. Those people were never found, and the cases never solved. Even if this is an isolated incident — and that's a big ""if"" given how closely intertwined drug gangs are with Mexican officials — the blame isn't limited to the individuals who have been arrested or are being sought. It extends to the Mexican people, many of whom long ago made a devil's bargain with the drug traffickers who are threatening to tear the country apart. They built altars to La Santa Muerte, the patron ""saint"" of drug lords, wrote corridos (folkloric ballads) praising the exploits of traffickers, and accepted the fruits of an illicit trade. The reality is that the modern Mexican drug dealer isn't living in a camp in the mountains. He's a Spanish-speaking version of Tony Soprano. He lives in the suburbs, drives a Cadillac, and spends weekends attending his kids' soccer games — which are played on a field that he built. It's no wonder that, when former Mexican President Felipe Calderon waged war against the cartels, he was ridiculed and criticized by many Mexicans for stirring the hornet's nest. South of the border, drug traffickers are familia. It will be interesting to see if any of that changes in light of the disappearance of the students. For Mexicans, their most treasured institution is still the family. Those who threaten it do so at their peril. Already, the case has claimed a political casualty. On Friday, Angel Aguirre, the governor of Guerrero, appeared to yield to public pressure over the disappearances, requesting a leave of absence. By the way, much of this is not meant for the public consumption of Americans. When you talk to Mexico's elites on both sides of the border — lawyers, politicians, businessmen — what you hear again and again is that Mexico had a makeover. Desperate for U.S. investment dollars — now more than ever, given Mexico's recent and historic efforts to open up the country's lucrative petroleum industry to foreign investment — the elites aggressively push a narrative that Mexico is safe, democratic and open for business. Now, due to events in a small Mexican town, that narrative is being challenged by reality. Unfortunately, the new version of Mexico bears a resemblance to the old one.","Search is still on in Mexico for 43 students who went missing last month .

"It's largely devoid of human life, dark and viciously cold at times and frequently subject to dangerous levels of geological volatility -- the Arctic is surely the worst possible destination for an arts festival. That hasn't put off the organizers of SALT -- an event aimed at bringing entertainment to remote regions while showcasing the bleak but beautiful landscapes to new audiences. If that doesn't sound tough enough -- the event is due to last for eight years. And it gets underway as winter approaches. ""Ninety percent of festivals are in the summer when the weather is hopefully nice,"" says Erlend Mogard-Larsen, a veteran festival organizer who, with Norwegian curator Helga-Marie Nordby, is SALT's driving force. ""We're interested in the possibilities across the year in these regions, especially when the light dwindles in December. We want to use nature to make this event."" Nordby says the festival is an attempt to explore the ""Arctic state of mind"" using landscapes as a gateway into local lifestyles. The program features performances from the Arctic Philharmonic Orchestra, Norwegian DJ Are Mokkelbost, and Ensemble Ylajali, a female vocal group from Bodo, Norway. The headline act -- at least until February 2015 -- is an outdoor film installation by Chinese filmmaker and artist Yang Fudong, the first of what Nordby hopes will be numerous international contributions. Supersized sauna . Although SALT kicks off on August 29 on Sandhornoya Island, in northern Norway, just as the last warmth of summer evaporates, the festival has a steamy secret weapon up its sleeve. It'll debut ""Amfi,"" a giant insulated amphitheater that will host film screenings, seminars and larger concerts. When the weather gets particularly rough, the facility transforms into a sauna, releasing enough sweltering heat for 120 people. SALT will spend a year on Sandhornoya before moving to destinations including Greenland, Alaska, Ireland, Scotland, the Faroe Islands and Iceland. Wooden structures have already begun to populate the island. Along a two-kilometer beach strip, colossal fish racks mirroring the region's age-old trading culture will double as a performance arenas for artists. Festival-goers will also be invited to exchange their tents with a ""njalla,"" a tiny mobile hut kitted out with a glass roof to view the northern lights. Instead of the usual festival unhealthy fast food selection, there'll be fresh fish and ethically sourced meat. Well-equipped cabins . Nordby says one of SALT's goals is to show participants how the Arctic's peripatetic population has traditionally lived in harmony with its environment. ""Nature is quite vulnerable in these regions and this was of course the knowledge that the nomads had,"" she says. ""Their way of living was really about 'living with this' and using nature in a very sustainable and careful way."" Of course, unlike festival-goers, these nomads weren't residing in cabins equipped with comfy bunks and wood-burning stoves. ""The idea behind the project is to embrace the philosophy of movement here, when we are moving around to Greenland, Iceland or wherever we are going, we want make as few footprints as possible,"" says Nordby. ""People living up here have always brought their houses and belongings with them on a constant basis -- they had to move,"" says Mogard-Larsen. ""It's actually very hard to see the people who have been living here ... footprints are few."" The roughness of the weather coupled with the scenery's beauty make for an experience that's sure to astound and revitalize bored metropolitans -- provided their huts don't get blown to pieces. Nordby says that city dwellers can learn a lot from the living conditions of Arctic territories. She says that swapping their worlds of dwindling leisure time and excessive working hours for lands where elk and deer populations far exceed humans will help them gain a new sense of perspective. ""Most of us who live in big cities have this feeling of fragmentation, this loss of something to hold on to,"" she says. ""When you reach this beach and come to this place ... there is something happening with you, you get the feeling that you're part of something so much bigger than yourself."" The SALT festival comes at a particularly significant time for the Arctic. Several countries are eyeing the untapped resources that lie dormant under its mounds of ice and rocky land, while climate change is affecting the region at twice the rate of the rest of the world. Climate fluctuation . Trekking across Norway throughout 2011 and 2012, Nordby and Mogard-Larsen were astounded by the climate's fluctuations. Nordby recalls the sensitive landscapes. ""When it comes to climate change and environmental challenges you can see this very clearly in the Arctic. We have these huge ice mountains that are melting, every year huge parts of these areas are gone,"" she says. ""We also see it in the extreme weather -- northern Norway is usually quite rough in the summer season, but now, it's been 30 degrees (86F) almost all summer. It's crazy, it shouldn't be 30 degrees up here!"" The pair say the planet's northern reaches act as a true barometer for global warming, and as the region is exposed to a wider audience, its changing landscape won't be so easily ignored. ""The way we live today across the world means that we're shortening the future,"" says Nordby. ""This landscape is reminding us of something that we need to be reminded of."" SALT Festival will debut on the island of Sandhornoya, Norway, running from August 29, 2014 to September 6, 2015.","SALT Festival to kick off on the Norwegian island of Sandhornoya from August 29 .

"A trio of heavily armed state troopers looked down intently from a bridge in rural Pennsylvania. Behind them, a slow procession of unmarked cars climbed a steep hill to deliver the next tour of local, state and federal law enforcement agents in the nearly two-week hunt for cop-killing suspect Eric Matthew Frein. Broken branches beneath the span caught the troopers' attention. Two officers, carrying rifles and wearing ballistic vests, descended to inspect. The third stood guard above. Every disturbed branch merits a closer look for clues to the whereabouts of the self-styled survivalist with a grudge against law enforcement. Frein, 31, is the suspect in a September 12 ambush that left Cpl. Byron Dickson dead and another trooper wounded outside the Pennsylvania State Police barracks in Blooming Grove, Pennsylvania. On Wednesday, with as many as 1,000 law enforcement officers involved in the manhunt at a given time, authorities revealed that the meticulous, grid-like search over up to 3 square miles of hilly terrain may be paying off. There have been a number of sightings of a man believed to be Frein -- a war buff obsessed with Eastern European military conflicts -- by both local residents and police, State Police Lt. Col George Bivens said without giving further details. The last sighting came about 24 hours ago. The sightings were from a significant distance, however, and Frein has continued to elude authorities. The search has yielded an empty pack of Serbian cigarettes, Bivens said. Frein claims to have fought with Serbians in Africa and has studied Russian and Serbian languages, according to the FBI, which last week named him one of its 10 Most Wanted fugitives. Soiled adult diapers were also found, perhaps used by Frein to stay in a stationary position for long periods of time. ""I think this is a game to him in some ways,"" Bivens said. It's a game that's wearing thin on some residents of Pike and Monroe counties who have been affected by the massive manhunt. Local lawyer Joshua Prince is asking residents who feel that their rights have been violated during the police manhunt to contact his law firm. ""I've spoken with a number of individuals who have either been excluded from their homes, ordered to stay in their homes or have been subjected to searches of their vehicles all without warrants or court orders,"" he said. ""These are innocent third parties,"" he added. ""They have no relationship with Mr. Frein, and the Pennsylvania State Police and FBI appear to be merely doing whatever they want up there and ordering people to allow them to go through their homes and vehicles, all in violation of the U.S. Constitution."" In a statement Tuesday night, the Pennsylvania State Police, the lead agency in the investigation, said that ""at no time"" were residents completely restricted from access to their homes. ""To clear up any misconceptions regarding the search, we have been diligent in respecting the rights of the public while working hard to keep both residents and law enforcement personnel safe. We need to be deliberate and methodical in our operations, as we still believe that Eric Frein is armed and very dangerous,"" the statement said. Bivens thanked residents for their ""patience and understanding"" and said troopers were ""doing their best to balance safety concerns."" Over the weekend, authorities discovered an AK-47 rifle, some magazines and a small bag of ammo believed to belong to Frein. Greg Huelbig, who owns the 402 Cafe about 100 yards away, said many residents were inconvenienced but understood the work of law enforcement. ""There is frustration, but I don't think it's due to the troopers or local responders doing their jobs,"" he said. ""It's an inconvenience, obviously. ... We're frustrated because the search is still ongoing and we have a dangerous criminal in our backyard. ... Everybody that's talking about being locked out or being locked down, they understand why it's happening. But yes, they're frustrated. They're upset."" Area schools opened Tuesday for the first time since the middle of last week, although some school buses were kept off roads because of heavy police activity. There was increased security throughout the Pocono Mountain School District, and students would remain indoors, according to the district's website. ""This is an extremely difficult situation for our community,"" the website said. ""Schools will be in session but, ultimately it is your decision as parents whether to send your children to school. The District will respect your decision and all absences will be excused and will not impact a student's perfect attendance."" For the moment, the reopening of schools and roads Tuesday provided a sense of relief vof a community under virtual lockdown. On Wednesday, attendance in the 9,800-student district was up to 84% after dropping to 70% the day before. After-school athletic practices were moved indoors and home athletic competitions canceled. ""I talked to a mom or two that hadn't sent their children to school but wanted to know how things were going,"" district spokeswoman Wendy Frable said. ""Once I reassured them, they said they were considering sending their children to school. They're concerned about the safety of the students."" Bivens said an examination of Frein's notes and reading material as well as interviews with relatives and others reveal that he probably had planned the shootings for months, if not years. The distance and rugged terrain separating officers from the suspect during recent sightings meant ""he has had the ability to disappear,"" Bivens said. Slaying planned for months? Authorities have said that Frein hated law enforcement and that they believe that he's solely focused on hurting more officers but not civilians. ""We're not going away,"" Bivens said. ""We'll be here until we apprehend him."" For residents, life in the Pocono Mountains has changed. ""We're the country, but it doesn't seem very country-ish right now,"" Frable said. ""It's not the normal routine.""","A number of sightings of Eric Frein have been reported in rural Pennsylvania .

"Washington (CNN)  -- Abortion rights supporters and opponents hit the streets of the nation's capital Friday to mark the 37th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court ruling establishing a woman's constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy. Anti-abortion activists held a rally on the National Mall and marched to the Supreme Court, followed by a walk to Capitol Hill to urge legislative action. An annual March for Life has been held in Washington since 1974. ""We want to change people's hearts and minds and help them to know that abortion ... is not necessary and really undermines the rights of women,"" U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops spokeswoman Deirdre McQuade told CNN. ""We're working toward the day when abortion will not only be illegal but unthinkable."" Abortion rights supporters, led in part by the National Organization for Women, planned their own rally and vigil on the steps of the high court. ""A fetus is not a life, sorry,"" NOW President Terry O'Neill told CNN. ""And no, nobody's religious conviction justifies taking women's ability to shape their own futures away from them."" Activists on both sides of the highly divisive issue believe there is a chance the conservative-leaning high court could eventually overturn the 1973 ruling. Questions regarding abortion rights have played a key role in the health care reform debate. A number of abortion rights supporters believe a bill passed by the House of Representatives in November does not do enough to provide access to reproductive services. Many abortion rights opponents say legislation approved by the Senate in December does not go far enough to ensure taxpayer dollars are not used to fund abortions. CNN's Paul Courson, David de Sola and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.","37 years ago Roe v. Wade established a woman's right to terminate pregnancy .

"Can legal pot follow the path of same-sex marriage to wider acceptance around the country? Supporters hope so, in the wake of victorious marijuana legalization campaigns in Oregon, the District of Columbia, and, as appears likely, in Alaska. The D.C. vote brings legal pot into the backyard of the federal government, which still classifies marijuana as one of the most dangerous substances -- on par with heroin. Related: Voters in D.C., Oregon approve legal marijuana . Related: Republicans seize control of the Senate . Attorney General Eric Holder told CNN recently that he's ""cautiously optimistic"" about the way Colorado and Washington state so far have handled their legal pot industries. The Justice Department issued guidelines to federal prosecutors last year to focus their attention on eight priorities in marijuana enforcement, including stopping distribution of marijuana to minors, and blocking gangs and cartels from benefiting. The federal government still bans marijuana from federal property, including national parks, which takes up a significant chunk of the capital city. A Justice Department spokesman said: ""When we developed our department priorities over a year ago, we intended to set out a consistent enforcement approach that would be applicable across the country. As our Aug. 29, 2013 guidance memorandum laid out, the department's enforcement resources will continue to be aimed at the most significant threats to our communities. This approach relies on states instituting strict regulatory regimes to adequately protect public safety."" The D.C. law could take effect in March of 2015, if Congress doesn't find a way to step in to block it during a review period. A Republican lawmaker from Maryland has vowed to try to block the DC law, but Sen. Rand Paul, who is in line for a powerful Senate post overseeing the District of Columbia, has said he opposes any congressional interference on the will of city voters. ""This victory is dedicated to everyone still sitting in jail tonight because of marijuana prohibition,"" Adam Eidinger, the Chair of the DC Cannabis Campaign, said in a statement. ""District residents have made their voices heard loud and clear. The road to justice won't end on Capitol Hill.""

"Two Durham VA Medical Center employees have been put on administrative leave because of ""inappropriate scheduling practices,"" the Department of Veteran Affairs said in a Monday statement. The facility in Durham, North Carolina, is at least the fourth hospital accused of manipulating health care appointments. VA Secretary Eric Shinseki has ordered an audit at all VA clinics, following months of CNN exclusive reporting about U.S. veterans who have died while they waited for treatment at VA hospitals. ""In preparation for this audit, VHA (Veterans Health Administration) Central Office learned on May 12 that a Durham VA Medical Center employee indicated that some employees at that facility may have engaged in inappropriate scheduling practices at some point between 2009 and 2012,"" the Monday statement read. ""VA takes any allegations about patient care or employee misconduct very seriously.  If the allegations are true, the inappropriate behavior is unacceptable and employees will be held accountable."" The latest allegation comes as the federal department defends itself against claims of potentially deadly delays at other facilities throughout the nation, including claims of a secret wait list in Phoenix, which was first reported by CNN. A VA scheduler in San Antonio said clerks scheduling medical appointments for veterans were ""cooking the books"" at their bosses' behest to hide the fact some had to wait weeks, if not months, for appointments. Similarly, a scheduler at the VA clinic in Fort Collins, Colorado, which is managed by a Wyoming clinic, said employees were told to manipulate the system. The VA's official policy is that all patients should be able to see a doctor, dentist or some other medical professional within 14 days of their requested/preferred date. Any wait longer than two weeks is supposed to documented. But many veterans end up waiting longer, and the delays are never reported, veterans and their advocates say. Shinseki has been subpoenaed by the House Veterans' Affairs Committee. CNN has submitted numerous requests for an interview with Shinseki; the secretary has refused them all.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A company that says it produced videos about a cursing teddy bear fond of prostitutes is suing Seth MacFarlane over his ""Ted"" movie. ""Ted"" is ""strikingly similar"" to ""Charlie the Abusive Teddy Bear,"" Bengal Mangle Productions contends in a copyright infringement lawsuit filed Wednesday. ""Charlie is a teddy bear who lives in a human, adult world with all human friends,"" the complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles said. ""Charlie has a penchant for drinking, smoking, prostitutes, and is a generally vulgar yet humorous character."" Their copyrighted vulgar bear was featured in videos on YouTube and FunnyorDie.com in 2009, three years before MacFarlane's ""Ted"" hit theaters, earning $549 million at the box office worldwide, the complaint said. ""Ted"" copies ""Charlie's"" background story, persona, voice tone, attitude and dialogue, the suit said. The two bears' Twitter postings were even similar, it said, giving a long list of comparisons, including: . ""Charlie"" tweeted on March 7, 2009: ""I have a life mission and it is to drink."" ""Ted"" tweeted on April 4, 2012: ""I drink on Tuesday night to celebrate the fact that it ain't Monday night."" Both bears are ""'washed-up' child stars/public personas"" and ""both Charlie and Ted spend a significant amount of time sitting on a living room couch with a beer and/or cigarette in hand,"" the lawsuit contends. Seth MacFarlane: Renaissance man . MacFarlane and Universal Pictures, which also is named as a defendant, did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.
