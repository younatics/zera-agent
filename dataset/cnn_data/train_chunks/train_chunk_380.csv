"(CNN) -- Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said Saturday that the country's state of emergency, in effect since 1963, should be lifted by next week at the latest -- but that the final decision is up to the newly sworn-in Cabinet. Al-Assad made the announcement Saturday hours after the Cabinet was sworn in, and two days after he announced the formation of a new government. Opposition forces have been demanding the repeal of the emergency law, which allows the government to make preventive arrests and override constitutional and penal code statutes. the law also bars detainees who haven't been charged from filing court complaints or from having a lawyer present during interrogations. ""We (will) lift the state of emergency contrary to the opinion of many others who think this might lead to imbalance in the state of security,"" al-Assad said as he chaired a meeting of the new government. ""I disagree with this, and I think this will consolidate the security of the country."" The president indicated he wants a new law allowing demonstrations to take place while protecting the public from ""any chaos or damage to properties"" and allowing Syrian security forces to enforce the law. ""We have to distinguish between reform and chaos,"" he said. ""The Syrian people are civilized people. They don't like chaos, they don't like instability."" The new Cabinet includes a new prime minister -- Adel Safar, a Baath Party member who was the agricultural minister in the previous Cabinet, which resigned last month. Syria retained its foreign minister, Walid al-Moallem, and defense minister, Ali Habib, but there are new heads in other positions, including the key posts of interior, finance, and media affairs, Syrian television said. The announcement of the new Cabinet came amid continued anti-regime protests and clashes between demonstrators and security forces, a conflict that has caused scores of deaths. Al-Assad expressed sadness over the deaths and sent his condolences to the families of everyone who has died in the unrest. ""This period we pass through, the blood that has been shed in Syria, has been painful for all Syrians,"" he said. ""We are saddened by the death of any person who has been sacrificed."" He said an investigation committee is looking into the deaths. Saturday afternoon, residents in Daraa rallied in the southern town's central square, according to a doctor there who declined to be named out of fear for his security. The thousands who gathered there chanted for the reform of the regime, trials for officials responsible for protesters' deaths, and solidarity with protesters in other cities. The doctor said no security forces or police were present and there were no injuries. Daraa was one of several cities where anti-government demonstrations happened Friday. Witnesses also reported demonstrations in Baniyas, Dair Elzour, Douma, Zabadani, the outskirts of Damascus and other cities where protesters called for political, economic and social changes. In most locales, the day seemed peaceful compared with previous Fridays, when bloody clashes left many dead and injured. Still, the Syrian Arab News Agency, the official government news service, said a police sergeant was ""martyred"" after being assaulted by protesters in Homs. Among the opposition demands is the end of one-party rule in Syria. Al-Assad had already said he was studying whether to end the 48-year-old state of emergency and provide citizenship for stateless people in the Kurdish region as a way to placate the demonstrators. Activists, however, say the government has cracked down violently on peaceful protesters. That claim is disputed by the Syrian government, which blames armed groups for attacking security forces and citizens. Human Rights Watch, a prominent humanitarian watchdog group, issued a report Friday detailing ""torture and ill-treatment"" of protesters over the past month, and U.N. human rights experts released a statement deploring the crackdown on peaceful demonstrations. In his address Saturday, al-Assad said the new government must ""narrow the gap between officials and the public"" and expand government transparency. He also discussed the need to address government corruption, the high cost of living, and the high rate of youth unemployment.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Large explosions and the sound of jets over Tripoli Thursday night indicated NATO has likely increased the intensity of its air strikes on Moammar Gadhafi's key command and control military sites. CNN's Fred Pleitgen, reporting from Libya, heard at least three major explosions. The alliance has issued a new warning to Libyan civilians to stay away from military areas, foreshadowing plans for attacks on targets seen as strategically significant in stopping the government's attacks against civilians, a NATO military official said Thursday. The next phase will largely involve increased air strikes on key Gadhafi command, control and communications sites in and around Tripoli, although targets in other areas could be hit as well, said the official, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. NATO now has the use of armed U.S. Predator drones at its disposal. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates disclosed that the drones saw their first use in Libya Thursday, but poor weather forced them to return. Unmanned aerial vehicles offer more precise targeting, because their low-flying capability allows for better visibility, ""particularly on targets now that have started to dig themselves into defensive positions,"" Gates said. The Predators bring ""capabilities to the NATO commander that they didn't have before,"" he said. President Barack Obama approved their use. Rebels, who have complained that NATO was not being aggressive enough to protect civilians, said Thursday they had gained control of a key border crossing into Tunisia. The crossing at Wazen, Libya, could prove key to access to the city of Nalut, under siege by Gadhafi's forces for the past month. Thousands have fled the fighting through Wazen to the nearby Tunisian town of Dehiba, where temporary camps have been set up for the displaced. The Tunisian state-run news agency, TAP, also reported the rebel takeover of Wazen after early morning fighting. About 100 forces loyal to Gadhafi, including a high-ranking officer, fled across the border into Tunisia, said Mohammed Ali Abdallah, spokesman for National Front for the Salvation of Libya. He said the rebels detained 14 members of Gadhafi's forces. TAP reported that 13 Libyan officers have been detained by Tunisian military authorities. Also Thursday, a third ship chartered by the International Organization for Migration made its way back from the besieged city of Misrata to the rebel stronghold of Benghazi in the east. More than 1,000 rescued migrants were on board, as were the bodies of photojournalists Tim Hetherington and Chris Hondros, killed in Misrata on Wednesday, the organization said. The ship also repatriated the body of an Ukrainian doctor. Several banners were displayed as the Ionian Spirit docked late Thursday in Benghazi. One read: ""We feel for the families of the deceased, your blood was mixed with us in Misrata and with your loss you shared with us the price for freedom."" Another said, ""US and UK with your loss, you shared with us the price of freedom."" Hondros was American and Hetherington had dual British and U.S. citizenship. Twenty rebel fighters stood in military formation as the vessel arrived. The reported rebel takeover Thursday of Wazen comes at a time when many are questioning whether a military victory over Gadhafi is possible. France and Italy announced Wednesday that they will send military officers to Libya to advise the rebels. After a similar announcement by the British government Tuesday, French government spokesman Francois Baroin said a ""small number"" of French troops was being sent to advise the rebels' Transitional National Council. French Defense Minister Gerard Longuet has ruled out sending ground troops to fight alongside the rebels. ""This is a real issue that deserves an international debate,"" he said, adding, ""We are working within the framework of the 1973 resolution,"" a reference to the U.N. resolution that authorized action in Libya. ""You cannot please everyone all the time,"" he said. Italy will send military advisers to train the rebels in self-defense tactics, Italian Foreign Ministry spokesman Maurizio Massari announced. Britain said its contingent of military officers will be sent to Benghazi to serve in an advisory role. The team will work with the Transitional National Council to help the opposition improve its military organizational structures, communications and logistics, the British Foreign Office said. It will also help deliver aid. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Wednesday she has recommended that Obama authorize the U.S. government to send up to $25 million in non-lethal commodities and services to support Libyan rebels, including the Transitional National Council. On Thursday, Clinton urged more patience from critics of the anti-Gadhafi campaign, noting that ""it is always a temptation in any conflict to (want) a resolution quickly."" ""The opposition that rose up spontaneously was not a trained militia,"" she noted. The ""vast majority"" of insurgents ""had never participated in (any form of military) activity before."" Clinton said Washington has ""a lot of confidence in NATO"" and is pleased with the performance of America's allies in the conflict. In Libya, rebel spokesman Jalal al Gallal called Wednesday's announcements by France and Italy ""positive."" ""We are pleased with the results, and I think it's a prelude to more cooperation,"" he said. ""The more advisers we have on the ground, the better coordination we'll have on the battlefield."" At least 27 people have been killed and 142 have been injured in Libya this week, according to an opposition spokesman who wanted to be identified only as Mohammed for safety reasons. Among them were the two acclaimed photojournalists. Hondros and Hetherington, who was nominated for an Oscar for a gritty and harrowing documentary about the Afghan war, both died Wednesday in a rocket-propelled grenade attack in Misrata. Mohammed said rebels have ""annihilated"" Gadhafi forces and have defeated snipers in the city in the past few days. Three loyalist tanks remain on Tripoli Street, he said. CNN could not independently verify his claims. The city's hospital has reported nine deaths and 68 injuries.

"(CNN)""Birdman"" will go into the history books as 2014's best picture winner, but the 87th Academy Awards will also be remembered for a handful of stirring moments -- and a few awkward ones: . Common and John Legend's song ""Glory,"" written for the film ""Selma,"" had the Oscar crowd visibly moved with its rousing message, accompanied by a full gospel chorus. David Oyelowo, who played Martin Luther King Jr. in the film, had tears running down his face. After winning the Oscar, both Common and Legend used their speeches for some eloquent points. ""This bridge was once a landmark of a divided nation, but now is a symbol for change. The spirit of this bridge transcends race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, and social status. ... This bridge was built on hope,"" said Common. Complete winners list . But Legend added a note of warning. ""We wrote this song for a film that was based on events that were 50 years ago, but we say Selma is now, because the struggle for justice is right now,"" he said, invoking threats to the Voting Rights Act and the level of correctional control of African-American men. Patricia Arquette won best supporting actress for playing an independent-minded mother in ""Boyhood."" She stood up for her character -- and all women -- in her acceptance speech. ""To every woman who gave birth, to every taxpayer and citizen of this nation, we have fought for everybody else's equal rights, it's our time to have wage equality once and for all, and equal rights for women in the United States of America,"" she said. Meryl Streep was so struck she stood up, pointing in solidarity. Lady Gaga often hides her musical talent behind attention-getting outfits, including a meat dress and -- at tonight's Oscars -- some dishwashing-like red gloves. But the Grammys have shown she's a heck of a pianist, and at the Oscars she let her voice roar on a medley from ""The Sound of Music."" Julie Andrews herself was awed by Gaga's performance, applauding and thanking her. An excited Graham Moore, who won best adapted screenplay for ""The Imitation Game,"" started his speech almost beside himself with joy. But after a breath, he turned somber. ""When I was 16 years old, I tried to kill myself,"" he said. ""Because I felt weird, and I felt different, and I felt like I did not belong. And now I'm standing here, and I would like for this moment to be for that kid out there who feels like she's weird or she's different or doesn't fit anywhere. Yes, you do."" Early in the evening, the Oscar for best documentary short went to ""Crisis Hotline: Veterans Press 1,"" a film about the struggles of returning veterans. As part of her acceptance speech, Dana Perry, one of the producers, dedicated her Oscar to her son. He suffered from bipolar disorder and committed suicide in 2005. ""We should talk about suicide out loud,"" she said. Resources for suicide awareness and prevention include the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and The Trevor Project. Neil Patrick Harris mostly acquitted himself -- jokes about ""the best and the whitest"" and a skit based on ""Birdman"" went over well -- but he had a couple awkward moments. The most notable came after the win for ""Citizenfour,"" a documentary about NSA contractor Edward Snowden. After director Laura Poitras gave a speech warning about invasion of privacy, Harris tried to lighten the mood. Snowden couldn't be here tonight ""for some treason,"" Harris said. That got him in trouble online. He wasn't the only one. Terrence Howard took a while to get through his introduction of three best picture nominees, prompting some wags to wonder if he was practicing for a future episode of ""Empire."" Sean Penn received complaints for a crack about ""Birdman"" director Alejandro Gonzalez Iñarritu, a Mexican: ""Who gave this son of a bitch his green card?"" And then there was the luckless John Travolta, who shared a microphone with Idina Menzel. Last year, Travolta was immortalized for calling Menzel ""Adele Dazeem."" This year, he got her name right but also got a little handsy with the singer. Social media had a field day. Your move, Galom Gazingo.","""Glory"" got a rousing ovation .

"People confess to a lot of things on Facebook: their frustrations, bad habits, secret longings and new loves. A Florida man confessed to something much more sinister Thursday. He said he killed his wife. Derek Medina, 31, posted a picture of Jennifer Alfonso's blood-stained body -- collapsed and contorted on the kitchen floor -- to his Facebook feed with a note, according to authorities. ""Im going to prison or death sentence for killing my wife love you guys miss you guys takecare Facebook people you will see me in the news,"" he purportedly wrote. Why people share murder, rape on Facebook . Medina, who lives in South Miami, drove to see his family, to tell them what he did. Then he turned himself in to police, according to his arrest affidavit. He is being held without bond on a preliminary charge of first degree murder, the Miami Dade State Attorney's Office spokesperson told CNN. The court has 21 days to formally charge Medina. Facebook friends commented on the photo in shock. ""That is my friend there."" ""What happened???? derek."" ""WHAT??????"" Other Facebook users reacted with disgust to the posting of the picture of his wife's corpse. She was 26. ""this is crazy omg ... guy kills his wife post pic in facebook."" The disgust did not prevent the commenters from sharing Medina's photo. Again and again. When evidence goes viral . The gruesome image stayed online and was passed along for at least five hours. Facebook was notified of the content and employees removed the picture and disabled Medina's page and that of his deceased wife, according to Facebook. In his note, Medina accused his wife of abusing him and asked his friends for their understanding for what he did to her because of it. The police report with his confession cast a more detailed light on the course of events. This was Medina's account to Miami Dade police: . He and his wife argued. He pulled a gun on her. She threatened to leave him. He put the gun away and followed her. She unloaded a volley of punches on him. He fetched the gun again. She pulled a knife. He wrestled it out of her hands. She punched him again. Then he shot her ""multiple times."" Opinion: The dark side of social media . He felt certain she was dead. He did not call 911, the affidavit states. He changed clothes, and after seeing his family, went to a police station and began the process of confessing. After he gave police his address, they drove to the scene, where they found the body. The couple's 10-year-old daughter was also still in the house, police said. She was physically ""unharmed."" Medina self-published self-help books and maintained a website called EmotionalWriter.com. His books claim to be about ""effective communication"" and ""marriage counseling tips,"" according to the website. ""Derek Medina is an emotional writer. His goal is to save people's lives thru his books he has published,"" the website says. ""My goal is for you, the readers, to open up your eyes and change for the better."" Hours before the slaying, Medina posted a picture of his wife, his daughter and himself having dinner together outdoors at a marina. They were all smiling.","Derek Medina posts a picture of his dead wife's body to Facebook .

"As expected, the Supreme Court has agreed to decide the constitutionality of the sweeping health care reform law championed by President Barack Obama. The justices made their announcement in a brief order issued Monday. Oral arguments are likely to be held in late February or March, with a ruling by June, assuring the blockbuster issue will become a hot-button political debate in a presidential election year. The high court agreed to hear two major questions: whether the law's key provision is unconstitutional, and if so, whether the entire law, with its 450 sections, must be scrapped. Five and a half hours of oral arguments have been scheduled. Other related cases are pending and may also be added to the docket. The largest and broadest legal challenge to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act comes from a joint filing by 26 states, led by Florida. It was that series of appeals the high court accepted for review. At issue is whether the ""individual mandate"" section -- requiring nearly all Americans to buy health insurance by 2014 or face financial penalties -- is an improper exercise of federal authority. The states also say that if that linchpin provision is unconstitutional, the entire law must be also go. Joining Florida in the challenge are Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming. Virginia and Oklahoma have filed separate challenges, along with other groups and individuals opposed to the law. ""We know the Affordable Care Act is constitutional and are confident the Supreme Court will agree,"" said White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer in a news release issued after the court made its announcement. The justices made a calculated call to address the broader issues of the reach of federal authority and the power of Congress to enact this kind of legislation. Toobin: Political implications could be huge . The National Federation of Business, a key player in opposing the law, said it is pleased the court will address the larger issues. ""For the small-business community, this comes not a day too soon,"" said Dan Danner, the group's CEO. ""The health care law has not lived up to its promises of reducing costs, allowing citizens to keep their coverage or improving a cumbersome system that has long been a burden to small-business owners and employees, alike. The small-business community can now have hope; their voices are going to be heard in the nation's highest court."" Many provisions of the law have not yet taken effect, but the White House, in its release, said that under the provisions that have, ""one million more young Americans have health insurance, women are getting mammograms and preventive services without paying an extra penny out of their own pocket, and insurance companies have to spend more of your premiums on health care instead of advertising and bonuses."" Three federal appeals courts have found the PPACA to be constitutional, while another has said it is not, labeling it ""breathtaking in its expansive scope."" That ""circuit split"" all but assured the Supreme Court would step in and decide the matter. Florida and other Republican-led states had urged the high court to intervene. ""This health care law is an affront on Americans' individual liberty, and we will not allow the federal government to violate our constitutional rights,"" said the state's attorney general, Pam Bondi. ""Our country urgently needs a final ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court."" The states say individuals cannot be forced to buy insurance, a ""product"" they may neither want nor need. The Justice Department had countered the states' argument by saying that since every American will need medical care at some point in their lives, individuals do not ""choose"" to participate in the health care market. Federal officials cite 2008 figures of $43 billion in uncompensated costs from the millions of uninsured people who receive health services, costs that are shifted to insurance companies and passed on to consumers. The coalition of states is asking the court to decide three fundamental questions: . --Whether the entire law must fail because its centerpiece -- the individual mandate -- is unconstitutional. --Whether states can be forced by the federal government to expand their share of Medicaid costs and administration, with the risk of losing that funding if they refuse. --Whether state employees can receive a federally mandated level of health insurance coverage. The legislation was heavily promoted by Obama in his first year in office. Supporters say it would extend health coverage to about 30 million Americans. The White House argues the move is good for society and good for the economy. Opponents claim it would overly burden states and small businesses, raise costs, and reduce individual choice. All sides agree the issue needs to be decided soon, with more provisions of the law set to come into effect in coming years. Legal analysts say the health care cases are the biggest to be tackled by the high court in a decade, and will shine new political light on the role of courts to decide these kinds of huge social issues. ""The questions raised here are explosive, a kind of perfect storm for the justices to address in an election year,"" said Thomas Goldstein, a Washington lawyer and founder of Scotusblog. ""It will be impossible to take your eyes away from the Supreme Court. Health care reform, a top Democratic priority since the Truman administration, was passed by the previous Congress in a series of virtually party-line votes. Obama signed the act into law in March 2010. The law is widely considered to be the signature legislative accomplishment of the president's first two years in office. Among other things, the measure was designed to help millions of uninsured and underinsured Americans receive adequate and affordable health care through the government-imposed mandates and subsidies. The federal government stated in court briefs that 45 million Americans last year were without health insurance, roughly 15% of the country's population. Critics have equated the measure to socialized medicine, fearing that a bloated government bureaucracy would result in higher taxes and diminished health care services. Opponents derisively labeled the measure ""Obamacare."" Republican leaders, who captured the House of Representatives in the midterm elections, have vowed to overturn or severely trim the law. The cases accepted Monday are Dept. of Health and Human Services v. Florida (11-398); NFIB v. Sebelius (11-393); and Florida v. HHS (11-400).","The White House says it is confident the law will be found to be constitutional .

"(CNN) -- Border skirmishes between Thailand and Cambodia flared for a second day in an ongoing dispute over an ancient Hindu temple, a Thai military official said Wednesday. There were several exchanges of gunfire overnight, according to Col. Sansern Kaewkumnerd, a Thai military spokesman, who said the exchanges were brief. Some hand grenades were thrown and one Thai soldier was injured, he said. The Asian neighbors have been urged by the U.N. Security Council to end their dispute over Preah Vihear temple. The council issued a statement on Monday, following a closed-door session on the conflict that included representatives from both sides and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). ""The members of the Security Council called on the two sides to display maximum restraint and avoid any action that may aggravate the situation,"" said the statement, read by Ambassador Maria Luiza Ribeiro Viotti of Brazil, which holds the monthly presidency of the 15-member body for February. ""The members of the Security Council further urged the parties to establish a permanent ceasefire and to implement it fully and resolve the situation peacefully and through effective dialogue,"" she said. Border skirmishes, which started earlier this month, have killed five people, including members of the military and civilians, a statement from ASEAN said, adding that each nation accuses the other of firing first. The clashes stem from a longstanding conflict related to the 11th-century Preah Vihear temple. The building sits on a cliff in Cambodian territory, but the most accessible entrance to the site is on the Thai side. In a letter to the United Nations last week, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen said that in addition to the human toll the fighting was taking, the temple had suffered damage. Conflict over the site has taken place periodically for years. In 1962, the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands, ruled that the site was in Cambodia, adding that the structure was ""an outstanding masterpiece of Khmer architecture."" But Thailand says the 1.8-square-mile (4.7-square-kilometer) area around Preah Vihear was never fully demarcated, and blames a map drawn at the beginning of the 20th-century during the French occupation of Cambodia. In July 2008, the United Nations approved Cambodia's application to have the temple listed as a World Heritage Site, meaning the U.N. believes the place has outstanding universal value.

"Ten loveable mutts rescued from the streets of Sochi, Russia, arrived in the United States for adoption Thursday, the result of an international outcry over the plight of stray dogs in the 2014 Winter Olympics host city, organizers said. Sochi animal rescue organizations began bringing in dogs from the streets after reports that they were getting rounded up and poisoned circulated around the Games.  At the time, American skier Gus Kenworthy, an Olympic silver medalist, made headlines when he pledged to bring four street dogs back to the United States after the Games.  Humane Society International worked both on Kenworthy's project and bringing these 10 dogs to the United States. ""These 10 are representative of some of the dogs that have been removed from the streets and are now up for adoption in Sochi,"" said Kelly O'Meara, director of HSI companion animals and engagement. ""They're the sweetest, most interactive, very friendly dogs, very adoptable that just happen to be unfortunate enough to be living on the street."" The group worked with PovoDog Animal Shelter in Sochi and two other organizations to arrange vaccination, documentation and travel for the dogs, who then spent two days in transit. ""These dogs have had a tremendous journey. It's been almost two days of travel for them. They went from Sochi to Moscow, had a long layover in Moscow, and then the flight to Dulles airport today,"" O'Meara said. ""And as you can tell, they have to be pretty chill to handle it like this. And they did. They all did remarkably well."" The dogs will be housed for the time being in the Washington Animal Rescue League facilities in the nation's capital.  Bob Ramin, CEO of the animal league, said the next few days are all about comfort for the animals. ""These animals are seeing a lot of new things and experiencing a lot of new things, so they're kind of stressed out,"" Ramin said. ""We want to make sure they know they're in a safe place so we've got our staff working with them one on one."" Each dog will get a medical evaluation. If all goes well, the dogs could be available for adoption within weeks. ""In the next couple of days, we'll start socializing them, taking them out on walks with other dogs, and really just treating them like other dogs so they can have that socialization and feel safe,"" Ramin said. Organizers say that they expect a great deal of interest in these dogs because the public outcry before, during and after the Games.  More dogs are expected to arrive in the United States for adoption in the coming days.","Reports of stray dogs being killed in Sochi, Russia, before the Olympics fueled public outrage .

"(CNN) -- The United Nations plans to add 2,000 more soldiers to its peacekeeping mission in the Ivory Coast amid escalating violence between supporters of rival politicians. Laurent Gbagbo, the incumbent leader, is defying calls to step down after an electoral commission declared he lost the election in November. The international community -- including the United Nations -- considers challenger Alassane Ouattara the winner of the presidential vote. Ouattara is holed up in a hotel in the main city of Abidjan under the protection of U.N. peacekeepers . Reinforcements will also include three more armed helicopters to help protect civilians, according to a spokesman. ""These helicopters will be used to promote peace and provide protection,"" said Hamadoun Toure, a spokesman for the U.N. mission in the country. The 9,000-strong mission has been in the country for seven years, according to the United Nations. World leaders are concerned that violence from the standoff will cause another civil war, which split the country into a rebel-held north and a government-controlled south in 2002. Last week, at least six were killed when an all-women group protesting the disputed president's refusal to cede power was fired upon. Gbagbo soldiers attacked the group, which was peacefully marching in Abidjan on Thursday, said P.J. Crowley, the U.S. State Department spokesman. Video footage shows women screaming as thunderous gunshots are heard in the background. After the attack, bloodied bodies, flip-flops and tote bags were left scattered on the streets. The disputed president denied his forces were behind the killings, calling it a ""gross manipulation"" of events . About 365 people have been killed since the standoff started in December, the U.N. said. Hundreds of thousands have fled their homes, with about 200,000 leaving the Abidjan area alone since the clashes started. The United Nations refugee agency has warned that its access to people in need of urgent humanitarian aid is becoming impossible amid escalating violence.","It will also add more armed helicopters to its peacekeeping mission .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- A fighter jet was shot down and burst into flames Saturday in the area of Benghazi, Libya. Explosions could also be heard in the city, which has been a stronghold for rebels opposing Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. It was not immediately clear who the fighter jet belonged to. The development is significant, in part, because Benghazi has been considered the center of the opposition forces. The opposition has been pushed back from other cities that it used to have control of, and rebels have vowed to defend Benghazi to the death. A day earlier, the Libyan government said it was abiding by a cease-fire, but witnesses have said violence from pro-Gadhafi forces have continued. Libya late Friday called for international observers to come and verify the cease-fire. One day after the approval of a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force to protect civilians, U.S. President Barack Obama warned Gadhafi to pull back from several besieged cities -- or face military consequences. But Obama insisted that American troops will not be deployed in Libya. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was flying to Paris for a Saturday meeting with European allies and Arab partners . At least 28 people died and hundreds were wounded as fighting raged in the cities of Misrata, Ajdabiya and Zintan on Friday, according to Khaled el-Sayeh, military spokesman for the opposition. Libya's deputy foreign minister called for observers from China, Malta, Turkey and Germany ""to come to Libya as soon as possible ... to make sure that there is a real cease-fire on the ground."" Khaled Kaim also noted that the ""door is open for any other countries to send observers."" Kaim said the media is distorting Libyan military actions and said the country has evidence of ""crimes against humanity conducted by the rebels."" Government forces ""did not cause the deaths of any civilians,"" instead inflicting casualties on armed rebel militias, and will not assault Benghazi, Kaim said. Forces loyal to Gadhafi are honoring a cease-fire and are not fighting a militia group that is making advances in the eastern part of the country, according to Kaim. Rebel forces are advancing on the town of al-Migrun, south of the rebel stronghold of Benghazi, said Kaim. The French press agency AFP confirmed to CNN the movement by a militia group and said it recorded video. Witnesses in the western city of Misrata said earlier Friday that a pro-government assault is persisting and casualties are mounting as countries backing the council's move, such as Britain and France, get their military resources into place to enforce the measure. ""What cease-fire?"" asked a doctor in Misrata, who described hours of military poundings, casualties and dwindling resources to treat the wounded. ""We're under the bombs. ""This morning, they are burning the city,"" the doctor said. ""There are deaths everywhere."" ""Misrata is on fire,"" according to an opposition member, who said tanks and vehicles with heavy artillery shot their way into the city Thursday night and the assault continued Friday. He said Gadhafi's regime announced a cease-fire to buy time for itself. ""Please help us."" Outside Ajdabiya in eastern Libya, CNN's Arwa Damon said she heard explosions, listened to fighters' accounts of heavy casualties and saw ambulances. She said fighters, who don't trust Gadhafi, believe that the declaration is a trick. ""Everybody around us is on very high alert, still expecting the worst,"" Damon said. El-Sayeh said 26 people died in Misrata, 83 were seriously wounded and hundreds were slightly wounded. In Ajdabiya, two died, three were seriously wounded and hundreds were slightly wounded. There was no immediate casualty count for Zintan, el-Sayeh said. CNN couldn't independently confirm the witness accounts, and it is impossible to tell whether word of the cease-fire declaration trickled down to pro-government forces. In remarks televised around the globe, Libyan Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa said in Tripoli that the country decided on ""an immediate cease-fire and the stoppage of all military operations."" He noted that the country, since it is a member of the United Nations, is ""obliged to accept the Security Council resolution that permits the use of force to protect the civilian population."" Obama said Friday that ""left unchecked, we have every reason to believe Gadhafi (will) commit atrocities against his own people"" and the surrounding region could be destabilized. Power and water must be restored to several cities, he added. ""These terms are not negotiable,"" Obama said. If Gadhafi doesn't comply, the U.N. resolution will be imposed through military action, the president said. The U.N. resolution, while not authorizing such a move, does not preclude the United States from arming rebels, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations said Friday. Ambassador Susan Rice told CNN's ""Situation Room"" that the ""U.S. is ready to act"" and that Gadhafi ""should be under no illusions that if he doesn't act immediately he will face swift and sure consequences, including military action."" When asked whether the United States was planning to provide weapons to the opposition, Rice replied, ""We are focused immediately on protection of civilians, on ensuring that the march to Benghazi does not continue and that those who are most vulnerable have the rights and protections that they deserve."" Koussasaid that Libya plans to protect civilians and provide them with humanitarian assistance and that it is obliged to protect all foreigners and their assets. He said the Libya government was disappointed in the imposition of a no-fly zone, arguing that it will hurt the civilian population. He also said the use of military power would violate the country's sovereignty and go against the U.N. charter, but he acknowledged that some countries may yet intervene. ""There are signs this indeed might take place,"" Koussa said. Bernard Valero, a French Foreign Ministry spokesman, said the cease-fire announcement ""does not change the threat on the ground."" ""Gadhafi is privy to folkloric declarations, and we must remain extremely vigilant with regards to these declarations,"" he said. Clinton, who called the situation ""fluid and dynamic,"" said the United States wants actions, not words. ""We will continue to work with our partners in the international community to press Gadhafi to leave and to support the legitimate aspirations of the Libyan people,"" she said. The Libyan government ""must immediately cease all hostilities against the civilian population,"" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Friday in Madrid. Earlier Friday, talk emerged in Europe of speedy military action against Gadhafi's regime. In an interview with RTL radio, French government spokesman Francois Baroin said France plans to participate in ""swift"" efforts. President Nicolas Sarkozy will convene a summit Saturday to look at the crisis. Invited are members of the Arab League, the president of the European Council and representatives of states that support the implementation of the U.N. resolution. British Prime Minister David Cameron said the United Kingdom has started preparations to deploy aircraft, and ""in the coming hours"" they will move to air bases where they will be positioned for any ""necessary action."" Spain will offer NATO the use of two military bases and provide air and naval forces for use in operations involving Libya, Spanish Defense Minister Carme Chacon said Friday in Madrid, a Defense Ministry spokesman said. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Canada is sending CF-18 fighter jets to join a Canadian warship on standby off the coast of Libya. The Pentagon, meanwhile, announced Friday that Defense Secretary Robert Gates will travel to Russia this weekend as the United States and other nations deliberate action against Libya. ""There is no consideration being given to delaying this trip,"" spokesman Geoff Morrell said at the Pentagon. He said Gates maintains constant communications links with Washington wherever he goes and can ""carry out his responsibilities no matter where he is in the world."" Asked whether the cease-fire declaration complicates a U.N.-sanctioned intervention, Michael Rubin, a Middle East expert at the American Enterprise Institute, said, ""It is going to make it tougher without a doubt."" ""One should credit Obama for getting the international community behind him, but it came at the price of momentum. The Libyans understand European weakness and know how to play off of it,"" Rubin said. Rubin said migration concerns come into play, with Europeans worried that more violence will generate more refugees. ""They look at change in North Africa almost exclusively through the lens of migration,"" he said. The council voted 10-0 with five abstentions Thursday night to authorize ""states to take all necessary measures to protect civilians."" It also imposed a no-fly zone, banning all flights in Libyan airspace, with exceptions that involve humanitarian aid and evacuation of foreign nationals. The United States and its NATO partners have severalcontingencies in place to act quickly, according to an administration official familiar with planning. They include airstrikes and cruise missile attacks designed to cripple Libyan air defenses and punish the military units that are leading Gadhafi's push on opposition strongholds in the east, the official said. The opposition, with devoted but largely untrained and under-equipped units, has suffered military setbacks this week. But their hopes were buoyed by the U.N. vote, particularly in rebel-held Benghazi, where an assault by pro-Gadhafi forces has been expected. The resolution singles out the city. It says U.N. member states can ""take all necessary measures ... to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, including Benghazi, while excluding a foreign occupation force. ""The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya"" is a formal name for the nation.

"Washington (CNN) -- A spokeswoman for James Clapper said the embattled director of national intelligence stands by remarks he made Thursday ""about the current military situation in Libya"" that prompted a leading Republican senator to call for his resignation. The Obama administration also said Clapper still has its ""full faith and confidence."" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, issued a statement criticizing Clapper's testimony, made during a committee hearing earlier in the day, that Moammar Gadhafi's regime would ""prevail"" over rebels seeking to oust the 68-year-old dictator from power in Libya. ""His comments will make the situation more difficult for those opposing Gadhafi,"" said Graham, adding they undercut U.S. efforts and should not have been made in a public forum. Graham cited two previous occasions in which Clapper made misstatements, and said his comments on the Libya situation ""should be the final straw."" Jamie Smith, director of public affairs for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, said that Clapper's testimony ""provided a snapshot of the relative strengths and weaknesses of the regime and the opposition. As he stated in his testimony, the situation in Libya is very fluid."" ""Many factors will come into play over time including the pressure being brought to bear by the international community as well as the Libyan people's clear desire for change,"" Smith said. ""As this dynamic situation evolves, the Intelligence Community will continue to provide its best assessment of the current situation as well as identify opportunities that project into the future."" Clapper's comment on Libya was not the only one that got him in trouble with some members of the armed services committee. In an exchange with Democratic Sens. Carl Levin of Michigan and Joe Manchin of West Virginia over what nation posed the greatest threat to the United States, the director focused his responses on the chief nuclear rivals, China and Russia, rather than on the regimes in North Korea and Iran, which are openly belligerent. Clapper went on to clarify his answer, to which Levin gave lukewarm acceptance, but later Thursday, Senate Intelligence Chairman Dianne Feinstein, D-California, called the director's response on the threat issue ""a problem"" and, when asked by CNN, pointedly declined to say she had confidence in him. ""On the question on the two nations with the greatest intent to harm ours, I do not believe they're China and Russia,"" said Feinstein, who was not at the hearing. ""I don't understand why that was put out there. So, that's a problem."" Asked whether Clapper has problems communicating, Feinstein responded, ""I don't know what it is and I'm not going to speculate, but clearly there's a problem ... I would like the opportunity to look more deeply into it, OK?"" Other senators, including John McCain, R-Arizona, and Joseph Lieberman, a Connecticut independent who caucuses with Democrats, expressed support for Clapper. McCain said the director was ""doing a very fine job."" White House press secretary Jay Carney defended Clapper and said his words were misinterpreted. ""If you look closely at the transcript of what Director Clapper said, he was answering a question with regard to military capacity,"" Carney said. ""Obviously, Russia and China are two of the three largest nuclear powers in the world, therefore they have dangerous weapons and they have the capacity, but he made clear that we do not view Russia and China as a threat."" And in a follow-up answer regarding Clapper's Libya statement, Carney said Graham's response ""was based on a real misinterpretation of what Director Clapper said today."" Asked if the president still had confidence in Clapper, Carney said, ""Yes, full faith and confidence."" In a conference-call phone briefing Thursday night, National Security Adviser Tom Donilon said he believed Clapper ""was presenting a kind of a flat-out resources analysis"" of the situation in Libya. ""He went through the kind of equipment and resources that the regime has."" Donilon said. ""And I think if you look at it, he said from a standpoint of attrition, if you do an attrition analysis, you get to his conclusion."" In the same conference call, Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes addressed the issue of specific adversary nations, saying the issue is ""a matter of capability (in the case of China and Russia) versus intent"" to be a U.S. adversary ""that leads you to focus on nations such as North Korea, organizations such as al Qaeda, who again are a great focus of what we do here every day."" That seemed to be the thrust of Clapper's protracted exchange on Thursday after Manchin asked Clapper what nations he thought posed the greatest threat to the United States. Clapper said Russia and China posed a mortal threat, citing their nuclear arsenals and military capabilities. But he added that he didn't think either nation had the intent to strike the United States. That clearly was not the answer Levin expected.. ""You didn't mention Iran or North Korea, which would have been the first two countries I would have thought of in response to that question,"" the committee chairman. ""I was really kind of taken aback almost by your answer."" Clapper explained that he interpreted the question to be what countries pose a ""mortal threat"" to the United States. ""Iran and North Korea are, you know of great concern. I don't know at this point in time they pose a direct mortal threat to the continental United States,"" he said. Levin pressed Clapper on whether Russia and China were a direct mortal threat to the United States, and Clapper reiterated that they both had the capability, but it was unlikely they had the intent. Levin then flipped the question: ""By that measure we represent the direct mortal threat to both of them, right?"" Clapper seemed to avoid a direct answer but eventually answered yes. Manchin stepped in to to see if he could clarify Clapper's position by asking which nation has the intent to be the greatest adversary. Clapper answered, ""Probably China,"" which once again set Levin off. ""I'm just as surprised by that answer as I was by your first answer,"" Levin said. Clapper tried to explain that he was ""loath"" to pick one country and restated that both China and Russia have the capability, but he didn't think either had the intent. Levin suggested Clapper needs to be more careful with his words. ""When the Director of National Intelligence talks about what are the greatest threats, unless he starts with capabilities, and uses that, and doesn't just answer 'China and Russia' the way he did -- I was concerned by the answer."" After the hearing, Levin issued a statement saying, ""I was taken aback by Director Clapper's statement about China and Russia and, frankly, I was surprised by how long it took him to correct the impression that he created. He did finally correct it, however, and I am glad that he did, and I am satisfied with his correction."" This isn't the first time Clapper has had to explain comments he has made. He was called on the carpet last month for referring to the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt as a secular organization at another Congressional hearing. And during an interview with ABC News in December 2010, Clapper appeared unaware of a terrorist plot that had been interrupted in Britain earlier in the day. In both cases, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence put out statements on Clapper's behalf. In the instance of the ABC News interview, the office said the director had not been briefed on the UK terror plot.","NEW: Spokeswoman says Clapper is standing by his comments on Libya .

"(CNN) -- As Western leaders gather in Newport, Wales, for this week's NATO summit, the Ukrainian army is taking a pounding from Russia-supported rebel fighters in the country's east and south. The central question now confronting President Barack Obama and colleagues is whether to supply Kiev with heavy arms. So far, Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the two key decision makers, have been reluctant. But with Ukrainian forces reeling before what many are calling an overt Russian invasion, pressure is growing on them to reconsider. Already NATO has announced plans to strengthen the defense of its frontline members in the Baltics and Eastern Europe. The alliance is planning to create a rapid reaction force, made up of 4,000 troops, to respond within hours to any future Russian incursion. Whether that will be enough to deter President Vladimir Putin, it will not help Ukraine, which is not a NATO member. Under fierce attack from the rebels, supported now by up to 2,000 Russian troops, the Ukrainian army has been reduced in recent days from seeking victory to merely trying to avoid defeat. To fight back, it needs anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons, drones, spare parts, fuel -- and, most of all, intelligence and strategic advice from Western military planners. Should NATO -- or just the U.S. -- oblige? There are powerful arguments on both sides. Equipping Kiev with greater firepower might well provoke an escalation from Russia, whose forces grossly outnumber those of Ukraine. To send more arms into a war zone is cynical if it will merely increase the scale of killing without any realistic prospect of ending the conflict. Both Obama and Merkel believe their current strategy of graduated economic sanctions will bear fruit in the longer run. Unwilling to contemplate direct military involvement, they worry about getting dragged in inadvertently. Yet to refuse the kind of military support that might enable Kiev to reclaim its eastern territories would allow Putin's violation of the principle of state sovereignty to stand, at least for now. The international order depends upon respect for borders and a rejection of territorial conquest. The world is watching. China is surely monitoring events in Ukraine closely as it sizes up the South China Sea. Iran may take comfort from the West's divisions as it negotiates over its nuclear program. North Korea may be tempted to disregard U.S. warnings. And if Putin perceives his Ukrainian gambit to have worked, this may embolden him to push further. The other day, he appeared to boast to European officials that he ""could take Kiev in two weeks."" Four times in a row, Putin has upped the ante in the face of Western rhetorical and economic pressure. He sent special forces into Crimea, then annexed the region to Russia, then engineered the rebellion in the east, then, more recently, dramatically increased military support. In between -- and especially whenever the West looked ready to act -- he floated ""peace proposals"" and ""ceasefires"" that have always come to nothing. A new ""Seven Point Plan"" revealed on Wednesday may or may not turn out to be something more serious. With more than 750,000 active-duty forces, Moscow's military superiority over Kiev is obvious. But would Putin choose to escalate if the rebels faced a better-armed adversary? Of course, a complete defeat of Moscow's proxies would be embarrassing. But more direct Russian involvement would also carry domestic costs. At present, Putin's ratings at home are off the charts -- 84% approved of his actions in the latest independent, Moscow-based Levada Center poll. Yet, at the same time, the surveys show the post-Crimea euphoria to be fading and doubts about military engagement growing. Since March, the percentage of Russians who say they would ""support the Russian leadership in the situation of an open military conflict between Russia and Ukraine"" has fallen from 74% to 41%. That's less than the 43% who now say they would not support this. The share favoring the incorporation of eastern Ukraine into Russia has fallen from 35% in April to 21% in mid-August. Russians remain delighted by the annexation of Crimea. But the proportion that say they are ready to bear at least some of the economic cost associated with the territory's incorporation has fallen from 59% in March to 50% today. Fighting a disorganized and poorly equipped adversary, Putin can have it both ways. He can keep support to the separatist rebels relatively limited and covert, while denying to the public back home that Russia is involved at all. All this is not to say that Putin would stand by if the West sent arms to Kiev. He may feel strong enough to disregard the hints of growing public anxiety. Nor is it clear that additional weapons would turn the tide. To win the war, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko needs to build a more effective state, introduce economic reforms and offer potentially loyal citizens of Eastern Ukraine a comprehensive deal that recognizes their minority rights and -- while excluding the thugs and Russian agents that have streamed across the border -- gives local Ukrainians some real autonomy. For the leaders in Newport, this will remain a tough call. But the argument for arming Kiev is stronger than it has ever been. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Daniel Treisman.","Daniel Treisman: Ukraine is much weaker than Russia, needs aid to hold its own .

"The United States is preparing to announce a decision ""in the coming days"" on assistance to Egypt, the White House said Tuesday, and U.S. officials told CNN military aid will be cut, though not all of it. The announcement comes in the wake of the July coup against President Mohamed Morsy and the turmoil that has followed as recently as this week, one U.S. official said Tuesday. However, some military aid could continue, including funds to uphold Egypt's obligations under its peace treaty with Israel, and money for counterterrorism and security in Sinai, where extremists have been able to set up base, according to a senior U.S. official. The United States will also maintain nonmilitary funding that helps democracy promotion, the official said. In an initial report about the announcement, CNN did not specify that these portions of the aid would continue. Mohamed Morsy gets trial date as Egypt turmoil continues . The Obama administration withheld some military aid to Egypt in August. Another U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the move to suspend assistance -- more than $1 billion is given each year -- has been prompted by an ""accumulation of events,"" including recent violence against protesters, dozens of whom were killed over the weekend. The United States has not yet notified the Egyptians of the decision to cut off military aid, a senior official said. The announcement is not expected to be made on Wednesday and has already been pushed back a few times, the official said. In a statement late Tuesday, National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said an announcement is coming soon but denied the United States is ""halting all military assistance."" ""We will announce the future of our assistance relationship with Egypt in the coming days, but as the president made clear at UNGA, that assistance relationship will continue,"" Hayden said in a statement. Any decision to cut aid would not preclude resuming the aid should Egypt make what the United States believes are positives steps towards restoring democracy, officials said. Death toll rises as violence rages . U.S. national security advisers recommended to the president last month that aid should be cut, U.S. officials told CNN in September. The recommendation, officials said, was made in a ""principals meeting"" of the president's national security team, including National Security Adviser Susan Rice, Secretary of State John Kerry and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel. The meeting was the culmination of months of debate within the administration about how to respond to the July 3 ouster of Morsy, Egypt's first democratically elected leader. In addition to the suspension of some military aid earlier this year, there has also been a severe slowdown in military shipments from the United States to Egypt, including F-16s. The Obama administration has not labeled Morsy's removal from office a coup. Such a designation would require a cut in all but humanitarian aid. In the past, the White House has said it was in U.S. national security interests to keep the aid intact. But after U.S. calls to the Egyptian military for restraint over the last few months were met with a heavy-handed crackdown on Morsy supporters, Obama canceled a joint military exercise and announced a new review of U.S. aid to Egypt. Last month, U.S. officials said Obama's national security team had recommended a cut in aid that included all foreign military financing to the Egyptian military, except funding toward security in the Sinai Peninsula and along the Egyptian border with Gaza. ""This has been coming for quite a while, actually, and President Obama signaled that the United States was slowing down aid to Egypt in his address at the United Nations just a couple of weeks ago,"" said Robin Wright, an Arab affairs analyst at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. ""The United States has become increasingly disillusioned with the way that the military leadership has cracked down on its own people. Over 1,000 died in the early weeks after the military coup, and in the past week, you've seen dozens more killed in confrontations."" CNN senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman said in the short-term, the U.S. decision could have a positive impact on the Egyptian government. ""Immediately, probably, the Egyptian government is going to find it's going to gain somewhat in terms of local public opinion,"" Wedeman said. ""Egyptians I've already been in touch with about this decision or announcement from the United States that it's going to cut aid seem to react positively. There seems to be a lot of frustration with the United States, given its role in Egypt over the last 2½ years since the revolution."" But don't expect to see Egypt's military hurting financially, Wedeman said. ""For the Egyptian government, a cutoff in U.S. aid is symbolically significant, but in terms of the actual amount of money they're getting, it will not make a big difference,"" he said. Wedeman said that's because Gulf states have been pouring billions of dollars into Egypt since Morsy's ouster. A move to cut off aid would likely anger those Gulf allies who have urged the United States to support the military and warned against stopping assistance.

"A few months before the Boston bombings, the suspected mastermind of the terror attack, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, wanted to change his name, a U.S. government official told CNN Wednesday. Tsarnaev, who was shot and killed in a massive manhunt, made an interesting choice for his new name. He wrote that he wanted to switch his first name to Muaz, the last name of Emir Muaz -- a Dagestan insurgent fighting in the Caucasus region of Russia, the official added. Muaz was killed in 2009. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the big brother of accused bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, filed that request with U.S. immigration on January 23, 2013, as part of his application to become a naturalized U.S. citizen.  His brother, Dzhokhar, had already become a naturalized citizen. ""We don't know why,"" the official says. ""There's no evidence why he wanted to change his name."" Whether it was another indication of his radicalization that led to the marathon bombing is speculation, according to the source. The story was first reported in the Wednesday edition of the Los Angeles Times. The year before the April 15, 2013, bombing, Tamerlan Tsarnaev traveled to the restive Dagestan region, hoping to meet with Canadian boxer-turned-jihadist William Plotnikov. Russian troops killed Plotnikov in July 2012 while Tsarnaev was in the region. It's unclear whether the two men ever came face to face. Tsarnaev flew out of Dagestan two days after Plotnikov was killed and investigators have been looking into whether Tsarnaev left because of Plotnikov's death, according to another source briefed on the investigation. Authorities also have been investigating whether Tsarnaev had any contact with another militant, Mahmoud Mansur Nidal. The 18-year-old was killed by Russian forces in May 2012 during a gun battle in Makhachkala, Dagestan's capital. As part of the naturalization process, a form requires a signature acknowledging the applicant will swear allegiance to the United State and might be required to serve in the military. Instead, the official says Tsarnaev printed his first and last name, but crossed out ""Tamerlan"" and changed it to ""Muaz."" According to the website www.thinkbabynames.com, the name Tamerlan is derived from Tamerlane, the feared 14th-century warrior who conquered parts of the Middle East and Central Asia. Tamerlane, the name used in the epic Edgar Allan Poe poem, is now more commonly called Timur by historians. Four things we've learned about the Boston bombings .

"A senior European Union official met with Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych on Friday, amid an uneasy political stalemate after days of clashes between police and protesters. Opposition leaders have demanded the resignation of the government and early elections. Yanukovych's presidential website reported his meeting with Commissioner for EU Enlargement Stefan Fule but gave no detail of what was discussed. Boxer-turned-opposition leader Vitali Klitschko said outside mediation was needed if any progress is to be made in talks between the opposition and government. ""International mediators must be involved in any discussion of the crisis in Ukraine,"" he said. ""Yanukovych decided to declare war on his own people rather than stop the confrontation and approach resolving the situation with common sense. He tries to keep power at a price of blood and destabilize the country. He must be stopped."" Yanukovych and opposition leaders held a second round of talks Thursday, but they broke up without a resolution. Both parties decided to keep talking, however. Resolving the crisis, insists Klitschko, hinges on talks with the EU, especially with Fule. ""Yesterday minimal steps were proposed. They cannot solve the crisis. That is why such proposals outraged people. At first, they demanded Interior Minister Zaharchenko and (Prime Minister Mykola) Azarov's government to resign, but now the core demand is resignation of the President. But he pretends as if nothing is happening,"" Klitschko said. In a Twitter post, the EU said foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton and a European Parliament delegation are also planning to travel to Ukraine next week. Meanwhile, anti-government protesters worked Friday morning to strengthen barricades set up in central Kiev streets and seized a ministry building, Ukraine's official Ukrinform news agency reported. Ukrainian Interior Minister Vitaliy Zakharchenko said early Friday that if protesters left the street where the violence has been focused, police would not seek to prosecute them. He also promised police would not use force against those rallying in Kiev's Independence Square, or Maidan. Police torture claims . Claims of abuses by security forces have emerged. A video posted to YouTube, showing a protester made to strip naked apart from his shoes and kicked by police as he enters a van, has been widely circulated on Ukrainian media. Ukraine's Interior Ministry has apologized for the behavior of those shown in the footage and says it is investigating the incident. A 17-year-old who says he was taking pictures of the protests, Myhaylo Nyskohuz, told CNN he was tortured after he was seized by Ukraine's riot police, or Berkut. ""They beat me on my legs and ankles, they sprayed my whole body with pepper spray and made me lie naked and sing the national anthem,"" he said, looking battered and bruised. ""They stripped me and took me through a live corridor of around 40 or 50 riot police, and each one of them beat me."" Nyskohuz's arm was broken, and he was stabbed in the thigh. Meanwhile, Yanukovych told a gathering of religious leaders that police were acting lawfully. ""Today, the law enforcement bodies are working within their power, within the laws that oblige them to keep order,"" he said. He continued to call for the opposition to ""sit down at the negotiating table."" He further said that anyone who had participated in rallies, but not committed a crime, would get amnesty. ""We agreed yesterday that after the parliament adopts the law on amnesty, all the people detained in the course of these actions, including the radical ones, but who haven't committed serious crimes, will be amnestied,"" the President said. Prime minister: Officers told to act within the law . Prime Minister Mykola Azarov declined Thursday to apologize for the violence unfolding during the Kiev protests and told CNN's Richard Quest that law enforcement officers acted within the law. Asked about Nyskohuz's case, Azarov replied: ""Well, first of all, the law enforcement officers were given instructions and orders to act within the legislation and not to use any kind of weapon. ""They do not have firearms with them, and those preliminary actions which they have to take -- when someone is trying, for example, to capture government buildings and institutions -- all those measures are not just analogical to those used in all the European states."" Police were merely responding to an effort to overthrow the government, Azarov said, adding that Ukraine was not in Russia's pocket. Nyskohuz now faces a series of detention hearings to determine whether he will be jailed for taking part in the protests. The Interior Ministry said Friday that 281 policemen have been injured since the violence erupted Sunday. And as the protest movement spreads beyond the capital, 58 protesters were detained in Cherkasy, a city in central Ukraine, during an attempt to take over the regional state administration office, the ministry said. 'No to his resignation' The protests flared into violence Sunday as protesters braved the freezing cold to voice their anger about sweeping new anti-protest laws approved by parliament last week. Hundreds of protesters heard directly from Klitschko after the opposition talks with the President, which lasted more than four hours Thursday. ""He said no to his resignation and Cabinet resignation,"" Klitschko told opposition supporters.  ""It does not make sense to negotiate with someone who intends to cheat."" The sharp rhetoric was echoed by the President's press office, which issued a statement after the talks. ""Unfortunately, for the second time, leaders of the opposition refused to declare the statement condemning extremist actions,"" it said. The President's statement went on to say that ""negotiations will be continued."" Sweeping anti-protest laws . The clashes are an escalation of weeks of largely peaceful public protests prompted by Yanukovych's decision in November to spurn a planned trade deal with the European Union and turn toward Russia instead. The controversial protest laws have sparked concerns they could be used to put down demonstrations and deny people the right to free speech. They include provisions barring people from wearing helmets and masks to rallies, from setting up tents or sound equipment without prior police permission, and from traveling in convoys of more than five vehicles without authorization. The protests have unfolded since November 21, when Yanukovych changed his stance on the EU trade pact, which had been years in the making. The demonstrators say an EU agreement would open borders to trade and set the stage for modernization and inclusion. Ukraine's government says the terms needed to be renegotiated to protect Ukrainians better.","EU Commissioner Stefan Fule meets with President Viktor Yanukovych .

"One of the nation's most prestigious teams of flying aerobats dive-bombed into the depths of sexual harassment and stayed there for at least a year, a new Navy study says. Under the command of Capt. Gregory McWherter, members of the Blue Angels openly passed around pornography and flew with it in their cockpits during airshows. They cursed gays and spread dirty talk about women. Their chauvinistic behavior turned the squadron into a hostile workplace, a Navy investigation into the shenanigans said. And McWherter not only tolerated them; he set examples of bad behavior and animated those under his command. McWherter was reprimanded after a disciplinary proceeding this week and was previously relieved of his duties as an executive officer.

The Blue Angels are the friendly face of the U.S. Navy and Marines and put on aerial stunt shows before live audiences across the country most every week. The scandal has sullied their reputation and that of the military branches they represent, Navy investigators said. Giant genital graffiti . At one point during McWherter's stint, an oversized penis painted in the blue and gold colors of the Blue Angels adorned the roof of an airplane hangar. The image was so large that it could be seen by satellites and appeared on Google Maps images. A member of the squadron painted over the graffiti, and the satellite map image has since disappeared. McWherter has not always had a reputation for raunch. He led the Blue Angels twice, and the first time around, he snuffed out such risque stunts as a matter of maintaining professional order, the investigation said. He completed a ""successful and unmarred tour as the Commanding Officer of the Blue Angels from 2008 to 2010,"" the Navy said. Once that tour was over, he handed over the reins, but his successor committed a safety violation in May 2011. The Angels had to cancel a show and go through a safety stand-down. The commander stepped down, and McWherter returned. He received a ""hero's welcome"" and decided he'd do something to cheer the Angels up: throw out some protocol and crank up camaraderie. Tolerating chauvinism . McWherter was not the first to introduce lewd practices to the squadron, but he no longer clamped down as much and sometimes participated. Pornography had made its way into the squadron around the time the captain's first command ended, the investigation said. ""Both male and female crew chiefs cut out and placed the pornography in the cockpits,"" it said. During the investigation, the practice was cited by some witnesses as ""motivational."" It was seen as a way of building trust among team members. Most of the pictures were depictions of naked women. Crew members who objected could complain and opt out, but some felt under pressure not to do so, the review said. Eventually, tensions over the pictures rose, and McWherter asked two female team members for their opinion, the investigation said. They told him they would feel more comfortable if the photos used were of women in bikinis and not nudes. McWherter complied. But eventually, he received an anonymous letter complaining about that practice, too, and he canned it -- but reportedly not without complaining to team members about someone having sent the letter. Online porn and scorn . But porn crept into more than just the cockpits and the Ready Room. The group set up a site on the online service GroupMe for scheduling purposes, and profanity and porn dotted the posts. McWherter saw them and joined in. ""His initial post after joining the forum was ""f*** you,"" the investigation said. When pornographic images didn't show up in the feed for a while, the captain called for members to post more of them. And he joined in raucous commenting on the lewd images. A Facebook photo of a female enlisted member of the squadron in a bikini turned up in the Ready Room, and McWherter did not object to it. Juvenile to hostile . When investigators showed officers who had served during the captain's first stint as commanding officer examples of the homophobic humor on maps, raunchy jokes and pornography that became common during his second stint, they were shocked. ""These officers unanimously indicated that such material would not have been tolerated during their time under Captain McWherter at the Blue Angels,"" the investigation said. In November 2012, the captain's command ended; he moved on, and his successor inherited a cleanup job. The Navy set up awareness training from various equal opportunity programs to rid the Blue Angels of the smut. In 2014, a service member filed a complaint against McWherter for his lax handling of the harassing atmosphere during his command. Navy investigators concluded that the former commander had allowed what may have seemed like juvenile behavior descend into a ""toxic"" atmosphere.

"Iranian and International Atomic Energy Agency officials jointly said Sunday that Iran has agreed to take seven more steps by May to ease international concern over Tehran's nuclear program. The move, described on the website of the United Nations watchdog group, could be a sign that there has been genuine progress toward achieving a permanent nuclear agreement between Iran and six world powers, including the United States. The parties will start negotiating February 18 in Vienna. The seven steps that Iran agreed to over the weekend with IAEA officials will be implemented by May 15, 2014, according to the IAEA. First, Iran will provide ""mutually agreed relevant information and managed access"" to the Saghand mine in Yazd, which will give an accounting for the mining and refinement of uranium. Second, Iran will provide information and ""managed access"" to the Ardakan concentration plant. Tehran agreed to show updated design information and oblige the IAEA's safety recommendations for the IR-40 reactor. That's a heavy-water reactor at Arak, which is of concern because it can be used to produce plutonium. Also, Iran agreed to give information about and allow inspectors to visit Lashkar Ab'ad Laser Centre and provide information on various source material. The IAEA will also get information and explanations to help it assess Iran's desire to develop Exploding Bridgewire detonators, which trigger reactions in explosive materials.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Comedian Katt Williams on Saturday partly walked back an apology for making insensitive remarks to a Mexican member of his audience, telling CNN that he is not sorry for what he said, but apologizes to anyone who thought he was being hateful. ""I meant what I said and I said what I meant,"" Williams said, referring to his back-and-forth with a heckler during a performance a week ago. A written statement apologizing for the remarks had been released by his publicist on his behalf this week, but the comedian said that it didn't come from him. Video of the exchange, delivered during a performance at the Celebrity Theater in Phoenix, was posted online. Williams singled out a man seated near the stage and asked him if he was Mexican. ""Do you remember when white people used to say 'Go back to Africa,' and we'd have to tell them we don't want to? So if you love Mexico, (expletive), get the (expletive) over there!"" Williams said to the man. It turned into a back-and-forth profanity-laced argument with the man, Williams exclaimed, ""We were slaves, (expletive). You just work like that as landscapers."" On Saturday, Williams said the man started heckling him first with an expletive aimed at the United States. ""If a person starts their heckling with 'f' America, then that gives me the right to defend my country,"" Williams said. ""I don't think I need to apologize for being pro-American."" Williams, an African-American comedian known more for his erratic behavior than his jokes in recent months, said that he can't be anti-Mexican because many of them are his fans. ""The guy said that all of (Arizona) is still Mexico, and I was giving him geography,"" Williams said. The conversation was with the one man and not with the rest of the crowd, he said. ""If I had disrespected Mexicans, I wouldn't have been able to get out of there alive,"" he said. One Arizona activist, Rev. Jarrett Maupin, had called Williams' words ""borderline hate speech and racially offensive."" Maupin had accepted the written apology and called on the comedian to return to Arizona to show his commitment to the Latino community, much like comedian Tracy Morgan's return to Nashville, Tennessee, this summer to personally apologize for anti-gay remarks in a stand-up show there. But Williams told CNN that as a comic, he cannot apologize for his uncensored thoughts during a show. ""That's for the Tracy Morgans of the world,"" he said.","Williams was criticized for anti-Mexican remarks during a show .

"Philip Seymour Hoffman's last wish for his son was that he grow up in New York, Chicago or San Francisco, according to the late actor's will. Hoffman, who died of a heroin overdose earlier this month, left his entire estate to ""friend and companion"" Mimi O'Donnell, who is the mother of his three children, according to the document released by the Manhattan Surrogate's Court Wednesday. It was signed by Hoffman in October 2004, when his son, Cooper, now 10, was just a year old and before daughters Tallulah and Willa were born. ""It is my strong desire, and not direction to my guardian, that my son, Cooper Hoffman be raised and reside in or near the borough of Manhattan in the State of New York, or Chicago Illinois, or San Francisco, California,"" Hoffman stated in the 13-page will. That provision was in a section that applied only if O'Donnell was not living at the time of his death and if a guardian was to be appointed for his children. If living in his preferred three cities was not possible, Hoffman requested that his son at least visit there twice a year. ""The purpose of this request is so that my son will be exposed to the culture, arts and architecture that such cities offer,"" Hoffman's will said. Noticeably absent from his list is Los Angeles, given Hoffman's fame as a Hollywood actor. Hoffman named O'Donnell as his estate's trustee and executrix of his will. Hoffman, 46, was found on the bathroom floor of his apartment, a needle in his arm. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Investigators discovered close to 50 envelopes of what they believed was heroin in the apartment, law enforcement sources said. They also found used syringes, prescription drugs and empty plastic bags of a type commonly used to hold drugs, the sources said. Hoffman, who was nominated for Academy Awards four times, won the Oscar for best actor in 2006 for his portrayal of writer Truman Capote in ""Capote."" He earned Academy Award nominations for roles in ""Charlie Wilson's War,"" ""Doubt,"" and ""The Master.""","Philip Seymour Hoffman died of a heroin overdose earlier this month .

"Turkey's leader accused France of ""genocide"" last century during the war in Algeria, a ratcheting up of rhetoric over controversial French legislation that would criminalize any public denial of what the bill calls the Armenian genocide last century in Ottoman Turkey. ""In Algeria, an estimated 15 percent of the population had been subjected to the massacre of French from 1945 on.  This is genocide,"" Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said during a conference in Istanbul on Friday. ""Algerians were burnt en masse in ovens. They were martyred mercilessly.  If French President Mr. (Nicolas) Sarkozy does not know about this genocide, he should ask his father Paul Sarkozy.  His father Paul Sarkozy served as a soldier in the French legion in Algeria in 1940s."" Once a French colony, guerrillas in the North African nation fought a bloody war against French rule from 1954 to 1962. The French Foreign Ministry shot back, saying ""we deplore excessive use of formulas and personal attacks that do not meet up to the standards of our mutual interest and of our relations. France recalls that it assumes with clarity and transparency its duty to remember the tragedies that have marked its history."" At the same time, it cited Foreign Minister Alain Juppe's call for ""measure and restraint,"" which, he said, ""are more than ever necessary under the current circumstances."" Turkey is angered over the bill, passed by the French National Assembly on Thursday and now under review by the French Senate. Immediately after the vote, Erdogan announced that Turkey is reviewing its ties with France. He said Turkey is recalling its Paris ambassador to Ankara for consultations, is canceling bilateral visits, and won't cooperate with France in joint projects within the European Union. It is also halting ""political consultations"" with France, stopping bilateral military activities and joint exercises, and canceling permission granted annually for all military overflights, landings and take-offs. Erdogan hopes the Senate fails to pass the so-called Armenian genocide bill but he warns that if it does, Turkey will initiate more measures toward France. The Turkish-Armenian controversy over the massacres of last century has reverberated wherever diaspora communities representing both groups exist. Armenian groups and many scholars argue that starting in 1915, Turks committed genocide, when more than a million ethnic Armenians were massacred in the waning days of the Ottoman Empire. The Republic of Armenia has hailed the French move. But modern-day Turkey officially denies that a genocide took place, arguing instead that hundreds of thousands of Armenian Christians and Muslim Turks died in intercommunal violence around the bloody battlefields of World War I. Sarkozy, speaking on TV from the Czech Republic capital of Prague, explained that his country doesn't need an OK from another nation to develop its policies. He was attending the funeral of late Czech leader Vaclav Havel. ""In every circumstance we must remain cool headed and calm. France alone determines its politics. France does not ask for authorization. France has convictions: human rights,  the respect for history. Every country must make the effort to revisit its past. France does not give lessons to anyone nor does it receive lessons from anyone,"" Sarkozy said. Saying that  five million Muslims in live in France, Erdogan noted the ""dangerous dimensions that racism, discrimination and animosity against Muslims reached in France and Europe. French President Sarkozy got the ambition to win the elections with animosity against Turks and Muslims and unfortunately he doesn't refrain from playing such dangerous games."" Turkey and France are NATO allies, and, according to official Turkish statistics, the volume of trade between Turkey and France from January to the end of October this year was more than $13.5 billion. The genocide debate is an annual source of tension between Turkey and the United States, also two NATO allies.  The White House, for example, annually beats back efforts in Congress to pass a resolution which would formally recognize the 1915 massacre of Armenians as genocide.","The Foreign Ministry slams 'personal attacks'

"(CNN)In the climactic final battle in the 1986 movie ""Top Gun,"" an officer tells Stinger, the battle commander, that the aircraft carrier's catapults are broken and it's unable to launch planes. Stinger asks how long a fix will take. ""It'll take 10 minutes,"" the officer replies. ""Bull---- 10 minutes! This thing will be over in two minutes! Get on it!"" Stinger says. Fast-forward to 2015, and the fate of the carrier in ""Top Gun"" is in similar peril. The USS Ranger, decommissioned by the Navy in 1993, is scheduled to be towed from storage in Bremerton, Washington, to a wrecking yard in Texas in about a month. Coming in with a bid to save it is Top Gun Super Carrier of Long Beach, which hopes to stop the carrier's final journey in the California port city, with hopes to turn it into a tourist and business destination. ""Right now, we just want a stay of execution,"" Michael B. Shanahan, project manager for the Long Beach rescue effort, said in a statement on a Change.org petition to save the carrier. ""This is our last chance to stop the loss of an irreplaceable cultural and historic asset."" That chance appears to be slim. In December, the Navy paid International Shipbreaking of Brownsville, Texas, a penny to take the 56,000-ton warship off its hands. The shipbreaker makes its profit by selling the parts of the ship for scrap. Although the Ranger was decommissioned in 1993, the Navy kept it around for possible reactivation until March 2004, when it was stricken from the Naval Register and made available for donation to a group that could preserve it. An attempt by the USS Ranger Foundation to turn the carrier into a museum in Oregon fell short financially, and it could not figure out a way to get the huge ship up the Columbia River to Fairview, Oregon, according to a Navy statement. When it finalized the contract to scrap the Ranger in December, the Navy said it could not afford to maintain it indefinitely while waiting for a suitable organization to take it over. Shanahan said the Top Gun group will cover all costs to keep the Ranger from the scrapyard. ""Sparing the ship now presents NO financial risk to the federal government,"" he said in a statement. The group says it has secured $14 million in donations so far and will cover the $200,000 in annual maintenance costs until a permanent berth for the ship is found, according to a story in the Long Beach Post. But Chris Johnson, a spokesman for Naval Sea Systems Command, which was responsible for disposing of the carrier, told the Navy Times that the Top Gun plan wouldn't pass muster. ""We cannot take private funding for inherently military purposes, so it's not accurate when the group says it can raise funds to keep the ship on donation hold,"" the Navy Times quoted Johnson as saying. So unless another plan comes together quickly, the Ranger is likely to follow two of its predecessors in the Forrestal class of carriers -- the Forrestal and the Saratoga -- to scrapyards in Brownsville. Another carrier, the USS Constellation, part of the Kitty Hawk class, was towed to Brownsville late last year. Like the Ranger, the Constellation was stored in Washington and because of its size had to be towed all the way around the southern tip of South America, as it would not fit through the Panama Canal. The Ranger's final journey is expected to take four to five months, the Navy says. The Ranger spent more than 35 years on active service, including missions off Vietnam and in support of Operation Desert Storm.","The USS Ranger was featured in the 1986 movie ""Top Gun""

"Vilified by the international community for his government's attitude on gay rights, Russian president Vladimir Putin has found himself an ally in Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone. Putin's government, whose recently-introduced anti-gay legislation -- which prohibits spreading so-called ""gay"" propaganda to minors --  has been a focal point of critics. Opponents argue that the law enacted last year is in contravention to the spirit of the Olympic Games, with the Winter version being hosted this month by the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi. But in an exclusive interview with CNN, Ecclestone says he ""completely agrees"" with Putin's policy towards homosexuals. ""He hasn't said he doesn't agree (with homosexuality) just that he doesn't want these things publicized to an audience under the age of 18,"" said Ecclestone, arguing critics had misrepresented Putin. ""I completely agree with those sentiments and if you took a world census you'd find 90% of the world agree with it as well,"" added the 83-year-old, who oversees one of the world's most lucrative sports. The F1 ringmaster last met with Putin in February 2013, when he flew to Sochi to assess construction progress ahead of Russia's debut grand prix. The Black Sea resort town will stage round 16 of this year's world championship on a circuit that will run around the Olympic Park's facilities. Ecclestone believes Russia has done a ""first-class job"" in the new circuit's preparation and a ""super job"" hosting the Olympics and that more credit should be given to Putin. ""I've great admiration for him and his courage to say what he says,"" said the octogenarian. ""It may upset a few people but that's how the world is. It's how he sees (the world) and I think he's completely right,"" Ecclestone added. The controversial billionaire is due to face trial in Germany, which is scheduled to start in April, accused of making corrupt payments to a banker who worked on the sale of F1 in 2006. Ecclestone denies the charges, along with those brought against him in a civil case in London, where he was accused of undervaluing the sport of F1 in the same deal. Ecclestone was cleared in the latter case Thursday, despite being labeled as ""not reliable or truthful"" by the judge -- who ruled that German company Constantin Medien's claim for compensation was without merit. Justice Newey said Ecclestone had entered into a ""corrupt agreement"" with banker Gerhard Gribkowsky in 2005, but the magistrate said no loss to Constantin had been proved, the UK Press Association reported. Succession planning . With Ecclestone's legal problems casting doubt over his future in F1, the media has been speculating about his possible successors -- with Red Bull team principal Christian Horner and Justin King, chief executive of British supermarket Sainsbury's top of the list. Ecclestone said it was hard to assess whether they had the right skills needed for the job. ""I've no idea what attributes you'd need,"" he told CNN. ""It's like saying we'd need someone to replace Frank Sinatra, you know? You never know what they'd need to have until they start the role. ""For someone to hold a high position in China or Japan you have to be older than I am -- at least the good thing about that is you're not going to have them for that long!"" F1 revamp . This season F1 will see wide-scale changes. As well as Russia making its debut on the race calendar, the cars will be powered by smaller, V6 hybrid engines that promise greater fuel efficiency. However, the move away from the loud V8s is a development that concerns Ecclestone, who is worried the sport may lose some of its drama through the subsequent noise reduction. ""I'm not at all happy with the sound of the new engines, to be honest,"" he said. ""It doesn't sound like F1, but that's my opinion, let's wait and see what the public think."" The system for awarding points to drivers has also been revamped. The victor in the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix will now win 50 points compared to the 25 points on offer for each of the other 18 races, and Ecclestone is keen to extend that change to the last three events. ""The reason is simple -- with the calendar as it is the championship could be over by September and if there's another three races to go and a car that looks like it could win easy now -- (the rival cars) if they win two or three races at the end, could win the championship (instead),"" said Ecclestone. ""Why should it devalue six races before the end? People will be following like hell to see who's there at the end of the races. Win the last three and you can win the championship, it's a whole different scenario.""","Bernie Ecclestone backs Russian President Vladimir Putin on gay rights issue .

"Is this the end of ""Gangnam Style"" mania? Korean pop star PSY -- who rose to fame through his YouTube record-breaking video ""Gangnam Style"" -- apologized Friday for anti-American lyrics he rapped back in 2004. That performance resurfaced on CNN's iReport and then circulated widely online. It included lyrics calling for the death of American troops serving in Iraq, not long after news of the brutal slaying of a South Korean hostage by Iraqi insurgents -- an incident which sparked anti-American sentiment in South Korea. In his apology, PSY said his performance had been emotionally charged and was a response to events in the war in Iraq. ""I understand the sacrifices American servicemen and women have made to protect freedom and democracy in my country and around the world,"" he said in a statement. He said the song ""was part of a deeply emotional reaction to the war in Iraq and the killing of two Korean schoolgirls that was part of the overall anti-war sentiment shared by others around the world at that time."" The girls were struck and killed by a U.S. military vehicle. PSY continued: ""While I'm grateful for the freedom to express one's self, I've learned there are limits to what language is appropriate and I'm deeply sorry for how these lyrics could be interpreted. I will forever be sorry for any pain I have caused by those words. ""While it's important that we express our opinions, I deeply regret the inflammatory and inappropriate language I used to do so."" The lyrics of the song, titled ""Dear America,"" were written by the South Korean rock band N.E.X.T., and PSY was one of three performers rapping out the lyrics on stage. The lyrics were posted on a then-unvetted CNN iReport in October. The English translation of the Korean lyrics has picked up steam online since then, drawing thousands of views, and then exploding on blogs and social media this week. CNN reached out to the iReporter who brought attention to PSY's anti-American lyrics, but did not receive a response. CNN was able to translate the lyrics as saying,"" Kill those f--ing Yankees who have been torturing Iraqi captives and those who ordered them to torture,"" and going on to say, ""Kill them all slowly and painfully,"" as well as ""daughters, mothers, daughters-in-law and fathers."" PSY shook hands with President Barack Obama over the weekend at ""Christmas in Washington,"" a charity music concert where he performed alongside stars such as Diana Ross and Demi Lovato. Before PSY's D.C. performance, his controversial lyrics led to a petition on whitehouse.gov demanding that he be dropped from the concert. Even as conservative websites picked up the story, the petition was deleted later in the day. The White House website claimed that it violated terms of participation. Commenters on the original CNN iReport responded with varying viewpoints on the lyrics. Some expressed outrage over the Korean pop star's alleged call for the slaying American troops. Commenter shin000 said on October 31: ""Whatever the reason is, the fact that PSY insulted American Army and their family is changeless. He sang this song because of that accident and public opinion?"" Others praised PSY for speaking up and expressing his anti-war sentiments. Commenter SavvyMike said on October 30: ""As an American, this makes me like Psy even more. Glad to see he has the balls to call out America when we are doing evil."" Other commenters lashed out at the iReporter, saying that he misrepresented PSY in his iReport contribution. Commenter jsong9172 said on October 30, 2012: ""He is criticizing the US Army, not the country. Do a thorough background research before you scribble something otherwise you'd ruin one's life."" After the lyrics from the 2004 performance surfaced, there was an often vitriolic response on Twitter: . ""So Mr. 'Gangnam Style' @psy_oppa made a song before about America and how all U.S. soldiers should be killed....guy should flee the US now,"" said @TheOfficialTate. Fashion publicist/reality star Kelly Cutrone said his ""words against the women in my country"" were ""disgusting,"" and referred to him as a ""poseur faker freak."" @eclecticbrotha defended him saying, ""Oh look, we're supposed to hate Psy because he once joined protests against American imperialism."" As for PSY's handling of the criticism, Matt J. Duffy, a journalism teacher from Atlanta, tweeted, ""His statement is lesson in good crisis PR."" It's unclear what the fallout of the revelation of these anti-American lyrics will be. But it has us wondering -- what do you think the consequences should be? Should a rapper be held accountable for what he said in 2004? Let's talk about it in the comments on this story. You can be sure we'll continue this conversation on CNN for the next few days.","South Korean pop star PSY apologized for what he called ""inflammatory"" lyrics .

"The government mental hospital where John Hinckley Jr. has spent most of the last 30 years since he shot and tried to kill President Ronald Reagan is asking a federal court to allow Hinckley's eventual release to live with or near his aging mother in Williamsburg, Virginia. The prosecution, in its own filing with the court on Friday, described Hinckley as ""a man capable of great violence"" and said his mental condition has not improved to the point of eliminating concerns ""that this violence may be repeated."" U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman has scheduled up to a week of court hearings on the issue to start November 28, the Monday after Thanksgiving. Hinckley is now 56. He was committed to St. Elizabeths Hospital in 1982 after a jury found him innocent by reason of insanity in the shooting of President Reagan and three others, including the president's severely wounded press secretary, James Brady. The hospital's lawyers and doctors filed their motion under seal, withheld from the public, when they asked at the end of this past July that Hinckley eventually be placed on ""convalescent leave."" But government lawyers quoted the hospital's proposal, making it part of the court's public record, in their response Friday in opposing his release. The day that changed presidential security forever . According to the government, the hospital has asked first for a series of extended visits to Williamsburg and then, ""it be given the sole discretion to place Hinckley on convalescent leave in his mother's hometown."" His widowed mother, Jo Ann Hinckley, is now 85. She lives in a gated resort development not far from the James River in Williamsburg. Hinckley has been allowed several visits with her for up to a week and a half at a time over the last couple of years. But he has been required to carry a GPS tracking device when away from the house and the Secret Service has kept watch on his movements. That surveillance would be loosened under the hospital's proposal. Gallery: The attack on Ronald Reagan . Under the hospital's current proposal, Hinckley would be permitted eight longer visits to Williamsburg, the first two for 17 days each, the rest for 24 days each. After that, the prosecution filing said, the hospital wants to release Hinckley on leave ""without any further review"" by the court. Hinckley was a college dropout, drifting around the country, living off his family's money, when he waited for President Reagan to walk out of a Washington hotel where he had been speaking on March 30, 1981. Hinckley emptied his six-shot .22 revolver at the president. He wounded Brady, a policeman and a Secret Service agent before his last shot ricocheted off the president's armor-plated limousine and struck Reagan beneath his left armpit as he was being shoved into the car by other agents. The bullet penetrated within an inch of the president's heart. One lung flooded with blood. Reagan lost half his body's blood supply. Doctors said that had the Secret Service not rushed the president to a nearby hospital as quickly as they did, he might well have died. Brady suffered a serious brain injury and never was able to return to his White House duties. In his hotel room that day, Hinckley left behind a letter addressed to child actress Jodie Foster, with whom he was infatuated. It began: . ""There is a definite possibility that I may be killed in my attempt to get Reagan."" Hinckley wrote he was doing this to try to win her love. Foster would later say she didn't even know who Hinckley was. A federal judge committed Hinckley to St. Elizabeths Hospital after a jury found him not guilty by reason of insanity in the spring of 1982. Doctors have told the court in previous hearings that Hinckley's mental problems are in remission. Government lawyers disputed that in their latest filing, saying: . ""There is recent evidence of deception toward his treating physicians as well as narcissism, both of which are significant risk factors for future violence.""","Hospital requests longer visits to Virginia, then convalescent leave .

"Three years after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, workers have dug up a massive chunk of weathered crude from the shallows off a Louisiana beach. The tar mat, a slab of oil residue mixed with wet sand, was about 165 feet long by 65 feet wide, said Lt. Cmdr. Natalie Murphy, a Coast Guard spokeswoman. It weighed more than 40,000 pounds, but more than 85% of that weight was sand, shells and water, she said. The mat was found under the surf off Isle Grand Terre, Louisiana, about 90 miles south of New Orleans. Crews using an excavator dug the largely submerged tar mat out of the beach in chunks over the last few weeks, Murphy said. Empty nets in Louisiana three years after the spill . Louisiana is the last state where regular cleanup operations from the oil spill are still under way. The Coast Guard and BP, the owner of the ruptured well at the heart of the disaster, declared the cleanup over in Alabama, Florida and Mississippi earlier this month, but more than 80 miles of the Louisiana coast are still being patrolled. Coast Guard, BP end Gulf cleanup in 3 states . BP has recovered more than 2.7 million pounds of waste from Louisiana shores in 2013, with residual oil making up between 5 and 15% of that total weight, company spokesman Jason Ryan told CNN. The drill rig Deepwater Horizon exploded and sank in April 2010, killing 11 men aboard and unleashing an undersea gusher a mile beneath the surface of the Gulf of Mexico.

"The villagers had congregated at the tent, as they often did at the end of the workday, to sit and chat. Among them were men who sold vegetables or wood. Others mined or traded minerals used to make alloys like stainless steel. They were husbands and fathers, brothers and sons. But unlike villagers who might gather like this in many other parts of the world, these men had strange company at their customary get-together. They were living in North Waziristan, one of Pakistan's thinly governed tribal areas bordering Afghanistan and a hotbed of militancy. Hanging above them in the evening sky were four remotely piloted aircraft. Drones. Without warning, the aircraft unleashed a volley of missiles that struck the tent, killing eight people. A few minutes later, after other villagers had approached the wreckage to help the victims, the drones fired again, deepening the carnage. By the end, 18 people were dead, including at 14-year-old boy, and 22 others were wounded, including an 8-year-old girl. ""Body parts were scattered everywhere. Bodies without heads and bodies without hands or legs,"" said Ahsan, a miner and local resident who had been praying at the time of the first wave of missiles. Malala to Obamas: Drone strikes 'fueling terrorism' 'Will I Be Next?' Ahsan's account of the attack in the village of Zowi Sidgi in July 2012, along with those of other witnesses and victims' relatives, form part of a report released Tuesday by Amnesty International titled ""'Will I Be Next?' U.S. Drone Strikes in Pakistan."" The report provides detailed information on nine out of 45 drone strikes it says were carried out by the United States in North Waziristan between January 2012 and September 2013. In some of the attacks, it says, the victims weren't members of militant groups like al Qaeda or the Taliban, but just ordinary civilians, like the workers in Zowi Sidgi. It recounts another strike, in October 2012, in which a 68-year-old woman, Mamana Bibi, was blown apart by a drone as she picked vegetables in front of her grandchildren, several of whom were injured in the attack. ""Amnesty International is seriously concerned that these and other strikes have resulted in unlawful killings that may constitute extrajudicial executions or war crimes,"" the report said. Mustafa Qadri, Amnesty International's Pakistan researcher, said that while war crimes have possibly been committed, that cannot be confirmed without more information from the U.S. government. Leaders due to meet . Made public the day before Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is due to meet U.S. President Barack Obama in Washington, the report calls for a series of measures to bring the drone program in line with international law. Those include conducting impartial investigations into the cases documented, bringing those responsible for human rights violations to justice and offering compensation to civilian victims' families. On Tuesday, Sharif was at the United States Institute of Peace in Washington. ""Recently our political parties in a national conference declared the use of drones is not only a continued violation of our territorial integrity but also detrimental to our resolve at efforts in eliminating terrorism from our country,"" Sharif said. ""This issue has become a major irritant in our bilateral relationship as well. I therefore would stress the need for an end to the drone attacks."" Sharif has previously called for an end to the U.S. drone program in Pakistan, where it has stirred deep anger, and will raise the issue with Obama on Wednesday, said Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry, a spokesman for the Pakistani Foreign Ministry. ""The government of Pakistan believes drone strikes are against international law and the sovereignty of Pakistan,"" Chaudhry told CNN. ""Drone strikes are counterproductive to fighting terrorism."" Pakistan wants to persuade the United States to stop using drones, he said. ""International opinion is against drone strikes, not just here in Pakistan, but in the world,"" Chaudhry said. ""This opinion is strengthening."" Adding to the pressure, Human Rights Watch also released a report on U.S. drone attacks Tuesday -- this one focusing on Yemen. Letta Taylor, a senior counterterrorism researcher for Human Rights Watch, said the group found at least two clear cases of violations of international laws of war, but those did not reach war crimes status. The group said four of the six attacks it had investigated ""may have violated the laws of war."" Sources: Drone strikes in Yemen kill 6, including senior AQAP leaders . Lack of U.S. disclosure . Based on extensive field research, the reports underlined the difficulties of gathering information on attacks in dangerous areas of Pakistan and Yemen. ""We found that despite assurances from President Obama that (the U.S. government is) doing its utmost to protect civilians from harm, that in fact in many cases it is killing innocent civilians, even dozens of them, if not more,"" Taylor said. And both reports noted the U.S. government's unwillingness to talk about the cases. The lack of information from U.S. authorities, Amnesty said, makes it impossible ""to reach firm conclusions about the context in which the U.S. drone attacks on Mamana Bibi and on the 18 laborers took place, and therefore their status under international law."" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney rejected the idea that the United States has violated any laws. ""To the extent these reports claim that the U.S. has acted contrary to international law we would strongly disagree,"" he said at a press briefing Tuesday. ""The administration has repeatedly emphasized the extraordinary care that we take to make sure that counterterrorism actions are in accordance with all applicable law."" The U.S. government has said strikes by the unmanned aircraft are a necessary part of the fight against militant groups. In May, Obama defended the drone program and disclosed the guidelines determining its use. He said drones would be deployed only when there is an imminent threat, no hope of capturing the targeted terrorist, ""near certainty"" that civilians wouldn't be harmed and ""no other governments capable of effectively addressing the threat."" Civilian victims in Yemen . But Human Rights Watch said the evidence it had gathered ""strongly suggests"" that the strikes in Yemen it documented ""did not adhere"" to the policies set out by Obama. The group said the attacks its report covers took place between 2009 and 2013, killing 82 people, at least 57 of them civilians. The strikes ostensibly targeted suspected members of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), but victims included women, children, truck drivers and other civilians, the report said. ""At least four of the strikes were carried out by drones, a fifth strike by either drones or warplanes, and a sixth one by cruise missiles releasing cluster munitions, indiscriminate weapons that pose unacceptable dangers to civilians,"" it said. The report also questioned the military validity of several of the suspected al Qaeda operatives targeted. Fear and polarization . Both reports describe the climate of fear created by the drones in Pakistan and Yemen, and the polarizing effect the attacks are having on local populations. ""The ultimate tragedy is that the drone aircraft the USA deploys over Pakistan now instill the same kind of fear in the people of the Tribal Areas that was once associated only with al Qaeda and the Taliban,"" said the Amnesty report. ""Like other forces operating in the Tribal Areas, the USA appears to be exploiting the lawless and remote nature of the region to evade accountability for its violations,"" it said. Human Rights Watch described a similar situation in Yemen. ""We Yemenis are the ones who pay the price of the 'war on terror,'"" Faisal bin Ali Jaber, a relative of a cleric and a police officer who were both killed in a drone attack in August 2012, was quoted as saying in the report. ""We are caught between a drone on one side and al Qaeda on the other."" The report warned that ""should the United States continue targeted killings in Yemen without addressing the consequences of killing civilians and taking responsibility for unlawful deaths, it risks further angering many Yemenis and handing another recruiting card to AQAP."" 'A dangerous precedent' The reports set out a list of recommendations, primarily for the U.S. government, but also for authorities in Pakistan and Yemen. More broadly, Amnesty warned that the American government may be setting a troubling standard in its use of drones that other countries could follow. ""U.S. policy and practice on targeted killings and drones are not only of concern in their own right: they also set a dangerous precedent that other states may seek to exploit to avoid responsibility for their own unlawful killings,"" the report said. In Yemen, images of the charred, shattered remains of the cleric and policemen killed in August 2012 have circulated in the village where the attack took place, the Human Rights Watch report says. ""Now when villagers see these images,"" Jaber, the relative, was quoted as saying, ""they think of America.""","White House denies any laws were violated .

"Two Brooklyn men who have spent the last 21 years in prison for three murders that DNA evidence suggests they did not commit were released Thursday on consent of the Brooklyn district attorney. Anthony Yarbough, 39, and Sharrif Wilson, 37, were arrested in June 1992 in the slaying Yarbough's 40-year-old mother, his 12-year-old sister and another 12-year-old girl in a Coney Island housing project. ""In this case, my office examined newly discovered scientific evidence that was not available at the time of the trial,"" Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth P. Thompson said in statement to CNN. ""My obligation under the law is to determine whether this new information, had it been known and presented at trial, would have been more likely than not to cause the trial jury to return a different verdict."" In 2013, new DNA evidence from under Yarbough's mother's fingernails matched sperm from the 1999 unsolved rape and murder of Migdalia Ruiz of Brooklyn, according to an investigation by the Medical Examiner's office. Yarbough and Wilson were already incarcerated when the 1999 rape and murder occurred, according to Adam Perlmutter, Wilson's attorney. ""Based on this new evidence, I believe a jury would have been more likely to return a different verdict,"" Thompson said. Zachary Margulis-Ohuma, Yarbough's attorney, is glad justice has finally been served. ""Anybody looking at this evidence with an open mind would see that there is no chance in the world that Tony murdered his mother and these two little girls,"" Margulis-Ohuma said. According to Margulis-Ohuma, this case was ""easy"" with such ""obvious evidence of innocence."" Margulis-Ohuma hopes Thompson will devote the resources in the future to investigate the ""harder"" cases. Yarbough was just 18, and Wilson only 15, when they were accused of murder. Yarbough came home after a night out and discovered the victims choked to death with electrical cords and stabbed multiple times. The two young girls had been partially undressed, according to Perlmutter. Yarbough's mother, Annie, his sister Chavonn Barnes, and Chavonn's  friend Latsaha Knox were killed. Brooklyn detectives placed Yarbough and Wilson into separate interview rooms and coerced false confessions from the two teens, who were later convicted in separate trials. Yarbough was sentenced to 75 years to life in prison. Wilson was offered a deal by the district attorney's office for a nine-years-to-life sentence, but his case was disputed after he wrote Yarbough's family in 2005 saying that he had lied at the trial. Yarbough's attorney and the district attorney's office began revisiting the case in 2010. Thompson came into office in January with promises to restore justice to the wrongfully convicted. This case is part of a review of  Brooklyn killings from the 1980s and early 1990s. ""I'm feeling really blessed right,"" Yarbough said. ""I was extremely anxious and nervous. I didn't know what was going to happen. There were so many setbacks."" When asked about his relationship with Wilson, Yarbough said he has no animosity. ""I'm happy that he's out. I wish him and his family nothing but the best,"" Yarbough said. Yarbough says he does not know what his next step will be. At this time, after years behind bars, Yarbough is happy to move on. ""It was hard to keep my hopes up, but God is good now, I'm out now, I'm free, thank God,"" Yarbough said.","Anthony Yarbough and Sharrif Wilson were convicted in a 1992 triple murder .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Iraqi Christians under siege by Islamic militants are welcome in the country's north, a Kurdish leader said Thursday, after a string of attacks that have killed dozens of the faith. ""I want to let them know that the Kurdistan Region is open to them. If they want to come, we will protect them and provide them with all services,"" said Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan regional government. ""We are extremely sorry for the crimes they have been subjected to and we condemn these criminal acts, they are innocent people and a precious part of this nation."" In the past, the regional government has opened its doors to other persecuted minorities. Many Christian families that CNN spoke to Wednesday said they feared for their own safety and wanted to leave Iraq, but didn't have the means to do so. Some Iraqi church leaders and politicians such as Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki have been discouraging Iraqi Christians, one of the oldest Christian civilizations in the world, from leaving. CNN reporters in Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdish north have noticed an influx of Christians in the country's north in recent days, but there has been a general migration since 2003. Barzani's comments came after the United States, the U.N. Security Council and an American Catholic archbishop expressed concerns Wednesday about the continuing attacks on Christian and other religious groups in Iraq. At least three people were killed and 25 wounded Wednesday morning, an Iraqi interior ministry official said. On Tuesday evening, three people were wounded in western Baghdad when bombs exploded outside Christian homes there, the ministry said. ""The United States strongly condemns the recent terrorist attacks in Iraq, which were perpetrated by al Qaeda in Iraq against Christians in Baghdad in their homes and in their churches,"" said Mike Hammer, spokesman for the White House's National Security Council. ""We also strongly condemn additional attacks against innocent civilians throughout Iraq, to include pilgrims in the holy cities of Najaf and Karbala."" The U.N. Security Council also decried attacks on places of worship in Iraq. The archbishop of Chicago, Illinois, urged U.S. President Barack Obama to take steps to protect Christians in Iraq. ""Having invaded Iraq, our nation has a moral obligation not to abandon those Iraqis who cannot defend themselves,"" wrote Cardinal Francis George of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. A group called the Islamic State of Iraq claimed responsibility for the gruesome October 31 siege of the Sayidat al-Nejat cathedral that left 70 people dead and 75 wounded. The umbrella group includes a number of Sunni extremist organizations and has ties to al Qaeda in Iraq. Thirty-five Christian survivors of the attack arrived in France this week, where they will be able to seek asylum. The gunmen who led the attack demanded that the Iraqi government release a number of detainees and prisoners in Iraqi prisons, saying the Christian hostages would be freed in return, according to the police officials. Iraq's defense minister later said on state television that the kidnappers had demanded the release of a number of prisoners in both Iraq and Egypt.","Kurdish leader condemns attacks against Christians .

"With two days to go before the Winter Olympics open in the Russian city of Sochi, more than half of Americans think a terrorist attack on the Games is likely, a poll shows. The results of the CNN/ORC poll come a day after U.S. officials said they had specific reasons to worry about security in Russia. Meanwhile, Russian state media reported Wednesday that the suspected mastermind of twin bomb attacks in the city of Volgograd was killed in a police operation in the restive North Caucasus republic of Dagestan. The man died in a shootout at a house in the town of Izberbash, the official Itar-Tass news agency said. The attacks on Volgograd's public transit system in late December left 34 people dead and about 100 injured -- and sparked wide concern about security in Russia. Of those surveyed for the CNN/ORC poll, 57% said a terrorist attack on the Sochi Games was likely. That compares with the 51% who believed before the 1996 Summer Games started in Atlanta that a terrorist act would occur. Sadly, the latter prediction proved true. The survey of more than 1,000 Americans, carried out on Friday and Sunday, also revealed some wider negative views about Russia and its leader, President Vladimir Putin. It found that 54% have an unfavorable view of Putin, making him one of the least popular foreign leaders among Americans. Currently, 55% of those polled also have an unfavorable view of Russia -- representing a downward turn from 2011, when more than half those surveyed viewed the country favorably. A controversial ""anti-gay propaganda"" law passed by Russian lawmakers last summer may be a factor in that shift. Only 13% of Americans think the United States should have a law similar to the one in Russia -- which makes it illegal to make positive comments about gays and lesbians within children's earshot -- with 86% opposed, the survey indicated. Supporters of gay rights group All Out are staging events Wednesday in 20 cities across 14 countries to call on Olympic sponsors to denounce Russia's anti-gay laws. New York, London and St. Petersburg, Russia, are among the cities where demonstrators will gather. By contrast, a survey by Russia's independent Levada Center found that 53% of Russians think their country did ""the right thing"" by bidding to hold the Sochi Olympics, the state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported. But only about a third said Russia should seek to hold the Summer Games as well, compared with 43% who disliked the idea, the survey indicated. Respondents highlighted concerns about opportunities for graft and corruption. Olympic torch reaches Sochi . Concerns about security, human rights issues and the readiness of Sochi accommodations have dogged media coverage leading up to the Games. But for many Russians, the chance to hold the Olympics for only the second time on Russian soil is a source of great pride. The Olympic torch arrived in Sochi on Wednesday, the culmination of a 123-day relay that has seen it cover nearly 35,000 miles (56,000 kilometers), held aloft by some 14,000 people. Along the way, it has been carried to the top of Europe's tallest mountain, Mount Elbrus, and to the bottom of the world's biggest freshwater lake, Lake Baikal in Siberia. Back in November, the torch was also taken on its first spacewalk, after blasting off for the International Space Station from Russia's Baikonur cosmodrome. Two cosmonauts carried the torch -- unlit for safety reasons -- through the space station and outside in space. Having reached Sochi, it will be used to light the cauldron in the opening ceremony Friday evening. Then, Russian authorities hope, the focus should shift to the feats of sporting excellence performed by athletes from around the world. One U.S. medal hopeful, two-time Olympic gold medalist Shaun White, has announced he is withdrawing from the slopestyle competition, according to the official Sochi 2014 website. The champion snowboarder said he wants to focus on winning a gold medal in the halfpipe competition. Just over half of Americans say it is important to them that the United States wins more medals than any other country, according to the CNN/ORC poll. The Levada Center poll of Russians found that 57% expect the host country to rank in the top three in the overall medal count, RIA Novosti said. Specific threats . Russia has worked hard to reassure the athletes, officials and spectators converging on Sochi that they will be kept safe. A ""ring of steel"" has been in place around the Black Sea resort city for almost a month. Russian security forces have also cracked down on suspected militants in Dagestan and elsewhere in recent weeks, after the December bombings in Volgograd. But not everyone is convinced. Speaking at a House Intelligence Committee hearing Tuesday, Matthew Olsen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center, highlighted concern about the Games and whether Muslim fundamentalists in disputed regions of Russia -- or other groups -- could launch deadly attacks on selected targets. ""There are a number of specific threats of varying degrees of credibility that we're tracking,"" he said. ""And we're working very closely with the Russians and with other partners to monitor any threats we see and to disrupt those."" Officials in Austria said Tuesday that two female members of its Winter Olympics team had received a threat. Greater danger outside Sochi? Olsen said the primary threat came from the Caucasus Emirate, or Imarat Kavkaz, which he described as probably the most prominent terror group in Russia. ""It's made its intent clear to seek to carry out attacks in the runup to the Games,"" he said. ""We think the greater danger from a terrorist perspective is in potential for attacks to occur outside of the actual venues for the Games themselves, in the area surrounding Sochi or outside of Sochi in the region."" U.S. President Barack Obama was briefed Tuesday on U.S. efforts to support security in Sochi. ""He was assured by his team that they are taking all appropriate steps regarding the safety of Americans. He directed them to continue to work closely with the Russian government and other partners toward a secure and successful Sochi Games, and to review carefully and act on any new information that might affect the security of the Games,"" a White House statement said.","The Olympic torch arrives in Sochi after a nearly 35,000-mile journey .

"In a bold political and legal move, the Obama administration formally expressed its support for same-sex marriage in California, setting up a high stakes political and constitutional showdown at the U.S. Supreme Court over a fast-evolving and contentious issue. In a broadly worded legal brief on Thursday that senior government sources said had President Barack Obama's personal input and blessing, the Justice Department asserted gay and lesbian couples in the nation's most populous state have the same ""equal protection"" right to wed and that voters there were not empowered to ban it. ""Use of a voter initiative to promote democratic self-governance cannot save a law like Proposition 8 that would otherwise violate equal protection,"" said the brief. ""Prejudice may not however be the basis for differential treatment under the law."" California's 2008 Proposition 8 referendum revoked the right of same-sex couples to wed after lawmakers and the state courts previously allowed it. While the administration weighed in on the situation in California, it specifically refused to argue the constitutional right for same-sex couples to wed there should be extended to the 41 states that currently define marriage as between one man and one woman. The justices will hear the case in March. ""The government seeks to vindicate the defining constitutional ideal of equal treatment under the law,"" said Attorney General Eric Holder. ""Throughout history, we have seen the unjust consequences of decisions and policies rooted in discrimination."" ""The issues before the Supreme Court in this case and the Defense of Marriage Act case are not just important to the tens of thousands Americans who are being denied equal benefits and rights under our laws, but to our nation as a whole,"" Holder added. The White House was not expected to issue a separate statement. The California matter and another appeal over the federal Defense of Marriage Act will produce blockbuster rulings from the justices in coming months. Same-sex marriage could be a defining moment in Obama's presidency, similar to the political impact last year when the Supreme Court upheld the health care reform law he spearheaded. He must decide how much political capital to expend in coming months when expressing his views and those of the executive branch. Gay rights groups had privately urged Obama and his top aides to go beyond his previous personal rhetoric in support of the right to marry and come down ""on the side of history."" Opinion: 2013 -- A year for big issues in the courts . Obama has already faced strong opposition on the issue from many Republican state and congressional lawmakers, as well as social conservatives. The justices will hear oral arguments in the Proposition 8 case March 26, with a ruling due by the last week of June. The separate case over the Defense of Marriage Act involves a 1996 law that says for federal purposes, marriage is defined as only between one man and one woman. That means federal tax, Social Security, pension, and bankruptcy benefits, and family medical leave protections do not apply to gay and lesbian couples. That case will be argued March 27. But it is the California case where the high court is being asked to establish the constitutional ""equal protection"" right. The administration is not a party in the appeal and was not required to weigh in, but it decided to file an amicus or ""friend of the court"" brief. It is rare for a president to be personally involved in the legal and political considerations in a high court appeal, and sources say he spent a good deal of time reading up on the issue and articulating his views privately. Much of the legal reasoning in any government brief would reflect in large part his personal thinking, gained from his years as a former constitutional law professor. Obama administration weighs in on defense of marriage law . There are about approximately 120,000 legally married same-sex couples in the United States. The administration, in its brief, also hinted that so-called ""civil union"" laws in California and seven other states may be unconstitutional. In what some have labeled the ""eight-state strategy,"" the Justice Department argues civil union and domestic partnership laws in California, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, and Rhode Island may be unconstitutional and that they should go all the way and grant them full marriage rights. ""The object of California's establishment of the legal relationship of domestic partnership is to grant committed same-sex couples rights equivalent to those accorded a married couple. but Proposition 8, by depriving same-sex couples of the right to marry, denies them the dignity, respect, and stature accorded similarly situated opposite-sex couples under state law,"" the court brief said. Such civil union laws in most cases provide the same rights of marriage under state law, without actually calling it that. Dozens of advocacy groups on both sides of the issue have bombarded the high court with briefs, including a coalition of national Republicans, business, faith, and military leaders supporting same-sex marriage. Among the prominent conservative names lending their view: former Utah governor and presidential candidate Jon Huntsman, Hewlitt-Packard chief executive and former California gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman, U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Florida), and actor Clint Eastwood. ""As a Republican, I believe in protecting individual freedoms and that everyone, including gay and lesbian Americans, has a constitutional right to be treated equally under the law,"" said former Rep. Jim Kolbe. California state officials, including Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, also weighed in to oppose Proposition 8. ""California's interests in protecting all of its children are best served by allowing these same-sex couples to enjoy the same benefits of marriage as opposite-sex couples,"" state Attorney General Kamala Harris said of the estimated 50,000 youngsters being raised by gay and lesbian couples in the state. Obama has had an evolving position on gay rights, once supporting only civil unions. But in his inaugural address last month, he raised expectations, and perhaps signaled his impending legal views, when offering sweeping rhetoric. ""Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law-- for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well."" Opinion: Gay Americans pay more taxes for fewer rights . In February, a federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled the California measure unconstitutional. In its split decision, the panel found that Proposition 8 ""works a meaningful harm to gays and lesbians"" by denying their right to civil marriage. The Supreme Court has discretion to rule narrowly or broadly on the aspects of the legal and procedural questions raised.

"West Virginia's water crisis won't end any time soon, officials said Saturday. Testing must be completed to determine whether chemicals from a leak are still contaminating the water system in nine counties in the southwest section of the state, West Virginia American Water President Jeff McIntyre told reporters Saturday. That means the do-not-use order issued Thursday won't be lifted for days, he said. Some 300,000 West Virginia residents, in the meantime, still won't be able to use tap water to wash hands, brush teeth or take showers. They're being urged to watch for symptoms of exposure to the chemical, such as skin irritation, nausea, vomiting and wheezing. Homeland Security is trucking in 16 tractor-trailer loads of bottled water to help. The water restrictions were imposed Thursday when it was discovered about 7,500 gallons of a chemical used to clean coal --  4-methylcyclohexane methanol -- had leaked out of a storage tank located a mile upriver from the water plant. The medical impact was hard to assess. ""We've had a lot of worried-well calls,"" said Dr. Rahul Gupta, of the Kanawha-Charleston Health Department. He cited complaints of irritation of the skin, throat, chest and stomach that some residents have linked to possible exposure to the chemical. The unknowns make residents anxious. ""They don't even know what the health risks are,"" Stacy Kirk of Culloden told CNN affiliate WSAZ. ""We had bathed, cooked and everything right before the news came on yesterday."" ""I don't know anything about the chemical to say too much good or bad about it, so we're all up in the air,"" said Arthur Taylor. ""We're common folks -- we're not chemists."" Anxiety about effects of chemical . Water company spokeswoman Laura Jordan urged people to get medical attention ""if they are feeling something ... isn't right."" Many -- perhaps too many -- did just that. ""Our emergency rooms have been very busy with individuals unnecessarily concerned and presenting no symptoms,"" said the Charleston Area Medical Center. Karen Bowling, secretary of the state's Department of Health & Human Resources, said 73 people had reported to emergency departments, but that only two had been admitted to hospitals. ""That's really a very small number of patients that have been impacted by this,"" she said. Dr. Robert Maha, chief medical officer for MedExpress, a group of seven medical clinics in the area, said a large number of patients are seeking treatment for symptoms they worry are tied to the chemical exposure. He said the water crisis may contribute to the spread of flu, since people are having a difficult time finding clean water to wash their hands. ""That's one of our biggest concerns for the community,"" Maha said. Officials will know that the water is safe for more than firefighting and toilet flushing -- its only sanctioned uses now -- when tests find less than 1 ppm of 4-methylcyclohexane methanol in treated water, McIntyre said. Four laboratories have been set up to measure the levels in a uniform manner. ""The treatment plant must consistently produce samples at or below this level before the current do-not-use order is lifted,"" McIntyre said. He said there was an inadequate number of sampling results to report current levels. Authorities planned to take 100 water samples on Saturday night and have them processed on Sunday, Maj. Gen. James Hoyer of the West Virginia National Guard said at a Saturday night press conference. Though the water woes since Thursday have led scores of businesses to close, Gupta said that some restaurants were reopening after devising alternative plans. The problem affected people of all ages. ""I'm here to get some water for the baby because she has to make formula,"" Deborah Williams, who was caring for a granddaughter in Culloden, told WSAZ. ""Right now, we're in desperate need of washing baby bottles and filling them up."" 7,500 gallons leaked . Mike Dorsey, chief of the Department of Environmental Protection's homeland security and emergency response division, said officials estimate that 7,500 gallons -- the equivalent of about 10 hot tubs that can accommodate eight people each -- leaked through a one-inch hole in the tank's stainless steel wall. ""It's an old system,"" he said about the physical plant, adding that the company had planned to upgrade it. Dorsey expressed confidence that the chemical, which smells of licorice, did not start leaking long before Thursday morning, when it was reported. ""We would have gotten odor complaints earlier than that if it had been going on longer,"" he said. The chemical overflowed a containment area around the tank run by Freedom Industries, then migrated over land and through the soil into the river. The leak happened about a mile upriver from the West Virginia American Water Co. plant. After concluding late Thursday afternoon that the tap water was contaminated, a stop-use warning went out to customers in Boone, Cabell, Clay, Jackson, Kanawha, Lincoln, Logan, Putnam and Roane counties. Since then, the offending material has been hauled from the site, officials said. Some residents have directed their anger at the coal industry company from whose storage tank the chemical leaked. ""It's caused us more problems than you could ever imagine,"" said Danny Jones, the mayor of Charleston, the state's capital and most populated city. ""It's a prison from which we would like to be released."" Kanawha County Commission President Kent Carper told CNN on Saturday that more than 100,000 customers were affected, bringing the number of people affected to about 300,000. On Friday, residents were urged to donate items and drop them off at the state capitol complex. That happened, but hundreds of people showed up expecting to pick up water, reported WSAZ. Officials called in some National Guard trucks to bring water. ""It was scary because I went to brush my teeth this morning, and I went to turn the water on, and it was like, you can't turn your water on yet,"" Evelyn Smith of Rand said. ""You have to change your mindset of how you do things right now."" An investigative team from the U.S. Chemical Safety Board on Saturday deployed to the scene of the spill. The CSB is an independent federal agency charged with investigating industrial chemical accidents. Freedom Industries President Gary Southern said two Freedom employees noticed material leaking from a storage tank into a dike around 10:30 a.m. Thursday. They contacted authorities and began the cleanup process -- including hauling away the chemical still in the tank and vacuuming up some from the nearby ground, he said. ""We have mitigated the risk, we believe, in terms of further material leaving this facility,""  said the head of Freedom, which supplies products for the coal-mining industry.

"Canadian authorities have arrested two men accused of planning to carry out an al Qaeda-supported attack against a passenger train traveling between Canada and the United States, a U.S. congressman told CNN on Monday. ""As I understand it, it was a train going from Canada to the U.S.,"" Rep. Peter King, R-New York, chairman of the counterterrorism and intelligence subcommittee, said. The news follows an announcement earlier in the day by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police that they had arrested Chiheb Esseghaier, 30, and Raed Jaser, 35. The two men are charged with ""receiving support from al Qaeda elements in Iran"" to carry out an attack and conspiring to murder people on a VIA railway train in the greater Toronto area, Assistant Police Commissioner James Malizia said. ""When I speak about supported, I mean direction and guidance,"" he said. Despite the allegation of links to al Qaeda in Iran, there was no evidence to suggest the planned attacks were state-sponsored, Malizia said. Iran vehemently denied the allegations that al Qaeda was operating inside its borders. ""Iran's position against this group is very clear and well known,"" according to a statement released by Iran's mission to the United Nations. ""Al Qaeda has no possibility to do any activity inside Iran or conduct any operation abroad from Iran's territory, and we reject strongly and categorically any connection to this story."" Neither the Canadian authorities nor King identified the exact route of the targeted train. Essenghaier, of Montreal, and Jaser, of Toronto, will make their first court appearance on Tuesday, police said. Authorities said the suspects were not Canadian citizens, but declined to identify their nationality or how long they had been in Canada. Essenghaier has been a doctoral student at the National Institute of Scientific Research at the University of Quebec since 2010, Julie Martineau, the university spokeswoman, said. He was conducting research on nanosensors, which are primarily used for medical treatments or to build other nanoproducts, such as computer chips, she said. ""I cannot comment on any behavior issues. He seemed like a normal student,"" Martineau said. There was no link between the Canadian investigation and the Boston Marathon bomb attack, an official with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police told CNN on condition of anonymity. Canadian authorities were tight-lipped about the planned time frame of the alleged attack except to say it was in the planning stage and not imminent. ""We are alleging these two individuals took steps and conducted activities to conduct a terrorist attack,"" Jennifer Strachan of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police told reporters. ""They watched trains and railways in the greater Toronto area."" The alleged attack included a plan to derail a passenger train, she said. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation quoted ""highly placed sources"" as saying the suspects were under surveillance for more than a year. The CBC reported that the investigation was ""part of a cross-border operation involving Canadian law enforcement agencies, the FBI and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security."" Al Qaeda has long studied the possibility of attacks on railroad systems -- seeing them as cheap, relatively easy to carry out and with potentially devastating results. The organization and its sympathizers have plotted attacks on railway systems in Spain and Germany. More than 200 people were killed and 1,700 injured in an attack that targeted several commuter trains in Madrid in March 2004. In a document seized during the raid in Pakistan that left Osama bin Laden dead was evidence of an al Qaeda discussion to target rail lines in the United States, a law enforcement official told CNN in late 2011. According to the document, al Qaeda members discussed as early as 2010 a plan to derail trains in the United States by placing obstructions on tracks over bridges and in valleys. The plan, according to the document, was to be executed to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks, though no specific rail system was identified, the official said. News of the arrests Monday came the same day Canada's parliament debated an anti-terrorism bill. Traditionally, al Qaeda's membership is seen as Sunni-dominated and not Shiite. As a result, al Qaeda and Iran have not been viewed as allies. ""We have very little intelligence on al Qaeda in Iran,"" King said. What is known is that bin Laden's son-in-law, Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, fled Afghanistan for Iran after the fall of the Taliban in 2001. According to U.S. documents and officials, in addition to Abu Ghaith, other members of bin Laden's inner circle ended up in Iran, including  the formidable military commander of al Qaeda, Saif al-Adel, and Saad bin Laden, one of the al Qaeda leader's older sons who has played some kind of leadership role in the group. Saad bin Laden also helped one of his father's wives and several of his father's children to move from Pakistan to Iran, officials said.","One of the suspects was a doctoral student at the University of Quebec .

"A suspect arrested in last week's deadly shooting at a Catholic church admitted ""involvement in the crime"" while in custody, Phoenix Police Chief Daniel V. Garcia said Monday. One priest died in the shooting and another was seriously wounded. The suspect, Gary Michael Moran, was identified through DNA evidence recovered both at the crime scene and from a car stolen from the church, Garcia said at a news conference. Witnesses also came forth with information, he added. Moran, 54, was arrested late Sunday at a halfway house, Garcia said. He described the suspect as a former felon with a history of violent offenses -- including aggravated assault and burglary -- who was released from prison on April 24. Since then, Moran had been ""living primarily in the streets and homeless shelters,"" Garcia said. In announcing the arrest, the police chief said once the suspect was in custody, Moran ""made admissions to his involvement in the crime"" before invoking his rights. In the shooting late Wednesday at Mater Misericordiae (Mother of Mercy) Mission Catholic Church, the Rev. Kenneth Walker was fatally shot and the Rev. Joseph Terra was wounded. Garcia called the attack on the two men a ""senseless act of violence"" and a ""vicious, tragic, horrifying"" offense. ""The city of Phoenix -- waking up to this horrific crime -- felt an urgency to bring this violent, felony offender to justice. It was something we felt committed to."" said Garcia. Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton echoed this sentiment calling the crime, ""as senseless as it is tragic."" Police said they believed it was a crime of opportunity -- a burglary that went bad. At around 9 p.m. Wednesday, Terra made a 911 call reporting a burglary at the church. According to Garcia, an intruder was discovered first by the 56-year-old Terra and the intruder allegedly attacked him with a metal rod. The suspect also reportedly managed to get a gun that belonged to the priest away from him and use it against him. When Walker, 29, emerged from his room -- after hearing noises -- the suspect also allegedly shot him with the gun, Garcia said. When officers arrived, they found both priests badly wounded. Terra was able to speak briefly with the officers before being taken for treatment. Walker died on his way to the hospital, according to police. A funeral Mass was held Monday for Walker. The service was attended by the police chief, the mayor and a local city councilman, Michael Nowakowski, as well as Walker's parishioners and members of the community. At the news conference, the mayor noted that although Walker had not been in Phoenix ""for a long period time, he had already made a lasting impact. His devotion to his church and those in his congregation meant a great deal to many of all faiths across this city."" Nowakowski spoke, saying he believed the priest would want his community to reach out and find ways to help those newly out of prison -- like Moran. ""If Father Walker were here today, he would probably say, ""We need to help and pray for those individuals who are released from jail...we need to help those individuals change their heart and rehabilitate them. We as a society need to figure out a way  to help those men and women who are released from jail go into a transition of hope -- not hopelessness -- and change their ways, somehow, someway.'"" Terra was moved out of intensive care over the weekend and is expected to make a full recovery, according to CNN affiliate KPHO.","Suspect is former felon, recent parolee, says police chief .

"Good afternoon, everybody. Ten days ago, the world watched in horror as men, women and children were massacred in Syria in the worst chemical weapons attack of the 21st century.  Yesterday the United States presented a powerful case that the Syrian government was responsible for this attack on its own people. Our intelligence shows the Assad regime and its forces preparing to use chemical weapons, launching rockets in the highly populated suburbs of Damascus, and acknowledging that a chemical weapons attack took place.  And all of this corroborates what the world can plainly see -- hospitals overflowing with victims; terrible images of the dead.  All told, well over 1,000 people were murdered.  Several hundred of them were children -- young girls and boys gassed to death by their own government. This attack is an assault on human dignity.  It also presents a serious danger to our national security.  It risks making a mockery of the global prohibition on the use of chemical weapons.  It endangers our friends and our partners along Syria's borders, including Israel, Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon and Iraq.  It could lead to escalating use of chemical weapons, or their proliferation to terrorist groups who would do our people harm. In a world with many dangers, this menace must be confronted. Now, after careful deliberation, I have decided that the United States should take military action against Syrian regime targets.  This would not be an open-ended intervention.  We would not put boots on the ground.  Instead, our action would be designed to be limited in duration and scope.  But I'm confident we can hold the Assad regime accountable for their use of chemical weapons, deter this kind of behavior, and degrade their capacity to carry it out. Our military has positioned assets in the region.  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs has informed me that we are prepared to strike whenever we choose.  Moreover, the Chairman has indicated to me that our capacity to execute this mission is not time-sensitive; it will be effective tomorrow, or next week, or one month from now.  And I'm prepared to give that order. But having made my decision as Commander-in-Chief based on what I am convinced is our national security interests, I'm also mindful that I'm the President of the world's oldest constitutional democracy.  I've long believed that our power is rooted not just in our military might, but in our example as a government of the people, by the people, and for the people.  And that's why I've made a second decision:  I will seek authorization for the use of force from the American people's representatives in Congress. Over the last several days, we've heard from members of Congress who want their voices to be heard.  I absolutely agree. So this morning, I spoke with all four congressional leaders, and they've agreed to schedule a debate and then a vote as soon as Congress comes back into session. In the coming days, my administration stands ready to provide every member with the information they need to understand what happened in Syria and why it has such profound implications for America's national security.  And all of us should be accountable as we move forward, and that can only be accomplished with a vote. I'm confident in the case our government has made without waiting for U.N. inspectors.  I'm comfortable going forward without the approval of a United Nations Security Council that, so far, has been completely paralyzed and unwilling to hold Assad accountable.  As a consequence, many people have advised against taking this decision to Congress, and undoubtedly, they were impacted by what we saw happen in the United Kingdom this week when the Parliament of our closest ally failed to pass a resolution with a similar goal, even as the Prime Minister supported taking action. Yet, while I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization, I know that the country will be stronger if we take this course, and our actions will be even more effective.  We should have this debate, because the issues are too big for business as usual.  And this morning, John Boehner, Harry Reid, Nancy Pelosi and Mitch McConnell agreed that this is the right thing to do for our democracy. A country faces few decisions as grave as using military force, even when that force is limited.  I respect the views of those who call for caution, particularly as our country emerges from a time of war that I was elected in part to end.  But if we really do want to turn away from taking appropriate action in the face of such an unspeakable outrage, then we just acknowledge the costs of doing nothing. Here's my question for every member of Congress and every member of the global community:  What message will we send if a dictator can gas hundreds of children to death in plain sight and pay no price?  What's the purpose of the international system that we've built if a prohibition on the use of chemical weapons that has been agreed to by the governments of 98 percent of the world's people and approved overwhelmingly by the Congress of the United States is not enforced? Make no mistake -- this has implications beyond chemical warfare.  If we won't enforce accountability in the face of this heinous act, what does it say about our resolve to stand up to others who flout fundamental international rules?  To governments who would choose to build nuclear arms?  To terrorist who would spread biological weapons?  To armies who carry out genocide? We cannot raise our children in a world where we will not follow through on the things we say, the accords we sign, the values that define us. So just as I will take this case to Congress, I will also deliver this message to the world.  While the U.N. investigation has some time to report on its findings, we will insist that an atrocity committed with chemical weapons is not simply investigated, it must be confronted. I don't expect every nation to agree with the decision we have made.  Privately we've heard many expressions of support from our friends.  But I will ask those who care about the writ of the international community to stand publicly behind our action. And finally, let me say this to the American people:  I know well that we are weary of war.  We've ended one war in Iraq.  We're ending another in Afghanistan.  And the American people have the good sense to know we cannot resolve the underlying conflict in Syria with our military.  In that part of the world, there are ancient sectarian differences, and the hopes of the Arab Spring have unleashed forces of change that are going to take many years to resolve.  And that's why we're not contemplating putting our troops in the middle of someone else's war. Instead, we'll continue to support the Syrian people through our pressure on the Assad regime, our commitment to the opposition, our care for the displaced, and our pursuit of a political resolution that achieves a government that respects the dignity of its people. But we are the United States of America, and we cannot and must not turn a blind eye to what happened in Damascus.  Out of the ashes of world war, we built an international order and enforced the rules that gave it meaning.  And we did so because we believe that the rights of individuals to live in peace and dignity depends on the responsibilities of nations.  We aren't perfect, but this nation more than any other has been willing to meet those responsibilities. So to all members of Congress of both parties, I ask you to take this vote for our national security.  I am looking forward to the debate.  And in doing so, I ask you, members of Congress, to consider that some things are more important than partisan differences or the politics of the moment. Ultimately, this is not about who occupies this office at any given time; it's about who we are as a country.  I believe that the people's representatives must be invested in what America does abroad, and now is the time to show the world that America keeps our commitments.  We do what we say.  And we lead with the belief that right makes might -- not the other way around. We all know there are no easy options.  But I wasn't elected to avoid hard decisions.  And neither were the members of the House and the Senate.  I've told you what I believe, that our security and our values demand that we cannot turn away from the massacre of countless civilians with chemical weapons.  And our democracy is stronger when the President and the people's representatives stand together. I'm ready to act in the face of this outrage.  Today I'm asking Congress to send a message to the world that we are ready to move forward together as one nation. Thanks very much.","Obama calls attack of Syrian civilians 'an assault on human dignity'

"What's better than a ""supermoon""? Three supermoons! The full moons of this summer -- July 12, August 10 and September 9 -- are supermoons, as NASA calls them. The phenomenon happens when the moon becomes full on the same day as its perigee -- the point in the moon's orbit when it's closest to Earth. Supermoon linked to supercreativity? We think so . ""Generally speaking, full Moons occur near perigee every 13 months and 18 days, so it's not all that unusual,"" Geoff Chester of the U.S. Naval Observatory said in a statement from NASA. ""In fact, just last year there were three perigee Moons in a row, but only one was widely reported."" Chester was talking about the supermoon that happened in June last year.

""There's a part of me that wishes that this 'super-Moon' moniker would just dry up and blow away, like the 'Blood-Moon' that accompanied the most recent lunar eclipse, because it tends to promulgate a lot of mis-information,"" Chester said in his statement.

"Four Louisiana men have been arrested after 63 semi-automatic rifles were reported missing at a shipping warehouse, Caddo Parish Sheriff Steve Prator said Wednesday. On October 14, two days after a gun shipment arrived, officials at Con-way Freight in Shreveport learned that one of five pallets carrying the Colt AR-15s was missing. They were being shipped from Hartford, Connecticut, to a Shreveport-area gun distributor. None of the missing weapons have been recovered, authorities said. A news release from the sheriff's office said detectives and agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives questioned a contractor who was a security guard at the warehouse on the day the guns arrived. After his interview, the guard was arrested and booked for theft of a firearm, as were two other men. Authorities searched the home of a fourth man. No guns were found, but the man was arrested when police came across a 65-inch television they say was stolen from the warehouse the same day as the guns. The sheriff's statement described the rifles as ""black, 5.56 mm, semi-automatic with a law enforcement carbine and 16-inch barrel."" They are valued at $800 each. The release said it is possible some of the guns may have been sold to unwitting buyers.

"The Basque separatist group ETA announced Thursday a ""definitive cessation of its armed activity"" in a statement published on the website of Gara, a newspaper that the group has used to convey messages in the past. Listed as a terrorist organization by Spain, the United States and the European Union, ETA is blamed for hundreds of deaths in its decades-long fight for an independent Basque state that it wants carved out of sections of northern Spain and southwestern France. Thursday's announcement follows a recent push for the group to abandon violence permanently. That effort was led by international figures who include Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams of Northern Ireland and former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan. In a nationally televised address hours after the announcement was posted, Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero termed  ETA's announcement as being of ""transcendental importance"" and a ""victory for democracy."" ""Ours will be a democracy without terrorism, but not without memory,"" Zapatero said, referring to 829 people killed by ETA and their families. The prime minister praised Spanish police, Civil Guard personnel, the intelligence agency and judicial authorities ""who have contributed to this end."" Zapatero also singled out France -- which has traditionally been used as a rearguard base for ETA -- and its president, Nicolas Sarkozy, for their assistance. The prime minister said that it would be up to Spain's next government -- which will be formed after parliamentary elections on November 20 -- to lead the peace process. Zapatero, whose popular standing has soured amid Spain's deep economic crisis, is not running for a third term. Soon after he was first elected, in 2004, the police intensified their crackdown on ETA as the group's popularity among some segments of Basque society began to wane. In its own statement Thursday, ETA called of ""enormous significance"" a one-day meeting held Monday in which Adams, Annan and other leaders met in San Sebastian, a principal Basque city, and called for peace. After that conference -- which did not include representatives from the Spanish government, the Basque regional government or the main opposition party in Spain, the Popular Party -- former Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern read a statement calling for ETA to issue a declaration akin to what it made on Thursday. The leaders also called on the Spanish and French governments to welcome it and ""agree to talks exclusively to deal with the consequences of the conflict."" European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso hailed ETA's move Friday as ""a truly historic moment which ends years of terror and attacks on Spanish society."" The development ""marks the culmination of years of unceasing efforts in the fight against terrorism,"" he said, as he congratulated Spain on its efforts to combat ETA. Police have cracked down in recent years on ETA in Spain and France, leaving it operationally weak. There have been numerous statements from the Basque group calling for talks or a peace process of some sort, but all falling short of declaring a definitive end to violence. The Spanish government has said that since ETA has broken cease-fires in the past, only an authoritative statement that it is putting down its arms for good will do. In its statement Thursday, the group outlined why now was the right time to make such a declaration. ""A new political time is emerging in the Basque Country,"" ETA said. ""We have a historic opportunity to find a just and democratic solution for the centuries-old political conflict."" The group then added that ""dialogue and agreement"" should predominate ""over violence and repression."" ETA urged the Spanish and French governments to conduct ""direct dialogue"" aimed at addressing outstanding issues, while calling upon fellow Basques to commit to such a process. In remarks Thursday night at their respective political party headquarters in Madrid, the two main contenders to replace Zapatero cheered the development but did not detail what they would do next if they were to become prime minister. Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, the candidate from Zapatero's Socialist Party who until recently as Spain's interior minister led the fight against ETA, said the announcement ""puts an end to decades of broken lives."" He called unity among Spanish parties and leaders the ""key to this victory,"" and urged that this unified stance continue. ""Today, the ETA is not the protagonist, because the state of law has won,"" Rubalcaba said. Soon after, Mariano Rajoy -- who opinion polls show holds a commanding lead heading into next month's elections -- said that members of his conservative Popular Party take ""satisfaction"" from ETA's decision, which he insisted was not spurred by any political concessions. Rajoy called the announcement ""an important step,"" while adding that Spain would rest fully ""only when there is the definitive dissolution"" of ETA. Angeles Pedraza, the president of the Association of Victims of Terrorism, offered a similar stance in stating that her group will be satisfied only when ETA ""turns in its guns and disbands."" This sentiment was echoed by the leader of the moderate Basque Nationalist Party, Inigo Urkullu, who likewise called on the group to ""disarm and disband.""","European Commission chief Barroso hails a ""truly historic moment""

"A hidden bomb killed 30 Sunni worshipers, and wounded 52 others at a mosque near Baquba, Iraq, on Friday at 1 p.m., police and health officials said. The Abu al-Qassim Mohammed, a Sunni Mosque in Umm al-Adham district, is about 3 miles (5 kilometers) west of Baquba which is about 37 miles (60 kilometers) northeast of Baghdad. The bomb was hidden inside the mosque AC ducts and  stuffed with metal ball bearings, police officials told CNN. Today's attack that targeted  is the latest in a series of attacks targeting Sunni and Shiite mosques over the past few months. In a separate attack, a bomb in Qara Tapa, about 75 miles (120 kilometers) north of Baquba, killed one person and wounded four others at a Sunni mosque. In Mosul, about 400 km north of Baghdad, five people were killed in three separate incidents. The deadliest attack happened  when a car bomb exploded at the of the head of Nineveh provincial council's convoy and killed three of his bodyguards . On Wednesday a suicide bomber blew himself up amid a crowd of worshipers at a Shiite mosque in Baghdad, killing at least 30 people and wounding 55, police said . The bomber wore an explosive vest, which he detonated Wednesday evening in the northwestern al-Kassra neighborhood, police officials said. The force of the blast damaged not only the mosque, but several buildings nearby, police said. Iraq has seen a sharp increase in friction between its Shiite and Sunni populations since April, when Iraqi security forces raided a site used by Sunni protesters to demonstrate against the Shiite-led government. Sunnis have felt politically marginalized under Shiite President Nuri al-Maliki, whose government fears that Sunni Islamists involved in fighting in neighboring Syria are now targeting it. More than 800 Iraqis were killed and another 2,030 wounded in violence and acts of terrorism in August, the United Nations said.","Bomb was hidden in AC ducts of Sunni mosque .

"Ousted Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi is believed to be hiding out near the western town of Ghadamis under the protection of Tuareg fighters, an interim government military spokesman told CNN Tuesday. ""We have reliable information that Gadhafi is protected by the Tuareg tribe located between Niger, Algeria and Ghadamis town in Libya,"" said Col. Abdul Basit. He said Gadhafi's son Saif al-Islam is in Bani Walid, and another son, Mutassim, is in Sirte. Both cities remain contested. Basit did not say how the interim government discovered Gadhafi's putative whereabouts, and his assertions could not be verified. The National Transitional Council has made similar claims that proved false. Ghadamis is in western Libya, on the border with Algeria. Tuareg tribesmen have helped Gadhafi loyalists escape Libya across the expanses of the Sahel. During his rule, Gadhafi often turned to the nomadic Tuareg to bolster his forces and his attempts to manipulate and destabilize the poor countries to the south of Libya: Niger, Chad and Mali. The International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands, has issued arrest warrants for Moammar and Saif al-Islam Gadhafi. They are wanted for alleged crimes against humanity committed after the start of the Libyan uprising in February. After the fall of Tripoli to revolutionary forces, messages purportedly from Gadhafi were aired on Syrian-based television Al-Rai. The longtime dictator has not been seen in public for months. Libya's new leadership has been meeting in Benghazi to discuss the formation of an interim government. Meanwhile, battles are still raging in Sirte and Bani Walid; NATO estimates that 200,000 of Libya's 6 million people are still under threat from Gadhafi's supporters. Near Bani Walid's front line, senior National Transitional Council field commander Daou Al-Salhine Al Jadak was killed Tuesday, said Abdulla Kenshill, a spokesman in Bani Walid. ""A rocket struck a truck transporting Al Jadak and six of his aides,"" Kenshill said Wednesday. ""They are all Libyan martyrs of the revolution."" He described the humanitarian situation in Bani Walid as ""really bad"" and said 30,000 of the city's residents had fled toward Tripoli and 12,000 toward Sabha, in the south. Neither side appeared to be making headway in Bani Walid, he said. ""There are spies among our revolutionaries who send our coordinates to the snipers and Gadhafi loyalists firing from inside Bani Walid, and the proof is that their attacks have been precisely targeted,"" said Emad Ziglam, a field commander of the Tripoli rebels fighting outside Bani Walid. ""The mistake was mixing the rebel units. We should not have allowed fighters from Benghazi among others to join in, since we do not know them all. There are definitely traitors among us."" Thousands of people have fled the fighting in Sirte, the birthplace of Gadhafi, where the strongman retains a following. The National Transitional Council said that about 100 families left the city Wednesday. It also said Sirte was surrounded by revolutionary fighters but estimated that about 5,000 pro-Gadhafi fighters remained within the city. Transitional council military commanders Jamal al-Raies and Mohammed Ismael said its forces would wait a few days before starting any major offensive on the city in order to give civilians there more time to leave. Col. Ahmed Bani said anti-Gadhafi forces had taken control of the northern part of Sirte as well as its airport, its seaport and the Gardabya military base.","National Transitional Council commander is killed .

"Washington (CNN) -- Panicked as the FBI closed in Friday morning, Prince Georges County Executive Jack Johnson and his wife Leslie raced to find a $100,000 check for an alleged kickback and flush it down the toilet. With agents knocking at the door, Leslie Johnson stuffed nearly $80,000 in her bra. The dramatic end to an alleged years-long kickback scheme is outlined in detail in an affidavit written by FBI investigator Wendy Munoz, whose team was monitoring wiretaps. Johnson, who has served as the executive of Prince Georges County since 2002, was taken into custody along with his wife. The Johnsons made a first appearance in federal court late Friday in Greenbelt, Maryland, just outside Washington. They were both charged with tampering with evidence and destruction of records. U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein stressed the investigation is continuing. The Johnsons were released on their own recognizance, but Jack Johnson will be required to wear a monitoring device. He presumably will be allowed to continue serving out the last weeks of his expiring term as county executive if he chooses. The judge, however, ordered him not to attempt to destroy any evidence. Jack Johnson had been the Prince Georges County prosecutor prior to his eight years as executive. Leslie Johnson was just recently elected to the nine-member Prince Georges County Council. The ten-page affidavit says the FBI began investigating Johnson in 2006 when it learned that certain real estate developers were paying Johnson for contracts. That led to a ""a series of authorizations for the interception of wire communications."" The frantic end began early Friday when Johnson allegedly received a $15,000 payoff, and the FBI suddenly barged into the room to demand an explanation. Johnson told them the cash was for a party marking the end of his tenure as county executive. He also claimed he had no dealings with the developer who was with him. The FBI says Johnson made a series of false statements. The agents let him go but then eavesdropped on a series of frantic phone calls between Jack and Leslie Johnson as Jack Johnson and the FBI headed for the Johnsons' Mitchellville, Maryland, home. ""Two women (agents) are at the door,"" Leslie told her husband. ""Don't answer it,"" Jack said. He told her to run upstairs to their bedroom and go to ""my drawer."" ""You will see a check in there that [an unidentified developer] wrote to me,"" he said. The affidavit says when Leslie found the check Jack told her to tear it up. ""Do you want me to put it down the toilet?"" she asked. Jack Johnson replied, ""Yes, flush that."" The agents monitoring the phone calls heard a flushing sound. Leslie Johnson grabbed cash from the bedroom and also ran to the basement and grabbed more cash. ""Put in your bra and walk out or something, I don't know what to do, Jack said. ""I have it in my bra,"" his wife replied. ""FBI agents then searched the person of Leslie Johnson incident to her arrest and recovered $79,600 in U.S. currency from her underwear,"" the affidavit says. The wild ending may end up costing the Johnsons. The FBI says there is probable cause to believe that the pair ""tampered with ... evidence and engaged in destruction, alteration, and falsification of records in a federal investigation."" The FBI document does not say how much money Johnson may have received in kickbacks or bribes. It does say at least some of the funds involved were targeted from an $80 million dollar budget to programs supported by federal grants such as those from Department of Housing and Community Development.","NEW: Johnsons are charged with tampering with evidence and destruction of records .

"Keep your carry-ons small on Allegiant Air flights. Starting Wednesday, if your bag doesn't fit under the seat, you're going to pay for it. The airline plans to charge between $10 and $30 for carry-on luggage stored in overhead bins on flights booked after the fee is implemented overnight. Those prices apply for fees paid during the reservation process and vary by route. Previous bookings will not be affected. Carry-on fees on most routes will be less than $15, the airline said. Passengers who pay fees at the airport during check-in will be charged $35. Personal items that fit under seats are still free. Allegiant's CEO said the airline's fares are still lower than competitors'. ""When it is all said and done and you get to the bottom line and hit the 'pay' button, and you can shop our fares against anybody else. We are typically 50% lower,"" CEO Maurice Gallagher said. Rising fuel prices are to blame for the hefty fee, says one industry expert. ""Allegiant has one of the oldest and most fuel-inefficient fleets in the airline industry,"" said Vaughn Cordle, an analyst with AirlineForecasts. Allegiant joins Spirit Airlines as the second U.S. carrier to implement fees for carry-on luggage. In April 2010, Spirit announced carry-on charges from $20 to $45 for bags stored in the overhead bins. Spirit declined to comment Tuesday on revenue generated by its carry-on fee, but the policy has been ""very well received by our customers and our crew members,"" spokeswoman Misty Pinson said via e-mail. ""It has resulted in a much speedier, smoother and safer boarding and deplaning."" Overall, U.S. airlines racked up $2.6 billion in baggage fee revenue in 2011, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. An ultra-low-fare model gives carriers such as Allegiant and Spirit more flexibility in unbundling the costs of air travel, Cordle said, but other airlines will be watching the carry-on fee closely. ""They're all trying to move that route, but it's a little harder for the higher-cost network airlines to tack on higher fees associated with getting passengers from A to B,"" Cordle said. But ""if they think they can get away with it, they're going to do it."" George Hobica, founder of Airfarewatchdog.com, agrees. ""It's a distinct possibility. Monkey see, monkey do. Clearly, Spirit Airlines didn't go bust for doing so, and now Allegiant is dipping its toes into the water,"" Hobica said via e-mail. ""Since there's no regulation banning such a fee, and especially because overhead bin space has not kept up with demand from passengers trying to avoid fees (leading to countless fights and unpleasantness for both passengers and crew) I don't see why at least one legacy carrier wouldn't try it."" US Airways, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines said Tuesday that they have no plans to charge for carry-ons. Delta said it doesn't comment on future fares or fees.","Allegiant Air is the second U.S. airline to charge for carry-on bags .

"Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou is faced with a hugely delicate balancing act: the need to maintain good economic relations with China while trying to keep Beijing's push for reunification at bay. The latter has become an increasingly tense issue. During a recent session with reporters in the presidential office building, Ma leaned back in a dark-blue armchair under an oil painting of Sun Yat-sen -- modern China's founding father whose legacy is claimed by Taipei  and Beijing-- and delivered a clear message: economic relations with China should be developed but not at the cost of sovereignty. ""During my tenure as president, I will not discuss unification with mainland China,"" he declared. But he added that he would ""not promote independence, let alone the use of force"" either. ""I believe this is essential to achieving a stable and lasting framework for peaceful development,"" he said. Ma says his government is watching pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong closely to see whether Beijing will honor its initial promises on universal suffrage. The city is regarded as a testing ground for the ""one country, two systems"" formula that China's leaders originally hoped would entice Taiwan back into the fold. China and Taiwan -- officially the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China -- separated in 1949 following a civil war. But China still claims Taiwan as its territory and, to this day, is reported to have missiles pointed at the island. Ma said he does ""not fear that Taiwan will become a second Hong Kong,"" as the two were completely different cases. He also admitted a soft spot for the former British colony that was also his birthplace. ""I feel a close affinity with Hong Kong."" One country, two systems . Xi Jinping, China's most powerful president in decades, has brought new urgency to the unification issue by stating that the problem should not be pushed from generation to generation. In September, he expressed his ""firm and unwavering stance"" on reunification under the idea of ""one country, two systems"" during a meeting with pro-unification delegates in Beijing. Within hours, Ma rejected the idea as ""unacceptable."" During the interview, Ma acknowledged his counterpart in Beijing has a more ""high-handed posture"" than his predecessors. And in a speech on the island's national day October 10, he urged Xi to introduce democracy for his 1.3 billion people -- letting free elections in Hong Kong be the first step. Ma has also encouraged mainland Chinese exchange students to study in Taiwan to experience its open society. ""We have never wistfully thought that mainland China would become democratized quickly,"" he said. ""All our efforts in Taiwan have aimed at showing ethnic Chinese societies around the world that the imported concept of democracy can take root, germinate, and grow into a big tree on purely ethnic Chinese soil."" Chinese state media last week accused Taiwan of recruiting mainland students studying on the island as spies. Soon after, Taiwan banned senior officials from studying in China for ""national security"" reasons. 'Coddling tyrants?' Despite his firm position against reunification, Ma, who took office 2008, has made more of an attempt to ease tensions with the mainland than any of his predecessors -- mainly by creating closer business relations and signing a total of 21 cooperative agreements, including the ground-breaking Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement, ECFA. Many Taiwanese companies have moved factories to China, while Chinese banks now operate on the island. Six years ago no direct flights existed between the island and the mainland; today there are hundreds of flight a week and tourists are flooding in. Victor Teo of the University of Hong Kong said Taiwan's leader is making progress as he negotiates the thin line between economic pragmatism and sovereignty. ""Ma is doing more for Taiwan in terms of democratization, economic development and the preservation of autonomy than he would if he took the position of his predecessors,"" he said. ""I personally have a very high opinion of President Ma, and I think he has the balance right. His main difficulties are being accused of 'coddling the tyrants in Beijing' of course."" But his critics say the relationship with Beijing has become too cozy. Last spring, hundreds of students of the so-called ""Sunflower Movement"" occupied Taiwan's parliament in protest. That led to a major trade agreement being blocked and a new souring of relations with China. Ketty Chen, deputy director of international affairs for the opposition pro-independent Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), said in a recent interview that the 21 cross-strait agreements were signed too hastily and without proper review. Taiwanese or Chinese? Today, less than 10% of people support the idea of immediate or eventual reunification -- a figure that has declined consistently over the years. Results of a survey by National Chengchi University in June found that 60% of respondents identified as Taiwanese -- an historic high -- compared to just 3.5% as Chinese. A clear majority supports the political status quo of de facto independence. Now, with Beijing rejecting true democracy in Hong Kong -- despite a public backlash -- the idea of ""one country, two systems,"" seems even more unappealing to the people of Taiwan. ""The leaders in Beijing are afraid that if they give democracy to Hong Kong, then other parts of China, like Xinjiang and Tibet, will also ask for it,"" said a 17-year old female high school student who lives in Taipei. ""I hope Taiwan never in my life time reunifies with China. It would be very bad. We would lose our freedom."" Her words echoed those of many ordinary people I spoke to in Taipei. ""Many people in Taiwan want independence,"" said a young woman called Febie who manages a small café in Taipei, Taiwan's capital. ""But that's impossible without the backing of other powerful countries, like the United States. I still think President Ma should be stronger against China."" Kristian McGuire, an independent, Washington-based researcher and volunteer with Taiwan Security Research, says that if peaceful unification is going to happen, it is going to have to come through a democratic process whereby millions of Taiwanese choose to join China. ""Thus far, it looks like most Taiwanese don't want reunification so long as China remains an authoritarian state with little respect for human rights,"" he said.","Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou was discussing relations with mainland China .
President Ma: I will not discuss reunification, promote independence .

"(CNN) -- New Orleans Saints running back Reggie Bush announced Tuesday that he would forfeit the Heisman Trophy he won in 2005 when he was at the University of Southern California. ""I will forever appreciate the honor bestowed upon me as a winner of the Heisman,"" Bush wrote in a statement released by his pro team, the New Orleans Saints. ""While this decision is heart-breaking, I find solace in knowing that the award was made possible by the support and love of so many. Those are gifts that can never be taken away."" Bush, who skipped his senior season at USC to enter the National Football League draft, has been under a cloud since an NCAA investigation led to harsh sanctions against his alma mater. The investigation found that two would-be sports agents lavished gifts on the star and his family and that at least one member of the Trojans coaching staff knew about it. The NCAA gave the school four years of probation, forced it to vacate its last two wins of the 2004 season, including the 2005 Orange Bowl, and all of its wins in 2005. The school is banned from bowl games in 2010 and 2011 and cannot associate itself with Bush. Additionally, running backs coach Todd McNair has been banned from off-campus recruiting. The punishments were announced in June. ""The persistent media speculation regarding allegations dating back to my years at USC has been both painful and distracting,"" Bush said in a statement released by the Saints. ""In no way should the storm around these allegations reflect in any way on the dignity of this award, nor on any other institutions or individuals. Nor should it distract from outstanding performances and hard-earned achievements either in the past, present or future."" The NCAA ruled that Bush lost his eligibility to play college football in December 2004. The Heisman Trophy Trust, which administers the award, has been conducting its own investigation. From December 2004, the sports agents, who were hoping to represent Bush in the NFL draft, allegedly paid for hotel rooms, rent on a home where Bush's family lived and a limousine ride to accept the Heisman in December 2005. But such payments are not allowed under NCAA rules. In his statement, Bush said he wanted to turn ""a negative situation into a positive one by working with the Trustees to establish an educational program which will assist student-athletes and their families avoid some of the mistakes that I made."" ""I am determined to view this event as an opportunity to help others and to advance the values and mission of the Heisman Trophy Trust,"" he said. The Heisman ""recognizes the outstanding college football player whose performance best exhibits the pursuit of excellence with integrity,"" according to the award's website. ""Winners epitomize great ability combined with diligence, perseverance and hard work."" Bush helped lead the Saints to their first Super Bowl victory during the 2009-2010 season.","NCAA investigation: Reggie Bush received payments, gifts while playing at USC .

"There's been no shortage of news coverage of the atrocities carried out by ISIS against the people of Iraq and Syria, from beheadings to massacres to selling kidnapped women into sexual slavery. What's less well known is the devastation the Sunni extremist group is wreaking on Iraq's priceless cultural heritage. Thousands of years before the birth of Christ, the people of Mesopotamia mastered the first writing system, mathematics, astronomy, literature and law. Iraq's past, however, is threatened by the nightmare of its present. ISIS is not only at war with the Iraqi state, it's also at war with Iraq's very identity -- blowing up religious shrines, slaughtering and enslaving minorities such as the Yazidis, Christians and Turkmen, and executing its enemies. And what it hasn't destroyed, ISIS is selling on the black market. Qais Hussain Rashid, director general of Iraqi museums, told CNN of the depredations carried out by ISIS militants. ""They cut these reliefs and sell them to criminals and antique dealers,"" he said, gesturing toward an ornate carving dating back thousands of years. ""Usually they cut off the head, leaving the legs, because the head is the valuable part."" Ancient city of Hatra at risk . The area around Iraq's northern city of Mosul, overrun by ISIS in June as Iraqi army soldiers fled, is replete with ancient ruins -- now in peril. Rashid has particular fears about the preservation of the ancient ruined city of Hatra, or al-Hadr in Arabic, which dates back to the third century B.C. and is south of Mosul. ISIS took over the site a few months ago, using it to store weapons and ammunition, to train fighters and to execute prisoners. Established by the successors of Alexander the Great, Hatra became the capital of what some believe to be an early Arab kingdom that also included the fabled city of Petra in Jordan, according to the museum. It withstood attacks by the Roman Empire before falling in the third century A.D. to the Persian Sassanid Empire. Standing within inner and outer walls studded by scores of towers are large numbers of architectural treasures reflecting its long and diverse history. ""There are palaces, temples and statues there, and ISIS is living among them,"" Rashid said. ""I'm afraid they'll do something crazy there."" ISIS has also taken over Mosul Museum, turning it into an office to collect jizya -- a tax levied by the militant group on non-Muslims. The fate of the antiquities there is unknown. 'People from another planet' The U.N. cultural agency UNESCO has sounded the alarm over Hatra and other sites in Iraq, saying their preservation will play a role in any future peace. ""Protecting the lives of people, their cultural heritage and identity go hand in hand,"" the agency's director general, Irina Bokova, said at an emergency meeting in July. She pledged that UNESCO would mobilize the United Nations ""and the whole international community to safeguard Iraq's cultural heritage with particular emphasis on the fight against illicit trafficking in cultural property."" But while the conflict still rages, little can be done to protect artifacts on the ground. This isn't the first time that Iraq's precious cultural wealth has been under threat. The country's history is full of catastrophes. One of the worst was the Mongol sacking of Baghdad in 1258, when it's said the Tigris River ran red and black, with blood and the ink of thousands of priceless manuscripts. But to Rashid, the Mongols' barbarity pales in comparison with that of ISIS. ""They are people from another planet,"" he says. ""They take pride in nothing. Their mentality is completely petrified. They don't think of all this as the accomplishments of humanity.""","Museums director Qais Hussain Rashid says ISIS militants are destroying antiquities .

"If you contacted the federal Obamacare call center early Thursday morning, you may have been told that your password for Healthcare.gov needed to be reset. But that is not the case, officials from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services say. Consumer passwords for the Obamacare website have not been reset, HHS officials say, but call center representatives were mistakenly given that incorrect information.

Please stay on this page. We're working to make the experience better, and we don't want you to lose your place in line. We'll send you to the login page as soon as we can. Thanks for your patience!"" Healthcare.gov  is handling Obamacare enrollment for 36 states that didn't fully establish their own insurance exchanges, also called marketplaces. Federal officials blamed higher-than-expected traffic volume for the first day glitches -- on October 1, some 4.7 million people visited HealthCare.gov and 133,000 contacted the call center at 1-800-318-2596. But for the last 10 days, visitors to Healthcare.gov have continued to experience slow connection speeds and error messages preventing them from purchasing insurance. HHS has been taking down parts of the site during off-peak hours to make improvements by adding more server capacity; moving certain over-stressed components to dedicated hardware; and making software changes to increase efficiency. A specific software component that crashed under the high volume of visitors is mainly to blame for the glitches, a federal official confirmed to CNN on Tuesday. ""At lower volumes, this software component would work fine, and at higher volume, that's what created the problems,"" the official said.

"The checkered career of scandal-hit former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn is set to take another turn, with the news Friday that he is to become an economic adviser to the Serbian government. The appointment will be announced next week, an official in the Serbian Deputy Prime Minister's Office told CNN. She was not named in line with government policy. ""The exact details still have to be worked out, but we will have more information on Tuesday,"" the official said. ""Mr. Strauss-Kahn will come to Serbia from time to time, but I don't think he will live here."" Asked why the government had chosen Strauss-Kahn, she said, ""Because he is an expert in the field of economics."" The government declined to give out any more details ahead of Tuesday's announcement. Strauss-Kahn, once considered a likely candidate for the French presidency, resigned as head of the International Monetary Fund in 2011 after being charged with sexually assaulting a New York City maid. All sexual assault charges against him related to the maid were later dismissed at the request of a prosecutor. Strauss-Kahn: A reputation battered by sex allegations . More than a year later, in December 2012, Strauss-Kahn reached a settlement with the maid, the terms of which were not released. He told CNN's Richard Quest in an interview in July that he had opted to ""pay and go on with my life,"" rather than spend more in legal fees fighting the civil case. The 64-year-old told CNN he sometimes gives advice for free to less economically developed countries and had recently been working with the government of South Sudan. In France, Strauss-Kahn is among a number of people charged with aggravated pimping in an investigation into sex parties at the Hotel Carlton, in the northern city of Lille. CNN affiliate BFM-TV said a trial was likely to be held next year. Strauss-Kahn did not deny attending the parties, his lawyers said, but he said he did not know that the young women at the parties were being paid for sex.","Deputy Prime Minister's Office official: He'll work with government on economic affairs .

"Shweyga Mullah's face lights up with a smile that spreads like a sunrise across her face. She's just arrived at a party, organized by the small Ethiopian community on Malta. It's the first time she's seen many of her new friends since being discharged from hospital last week. They raise paper cups of soda in a toast and Shweyga bashfully takes the salute and laughs and jokes with her fellow Ethiopians. It's heart-warming to see her finally enjoying herself. All her Ethiopian friends here had been lured to Libya by promises of lucrative work. But no one we know of has suffered quite like Shweyga. One friend Emanuel Tsegay tells me that on hearing Shweyga's story he burst into tears. Shweyga's unbelievably awful story of torture at the hands of Colonel Moammar Gadhafi's daughter-in-law Aline has touched people around the world and resulted in some $40,000 being donated to a special fund for her recovery. We found Shweyga abandoned in a Gadhafi family compound in August. Lying alone on a mattress on the floor, she told me how Aline Gadhafi and one of her staff poured boiling water over her head and body, simply because she'd been unable to stop one of the Gadhafi children from crying. Offers of help poured into CNN Center and resulted in her evacuation to the tiny Mediterranean nation of Malta. She arrived here in September and has undergone surgery and skin grafts since then. Now though, surgeons are satisfied enough with her progress to allow her to become an outpatient. She's staying at a small apartment on the island and is receiving some financial help from the Qatari government, which has helped bankroll the Libyan revolution and arm its fighters. Shweyga's life here is not ideal though. She yearns to see her family, but red-tape has slowed down efforts to bring her relatives to Malta. Shweyga says she doesn't feel ready physically or emotionally to return to Ethiopia and be subjected to the scrutiny of people in her hometown. She remains profoundly self-conscious of her appearance. But the doctors and nurses treating her at the Mater Dei hospital are pleased with her recovery. Nurse Mary Rose Bonnici has been treating her since she arrived. We watched as she delicately trimmed the growing crown of hair on her scalp. It's growing back fast but for now it must be kept short, in order to prevent infection. Nurse Bonnici says: ""She is making very good progress. It was discharging before now it's getting drier and drier. But now it's good, very good, she feels it's good anyway."" The consultant in charge of her case, Francis Xavier Dermanin, says: ""Ms. Mullah had regular physiotherapy for mobilization of her limbs especially the right shoulder which showed signs of early contractures due to immobility from the burns that she had sustained. ""She also had the support of our psychologists in helping her to get over the horrific trauma that she had sustained. In both aspects she did very well. ""In general, Ms. Mullah is more confident and communicating well with the medical and nursing staff."" It's encouraging that her hair is growing back in places on her head. But the hair follicles towards the front, where the skin graft was performed, seem to have been permanently killed off. The doctors hope there are enough towards the back to enable her to grow her hair out and disguise the scars. I ask Shweyga about Aline Gadhafi and she speaks rapidly and with conviction. She hopes the former dictator's daughter-in-law will one day be caught and prosecuted. But like her husband Hannibal Gadhafi, Aline's whereabouts remains unknown. Victims like Shweyga are still waiting for justice.","A nanny left disfigured by the Gadhafi family has left hospital in Malta .

"The village of Asola-Fatehpur Beri is the strongest in India. For generations, men have held two-hour workouts every morning and evening in this countryside community on the southern rim of Delhi. From pre-teens to men nearing 50, bodybuilders sweat it out at one of the most popular training spots, Akhada, which is a Hindi word that means wrestling arena. This is where brawny men wrestle in mud, climb ropes and perform a few hundred sit-ups and push-ups, balancing their hands on bricks. They carry each other on their shoulders -- all part of the traditional Indian way of working out. One lifts a 350 kilogram (771 pound) motorcycle up to his chest. The group of about 40 males exercises outside, each wearing a simple loincloth. ""They eat healthy and on time, they practice here everyday, and that's why they are so strong,"" says Vijay Tanwar, the head-trainer at Akhada. The musclemen of Asola-Fatehpur Beri are capitalizing on their brawn by working as bouncers in New Delhi's clubs and bars. As more nightspots open in India's capital, there's a greater need for men to guard the doors, and the musclemen from this rural village are filling most of that demand. Profitable muscle . Tanwar is credited with starting this new trend. Fifteen years ago, he missed out on a place in India's wrestling team for the Olympics. He says he was looking for an opportunity where he could use his muscle and power, and so took a job as a bouncer. ""I was the first bouncer from this village,"" he claims. ""Then everyone followed my path. More than 300 musclemen work as bouncers in New Delhi's clubs and bars now."" They've learned that pumping iron is a way to stay fit and earn a living. ""As they say health is wealth. We are healthy but we're also earning good money, able to send kids to good schools, eat well -- what else does one need in life?"" he says. Building muscle isn't only about becoming a bouncer in Delhi. Disciplined training is very important for these men and part of a tradition in the village. ""There are few modern gyms in the village, but most men prefer the traditional style of working out,"" Tanwar says. ""It makes your body flexible and the risk of injury is less as well."" The musclemen don't drink or smoke. And the majority of them are vegetarians with diets that consist mostly of fruit, nuts, yogurts and lots of milk. ""We do not consume any muscle enhancing supplements,"" Tanwar says. Building muscle in a new generation . Urged by his parents, Sonu Tanwar, 19, gets up at 5 a.m. to go running and then to the Akhada. Tanwar, who represents the younger generation of bodybuilders, says: ""I want to be a great wrestler and make my parents proud. I play in the 66 kilogram category and have won several championships."" Instilling a habit of working out in young males is important, says Guru Lekhraj, a 75-year-old native of the Asola-Fatehpur village. ""Children are prone to bad behavior between the age of 17 and 27, but if we get the child interested in physical exercise and good health, bad behavior will not be an influence. This is what our ancestors have taught us as well. Who will teach if not the elders?"" Lekhraj comes to the Akhada often to observe the men working out. He's a respected figure among the musclemen, and is considered the bodybuilding guru of the village. ​ . Due to Lekhraj's age, he cannot participate in training anymore but says he is very happy the young generation is continuing the legacy. ""What mother doesn't want her son to be strong, well-built, handsome and smart?"" Lekhraj says. In the case of Asola-Fatehpur Beri, bodybuilding also means building a legacy.","Men gather for four hours each day to exercise in rural village Asola-Fatehpur Beri .

"A self-styled Islamist preacher accused of beating and torturing his 5-year-old daughter to death was sentenced Monday to eight years in prison and 600 lashes, and was ordered to pay ""blood money"" to the girl's mother, according to an official with a government-backed human rights body. A Saudi court in the town of Hawta found Fayhan al-Ghamdi guilty on Monday, Mohammed Almadi of Saudi Arabia's Human Rights Commission told CNN. Read more: Small protests have big impact in Saudi Arabia . ""The girl's mother ceded her original request to sentence the father to death,"" explained Almadi, citing a lawyer for his group who was in the courtroom. ""She has since asked for the father to pay her blood money instead, which is her right in the Saudi legal system."" CNN was unable to reach Saudi Arabia's Justice Ministry for comment. Al-Ghamdi's daughter, Lama, was admitted to King Saud Hospital in Riyadh in March 2012 after suffering extensive injuries, including broken ribs, a crushed skull, bruising and burns. Family, activists and officials say she died of her wounds in late October last year. The case caused international outrage once it made headlines in February. ""My dear child is dead, and all I want now is justice so I can close my eyes and know she didn't die in vain,"" the mother, Syeda Mohammed Ali, told CNN in February. ""She was brutally tortured in the most shocking ways."" Ali, who is divorced from al-Ghamdi, said Lama's torture occurred while she was staying with her father. She added that al-Ghamdi is now remarried with two more children. Activists say al-Ghamdi is an Islamist evangelist popular in Saudi Arabia for his televised appearances and for speaking on air about the rewards of repenting to God. But they also say he only fancies himself a cleric and is not recognized by the clerical establishment. In a conservative country where the death penalty is common, Saudi social media users were quick to express disgust at the news. ""What kind of verdict is this?"" tweeted one. ""This is not justice,"" tweeted another. Some pointed out what they called a travesty -- that killing Lama garnered al-Ghamdi a punishment similar to that received by a Saudi activist, Raif Badawi, who was recently sentenced to seven years in jail and 600 lashes. Badawi was convicted of violating the nation's anti-cybercrime law by running an unauthorized Web forum. ""This guy, who tortured and killed his daughter, he gets eight years in jail and 600 lashes? You gotta be kidding me -- it's just a joke,"" said Manal Al-Sharif, a prominent Saudi women's rights activist. Saudi Twitter users expressed anger by comparing al-Ghamdi's verdict to another recent Saudi case -- one in which it was reported that four Saudi men accused of dancing naked on the roof of a car and posting a video of the incident online were sentenced to as many as 2,000 lashes and up to 10 years in prison, as well as being fined thousands of dollars.

If you look at the pictures of the girl in the hospital, unconscious for eight months before she passed away ... Saudi society never seen anything as ugly as that,"" al-Sharif said. Several activists and numerous local media had reported that Lama was also raped, but her mother denied that happened. Ali said that Lama's father was concerned about the virginity of his 5-year-old daughter. ""The father confessed to the abuse, the beating and torturing Lama in the most obnoxious manners,"" she said last February. One thing she said he did was to burn Lama's rectum. ""These are not some unfounded accusations, but everything is based on the medical examination by the hospital and the team of physicians who treated Lama when she was first admitted,"" she said.","Sentencing is met with disgust among Saudi social media users .

"U.S. transportation safety investigators arrived on Thursday in Afghanistan to try and help determine why a civilian operated Boeing 747 cargo jet crashed on takeoff from Bagram Air Base, killing all seven crew aboard. Senior aviation investigator Tim LeBaron is leading a team from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) that is working with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Boeing, which made the jumbo jet that crashed on Monday. The safety board is an independent government agency that investigates transportation accidents in the United States and often assists foreign governments in major cases, especially in air crashes involving a plane made by an American manufacturer. Afghanistan's transportation ministry is leading the probe, the safety board said in a statement. A priority for crash investigators is to recover the jet's ""black boxes,"" the flight data and cockpit voice recorders that could provide clues to a potential cause. The final moments of the doomed plane appear to have been captured by a dashboard camera inside a vehicle that was in the area. The approximately three-minute video shows what appears to be the jet starting its climb at 11:20 a.m. local time from the base. About 12 seconds into the video, it appears to stall, rolls from side to side, and drops. At 23 seconds, the plane crashes nose first into the ground off the side of the road, erupting into a ball of orange flame and black smoke. There is no immediate reaction from inside the vehicle. After the driver brings the vehicle equipped with the webcam to a halt, at 1:15  in the video, someone says, ""Oh, f***!"" At 1:33, as the camera shows the vehicle moving once again, a noise can be heard -- possibly from a dog. Someone says, ""All right, come here. Shh! Shh! Shh!"" The yelping stops; the vehicle stops. At 2:13 in the video, the vehicle approaches the crash site and stops, the camera once again capturing thick black smoke. The video ends. ""That's one dramatic fall out of the sky,"" said Arthur Rosenberg, a pilot, engineer and partner with the New York-based law firm Soberman & Rosenberg, which specializes in litigation stemming from plane crashes. ""It could have been a rock."" He added, ""The plane just flat-out stalled. There's absolutely no question about that."" He said too much cargo in the rear of the plane is one of several possible causes. ""It looks to me like the plane pitched up; the most likely cause would be too much load in the rear,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""The plane dropped below minimum controllable airspeed and started to roll."" But, he added, ""It's way too early to tell."" CNN cannot confirm the video's authenticity. It bears the date 2013/02/01, but date stamps can easily be inaccurate. Ill-fated Flight NCR102 was operated by National Airlines, which specializes in moving freight for the military and businesses. It also operates charter passenger service in the Middle East. U.S.-based National Air Cargo, the parent of National Airlines, confirmed the crash. It said the flight originated at Camp Bastian, a military base in Afghanistan, and was en route to Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It had stopped to refuel at Bagram, landing uneventfully. The cargo included five mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicles being taken out of Afghanistan as part of the drawdown of U.S. forces, said Shirley Kaufman of National Air Cargo. The vehicles, usually referred to as MRAPs, can weigh from 12 tons to 24 tons, depending on the model, according to a 2011 Congressional Research Service report. That would mean a minimum of 60 tons, which is within its specifications, according to Boeing. ""Securing them is absolutely critical to safety,"" said Steven Wallace, former director of the FAA's Accident Investigation Unit. It's critical that the total weight be within the limit and that the plane be balanced, he said. ""When the airplane is rotated with the nose up, the cargo moves aft if it's not properly secured,"" he said. National Air Cargo said the cargo was properly loaded and secured and had passed all necessary inspections prior to departing Camp Bastian. No additional cargo was added during the stop in Bagram and the aircraft's cargo was again inspected prior to departure. The company would not speculate on a possible cause of the crash and said it was cooperating with investigators. Six of the crash victims were from Michigan, National said. They were identified as Brad Hasler, Jeremy Lipka, Jamie Brokaw, Rinku Summan, Michael Sheets and Gary Stockdale. The other victim, Timothy Garrett, was from Kentucky. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said his group shot down the aircraft and that ""several foreign soldiers were killed."" That claim could not be verified. A number of Taliban claims of responsibility have proven false.","A video appears to show the 747 as it tries to take off from Bagram Airbase .

"(CNN) -- A man accused of killing a 7-year-old girl more than 50 years ago was charged Wednesday with being a fugitive by a Seattle, Washington, district court. Jack Daniel McCullough, 71, was arrested last week at his home in Seattle. He was charged Friday in the connection with the death and disappearance of Maria Ridulph in 1957 in his hometown of Sycamore, Illinois. At a hearing Monday, a judge set McCullough's bail at $3 million. Wednesday's new charge is a holding charge that will allow Washington police to continue keep McCullough in custody until he returns to Illinois where he will be prosecuted. More than 50 years ago, Ridulph was abducted while playing with her friend, Cathy Sigman, near their homes in Illinois. Sigman told police that she and her friend were approached by a man in his early 20s wearing a multi-colored sweater who identified himself as ""Johnny,"" according to the probable cause statement that led to McCullough's arrest. Sigman told police the man gave Ridulph a piggy-back ride and then asked the girls if they had dolls, the documents state. While Ridulph went home to get a doll for ""Johnny,"" Sigman said the man touched her on the arm and thigh, but their interaction went no further. Afterwards, she said she went inside her home to get mittens and when she returned, Ridulph and ""Johnny"" were gone. After ignoring Sigman's initial reports that her friend had disappeared, a massive search went out to find Ridulph. Soon after the FBI became involved and agents sent daily reports to then FBI director J. Edgar Hoover. Ridulph's skeletal remains were found on April 26, 1958, about 120 miles from where she disappeared. McCullough, who then went by John Tessier, was an initial suspect, but he had an alibi. He told police that he was in Rockford, Illinois at a military recruiting station on the evening of Ridulph's disappearance. McCullough said he had been given a train ticket from Rockford to Chicago by the military. After the session, he said he returned home and went on a date with his girlfriend. Police re-interviewed his then-girlfriend in 2010 and asked if she had any photos of McCullough. While showing police her pictures, the woman discovered an unused train ticket from Rockford to Chicago that she said he had given her on the date of the crime. The discovery led to McCullough's arrest and eventual charge, according to court documents. Shortly after Ridulph's disappearance, McCullough was accepted by the Air Force and legally changed his name from John Tessier to Jack Daniel McCullough. He eventually transferred to the Army and was assigned to Fort Lewis in Washington. He has been living in Seattle. At a hearing Monday, McCullough's attorney told the judge his client doesn't acknowledge that he is who the state claims he is, according to CNN affiliate KOMO in Seattle. Last September, investigators tracked down Cathy Sigman, now in her 60s, and showed her some old photos of men who fit the description of John Tessier, aka McCullough. ""That's him,"" she said, according to the probable cause statement that led to McCullough's arrest. ""To the best of my memory and recollection of that night, that's him.""","Jack Daniel McCullough is accused of killing a 7-year-old girl five decades ago .

"Three members of Russian female punk rock band Pussy Riot were sentenced to two years in prison Friday after they were found guilty of hooliganism for performing a song critical of President Vladimir Putin in a church. The five months they have spent in detention since their arrests in March count toward the sentence, Judge Marina Sirovaya said. The judge said the charges against the three young women -- Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, Maria Alyokhina and Yekaterina Samutsevich -- had been proved by witnesses and the facts. The Pussy Riot members were charged after screaming, ""Mother Mary, please drive Putin away,"" in a protest act in February inside Christ Savior Cathedral, one of Moscow's grandest houses of worship. Punk bands perform in support of jailed rockers . Sirovaya rejected the women's defense that they were acting from political motives, ruling that they had intended to insult the Russian Orthodox Church and undermine public order. However, the fact that two of them have young children was a mitigating factor in the sentencing, the judge said. The defendants were accused of offending the churchgoers present -- through their actions, obscene language and their clothing -- and showing a lack of respect for the rules of the Orthodox Church. They ignored requests to stop their brief unscheduled protest performance, the court heard. While their actions outraged many of Russia's faithful, their high-profile trial prompted international concern about freedom of speech in Russia. Opinion: Why the Pussy Riot case matters . The U.S. Embassy in Moscow said on its official Twitter feed that the sentence was ""disproportionate."" European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton condemned the court's decision as ""deeply troubling."" ""Together with the reports of the band members' mistreatment during their pre-trial detention and the reported irregularities of the trial, it puts a serious question mark over Russia's respect for international obligations of fair, transparent, and independent legal process,"" she said. Pussy Riot and Russia's surreal 'justice' ""It also runs counter to Russia's international obligations as regards respect for freedom of expression."" Urging Russia to reverse the sentence, Ashton said the case ""adds to the recent upsurge in politically motivated intimidation and prosecution of opposition activists in the Russian Federation, a trend that is of growing concern to the European Union."" Rights group Amnesty International said that the court's decision was ""a bitter blow for freedom of expression in the country"" and that the women were now ""prisoners of conscience."" Amnesty believes that the women's conduct ""was politically motivated, and that they were wrongfully prosecuted for what was a legitimate -- if potentially offensive -- protest action,"" it said in a statement. Supporters vent anger on Twitter . John Dalhuisen, director of Amnesty International's Europe and Central Asia Program, urged Russian authorities to overturn the sentence and release the trio unconditionally. He also highlighted recent measures ""restricting the freedom of expression and association"" introduced after a wave of popular protests that accompanied elections earlier this year.  ""This trial is another example of the Kremlin's attempts to discourage and delegitimize dissent. It is likely to backfire,"" he said. Human Rights Watch also said the women should never have been prosecuted for a hate crime. ""The charges and verdict against the Pussy Riot band members distort both the facts and the law,"" Hugh Williamson, the rights group's Europe and Central Asia director, said in a statement. Band member's husband condemns Pussy Riot's prison sentences . Earlier, a number of arrests were made outside the court, where protesters gathered as the verdict was read, RIA Novosti reported. The women are expected to appeal the court's decision. The charge of hooliganism aimed at inciting religious hatred carried a potential sentence of up to seven years in prison. None of the three women is older than 30. They have been in custody since their arrest shortly after the unexpected performance. They looked calm and occasionally smiled and exchanged remarks as they stood, sometimes in handcuffs, behind a glass wall in the court, listening to the lengthy ruling. Moscow district court heard that the three worked together to carry out their ""criminal act which violated public order"" -- in an action that ""went against tradition and is a great insult to the church and people."" The three wore revealing, brightly colored clothing and covered their faces with balaclava-style masks in a style ""inappropriate"" for a church before making use of a microphone and electric guitar, the court was told. Video footage of the ""punk prayer"" protest song was placed online, although the judge said it was not clear who had posted it. Sirovaya said that the apologies by the defendants ""were not sincere"" and described their conduct as ""an unprecedented act of hooliganism by women."" Celebrities back Pussy Riot . Evidence from character witnesses for the three women was also read out. Alyokhina was described as being a writer of poetry, a vegan and a good mother, RIA Novosti said. Pop star Madonna last week performed Pussy Riot-style in a face mask and with the group's name on her back during a packed Moscow gig. She's one of a number of celebrities to back the women's cause. ""Everyone has the right to free speech, everywhere in the world. Maria, Katya, Nadia, I pray for you,"" Madonna said at Tuesday's concert, according to RIA Novosti. ""They did something brave with their action. And I am praying for their freedom."" Rallies in support of Pussy Riot were also organized Friday outside Russian embassies around the world, including in London and Washington. Pussy Riot and Putin's iron fist . Putin criticized the women's action this month but said they should not be judged ""too harshly,"" RIA Novosti said. He added that he hoped the court makes ""the right decision."" Pussy Riot specializes in sudden, often illegal public performances, including one in Moscow's Red Square. The ""punk prayer"" was inspired by the women's anger about the relationship between the Russian government and the Orthodox Church, according to the band's manager, who is married to one of the women. The Orthodox leader Patriarch Kyril has been widely reported as saying Putin's years in power have been a miracle from God. Putin won reelection to the presidency in March in a vote that international observers said did not meet international standards. The presidential election came just months after allegations of fraud in parliamentary elections prompted the largest anti-government demonstrations Russia had seen in two decades.

"Fresh intelligence led the United States to conclude that operatives of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula were in the final stages of planning an attack against U.S. and Western targets, several U.S. officials told CNN. The warning led the U.S. State Department to issue a global travel alert Friday, warning al Qaeda may launch attacks in the Middle East, North Africa and beyond in coming weeks. The U.S. government also was preparing to close 22 embassies and consulates in the region Sunday as a precaution. The chatter among al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula operatives had gone on for weeks but increased in the last few days, the officials said. Taken together with a warning from Yemeni officials, the United States took the extraordinary step of shutting down embassies and issuing travel warnings, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. While the specific target is uncertain, U.S. officials are deeply worried about a possible attack against the U.S. Embassy in Yemen occurring through Tuesday, the officials said. The warnings also come as news has surfaced that al Qaeda's leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, has appointed the head of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, Nasser al-Wahishi, as his overall general manager of the terror network, Seth Jones of the Rand Corporation said. With al-Zawahiri, the man who succeeded Osama bin Laden, and al-Wahishi linked, the United States may be taking a cautious but necessary approach by closing the embassies, Jones said. But as with so much in the intelligence world, there is disagreement over what may really be happening. Officials have told CNN that some analysts believe the threat is solely in Yemen, while others are convinced plots are under way in several countries. Even so, security has been greatly tightened across Yemen as a result of local intelligence that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula was planning attacks in major cities, such as the capital, Sanaa, or Aden, a senior Yemeni national security official told CNN Friday. Yemeni intelligence agencies alerted authorities of the threat two days ago, when the Yemeni president was in Washington, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Britain, France and Germany said their embassies in Sanaa would also be closed on Sunday and Monday over security concerns. The UK Foreign Office warned its citizens Friday against all travel to Yemen, and it strongly urged British nationals to leave now. ""If you don't leave the country now while commercial carriers are still flying it is extremely unlikely that the British government will be able to evacuate you or provide consular assistance,"" according to the Foreign Office warning. The steps showed heightened security concerns about intelligence that indicates a potential attack in Yemen. According to three sources, the United States has information al Qaeda in Yemen was in the final stages of planning for an unspecified attack. ""The threat appears much worse than it has in a long time,"" the Yemeni official said. Yemen has tightened security across the country, deploying security forces at all major government institutions, foreign embassies, foreign residential compounds and international organizations, the official said. According to the Yemeni official, recent U.S. drone attacks may generate reprisals. ""We take these threats seriously, especially since al Qaeda has been dealt many blows over the last few days,"" the official said. In 2011, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula operatives filmed buildings linked to U.S. personnel in Sanaa, according to a source who has seen the video. While the incident is not related to this week's terror warnings, it shows al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's capabilities, CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula operatives filmed video of the building, which is near the U.S. embassy in Sanaa, and the U.S. personnel who were in it, the source told Cruickshank.","Germany, France and Britain also close their Sanaa embassies Sunday and Monday .

"(CNN) -- A killer whale killed a trainer Wednesday afternoon at SeaWorld's Shamu Stadium in Orlando, Florida, a public information officer for the Orange County Sheriff's Office said. The 40-year-old woman, identified by sheriff's spokesman Jim Solomons as Dawn Brancheau, was in the whale holding area about 2 p.m. when ""she apparently slipped or fell into the tank and was fatally injured by one of the whales,"" he said. But a witness told CNN affiliate WKMG-TV that the whale approached the glass side of the 35-foot-deep tank at Shamu Stadium, jumped up and grabbed the trainer by the waist, shaking her so violently that her shoe came off. WKMG: Killer whale kills trainer . A SeaWorld employee who asked not to be identified confirmed the description of the attack and added that the whale involved is named Tillikum. SeaWorld uses ""Shamu"" as a stage name for any of the male or female orcas in its shows. ""One of our most experienced animal trainers drowned"" in the accident, said Dan Brown, vice president and general manager of SeaWorld Orlando. He said an investigation will be carried out. ""We'll make our findings known in due course,"" he said. ""We've never in the history of our parks experienced an incident like this. All standard operating procedures will be reviewed."" He would not elaborate. ""Please bear with us; we've just lost a member of our family,"" he said. The incident occurred after a show called ""Dine with Shamu,"" said Paula Gillespie, who attended with her daughter. ""During the show everything was perfectly fine,"" she said. Afterward, ""we went down to look at his full body underneath the isolation tank,"" she said. ""Everything seemed calm and OK. The trainer was laying down on him and kissing his nose and rubbing him."" But the scene changed quickly, she said. ""Within five minutes, she was down in the tank and we saw all the thrashing and the bubbles and him pushing her with his nose,"" she said. ""It was just so, so traumatic."" Within moments, sirens went off and SeaWorld employees asked her to leave the building, she said. A woman who had watched the whales perform before the incident said the trainers were having difficulties getting the whales to perform. ""They weren't following the instructions,"" Lori Miller said on ""Larry King Live."" ""And the senior trainer actually came out onto the stage to let the crowd know ... that the whales decided they were having more fun splashing each than splashing the crowd."" A patron who did not witness the event said the park refunded her entry fee, although a spokeswoman said the park remained open. Guest David Dalton told CNN affiliate WFTV, ""All of a sudden, out of nowhere, two of the bigger whales just kind of flipped out, going as fast as they could in the water."" Jeffrey Ventre, a former SeaWorld trainer, described Brancheau as ""a great trainer"" and Tillikum as ""a great animal"" who has sired 13 offspring. ""He's huge, he's impressive; people just see him and they go 'Wow!' He's a money stream as well."" Fred Felleman, a marine consultant in Seattle, Washington, said keeping the social animals in what amounts to isolation is bound to cause problems. ""The fact is we don't have the facilities to adequately accommodate not only the physical needs, the psychological and social needs of these animals,"" he told CNN affiliate KIRO-TV. ""We respect lions and wolves and wild dogs as fantastic things, but we don't go run into the Serengeti and try to jump on their back."" iReport: Photo taken moments before Sea World incident . Jack Hanna, director emeritus of the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium in Ohio, said he knew Brancheau and that she would want her work to continue. ""What happened is something that happens; it happens in our line of work,"" he said. ""They are dangerous animals; they're wild animals."" He added that he hopes SeaWorld continues with the work it does with killer whales. But a spokesman for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals called the death ""a tragedy that didn't have to happen."" Jaime Zalac said the organization had called on SeaWorld ""to stop confining oceangoing mammals to an area that to them is like the size of a bathtub, and we have also been asking the park to stop forcing the animals to perform silly tricks over and over again. It's not surprising when these huge, smart animals lash out."" In 2006, a trainer at the adventure park was hospitalized after a killer whale grabbed him and twice held him underwater during a show at Shamu Stadium. In 1999, Tillikum was blamed for the death of a 27-year-old man whose body was found floating on his back in a tank at SeaWorld, the apparent victim of a whale's ""horseplay,"" authorities said then. The Orange County Sheriff's Office said the man apparently hid in the park until after it closed and then climbed into the tank. The 11,000-pound, 22-foot-long whale was ""not accustomed to people being in his tank"" and ""wouldn't have realized he was dealing with a very fragile human being,"" Solomons said at the time. ""He may have been a victim of what a whale would call horseplay, just playing around,"" Solomons said. CNN's John Couwels and Brian Todd contributed to this story.","Victim identified as Dawn Brancheau, 40 .

"A federal judge Wednesday ordered the government to pay more than $17 million to a family that lost four members when a U.S. Marine Corps jet crashed into a California house in 2008. The family of Don Yoon -- who lost his wife, two young daughters, and mother-in-law  -- said it believed it was a ""thoughtful, fair, and reasoned decision"" by the judge, said Brian Panish, lead counsel for the family. Relatives had sought $56 million from the federal government, but in the end were awarded $17.8 million. ""I think the judge was trying to send a message that family is important,"" Panish said of the judgment ordered by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Miller. CNN iReport: Neighbor was first to call 911 . An F/A-18 Hornet headed to nearby Marine Corps Air Station Miramar crashed into the family's house in San Diego on December 8, 2008, after the pilot reported having trouble. The house and another unoccupied one next door were destroyed by the ensuing fire. The pilot, who ejected safely at 400 feet, tried desperately to steer the plane away from danger and screamed in horror when he saw it had crashed into the house, military documents showed. Killed in the crash were Yoon's daughter Rachel, who was almost 2 months old; his 15-month-old daughter Grace; his wife, Young Mi Moon; and her mother, Suk Im Kim, who had recently come to the United States from Korea to help take care of the children. Wednesday's verdict came almost exactly seven years after Yoon married his late wife on Christmas Day 2004, said Panish. Yoon has said he does not blame the pilot and has urged prayers for the pilot not to suffer. Yoon still lives in San Diego, with his sister and brother-in-law, Panish said. He said Yoon has been ""doing the best he can to get through every day, but it's very difficult for him to have such a tragic loss without warning."" In a statement read by Panish, Yoon said, ""Our family is relieved that this part of the process is over, but no sum of money will ever make up for the loss of our loved ones. I still harbor no ill will towards the United States Marine Corps and the pilot that did all he could to prevent this tragedy."" Panish said family members who testified stayed strong and told the story of a loving family and how immeasurable they felt the losses were. He praised the judge for understanding those family relationships. ""The only way to know what someone lost is to know what they had, and he got what they had, and he could measure as best you can the tremendous loss they suffered,"" Panish said. Some of those who testified at the trial spoke Korean and had to use an interpreter, Panish said. He said he hopes the government will abide by the judge's ruling. U.S. Justice Department attorney Bruce Ross told the judge that the family was entitled to ""just and reasonable"" damages, CNN San Diego affiliate KGTV reported. The Marine Corps sacked four top officers of the fighter squadron and disciplined nine other Marines after an investigation showed deferred maintenance and faulty decisions by ground controllers and the pilot contributed to the crash. The investigation found the jet's right engine experienced a string of emergencies that left it relying on the left engine, which had already given mechanics indications of a problem. Though maintenance rules don't require immediate repairs for the problem, the squadron flew the jet 146 times before it eventually crashed because the left engine was starved for fuel. The investigation criticized the pilot for not consulting a pocket checklist that outlined emergency procedures. And while controllers aboard the aircraft carrier that launched the jet urged the pilot to land at a nearby Navy airfield at North Island, squadron officers relied on ""incorrect assumptions and inaccurate data"" to guide him back to the plane's base at Miramar, the investigation found.","Don Yoon lost his wife, two infant daughters and mother-in-law in the crash .

"On Friday, a military jury decided U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales will get life in prison without parole for killing 16 Afghan villagers. Yet victims left behind -- some bearing physical scars, others with emotional ones from seeing their kin indiscriminately, brutally gunned down -- say that, with that sentence, they don't feel they got justice. Friday's decision was not entirely unexpected. In June Bales' pleaded guilty to more than 30 criminal charges, including 16 premeditated murder counts, spared himself from the prospect of a death sentence. He also pleaded guilty to charges related to illicit steroid and alcohol use. But it still remained up to a jury of four officers and two enlisted personnel to decide whether Bales should be eligible for parole. They decided Friday he is not, according to Lt. Col. Gary Dangerfield with Joint Base Lewis-McChord. That means the 39-year-old will spend the rest of his life in a military prison. That's not punishment enough for Haji Wazir. Now 40, Wazir was inside his home in the Panjwai district of Afghanistan's southern Kandahar province in the pre-dawn hours of March 11, 2012, when Bales barged in. What followed was a nightmare, ending with bloodied, limp and in some instances scorched bodies. ""We wanted this murderer to be executed, but we didn't get our wish,"" Wazir said through an interpreter Friday from the Washington state U.S. Army base where the sentence was handed down. The sentence was not just, he added, before appealing to the U.S public to put themselves in his shoes. ""I'm asking the average American right here: If somebody jumps into your house in the middle of the night and kills 11 members of your family and tries to burn them, what punishment would you be passing on that person?"" Wazir and his family weren't the only ones torn on that horrific morning some 18 months ago. Bales slipped away from Camp Belambay, the remote outpost where he was stationed, and into one village, where he began shooting at civilians. After that, he returned to the base, reloaded and went out again to target another village. He left a trail of blood and gore in both villages, with nine children among the dead. Witnesses claimed that the U.S. soldier dragged some bodies of his victims' outside and set them ablaze. The horror ended when Bales returned, once again, to Camp Belambay and turned himself in. In the subsequent hours and days, some spoke highly about Bales, such as attorney Emma Scanlan who described him as a ""devoted husband, father and dedicated member of the armed service."" Yet in Afghanistan and around the world, the massacre quickly spurred outrage. The Taliban vowed to retaliate ""by killing and beheading Americans anywhere in the country."" Afghan President Hamid Karzai suggested, after meeting with villagers who'd seen the carnage and wanted Bales to be tried there to ""heal our broken hearts,"" that the incident had put U.S.-Afghan relations at a breaking point. ""It is by all means the end of the rope here,"" Karzai said then. ""The end of the rope that nobody can afford such luxuries anymore."" Bales was identified as the culprit days later and eventually put in solitary confinement at the U.S. military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. The military announced last December that Bales faced a court-martial. The Army soldier spoke at this week's sentencing, calling what he'd done ""an act of cowardice."" ""I hid behind a mask of Bravado,"" Bales said, according to a tweet from court from Drew Mikkelsen of CNN Seattle affiliate KING. Also admitting he'd taken steroids and drank sporadically, the soldier apologized to his victims. ""I am responsible,"" he said. Because of him, some in Afghanistan are still suffering the consequences. Haji Mohammad Naim saw Bales come into his southwest Afghanistan home around 2 a.m. and kill women there, as well as some of his children. Bullets struck him in the neck and the face. That incident and others in which U.S. soldiers have killed civilians -- including another of Naim's sons, in a separate incident, he says -- have disgraced American forces in the eyes of many Afghans. Children in his village used to run toward U.S. troops, Naim said; now, they ""run away and try to hide."" If America is to improve its image, there must be accountability, he said.

"Rocker Joan Jett warned SeaWorld to stop blasting her music at ""sound-sensitive"" orcas or they'll see her protesting at their gate. ""I was surprised and upset to see on YouTube that SeaWorld used ""I Love Rock 'n' Roll"" as the opening music for its cruel and abusive 'Shamu Rocks' show,"" Jett said in a letter sent this week to SeaWorld President Jim Atchison. Jett's demand comes as several major artists canceled planned performances at the Orlando, Florida, theme park in response to petition drives by fans who became upset after watching the CNN documentary ""Blackfish."" ""I'm among the millions who saw 'Blackfish' and am sickened that my music was blasted without my permission at sound-sensitive marine mammals,"" Jett wrote.  ""These intelligent and feeling creatures communicate by sonar and are driven crazy in the tiny tanks in which they are confined."" The documentary -- which first aired on CNN in October -- tells the story of the killing in 2010 of experienced SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau by a 12,000-pound orca.  The film raises questions about the safety and humaneness of keeping killer whales in captivity over the past 39 years. ""SeaWorld's reliance on cruelty and captivity for commerce has been widely exposed,"" Jett's letter, obtained by CNN, said.  ""I hope you'll take the respectable path and release the captive orcas to coastal sanctuaries so that they can live out their lives with other orcas in nature.  This move would show that your company is truly family-friendly."" Jett warned Atchison that if she doesn't get it in writing that SeaWorld has stopped using any of her music, ""I will be forced to take further action, and you'll find me among the PETA protesters outside your parks."" A SeaWorld spokesman said that Jett's song is no longer used in any of its shows, but that it ""was played as walk-in music for the ""Shamu Rocks"" nighttime show at SeaWorld Orlando and was fully licensed for us to use."" ""A new nighttime Shamu show is being designed for SeaWorld Orlando and we had no plans to use any of her music in that show,"" spokesman Nick Gollattscheck told CNN Wednesday. Rock band Cheap Trick is the latest act to cancel a show during SeaWorld's six weekends of Bands, Brew & BBQ events starting in February.   The group follows in the footsteps of Heart, Willie Nelson and Barenaked Ladies, who announced withdrawals from the park's schedule this month. ""We expect that other artists will be targeted in this campaign,"" the SeaWorld spokesman said. The park's concert schedule -- which also previously listed REO Speedwagon, Martina McBride, 38 Special, Justin Moore and Scotty McCreery -- has disappeared from SeaWorld's website.  It now simply promises ""incredible concerts with top artists in classic rock and country music."" SeaWorld is working to book replacement acts, Gollattscheck said.  ""We'll announce the full lineup of bands when all artists have been confirmed. We'll repost the schedule on our site then."" Artists speak up . ""I don't agree with the way they treat their animals,"" Nelson told CNN about his decision to cancel. ""It wasn't that hard a deal for me."" The Canadian rock band Barenaked Ladies was the first, reacting to a petition posted on Change.org. ""This is a complicated issue, and we don't claim to understand all of it, but we don't feel comfortable proceeding with the gig at this time,"" the band said on its Facebook page. Sisters Nancy and Ann Wilson of Heart did not elaborate last week when they announced their decision to cancel at SeaWorld, although they acknowledged it was ""due to the controversial documentary film."" ""While we're disappointed a small group of misinformed individuals was able to deny fans what would have been great concerts at SeaWorld by Heart, Barenaked Ladies and Willie Nelson, we respect the bands' decisions,"" SeaWorld's Gollattscheck told CNN on Sunday.  He has not yet responded to news that Cheap Trick joined the exodus. SeaWorld said it would like the musical artists to learn for themselves about SeaWorld. ""The bands and artists have a standing invitation to visit any of our parks to see firsthand or to speak to any of our animal experts to learn for themselves how we care for animals and how little truth there is to the allegations made by animal extremist groups opposed to the zoological display of marine mammals,"" Gollattscheck said.

"Dogged by allegations of sexual harassment, San Diego Mayor Bob Filner admitted Thursday ""that I need help"" but stopped short of resigning. ""I'm clearly doing something wrong,"" he said. Some of his longtime backers are urging Filner to step down. Among them is former city councilwoman Donna Frye -- a Democrat, like Filner, who recently worked in the mayor's office. She said Thursday that after hearing allegations directly from several women, ""I could not not act."" She sent Filner a letter Tuesday asking him to step down. Filner acknowledged Frye's request in a statement Thursday and implicitly admitted there was merit to her concerns. ""I am embarrassed to admit that I have failed to fully respect the women who work for me and with me, and that at times I have intimidated them,"" he said. ""It's a good thing that behavior that would have been tolerated in the past is being called out in this generation for what it is: inappropriate and wrong."" No women have come forward publicly to detail allegations against Filner. He has not been charged with any crime, nor has anyone filed a lawsuit against him. Shamed politicians look for redemption . Yet Marco Gonzalez, a Southern California lawyer, told reporters Thursday he and Frye know of ""very specific acts from individuals who have worked for the mayor that they have been subjected to behavior that does not meet our community standards."" It's up to them to provide specifics, Gonzalez said, but even absent such public declarations, he and others felt compelled to speak out for them. ""I believe what they have told me, and they are not alone,"" Frye said. Amid the uproar, the mayor announced Thursday that he's ""begun to work with professionals to make changes in my behavior and approach"" and that he and his staff will have sexual harassment training. Filner also promised that he'd personally reach out and apologize to those who now or have in the past worked in his office. ""Please know that I fully understand that only I am the one that can make these changes,"" he said. Filner did not indicate he had any plans to resign. Politics is full of second chances . Earlier this week, numerous reports -- including one from CNN affiliate KSWB -- said that Filner's fiancee, Bronwyn Ingram, had called off their engagement for unspecified reasons. The Republican Party of San Diego cheered Ingram's move on its Facebook page, saying ""she deserves better."" Since then, they have kept up their criticism of Filner and Democrats who, they allege, overlooked Filner's behavior that they claim ""has been widely known ... for years."" In her remarks Thursday, Frye said she understood that ""there will be many opportunities to turn this into a political side show or worse."" The mayor himself can help address the crisis, and help San Diego, by stepping down, she said. ""I am asking our mayor and his closest advisers to please take this to heart,"" the councilwoman said.

"I can't help but feel humbled and grateful when I hear the stories of women who marched for women's rights in the 1970s and the suffragists who fought for the right to vote. What they accomplished deserves more than a nod and lip service. We must honor them by making our generation's mark on the concerns facing women today. Unfortunately, that still includes goals we've fought too long for, like reproductive rights. Today is International Women's Day and March is Women's History Month. As we celebrate all that women have accomplished in the struggle for gender equality, we are also redefining what counts as a ""women's issue."" Gender-related violence . Worldwide, about one in three women is victim of gender-related violence. From military sexual assault, to domestic violence, to rape on college campuses, we must do more to prevent violence against women. Many people think of sex trafficking as a ""women's issue,"" but labor trafficking also has impact on women. Some of the industries in which labor trafficking is common, including domestic work, are dominated by women. And in industries like agricultural work, women are singled out for sexual abuse or exploitation. I've represented victims of human trafficking in Los Angeles, which is a major trafficking destination because of its port, international airport, and proximity to Asia and Mexico. Financially desperate adults are lured to Los Angeles by traffickers, only to be forced to work as laborers in Southern California's agricultural sector. Runaway youth come to Los Angeles to find stardom or a warm place to sleep on the street, but many will be exploited through pornography, a thriving industry in the San Fernando Valley. We have a responsibility to improve our current labor trafficking laws. Education . Republican Sen. Rand Paul said recently, look at how well women are doing at colleges across the country. What he failed to consider is that women are graduating not only with a degree, but with staggering level of student debt. Instead of telling women that they're doing just fine, we need legislators who are going to fight for students so they can attain the degrees they want and enter chosen professions without an insurmountable amount of debt. Senator Paul also forgot to mention that some of the best-paying jobs, jobs in science, technology, engineering and math fields (STEM), are still overwhelming dominated by men. Only 3% of tech startups are formed by women. We have a thriving tech industry, but men hold far more computer and mathematical occupations than women. Why aren't more women getting tech jobs? We need programs that promote STEM education for those who have historically been left out of these high-paying jobs. Economic equality . We often talk about the impact of pay discrimination on women's pocketbooks because it costs women on average more than $10,000 annually and jeopardizes their retirement security. But we forget that many poverty issues also impact women.  Raising the minimum wage is actually a ""women's issue"" because 64% of minimum wage workers are women. Women are increasingly becoming the sole or primary earners in their household, so economic issues that hold women back have huge impact on our entire economy. Let's help women financially support their families as we create more good-paying jobs in our communities. Many women not only face pay discrimination in the workplace, but struggle at home as well, trying to provide care for their family on top of their job. Women are still mostly the caretakers for their families, so they are disproportionately affected by the lack of guaranteed sick days and the lack of paid family leave. It is hard to overstate how far behind America is compared to our global competitors when it comes to these basic policies that protect families. When we talk about women's issues, we must look comprehensively at the challenges all women face to ensure our policies reflect the support women truly need, because these concerns impact not only women, but their families and communities. Our generation is ready to do that.","Sandra Fluke: I feel humbled and grateful for women who fought for our rights .

"When Mr He, a 39-year-old furniture factory owner came down with flu symptoms late last year, he wasn't worried. According to his family,  the man, who worked in Guangdong province in southern China, had always been healthy. Weeks later, He was on a ventilator. Hospitalized for about 20 days, he slipped into a vegetative state and later died, his family said. He was diagnosed as having H7N9 virus, a new strain of avian flu that jumped from birds to humans for the first time last year, said his close cousin, who requested not to be identified. ""I couldn't believe it,"" she said. ""How could this happen to him? It all came so suddenly to a healthy person."" In recent weeks, China has seen a spike in cases and experts are worried that infections will gather pace as the country celebrates the Lunar New Year this week - a peak time for travel and for poultry sales. Fresh wave? Since the strain was first reported in Shanghai in February 2013, it has affected 246 in mainland China, according to Hong Kong's Department of Health. The World Health Organization says that 56 have died from the disease. The number of cases faded after May, but returned in late 2013. Like all flu strains, H7N9 cases increase during colder months. In January alone, 19 deaths and 96 human cases have been reported, according to figures from the Chinese Center for Disease Control cited by state news agency Xinhua on Monday -- rivaling the initial wave of H7N9 cases seen in March 2013. Cases have also been reported in Taiwan and in Hong Kong, which on Tuesday began culling 20,000 chickens after a sample of live chicken imported from mainland China tested positive for H7 viruses. According to the WHO, most of the human cases were exposed to the H7N9 virus through contact with poultry or contaminated environments, such as live bird markets, . ""When the chickens are very overcrowded, at the time of festivals like Christmas, Chinese New Year, and there are no bio-security measures taken, then the virus spreads through poultry very quickly,"" said Dr. Kwok-Yung Yuen, chair of infectious diseases at the University of Hong Kong. ""It's also possible that travelers will bring live poultry back to their own villages,"" he added. The WHO does not plan to issue a special advisory ahead of the holiday, said Gregory Hartl, a spokesman with the organization. ""Further sporadic human cases are expected in affected and possibly neighboring areas, especially given expected increases in production, trade and transport of poultry associated with the upcoming Lunar New Year,"" the WHO warned. The Lunar New Year is one of the biggest annual human migrations on the planet as most Chinese travel to spend the nearly two-week holiday with their families. 'Stringent measures needed' The H7N9 virus appears deadlier than the seasonal flu, but less virulent than another bird flu strain, H5N1, with a crude 30% mortality rate, said Yuen, who has worked on major outbreaks including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and H5N1. He said the key is to implement sanitation measures at the live poultry markets. He drew parallels of the current situation in China with the first case of H5N1, which appeared in Hong Kong in 1997. The Hong Kong government implemented rules such as requiring regular cleaning of transport cages, mandating a rest day when no live poultry would be allowed at the marketplace and ordering all unsold birds at the market to be killed in the evening. Yuen said such measures are crucial to avoid the spread of the virus. ""There will be an increasing number of cases in the coming February to May unless the mainland government takes more stringent measures to stop this spread,"" Yuen said. Live poultry trading has been halted in three cities in the hardest-hit province of Zhejiang in eastern China, Xinhua reported. And in Shanghai, the live poultry trade will shut starting January 31 to April 30 to prevent spread of bird flu, according to Xinhua. However, not all H7N9 patients have had close contact with live birds, including the case of He, whose cousin said his closest poultry contact was eating chicken at a restaurant. On January 19, a 31-year-old  Shanghai doctor died, marking the first medical worker death from the strain.  The doctor, according to Xinhua, appeared to have limited exposure to poultry or a contaminated environment, . Infection of health care workers is closely watched because it might indicate human-to-human transmission in a medical setting. ""Sometimes we just don't know the source,"" said the WHO's Hartl. Not having exposure to poultry doesn't equate human-to-human transmission, he added. H7N9 does not appear to transmit easily among humans, according to the WHO. Loved ones suffer . Family members who've seen their loved ones suffer from H7N9 describe a long, harrowing illness, that resembled pneumonia. Zhang Kewei's 57-year-old father, who lived in eastern province of Zhejiang, was diagnosed as having H7N9 after developing a 104 degree Fahrenheit fever in November. He did not survive. ""He, at first, felt cold and had a fever and later, his oxygen level in his blood dropped to 40 per cent,"" said his daughter Zhang Kewei. His family struggled to transfer him to a bigger hospital. When they did, it took several days to confirm that he had H7N9, she said. ""We couldn't stop crying,"" said Zhang. ""But we had to wipe away tears, and told my dad that he was ill, but assured him that he would recover, but needed to suffer a little because the needles could hurt."" ""My father then said: 'It's OK. I'm not afraid.'""","H7N9 bird flu cases spike in China ahead of Lunar New Year .

"Former President George W. Bush has a new mission: helping those with the least in Africa. He has stayed largely out of the limelight since his second term as U.S. president ended in 2008. But on another continent, thousands of miles from the politics and infighting of Washington, Bush is quietly burnishing a humanitarian legacy that may in some people's eyes outweigh the controversies sparked by his time in office. Opinion: George W. Bush's legacy is on the mend . He and his wife, Laura, are in Africa this week, where they helped renovate a cancer screening clinic in Zambia. The clinic, which is designed help women fight cervical cancer, builds on the former president's work fighting HIV/AIDS on the continent. While he was in office, Bush set up a plan -- the President's Emergency Program for AIDS Relief -- that made a massive investment in antiretroviral drugs and dramatically reduced the number of AIDS deaths in Africa. ""I'm really proud of the American people for their generosity,"" he told CNN in an exclusive interview. ""I wish Americans knew how many lives were saved. Someday, they will."" CNN exclusive: George W. Bush on AIDS, Mandela, Snowden . Bush got his own hands dirty working on the refurbishment of the clinic -- a sign, he said, of his commitment to the cause. ""I'm here to serve and I believe strongly that with power and wealth comes a duty to serve the least,"" he said. ""Our purpose is to elevate the need for screening for cervical cancer throughout the continent of Africa."" The renovated clinic opened Monday as a cervical cancer screening and treatment center, and the Bushes hope it will help save the lives of thousands of women. ""It breaks your heart to realize that such hope was given to communities throughout the continent of Africa because of antiretrovirals and then women are dying of cervical cancer -- so there's hope and then there's despondency,"" George Bush said. ""We wanted to help make sure that despondency didn't settle in."" Bush at his best . Bush's harshest critics might be surprised by this side of the former president. His shirt splattered with paint from the project, he appeared genuinely happy about doing manual labor. He was joking, jovial and genuinely happy to be there. Bush was relaxed as he spoke with CNN, saying that after an extended period out of the limelight he feels like a tortoise sticking its head out of its shell. The former president is aware that his legacy will be tied to the Iraq War, but he wants people to know what he is doing in Africa, too. 'History will judge' In his comments, Bush also touched on the subject of Nelson Mandela, who is on life support in a South African hospital. ""Sometimes, there are leaders who come and go. His legacy will last for a long time,"" he said of the ailing anti-apartheid icon. Mandela had criticized him publicly about the war in Iraq, Bush said he doesn't bear a grudge. ""He wasn't the only guy,"" he said. ""It's OK. I made decisions that were the right decisions. History will ultimately judge. I never held someone's opinion against him; I didn't look at him differently because he didn't agree with me on an issue."" Bush also initially said he wasn't bothered about his ratings in opinion polls, even if some of them now put him at a similar level to Obama. ""The only time I really cared was on Election Day,"" he said. Then, drawing laughter from his wife, he checked himself and said, ""You know, I guess it's nice. I mean, let me rephrase that: Thank you for bringing it up."" In any case, the former president said he doesn't expect a fair assessment of his legacy in his lifetime. ""I won't be around, because it will take a while for the objective historians to show up,"" he said. ""So I'm pretty comfortable with it. I did what I did; I know the spirit in which I did it.""","Former President George W. Bush is in Zambia with his wife, Laura .

"Charges are expected in the death of a New York City college student who was injured during a fraternity ritual on a trip to Pennsylvania, a prosecutor said Thursday. Monroe County District Attorney E. David Christine told CNN that criminal charges were likely in connection with the death of Baruch College freshman Chun ""Michael"" Deng, 19, who died Monday during a fraternity weekend trip to the Poconos. The level of charges and who specifically will be charged is not clear, Christine said. The Pi Delta Psi fraternity was conducting a ritual outdoors for new pledges called the ""glass ceiling,"" according to a probable cause affidavit obtained by CNN. The objective was for Deng, who was blindfolded and wearing a backpack filled with a 20-pound bag of sand, to navigate toward someone who was calling for him ""while other fraternity brothers physically prevent that from happening,"" witnesses said, according to the affidavit. Deng fell backward, struck his head and was unconscious and unresponsive immediately after he fell, the document states. Other members of the fraternity told authorities they saw Deng get pushed but did not see who did it because it was dark in the yard of the residence where the ritual took place, the affidavit said. Deng was then carried inside and placed by a fire because his body was cold and wet from the conditions outside. Deng remained unconscious while members of the fraternity researched his symptoms online and found the closest hospital, according to the affidavit. ""A minimum of at least two hours went by before he actually received any type of medical care,"" said Pocono Mountain Regional Police Chief Harry Lewis. Three fraternity members drove Deng to a Pennsylvania hospital early Sunday morning, authorities said. ""The transport was done in a private vehicle ... which means this poor victim wasn't receiving any medical attention until the time he actually made it to the hospital,"" Christine said. He was unresponsive and in critical condition upon his arrival at the hospital. Physicians determined Deng had suffered major brain trauma, and he was put on life support, according to the district attorney's office. The affidavit states that physicians discovered a set of fresh scratches and some bruising on Deng's knees. His skull was not fractured, and he had little swelling to the back of his head. Doctors also noted that the toxicology and alcohol  tests were negative. Physicians later determined Deng was brain dead and required a breathing machine to be kept alive. Authorities said more than 30 members of fraternity Pi Delta Psi had traveled to a residence in the Pocono Mountains, roughly 90 miles away from New York City, for the weekend. Some fraternity members left the residence before police arrived, Lewis said. Police are ""looking for them and hoping they will come forward with any information."" In a statement Monday, Pi Delta Psi Fraternity Inc. said it has ""revoked and terminated all affiliation with the Baruch Colony, effective immediately."" ""Baruch Colony has violated the values and rules of our organization,"" the statement said. ""We will also revoke the individual membership of any member found involved in this incident."" Opinion: Bullying among boys easily dismissed? In a statement, Baruch College said Wednesday that Deng died while participating in an unsanctioned fraternity pledging event. Baruch College has a ""zero tolerance policy regarding hazing,"" according to the statement. Deng's death is a ""deeply painful reminder that no individual should ever be put into a position where his or her personal safety is in jeopardy,"" the statement said. Along with its own internal review, Baruch is cooperating with law enforcement, the statement said.","Pi Delta Psi ""revokes"" affiliation with Baruch College chapter after student death .

"(CNN)The U.S. is turning to a familiar -- but some would say unexpected -- name to lead its team at the next Ryder Cup: Davis Love III. Yes, even though Love was the losing captain as Europe rallied in 2012 in the Miracle at Medinah in Illinois, the 50-year-old will succeed Tom Watson at the 2016 edition at Hazeltine in Minnesota. He'll go up against Darren Clarke, who last week got the nod for Europe. Love was unveiled Tuesday, about five months after the PGA of America set up a Ryder Cup task force in the wake of another loss to Europe in golf's most prestigious team event. Love himself was part of the 11-person committee, joining the likes of Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson and past captains Tom Lehman and Raymond Floyd. Love named Lehman as a vice-captain. ""I am here with the same goal as in 2012 but not as the same captain,"" Love told reporters. ""It is a great honor to be in the position to help build the team, but our mission doesn't end there. What we accomplish in 2016 at Hazeltine must serve as the foundation for future USA Ryder Cup teams,"" Love said separately in a statement. The 2012 Ryder Cup will no doubt serve as motivation. With the U.S. seemingly coasting to victory -- holding a 10-6 lead entering the final day -- Europe won eight of the last 12 matches to eke out a 14 1/2-13 1/2 win. And when the U.S. was unable to overturn its skid last year at Gleneagles in Scotland, it meant a sixth defeat in the last seven Ryder Cups. Given the record it's not surprising that criticism followed, but no one quite expected Mickelson to lay into Watson -- who was yards away -- at a post series press conference. Mickelson attended Tuesday's press conference with Love. Woods skipped the 2014 Ryder Cup as he recovered from a back injury and who knows if the slumping 14-time major champion will return next year. He's currently taking a break from golf. He, though, gave his backing to Love. ""I want to congratulate Davis on his selection,"" Woods said in a statement. ""I have great respect for him as a person, player and captain. I know he'll do an outstanding job leading the 2016 U.S. team. ""I'm proud of what the task force accomplished, making substantive changes in the Captain's selection process and qualifying system."" As a player, Love played in six Ryder Cups and compiled a singles record of three wins and a loss, halving two matches.","Davis Love III to captain the U.S. at the 2016 Ryder Cup .

"A new Pew Research Center study shows that millennial women are entering the workplace at near wage parity, with the narrowest pay gap on record. Millennial women like me are more likely to have graduated from college than their male counterparts. We have role models like Marissa Mayer and new General Motors CEO Mary Barra. Today, there's a much more open conversation about sexism and how it manifests than there was 10 years ago. And it's no coincidence that a recent poll from Ms. magazine found that 73% of women voters under 30 identify as feminist. It would seem today's young women are set for the post-feminist professional paradise dreamed up by our foremothers. But until women are paid the same as men, we will never be truly equal. In a capitalist society, money is the key indicator of worth. The wage gap has functioned across history to make women dependent on men as providers. We can't save as much for retirement, stash away cash to treat ourselves or even take care of our families in the way we want if we're starting at a deficit. This is an issue of financial security for a generation already facing much more instability than our parents or grandparents. READ: Millennial women are closing pay gap, but pessimistic about workplace equality . The Pew study found that an astounding 75% of millennial women believe more changes are needed to combat gender inequality in the workplace. It makes sense, then, that these are the same young activists who have been working valiantly for the passage of the Paycheck Fairness Act and who see working-class heroine Lilly Ledbetter as a more imitable role model than Sheryl Sandberg. Millennial women can get involved by letting their representatives know they want legislation that addresses wage parity for men and women. Additionally, one of the most powerful things young women can do for their own negotiations is to organize with their peers before and after taking a job, so they can know compare notes and know if they are being underpaid. Information makes a difference in knowing what to ask for. The best news to come out of this study is that we strongly and rightly acknowledge that the old boy's club is still in place. Young women are far more likely than men their age to cite the continued existence of the wage gap and the reality -- supported by a glance at a recent study on the stagnant role of women on corporate boards -- that men have it easier when it comes to getting the top job. They are just as likely as older women to say that society is set still set up to serve men. That's notable and promising, since many women my age have been fed the myth that the feminist movement achieved its goals and sexism no longer exists. But I worry that we, as young women, while understanding sexism to be a systemic problem, still think of it as something we have to fix individually -- and therefore, we don't want to see ourselves as victims of it. In the Pew study, I was surprised to see that while women are highly aware of gender discrimination and the different forms it takes, very few reported experiencing it themselves. READ: The generation we love to dump on . It's much less scary to imagine sexism as something that happens to other women. Once you're forced to admit that you've experienced it, you have to either accept it or do something about it. Feminism is hearing your pain and your struggle in another woman's voice and suddenly realizing there's nothing wrong with you and nothing wrong with her, but something wrong with the world trying to make you think there is. It's easy to focus the conversation on specific examples of highly privileged women who've made it to the upper echelons of power. But feminism isn't about making it possible for a few women to get power. Instead, it's about changing the system from the ground up so that all women have that opportunity. In order to do that, women have to be on an equal playing field in terms of pay from the moment they accept their first job. Some may take from this new study that millennial women, despite the narrowing wage gap, have a bleak view of their future. As a member of that group, I'd argue that we have a realistic view. It's that understanding -- that the fight is not over and there is still much more work to be done -- that might make us the generation that crafts workplaces and a world where sexism is truly a thing of the past.","New Pew Research study shows millennial women face narrowest pay gap on record .

"You can't escape the headlines. An Australian going to college in the United States is gunned down by teens who police say killed him out of boredom. A few days later, a World War II veteran is beaten to death for reasons still unknown. The death of Australian Christopher Lane in Duncan, Oklahoma, even sparked calls for Aussies to boycott travel to the United States because of all the violence. Two shocking, high-profile crimes, one question:  ""What the hell is going on!?"" Facebook user Stacey James Gordon wrote on CNN's Facebook page. ""This country better wake up ...our youth have serious issues,"" Heather Chesser wrote. Although the cases have struck a nerve with their disturbing randomness and apparent cruelty, the reality is that living in the United States may never have been safer, and you're much more likely to be the victim of a crime committed by someone you know than you are to be assaulted by a stranger. Nearly eight of every 10 murders in the United States between 1993 and 2008 were committed by someone the victim knew, according a 2010 report by the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics. The report didn't include figures for 2011 or 2012. Similarly, nearly two out of every three nonviolent crimes were committed by someone the victim knew. Pair that with figures on overall crime: According to the FBI, the violent crime rate in the United States is about half what it was in 1992. And between 1992 and 2011, the annual number of murders in the United States fell from 23,760 to 14,612 despite a growing population. Rape, robbery, assault, even property crimes also fell in a well-documented decline that has gone on for years, albeit with a small upturn in 2012. Criminologists have cited shifts in the crack cocaine market, which drove many 1990s-era murders; an increase in the number of offenders behind bars; the country's aging population; and more sophisticated policing for the declines. But perceptions of crime haven't always followed the reality. In May, a Pew Research Center study found that 56% of Americans believe that gun violence is higher than it was 20 year ago, even though it has fallen precipitously since the 1990s. And in 2011, Gallup found that 68% of Americans believed crime was getting worse, despite the reality of declining crime rates nationwide.","Crime rates have been declining for years .

"When Derrick Bell was a young lawyer in the Department of Justice's new Civil Rights Division in the late 1950s, his supervisor told him to drop his membership in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Bell refused, and soon saw his caseload reduced and desk moved into the hallway. Eventually he resigned. It would not be the last time Bell gave up a prized position for a principle. Years later, he left Harvard Law School -- where he had been the first tenured African-American professor -- over the lack of any black women on the faculty. Bell was a legal scholar who broke racial barriers in a career that influenced students, including a young Barack Obama at Harvard. He died last October. Now Bell is in the news, due to a video clip made public by the website of the late conservative activist Andrew Breitbart, who died March 1 at age 43. Breitbart had promised to release videos of Obama as a student at Harvard Law School that he said would show people ""why racial division and class warfare are central to what 'hope and change' was sold in 2008."" The clip made public on Breitbart's website this week shows Obama introducing Bell at a Harvard demonstration in 1991. Obama encourages the crowd to ""open up your hearts and your minds to the words of Professor Derrick Bell"" and then embraces him. To Breitbart and those at his website, the clip proves a connection between Obama and a radical academic with an anti-white message. They seek to link Bell to the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Obama's former preacher in Chicago who became an issue during the 2008 presidential campaign because of anti-white pronouncements. Joel Pollak, the editor-in-chief of Breitbart.com, called Bell ""the Jeremiah Wright of academia"" in an interview Thursday on CNN. He argues that Obama's association with Bell and Wright shows his leaning toward radical social views, and that such issues need to be fully vetted in an election year. ""It carries over into his governance because his Justice Department won't treat black civil rights violators the same way it treats white civil rights violators,"" Pollak said, adding ""there's a racial pattern in which justice is enforced and it gives us a sense of how Barack Obama thinks about these issues."" However, many who knew Bell through his legal and teaching career express admiration for his life's achievements and his academic prowess. ""Bell's pursuit of racial and social justice and his dogged critique of liberal incrementalism in universities and elsewhere was like a persistent wind that changed the landscape of law schools and influenced the larger academic world as well,"" wrote Harvard law professor Lani Guinier and Texas School of Law professor Gerald Torres in a remembrance of Bell published in the ""Chronicle of Higher Education."" ""He worked in so many ways: a mentor to many of today's leading academics, a master teacher whose commitment to his law students was unquestioned and unmatched, and a provocative scholar and critic,"" Guinier and Torres continued. ""He was a celebrated maverick before that word lost its luster."" Guinier had particular reason to honor Bell. In 1998, she became the first black women granted tenure as a Harvard Law School professor, six years after Bell's departure over that issue. Bell was a founder of critical race theory, which examined the intersection of race, power and law in a harsh portrayal of American society as one dominated by class and racial conflict. His book ""Race, Racism, and American Law"" is taught in civil rights courses today, and those in the legal world offer a more comprehensive description of critical race theory than Pollak's assertion that it ""is all about white supremacy."" In their remembrance, Guinier and Torres wrote that critical race theory ""challenged liberalism for failing to go far enough in opposing the entrenched interests that historically benefited from the racial caste system that was being dismantled."" According to Guinier and Torres, the theory contends that racial liberalism in the 1950s and '60s relied solely on litigation as a strategy and focused on ""top-down social reform"" that emphasized interracial contact to promote tolerance. ""As Bell recognized, that strategy left poor whites haunted by the sense that they had been betrayed by the elites; at the same time, it enabled them to blame blacks as the beneficiaries of that betrayal,"" Guinier and Torres wrote. ""Bell led scholars in many disciplines to see how the interests of middle- and upper-class whites drove social change. Thus, litigation alone would not produce significantly new and inventive policy solutions."" Bell challenged the foundations of what he saw as racial injustice with little regard for political leanings or labels. For example, the New York Times obituary on Bell noted that he once wrote that the violence from school desegregation in the United States after the Supreme Court's landmark 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education made him wonder if an order for equal schools for both races would have been a better outcome. Guinier and Torres cited what they called Bell's ""groundbreaking analysis"" of what he labeled the interest convergence dilemma. ""The interest of blacks in achieving racial equality will be accommodated only when it converges with the interests of whites,"" they quoted from Bell's writing. Bell's teaching included the use of narrative structure and storytelling to illuminate and challenge thinking on race, class and gender. One of his stories, ""Space Traders,"" is a biting political and social satire that HBO made into a TV movie starring Robert Guillaume. It's about an alien offer to solve America's economic and energy problems in exchange for removing the nation's dark-skinned population. ""Derrick chose to speak and write in parables,"" said John Sexton, a student of Bell's who became president of New York University, in a eulogy at a memorial service in November. ""He created his own way of teaching about race through allegorical conversations stripped of pretense and euphemism. He examined complex dynamics of behavior through the simple need to hear and tell stories, among the most ancient of human tools."" Bell also came under criticism in his career. U.S. Appellate Court Judge Richard Posner, a conservative, wrote in the New Republic magazine in 1997 that critical race theory ""turns its back on the Western tradition of rational inquiry, forswearing analysis for narrative."" ""Rather than marshal logical arguments and empirical data, critical race theorists tell stories -- fictional, science-fictional, quasi-fictional, autobiographical, anecdotal -- designed to expose the pervasive and debilitating racism of America today,"" Posner wrote. ""By repudiating reasoned argumentation, the storytellers reinforce stereotypes about the intellectual capacities of non-whites."" Sexton, who hired his former professor at NYU, said Bell was ""a seeker and lover of truth, a radical in the sense that he chose to live ethically in a deeply flawed society"" and ""a scholar who spoke and wrote the truth of his own profound and deeply scarred experience of injustice with honesty and eloquence."" ""He wrote and spoke with powerful authenticity about race in ways that alienated not only many an adversary but also many a friend, some who even begged for his silence,"" Sexton said. ""But he knew that the cost of silence to his soul could exceed the sacrifice of good opinion and material goods to himself."" To Sexton, Bell ""knew that he was meant to strive, to struggle, and to push -- there would be no short cuts."" ""Yes, Derrick rocked the boat,"" he continued. ""He also shook the tree, yielding fruits of exceptional scholarship that nourished the discipline of law and thousands of colleagues, students and friends, whom he inspired to teach each other the law and to stand up, speak out, and find joy and satisfaction in stretching the boundaries of justice."" In particular, Sexton said, Bell ""placed his courageous and ardent protests within a crucible of reverence for every human being."" Guinier and Torres wrote in their remembrance that Bell's ideas and life experiences were inseparable. They quoted him from an NPR interview in which he described being a civil rights lawyer in the 1960s, flying from town to town to get information on discrimination and then returning to New York to file complaints and litigate the cases. ""And I thought that my place in heaven was assured,"" Bell told NPR. Only later did he realize nothing would change if local people failed to organize, telling NPR: ""I am much more humble with regard to my role today than I was as a young civil-rights lawyer.""","Derrick Bell is in the news because of a video on a conservative website .

"On Tuesday morning, Edward Snowden materialized on a telepresence robot, beaming in to an auditorium in Canada from an undisclosed location in Russia. The former National Security Agency contractor assailed agency surveillance programs in an interview with Chris Anderson, curator of the TED2014 conference, and then, via robot, roamed the corridors of the Vancouver Convention Centre, randomly encountering people (including Google co-founder Sergey Brin) attending the conference. On Thursday morning, NSA deputy director Richard Ledgett also appeared by video feed at the conference to counter Snowden's remarks, but the video connection was so poor that the session had to be interrupted, to be resumed more than an hour later. Ledgett ultimately told the conference that Snowden had put lives at risk by disclosing the agency's methods to America's enemies and showed ""amazing arrogance"" in defying the judgment of the three branches of the U.S. government, which he said had blessed the surveillance programs. Snowden had argued that surveillance invaded privacy without benefit and that technology companies must encrypt private data (Google announced Thursday that it was increasing the security of Gmail in response to the NSA revelations). People deserve a right to privacy from government oversight when they order a book online, call their families or take a trip, Snowden said. The contrast, in message and in the power and limits of technology, captured one of the central dynamics of this year's TED conference: the remarkable things people can accomplish with 21st century machines and the very real and often unresolved questions that result. The 30th anniversary gathering for the organization built around the subjects of its acronym -- technology, entertainment and design -- has been to a large extent focused on the ""T"" part. Inventor Ray Kurzweil looked two decades ahead to a time when, he argued, people will use nanobots to connect the capillaries of their brains to the cloud, merging biological thinking with artificial intelligence and enabling a leap in human capabilities equivalent to the great advances of millions of years of evolution. MIT Media Lab co-founder Nicholas Negroponte predicted people will learn languages, and the plays of Shakespeare, by ingesting a pill. NFL punter Chris Kluwe, wearing Google Glass on stage, forecast the rise of virtual reality and augmented reality in pro sports, enabling fans to literally feel the action on the field. Science writer David Epstein showed how technological advances, including synthetic running tracks and high-tech uniforms, help enable today's athletes to zoom past the records of history's great sports figures. Giving evidence of the power of technology, Hugh Herr, the head of the Biomechatronics research group at the Media Lab, walked confidently on bionic legs around the stage as he gave his TED Talk Wednesday. Herr's legs were amputated after he suffered frostbite from a mountain climbing expedition. He noted that he can make his height adjustable, from as little as 5 feet, to as tall as he'd like, depending on the occasion. And Herr predicted that bionics will eventually be an everyday tool for many people -- with, for example, exoskeletons designed for running. ""Machines attached to our bodies will make us stronger and faster and more efficient."" In perhaps the emotional highlight of the conference, Herr told the story of a ballroom dancer whose left leg was amputated in last year's bombing at the Boston Marathon. In 200 days, Herr led a team at MIT that created a prosthetic limb, designed especially for her. And, indeed, Adrianne Haslet-Davis danced onstage for the first time since the bombing at the end of Herr's talk. Herr struck a defiant note against the violence of terrorism, as well as other things that hold people back: ""Humans are not disabled; our built environments, our technologies are disabled."" And in the ultimate statement of technological optimism, TED announced that it will help support a new XPrize, which will be presented to ""the first artificial intelligence to come to this stage and give a TED Talk compelling enough to win a standing ovation from the audience."" TED's Chris Anderson said the aim is to see whether the computing power of a Watson-style computer can be combined with enough creativity to develop ideas, though he conceded it may take decades. The ethics of technology were just as evident an issue in Vancouver as its possibilities. Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who invented the World Wide Web, urged that the Web's 25th anniversary be used as an occasion to develop a Magna Carta that establishes basic rights to privacy and free speech online. In an interview at TED with Charlie Rose, Google co-founder and chief executive Larry Page said he was ""tremendously disappointed"" that the U.S. government didn't fully disclose its surveillance programs. Asked about the issue of privacy and data collection by companies like Google, he said ""the main thing we need to do on privacy is just provide people choice."" He argued that privacy needs to be balanced with the benefits of sharing information. Page, who suffers from partly paralyzed vocal cords, said, ""When I had this problem with my voice, I was scared to share it."" He said his Google-co founder Brin encouraged him to go public with the news, and Page said much useful information was exchanged about the condition. ""Wouldn't it be great to have medical records online anonymously?"" he said, so people could research doctors and treatments. Retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal was also focused on sharing information in his talk. A culture of secrecy is crippling for a team that needs to recognize and respond to threats, he said. ""Sharing is power ... I am more afraid of a bureaucrat who keeps information in a desk drawer than of someone who leaks."" The NSA deputy director, Ledgett, said leaks like Snowden's do damage, but also conceded that the NSA hasn't been as transparent on its programs as it should have been. He said the threats the agency combats today include cyberwar and the stealing of companies' intellectual property by nations that use it to empower their state-owned enterprises. Computer hacking was cited as a force for good by Keren Elazari, a security researcher at GigaOM. She conceded some hackers give in to the temptation to read personal e-mails or add zeroes to their bank accounts. But she argued hackers are the immune system for the information age, experts at revealing the vulnerability of the Web. ""They force us to fix things or demand something better, she said. ""It's not information that wants to be free, it's us."" Elazari recalled that she saw NSA head Gen. Keith Alexander speak at a hackers' convention -- not to denounce hackers but to make a hiring pitch, but at TED, she offered the following advice: ""Then stop arresting us.""","TED conference featured Edward Snowden via telepresence robot .

"Of all the Boston Marathons he's worked, and he's done a half-dozen of them, Stephen Segatore figured this one would be pretty easy. The weather was cool, so the runners probably wouldn't be at much risk for heat stroke or dehydration. Maybe he'd help people with muscle cramps or twisted ankles, but not much more than that. Segatore, a nurse for 18 years, started his day Monday with the elite athletes in Medical Tent B toward the start of the race. Once those runners were well on their way, he transferred to Tent A at the finish line. He was talking to a group of doctors and nurses when they heard the first explosion. Instantly, a team meant to tend to the achy and exhausted became a trauma team. The first step: those who didn't have experience with trauma stepped aside. Those with experience dashed out in the direction of the noise. Segatore, who works in the intensive care unit at nearby Tufts Medical Center, had experience. ""I ran out and saw people who were missing legs and part of their face and part of their abdomen,"" he said Monday evening. ""My training prepared me for what to do, but nothing can ever really prepare you for what you see."" Segatore was one of a team of dozens of doctors and nurses who volunteered at Monday's Boston Marathon. They worked quickly to stop bleeding and start IVs so patients could get into ambulances and to hospital emergency rooms. They treated dozens of patients without proper supplies for severe trauma, such as dressings and pain medications. ""No one expects to work at the Boston Marathon and end up at a terrorist attack,"" he said. One of his first patients was a young woman, he thinks maybe 20 or 22 years old, whose abdomen was torn open. Her left leg was broken and facing the wrong way and she wasn't breathing. He and his colleagues did CPR on her and kept checking for a pulse, but there was none. They stopped when they realized it was futile. She became the first patient in their makeshift morgue. Segatore and others checked her pockets for a wallet, an ID, a cell phone, anything that would help them find her parents' names. There was nothing. ""I still don't know who she was,"" he said. ""She had blonde hair, blue eyes, the all-American girl. She was probably a student somewhere in Boston."" ""I've seen people die all over the world, but I've never been this upset or angry in my career,"" Segatore said. ""This is the Boston Marathon. People come from all over the world and all of a sudden that world exploded on them."" Working alongside Segatore in Tent A was Jim Asaiante, a nurse in the emergency room at the UMass Memorial Medical Center in Worcester, Massachusetts. Asaiante didn't run out after the explosion. He has plenty of experience in trauma, but as a veteran of the Iraq War, he's also had plenty of experience with explosions. ""I heard the first IED (improvised explosive device), and I know there's never one. The bad guys always set up two or three,"" said Asaiante, an Army captain who did an 18-month tour in Iraq in 2006 and 2007. Another victim was brought into the tent, a man with his calves and feet blown off and blood pumping out of his knees. Asaiante put a tourniquet on him, started an IV, and in 15 minutes the man, who was screaming in pain, was in an ambulance. After the second explosion, Asaiante ran out of the tent. ""There was lots of bleeding, shrapnel, glass. It was mayhem,"" he said. ""The injuries were very similar to Iraq."" Despite the chaos, he said the work of the doctors, nurses and EMTs was ""impeccable."" Segatore agreed. ""The most amazing thing was how everyone worked in tandem. They didn't even have to speak a word between each other,"" he said. ""In 20 years of nursing, this was the most amazing two hours of nursing in my life.""","Segatore: ""No one expects to work at the (marathon) and end up at a terrorist attack""

"Twenty-year-old Cherise Peters brims with ambition. Her positive attitude and unwavering determination to earn a doctorate in the medical field is unusual for a woman who was homeless just this past year. Peters, like many homeless young people, had been living with abuse and violence at home, she says. She turned to the streets as a way out. ""As soon as I started living on the streets, I felt like it should stop because I had nothing. I wanted to get a job. I had no documents. I was incognito to the world."" One out of 45 children experience some form of homelessness each year, according to the National Center on Family Homelessness. Many have aged out of foster care or have been victimized by sex trafficking or have simply been abandoned. Peters says she spent about eight months living on the streets of New York with a boyfriend who turned out to be wrecking her life. ""I would tell him, 'We have to get out of the streets' and he's like, 'I'm comfortable. We found a bed.' We shouldn't be comfortable -- we are outside."" She also dropped out of high school when she ran away. After eight months, something had to give.  Eventually she dumped the boyfriend and found refuge at the Covenant House. Covenant House International has served over a million homeless youth in the United States, Canada and Latin America as a bridge from poverty to opportunity, according to their own statistics. Besides providing basic needs like food, shelter and immediate health services, the organization tries to prepare homeless kids to live successful and independent lives. ""There are so many programs they have here and offer that there is no excuse why you can't be more than what you were when you got here,"" Peters says. Peters is a resident in their long term transitional living program, Rights of Passage. The program trains at risk kids to find and keep a job, save money, pay bills on time, cook healthy meals and clean. It also requires them to turn over a part of their salary to the Covenant House to be doled out at the end of their stay into a savings account. President and CEO, Kevin Ryan is inspired by the transformation he sees every day in his residents. ""The reward of this work at Covenant House is watching kids claim their place in the universe: their first graduation, first apartment, first great report card -- all of those moments of them claiming their dignity."" Peters currently is training to become a medical assistant. She is also working to complete high school and start college. ""No one is hungrier to prove themselves than a homeless young person that gets that first break,"" Ryan says. Ryan wants to transform the sense of rejection and despair that can come from homelessness into the approval and trust earned in a nurturing environment like Covenant House. ""The least interesting thing about these kids is that they're homeless. They are actors and artists and poets and teachers and students and interns. So many of them are going to college or working really hard to graduate from high school. They're striving. They're enduring. They're healing. They're rising.""

"(CNN) -- The religious leader behind plans to erect an Islamic center and mosque a few blocks from New York's ground zero said Wednesday night that America's national security depends on how it handles the controversy. ""If we move from that location, the story will be the radicals have taken over the discourse,"" Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf told CNN's Soledad O'Brien on ""Larry King Live."" ""The headlines in the Muslim world will be that Islam is under attack."" The imam, who repeatedly said his mission was to promote peace and build a bridge among faiths, said he was also speaking about ""radicals"" on both sides of the debate on the Islamic center. ""Our national security now hinges on how we negotiate this, how we speak about it."" ""The battlefront is between moderates of all sides... and the radicals on all sides,"" he said. Moving the project to another location would strengthen Islamist radicals' ability to recruit followers and will likely increase violence against Americans, the imam said. Rauf said that ""nothing is off the table"" when asked whether he would consider moving the site. ""We are consulting, talking to various people about how to do this so that we negotiate the best and safest option."" The imam told O'Brien ""had I known [the controversy] would happen we certainly would never have done this."" Asked if he meant he would not have picked the location, Rauf said, ""we would not have done something that would create more divisiveness."" Worry over what some observers have termed ""Islamophobia"" has been heightened by a Gainesville, Florida, church's plan to burn copies of the Quran on Saturday, the ninth anniversary of the 2001 attacks on New York and Washington. Rauf said he hopes the church reconsiders. ""It is something that is not the right thing to do."" ""With freedom comes responsibility,"" he said. ""This is dangerous to our national security and is also the un-Christian thing to do. ... Jesus said to love your enemy. We are not your enemy."" Responding to a poll showing 71 percent of New Yorkers oppose the center's location, Rauf he was going on television to explain his background and vision. ""I want to show them my face. Show them my track record."" The imam spoke of ""a vision I've had for almost 15 years ... to establish a space that embodies the fundamental . beliefs that we have as Jews, Christians and Muslims, which is to love our God and to love our neighbor -- to build a space where we have a culture of worship."" Rauf said he would continue speaking with families of those killed in the September 11, 2001, attacks. ""You cannot heal a trauma by walking away from it,"" he said. Opposition goes against ""the fundamental American principle of separation of church and state,"" said Rauf, adding he has been surprised by the controversy. The project, known as Park51, is slated to include a variety of facilities, including a prayer room, a performing arts center, gym, swimming pool and other public spaces. It is planned for a site two blocks from the World Trade Center. A source familiar with Park51 told CNN's Allan Chernoff last week that the structure is being planned as an 11-story building. It will cover 120,000 square feet -- 10,000 feet of which would be designated for the Muslim prayer space. The developer is considering the possibility of an interfaith education/meditation/prayer space as well, the source said. Opponents of the plan to build the center say it is too close to the site of the terror attacks and is an affront to the memory of those who died in the al Qaeda strike. Backers cite, among other things, First Amendment rights and the need to express religious tolerance. Those who know Rauf describe him as a thoughtful man, a bridge builder who seeks to unite all faiths but who won't parse words when he sees religion used for nefarious ends. But he has landed in controversy before. He has chided the U.S. for killing civilians in Baghdad. He said in 2005 that the U.S. had more Muslim blood on its hands than ""al Qaeda has on its hands of innocent non-Muslims."" He has refused to accept Western governments' designation of Hamas as a terrorist group. Shortly after the 9/11 attacks, he told CBS' ""60 Minutes"" that ""United States policies were an accessory to the crime."" Earlier this week, Rauf wrote a commentary published online by the New York Times. ""I have been struck by how the controversy has riveted the attention of Americans, as well as nearly everyone I met in my travels,"" Rauf wrote. ""We have all been awed by how inflamed and emotional the issue of the proposed community center has become,"" wrote Rauf, who had just returned from a State Department-sponsored Middle East trip to promote U.S.-Muslim relations. ""The level of attention reflects the degree to which people care about the very American values under debate: recognition of the rights of others, tolerance and freedom of worship.""

"Two lawsuits say the national chapter of the Phi Kappa Tau fraternity allowed a culture of ""violent misogyny"" after an internal email from the Georgia Tech chapter leaked last year instructing fraternity members on how to lure ""rapebait."" The lawsuits were filed Thursday in an Atlanta court on behalf of two anonymous women -- listed as Jane Doe and June Doe -- alleging they were sexually assaulted in separate incidents in 2012 and 2014 at the Georgia Tech chapter fraternity house based on a fraternity playbook for targeting women. The Phi Kappa Tau  national chapter, the now suspended local chapter and the chapter adviser are named as defendants in both lawsuits. These aren't lawsuits ""against the perpetrator. The student was pursued by the school and expelled. (Phi Kappa Tau) failed to take action and allowed a dangerous environment to fester, allowing the rape of two women,"" Cari Simon, the attorney representing the two women, told CNN on Friday. Simon's firm said the same fraternity member was involved in both incidents. No criminal charges have been filed, the fraternity said. ""The complaints highlight an offensive email and disturbing statements made in 2013 by chapter members and attempt to somehow link the alleged sexual assaults in 2012 and 2014 to that conduct,"" the fraternity said in a statement. ""The Fraternity is disappointed that the plaintiffs' attorney chose to exploit the hypersensitivity of today's college environment towards sexual assault by drafting the complaints in a manner that sensationalizes completely inappropriate statements, while at the same time alleging that a Georgia Tech student committed criminal rapes of two different women."" Simon, the plaintiffs' attorney, said, ""I totally agree that the language is salacious, but it's the words of their own members."" She said the suits were seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. Opinion: 'Rapebait' email reveals dark side of frat culture . The leaked email contained references to using alcohol as a means of sexual persuasion and attracted the attention of online communities and social media sites. The fraternity member who wrote the email apologized in Georgia Tech's student newspaper last year. Identified only as ""Matthew,"" he said that he was his chapter's social chair and that the email was a joke and should never have been written in the first place. Matthew wrote the email but is not the person accused of sexual assault. ""Misogynistic behavior is everywhere online and unfortunately, my attempt to ridicule it in an immature and outrageous satire backfired terribly and in a manner I mistakenly underestimated,"" he wrote in the Technique, the student newspaper.

"After Sunday's commuter rail derailment next to the Hudson River in New York killed four passengers and injured scores more, observers are once again ready to assail the backwards state of the nation's rail infrastructure. How could Americans let something like this happen in the 21st century in one of the nation's greatest global cities? The train was going a shocking 82 mph when it should have been traveling at 70 mph, slowing to 30 mph into the curve at Spuyten Duyvil station in the Bronx. The engineer of the train said he was ""in a daze"" at the time of the accident. Don't we have technologies that can prevent trains from gathering and maintaining such speed at dangerous curves --  or technologies that can automatically deploy the brakes if they do? If these technologies exist, and we know they do, are we simply not investing properly in our trains and tracks and signaling systems? Surely there will be an outcry about the sad state of New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority funding, and the funding of the nation's rails and infrastructure networks as a whole. Much of the developed world has invested heavily in high-speed rail and yet the United States, with a massive market for long-distance intercity rail travel, has not even scratched its surface. Our governors have balked at support for high-speed links, channeling federal subsidies instead to more politically popular state projects like roads, highways and bridges -- leaving high-speed intercity travel a dream and our regional rail systems an uneven patchwork of service. But the lessons of the Spuyten Duyvil derailment won't be known for some time, and they likely aren't so simple as more investment. For a start, the technology that could have potentially prevented the fatal derailment -- positive train control, or PTC, is already being deployed on freight lines across the country. Mandated by the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008, tens of thousands of track side devices are being connected to rail signals and switches to communicate wirelessly with retrofitted locomotives up and down the country's major rail thoroughfares. Engineers operating trains with PTC systems will be told and shown in real time exactly where and how much they need to slow down, based on the curvature of the track, on congestion and on the train's speed, weight and length. Failure to respond to the computer data will result in automatic deployment of the train's brakes. Widow says train crash victim was 'pure goodness"" Its nice to think that entirely new systems incorporating new and faster cars would make derailments disappear into the history books, but they probably won't. Although the absence of high-speed technologies in this country means that rail travel is not an attractive option for certain long-distance journeys and contributes to higher levels of pollution and road congestion in places, it doesn't really make rail travel any less safe. Indeed, countries with high-speed rail have roughly the same rate of derailments and crashes as we do -- often with far more serious consequences. Take China for example. Within five years of announcing its extraordinary $250 billion investment in 7,500 miles of high-speed rail, the country opened its first high-speed line. The same year, 2008, a horrific train crash on the Beijing to Quindao bullet train line claimed 70 lives. Three years later, in 2011, a signal failure along one of the new high-speed rail routes out of the capital claimed another 40 lives and injured 192 -- leading to public outrage and questions about the integrity of the nation's entire high-speed rail program. Europe's investments in its intercity networks are typically older and more established than those of China -- but they are not immune to rail tragedy either.  Despite extensive and popular programs of high-speed rail, both Spain and France have had their share of train accidents. Video footage of a 2013 derailment in northwest Spain, just outside Santiago de Compostela, displays an eerie resemblance to Sunday's Hudson Line accident. A passenger train rounded a bend at roughly twice the speed it should have, coming off the rails adjacent to a station and killing 78 people. The problem was apparently not mechanical -- it was human error. Does any of this mean we should be complacent when an incident as tragic as Sunday's happens? Of course not. We should leave no stone unturned in identifying the cause of the crash. If it is ultimately attributed to an equipment failure, we should and will likely see a renewed call for greater capital investment on the part of the MTA -- and perhaps even legislative action to support it. But we shouldn't be naïve enough to think that more investment in our rail network in the form of newer or faster equipment necessarily makes the network safer. That investment must be smarter for it to really save lives. Although unions across the transportation world typically balk at its introduction, increased automation is often the answer to transportation safety problems. The train control systems being deployed are likely to reduce the risks of accidents like that witnessed on Sunday dramatically -- much the same way automation in planes and cars has reduced pilot errors in the sky and made road driving safer. But even the most sophisticated vehicle control systems in the world will not protect us completely from human error -- for that we have only ourselves to blame.","Kate Ascher: After deadly train derailment in New York, people lament state of U.S. rail system .

"A 67-year-old woman who reportedly received millions in life insurance money from at least five of her previous partners has been arrested on suspicion of poisoning her last husband with cyanide -- the latest high-profile case in Japan involving so-called ""black widows."" Chisako Kakehi, who benefited to the tune of 800 million yen ($6.8 million) over the past 20 years, according to Japanese media, denies any wrongdoing. ""I didn't kill him. I don't know how to kill ..."" she told police, according to CNN affiliate TV Asahi. But an autopsy report on Isao Kakehi, her fourth husband to die, found cyanide in his stomach and blood. The 75-year old died in December, less than two months after their wedding. It triggered a police investigation into the case, which culminated in Kakehi's arrest in Kyoto on Wednesday. A previous fiancé, who died when he crashed his motorcycle, was also found to have traces of cyanide in his body. Police would only say ""many"" of her previous partners -- who were aged between 54 and 75 -- had died in the past two decades. Autopsies rare . However, authorities may be unable to prove she killed her other lovers because autopsies are generally rare in Japan. Her first husband died back in 1994. Kakehi is the latest ""black widow"" to make the headlines in Japan. Kanae Kijima is currently in prison after being found guilty of killing three men she met on dating websites in 2009 and making it look like suicide in each case. She was 37 at the time. That same year, bar worker Miyuki Ueta, 40, was found guilty of drugging and drowning two men she reportedly owed money to. Both are appealing death sentences.","Seven of Chisako Kakehi's previous partners have died in 20 years .

"I usually catch myself before I utter the p-word to one of my daughters, but every once in a while it comes flying out of my mouth and I cringe. ""You look perfect,"" I might say when one of them gets dressed up for a holiday. After I say it, I immediately wish I had my own personal eraser button because I've been plagued by an intense perfectionism for pretty much my entire life -- and the last thing I want to do is pass along that horrible trait to my children. It began with the quest to be the perfect daughter, then student, then news correspondent, then career woman, then wife and now mother. I consider myself improving based upon the fact that I didn't get up at 4:30 a.m. to write the perfect piece. I figured sleep is just as important. Opinion: Why is having 'having it all' just a women's issue? I know I am not alone. In her new book, ""Wonder Women: Sex, Power and the Quest for Perfection,"" Debora Spar, who is president of Barnard College, talks about that relentless need that many of us modern women feel to be perfect in every aspect of our lives. For some reason, nearly 50 years after Betty Friedan's ""The Feminine Mystique"" and the women's movement, we morphed feminism into perfectionism, says Spar. ""I'm not entirely sure why but I think one of the things that happened without anyone meaning for it to happen is that as we generationally all got excited with these tremendous opportunities that were being created for women, we kind of built a myth and an illusion around it,"" said Spar, a mother of three, during a recent interview in which she got very personal. She revealed she had a breast reduction at age 21 because she felt her body would keep her from being taken seriously as a professional. (You can see the full interview here.) The myth about balancing motherhood and a successful career . The media definitely played a role in our perfectionism, Spar said, pointing to commercials like one for Revlon's Charlie perfume in the '70s, which I still remember so vividly. It featured the model Shelley Hack, playing a sleek and sexy businesswoman with a baby who dazzles her husband and every other man who passes her by. That's how life was supposed to be for the modern working woman, right? And it was supposed to be easy, too? ""I think that's really the kicker,"" said Spar. ""We not only thought that we would have all of these things at once but that somehow we would glide into this life without really having to work very hard, without struggling, without failing, without getting depressed, and the result of that sadly is that when our lives of course become harder and become messier we somehow feel like we failed."" Sheryl Sandberg at BlogHer: Not everyone woman has to be a CEO . While we've been at this perfectionism thing for several decades now, and habits are oh-so-tough to break, Spar offers some great tips on how we can slowly try to change, and also, perhaps most importantly, shares tips on how we can prevent our daughters from following in our not-so-perfect footsteps. 1.Fess Up -- Women who look like they have it all should start admitting the truth, says Spar. ""And admit that even if I look like I'm keeping all the balls in the air, they're dropping all over the place,"" she said. It may seem like a small thing but the power of women talking candidly about the decisions they make and being more honest about the tradeoffs that ""everybody's life entails"" can hopefully take some of the pressure off women and girls, she added. 2.Say No -- N-O. I am spelling the word because it is just so darn hard for me to say, and that's part of my problem, and the problem of so many other modern women. Spar says we should write down everything we are doing in our lives, cut out three or four responsibilities we can get rid of and then ""say no consciously"" to additional tasks. ""I think where I get into trouble and I see lots of people getting into trouble is when you say maybe. 'I'll try to be there. I'll try to do it.' Just say, 'I don't do that. I don't travel on weekends. I don't go to conferences. I don't do bake sales,' whatever it is and just consciously say, 'I'm not going to do that.'"" (My mother-in-law uses a fabulous expression: ""Gee, that doesn't work for me."" It works every time I have the courage to say it!) 3.Get rid of the guilt -- How many times do you say yes to a work event or a social outing because you feel like you should be there and not because you really want to attend? Spar says her son came up with a list for her. ""Every time I was considering whether or not to go to an event, he would say, 'Is it good for your job? Do you have to go? And will it be fun? And if the answer to all those three questions is no, don't go.' And it's amazing how many things fall off your calendar if you run through that little list."" 4.'Satisfice' -- It's a term that comes out of economics and is often used by negotiators. It means not going for your first best option, said Spar, but it doesn't mean settling for less. It just means having a ""whole array of options"" to consider. ""Because all too often I think we think in black and white terms. If I'm not secretary of state, I've failed. If I'm not running the corporation, I've failed. Well, what's the next step down, what's the third step down? And I think it's a useful concept to realize that just because you didn't get exactly what you wanted doesn't mean you didn't get something that's really good,"" she said. (Incidentally, Spar says her dream ""was"" to be secretary of state. I noted, ""There's still time!"") 5.It's about men, too -- We can't do this all by ourselves, says Spar. Our husbands, brothers and male colleagues need to be part of it, too. ""Men obviously have to pick up some of the housework, some of the child care and women have to let men do that,"" she added. ""I won't let my husband make the school lunches because he's not going to do it quite as beautifully as I will. He's not going to ask all of the right questions at the parent-teacher conference, so I always have to go, too. We have to move away from that and I think there are a lot of men who really want to be more involved in their kids' life and in their home life but sometimes the women are shutting them out because the men will do things differently.""

"Mass shootings in 2012 reignited the debate over legislation to combat gun violence. Here's a look at laws already on the books in the United States dealing with firearms. 1791 -- Second Amendment: Congress ratifies the Second Amendment to the Constitution, which reads that ""A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed."" 1934 -- National Firearms Act: The law was designed to make it difficult to obtain especially lethal guns. These would include preferred weapons of the era's gangsters, like sawed-off long rifles or shotguns and machine guns. It also regulated specialty weapons concealed in canes, pens or other items. How the NRA wields its influence . 1968 -- Gun Control Act of 1968: Following the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, Congress passed this law prohibiting convicted felons from possessing firearms. It also required licenses to trade in guns and created procedures to track serial numbers and control imports. 1984-1986 -- Comprehensive Crime Control Act and the Armed Career Criminal Act: These laws enhanced penalties for using or carrying firearms while committing serious drug offenses, for felons with three prior convictions of violent crimes or drug offenses, for using short-barreled rifles and shotguns and semiautomatic weapons and for automatic weapons or those equipped with a silencer. 1986 -- The Firearms Owners' Protection Act of 1986: Allowed licensed dealers to operate outside of their normal places of business, like gun shows, and excluded hobbyists or collectors from some regulations. It permitted sales of ammunition without a license, allowed convicted felons to obtain guns if their civil rights were restored after prison, and banned the production of machine guns for civilian use. It also made it illegal for anyone to sell firearms to those prohibited from owning them. Opinion: Let's take politics out of gun research . 1993 -- The Brady Law: After a seven-year legislative battle, Congress passed the Brady Handgun Violence Protection Act, which required background checks for those buying firearms. 1994 -- Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act: Increased fees and required photographs and fingerprints to obtain a dealer's license. 1994 -- Youth Handgun Safety Act: Banned possession of handguns by those under 18 and prohibited adults from transferring them to juveniles. 1994 -- Assault weapon ban: The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act made it unlawful, with a few exceptions, to make, transfer, or possess semiautomatic assault weapons. It also made it illegal to possess large capacity magazines that held more than 10 rounds. The law expired in 2004.

"Washington (CNN) -- A Saudi national living in Texas was arrested Wednesday for allegedly researching and acquiring chemicals to make a bomb, authorities said Thursday. Khalid Ali-M Aldawsari, 20, of Lubbock, Texas, allegedly researched several possible targets, including the Dallas home of former President George W. Bush. along with nuclear power plants and hydroelectric dams. Aldawsari was arrested in Lubbock on a federal charge of attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction in connection with his alleged purchase of chemicals and equipment necessary to make an improvised explosive device, according to the Justice Department. Aldawsari is expected to make his initial appearance in federal court in Lubbock Friday morning, the Department of Justice said. Aldawsari, who was lawfully admitted into the United States in 2008 on a student visa and is enrolled at South Plains College near Lubbock, faces a maximum sentence of life in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted of attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction, officials said. According to court records, Aldawsari conducted online research into how to construct an improvised explosive device, or IED, using several chemicals as ingredients. He has also ""acquired or taken a substantial step toward acquiring most of the ingredients and equipment"" needed for the bomb, documents said. Authorities said Aldawsari described his desire for violent jihad and martyrdom in blog postings and a personal journal. Aldawsari conducted research on various targets and e-mailed himself information on these locations and people, the Justice Department said. On February 6, the affidavit alleges, Aldawsari sent himself an email titled ""Tyrant's House,"" in which he listed the Dallas address for former President George W. Bush, investigators said. In a personal journal found in Aldawsari's apartment home, Aldawsari wrote the events of September 11, 2001, had produced a ""big change"" in his thinking and that he had been inspired by the speeches of Osama bin Laden, the affidavit said. He had excelled in high school in order to take advantage of scholarship opportunities offered by Saudi companies to get to the United States, he wrote, and had been planning to commit a terrorist attack in the United States for years, according to the affidavit. Aldawsari allegedly wrote the scholarship ""will help tremendously in providing me with the support I need for Jihad."" The entry continued: ""And now, after mastering the English language, learning how to build explosives and continuous planning to target the infidel Americans, it is time for Jihad,"" the affidavit says. Aldawsari's alleged plan first came to the attention of authorities only three weeks ago, on January 30, when Con-way Freight, a shipping company, became suspicious after Aldawsari allegedly  called the company and asked it to hold a package for him. Con-way Freight  company officials told police it had no relationship with Aldawsari that would  have allowed him to use the company as a shipping location, officials said. Investigators  learned the shipment involved the toxic chemical -- phenol -- which can  be used in making the explosive trinitrophenol, also known as TNP or picric acid. On February 8, an FBI agent posing as an employee of the North Carolina supply company that sent the chemicals called Aldawsari and asked why he wished to purchase the phenol, according to the records. Aldaswari falsely told the supplier he was associated with a university and wanted the chemical for ""off-campus, personal research,"" the affidavit says. Frustrated by his inability to obtain the chemicals, Aldawsari canceled the order and later e-mailed himself instructions for producing phenol. The affidavit alleges that Aldawsari also e-mailed himself instructions on how to convert a cellular phone into a remote detonator and how to prepare a booby-trapped vehicle using items available in every home. One email allegedly contained a message stating that ""one operation in the land of the infidels is equal to 10 operations against occupying forces in the land of the Muslims."" During December 2010 and January 2011, Aldawsari allegedly purchased many other items, including a gas mask, a hazardous materials suit, a soldering iron kit, glass beakers and flasks, wiring, a stun gun, clocks and a battery tester. Authorities said Aldawsari described his desire for violent jihad and martyrdom in blog postings, using the online user name ""fromfaraway90."" He expressed dissatisfaction with the current condition of Muslims, lamenting what he viewed as their passivity and pacifism, according to the affidavit. In another email to himself, titled ""NICE TARGETS,"" he listed two categories of targets: hydroelectric dams and nuclear power plants, the affidavit said. Other e-mails sent to himself, with the subject line ""Targets,"" contained the names and home addresses of three people who had previously served in the U.S. military at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, authorities alleged. ""As alleged in the complaint, Aldawsari purchased ingredients to construct an explosive device and was actively researching potential targets in the United States. Thanks to the efforts of many agents, analysts and prosecutors, this plot was thwarted before it could advance further,"" said David Kris, who is assistant attorney general for national security. ""This case serves as another reminder of the need for continued vigilance both at home and abroad."" A spokesman for former President Bush referred calls to the Secret Service. President Barack Obama was informed about the operation before the arrest was made, White House spokesman Nick Shapiro said. ""The president thanks the FBI, Department of Justice, and the rest of our law enforcement, intelligence and Homeland Security professionals who continue to keep us safe and who once again have served with extraordinary skill and with the commitment that their enormous responsibilities demand,"" Shapiro said. South Plains College said that it had been notified that one of its students had been detained, but didn't have further information on the arrest. A spokeswoman said that Aldawsari was a transfer student who had been at their college for only six weeks. CNN's Vivian Kuo and Jim Barnett contributed to this report.","Khalid Ali-M Aldawsari was a transfer student at South Plains College .

"It could be out with old meeting rooms and in with new social spaces, as Generation Y is set to transform the way we work in the next 10 years. In the U.S., those born between 1979 and 1997 are predicted to make up the largest part of the workforce within a decade and with it change offices and the nature of work itself. ""We are facing a huge generational shift, as baby boomers (born between 1946 and 1964) leave the workforce, and that means we have to rethink our workspace,"" says Michael O'Neill, senior director of workplace research for Knoll, Inc. By the end of the decade, the balance in the U.S. will flip from approximately 50% baby boomers and 25% Generation Y workers to 25% baby boomers and 50% Generation Y workers, according to a 2010 report from Knoll, a workplace furnishing company. ""That is a massive shift, and it will happen in less than eight years,"" says O'Neill. To understand how workspaces will need to change to accommodate and attract this new generation of workers, O'Neill and Knoll looked at the work patterns and preferences of more than 15,000 employees in 40 countries, and across four generations. Their findings reveal a number of generational differences. For example, Generation Y rates the importance of having an ""engaging workplace"" highest and the ""quality of meeting rooms"" lowest, while baby boomers rate these features opposite, with high importance on meeting rooms. ""Baby boomers like structured, face-to-face meetings,"" says O'Neill. That's how they usually get things done.  And if that's how you get things done, the quality of meeting spaces will be important to you."" Generation Y on the other hand, likes quick, casual and socially-tinged meetings. Their use of technology in interaction further undermines the importance of lengthy meetings and formal spaces, according to O'Neill. As for their top priority on an engaging workspace, Generation Y blends their personal and private life, and they like a workplace to feel residential and like home, says O'Neill, explaining that baby boomers don't expect or want spaces that evoke the emotional connectedness of home. ""They tend to separate their work life and their personal life,"" he says, adding that their focus is more on function and on efficient spaces. So how will this play out in the office of the future? ""It already does,"" says Alison Maitland, co-author of ""Future work: How business can adapt and thrive in the new world of work"". ""It is the idea of work being an activity and not a place. That is more important,"" she says, ""and it is already happening in companies like Unilever's Hamburg office and Microsoft's office in Amsterdam. ""The focus there is on collaboration and innovation, nobody has a permanent desk, and employees are encouraged to move around and work in a space that best suit their activity at any given time."" However, she emphasizes that the generational shift is just one of many variables pushing us into a new world of work. Changes in technology, the economy and businesses are all part of the shift. Read more: 8 ways to make your office life better . ""There used to be formulas for how to crank out an office building for a certain amount of people,"" says O'Neill. ""Now, designers are building a wider variety of rooms tailored to each company's function and direction. You are seeing more open meeting spaces, lounge furniture near circulation spaces and that type of thing. It is a shift from a 'me' to a 'we' workspace."" However, tearing down all these walls can be a challenge to baby boomers. ""It hurts when you take the office away,"" says O'Neill, ""because you feel like you have worked your whole career, and you've earned that. To baby boomers, the office is a status marker. To Generation Y, a status symbol is more likely to be whether or not it has the new iPad or a certain level of freedom."" Generation X (those born between 1965 and 1978) is a group that grew up with financial and work insecurity and has little in common with Generation Y or baby boomers, believes O'Neill. ""They tend to be more skeptical. Their focus is on security; they are more the 'show me the money' generation,"" he says. Are cool offices the key to success? So, how does a company maneuver this field of different generations and preferences? ""Be aware of your workforce and your employees' needs and wants,"" says Laura Sabattini, senior director of research at Catalyst, a non-profit organization that works to expand business opportunities for women. ""Assess the specific group because there is so much variation. That is a way to start creating a workforce that is inclusive."" Maitland agrees: ""Companies that are going to have three or four generations in their workplace really do need to think about those different work styles and different preferences. Falling over to accommodate only Generation Y would not be the most productive way and could backfire.""","Those born between 1979 and 1997 will be dominant age group in workforce in ten years .
Difference in values between baby boomers and Generation Y set to transform offices .
'Millennials' put more emphasis on flexibility, personal attachment to work, suggests report .
Analysts suggest  that offices need to be able to cater for all generations to thrive ."
"Tampa, Florida (CNN) -- A battle over Social Security launched last week between the top two GOP presidential contenders doesn't show any signs of quieting down as candidates prepare for round two at the first-ever CNN/Tea Party Republican Debate on Monday night. The debate, being held at the Florida State Fairgrounds in Tampa, will also give the six other candidates on the stage a chance to change what many are portraying as a two-person race between Texas Gov. Rick Perry and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. It all started Wednesday night at a debate at the Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California. Perry, the new guy in the race and the current front-runner in the national polls, and Romney, the previous front-runner in the GOP battle, sparred over jobs and Social Security. Perry stood by earlier comments that Social Security is a ""Ponzi scheme"" and that it was a ""monstrous lie"" to tell young workers that the 74-year-old pension system would be there when they retire. Romney fired back, saying that ""under no circumstances would I ever say by any measure it's a failure. It is working for millions of Americans, and I'll keep it working for millions of Americans."" Angry electorate sustains tea party movement . Since then, both candidates have swung at each other through e-mail and social media. In a radio interview, Romney went a step further. ""If we nominate someone who the Democrats can correctly characterize as being opposed to Social Security, we would be obliterated as a party,"" he said. Perry's team fired back, noting that in Romney's policy book ""No Apology,"" the former Massachusetts governor compared the management of Social Security to a felony. Then, the Perry campaign started highlighting comments Romney made August 24 in Lebanon, New Hampshire, 11 days after Perry jumped into the race. ""Republicans, like myself, are not gonna cut Social Security or Medicare for people who are retired or near retirement,"" Romney said at a campaign stop. ""And for the people who say we are, they are demagoguing an issue very much that harms America."" As for Romney's charge that Perry would possibly abolish the popular government program, Perry's team says that the Texas governor believes that Social Security must be protected for current beneficiaries and those nearing retirement age. The two candidates will once again be standing side-by-side at Monday night's CNN/Tea Party Republican Debate. CNN and the Tea Party Express, a leading national tea party organization, are teaming up to put on the event, with questions coming from the moderator, CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer, as well as from tea party activists, supporters in the audience and voters at locations in Arizona, Ohio and Virginia. ""You don't usually start a campaign by setting grandma's hair on fire,"" says GOP strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos. Timeline: Tea party movement . ""Rick Perry needs to make it clear in this debate that he stands by his Ponzi scheme caricaturization of Social Security. He can't back off that,"" said Castellanos, who was a top media adviser to the 2004 Bush-Cheney re-election campaign and to Romney's 2008 bid but is not taking sides this time cycle. ""But Perry also needs to make this clear: The 'Ponzi scheme' is what he would fix. Perry needs to reiterate that he has the same position as everyone else on stage: No changes for anyone at or near retirement, but we must save Social Security for those in the 'Ponzi scheme' now."" Monday night's debate could give Perry a second chance to make that point. ""Perry has to continue the momentum largely by showing a bit more polish than he did at the Reagan Library debate. He had energy and proved he belonged on the stage, but needs to help independents feel comfortable with him,"" says Rich Galen, a Republican strategist who advised Fred Thompson during his 2008 GOP presidential bid. He is the author of Mullings.com, an online column. As for Romney, who's making his second run for the White House, Galen says he should ""try and continue to plant seeds of doubt in the minds of anyone to the left of the evangelical right that Perry can be trusted to be president."" Castellanos thinks that Romney ""has to continue to do what he's done in previous debates: Be steady, presidential and remain unswervingly focused on economics: growth, deficit reduction and jobs."" And Castellanos has this prediction: ""This debate will be a battle between 'RomneyCare' and 'PerryCare'. Perry imposed a mandate on 12-year-old girls, requiring them to get the HPV 'sex vaccine' whether their parents liked it or not. A lot of Republicans will think that is worse than Romney's health care mandate in Massachusetts."" Any showdowns over Social Security and the economy will also draw in the other six candidates sharing the stage: U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, U.S. Rep. Ron Paul of Texas, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, former Godfather's Pizza CEO and radio talk show host Herman Cain, former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania and former Utah Gov. and former U.S. Ambassador to China Jon Huntsman. Bachmann interjected herself into the Social Security discussion. ""America needs to keep its promise to senior citizens, I talk to them all the time. I love senior citizens. I care about them. My mom is 80 years old, and my dad is 87,"" the congresswoman said in an interview Friday on CNN's ""John King USA."" She believes that Social Security needs to be reformed, but ""we have to keep our promises with senior citizens."" The debate is crucial to Bachmann, who has dropped in national polling since Perry launched his campaign on August 13, the very same day that she won a crucial straw poll in Ames, Iowa. She had strong debate performances at presidential debates in New Hampshire in June and Iowa in August, but she didn't shine to the same degree last week. ""Bachmann must get back into the game,"" says Galen. ""This may be her last chance to stay in the game."" The debate may not be as crucial for Paul, who's making his third bid for the White House. He has energetic and enthusiastic supporters and has little problem when it comes to raising campaign funds, but for some of the other candidates, a strong performance on Monday night could be crucial to driving their fundraising. ""They need to score some debating points so they can generate enough donations to make it to the next debate and, ultimately, to the point where they qualify for matching funds to pay off debts,"" adds Galen. But what makes this debate different is its connection to the tea party, a 2 1/2-year-old grassroots movement that calls for lower taxes and less government spending and regulations. The movement was extremely influential in last year's GOP primaries in the midterm elections, and strong support from tea party activists helped the Republicans win back control of the House of Representatives. It's expected that the tea party movement will be just as influential in the battle for the GOP presidential nomination. ""The tea party movement has become a powerful movement in American politics. Over the past two years, we have changed the political landscape of Washington, D.C. Not only have we had an impact in elections, but we have also affected legislation on a level that no one expected,"" says Tea Party Express chair Amy Kremer. ""Because of these successes, it only makes sense that the tea party would engage in presidential politics. We are not going to just accept what the Republican Party wants to give to us. The people across America are tired of party politics, so it will be the people of this movement that will determine the next Republican nominee.""

"There could be few who would begrudge JB Holmes his eventual victory in the Wells Fargo Championship at Quail Hollow Sunday. The American has had to battle back from double brain surgery in 2011 and career-threatening injuries two years later, only regaining his full power and long-hitting ability this season. All the hard work paid off as the overnight leader carded a final round 71 for 14-under 274 -- winning by a shot from Jim Furyk, who carded a superb last round 65, with another American, Martin Flores, a shot further back. It was his first win since the FBR Open in 2008 -- the year he played in the winning U.S. Ryder Cup team -- and first top three finish since 2010. A host of golf's big names were set to mount a challenge, but U.S. Open champion Justin Rose of England could not advance with a closing 71 and finished fifth, while Phil Mickelson slumped to a four-over 76 to close on seven-under-par. Zimbabwe's Brendon de Jonge was left to rue his first round 80 after which he made a stunning recovery, equaling the course record with a 62 to make an unlikely cut and then closing with weekend rounds of 68 and 69. It left him tied for sixth on nine-under, a remarkable comeback, and one shot clear of former champion Rory McIlroy, who closed with a 70. McIlroy was also left to rue his second round 76, which undermined his challenge, but again showed signs he was returning to the form he showed in 2012 when he went to the top of the rankings. But it was Holmes who came out on top, keeping his nerve in the face of a determined challenge from veteran Furyk, having the luxury of being able to finish with a last hole bogey -- holing the winning putt from four feet. The 32-year-old from Kentucky developed vertigo in 2011 and had to have a piece of his skull removed to treat the condition.  An allergic reaction to the operation saw him back in surgery just a month later. Last year Holmes broke his left ankle while rollerblading and also had elbow surgery on his left elbow and had to battle back again to full fitness.","JB Holmes wins Wells Fargo Championship .

"Irbil, Iraq (CNN)After hours of heavy fighting, Kurdish fighters in Iraq have repelled an assault by ISIS fighters southwest of Irbil, Kurdish officials said. Kurdish commanders say ISIS fighters had threatened to overrun Kurdish defensive positions in the area for a while, and the two sides were so close that airstrikes were not possible. But by 3 a.m. local time Wednesday, the Peshmerga had succeeded in forcing ISIS back, allowing airstrikes to begin. The commanders said about 40 ISIS fighters were killed, and Kurdish forces suffered several casualties. They said airstrikes contributed to the ISIS deaths. ISIS launched the major assault from several directions Tuesday night near the towns of Gwer and Makhmour. The towns are about 45 kilometers (28 miles) from Irbil, the Kurdish capital. A CNN team was in the area less than two weeks ago and was told by fighters at the front that ISIS was making almost daily attempts to infiltrate through Kurdish lines, which are strung out along a stretch of the River Zab. Fortifications are few and far between. Volunteer fighters have very little in the way of weaponry. In January, nearly 30 Peshmerga fighters were killed in the area by a surprise ISIS attack across the river. Kurdish fighters battle equipment woes as well as ISIS in northern Iraq . Kurdish officials said they were concerned ISIS fighters would break through their lines. Had that happened, there would be little standing between ISIS and the Kurdish capital. Tuesday's attacks were likely aimed at drawing the already stretched Kurdish forces in many different directions to relieve the pressure on Mosul, which ISIS seized in June. Kurdish forces recently have been trying to surround Mosul to cut off ISIS' lines of supply from Syria, setting up what could be an eventual assault to try to expel the terror group from the city. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet and Holly Yan contributed to this report.","Kurdish commanders say about 40 ISIS fighters were killed .

"(CNN) -- Yahoo misled Congress regarding information the Internet company gave to Chinese authorities about the journalist Shi Tao, Democratic Rep. Tom Lantos said Tuesday. Yahoo officials have been asked to testify before a House committee in November about a Chinese journalist's case. Lantos, a California representative and chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, asked Yahoo Inc. officials to testify about the company's role in a case that sent Chinese newspaper writer and editor Shi to prison on a 10-year sentence. Lantos asked Yahoo Chief Executive Officer Jerry Yang and Senior Vice President and General Counsel Michael Callahan to appear November 6. ""Our committee has established that Yahoo provided false information to Congress in early 2006,"" Lantos said in a written statement. ""We want to clarify how that happened, and to hold the company to account for its actions both before and after its testimony proved untrue. And we want to examine what steps the company has taken since then to protect the privacy rights of its users in China."" The newspaper reporter had posted information under a pseudonym on an overseas Web site called Democracy Forum about a government crackdown on media and democracy activists, Lantos said. Shi was later arrested in his home in Beijing after Yahoo gave Chinese authorities information about his e-mail account, his computer address, his log-on history and the contents of several weeks of his e-mail, Lantos said. Lantos said a Yahoo official testified last year that the company knew nothing ""about the nature of the investigation"" of Shi, a pro-democracy activist now serving time on what Lantos called ""trumped-up charges."" ""We have now learned there is much more to the story than Yahoo let on, and a Chinese government document that Yahoo had in their possession at the time of the hearing left little doubt of the government's intentions,"" said Republican Rep. Chris Smith of New Jersey. ""U.S. companies must hold the line and not work hand in glove with the secret police."" In a written statement, Yahoo spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler said Yahoo representatives have been truthful with Congress. He called the House committee's accusation ""grossly unfair"" and said it ""mischaracterizes the nature and intent of our past testimony."" During a February 2006 subcommittee hearing on limits to freedom on the Internet in China, Lantos and Smith questioned Callahan about Shi. Callahan testified to the subcommittee that Yahoo handed over the information to Chinese authorities at a time when it knew nothing about the investigation, Lantos said. But the San Francisco, California-based human-rights group The Dui Hua Foundation released documents in July indicating police in China had written to Yahoo saying they were seeking evidence about Shi for illegally ""providing state secrets to foreign entities,"" a charge frequently levied against political dissidents in China. ""This new documentation suggests that Yahoo's Beijing office was at least aware of the general nature of the crime being investigated in the Shi Tao case,"" said Joshua Rosenzweig, manager of research and publications for The Dui Hua Foundation. Even if Yahoo was unaware of the specific circumstances of the Chinese government's inquiry, ""One does not have to be an expert in Chinese law to know that 'state secrets' charges have often been used to punish political dissent in China,"" said Rosenzweig. Shi has appealed his 10-year sentence for divulging state secrets, saying he did not know the information he shared was classified. He accused the police of using improper procedures in the investigation and arrest. In addition, he has filed suit in U.S. federal court against Yahoo and its Hong Kong-based subsidiary. Yahoo's spokeswoman said the company is working with other companies and the human rights community ""to develop a global code of conduct for operating in countries around the world, including China.""

"When Secretary of State John Kerry first took office he talked of changing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's calculus. Assad ""needs to know that he can't shoot his way out of this,"" Kerry said in March at a Rome meeting with members of the Syrian opposition. When he and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov first conceived the idea of bringing the regime and the opposition together for peace talks in Geneva, they believed strengthened international support for both the political opposition and rebel forces would leave the Syrian leader ready to negotiate his own ouster. U.S. policy since then has had the opposite effect. Assad's calculus has indeed changed. The political opposition is on the verge of collapse, rebel groups now having to battle the growing strength of Islamist forces on the ground, and his regime is at the center of implementing an international deal to rid the country of chemical weapons. He heads to Geneva believing the false narrative that he is even more powerful. As his forces continue to kill thousands each week from barrel bombs with impunity, Assad has no reason to think he can't shoot his way out of the crisis. Representatives of Syria's main opposition group voted Saturday to attend next week's peace talks in Geneva. Leading up to the vote, the opposition was bitterly divided on whether to attend at all. Members of the opposition suggest that the United States is setting them up to fail by not providing the Free Syrian Army with sufficient resources to change the balance of power on the ground. ""Is the opposition being set up for success by United States, not just to participate in a conference that will lead to a political solution, but being empowered to ensure success of the stated objectives of Geneva?"" asked Oubai Shahbandar, a senior adviser to the opposition. ""It is the position of the opposition that you cannot have a successful political process if the U.S. doesn't also increase its support. Right now, the regime thinks its winning. They think they have successfully avoided military strikes, western sanctions and repercussions for continued war crimes. It is these components that make any successful outcomes of Geneva unlikely,"" Shahbandar said. For months, U.S. Ambassador to Syria Robert Ford has shuttled to Turkey to meet with members of the Syrian National Council. In preparing for Geneva, Ford and other U.S. officials repeatedly urged the opposition to present a transition plan that saw the group playing a major role in a post al-Assad government, which could include some elements of the current government. Now the group is being implored to just show up. The Obama administration maintains it still believes al-Assad should step down. But rather than hand over power, he is talking about running for re-election this spring in what is all but certain to be a fraudulent election. And the opposition, whose legitimacy is mostly conferred upon them by the international community, appears to be in no position to force his hand. ""The Syrian opposition is in a space capsule heading toward Geneva and breaking up in the atmosphere and this may be one of the West's biggest failures,"" says Salman Sheikh, director of the Brookings Doha Center. ""Geneva has put unbearable pressure on an opposition that has always lacked unity and direction and this has a great bearing for any process the international powers are looking to launch,"" Sheikh said. Having lacked resolve to either use force against al-Assad or arm the opposition, and with no coming together of the Security Council on even the growing humanitarian crisis, the Obama administration now has fewer tools in the toolbox. What's left is the diplomatic ""fig leaf"" of Geneva, which few people besides Kerry believe is more than an effort to check the diplomatic box and manage some sort of response to the Syrian crisis, rather than demonstrating the mettle to find a solution. ""Despite how everyone tries to dress it up, this is not the right kind of place for the U.S. to be on what is shaping up to be the biggest humanitarian disaster of this century and which is promising to have the largest loss of life and bloodiest conflict the Middle East has seen,"" Sheikh said. ""But there is no alternative. It is all we have, so now have to go through it and hope for something after Geneva. I think it is a misreading of the situation and the whole region. I'm not sure they can stand many more months of this while the ground churns,"" Sheikh said. Syria's ghost homes, ravaged by war . Moreover, there is no agreement in terms of what the parameters of the Geneva talks are. The United States, United Nations and other Western and Arab countries want talks on a transitional government. The Syrian regime, Russia and Iran - who won't be there as a participant but with thousands of fighters on the ground helping the regime will be the elephant in the room - believe Geneva is about fighting the growing Islamic insurgency and rehabilitating al-Assad. With al Qaeda forces continuing to capture territory and even checkpoints on the border with Turkey, narrative of al-Assad as savior is stronger. Even as Washington is turning up the pressure on the opposition to join the talks, the administration is significantly lowering expectations. U.S. officials concede merely getting the opposition and the regime in the room would be a success. ""When we first conceptualized the conference, we believed that we would be able to help form a transitional government and that would be that,"" one senior State Department official acknowledged. ""But we understand achieving political progress is more challenging eight months later."" The first direct talks between the two sides after three years of conflict would be a milestone. To jumpstart negotiations over a political transition, Kerry said he and Lavrov are seeking confidence-building measures, including possible local ceasefires, access for delivery of humanitarian aid and exchange of prisoners. Agreement on these issues would also be no small feat. With progress toward a transitional government highly unlikely, the conference will now focus as much on the humanitarian crisis as it will on discussions about Syria's political future. ""The humanitarian situation has taken on a greater importance. It is an enormous crisis and it is appropriate to focus on that,"" another senior U.S. official said. ""We still have a desire to see a transitional government and nobody is giving up with that. But we are also thinking about what our other objectives are,"" the official said. 81 days captive in Syria . Having accepted the fact that Geneva is not likely be a turning point for the conflict, the administration now says it hopes Geneva will be the beginning of a ""process."" But there is wide trepidation among the Syrian opposition about a process that is open-ended and fails to stop the violence and suffering. ""Nothing will happen overnight but it can't be indefinite, Shahbandar said. ""The regime will drag this process on while it continues to bomb cities and increase its starvation campaign."" In addition, any future effort to find a political solution to the Syrian conflict must focus more on broadening the participation of that process to include more Syrians with influence on the ground. ""The biggest failure of Geneva is that the regime and opposition can't turn the corner. They can't because they don't represent the majority of Syrians,"" Sheikh said. Revolutionary councils inside Syria, the backbone of the civil resistance, have been providing services to the people and are increasingly becoming the de-facto representation of the Syrian opposition. But those doing the work on the ground, whether it be political or fighting, are not involved in the political process under way. He lost his leg in war and now helps others . Sheikh, who meets frequently with a cross section of Syrians said that with all of its planning for a post al-Assad Syria, the international community has yet to help build an indigenous opposition in a meaningful way. ""Alawites, Christians, tribal leaders, rebel commanders and business associations all need to be brought in and they aren't,"" Sheikh said. ""If I can do that in a little old think tank, how come the international community hasn't been able to support that?"" Damascus softens its stance as next Geneva talks near .","Assad has no reason to think he can't shoot his way out of crisis, Labott says .

"Interpol has issued a global security alert, asking its member nations to help determine whether a rash of brazen prison escapes recently are linked. Over the past month, prison breaks have taken place in nine Interpol member nations, the global police organization said in an alert this weekend. ""With suspected Al Qaeda involvement in several of the breakouts, which led to the escape of hundreds of terrorists and other criminals, the INTERPOL alert requests the Organization's 190 member countries' assistance in order to determine whether any of these recent events are coordinated or linked,"" the group said in the statement Saturday. Opinion: What's behind timing of terror threat . Several high-profile escapes have garnered headlines in recent weeks: . -- On July 23, an al Qaeda group claimed responsibility for attacks on two Iraqi prisons that a lawmaker said freed more than 500 inmates, including some senior members of the group. Militants used suicide bombers with mortars, rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns to attack prisons as inmates inside rioted and set fires. Militant group claims responsibility for Iraq prison attacks . -- On July 26, about 1,200 inmates spilled out of a prison in Benghazi, Libya. -- And on July 30, Taliban gunmen wearing police uniforms attacked the largest jail in a northern Pakistani province, allowing about 200 inmates to escape, authorities said. About 200 inmates escape in Pakistan Taliban attack on prison . Interpol's alert comes as the United States closes 22 embassies and consulates abroad amid fears that al Qaeda may launch attacks in the Middle East, North Africa and beyond. ""Current information suggests that (al Qaeda) and affiliated organizations continue to plan terrorist attacks both in the region and beyond, and that they may focus efforts to conduct attacks in the period between now and the end of August,"" a U.S. State Department travel alert read. Interpol noted that August has been a fervent month for attacks. ""August is the anniversary of violent terrorist incidents in Mumbai, India, and Gluboky, Russia, as well as in Jakarta, Indonesia,"" the Interpol alert states. This month also marks the 15th anniversary of the U.S. Embassy bombings in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, in which more than 200 mostly African citizens were killed and 4,000 others injured, Interpol said.","Interpol wants member countries to help determine whether prison breaks are linked .

"Apple's announcement on Thursday that it would be introducing a new iPad textbook experience and iBooks authoring tool presents huge opportunities for technology in classrooms. The company is selling textbooks from McGraw-Hill, Pearson and Houghton Mifflin at a price comparable to print versions, and it's presented an unprecedented opportunity for teachers to compile their own materials. But Apple has a long way to go -- and logistical hurdles to clear in tens of thousands of schools -- before it dominates K-12 classrooms the way it has done the music industry. Instructional Technology Resource Teacher Jenny Grabiec recently purchased iPads for two of the ESL classrooms in her 160-school district using federal funds allocated for students with limited English proficiency. Getting approval for the actual purchase was fairly easy. She sent a written request to the district CIO, and he approved it. But it took five months to get the iPads up and running after they arrived. In order to download new apps, she needed to get the Apple volume purchase program approved as a vendor by the budget group. But who would explain to the budget committee the process of paying with an Apple ID? Who would be responsible for downloading the volume-purchased apps? Could the students use them outside of their hour-long ESL class? The list of logistical issues went on. ""Because nobody in our district had done it before, it took a long time,"" Grabiec says. Becoming the next big thing . By Apple's count, 1.5 million iPads are being used by schools. But there are 55.5 million students enrolled in more than 130,000 U.S. schools. No matter how you slice it, the iPad is not a mainstream phenomenon in K-12. Nor is there any guarantee it will become so. One-to-one initiatives for laptops have been pushing forward for years without mainstream adoption. Maine, for instance, gave 33,000 middle school students and 3,000 teachers personal laptops as early as 2002. But in 2009, a survey by the National Center for Education Statistics found that while 99% of public school teachers have some access to computers, just 29% of public school teachers use them during instructional time ""often."" Just 3% of schools in a 2010 survey by the FCC said they have a one-to-one computer ratio. iPads do have a couple of advantages over one-to-one laptop initiatives. Grabiec points out that the iPads' batteries last longer than the laptops she oversees in other classrooms. They also have been less expensive to maintain than the computers — not a single one has been damaged — and don't work as stand-ins for desktop computers, but as cameras, GPS devices and video cameras. ""With a laptop you were stuck with consuming content,"" says Timothy Smith, who works as an Instructional Technology Specialist in the same district as Grabiec. ""But with the iPad you're taking videos and looking at ideas in a new way."" Textbook availability . Even though Apple's first iPad textbooks will sell for $15 or less, they won't be any less expensive for schools than paper books. Vineet Madan, head McGraw-Hill Higher Education eLabs, tells Mashable that iBooks will be sold to schools rather than directly to students, but that schools will grant students access to those books through their personal IDs. In other words, even if a school reuses iPads, it won't be able to reuse books. The books will be kept on individual students' iTunes accounts. Schools reuse the same paper book for about five years, and those books usually cost about $75. Because a new book will be purchased every year, the iBook version still costs $75 for five years. Relying on iBooks as textbooks isn't a feasible option for most public schools at the moment because Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, McGraw-Hill and Pearson have each dedicated just a small number of titles each. Madan puts the typical cycle for textbook approval in most states at about five years. Unless the school happens to be using one of the selected titles, it can't use iBooks yet. Most other options for digital textbooks that can be read on an iPad --including Coursesmart, Kno, Chegg and Inkling — focus on books for higher education. Unless major publishers decide to add more of their titles to iBooks, it won't be a feasible default reader in most schools. Madan says that McGraw has already committed to adding five additional titles before September, but it will commit to additional titles based on uptake. Broadband and red tape . In a FTC 2010 survey of the schools in its program for discounted telecommunications, almost 80% said their Internet connections don't fully meet their current needs. ""It's not atypical to see one classroom of students on connected devices bring down a network,"" Madan says. Before schools introduce connected devices, many of them will need to introduce better Internet connections. And that's just one logistical issue. Schools and districts will likely have a longer list specific to their circumstances. Consider the situation that Smith, who recently helped put an iPad in the hands of every administrator in his district, faces when he thinks about introducing iPads district-wide: . Some types of funding, like the one used to buy iPads for the ESL classrooms, can't be used for anything already being paid for by the school district. If the district bought iPads for some students, in other words, it would be cutting off other sources of funding. It's a puzzle. Bringing iPads to the mainstream . Many schools already use iPads in their courses. Policies that allow students to bring their own devices to school might make make this more common. According to a 2011 Pearson Foundation survey, 70% percent of college students and college-bound high school seniors are interested in owning a tablet device, and 20% expect to purchase a tablet within the next six months. The inevitable price decline on the iPad could also make iPads a more mainstream conduit for educational material. ""This is a change in how school districts think,"" Smith says, ""and in a larger school district, that can take some time."" See the original article on Mashable.com .","Apple has a long way to go before it dominates K-12 classrooms .

How it could deliver: . 1. You're a creature of habit. You want the same coffee at the same time every day? No problem. 2. Sheer convenience.

You get to skip the annoyances of coffee shop culture, from the person listening to music out loud to the obnoxious cell phone talker to the chair hogger. 4. You can place a big order for you and your buddies without worrying about having enough hands to get it back safely. How it could fail to deliver: . 1. You lose the coffee shop culture: the free WiFi, the cute barista, the quirky name spelling on the cup. Oh, and the free (usually) clean bathrooms. 2. With an added service often comes an added cost, not to mention a gratuity. Better beef up that coffee fund. 3. Many of Starbucks' drinks are temperature-sensitive. With time for delivery, an iced drink could arrive watered down, and a hot one could arrive lukewarm. 4. Mistakes happen. But if the wrong drink arrives, it's not just a matter of pushing it back across the counter; it's a matter of calling out for another delivery.

"Chinese authorities on Friday blocked access inside the country to the English and Chinese websites of The New York Times after they published an article reporting that family members of Premier Wen Jiabao had amassed a fortune worth billions of dollars. Citing corporate and regulatory records, The Times said it had pieced together evidence showing that Wen's relatives have controlled assets worth at least $2.7 billion, often hiding their names ""behind layers of partnerships and investment vehicles involving friends, work colleagues and business partners."" China reacted angrily to the report, preventing people inside the country from visiting the two Times websites or searching for the terms ""New York Times"" and ""Wen Jiabao"" on popular social media platforms. Big Brother still watching: Internet censorship on the up . ""It's trying to blacken China's image and has ulterior motives,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said in a response to a question about the article, which mentioned Wen's son, daughter, younger brother and brother-in-law as being among those who had grown rich during Wen's time in power. Asked about the decision to block the websites, Hong replied: ""China regulates the Internet in accordance with laws and regulations."" The Chinese government tries aggressively to control the flow information inside its borders about sensitive topics like unrest in Tibetan areas and criticism of senior officials. It strictly manages the output of domestic news media outlets and has a history of shutting off access to international news websites. Chinese authorities have blacked out the broadcast signal for international television stations like CNN and the BBC when they have aired sensitive reports about the country. The Times story about Wen's family's wealth comes at a particularly delicate time for the ruling Communist Party, only a matter of weeks before the start of the 18th Party Congress, at which the country's next set of top leaders will be announced. Opinion: New 'democracies' failing if speech isn't free . Authorities have stepped up security in Beijing, where the congress, part of a once-in-a-decade leadership transition, will take place. This transfer of power has already been complicated by the dramatic and damaging scandal involving the former high-flying official Bo Xilai and his inner circle. In a country where official corruption is widespread, the top leadership is particularly sensitive to suggestions that its members or those close to them have become unusually wealthy. The growing divide between rich and poor after two decades of torrid economic growth has added to that defensiveness. The Times article on the wealth of Wen's relatives comes four months after Bloomberg News reported that the extended family of Vice President Xi Jinping, the presumptive next top leader of China, had accumulated business interests worth hundreds of millions of dollars during his rise up the Communist Party ladder. Chinese authorities cut off access to the Bloomberg News website following publication of the article, which was also based on public documents. The blocking of the Times websites Friday also takes place four months after the introduction of the Chinese-language site, which the company said at the time was ""intended to draw readers from the country's growing middle class"" through a mixture of reporting by Chinese journalists and Times articles translated from English. The Times cited a company spokeswoman as expressing disappointment Friday that web access had been cut off. ""We hope that full access is restored shortly, and we will ask the Chinese authorities to ensure that our readers in China can continue to enjoy New York Times journalism,"" said Eileen Murphy, according to The Times. ""We will continue to report and translate stories applying the same journalistic standards that are upheld across The New York Times.""

"Two men have been arrested in connection with terror-related activities, a U.S. attorney in Texas said Wednesday. Michael Todd Wolfe, 23, of Austin, was arrested Tuesday at  George H.W. Bush Houston Intercontinental Airport just before he boarded a flight to Europe, authorities said in a statement. Wolfe is charged ""with attempting to provide material support to terrorists."" He ""planned to travel to the Middle East to provide his services to radical groups engaged in armed conflict in Syria,"" according to a complaint. On February 2, an undercover agent met with Wolfe and his wife and they watched a YouTube video about foreign fighters in Syria, officials say. Wolfe allegedly discussed the activities of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), the Sunni militant group fighting in Syria and staging an offensive against Iraq. ""While watching the video, Wolfe occasionally stopped the video to explain the current allegiances of the various groups fighting in Syria. They include ISIS, al Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra, the Free Syria Army, and Dawla,"" a complaint said. Rahatul Ashikim Khan, 23, of Round Rock, was arrested in a separate case at his home and charged with ""conspiring to provide material support to terrorists."" A complaint said Khan ""conspired with others to recruit persons to travel overseas to support terrorist activities including committing violent jihad"" during a period from early 2011 to January 2012.

"The United States plans to send small arms, ammunition and potentially anti-tank weapons to Syria's rebels, two officials familiar with the matter told CNN on Friday. President Barack Obama's administration has declined to provide details about increased military assistance for the rebels following its announcement Thursday that Syria crossed a ""red line"" with its use of chemical weapons. Ben Rhodes, a U.S. deputy national security adviser, told reporters that Washington will ""increase the size and scope of the assistance."" When pushed for more details, Rhodes said: ""I can't give you a specific timeline or itemized list of what that assistance is."" The weapons will be provided by the CIA, the officials told CNN's chief White House correspondent Jessica Yellin. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity surrounding the issue. The U.S. announcement set off a series of claims and counterclaims in Syria and world capitals over the conflict that has claimed more than 90,000 lives with no sign of progress toward a political solution. Britain backed the U.S. change in position, but Syria and its allies in Russia quickly sought to cast its integrity into doubt. The Syrian foreign ministry accused Washington of releasing ""a statement full of lies regarding the use of chemical weapons in Syria,"" according to a statement released on state TV. And a government statement carried by the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency accused the United States of using ""flagrant tricks to come up with any possible means to justify the decision of President Barack Obama to arm the Syrian opposition."" An aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin labeled as ""unconvincing"" the U.S. evidence of chemical weapons use by Syria. However, British Foreign Secretary William Hague backed the U.S. government's assessment and called for a coordinated response from the international community. 'Weapons and ammunition' Obama has been criticized at home and abroad for not acting sooner to assist the Syrian opposition, and the declaration that the red line of chemical weapons use had been crossed raised expectations of U.S. arms heading to the rebels. ""What we need, really, is weapons and ammunition, and especially anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles,"" Gen. Salim Idriss of the rebel Free Syrian Army told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Friday. Idriss said he has not been told what type of weapons the United States will provide to the rebel army. Louay Almokdad, political and media coordinator of the rebel Free Syrian Army, told CNN that he expected the United States initially to send ammunition, rather than heavy arms. What complicates any U.S. military support for the opposition is that many of the rebel fighters are militants with pro-al Qaeda sympathies, the same stripe of militants America has battled in Iraq and Afghanistan. They include the al-Nusra Front, a rebel group that the United States says has links to al Qaeda. The rebels promised U.S. and European officials that any military weaponry they get won't end up with extremists among the anti-government forces, Almokdad said. The officials told CNN that beyond small arms and ammunition, anti-tank weapons were also under consideration. They did not spell out what was being given to rebels, but small arms can include such items as rocket-propelled grenades, small rockets, mortars and mines as well as guns. Anti-aircraft weapons were considered less likely, and Rhodes made clear Friday that Obama has ruled out sending any U.S. troops to Syria. ""The one option that we've basically taken off the table is boots on the ground,"" Rhodes said, adding that Obama has made the final decision on the step that ""dramatically increases assistance to"" rebel forces. 'Convincing' evidence . Presidential aide Yuri Ushakov told reporters the United States had shown Russian officials data and information on Syria's use of chemical weapons, Russia's state-run news agency RIA Novosti reported Friday. ""What we saw does not look convincing to us,"" Ushakov was quoted as saying. In a telephone call with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said arming the rebels ""would lead to an escalation in the region, since the U.S. accusations that Damascus has used chemical weapons are not rooted in reliable facts,"" according to a statement released by the Russian Foreign Ministry. Washington and Moscow have been deeply divided over how to end the bloodshed in Syria, and the issue is expected to top the agenda when Obama and Putin meet for one-on-on talks Monday at the start of G8 summit in the UK. ""This is a fluid situation. So it is necessary for us to consult with leaders of the G8 about the types of support that we are providing for the opposition,"" Rhodes said. Asked about Russia's questioning of U.S. evidence that Syria forces used chemical weapons multiple times, killing between 100 to 150 people, Rhodes said the information provided to Putin's government included samples of sarin gas and other ""convincing"" evidence. That evidence, according to Rhodes, includes intelligence reports, eyewitness accounts and ""physiological samples"" of the nerve agent sarin. No single piece of intelligence led to the conclusion that the Syrian regime had used chemical weapons, said a senior administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The official was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. The finding, according to the official, was a result of looking at a number of instances of suspected use, seeing similar evidence and patterns of usage and coming to the conclusion chemical weapons had been used. Rhodes acknowledged the differences that remain between the United States and Russia on the Syrian crisis. The administration believes al-Assad's forces have used saran gas at least eight times in the more than two year conflict, said a U.S. Senate sourced briefed on the matter. A boost in support by the United States for the rebels could put at risk the gains made by Syrian forces in recent days, especially in central and northern Syria, with the help of Hezbollah fighters from Iran. In Damascus, an al-Assad loyalist who spoke to CNN's Frederik Pleitgen said he believes the United States is ""inventing stories"" about the government's use of chemical weapons ""because our army is winning."" McCain: Rebels losing fight . The White House announcement comes at a critical time for the Syrian opposition, which has suffered a series of significant losses in recent weeks. Those losses have coincided in large part with the arrival of thousands of Hezbollah Shiite fighters, backed by Lebanon and Iran, to reinforce al-Assad's forces battling the mainly Sunni uprising. After months of gaining ground, the rebels this month lost Qusayr -- one of their strongholds near the Lebanese border -- which was considered essential for the rebels' supply route. Until now, the United States has limited its aid to rebels, providing communications equipment, medical supplies and food. Obama signed off on a new package of non-lethal aid in April. That assistance was expected to include body armor, night-vision goggles and other military equipment. Sen. John McCain, who has repeatedly pushed the Obama administration to step up its support for the rebels, told CNN on Friday that they need anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons. Asked whether the rebels were losing the fight, the Arizona Republican said: ""Absolutely, there's no doubt about it."" He also called for taking out al-Assad's air assets to create a safe zone for the Syrian opposition. ""I know that we have the military capability to impose a 'no-fly' zone, to crater their runways and their fixed installations where fuel and parts are, and establish a 'no-fly' zone with Patriot missiles,"" McCain said. ""And if we can't do that, then the question ought to be asked to the American taxpayer -- to the Pentagon, 'What in the world are we wasting tens of billions of dollars for defense for if we can't even take care of this situation?'"" McCain said. Rhodes, however, indicated that a ""no-fly"" zone was unlikely, saying it would be ""dramatically more difficult and dangerous and costly"" to enforce one in Syria compared to the one NATO forces imposed with U.S. backing during Libya's civil war. Libyan rebels had control of large portions of the country, unlike the Syrian rebels, he noted, and the Libyan military had fewer air-defense systems. He added that a ""no-fly"" zone ""is not a silver bullet."" U.S. defense officials are not reviewing any new or updated options for a no-fly zone, two Pentagon sources said. Even if U.S. planes monitored a no-fly zone along the Syrian-Jordanian border, the Syrian regime could attack targets in southern Syria using long range artillery or Scud missiles, a senior Pentagon official said. Syria's stockpile . Syria has long maintained that rebels, not government forces, are behind the use of chemical weapons. It also went to the United Nations with its claims, but al-Assad would not allow U.N. inspectors into the country to try to verify the claims. Analysts believe the Syrian government may have one of the largest stockpiles of chemical weapons in the world. Specifically, the supply is believed to include sarin, mustard and VX gases, which are banned under international law. Syria has denied the allegation. Sarin gas can be hard to detect because it is colorless, odorless and tasteless. It can cause severe injuries -- including blurred vision, convulsions, paralysis and death -- to those exposed to it . In recent months, reports have repeatedly surfaced that Syrian forces have moved some of the chemical weapons inventories, possibly because of deteriorating security in the country, raising fears the stockpile could fall into the hands of al Qaeda-linked groups working with the opposition should al-Assad's government fall. U.S. officials have been closely monitoring Syria's chemical weapons stockpiles and are certain they remain in the control of al-Assad's regime, Rhodes said, adding that it would be too dangerous to destroy the chemical weapons stockpiles from afar. As recently as last week, the French foreign minister said sarin gas had been used several times in the Syrian civil war, citing results from test samples in France's possession. In early May, the head of the U.N. Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria said that evidence points to the use of sarin by Syrian rebel forces. But the commission later issued a news release saying it ""has not reached conclusive findings as to the use of chemical weapons in Syria by any parties to the conflict.""","President Barack Obama will meet with Russia's president on Monday .

"On guns, President Obama needs a ""Plan B."" The president himself recognizes that the votes probably aren't there to pass any significant gun legislation through Congress. In his State of the Union address, he was reduced to pleading with Congress to allow a vote at all, never mind actually enact anything. Even if Congress were seized by a sudden change of heart, the measures the president has proposed seem unlikely to achieve much. Universal background checks would be a baby step forward. But until state governments join background checks to some effective system of gun licensing, the checks are very easily evaded. A felon or domestic batterer or disturbed person need only find a person with a clean background to buy a weapon for him. But here are two things that can make a real difference -- without a vote in Congress. First: The president can direct the surgeon general to compile a scientific study of the health effect of individual gun ownership. Photos: Coming to grips with guns . The basis of the whole gun debate in the United States is the belief by millions of Americans that they need a firearm in the home to protect themselves from criminals. Testifying to Congress last month, a gun advocate named Gayle Trotter presented a vivid image of how guns might be used. ""An assault weapon in the hands of a young woman defending her babies in her home becomes a defense weapon, and the peace of mind that a woman has as she's facing three, four, five violent attackers, intruders in her home, with her children screaming in the background, the peace of mind that she has knowing that she has a scary-looking gun gives her more courage when she's fighting hardened, violent criminals."" Thrilling. Also wholly imaginary. Such Rambo-like defenses of home and hearth do not happen in real life, unless the home also happens to contain a meth lab. (The oft-cited statistic that gun owners draw in self-defense 2.5 million times a year is a classic of bad social science.) Incidents like these, however, do happen -- and tragically often: . ""A fourteen year-old girl jumped out of the closet and shouted 'Boo' when her parents came home in the middle of the night. Taking her for an intruder, her father shot and killed her. Her last words were 'I love you, Daddy.' "" That true story, reported in the Boston Globe in 1994, appears on page 70 of the classic study ""Private Guns, Public Health"" by David Hemenway, director of Harvard's Injury Control Research Center. It's just one of thousands of similar incidents in the United States every year. Hemenway again: ""Between 1990 and 2000, an annual average of 320 children zero to fourteen either committed suicide with guns or were accidentally killed by guns."" American children are much more likely to suffer these tragedies than children in other countries. States with more guns suffer more than states in which guns are less common. Complete coverage: Gun Debate . Claims that homeowners often use guns for legitimate self-defense dwindle away on close examination. What the gun owner claims as self-defense often looks, on closer examination, more like trigger-happy recklessness. Here's another case, as reported by Hemenway. ""Two women, aged thirty-four and forty, were driving home from work when one cut the other off on a congested highway. Their rage escalated as traffic crawled for miles and the women flashed their headlights and hit their brakes. Both vehicles left the interstate, heading for home. At the first traffic light, one woman left her car and approached the other, perhaps to end the confrontation. The woman in the car shot the approaching woman in the face, killing her."" Self-defense? Maybe. But the shooter herself wasn't so sure. She was recorded weeping, ""Oh, my God, I shot her. Oh, my God, I can't believe I shot her. Oh, my God, I can't believe she's dying."" As for guns in the home, Hemenway reports studies find that ""(G)uns are used far more often in the home to intimidate and frighten intimates than to protect against intruders."" These are facts about guns that are well-known to the social scientists who study gun injury but poorly understood by the general public. Read more: Obama in Chicago to talk guns . Fifty years ago, Americans contended with similar public ignorance -- and similar industry misinformation -- about the hazards of cigarette smoking. The argument was settled by the famous surgeon general's report of 1964. Congress in the mid-1990s forbade the federal government to fund its own research into the health risks presented by guns. By now, however, enough research has been done by privately funded scholars that the surgeon general could write a report based on existing material. Such a report would surely reach the conclusion that a gun in the home greatly elevates risks of suicide, lethal accident and fatal domestic violence. The first step to changing gun policy is to change public attitudes about guns, as Americans previously changed their attitudes about tobacco and drunken driving. The surgeon general can lead that attitude change with more authority than any other public official. The second step that might be taken -- again without the need for any congressional vote -- is for the Senate to convene hearings into the practices of the gun industry analogous to those it convened into the tobacco industry in the 1990s. Read more: Gun focus shifts from ban to checks and trafficking . So many gun accidents occur because guns almost never indicate whether a bullet is present in the chamber. A gun owner might remove the gun's magazine and believe the gun unloaded, when in fact it still contains one potentially deadly shot. Why not require guns to be equipped with indicator lights? Why not require that guns be designed so that they will not fire if dropped? We have safety standards for every consumer product, from children's cribs to lawnmowers, except for the most dangerous consumer product of them all. Not only that, Congress has actually immunized makers of that product against harms inflicted by unsafe design. Gun makers often design their weapons in ways that present no benefit for lawful users but that greatly assist criminals. They don't coordinate the issuance of serial numbers so that each gun can be identified with certainty. They stamp serial numbers in places where they can be effaced. They reject police requests to etch barrels to uniquely mark each cartridge fired by a particular gun. They sell bullets that can pierce police armor. They will not include trigger locks and other child-proofing devices as standard equipment. They ignore new technology that would render guns inoperable by anyone except their approved purchaser. Why? Why? And why? U.S. gunmakers have never been required to answer these questions. But one Senate subcommittee chairman with subpoena powers could cast much needed light on an industry whose record makes the tobacco industry look a paragon of transparency and accountability in comparison. There's a gun agenda that need not depend on politics and that will not snatch a single weapon from any owner, whether law-abiding or not. If Congress stalls on the president's ambitious legislative schemes, the president should fall back on this Plan B to publicize what guns really do to those who carry them -- and what gunmakers do to their customers.","David Frum: Obama may not have votes for gun legislation to pass .

"A French prosecutor dropped an investigation Tuesday into former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn's connection to a possible gang rape in Washington. The young Belgian woman whose testimony was the basis for the inquiry has withdrawn her previous statement and said she will not press charges, a statement from the Lille prosecutor's office said. Strauss-Kahn: A reputation battered by sex allegations . This meant the inquiry had no grounds to continue, the statement said. Strauss-Kahn remains under investigation over allegations that he participated in a prostitution ring, in what is known in France as the ""Carlton affair."" He has denied wrongdoing and has not been convicted of a crime. Police investigating the alleged prostitution ring referred the Washington incident, which they believed could qualify as gang rape, to the Lille prosecutor earlier this year after hearing the testimony of the Belgian woman. But the prosecutor's office said Tuesday that the Belgian woman's lawyer had stated in August that his client did not want to give any judicial statement on this matter. Can France handle truth on sex lives of rich and powerful? The woman also wrote a letter to the prosecutor in which she said she had been consenting, and that she would not press charges. She had not filed a complaint when she was questioned by French and Belgian investigators late last year. ""Given all these elements, the offense of rape could not be made, and the Lille prosecution decided to proceed no further with the case, on the ground of 'no offense',"" the statement from the prosecutor's office said. The former IMF chief hit the headlines in the United States last year over a separate case involving attempted rape allegations in New York. The judge dismissed all the charges against him after the witness's credibility was thrown into doubt.","Strauss-Kahn remains under investigation in connection with an alleged prostitution ring .

"Protesters pushed their way past police in rowdy scenes as elite members of Hong Kong's Election Committee decided the city-state's next chief executive. They chose Leung Chun-ying, known as CY Leung, a British-educated chartered surveyor and one of two candidates who were backed by Beijing. Leung beat his nearest rival Henry Tang by a wide margin, after an uncharacteristically dirty campaign which exposed extramarital affairs and allegations of bribery. Leung won 689 of the votes, compared to Tang's 285. A third candidate, Democratic Party leader Albert Ho won just 76. While most of the mudslinging during the campaign was aimed at Tang, Leung ran into his own trouble. He is currently under investigation for a conflict of interest case involving a construction project when he was in government office. Race for Hong Kong's top job . There are also allegations of ""black money"" -- that his campaign had been in contact with organized crime figures. He also is suspected of being a closet communist, and is thought to hold hardline views on public order and press freedom. According to his website, Leung attended primary school in Hong Kong but left to study Estate Management at Bristol Polytechnic in the United Kingdom. He walked 55 minutes each way to college ""in the English weather,"" it says, and worked in a Chinese takeaway shop to help cover expenses. On returning to Hong Kong in the late 1970s, Leung worked for real estate consulting firm Jones Lang Wootton, before becoming the youngest partner in the firm's 200-year history, the website says. He later opened his own firm, CY Leung & Co. and became involved in Hong Kong's administration through his election to the Executive Committee of the Basic Law Consultative Committee. He was appointed to the Executive Council of Hong Kong in 1997 and has convened it since. As election members cast their votes, hundreds of demonstrators from varying student and activists groups jostled outside calling for a say in who leads the city-state. Students waved banners saying ""If there's no revolt, there's no change,"" as others yelled slogans through loudspeakers lost in the din of protests. Hong Kong's population of seven million people isn't asked to vote for the chief executive. The decision is made by the 1,200 members of the Election Committee, a group of people selected from pro-business and pro-establishment circles. While China doesn't overtly decide who leads the Special Administrative Region, it does have favored candidates and says that the outcome should be ""acceptable"" to the people of Hong Kong.

"(CNN) -- How about a world where we have murderers but no murders? The police still chase down criminals who commit murder, we have trials, juries who judge, and justice is handed out . . . but no one dies. With many forms of cybercrime and hacking, we can just decide, as a society, to take away much of the damage before it happens. Imagine if the hackers had stolen intimate pictures from Jennifer Lawrence, and we all just agreed that, ""She didn't want us to see these pictures, so we're not going to look."" We don't have a right to her body. If you were over at Jennifer's house, and she left the room to get you a shortbread cookie and cup of decaffeinated tea (this is my fantasy), you wouldn't take that opportunity to search for nude pictures on her computer. If she wanted to change her shirt before you went out to see Dylan together (still my fantasy), and she asked you to turn her back while she did that, even if you were a bit tempted to peek, you wouldn't. You're a good person and you would respect her wishes. If you were visiting Amy Pascal, and she left the room to get . . . um, let's say a nice fig-filled cookie and some hot chocolate, I don't think you would open up her computer and read her company emails to see if you could find something that you could use against her. You just wouldn't do that. I don't even want to know what people are saying behind my back about me, let alone about someone else. If you follow that same morality, if you simply think that people have a right to privacy and that you don't want to see what people don't want you to see, well, there would still be hacking crimes ... but the victims would suffer less. I've been seriously blackmailed. I've had all the information on my computer fall into the criminal hands and the criminal ask for money to not publish that information. Yup, there were sex pictures of me and somehow my criminal thought that me naked was as valuable as Jennifer Lawrence naked. My criminal was a f-----g idiot. There was nothing on my drive that would have really done any damage to my career. It really wouldn't have even embarrassed me that much, but I was still freaked by a bad guy looking at my stuff. My criminal was busted and stopped and the information never got out, but it was still yucky. Jennifer Lawrence and Sony are all going to feel violated and the crime is still real, but we, as a society, can make much of the damage go away. We don't need reporters to team up with the criminals to help them do the damage. The crime is newsworthy, but not the content. It is not our right to see pictures and emails that the owners didn't want us to see. We have no right to stolen goods. Even if someone else stole it first, stealing is still wrong. We can't stop any damage a murder causes just by not reporting it and not looking, but we can do that with hacking. Let's do that. If someone doesn't want us to see something, let's not look. Let's not help criminals. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Penn Jillette.","Penn Jillette: Hacking is a crime that is enabled when we invade others' privacy .

"U.S. authorities arrested an American man returning from overseas who they say is a sympathizer of the terrorist group ISIS. Donald Ray Morgan was arrested on August 2 on arrival at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport from Frankfurt, Germany, according to federal court documents. A federal grand jury in North Carolina charged him with illegal weapons possession, and prosecutors say he was involved in weapons trafficking in violation of his probation for a previous felony conviction, the court documents show. The court documents make no mention of the ISIS connection, but U.S. officials say that part of what drew their attention is Morgan's online activities, making Twitter postings in support of the terrorist group. Morgan is not thought to be involved in any active plots inside the U.S. or elsewhere and instead may be more of an ""aspirational"" supporter of ISIS. Still, with the rise of ISIS, and more than 100 Americans believed to have traveled to Syria to fight in the ongoing civil war, the FBI is on alert for returning Americans who may be associated with groups fighting there. The New York Daily News reported Sunday night that at his first appearance in court on August 4, prosecutors opposed bail, citing fears that he was possibly involved with ISIS, which is fighting to establish an Islamic extremist state in parts of Syria and Iraq. The group calls itself the Islamic State but formerly was known as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. The Daily News report cited officials alleging that Morgan used the moniker Abu Omar al Amreeki to publish tweets in support of ISIS while he spent time in Lebanon. The newspaper quoted federal prosecutor Nadia Moore as saying in court:  ""It's possible that he traffics in guns to people in this organization (ISIS)."" Chief Magistrate Judge Steven Gold denied bond based on the government's argument, saying the tweets had ""clearly implied to me that he is trying to go to Syria or Iraq,"" according to the Daily News. A public defender assigned to represent Morgan said there was no evidence Morgan tried to support ISIS, the Daily News reported. The public defender didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from CNN late Sunday.

"(CNN)If marrying design and engineering is a fine art, then who better for the job than sailing's answer to ""David Hockney with an iPad?"" Like Hockney, this is man whose canvas is a tablet. His subject? Ultra-slick, quick racing boats. Dirk Kramers, who counts Ted Turner among his former employers, has been tasked with designing a vessel capable of winning the 2017 America's Cup -- sailing's most prestigious race. His new boss is a man who knows a thing or two about winning, multiple Olympic champion Ben Ainslie. The knight of the realm is behind a bold bid to bring the Auld Mug to British shores for the first time. The competition is still two years away but at the temporary home of Ben Ainslie Racing HQ on an industrial estate just outside Portsmouth, they are plotting victory. ""Everyone wants to see the champagne flying at the finish -- that's the sound bites and visual bites that people live for,"" Kramers told CNN. ""But the main chapters of this are being written now. The America's Cup is being won now."" BAR's temporary base -- they will relocate to a bigger headquarters next May on Portsmouth's waterfront -- gives little indication of the expertise at work with its white, spartan interior. Inside there are decades worth of experience among the 55-strong workforce, which will rise to near 100 by the time of the Cup. Money and cutting-edge technology are key to this operation but, for Kramers, who modestly downplays himself as ""the old guy on the team"", the most valuable ingredient is far more simplistic. ""Most of the time it's not the biggest spender that wins,"" says the American. ""The most expensive commodity is time. You're always learning and it's the person that learns the most that will have the fastest boat."" With every minute precious in the countdown to the big race, no wonder the pictorial greeting on the first flight of stairs from the entrance for any visitor to Team HQ is a quote from Muhammad Ali: ""Don't count the days, make the days count."" ""In terms of setting structure and design philosophy, that happens now,"" says Ainslie as he reflects on the process of filling key management roles before steadily expanding the sailing, design and on-shore workforce . ""If we get this bit wrong, we'll never recover. And unfortunately until we're on the start line, we won't know for sure how we've done."" Ainslie's first call was to Andy Claughton, the team's technical director. In Formula One terms, he is like an Adrian Newey, who has since signed up to the BAR project, to a Sebastian Vettel during their time together at Red Bull. Claughton competed in the same era as Ainslie's coach Sid Howlett and has been involved in America's Cup racing since 1983. He and Ainslie got to know each other during the 2007 America's Cup when Ainslie was part of the Team New Zealand set-up. A keen engineer for as long as he can remember, Claughton likens the project to, ""a Mecano set -- you have to make sure you pick all the right bits."" But, because of the sheer numbers involved, he admits ""it's like playing rugby with 100 players."" Fortunately for Claughton, it's not a case of starting from scratch. ""The thing is that someone's always done something similar before so there are rules of thumb,"" he explains. ""A lot of projects aren't rocket science. We're not going to invent some new technology that will win us the Cup. What we will do is reassemble existing technology that can help us."" That starts with the simplicity of a Kramers sketch either on paper or more often an iPad, which he started to use to share his ideas more easily with his colleagues. This is then fed into a 3D computer model overseen by Francesco Azevedo. Portugal's Azevedo is one of 11 nationalities currently represented on the design team, which also prides itself on a ""best of British"" approach. A rarity on the team as an America's Cup debutant, the former architect explains: ""I try to model the ideas from everybody and try to make it as a 3D model so everyone can sit around and discuss. ""Everyone feeds it into me and I try to give everyone feedback because sometimes ideas clash and you cannot physically fit them together so I try to come up with solutions and present solutions to everybody else and say 'this idea didn't really work - what about this?'"" How versatile the team can be with their design is curtailed by the America's Cup rule book. For example, it tells you the boat must have two hulls a certain length apart and be of a certain length and width. ""Under the rules, it quickly becomes clearer in a picture what the boat looks like,"" adds Claughton. ""To the naked eye, all the boats will look similar. The disparity will come as these boats are fantastically difficult to sail. There's lots of opportunity to do things well and badly."" The designers may use a wind tunnel to test a certain part but the computational tools at their disposal are so accurate it is not always required. So once sent through the 3D model, individual parts are sent to an external supplier with the touch of a button and, as Claughton says, ""it turns up in a box at the end of the week."" Deciding how long to spend designing products while also minimizing manufacturing time is a balancing act. The first testing boat (T1) is already out on the water, T2 is expected to be fully operational in May while the eventual boat on which Ainslie and his team will race for the Cup is set to be finalized in design terms by the end of next year's sailing season. ""There is an end point and that's the $64,000 question when that is,"" explains Claughton. ""You're balancing pushing the design time but also the amount of time the guys can spend on the water."" A myriad of different organizations are on board with Ainslie's team from the British Ministry of Defence to big players in aerospace and engineering company Prodrive, which boasts a rich motorsport history. And while the majority of the staff have been picked for their America's Cup pedigree, others have been headhunted from elsewhere. James Roche is the boyfriend of British Olympic skeleton gold medallist Lizzy Yarnold and previously worked at UK Sport and latterly McLaren Applied Technologies. He helped design the sleds that Yarnold and, before her, Amy Williams, drove to Olympic glory. His role at Ben Ainslie Racing is simulation support and the once budding sailor is adamant his skills translate from ice to water. ""It's engineering and optimization and working with athletes with equipment so there are a lot of parallels,"" he says. His job is to work on performance prediction programs and writing code to foresee how the boat will behave and react with sailors and new equipment. But for all the brains and cutting-edge technology behind it, there is no guarantee this $130 million project will ultimately prove successful. ""That's the elephant in the room,"" admits Claughton, though the buzz through the open-plan office suggests a team brimming with confidence that it is currently on the right path. Ultimately, Ainslie is a fiercely determined sailor and he is adamant the team can ""bring back the Cup to Britain"" for the first time in the event's history. Time will tell.","We go inside Ben Ainslie Racing HQ to find out how exactly an America's Cup boat is built .

"Dr. Bassem Youssef, dubbed the ""Jon Stewart"" of Egypt, will return to the late night airwaves Friday, three months after his show ""Albernameg"" was kicked off the air in his home country. Youssef made the announcement via his Twitter account and a YouTube video. The new program, originating in Cairo and airing on MBC at 10 p.m. Fridays, will retain the name of his old program, which was dropped by CBC after Youssef's satire offended supporters of Egyptian Gen. Abdel-Fatah El-Sisi. When CBC terminated ""Albernameg,"" it raised questions about freedom of speech in Egypt under El-Sisi, the country's de facto leader since the ousting of President Mohammed Morsy on July 3. Ironically, Youssef came to prominence with his show's satiric look at politics following the 2011 Arab Spring, and he thrived while Morsy was in charge. Morsy and 14 other defendants are on trial, facing charges of inciting murder at the Presidential Palace in December 2012.

"The contention that President Obama apologized to other nations for American behavior has been mentioned repeatedly by his critics, including Mitt Romney. During his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in August, Romney said, ""I will begin my presidency with the jobs tour. President Obama began his with an apology tour. America, he said, had dictated to other nations. No, Mr. President America has freed other nations from dictators."" At last week's debate that ""President Obama's policies throughout the Middle East began with an apology tour."" Romney made the claim again during the Monday night debate. ""The president began what I have called an apology tour, of going to various nations in the Middle East and criticizing America."" CNN Fact Check: Obama's China tire case . Romney also said the ""reason I call it an apology tour is because you went to the Middle East and you flew to Egypt and to Saudi Arabia and to Turkey and Iraq.  And by the way, you skipped Israel, our closest friend in the region, but you went to the other nations."" Romney said ""in those nations, and on Arabic TV, you said that America had been dismissive and derisive.  You said that on occasion America had dictated to other nations."" Obama said the apologizing claim ""has been probably the biggest whopper that's been told during the course of this campaign."" The facts: . When President Obama began his term, he made a number of speeches in the Middle East and elsewhere -- all designed to forge better ties with Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America. Critics such as Romney have said Obama apologized for past actions in such addresses. Obama did indeed mention past U.S. flaws in speeches. But in those addresses, Obama never uttered an apology for the United States. Those statements were snippets, part of larger and grander narratives about repairing ties, building friendship and working together. Fact Check: Romney, Obama and Iraq . During an address in Strasbourg, France, in April 2009, Obama did utter words Romney referenced in the debate. In that speech, Obama said, ""there have been times where America has shown arrogance and been dismissive, even derisive."" But in the very next sentence, Obama called out the Europeans for an ""anti-Americanism that is at once casual but can also be insidious. Instead of recognizing the good that America so often does in the world, there have been times where Europeans choose to blame America for much of what's bad."" He then goes on to talk about forging ""common solutions to our common problems."" ""America cannot confront the challenges of this century alone, but that Europe cannot confront them without America. So I've come to Europe this week to renew our partnership, one in which America listens and learns from our friends and allies, but where our friends and allies bear their share of the burden. Together, we must forge common solutions to our common problems."" An April 2009 speech before the Turkish parliament praised both the United States and Turkey. It focused on common bonds and threats, such as extremism, the economy, and energy issues. During that speech, he said ""another issue that confronts all democracies as they move to the future is how we deal with the past"" and touches on a major blemish on U.S. history. ""The United States is still working through some of our own darker periods in our history,"" Obama said.  ""Our country still struggles with the legacies of slavery and segregation, the past treatment of Native Americans."" After that statement, Obama segued into a similar stain on Turkey's history -- the massacre of Armenians during World War I, and how both Turks and Armenians should work toward a ""new day."" Fact Check: Al Qaeda core decimated or growing? In June 2009, Obama delivered a major speech in Egypt where he discussed ""a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world, one based on mutual interest and mutual respect."" Citing the""fear and anger"" after 9/11, Obama said that in some cases, ""it led us to act contrary to our traditions and our ideals."" While defending America's reaction to the 9/11 attacks, Obama resolved to fight extremism, support Israel, and back the establishment of a Palestinian state.. Back in December, Michael Cohen, a columnist for Foreign Policy's Election 2012 Channel, called the ""apology tour"" claim ""a lie that has been reiterated so often that it has become conventional wisdom on the right. "" ""The apology canard has been disproven practically as often as it has been made."" As for Israel, it is true that the president hasn't visited the country since his election. But Obama did visit the Jewish state during his 2008 campaign. He went to the Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum and the southern Israeli town of Sderot, the city battered by missiles from Hamas-controlled Gaza. ""If we're going to talk about trips that we've taken -- when I was a candidate for office, first trip I took was to visit our troops,"" Obama said. He had visited Iraq and Afghanistan as a candidate. Fact Check: Comparing costs of Iraq, Libya missions . Conclusion: . Romney's claim is false.

"A Utah death row inmate, convicted of beating a man with a tire jack and puncturing his liver with an inserted tire iron, has requested that he be allowed to die by firing squad, officials said Thursday. Fourth District Judge Donald Eyre on Wednesday signed such a death warrant for Michael A. Archuleta, 49. But the April 5 execution is not likely to happen, considering Archuleta still make can federal appeals. The last convicted killer to die by firing squad in Utah was Ronnie Lee Gardner, executed in June 2010. Gardner was only the third person to die by firing squad in the United States since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976. Assistant Attorney General Tom Brunker said Archuleta, when convicted in 1989, did not  request a specific manner of execution, and was not legally entitled to die by firing squad. But the state did not object Wednesday to Archuleta's request, although it reserves the right to ask for lethal injection, Brunker said. Brunker said there is no question of guilt in the case. In 1988, according to court records, Archuleta and Lance Wood met Gordon Ray Church, 28, at a convenience store in Cedar City and rode with him to a secluded area. At that point, Church told them he was gay, and Archuleta began to engage in a sexual act on Church, but stopped. The two then bound Church, put him in the trunk of his car and drove to another location nearly 80 miles away. The two attached battery jumper cables to Church's testicles in a failed attempt to electrocute him. They inflicted blows to his head with a tire jack and iron, records show. A tire iron was forced inside the college student's rectum and it punctured his liver. Church's body was found with tire chains wrapped tightly around his neck, records show. The attackers took Church's wallet and watch, Brunker said. ""They both said the other one did everything,"" said Brunker. ""Archuleta's pants were soaked in the victim's blood. Wood had some blood spots."" Wood received a life sentence. An attorney for Archuleta did not immediately return a message left by CNN. But in one of three appeals, Archuleta raised questions about the competence of his previous counsel and alleged errors by the trial court. The Utah Supreme Court turned down that appeal in November 2011. According to Brunker, after a statutory change in 2004, lethal injection became the only available method of death in Utah for those who did not elect firing squad at sentencing. A spokesman for the Utah Department of Corrections said four of the eight individuals on death row initially asked for the firing squad option at the time of their sentencing. Seven were sentenced before the 2004 law change. In Utah, five anonymous marksmen, each with a matching .30-caliber rifle, are used in firing squads. They stand behind a wall cut with two gunports, said corrections spokesman Steve Gehrke. One of the rifles will hold an ""ineffective"" round, similar to a blank, which delivers the same recoil as a live round. The marksmen fire from a distance of 25 feet. The inmate is blindfolded and strapped to a chair with a target pinned to his chest.","Michael Archuleta, 49, was convicted in a brutal 1988 killing in Utah .

"Apple on Thursday lifted the veil on its plans to remake the educational landscape in a way that centers on its best-selling tablet computer, the iPad. ""Education is deep in Apple's DNA and iPad may be our most exciting education product yet,"" Philip Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of marketing, said in a statement. At a press conference in New York, the company announced three products that aim to get students and teachers to use the iPad's touch-screen interface to read, write, plan classes and communicate with each other. First, a free app called iBooks Author lets anyone create a digital, interactive textbook. In a demo at the event, an Apple employee created an e-book with the app in about five minutes, according to live blogs. Second, an update to a piece of software called iTunes U lets teachers plan their curriculum and communicate with their students over the iPad. The new iTunes U, which also is free and available on Thursday, will ""allow anyone, anywhere, at any time to take courses for free,"" Schiller said, according to Fortune.com's Philip Elmer-DeWitt, who was live blogging from the event. Fortune is a partner site of CNN.com. ""If you're an educator at a university, college, or K-12 school, now you have an easy way to design and distribute complete courses featuring audio, video, books, and other content,"" Apple's website said Thursday. ""And students and lifelong learners can experience your courses for free through a powerful new app for iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch."" Finally, a new textbook store called iBooks 2, also a free app, will feature digital e-books for schools. Apple said it is partnering with several major textbook companies -- including Pearson, McGraw-Hill and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, who will make e-books for the store, according to Fortune. High school textbooks will cost up to $14.99, the company said. In another demo, Apple's Roger Rosner showed off textbooks for the iPad that allow students to zoom in on pictures of cells, dissect digital frogs and make notes and highlights on the e-book pages. ""I don't think there's ever been a textbook that made it this easy to be a good student,"" Rosner said, according to Fortune. All of these moves are part of Apple's larger strategy to remake the textbook industry. The company reportedly has been courting schools to make use of its popular tablet computer. At the press conference, Schiller mocked paper textbooks, saying, ""They're not portable, not durable, not interactive, not searchable."" Books on the iPad are all of those things, he said, according to live blogs covering the event. Some educators seem to be excited about the changes. ""Apple has recognized that learning for students is not a one-way street,"" Jed Macosko, an associate professor at Wake Forest University, said in a statement. ""Until now, most traditional e-textbooks have focused on linear content delivery, which is not the way people learn. Research shows that we learn by asking questions,"" said Macosko, the author of an interactive biology textbook. Others questioned whether the move could give Apple too much control over educational content. ""(It's) not clear so far whether Apple's new textbooks will be open formats (ePub etc.) or only in Apple format,"" Mathew Ingram, a senior writer for the blog GigaOm, posted on Twitter after the event. Or they mocked the fact that Apple is trying to take such a big role in education. ""For a small upcharge, Apple will put a huge logo on your school and tattoo an Apple on each (student's) forearm,"" user @irasocol wrote on Twitter.","Apple announces digital textbook publishing app .

"His reputation is in tatters, the cycling victories that made him a legend are wiped away, and the sponsors that gave him enormous wealth have fled faster than a downhill race to a finish line. But that's only the beginning. Lance Armstrong is also being asked to pay back millions of dollars. And the term ""Armstrong era"" is now apparently a moniker for widespread cheating. The epic downfall of cycling's star, once an idolized icon of millions around the globe, stands out in the history of professional sports. His latest and biggest plunge came Monday when the International Cycling Union stripped the 41-year-old of his seven Tour de France titles. Livestrong bracelet: To wear or not to wear? ""Lance Armstrong has no place in cycling,"" said the union's president, Pat McQuaid, announcing that Armstrong is also banned from the sport. The decision followed this month's finding by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency that there is ""overwhelming"" evidence Armstrong was involved as a professional cyclist in ""the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program."" Armstrong has steadfastly maintained his innocence. McQuaid said he was ""sickened"" by the report. But he emphasized, ""Cycling has a future."" In a statement, the union wrote, ""Today's young riders do not deserve to be branded or tarnished by the past or to pay the price for the Armstrong era."" The group, which officially goes by its French name Union Cycliste Internationale, or UCI, is the cycling's world governing body. How an all-American hero fell to earth . Following the union's announcement, the French Cycling Federation said it was reissuing its call for Armstrong to return 2.95 million euros -- nearly $4 million -- that he collected for winning the tours. And $4 million might be a trifle compared to what SCA Promotions wants back. The Texas insurance company covered bonuses that Armstrong was promised if he won the Tour de France.  In 2002, it paid him $1.5 million; in 2003, $3 million, according to a Texas Monthly article that SCA posted on its website. But after his 2005 victory, SCA withheld a promised $5 million bonus, citing reports that Armstrong had doped. He fought back in court and won. SCA had to pay not only the $5 million but also attorneys' costs and fees, bringing the total that year to $7.5 million. The ruling as it happened . So the company could seek as much as $12 million back. In a statement Monday, SCA said it was ""considering all legal options to pursue a return of the funds paid by SCA to Mr. Armstrong."" Meanwhile, one of the sponsors that hadn't yet given up on Armstrong dropped out Monday. He was once ""a symbol of possibility,"" Oakley -- which has outfitted him in sunglasses and other gear -- said in a statement, adding that it looks ""forward with hope to athletes and teams of the future who will rekindle that inspiration by racing clean, fair and honest."" Heavyweights such as Nike, RadioShack and Anheuser-Busch have already fled team Lance, though, like Oakley, they've vowed to continue supporting the Lance Armstrong Foundation, which fights cancer through a program widely known as Livestrong. Armstrong does get to keep one prized possession from his Tour de France days. The Amaury Sport Organisation, which runs the 21-day tour, told CNN it will not ask him to return the yellow jerseys he won. Armstrong did not comment Monday.  At an event Sunday, he did not refer to the controversy directly but said it's been ""an interesting and at times very difficult few weeks."" ""People ask me a lot how are you doing,"" he told participants in his foundation's annual Ride for the Roses in Austin, Texas. ""And I tell them I've been better, but I've also been worse."" Though in the past he has often tweeted angry responses against those who accused him of doping, Armstrong has remained uncharacteristically quiet in recent days. His attorneys did not immediately respond to CNN's requests for comment Monday, and the foundation said it would not make a statement. Armstrong's story -- that of an outspoken cancer survivor who tamed the grueling three-week race more than any other cyclist before or since -- had made him a household name. But allegations of doping long dogged his career. Then came the USADA finding. Highlights of USADA report . The agency announced it would ban Armstrong from the sport for life and strip him of his results dating from 1998. The decision wiped out 14 years of his career. McQuaid said Monday the cycling union would not appeal USADA's decision. McQuaid, speaking at a news conference, said he does not believe cycling will ever be free from doping, because ""I don't think in any aspect of society there are no cheats. I do believe that doping can be hugely reduced."" The keys are education programs and how teams are structured, he said. Monday's news conference turned somewhat contentious as reporters asked whether the cycling union had looked the other way for years despite growing allegations of widespread doping in the sport. Armstrong had made two donations to the union for anti-doping technology. McQuaid insisted his organization never ignored the concerns raised about possible doping.  And he wrote off any suggestion that Armstrong's contributions had led the organization to make any decision on the issue. ""The UCI has tested Lance Armstrong 218 times. If Lance Armstrong was able to beat the system, then the responsibility for addressing that rests not only with the UCI but also with"" the anti-doping agencies that accepted the results, the cycling union said in its statement. The International Olympic Committee also is reviewing the evidence and could revoke Armstrong's bronze medal from the 2000 Sydney Games. With Armstrong's disgrace, will anything change? The cycling union will meet later this week to discuss whether to award the seven Tour de France titles -- from 1999 to 2005 -- to another rider. The group's announcement Monday leaves Greg LeMond as the only American to win the tour. He did so in 1986, 1989 and 1990. U.S. cyclist Floyd Landis was stripped of his 2006 Tour de France victory in 2010. In the past, Armstrong has argued that he took more than 500 drug tests and never failed. In its 202-page report, the USADA said it had tested Armstrong less than 60 times and the International Cycling Union conducted about 215 tests. ""Thus the number of actual controls on Mr. Armstrong over the years appears to have been considerably fewer than the number claimed by Armstrong and his lawyers,"" the USADA said. The agency didn't say that Armstrong ever failed one of those tests, but his former teammates testified as to how they beat tests or avoided the test administrators altogether. Several riders also said team officials seemed to know when random drug tests were coming, the report said. Armstrong stepped down last week as chairman of his foundation but said he will continue to be involved. Some of the foundation's donors are furious over the scandal and want their money back. ""We will not be deterred,"" Armstrong said Friday night at the organization's 15th anniversary celebration in Austin. ""We will move forward.""

"(CNN) -- Authorities have found a massive underground drug smuggling tunnel snaking through the U.S.-Mexican border, and law officers are marveling over its sophistication. The uncompleted tunnel measures 48 feet in the U.S. and 35 feet in Mexico. ""This is one of the most elaborate tunnels I've seen,"" Border Patrol agent Michael Scioli said. Border Patrol agents found the uncompleted tunnel last week, the patrol said in a statement. Measuring 48 feet in the United States and 35 feet in Mexico, the tunnel contains side walls framed with 2-by-4 wooden studs and ceiling construction. ""It's elegant in the sense it has electrical work wired into the Mexico side. It even has a hose for ventilation and lightning,"" Scioli said. The development points to successes law officers are having in uncovering the tunnels, with an additional 16 tunnels found since October 1. But it also underscores the skills and savvy of the drug smuggling industry. A resident tipped off the patrol about construction activity through the wall of a building in Nogales, Arizona. Agents arrested two people cutting a hole.","48 feet of tunnel is in United States and 35 feet in Mexico .

"Washington (CNN) -- A highly complex computer attack that may have been targeting Iran's nuclear power plants is posing a serious security threat to critical infrastructure worldwide, according to government and cyber-industry experts testifying Wednesday on Capitol Hill. The computer worm known as Stuxnet was discovered this past July and specifically targets computers that run critical infrastructure such as the electric power grid, water treatment and oil and gas pipelines. The head of the Cybersecurity Center at the Department of Homeland Security said Stuxnet is an incredibly large, complex threat with capabilities never seen before. ""This code can automatically enter a system, steal the formula for the product you are manufacturing, alter the ingredients being mixed in your product, and indicate to the operator and your anti-virus software that everything is functioning as expected,"" Sean McGurk told the Senate Homeland Security Committee. McGurk called the development of Stuxnet a ""game changer."" McGurk said there is not enough knowledge to identify what specifically was the target of the attack. ""To say it was specifically designed to target a particular facility is very difficult for anyone to say with assurance,"" said McGurk. However, a study by the Symantec Corporation, a cybersecurity firm, indicated Iran's nuclear plants could be the intended target. ""Stuxnet is a threat targeting a specific industrial control system likely in Iran, such as a gas pipeline or power plant,"" according to the report. Symantec official Dean Turner told the lawmakers that ""even if something like this is tied to one particular country or group of countries, the ability of it to have a global reach is enormous."" He said there were approximately 44,000 unique Stuxnet infections worldwide with 1,600 of them in the United States. Nearly 60 percent of the global infections were in Iran. Who was behind the attack also remains a mystery. DHS's McGurk said the department's analysis of the code did not point to where it was developed. The Symantec study did not identify a source of the attack. The sophistication of the malware makes it unlikely it could easily be duplicated by others. ""Stuxnet has such complexity requiring significant rescues to develop that few attackers will be capable of producing a similar threat,"" Turner said. The discovery of Stuxnet was a wake up call to government and industry, agreed all those who testified. Michael Assante, the president of the National Board of Information Security Examiners said, ""We're not only susceptible, but we're not very well prepared."" Enhanced cooperation between the federal government and private sector was cited as one key component to fending off cyber threats. Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, lamented that critical cybersecurity legislation needed to combat cyber threats will have to wait until the new Congress convenes next year. ""I'm sorry to say it seems unlikely we can pass this bill in this lame-duck session, although we should. I've been disappointed that the administration and some other committees that have an interest in this issue have been slow to engage,"" said Lieberman.","A Senate panel hears testimony about a new computer worm .

"(CNN)Even in celebrity-obsessed D.C., too much attention can be a bad thing. So as Congress got back to work last week, two freshman stars -- Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst and Utah Rep. Mia Love -- were trying to figure out how to navigate the spotlight, and in some cases, duck it. Ernst, a conservative favorite, is the first woman to represent the Hawkeye State in the Senate while Love is the House's first black female Republican. Ernst, a political unknown who rose to fame in 2014 with an ad promising she could cut pork in Washington because of her experience castrating hogs on her family farm, has signaled her media strategy by declining interviews since her election from anyone other than Iowa outlets. ""What we really want to do is focus on Iowa,"" she told the Des Moines Register. Over the holidays, Love had told a local Utah public radio outlet that she would try to avoid national media attention and focus on representing her district. But she has been a visible presence on the national stage since her win in November and during her first week in Washington. She agreed to a feature in People magazine with her family at their Saratoga Springs home. She made her first appearance on a Sunday show last week and spoke to Fox on Thursday night about her vote on legislation related to Obamacare. On Friday morning, she joined other House members on the floor to read aloud from the Constitution. ""One of the best pieces of advice that Ted Kennedy used to give incoming senators was to be a workhorse, not a show horse,"" said Stephanie Cutter, a former senior adviser to Kennedy and Obama.  Incoming members, ""regardless of their celebrity have to demonstrate that they are willing to roll up their sleeves, reach across party lines and get things done. If you do that successfully, then you are setting yourself up for whatever you want to do next."" As these two women navigate their way through the power corridors of Washington, they do not have to look far to see the damage that can be inflicted by overexposure. After her meteoric rise in 2008, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin's once promising career plummeted to the realm of reality television. The polarizing antics of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz have drawn the animus of his colleagues and are likely to limit his presidential ambitions. In a recent op-ed for the Boston Globe, former New Hampshire Sen. John E. Sununu, a Republican, said that when it came to working with Cruz ""the collective membership of the world's greatest deliberative body would rather stick needles in their eyes."" So far, Ernst and Love have pledged bipartisanship and careful attention to constituents of all political stripes. At one of her receptions on Capitol Hill this week, Ernst spoke about her plans to hold town halls in all 99 counties of Iowa this year—following the tradition of senior Sen. Chuck Grassley, who has been doing the tour known as ""The Full Grassley"" for more than 30 years. On Friday, Ernst's political action committee announced that she would host a ""Roast and Ride"" in Iowa in June. The hogs and Harley-themed event was a nod to her roots and former Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin's famed steak fry, which has lured many presidential candidates to Iowa in recent years. ""She wasn't elected to become a political celebrity, she was elected to serve the people of Iowa,"" said Dave Kochel, an Iowa-based Republican strategist who advised Ernst during her Senate campaign. ""It's part of the Iowa culture to be humble and not to call attention to yourself. Iowans respect people who understand that they are working for them."" In these early days, Love's election is frequently cited by colleagues as an example of growing diversity in the Republican Party. While she acknowledged her historic win on election night, Love has also signaled that she will resist the efforts of others to define her by her race and gender. When people have tried to draw her into those debates, she told the Salt Lake City public radio affiliate KUER, ""I said, 'Don't label me. First and foremost, I'm a wife, I'm a mother, I'm a Utahan and I'm an American.'"" In a sign of the pressures to come, however, Love was quickly drawn into the recent controversy over whether Republican House Majority Whip Steve Scalise should remain in leadership after it was revealed that he spoke to a white supremacist group in 2002. Love stood by him in her brief appearance on ABC's ""This Week."" ""There's one quality he has that I think is very important in leadership and that's humility,"" she said. ""And he's actually shown that in this case."" At the same time, she also drew notice by joining the Congressional Black Caucus this week, raising the eyebrows of its many Democratic members by saying she wants to change it from the inside. ""I think it's important to join and do what you can to make sure we are uniting Americans,"" Love told Fox host Greta Van Susteren Thursday. ""I don't want this divisiveness based on race or gender. We are all Americans."" When it comes to models for freshmen lawmakers, strategists often cite Minnesota Sen. Al Franken, the former comedian and 'Saturday Night Live' writer, and former New York Sen. Hillary Clinton as two who figured out a formula and stuck to it. During his first term in the Senate, Franken often refused national media interviews—even quick asides in the hallway—trying to make his mark by plowing into policy issues like net neutrality and mobile privacy. As the former first lady, Clinton's office was flooded with requests from national and international press during her first year in the Senate. But ""she declined 99.9% of those interview requests,"" said Patti Solis-Doyle, a long time adviser to Clinton who was her chief of staff on her first Senate campaign. Clinton tried instead to master local issues in granular detail, focusing on initiatives like getting New York into the Northeast Dairy Compact, addressing the economic divide between upstate New York and New York City, and championing the state's wine industry. (At a ""New York Farm Day"" hosted by Clinton in the Senate, she placed Boonville's Mercer's Dairy next to New York winemakers, inspiring wine-flavored ice cream that is now sold internationally). ""She really did have tunnel vision on what the job was, and what she needed to do,"" said Solis-Doyle. ""She spent a lot of time on the minutia and the nitty-gritty."" Clinton also knew her constituents had little patience for the media circus that surrounded her, Solis-Doyle added. To that end, she initially tried to fly under the radar, spending much of her time on constituent work, and making it clear that she knew her place as the junior senator—standing behind New York Sen. Chuck Schumer at the podium, for example, and waiting her turn to speak. Others who came to the Senate as big names like New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker are still struggling to find the right balance. Booker's superhero acts as mayor of Newark -- rescuing a neighbor from a burning house and routinely helping stranded constituents shovel out of the snow -- inspired a faux-jealous video spoof by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, as well as an enormous Twitter following. But while running for re-election to the U.S. Senate this fall, Booker told NJ.com that his goal for the year was to ""stay away from the media"" and ""earn the respect of my colleagues"" as a hard worker. Ernst and Love will face many of those kinds of decisions as they try to prove themselves on the national stage. ""They're both going to get an enormous amount of requests, not only for interviews, but also to travel and raise money for their respective parties and caucuses,"" Solis-Doyle said. 'They are going to have to think hard about how to balance all that."" To nurture their careers over the long term, she recommended following what she called 'the Hillary model': ""Keep your head down; keep your eyes and ears open; figure out how the place works and then do your best to provide for your constituents.""","Joni Ernst keeps a low profile in first week in Washington .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Karl Rove, President Bush's longtime political guru, refused to obey an order to testify before a House Judiciary Committee hearing Thursday. Karl Rove's lawyers says he is immune from a congressional subpoena. Rove's lawyer asserted that Rove was ""immune"" from the subpoena the committee had issued, arguing that the committee could not compel him to testify due to ""executive privilege."" The panel is investigating allegations that Rove and his White House allies dismissed U.S. attorneys and prosecuted officials who they saw as political opponents. The panel subpoenaed Rove in May after his lawyer, Robert D. Luskin, made clear the former White House deputy chief of staff would not appear voluntarily. Luskin responded immediately that Rove still would not appear, prompting a threat of prosecution from the Judiciary Committee chairman, Rep. John Conyers, a Michigan Democrat, and Rep. Linda Sanchez, a California Democrat who chairs the subcommittee on commercial and administrative law. ""A refusal to appear in violation of the subpoena could subject Mr. Rove to contempt proceedings, including statutory contempt under federal law and proceedings under the inherent contempt authority of the House of Representatives,"" Conyers and Sanchez wrote. ""We are unaware of any proper legal basis for Mr. Rove's refusal to even appear today as required by the subpoena,"" Sanchez said Thursday morning when Rove failed to show up. ""The courts have made clear that no one -- not even the president -- is immune from compulsory process. That is what the Supreme Court rules in U.S. v. Nixon and Clinton v. Jones."" In May, Conyers contrasted Rove's refusal to testify before Congress with his paid work as a commentator for the Fox News Channel and Newsweek magazine. ""Although he does not seem the least bit hesitant to discuss these very issues weekly on cable television and in the print news media, Mr. Rove and his attorney have apparently concluded that a public hearing room would not be appropriate. Unfortunately, I have no choice today but to compel his testimony on these very important matters."" Rove's lawyer cited a letter from the Justice Department saying Rove is ""constitutionally immune from compelled congressional testimony."" He said Rove is willing to submit to an ""informal interview"" or to answer written questions about the prosecution of former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman, whose ouster Rove is accused of orchestrating. ""Threatening Mr. Rove with sanctions will not in any way expedite the resolution of the issue,"" Luskin wrote in a letter to the panel on Wednesday. Luskin noted in May that his client had already received a separate subpoena from the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""While the [House] committee has the authority to issue a subpoena, it is hard to see what this will accomplish, apart from a 'Groundhog Day' replay of the same issues that are already the subject of litigation,"" the lawyer wrote, referring to a movie in which a person lives the same day over and over again. Luskin added that ""issues of executive privilege and separation of powers"" could limit Rove's testimony. In response, Conyers said the two committees are focusing on different matters, with the House committee delving into the prosecution of the former Alabama governor, a Democrat who lost his bid for re-election in 2002 and was convicted on corruption charges in 2006. Conyers also noted that other former White House officials have testified under subpoena in the past and have dealt with issues of executive privilege on a case-by-case basis. ""Mr. Rove should follow the same course,"" he said. Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, called the subpoena ""a sham."" The Democratic-controlled Congress has been battling for months to force the White House to disclose information about the firing of the attorneys and the prosecution of Siegelman. Current and former White House aides have refused to testify, citing executive privilege.","Karl Rove ordered to testify before the House Judiciary Committee .

"(CNN) -- Skeletal remains found in the chimney of an Abbeville, Louisiana, bank two months ago have been identified as those of a local man who hadn't been seen in 27 years. The remains are those of Joseph W. Schexnider, who vanished at age 22 in January 1984, Abbeville police Lt. David Hardy told CNN. Schexnider's disappearance was noted after he failed to show up for a court hearing on a charge of possession of a stolen vehicle. When officers showed up at his home to take him in to custody, Schexnider's mother said he had fled to avoid arrest. The remains were discovered in May when construction workers were doing renovations on the main branch of the Bank of Abbeville, a historic building that sits on the main square in the southwestern Louisiana town of 25,000 people. Tests done at a Louisiana State University forensics lab established the remains were those of Schexnider. The cause of death was likely dehydration and starvation, Hardy said. Foul play was not suspected and the case is closed, he said. But why Schexnider was in the chimney remains a bit of a mystery. Hardy told reporters that Schexnider had gloves and a cigarette lighter on him, but no bag or anything to indicate he planned to carry loot from the bank. Even if Schexnider had planned a burglary, the chimney would not have gotten him into the bank. Hardy said the fireplace that the chimney vented had no large opening at the bottom from which he could have emerged. How could the remains have gone unnoticed for 27 years? One, Schexnider had a history of running away, once even joining a traveling circus, Hardy said, so even his family was not actively looking for him. Two, the chimney opens on to the second floor of the red-brick bank building in Abbeville, Hardy said, and for decades the second floor had been used mainly for storage. Schexnider's family is not commenting on the case, Hardy said .","Joseph W. Schexnider vanished at age 22, when he was facing a stolen vehicle charge .

"Two Americans stole adult and infant body parts from a museum inside a Bangkok hospital and tried to ship them to Las Vegas, Thai police say. The two men, identified as Ryan Edward McPherson and Daniel Jamon Tanner, told police they wanted to surprise their friends back home, Royal Thai Police Deputy Commissioner Gen. Ruangsak Jritake said. It was not immediately clear whether McPherson or Tanner had attorneys. A delivery company intervened in the shipment. On Saturday, a DHL office in Thailand's Pathum Thani province called police after workers there were scanning shipments and discovered the body parts inside three packages. The packages contained five acrylic plastic boxes, Jritake said. One box contained an infant's head; another contained a baby's left foot, which was sliced into three pieces, the police official said. The other acrylic boxes contained an adult heart and adult skin. ""We have talked with an American who was trying to send the parcels to the USA, but we could not press any charges on him and we are not quite sure which laws we can apply to him."" Bang Pongpang police chief Col. Adisorn Semsawat said over the weekend. At the time, police said the American told them he found the infant body parts at a night flea market and that he had paid about $100 for them -- though he could not remember where the market was located. But on Monday, authorities revealed more details on the case. All the body parts were stolen from the Siriraj Medical Museum within Siriraj Hospital, the largest hospital in Thailand, Jritake said. The body parts were taken from the forensic medicine museum and anatomical museum. Police said closed-circuit video from the hospital showed two men identified as McPherson and Tanner. A Thai criminal court approved arrest warrants for the two men on charges of theft from a government hospital, police said. If convicted, McPherson and Tanner could face up to seven years in prison or a fine of up to 500,000 Thai baht ($15,200). But the Americans have already left Thailand for Cambodia. Thai officials may have to seek the two men's extradition. Thai police say they've been in touch with the U.S. Embassy. Not the first time . The bizarre discovery is not the first time infant remains have been found in Thailand. In 2010, more than 2,000 illegally aborted fetuses were recovered at a Buddhist temple in Bangkok. Infant body parts can be bought on the Thai black market. Some Thais practice black magic and believe that supernatural power comes from infant body parts, if the rites are performed by monks or sorcerers. They believe that having the items provides protection and business success and can ward off bad luck. Police say in 2010, the smell of decay led investigators to the Phai-nguern Chotinaram temple in central Bangkok, where they discovered more than 2,000 illegally aborted fetuses. Three people were arrested, including two morticians who were charged with hiding bodies. According to the hospital museum website, for 120 years ""Siriraj Hospital has collectively gathered an enormous compilation of medical equipments and tools, anatomical and clinical specimens including important artifacts and archives relating to the history of medicine in Thailand.""","If convicted, the two Americans could face 7 years in prison or be fined $15,200 .

"(CNN) -- The death toll on both sides from hostilities in Israel and Gaza is now over 1,000; among them are scores of children, and many more civilians are injured. Thousands are forced to flee their homes, and those who stay are left terrified by the bombs raining down. As negotiations for a cease-fire continue, many organizations have begun to provide relief to those in harm's way and to protect those affected by the crisis. UNICEF estimates that thousands of families in Gaza have seen their homes destroyed or damaged. ""UNICEF and partners are procuring essential pediatric drugs for hospitals and health facilities,"" its website says, ""and child protection teams are helping children and their caregivers cope with the psychological distress."" The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies is also on the ground in both Gaza and Israel. In Gaza, it is providing first aid and emergency support, with several medical centers operating where casualties are worst. Teams were able to enter some of the worst hit areas during short-lived ceasefires to help evacuate victims, many of whom were trapped in the rubble of destroyed buildings. In Israel, Red Cross partner organization Magen David Adom says it has treated hundreds for shrapnel injuries and psychological trauma. The organization is also providing ambulance transport for some critical patients transferred from Gaza. UNICEF stressed that ""the escalating violence in Gaza and Israel threatens devastating physical harm and mental distress for children on all sides, the effects of which can last a lifetime as their sense of security is undermined."" The American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee is working with the elderly and disabled in Israel to ensure that they have access to food and supplies, and providing psychosocial support for children in shelters. The Jewish Federations of North America are helping those Israelis in rocket range find safe spaces, as well as providing trauma counseling and other emergency services. The organization Medecins sans Frontieres has been supporting Al Shifa Hospital in Gaza City with a surgical team and other medical supplies. Save the Children has been working with local partners in Gaza to provide medical supplies and help those who have lost their homes with necessities such as baby food and mattresses. Mercy Corps is also providing assistance to civilians in Gaza, delivering food and necessities to those who need them, as well as medical kits to hospitals and clinics. As the conflict continues, pleas for peace echoed around the world. On its website, Save the Children joined other organizations in calling for an immediate cease-fire. ""We call for parties to address the root causes of violence that has left people in Gaza and in Israel caught in a cycle that must stop once and for all."" UNICEF tweeted a poignant quote, reminding us that children in conflict zones everywhere are perhaps the ones who suffer the most: ""I hate the future so much. We might live, or we might die."" The organization Seeds of Peace brings teenagers from around the world together to work on peacekeeping skills. A charter on its website reads, ""We refuse to be victims. We know it is possible to redirect human passions, even calls for revenge, toward the positive goal of creating peace.""","As the death toll rises, a number of organizations are helping in both Gaza and Israel .

"(CNN) -- Tips continued to pour in Saturday in the disappearance of an 11-year-old New Hampshire girl, but so far none have led to the child, Assistant Attorney General Jane Young said. ""We are looking at those tips. We are honing the investigation based on those tips,"" she said. The FBI offered a $25,000 reward for information leading to an arrest in the disappearance of Celina Cass, who vanished between 9 p.m. Monday night and the time her parents went to wake her Tuesday morning. Officials said a private citizen is also offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to Celina Cass' return. Dive teams will be brought in Sunday to search area ponds, Young said. About 100 investigators -- including FBI agents, New Hampshire and Vermont state police, local authorities and employees of the state's Fish and Game Department -- have been searching for Celina door-to-door in the small, tight-knit town of West Stewartstown. ""We are still aggressively, aggressively searching and hoping to bring Celina Cass home,"" FBI Supervisory Special Agent Kieran Ramsay said Saturday. Help has come from as far as Virginia -- including from FBI headquarters in Quantico -- Pennsylvania and New York, Young said . Celina was last seen in her room, at her computer, at about 9 p.m. Monday night, according to police. CNN affiliate WMUR reported that her parents told authorities the girl was gone when they went to wake her up Tuesday morning. Authorities have offered few further details on the case and an Amber Alert has not been issued. Young said that investigators are looking at computer and phone records, trying to find clues. Celina's disappearance has rattled many in West Stewartstown, a town along the border with Vermont and Canada with a population of about 1,000 people, according to the state of New Hampshire. Friends and relatives have spent much of the past few days putting up posters and doing what they can to find the girl. Friends have set up a Facebook page, ""Missing Celina Cass,"" with one of the fliers serving as a profile picture. According to the flier, Celina is 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighs 95 pounds, with long brown hair and brown eyes. She was last seen wearing a pink shirt, pink pullover and blue shorts.","NEW: Tips pour in, but have not yet led to missing girl, New Hampshire official says .

"A surgeon has been arrested on charges of negligence and attempted culpable homicide in the deaths of a dozen women who had undergone sterilization operations at a mobile clinic in one of India's poorest states. Dr. R. K. Gupta, assisted by a team of fellow medical professionals, operated on 83 women in a span of six hours Saturday in Chhattisgarh state. His arrest is one of several measures authorities have taken in response to the deaths and the resulting public outcry. By Thursday, authorities had halted all sterilization procedures in the Bilaspur district of Chhattisgarh, according to Sonmoni Borha, the district's commissioner. Six types of drugs -- including certain painkillers and antibiotics -- have been banned. Gupta claimed the women died due to those medications, distributed in a nearby village, rather than the operations themselves. While Gupta is the face of the latest outrage, the nationwide, government-run sterilization program has been going on for decades. It's part of a campaign to curb population growth in India, a nation of 1.25 billion people, second only to China in population. Women get paid (the women in Chhattisgarh each got 1,400 rupees, or about $23) to have the operations. And doctors are given incentives to do them. Gupta told CNN prior to his arrest that local health officials awarded him for the large number of sterilizations he performed. But it's also too often a deadly procedure. Advocates claim that conditions at such sterilization ""camps"" are sometimes unsanitary and dangerous. Gupta is being charged for the operations he did Saturday. A day later, some of the women began vomiting and experiencing severe pain. Twelve of those died, while scores of others are hospitalized. Another woman who was operated on Monday in another district in Chhattisgarh also died. Autopsy results expected this week . Clarity on whether the women died from the surgeries or the drugs they took afterward could come this week, when autopsy results come back, according to R.K. Vange, chief medical health officer for the area. Gupta has said his team followed all necessary safety procedures. Whether or not that is true, New Delhi-based Human Rights Law Network advocate Kerry McBroom said this is often not the case at mobile sterilization clinics around India. She told CNN that there's often no electricity, no running water and too few medical staff. ""It was almost inevitable,"" McBroom said of the recent deaths, ""given the unsafe, unethical and unhygienic conditions that persist throughout India in these camps."" Gupta said the government pressures doctors to perform more and more sterilization surgeries. Yet, with 83 in six hours, he might have gone too far. Government guidelines stipulate doctors should conduct no more than 30 sterilization surgeries a day.","Dr. R. K. Gupta is charged with negligence, attempted culpable homicide .

"(CNN) -- A 63-year-old man accused of sexually assaulting and impregnating his young relative is in federal custody, following his arrest three decades after and about 1,800 miles from where the alleged crime occurred. Deputy U.S. Marshals and law enforcement officers in Kentucky arrested James David Gibson on Wednesday, about two years after his alleged 13-year-old victim came forward to authorities. She waited several decades to tell her story because, at that point, her daughter was an adult and she felt that both were old enough to defend themselves, U.S. Marshals spokesman Chris DeRosa said Thursday. ""She didn't tell anyone leading up to that, for fear of her life and her child's life,"" said DeRosa. The alleged assaults occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s in Benson, Arizona, according to the U.S. Marshals Service. Authorities said that, after learning that the victim was pregnant, Gibson kidnapped her and together they fled to Tennessee. It was not until 2009 that the victim came forward and law enforcement authorities opened their case. By then, she was back in Arizona, more than 1,500 miles from Gibson. It wasn't immediately clear when the two separated. Soon thereafter, Gibson was tracked down in Tennessee. After he refused to provide a DNA sample, law enforcement tried to serve him a court order demanding as much. But by then, he'd fled the state -- prompting a warrant, issued in March of 2009, charging him with kidnapping and sexual assault of a minor, according to the U.S. Marshals. Gibson was eventually found again in Jenkins, Kentucky, where he was living with a granddaughter. By Thursday, authorities were awaiting clearance to extradite Gibson back to Arizona. The U.S. Marshals' office was not aware if, at that point, he had yet retained or been assigned an attorney. CNN's Greg Botelho and Marlena Baldacci contributed to this report.","James Gibson is in Kentucky, charged with kidnapping and sexual assault of a minor .

"(CNN) -- A replica of a 1910 aircraft built by flight pioneers Orville and Wilbur Wright crashed Saturday in a field near Springfield, Ohio, killing the two men aboard, the Ohio State Highway Patrol reported. The aircraft was reported downed shortly before 11 a.m., the agency said in a statement. It had taken off from Springfield Beckley Municipal Airport. Police identified the dead men as Don Gum, 73, of Beaver Creek, Ohio, and Mitchell Cary, 65, of Yellow Springs, Ohio. The cause of the crash remained under investigation, according to the highway patrol. It's looking into the incident along with the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board. The plane, owned by Wright ""B"" Flyer Inc. of Dayton, Ohio -- a volunteer nonprofit group -- was a copy of a Wright Model B aircraft produced seven years after the brothers' celebrated first powered flight. It began test flights in June and performed well, according to a press release on the organization's website. The organization designed the plane to resemble the 1910 edition, but built it so that it could be more easily taken apart and shipped to international events, the company said in the June press release. It was built with a modern engine, controls and materials, the organization said. Gum and Cary were members of the group's board of trustees and Cary was a former president, CNN affiliate WHIO-TV reported. ""Mitch and Don were highly competent pilots with extensive experience flying Wright 'B' Flyer airplanes and other experimental aircraft,"" WHIO quoted president Phil Beaudoin as saying.","Plane crashes near Springfield, Ohio .

"Hartford, Connecticut (CNN) -- Fred Wright may have grown up on Garden Street, but his early childhood was far from rosy. ""It's tough growing up here,"" said Wright of his low-income neighborhood in Hartford, Connecticut. ""There's a lot of negative influences. ... It's easy to take the wrong path."" Raised by a single mother, Wright struggled with behavioral issues and was forced to transfer schools several times. He ultimately reached a point where he felt like he had nothing to live for. ""I was walking around with a lot on my shoulders,"" he said. ""I couldn't handle it. I didn't care about life anymore."" But all that started to change when Wright met Patricia Kelly. ""I was 7 years old when I met Mrs. Kelly. ... I wasn't used to strictness. I wasn't used to hearing the word 'no,' "" said Wright, now 17. Kelly, a former U.S. Marine and an equestrian, took Wright under her wing and helped him find hope in an unlikely place: on a horse. ""Fred was like a round peg everybody kept trying to squeeze into a square hole,"" Kelly said. ""He was hurting. He needed a place he could express himself. The (riding) arena became that place for him."" For the last 30 years, Kelly has helped children in Hartford stay on the right track through her nonprofit, Ebony Horsewomen. The program offers horseback riding lessons and teaches animal science to more than 300 young people a year. ""We use horses as a hook to create pride, esteem and healing,"" said Kelly, 66. ""They learn that they have ability. They just have to unlock it."" Closing 'the gap' Connecticut ranks fourth among the wealthiest states in America, according to the Census Bureau. But it also has one of the nation's largest income gaps between rich and poor. Kelly, who has lived in Hartford most of her life, witnessed the effects of that inequality on the youth. ""It is a divided city; the children in the poorer neighborhoods have less resources,"" Kelly said. By exposing those children to horsemanship, Kelly aims to give them an alternative to the streets and an opportunity to turn their lives around. ""When you teach a child to ride a horse, they learn they are the center of their environment,"" said Kelly, whose program reaches children from age 5 to 19. ""Once they make that connection, they can change what happens in school, at home and in the community."" The group's equestrian and agricultural center is nestled inside a 693-acre park. Complete with a horse stable, riding arena and an ice cream parlor, it's a far cry from the dilapidated homes and boarded up school buildings that lie just beyond its gates. Kelly's equestrian fleet includes 14 horses and a Shetland pony. Also on the farm are chickens, rabbits, fish, birds and turtles, all of which have been bred by the children who have made this urban oasis their home away from home. A brotherhood on horseback . Among the programs offered by Kelly's group is its unique Junior Mounted Patrol, in which participants serve as park rangers. ""We're the eyes and ears of the park,"" said Wright, who is the lieutenant of the all-boys group. Led by older male mentors, the special unit is comprised of boys as young as 8, who meet each Sunday for a day full of activities. They tend to the barn and horses, take riding lessons and participate in wellness workshops. The older boys in the group ride out on patrol through the park. ""The guys have seen quite a number of things,"" Kelly said. ""They have seen drug deals. They've seen fighting. They've seen sexual acts. They've seen dumping. ... If they see these kinds of things, they report it back in and we turn it over to the police."" In the case of young men like Wright, the nonprofit has been a critical part of their development. ""I can't tell you where I would be without this program. It changed my life. It's helped me set goals for myself,"" said Wright, who has dreams of becoming an equine blacksmith and dentist. He hopes to attend Cornell University after he graduates high school next year. For Kelly, stories like Wright's serve as a testament to nature's healing powers. ""Children should have light in their eyes. The light signifies hope,"" Kelly said. ""When they come here, we can begin to turn the light back on."" Want to get involved?

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- A key transit link for NATO and U.S. military supplies into Afghanistan is expected to reopen in the next two days, a Pakistani military official told CNN Wednesday. Containers bearing supplies for US-led forces and NATO in Afghanistan pass through Pakistan. The supply routes in the Khyber Pass were closed on Tuesday after Pakistani forces launched an operation against Taliban militants in the country's tribal regions, Pakistani military sources said. NATO and U.S. military supplies were being re-routed, mostly air-lifted, the sources said. The operation is an attempt to halt militant attacks on NATO supply trucks, and recent attacks on several girls' schools in the Khyber region. The Khyber Pass -- an ancient, three-mile pass which links Pakistan to Afghanistan through the Hindu Kush mountain range -- has traditionally been a vital route into Afghanistan. Eight people -- two suspected Taliban militants and six civilians -- died in Tuesday's fighting which involved military helicopter gunships, according to Pakistani intelligence sources. The fighting took place near the town of Jamrud. The U.S. military praised Pakistan's incursion. ""We are pleased with the operation to clear out insurgent in the areas adjacent to the pass so our supplies can go unhindered,"" U.S. forces in Afghanistan said in a released statement. ""This temporary delay will result in the long-term gains for all that use that passage route. There is no immediate impact in our ability to provide supplies to the troops."" NATO countries are working on plans with countries in the north -- including Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan -- for possible new supply routes. Earlier this month, suspected Taliban militants attacked cargo terminals in Peshawar, Pakistan -- which sits along the transit route -- destroying NATO military vehicles carrying supplies bound for Afghanistan, Peshawar police said. It followed at least five other attacks against NATO and U.S. supply lines in previous weeks. Last month, Pakistani officials suspended travel through the mountain pass, citing security concerns. They reversed their decision a day later.","Pakistan launches operations against Taliban militants in Afghan border region .

"Washington (CNN) -- A federal judge dismissed manslaughter charges Thursday against five Blackwater security guards in the 2007 deaths of Iraqi civilians in a Baghad square, finding that prosecutors wrongly used the men's own statements against them. The September 2007 shootout in Baghdad's Nusoor Square left 17 Iraqis dead and two dozen wounded. The killings led Iraq's government to slap limits on security contractors hired by Blackwater, now known as Xe, and other firms. U.S. District Judge Ricardo Urbina found that the government's case was built largely on ""statements compelled under a threat of job loss in a subsequent criminal prosecution,"" a violation of the Fifth Amendment rights of the five men charged. ""In their zeal to bring charges against the defendant in this case, the prosecutors and investigators aggressively sought out statements the defendants had been compelled to make to government investigators in the immediate aftermath of the shooting and in the subsequent investigation,"" Urbina wrote in a 90-page decision. Federal prosecutors ""repeatedly disregarded the warnings of experienced, senior prosecutors assigned to the case"" in doing so, he found. Urbina also sharply criticized prosecutors and federal agents who developed the case, calling their explanations for using the guards' statements ""all too often contradictory, unbelievable and lacking in credibility."" ""In short, the government has utterly failed to prove that it made no impermissible use of the defendants' statements or that such use was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt,"" he wrote. There was no immediate response to the decision from the Justice Department, which can appeal Thursday's ruling or seek new indictments against the men. The men were guarding a State Department convoy moving through western Baghdad when the shooting began. The company said its contractors came under attack, but Iraqi authorities called the gunfire unprovoked and indiscriminate. Each of the now-former guards -- Paul Slough, Evan Liberty, Dustin Heard, Donald Ball and Nicholas Slatten -- faced 14 counts of manslaughter, 20 counts of attempted manslaughter and one count of using a firearm in the commission of a violent crime. Prosecutors requested that charges against Slatten be dropped in November, but Thursday's ruling dismisses the counts against all five. ""We're obviously pleased at the decision dismissing the entire indictment and are very happy that these courageous young men can begin the new year without this unfair cloud hanging over them,"" said Slough's lawyer, Mark Hulkower. A sixth guard, Jeremy Ridgeway, pleaded guilty in 2008 to voluntary manslaughter and attempted manslaughter.","Prosecutors wrongly used statements given under duress, judge says .

"We climbed the stairs to the third floor, where Osama bin Laden died early in the morning of May 2, 2011. I stepped into the bedroom where he was killed and looked up at the ceiling, where you could still see the patterns of blood that had spurted from bin Laden's head when the bullet fired by a U.S. Navy SEAL  tore through the terrorist leader's face. The height of the room was low for someone as tall as bin Laden, who was 6 foot 4. Outside the bedroom was a small terrace  surrounded by a high wall. Overlooking the enclosed terrace were large and now broken plate glass windows that would have provided a lot of light for bin Laden during the day. In the bedroom in which al-Qaeda's leader finally was killed, I had expected a frisson of something; perhaps a sensation like exploring Hitler's bunker complex beneath the streets of Berlin at the end of World War II. Instead, I felt only a mild curiosity. On a shelf in bin Laden's bedroom was a box of Just For Men hair dye; in the final years of his life bin Laden dyed his hair and beard jet black to maintain a youthful appearance. I also noticed some medicines like ampicillin, ibuprofen, Nestle energy glucose strips, Amplicox (a penicillin) and Spasler P syrup, which has an antispasmodic effect on the muscles of the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts. I examined bin Laden's tiny bathroom, about the size of a closet, and noticed that he used a toilet that was really only a hole in the floor over which he had to squat to do his business. It's not the image that one usually associates with the world's most wanted man. Next door to the bedroom, which he shared with his much younger Yemeni wife, was bin Laden's study. Crude bookshelves lined the walls and another large window overlooked the enclosed terrace. It was here that bin Laden composed often mammoth memos to his key lieutenants as he sought to maintain some measure of control over his organization, which was now under intense assault by the United States and its allies. Some of these memos are being released on Thursday by West Point. *    *    * . In February I secured permission to enter Osama bin Laden's compound in the northern Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where he was killed and where he had lived for the last half-decade of his life; the first, and only, journalist to do so. I was escorted by officers of Pakistan's military intelligence agency, ISI, past checkpoints manned by armed soldiers who were there to dissuade the merely curious from approaching the compound. Arriving at the front gate of the bin Laden residence, we were joined by a Pakistani Army captain wearing a sidearm. He would be our escort. I had been instructed ""no photographs."" Clearly, this rule would be enforced were it to become necessary. We entered through the main metal gate of the compound, which opened onto an internal narrow street with high walls on both sides. We then turned right into a small field, around a third of an acre in size, where the residents of the compound grew crops. This field was enclosed by the compound's walls on three sides, and on one of the sides there was a small storage shack for the harvested crops. I could see burn marks on one of the outer walls of the compound where the tail rotor of a helicopter had clipped the wall and broken off. It was the stealth Black Hawk helicopter that had developed mechanical problems during the U.S. Navy SEAL raid that killed bin Laden. There were also burn marks in the field where the downed chopper was subsequently blown up by the SEALs as the raid was ending. On the other side of the compound  were concrete feeding pens where the residents kept cows. Beyond that was a large garden where they grew vegetables such as cucumbers. In the vegetable garden there was a small ""hujra"" structure that functioned as a sitting room and that was littered with cardboard boxes for computer equipment. The bin Ladens also kept honeybees and rabbits. On the ground there were scattered cartons of Quaker Oats and large empty cans of Sasso olive oil. On one side of the compound was a self-contained, walled-off annex area. This is where bin Laden's trusted courier, Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, lived with his wife and four children. In this annex area was a simple garage  where bin Laden's courier parked his white jeep and red van. Inside the courier's one-story house, all the rooms were small and simple. They consisted of a washroom with a shower, a kitchen, a bedroom and a storage room. Children's toys were scattered around the floors of this building and children's bikes were parked in the storage area. There were medicine bottles and cough syrup on shelves in the bathroom and a calendar in the kitchen that marked Ramadan eating and prayer times. Follow @CNNOpinion on Twitter . On the night of the raid, Pakistani officials found the courier's body lying just outside his bedroom and behind a locked grey door with windows that had been shot out. The courier was killed with two bullets to the chin and his wife, Mariam, was  shot and wounded. The Pakistani intelligence official guiding me through the compound said there were no AK-47 bullets found at the scene and he therefore surmised that the courier had been taken by surprise and was shot before he could reach for his AK-47, which was recovered leaning against the wall of the Kuwaitis' bedroom. Leaving this annex area we passed through a metal door in an internal compound wall and came into a pleasant lawn area, in the middle of which was a small structure that was used by the residents as a sun room. Next to this was a water tank and a bread oven. Dominating the lawn was the three-story house in which bin Laden lived with his three wives and a dozen of his children and grandchildren. We entered the front door of the house. On the right was a study and on the left a bedroom. On the door of this room I saw graffiti, which turned out to be verses of the Quran. It was in this room where, after the raid, Pakistani officials found the courier's brother and his wife, both shot dead. Officials also found about a dozen children with their hands tied together in this ground floor bedroom. Deeper into the house was a kitchen and two sizable storage rooms. At the back end of the ground floor was a room where the bin Laden family would watch the sole TV in the compound. In this room was a gas heater that had an improvised exhaust system attached to it made from bits of sheet metal hammered together. At the back of the house was the stairwell. Blocking the way up the stairs was a massive yellow iron metal door that  sealed off access to the upper two floors of the house. This gate had large blast marks on it where the SEALs  forced their way through as they closed in on bin Laden. Halfway between the ground floor and the second floor, Pakistani officials found the body of Khalid bin Laden, bin Laden's 23-year-old son, who was shot and killed by the SEALs on the staircase. The SEALs shot to kill or wound most of the adults they encountered in the compound, killing four men, one woman and wounding two other women. Of the 11 adults on the compound (which included three of bin Laden's adult children: Khalid, 23, Mariam, 20, and Summiya,18) they shot seven of them. They did not shoot at bin Laden's two older wives. On the second floor of the compound were rooms for the older wives and for his various children and grandchildren. Their beds were made from plywood boards hammered together. As on the previous floor, there was an improvised system of metal pipes to remove the exhaust from a gas heater. In the kitchen of each wife's area there was a similar improvised exhaust system made from sheet metal to expel kitchen smells. The overall effect of all this was of a long-term but makeshift camping site and the overwhelming impression I had was one of squalor. Medicines for indigestion and other ailments littered the floor and there was a large amount of broken glass everywhere, testament to the intensity of the SEAL assault on the compound. This second floor had a terrace from which there was a lovely view of snow-capped mountains. From this terrace one could look down to an area where a guard dog was once tied and there was a coop for chickens. In the area where the chickens were kept I noticed several computer keyboards strewn about, presumably left there as the SEALs hurriedly carted off much of bin Laden's computer equipment. The image we have of bin Laden in his final years in Abbottabad is of an aging man with a graying beard watching old footage of himself; just another suburban dad flipping though the channels with his remote. And in the end, bin Laden died in a squalid suburban compound surrounded by his wives and children and far from the front lines of his holy war.","Peter Bergen was only journalist to visit place where bin Laden lived -- and died .

"President George H.W. Bush appointed me as the nation's first director of national drug control policy -- or ""drug czar"" -- in 1989. We took on many big fights, the largest of which was the cocaine epidemic spreading from the jungles of Colombia to the streets of the United States. We conducted an all-out assault on drugs through tough enforcement measures and public education. Contrary to ""war on drugs"" critics, drug use and addiction dropped across the country. The issue of marijuana legalization was far less prominent than it is today, although even then, some argued that we should experiment with legalization. I told them not on my watch; the cost to society would be too great. If you don't want to take my word that it can be harmful, perhaps you'll take Lady Gaga's. In a recent interview, the world-famous pop star admitted she was heavily addicted to marijuana. ""I have been addicted to it and it's ultimately related to anxiety coping and it's a form of self-medication and I was smoking up to 15 or 20 marijuana cigarettes a day with no tobacco,"" she said. ""I was living on a totally other psychedelic plane, numbing myself completely."" Lady Gaga said she was speaking out to bust the myth that marijuana is just a harmless plant. ""I just want young kids to know that you actually can become addicted to it, and there's this sentiment that you can't and that's actually not true."" Today a fully functioning experiment in legal marijuana for adults is going on in Colorado and another one is set to begin later this year in Washington. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis once remarked that in our democratic Republic, the states are the laboratories of democracy. We are running a few labs now and shall see what happens. But, as with any public debate, we need to hear all sides. So far, the advocates of marijuana legalization have dominated the public arena. It's certainly had an effect. According to a new CNN poll, a majority of Americans support legalizing marijuana. But where are the voices of the wounded? Where is the outrage from the families who have been hurt? We know they are out there. More Americans are admitted to treatment facilities for marijuana use than any other illegal drug. I've talked to parents all over the country who lost children to drug abuse -- not to marijuana alone; though in many cases it was a gateway drug or part of their deadly drug concoction. People have been deeply hurt by drug related accidents or spent thousands of dollars on drug rehabilitation. We need to hear their voices. During my tenure as drug czar, I traveled to more than 120 communities to see firsthand the impact of illegal drugs. Among those visits was a trip to Boston to take part in drug busts in some of the city's most broken and dangerous neighborhoods. Not once during that visit did a parent or community leader advocate for legalization or loosening drug restrictions. Rather, they wanted the drugs confiscated and drug dealers locked up. They knew the damage drugs had inflicted on their children and communities. That same evening Harvard University held a discussion on drugs and law enforcement. There I listened to scores of academics argue for legalizing or decriminalizing drugs. It's hardly an exercise in intellectual rigor for those in the middle- and upper-class who live in areas with little crime and violence to be willing to experiment with drug legalization. They live far removed from the realities of the drug trade. But travel to its core, to the slums and projects run by ruthless drug dealers, and these intellectuals may rethink their position. It's a myth that marijuana, because it is not as harmful as cocaine, heroin or some other illegal hard drugs, is safe or safe enough to warrant legalization. Opponents contest that marijuana hasn't ravaged communities or that the drug itself isn't to blame. But that's not true. It's ravaged the community of the young. Marijuana is the most widely used drug in the country, especially among young people. According to the 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, ""of the 7.3 million persons aged 12 or older classified with illicit drug dependence or abuse in 2012, 4.3 million persons had marijuana dependence or abuse,"" making marijuana the drug with the largest number of people with dependence or abuse. The medical community has warned about the danger. A recent Northwestern University study found that marijuana users have abnormal brain structure and poor memory and that chronic marijuana abuse may lead to brain changes resembling schizophrenia. The study also reported that the younger the person starts using marijuana, the worse the effects become. In its own report arguing against marijuana legalization, the American Medical Association said: ""Heavy cannabis use in adolescence causes persistent impairments in neurocognitive performance and IQ, and use is associated with increased rates of anxiety, mood and psychotic thought disorders."" The country can ill-afford a costly experiment with drugs. While we are undergoing a national debate over improving health care costs and education performance, legalizing marijuana will undercut those vital missions. We will wait and see what Colorado's and Washington's experiments hold, but I expect that after several years, we will see marijuana use rise dramatically, even among adolescents. The states will come to regret their decisions. As the late, great political scientist James Q. Wilson remarked, ""The central problem with legalizing drugs is that it will increase drug consumption"" -- and all its inherent harm.","William Bennett, nation's first ""drug czar,"" believes legal marijuana is bad for society .
Bennett says Lady Gaga agrees that pot is addictive and not just a harmless plant .

"(CNN) -- Singer Bruno Mars appeared in a Las Vegas, Nevada, court Wednesday morning to accept a ""deferred adjudication"" deal on a drug charge, his lawyer Blair Berk confirmed. Mars will avoid prosecution if he stays out of trouble for the next year, gets eight hours of drug counseling, does 200 hours of community service and pays a $2,000 fine, according to terms of a deal accepted in court Wednesday. The 25-year-old was arrested in a casino restroom last September, allegedly with 2.6 grams of cocaine in the left front pocket of his jeans, police said. The resolution of the singer's legal trouble comes three days after Mars won a Grammy for best male pop vocal performance and received a standing ovation for his onstage Grammy performance with Janelle Monae. Mars and Monae announced Wednesday they will start touring the United States together in May. Under the ""deferred adjudication"" agreement of the felony drug charge, the district attorney will not pursue the charge for 12 months as long as Mars complies with terms of their deal, Berk said. After a year, the charge would be dropped. Mars, whose real name is Peter Hernandez, was riding high on the music charts when he was arrested last year. His single, ""Just the Way You Are,"" shot to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart that month. His latest single, ""Grenade,"" is currently at the top of the charts.","The charge will be dropped if he stays out of trouble for a year, his lawyer says .

"(CNN) -- A U.S. military plane carrying three U.S. senators and one member of the House of Representatives came under fire Thursday night as it left Baghdad, Iraq, but it was not hit and flew safely to Amman, Jordan. Clockwise from top left: Sen. James Inhofe, Sen. Mel Martinez, Rep. Bud Cramer, Sen. Richard Shelby . A Pentagon source said the small-arms fire appeared to be random and came from too far away to hit the C-130 transport. On the flight were Sens. Richard Shelby, R-Alabama; Mel Martinez, R-Florida; James Inhofe, R-Oklahoma; and Rep. Bud Cramer, D-Alabama. Shelby described the situation as ""kind of dicey."" ""We were shot at by three rockets,"" Shelby said in a statement Friday. ""It was dark as the dickens, and I was looking out the small window on the plane and I saw a shell. We saw them, they were popping, and we saw the flares."" The flares are part of the missile avoidance system aboard the C-130 aircraft. The heat from the flares are a countermeasure to attract rockets that have heat-seeking guidance systems. Shelby added that the plane ""started maneuvering, changing directions, shaking us all around, and then I saw another shell near the plane. It's a hostile area, it was a tough area, but the flight crew was very professional; they really did a tremendous job."" Cramer, in a separate statement, said, ""Our plane leaving Iraq was fired upon, and it was a close call, but this is something that our men and women in combat face every day. The flight crew was outstanding, and I credit them for the way they handled the situation."" Multi-National Force-Iraq, in a statement issued Friday, said the C-130 crew ""dispensed flares as a defensive countermeasure and conducted standard evasive maneuvers. The aircraft, crew and passengers safely completed their flight."" In Baghdad, Iraq's government expressed hope that Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr's decision to suspend the activities of his Mehdi Army militia for six months will prompt other armed groups to follow suit. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's office issued a statement Thursday welcoming al-Sadr's announcement, made in the aftermath of clashes between Shiite militias in Karbala, Baghdad and Babil province. Security officials said there was fighting between elements of the Mehdi Army and Badr Organization, the armed force of the rival Supreme Islamic Council of Iraq. More than 50 people died this week as fighting broke out during a Shiite pilgrimage to the southern city of Karbala. ""This initiative is an encouraging step toward consolidating security and stability throughout the country and an opportunity for the suspension of the work of the rest of the militias in various political and ideological affiliations to preserve the unity, independence and sovereignty of Iraq,"" al-Maliki's office said. Al-Sadr's political movement ""will remain active"" and ""a true partner in the political process,"" al-Maliki's office said. On Friday, four policemen were killed and five people were wounded in a car bombing in northern Iraq, police said. The explosive detonated near a convoy in Samarra, said police in that Salaheddin province city. U.S.-led coalition troops on Friday killed five insurgents and detained 13 others in raids across Iraq, the U.S. military said. The five were killed and five were detained southwest of Balad in Salaheddin when troops targeted an al Qaeda in Iraq leader. ""Intelligence reports indicate he recently assumed a position coordinating terrorist logistics between Baghdad and Mosul, and may be trying to obtain chemical weapons for use in attacks against coalition forces,"" the military said. The military did not say whether the al Qaeda in Iraq member was killed or detained. Other raids occurred north of Tarmiya, in Baiji in the north and in Baghdad, where a suspected key leader in the city's car-bombing network was detained, the military said. On Wednesday, U.S. Marines, backed by air support, killed 12 men believed to be al Qaeda in Iraq terrorists in Anbar province, the U.S. military said Friday. According to the military, the Marines engaged a group of men loading objects into three cargo trucks near Karma, a town about 40 miles (64 kilometers) west of Baghdad. Marine Corps Harrier jets were called in and dropped two precision-guided bombs, destroying two vehicles. Marines said they found weapons and bomb-making materials at the scene. Also, a U.S. Marine and soldier were killed in separate attacks Wednesday in Anbar, the military said. Both were assigned to the Multi-National Force-West. The U.S. military death toll in the Iraq war stands at 3,730; seven civilian contractors also have been killed. The military has reported 79 U.S. troop deaths during August, matching last month's toll. Those figures are lower than fatalities in the previous three months, when there were 100 U.S. deaths in June, 126 in May and 104 in April. Meanwhile, about 1,500 detainees will be released from Iraqi prisons during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, a statement from the office of Iraqi Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi said. About 50 people per day will be set free from ""American prisons,"" al-Hashimi adviser Omar al-Jabouri said.

"(CNN) -- Citing the threat of avalanches, officials Tuesday suspended the search for two hikers missing since Friday morning on Mount Hood and held out little hope they would be found alive. ""Could they be alive?"" asked Dr. Terri Schmidt, physician supervisor for American Medical Response in Clackamas County, Oregon. ""Yes. Is it very likely? No."" The specialist in emergency medicine noted that time is not in their favor. ""What we know is that at about 48 hours -- two days -- the chances of finding somebody alive after that go down to about 1 percent."" She added, ""At some point, we have to say it's time."" Still, she said, Anthony Vietti, 24, and Katie Nolan, 29, have several factors in their favor: ""They're young; they're healthy; they -- as far as we can tell -- are relatively experienced and relatively well-equipped."" The body of a third hiker, 26-year-old Luke Gullberg, was found dead Saturday from hypothermia. Clackamas County Sheriff Craig Roberts said Tuesday that, despite the odds, the the search operation had not moved into a recovery operation. In fact, the search was not continuing in any form. Operations coordinator Nate Thompson bemoaned the heavy snow that fell over the weekend and forced the suspension. ""A lot of our clues are now covered,"" he said. Steve Rollins, a team leader with Portland Mountain Rescue, said the avalanche danger would not permit rescuers to venture out any time soon. ""Slopes that do not normally avalanche are avalanching now,"" he said. ""I don't see that we're going to have conditions that will permit us to put anybody safely on the ground in the foreseeable future."" Thompson hypothesized that the hikers may have been involved in an accident and that Gullberg, the most experienced of the hikers, may have broken away from the others and begun to backtrack in an effort to seek help. Above his body, rescuers found a water bottle, a helmet, a harness, a camera and camera case and a mitten belonging to Nolan. ""Maybe Katie lost a mitten in an accident,"" Thompson said. If Gullberg did indeed seek to return for help and Nolan lost one of her mittens in an accident, he may have left his gear, his pack and his supplies and gloves with her, taking the lone mitten, he said. But descending can be more difficult than climbing in some places. ""If there was some form of an accident and Luke did downclimb, this is a much more difficult descent,"" he said. National Weather Service meteorologist Charles Dalton told CNN that some 15 inches of snow had fallen at an altitude of about 6,000 feet between Monday and Tuesday afternoon, when temperatures were just below freezing. The three hikers, all from the Pacific Northwest, set out at about 1 a.m. Friday (4 a.m. ET), on what was to have been a fairly easy, ""semi-technical"" hike in which they would have descended the south side of the mountain, said Deputy Scott Meyers of the Clackamas County Sheriff's Office. Vietti's home is Longview, Washington; Nolan's is Portland, Oregon. Gullberg was from Des Moines, Washington. Gullberg's MySpace page is filled with photos of him hiking in various places. The mountain rises 11,239 feet above sea level, with a base that stretches across 92 miles (148 km). It is the highest mountain in Oregon. Mount Hood is a dormant volcano with steam constantly spewing from holes, according to the Web site mthood.info. Gullberg's death is the latest of many accidents on Mount Hood, KPTV reported. The worst occurred in May 1986 when nine people, including seven students from Oregon Episcopal School, died after they dug a snow cave during a sudden storm.","Officials cite avalanche threat, hold out little hope two hikers are still alive .

"HAVANA, Cuba (CNN) -- Cuba will allow its citizens to stay in hotels previously reserved for foreigners, the latest in a series of decisions to lift bans on goods and services that the average Cuban can't afford. The prohibition on staying in foreigners-only hotels unnerved many Cubans, who complained that foreigners were being afforded rights that were denied to ordinary citizens. Cubans will be allowed to stay in the hotels beginning at midnight Monday, said employees at several Havana hotels. Word of the change came from Tourism Ministry officials, the employees said. For most Cubans, the measure is largely symbolic, as hotel rates are unaffordable. Tourist hotels in Cuba can cost anywhere from $60 to more than $200 a night -- well out of reach for most Cubans, who earn fewer than $20 a month on average. The hotel announcement comes after the government lifted a ban last week on Cubans owning cell phones. That privilege, too, will be too costly for most Cubans.  Watch Cubans' reactions to cell phone privileges » . The Cuban government did not say how much cell phones will cost, but it currently costs more than $120 to activate a line. ""It's light years from what I can buy,"" one Cuban said of the cell phone cost. The relaxed rules represent the first nuts-and-bolts changes since February when Raúl Castro succeeded his brother Fidel as president. When he took the helm, Raúl  Castro said reforms would be on the way. ""I have referred to an excess of prohibitions and regulations, and in the next few weeks we'll start lifting the most simple of them,"" he said. The Cuban government also recently approved the sale of computers, microwaves and DVD players to Cubans -- items previously sold only to foreigners and companies. Before the ban on staying in hotels was lifted, Cuban critics called the restrictions ""tourist apartheid."" In a video that made the rounds on the Internet in February, a student asked the president of Cuba's National Assembly why Cubans could not travel freely to such resorts. Though such public displays of discontent are rare, the video echoed sentiments voiced in private for years, particularly since the fall of the Soviet empire in 1991. Cuba lost billions of dollars in subsidies when its ally fell. Cuba depends on tourism as its major source of revenue. On average, more than 2 million tourists visit Cuba annually. The country's Tourism Ministry recently announced that at least 10 hotels will be built in the capital, Havana, between 2008 and 2010. The United States has long sought to isolate Cuba's communist government and restricts American travel to the island nation. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN)  -- Community organization ACORN is fighting back after allegations that it is trying to register voters fraudulently and to swing the presidential election for Democrat Barack Obama. ACORN Executive Director Steve Kest announces the group's lawsuits and television spot Wednesday. The group this week released a 30-second TV ad calling on Republican candidate John McCain to stop ""attempts at voter suppression across the country."" It also said it was filing several lawsuits around the country to halt the alleged suppression. Republicans have ""challenged election officials, and they've filed lawsuits in an effort to thwart these new voters -- our citizens -- from casting their votes on Tuesday. This effort must be stopped,"" Delaware ACORN board member Hugh Alleyne said during a news conference Wednesday.  Watch ACORN, conservatives spar » . ACORN contends it tried to help authorities head off election fraud. ""In nearly every case that has been reported, it was ACORN that discovered the bad forms and called them to the attention of election authorities, putting the forms in a package that identified them in writing as suspicious, encouraging election officials to investigate, and offering to help with prosecutions,"" ACORN said in an October 9 news release. On Friday, a Pennsylvania judge rejected state Republican Party demands to obtain lists of voters registered by ACORN. The judge, Robert Simpson, said the Pennsylvania Republicans failed to convince him of the need for a preliminary injunction that would have required immediate action in the final days before the election. The state GOP accuses ACORN of widespread fraud in helping register some 140,000 voters in Pennsylvania. ""This kind of manufactured crisis is masking [Republican] efforts to keep voters from voting,"" ACORN spokeswoman Ali Kronley told CNN. The top lawyer representing the Pennsylvania Republicans said they were ""disappointed."" But, Heather Heidelbaugh added, the wording of the court order indicates the judge thinks ACORN has problems. Simpson said he would favor ""expedited discovery"" should someone want to pursue ""evidence that in Pennsylvania practices of ACORN Outreach Workers can encourage duplicate voter registration."" In Lake County, Indiana, nearly half of the 5,000 registrations ACORN submitted in early October were not good. Indiana's Republican Secretary of State Todd Rokita has requested a criminal investigation, and federal law enforcement officials are considering whether to open a federal investigation based on state reports. During the October 15 presidential debate, McCain said ACORN ""may be destroying the fabric of American democracy."" Officials for ACORN -- which stands for Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now -- calls such statements hysteria, but acknowledge that some of their hires have turned in improper voter registrations. On its Web site, the group contends that those employees were lazy and didn't want to work for their pay, making ACORN, not the public, the victim. Those workers have been fired and some even prosecuted, and the false registrations have not led to voter fraud, the group contends. ""Even the general counsel of the RNC [Republican National Committee] has acknowledged that he cannot cite a single example of an improper vote having been cast as a result of alleged voter registration fraud,"" ACORN Executive Director Steve Kest said. Former Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell, who headed up President Bush's 2004 campaign in Ohio, has said that Obama once was an organizer and trainer for ACORN. Obama's campaign says that's not true. As an attorney, Obama represented ACORN alongside the U.S. Justice Department in suing the state of Illinois to force state compliance with a federal voting access law, the campaign's Web site says. And ACORN was not involved in Project Vote, a voter registration drive that Obama ran in Illinois in 1992, according to the Web site. ACORN, founded in 1970, calls itself ""the nation's largest grassroots community organization of low- and moderate-income people."" It says it has more than 400,000 member families organized into more than 1,200 neighborhood chapters in 110 cities. Besides voter registration, the group focuses on issues such as predatory lending, minimum wage and funding for public schools, according to the Web site. It also provides free tax-return preparation for low-income people and screening for state and federal benefit programs. Republican hostility for ACORN goes back a long way. Former U.S. Attorney David Iglesias said the Bush administration fired him and eight other federal prosecutors in 2006 for political reasons, among them his refusal to pursue election fraud charges against organizations like ACORN. ""It's easy to make accusations, but ultimately a prosecutor has to prove that case beyond a reasonable doubt in federal court,"" Iglesias said. Officials with the McCain campaign maintain that the dumping of thousands of phony registrations on local election boards makes it harder for those boards to do their job, opening the door to voter fraud on Election Day.

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- It's time to deal with another scandal involving the Secret Service — one that leads directly into the White House. There have been several black eyes in recent years for what was once considered one of the nation's most celebrated law enforcement agencies. The organization responsible for protecting the safety of the President and the rest of the first family has done a poor job of protecting its own reputation. Besides having to shore up lapses in White House security and recovering from the resignation of its former director, Julia Pierson, the Secret Service now has to contend with more fallout from a story that seemed to be over and done with. When it comes to protecting itself, the Secret Service could take lessons from the White House. There, a cadre of aides, lawyers and spokespeople have become awfully skilled at covering up mistakes, missteps and misbehavior. And yet, the truth has a nasty habit of surfacing eventually. Such as whether a 2½-year-old scandal that Americans were assured was limited to Secret Service personnel might also have included someone affiliated with the White House. It was on April 14, 2012 — during the last presidential election — that the news broke that Secret Service agents had brought prostitutes back to their hotel rooms in Cartagena, Colombia. The agents were in South America to prepare for a visit by President Obama, who was attending a summit on economic development in Latin America. If the idea was to encourage infusion of U.S. dollars into the local economy, we can assume that federal agents paying young women for sex was not what organizers had in mind. You would think that one of the top law enforcement agencies in the world would be better at policing the behavior of its own personnel. In the end, nearly two dozen Secret Service agents and members of the military were punished or fired. But Obama administration officials — including White House Press Secretary Jay Carney — tried to contain the damage by insisting that no one from the White House was involved. Last week, in an astonishingly detailed front page story in the Washington Post, we learned that may not have been true. According to the Post, government documents and interviews reveal that senior White House aides — including Kathryn Ruemmler, who was then serving as White House counsel — were given information by the Secret Service at the time suggesting that the scandal extended to a member of the advance team who was in Cartagena at the behest of the White House. Jonathan Dach, then a 25-year-old law student at Yale University, was a volunteer with the White House travel office who helped coordinate drivers on the trip. He was paid a per diem, not a salary, and reimbursed for expenses. Still, according to the story, travel volunteers are often reminded that their conduct reflects on the President and first lady. The allegation was that Dach's conduct in Colombia left something to be desired. Despite the young man's insistence, through his attorney, that he didn't engage the services of a prostitute or invite anyone to his hotel room, the information that the Secret Service shared with the White House at the time suggested that Dach had registered a prostitute as an overnight guest. That's a serious allegation that should have been thoroughly investigated. But was it? The Secret Service shared its findings twice in the weeks after the scandal with top White House officials, including Ruemmler. Each time, the White House counsel and other White House aides conducted an interview with Dach and concluded that he had done nothing wrong. Those who support the Secret Service agents insist the White House should have dug deeper. In the end, nothing happened to Dach, whose father, it turns out, is a prominent and generous donor to the Democratic Party. At least try to look surprised. If the different outcomes seem unfair, you're not alone. Many in the Secret Service feel the same way, which probably explains how the story got out. There are reports of widespread dissension within the ranks of the agency over the Cartagena scandal. It gets worse. Let's not forget the politics. Remember, this was all happening during a presidential election year. David Nieland, the lead investigator for the Department of Homeland Security who was tasked to look into all this, told Senate staffers that he was told to delay the final report of the investigation ""until after the 2012 election."" Nieland also said that, during the investigation itself, his superiors told him ""to withhold and alter certain information in the report of the investigation because it was potentially embarrassing to the administration."" White House spokesman Eric Schultz insisted, ""Of course there was no White House interference with an IG (inspector general) investigation."" The picture seems to be coming into focus. What happened in Colombia showed bad judgment by Secret Service agents. If the allegations against Dach are true — and we can't be sure -- then his judgment was just as poor. And yet, despite the hijinks in Cartagena, it seems what happened next in Washington, on the part of White House officials, was the real dereliction of duty. Once again, the cover-up may have been worse than the crime. An unnamed administration official disputed that there was a cover-up, telling CNN the White House did thoroughly review the matter and found that Dach didn't engage in inappropriate conduct. Meanwhile, the Post said Ruemmler — who now practices law in the private sector — refused to talk about the case. It's no wonder why. She is being considered to replace Eric Holder as attorney general, and she probably didn't want to foul up her chances. That sort of thing could happen just by having your name linked to a scandal this unseemly. Too late. Ruemmler has already done that given the ham-handed way she dealt with the allegations against Dach. Her name should be taken off the short list to replace Holder. It's one thing to end your tenure as attorney general under a cloud, as sometimes happens. And it's another to begin it that way. Finally, 2½ years after his fateful trip to Cartagena, Jonathan Dach is still part of the administration. He works as a policy adviser at the State Department in you can't make this up, folks — the Office on Global Women's Issues. Even if you believe Dach did nothing wrong, the optics are bad. Now that's what I call a scandal.","Ruben Navarrette: It's time to deal with another scandal involving the Secret Service .

"(CNN) -- NBA star Yao Ming announced his retirement during a news conference in China on Wednesday. ""I need to make a personal decision,"" Yao said. ""I am ending my basketball career. I am very grateful. I like to thank my family members and my parents. And the Houston Rockets."" Voted an All-Star player eight times while playing for the Houston Rockets, he was one of the most successful overseas players in the league. Yao has chalked up a career average of 19 points, 9.2 rebounds and 1.9 blocks. His field-goal percentage was 52.4. In recent years, however, he struggled with foot and ankle injuries, and missed the 2009-2010 season.

"(CNN) -- I recently met a woman, the mother of three black teenagers. She told me that after the Trayvon Martin shooting, she forbade her boys to wear hoodies. She warned them never to walk around with their hands in their pockets. She was terrified that someone would find her boys acting suspiciously and one of them would end up being killed. This is one hell of a thing to be afraid of. I don't think parents of white kids ever really feel this terror -- not in this way. I defended the man who shot Trayvon Martin, and I believe that the verdict the jury returned was correct and just. But based on my experience defending young black men in the criminal justice system for 30 years, I know her fears are not without foundation. The shooting of Michael Brown -- an unarmed 18-year-old African-American in Ferguson, Missouri -- reinforces her fears, and it gives me a dull, empty feeling in my gut. We're hearing conflicting stories about how the Brown shooting happened. Some witnesses say the teenager had his hands up in surrender when an officer opened fire on him. The Ferguson police chief says the officer was attacked in his cruiser, and the first shot was fired inside the car. It's possible both accounts are true, but we don't know. Here's what we do know: A police officer and a black man interacted, multiple shots were fired, and Michael Brown was 35 feet away from the police car when struck by the shots that killed him. Soon we should know how many times the officer shot Brown, from how far and from what direction. These factors will be critically important in determining whether the shooting was justified or not. Black or white, an officer must be in fear of imminent death or great bodily harm before using deadly force, just like the rest of us. What we know about Michael Brown's shooting . If Brown was shot from far away, or if he was shot in the back, it would provide strong evidence that he was retreating -- that the officer was not in imminent fear -- and that the shooting was not justified. What we must acknowledge is that we don't yet know enough to be convinced one way or the other. Now there are cries of ""no justice, no peace"" as evening vigils turn violent, with rioting and looting. ""Justice,"" it seems in this context, can only be found if the officer is convicted of murder. If facts show the shooting to be justifiable, it will not be seen as justice by those making the demands. Whether my client is black, white, Latino or something else, here is how I want justice defined: Two sides, well-represented, present their cases in an adversarial system; the law is followed and a just result is inevitable. Brown's case will have the added benefit that it will be tried in the ever-watchful view of intense public scrutiny. Citing death threats, police won't identify officer in Michael Brown shooting . For many in the black community the reality of the criminal justice system doesn't measure up to the ideal. Many believe that the criminal justice system, from first police interaction to verdict, is infected with a racial bias that taints the possibility of justice as it should be defined. I have long argued in court that such a bias exists; that probable cause didn't exist for this car stop; that hanging on a street corner or sitting on a stoop is not loitering; that ""attitude"" is not resisting without violence. While the bias does exist, it's not simply a black and white issue. It's rare to find an overtly racist cop, or an overtly racist judge. The bias is nuanced; it's woven into the system, and it builds with each interaction with the system until, at last, it results in unequal justice. Consider the very first interactions: A cop and young black male interact on the street, and both give the other a bit of attitude. The officer gives some attitude because he's tired of getting attitude from other young men, and the young man gives some attitude because he's tired of getting attitude from other cops. Now, who's at fault? This, as simple as it sounds, is how it starts. Once the infection begins, it grows quickly. If you want to say the cop's at fault because he's the adult with training, you are right. And if you want to say the young man is at fault for disrespect or mistrust of a cop's authority, you are right. Missouri teen shot by police was two days away from starting college . If both sides refuse to move toward the middle, we will all just keep going down this path, and another black family will plan another funeral. Or we can agree that we, each of us, will be better off accepting responsibility for an infection that we cannot defeat individually. Who makes the first step? The police must. Many police agencies have community outreach programs that are successful. Police officers are in the position of authority, and they have the power to send a message that when they serve a community, they serve all the people of the community equally, regardless of race. To break this cycle, police must recognize there is bias in the system, and they make an effort to treat the people they serve with respect. In return, we must recognize the risks law enforcement officers take to protect our communities. We must respect their authority. And we must understand the grave reality that the way we engage a police officer can affect whether we walk away, whether we are driven away in handcuffs, or whether we are taken away on a stretcher. This is true for people of every race, from every community -- and unfortunately, with the current bias, it may more true for some of us than for others. For those who say that talking about this now is an insensitive way to blame Michael Brown for his own death, nothing could be further from the truth. No matter what turns out to have happened that Saturday afternoon, Brown was killed by the infection, by this insidious cycle. Let's see what we can accomplish if we focus on breaking that cycle.","Mark O'Mara: Michael Brown shooting raises concern about racial injustice .

"(CNN) -- There's little question that EDM (electronic dance music) is the fastest-growing musical genre out there. With DJs like Calvin Harris, David Guetta and Tiësto leading the pack, electronic music's popularity has ballooned in the past decade. From festivals to radio airplay, social media and even collaborating with A-list musicians, EDM artists are getting a lot of attention -- and money -- from all over the place. The numbers don't lie. So far, Forbes' top 10 EDM artists have racked up a combined $268 million this year, an 11% increase from 2013, with top earner Harris bringing in $66 million. How did this musical genre grow from a small, cult following into this global phenomenon we feel today? How have those who've stuck with it from the beginning grown with it? And where is it going next? To obtain these answers we headed to one of the biggest festivals in the world, TomorrowWorld, to meet up with some of the genre's key players: David Guetta, Tiësto, Steve Aoki, and EDM's newest dynamic duo, Dimitri Vegas and Like Mike. The origins of EDM . Electronic dance music is not a new genre. In fact, it's been around for more than three decades. David Guetta, whose DJ days began in Paris in the late 80's, recalls how the house/electronic music movement began when the disco era was ending. ""There was a movement called 'disco sucks',"" he says. ""It was a shame to like disco, but then there was no music to dance to, so some DJs started to use old disco records, but the B-sides and the acapellas, and we began producing beats with drum machines."" Simply put, DJs snuck disco music into people's ears. ""I remember buying those records and the label (vinyl sticker),"" says Guetta. ""(DJs) would use old records and print on top of it, melt it, and print on the top...very low quality, this was super, super underground."" In other words, disco music is EDM's ancestor. ""I started in '88 to play House music, it was a huge revolution for me. I went to London and I saw a DJ on stage and that was crazy at the time. I was one of the really respected and famous DJs in Paris, but they would never show me. I was hidden. A DJ on stage and people dancing and facing the DJ, looking at him? I was like 'wow!'"" says Guetta, as if still surprised to this day. A few years later, in the early 90's, in the Netherlands, Tijs Michiel Verwest began his journey to becoming Tiësto. He also started when the genre was completely underground. A trip to Spain, some parties and general love for music got him interested in becoming a DJ. ""Back then, first of all, we all played vinyl records, so even when you knew the track, you could not get it. Everything was very exclusive,"" says Tiësto in his dressing room, 300 meters away from the main stage of TomorrowWorld. ""That's the big difference with nowadays, because when you jam to a track you already know what it is, and then right away you have the song in your phone or your laptop...that was a very magical period because you played a track and people said 'I know this track,' but they still couldn't find it. That was very special,"" says Tijs, as his staff calls him. It's hard to pinpoint a date and location to the beginnings of EDM. Some say it began in Germany and London, others make a case that it started in Detroit, in the U.S. For Guetta, both continents played a role, ""this is what happened...it was born in the U.S., but the U.K. made it trendy. And it became a massive movement in Europe, but never in the U.S., which is crazy"". He later adds, ""I think America is always creating the new movement and then the U.K. has this genius of taking this concept and making it accessible to the masses."" From underground to the masses . Recently, Guetta has had mainstream success by collaborating with pop stars like Kelly Rowland, and The Black Eyed Peas, for whom he produced the best-selling single 'I Gotta Feeling' in 2009. Other successful DJs, including likes of Calvin Harris and Avicii, have also found success this way. ""I love collaborating outside of my space,"" says Steve Aoki, who has worked with artists like will.i.am and Luke Steele. ""When I got into the dance culture and started producing the music I kept on thinking how to do something unique or different than what the status quo does."" For EDM, collaborations may have attracted listeners, but the internet and its subsequent components, i.e. social media, apps and music sharing programs, have played essential roles in getting more. Nowadays, in the digital era, success is measured in followers, video hits, downloads, hashtags, tweets, retweets and likes. ""For us it (social media) has played a very big role,"" says Michael Thivaios of the duo Dimitri Vegas and Like Mike. ""We can make a new track and with one click, it'll be spread all over the world. Twenty years ago you had a vinyl, and that vinyl had to go to a distributor, and six months later maybe another country would have the vinyl,"" adds the other half of the duo, Dimitri Thivaios. ""All we did for one year is talk to DJs by Facebook and somehow that got us our first gig. Social media has been the biggest factor in our career."" In Europe and the Americas, mainly, there are an increasing number of electronic music festivals; events that gather people from all over the world and celebrate in unison. The TomorrowWorld festival celebrated outside of Atlanta, Georgia, gathered 160,000 people from 75 countries this year, according to the organizers. ""It's like a theme park for adults,"" says Thivaios. Not all genres can brag about selling out festivals with over 150,000 attendees, and do it in a matter of minutes. Sure, some could mention the Bonnaroos and the Coachellas of the world, but they offer musical variety. From pop to rock, rap to indie and even country. EDM festivals offer only EDM. ""When I'm on stage I'm looking out and seeing everyone putting up their flags from hundreds of different countries, representing hundreds of different cultural lifestyles. They're all jumping in unison forming almost like one entity, one spiritual being,"" adds Aoki, who, besides his music, is known for his selfies with the crowds, riding inflatable rafts, and caking one lucky fan per show. If you're confused about the latter, it's a Steve Aoki trademark, where he throws a whole cake to someone in the audience. Based on reactions seen from the fans, they love it. ""When they get caked in the face, the first thing they do is immediately turn around to make sure that everyone else saw that they got caked, it's a very bizarre thing. People don't get it,"" says Aoki, full of enthusiasm. Naturally, EDM was unlikely to become this popular without generating incredible amounts of money. A recent report stated that EDM is a $6.2 billion global industry. Most of the money comes from festivals, Las Vegas club dates and other global club gigs. All this peaked the interest of ad men and the big brands they represent. In fact, some have already made moves and are sponsoring festivals, events, and others have DJs featured in commercials. Business is good, but is the music getting better? EDM has been highly criticized. Many see EDM as an art that lost its purity. ""It's an evolution. The thing is that, every musical genre starts from the underground, gets trendy, then it becomes popular, and then it dies or it is reinvented in a different way,"" says Guetta. Many wonder if EDM is at his highest point. Is this its climax? Or will it end soon, just like Disco did? ""They've been asking me that since 1994, 'is it going to end?' I always say I don't know. It keeps evolving, every year something new comes up, and now it's at the highest it ever has been, so now I don't know how much higher and how much better it'll get,"" says Tiësto. ""It has been more than 20-25 years that this music is existing, so it's already amazing.""","Electronic dance music (EDM) has become a global phenomenon .

"(CNN) -- Actor Nicholas Brendon, best known as Xander Harris on the ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" TV series, was arrested in Boise, Idaho, showing signs of intoxication, police said. Brendon was in town for the Tree City Comic Con. Police were called to a downtown hotel Friday after reports of a disturbance in the lobby, according a news release from the Boise Police Department. ""When officers arrived, they found the suspect who showed signs of intoxication and repeatedly refused officers commands to stay seated while officers tried to speak with witnesses,"" the release said. ""When the suspect continued to try and walk away, officers took him into custody for resisting and obstructing."" The hotel staff said Brendon had broken a decorative dish and they wanted to press charges. He was booked into the Ada County Jail and bonded out, police said. Brendon is charged with two misdemeanors -- malicious injury to property and resisting or obstructing officers. Police say additional charges are possible. Brendon remained on the schedule to speak at an event Saturday evening. His Twitter account thanked fans for their ""love, support and positive vibes."" On Monday, Brendon took to his Facebook to write, ""I can offer an explanation but I make no excuse for my unacceptable behavior."" He said that he had a cyst behind his kneecap, for which he was taking pain medication, which he then mixed with alcohol. Calling the resulting episode ""embarrassing and unacceptable,"" he said, ""I intend to seek appropriate treatment and therapy for my medical ailments as well as my emotional demons."" He closed with, ""Again: I apologize. Those two small words don't begin to express my regrets, but they do mark the beginning of my recovery. During this difficult time, I appreciate understanding as I pursue rehabilitation -- and I value support as I earn redemption with my family, friends, and fans.""","Nicholas Brendon was in Boise, Idaho, for the Tree City Comic Con .

"Reykjavik, Iceland (CNN) -- Three stats tell part of the story. The United States -- one of the wealthiest nations on Earth -- has the second highest rate of childhood poverty in the rich world, according to UNICEF. (Only Romania fares worse.) About one in five American kids is poor, according to Census Bureau data. (For a family of four, the poverty level is an income of no more than $23,834). And, as of 2011, 3.55 million live on less than $2 a day, according to a paper from researchers at the University of Michigan and Harvard University. I'm on the road this month, however, to try to understand the human cost of child poverty in the United States. I'll be meeting with families who are struggling to make ends meet; talking to kids about what it's like to be poor in a rich country; and looking at the long-term consequences of allowing so many of our children to grow up amid financial turmoil. You can follow the trip on my Facebook and Instagram. Importantly, I'll also be searching for solutions. To that end, my first stop is Iceland, where I landed this morning. (It's 8:22 a.m. as I type this on a bus to Reykjavik, the capital, and the sun is nowhere to be seen, thanks to the extreme northern latitude.) It's famous for its unpronounceable volcanoes and Bjork, but Iceland also has one of the lowest child poverty rates in the world. I'm here to learn about several pioneering programs that aim to help poor kids -- and see what ideas America could steal. I'll also make a trip to California's Silicon Valley, home to Apple and Facebook -- and also to striking rates of child poverty. One in three kids in the valley is at risk for hunger, according to Caitlin Kerk, spokeswoman for the Second Harvest Food Bank in Silicon Valley. Sky-high rents -- more than $2,100 per month on average for a one-bedroom apartment -- make homelessness and food shortages shockingly common there, I'm told. Some 200 people are reported to live in an encampment for homeless people in San Jose that everyone calls ""The Jungle."" Apparently, poverty is everywhere in America. And in some places it's particularly extreme. In Detroit, for example, another of my planned stops, the rate nears 60%. Child advocates and academics say we've chosen to keep our poverty rate this high in the United States by rejecting policies that would help our kids and families succeed. ""There are a lot of things we can do for children that we're not doing"" in the United States, said Mary Hansen, an associate professor of economics at American University. ""We could dramatically reduce child poverty if we chose to,"" Larry Aber, a professor of applied psychology at New York University, who has studies solutions to child poverty, told me. I'm inclined to believe them. I can't think child poverty -- with its nasty outcomes, like prison time, low educational achievement and poor health -- is inevitable. But I'll be testing that hypothesis this month. I'd invite you to follow that journey on social media, and if you do, please, please ask questions and challenge my assumptions. You can help guide my reporting -- and the outcome of this project. CNN readers, after all, voted for me to report on child poverty as part of my Change the List project. This is the last of five issues you selected. Thanks in advance for your contributions. I'll report back soon.","John Sutter is on the road reporting on child poverty .

"(Mental Floss) -- 1. Skype . The idea of a video phone has been around for decades. While there have been a handful of real video phones, they were never widely available for the average Joe. Then, a company with a strange name harnessed the power of the internet and the ever-growing ubiquity of webcams to bring that dream to the masses. But what does the name Skype have to do with talking to other people online? Skype is a peer-to-peer communication technology, meaning one person connects to another person, via the Skype service. Of course to the average person, the connection is happening in a mysterious, ethereal realm. So when they were developing the name, they hit upon the rather descriptive ""Sky peer-to-peer,"" which was shortened to ""Skyper."" However, when they went to register the web address for their new product, skyper.com and the other .something variations were already taken. So, they decided to try dropping the ""r"" and, sure enough, skype.com was available. In hindsight, it worked out for the best -- saying you're ""Skypering"" with your friend sounds a bit clumsy. Mental Floss: Low-tech crooks thwarted by high-tech gadgets . 2. Etsy . Founded in 2005, the online marketplace Etsy has amassed over seven million registered users and saw revenues of just over $300 million in 2010. And while the name is catchy, many have often asked what it means. For a while, the company was pretty tight-lipped about the origin, leaving users to come up with their own acronyms or explanations. However, in a January 2010 interview for Reader's Digest, founder Rob Kalin finally revealed the secret: ""I wanted a nonsense word because I wanted to build the brand from scratch. I was watching Fellini's 8 ½and writing down what I was hearing. In Italian, you say 'etsi' a lot. It means 'oh, yes.' And in Latin, it means 'and if.'"" 3. eBay . For a while, it was widely believed that, in 1995, then-28-year old software developer Pierre Omidyar created a website called AuctionWeb so his fiancée could buy and sell PEZ dispensers. While the PEZ part isn't true -- Omidyar was simply looking for a way to make something cool online -- it does make for a good story. What's not legend, though, is that the first item sold on eBay was anything but glamorous -- a broken laser pointer. Omidyar only intended the laser pointer listing to be a test, but was surprised to find that someone actually bought it -- according to reports, the buyer collected broken laser pointers. Thinking he might be on to something, Omidyar started working in earnest on the program. While contemplating names for the site, he initially planned to use the name of his computer consulting company, Echo Bay. However, echobay was already taken (and still is). So Omidyar shortened the name to ""ebay"" and bought the web address that we all know and love. Mental Floss: How to tweet your way out of a job . 4. Bing . When Microsoft was developing the name for their new search engine, they wanted something that was a single syllable, memorable, and easy to spell. Of course once they got into the naming process, there were other things to consider as well. For example, one idea -- ""Bang"" -- was rejected because you couldn't make a verb out of it without sounding, well, inappropriate. (""What other movies has Kathy Bates been in?"" ""I don't know. Bang her and find out!"") So the marketers decided to put their money on ""Bing."" Not only was it a single syllable, easy to spell, and easy to remember, it also sounded like ""Bingo,"" which is usually said when you've found what you're looking for. The name also reminded people of the moment an idea is hatched, sort of like when that little light bulb goes off over a cartoon character's head. You hear a ""Bing,"" which is what Microsoft hopes will happen when you use their website. 5. Reddit . One of the fastest-growing websites around, Reddit was started in 2004 by then-college students Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian. The site allows community members to submit links to online content, which is then voted up or down to decide which submissions are most worthy of being read by everyone else. The name Reddit is little more than a play on the phrase ""read it,"" as in, ""I read it online."" But, as one member of the site (also known as a ""redditor"") pointed out, there is a Latin parallel to the site's name that turned out to be a pretty cool coincidence. One loose translation of ""reddit"" is ""render,"" which can mean ""to submit for consideration or approval,"" which is exactly what people do on the site. 6. Woot . Groupon and its ilk might be the talk of the town right now, but for the true innovator in the online ""Deal of the Day"" game, look no further than woot.com. Since 2004, Woot has offered a new item every night at midnight to devoted fans, known as Wooters, who obsessively check Woot's sites to buy everything from computers to flashlights to a ""Bag of Crap"" (BOC) -- a coveted, mystery grab bag that is often sold out within minutes of its unveiling. If you're at all familiar with internet culture, you'll know that ""woot"" is also an expression of excitement, sometimes spelled ""w00t."" According to Matt Rutledge, Founder/CEO of Woot.com, that is where the company got its name, but it goes a bit deeper than that. ""The company Woot was designed from the ground up to fit that name and adapt itself as a public 'employee store' type of liquidation retailer,"" Rutledge said. ""What type of store would you load up and say ""w00t!"" to? Answer...that would be what we built and strive every day to reach."" So Woot is named after ""w00t,"" but where does ""w00t"" come from? That's actually a bit of a mystery. Some believe it first appeared in the mid-90s, adopted from the songs ""Whoomp! (There It Is!)"" and ""Whoot! There It Is!"" Others define it as the acronym, ""We Owned the Other Team,"" originating as a victory cry for online gamers. Still others say it comes from an old hacker term used whenever someone has gained full, or ""root,"" access to a server, exclaiming ""w00t! I have root!"" And one more theory traces woot back to the game EverQuest. Whatever the origin, there are a few idistinctions between ""w00t!"" and ""Woot."" The company name does not have the zeros replacing the Os, and the exclamation point is only used in the logo or when there is genuine cause for excitement.

"(CNN) -- Three days ago, I decided to write an open letter to black protesters because I couldn't stay silent any longer. Since the death of Michael Brown, America has been in an intense debate over how law enforcement operates in communities of color. I am an African-American police officer -- a term that seems like an oxymoron these days -- and like thousands of other black men and women who wear blue, I exist in two worlds. The open letter, published by theGrio, was an attempt to offer solutions. I wrote about how proud I am to see young black men and women mobilize and rally for a cause but that too many in their movement overgeneralize and paint all law enforcement as corrupt. I explained how, contrary to what is often portrayed, the vast majority of cops aspire to be peacekeepers and that our good work often goes unnoticed. Finally, I offered what I believe could be achievable solutions to improve the relationship between law enforcement and the communities of color we serve. I wrote, referring to the protesters: . ""What they fail to understand is that I'm from the community and just one degree of separation from living in their world. My twin brother and I took different paths in life. He developed a dependency on drugs and spiraled into a life of crime that led to his incarceration. This is why making arrests is still a very difficult part of my job. Like 99 percent of those in law enforcement, I did not get into this profession to disrupt or end lives; rather, I want to save the lives of so many people -- like my brother. ""Most police officers do this job because they love the communities they serve. We chose to be in a profession where every day you get to make a difference, whether it's saving a child from an unhealthy home, coming to the aid of a domestic violence victim, finding shelter for the homeless or getting a reckless drunken driver off the road. ""Contrary to what many believe, we do not hope to have violent run-ins. It is actually what I dread the most."" In the piece, I decided not to give my full name. I didn't know what type of reaction or backlash to expect. For me, submitting this was not without risk. I feared being ostracized in the profession I chose, especially by the community I was born into and love. As expected, the post did receive a number of negative comments, which I won't give attention to because solutions rarely come from negativity. One thing that was abundantly clear from reading the reactions was how much television and movies have overtaken reality. There was an all too common perception that within every agency, there is a rogue, a power-hungry officer who would violate any policy in his attempt to destroy the black community. One commenter said it best, ""Bigoted bad guys don't just stick out like in movies twirling their mustaches and looking evil."" A few asked why I chose to single out black protesters when those involved in the movement are from all races. To that I say, while this is a national discussion, I believe the solutions are primarily local. I spoke to those who are part of our black communities and encouraged them to form relationships with local law enforcement and work with them to recruit more diverse police officers. I was pleasantly surprised by how many of the readers welcomed this encouragement. These are some of the voices from our community that the media often fails to represent. ""As an African American teacher in the American public school system, I can identify with his words. I know what it is like to do a thankless job and to be misunderstood and undervalued both when my professional uniform is on and off. A huge shift would come if people of color decided to take jobs in law enforcement and teaching."" ""Bro, I was proud that a black man and officer spoke up about it. It needed to be said. It was the truth of how African Americans act and respond in these situations."" But nothing was more gratifying than to hear the words of encouragement I received from fellow black officers representing various police departments throughout the country. They were relieved that someone had given them a voice. To hear their appreciation was emotionally rewarding. While people are protesting and searching for answers, I just hope they also consider there are police officers who are the living embodiment of the very solutions they seek.

"Los Angeles frequently had ""Stage 3"" smog alerts when I was a kid, meaning that we weren't supposed to play outside. Fortunately, those days are over. Air quality in California, including Los Angeles, has vastly improved from decades ago. But compared to other states and to the Federal Clean Air Act health standards, California is way behind on cleaning up its air pollution. The American Lung Association (ALA) just released its annual ""State Of The Air"" report listing the most polluted cities in the United States.  Of the seven worst cities ranked as having the worst air quality, six -- including Los Angeles - are in California, despite the state having the toughest regulations in the country.  Why is this? The two biggest air pollution culprits are transportation sources such as cars and trucks and stationary sources such as oil refineries and industrial facilities.  The ALA rankings look at two different pollutants: ozone (smog) and fine particulate matter. Ground-level ozone is formed when nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds ""cook"" in sunlight to produce ozone. This mix of chemicals largely stems from the burning of fossil fuels: the pollution that comes from our power plants and industrial facilities and from the exhaust pipes of our cars, trucks, ships and trains. The ozone smog that comes from this chemical stew burns the eyes, makes breathing painful and can cause chest pain, coughing, throat irritation and can worsen asthma. Children are at greatest risk from exposure because their lungs are still developing, and they are more likely to be active outdoors when ozone levels are high.  Rising temperatures from climate change will only serve to spur even more of this pollution. Particulate matter, the other major air pollutant in cities, is often smaller than the diameter of a human hair.  Just like ozone, fossil fuel combustion at power plants and by cars and trucks plays a major role in its production. The very small particles can lodge deep in the lungs, causing health risks such as premature death in people with heart or lung disease, asthma aggravation and decreased lung function. Children and seniors are at the greatest risk from particulate pollution.  And we're seeing these human health impacts all across Southern California and the Central Valley. If you've been to L.A., you know how bad the traffic is -- it can take me 2 hours to drive the 18 miles from my office to Dodger Stadium.  All those vehicles contribute to Southern California's horrible air pollution.  It's true that cars now emit fewer pollutants -- due to regulation at the federal and state level -- but Los Angeles simply has too many cars for the carrying capacity of the region. A massive increase in public transit, hybrid and zero-emission cars and trucks is a sound solution to help alleviate this pollution. The intense truck traffic on L.A.'s freeways is a symptom of the L.A. area ports' successes.  Over 80% of all U.S. imports from Asia come through these ports, and roughly 40% of those imports are moved by diesel trucks.  California state air regulators have taken strong steps to clean up the diesel truck fleet, but we are far from where we need to be -- diesel trucks, collectively, are still an enormous source of particulate pollution. Another solution is replacing fossil-fueled trucks that haul cargo containers to and from Los Angeles' ports with zero-emission freight movement systems such as electric trucks. Ports and regulators have already spent many millions of dollars developing these sensible 21st century systems, but industry has yet to deploy them. The San Joaquin Valley, California's other pollution center, is largely a rural area and home to the state's agricultural industry.  The wide, flat valley, like Los Angeles, is surrounded by mountains that trap air.  Since the valley's population is growing, there are also more cars and trucks. And two major north-south truck routes, I-5 and U.S. 99, bisect the valley. Off-road vehicles used in agriculture as well as agricultural practices such as burning off fields also contribute to particulate matter overload. I drove through the valley on my way to Yosemite National Park last October, but the smog was so thick I couldn't see the Sierra Nevada range until I was there. Bottom line:  too many cars and trucks, and too much fossil fuel combustion by vehicles, power plants and industry are the problem.  And climate change is only making it worse. But there's hope: California leads the movement towards a clean, renewable energy future, and if we can accelerate that transition, we have a fighting chance of getting off the ALA's ""worst"" list.","A new report lists the most polluted cities in the U.S., including several California cities .

"""It's why the American people hate Congress.  Unlike the people in Congress, we have actual responsibilities."" New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie dropped a bomb on Republican House Speaker John Boehner and Congress for refusing to allow a vote on Hurricane Sandy relief in the final hours of the 112th Congress.  It was an instant classic of principled political outrage.  It provided a strong dose of what Washington has been missing: blunt, independent leadership. Christie prosecuted the case by pointing out that hurricane relief had been provided more quickly to others: For victims of Katrina after 10 days and victims of Hurricane Andrew in Florida after 30 days.  But residents of the New Jersey and New York coast have been waiting 65 days to date for some relief. Christie also accurately pointed out that Northeast states such as New Jersey and New York send more to the federal government in taxes than they get back in federal aid, unlike many of the red states represented by conservatives in Congress.  The ""makers versus takers"" narratives fall apart fast when confronted with reality. Pulling no punches, Christie declared: ""Last night, the House majority failed most basic test of leadership and they did so with callous disregard to the people of my state. ... It was disappointing and disgusting to watch."" He also unapologetically named names: ""There's only one group to blame ... the House majority, and their Speaker, John Boehner."" He added that the relief bill ""just could not overcome the toxic internal politics of the House majority."" But Christie also took the high road in terms of decrying the overall atmosphere of hyperpartisanship in D.C., arguing correctly that ""Americans are tired of the palace intrigue and political partisanship of this Congress ... this used to be something that was not political. Disaster relief was something that you didn't play games with."" Politics: Republicans reverse outrage, pledge to back Boehner . Christie's broadside drew widespread praise on the Web. One tweet I saw from ""Ronnie"" in Chicago seemed typical: ""His dedication to his State is inspiring. I'm a democrat but damn, Christie's won me over. He has a damn heart."" Christie's fury was backed up by similar straight talk from New York Republican Congressman Peter King of Long Island. He blasted House leadership on CNN Wednesday morning: ""I would say the Republican Party has said it is the party of family values,"" he said. ""Last night it turned its back on the most essential value of all, and that is to provide food, shelter, clothing and relief for people who have been hit by a natural disaster. And I would say that the Republican Party has turned its back on those people."" This display of independence was a reminder that there is a distinct brand of tough Northeastern Republicans -- people such as Christie, King and Rudy Giuliani -- who don't simply toe the line with party leadership or ideological litmus tests.  Largely as a result, they are able to connect with centrists and independent voters and win on Democratic turf. This is a lesson for national Republicans as they look to reach out beyond their base. Christie and King's principled independence and tough talk against their own party leadership brought results. Within hours, Boehner and Republican House leadership announced that they would vote for an initial round of Sandy relief on Friday, followed by a vote on the remaining amount on January 15. Conservative activist groups such as Americans for Prosperity, the Club for Growth and Heritage Action all pressured congressional Republicans to vote against Hurricane Sandy relief, and while they helped block a bill from coming to a vote on New Year's Eve, the swift and unsubtle backlash brought a wise reassessment. All this is a reminder that straight talk in politics is so rare that it stands out and carries more than its own weight in civic debates.  It cuts through the spin and resonates beyond party lines because it is credible and rooted in reality. Most importantly, it gets results. Boehner's turnaround brought to mind a comment made by Christie during his press conference: ""No one is beyond redemption.""

"Cityscapes are usually breathtaking, but finding a good vantage point in a new town can be tough. Not for On the Roofs (OTR), a loose collective of photographers from Moscow who have made it their mission to shoot thrilling, often beautiful stills and video from the rooftops of the world's tallest buildings. They've been reaching the rooftops of the world's skyscrapers for the past five years, and have shot videos from Egypt to Belgium, Shanghai to South America. Once they're up there, they lean out perilously over edges and free-climb up towers, antenna and cranes, making anyone watching their immensely popular videos, uploaded to video sharing sites Vimeo and YouTube, as well as their own blog, squirm in their shoes as they marvel at the OTR members' daredevilry. Their latest stunt, published on YouTube on October 8 but already boasting well over a million views, shows four of them, identified at the end of the short video as Vadim Makhorov, Vitaliy Raskalov, Arseni Khachaturan and Nikolay Zheludovich (not their real names), climb a steel ladder onto the roof of a Hong Kong skyscraper and hijack a huge LED billboard. Once they're done with it, the sign flashes ""What's up Hong Kong?"" and shows clips of an earlier exploit, Makharov and Raskalov climbing the then-uncompleted 2,073-feet (632-meter) Shanghai Tower. No philosophy . After successfully taking over the signage, they pose for each other, and for a drone which is circling overhead, shooting the mission. They then rush down the stairs and out of the building, triumphant. ""There's no philosophy to OTR, we are just a small group of photographers, who like exploration, interesting places and some different countries,"" Raskalov tells CNN. ""Actually it's very simple, I bought a camera and after that I thought, 'maybe I'll try to climb on rooftops.' I took some pictures from the rooftops and thought, 'I like it' and after that we climbed all around Russia, we did a lot of cities and after that we traveled because Russia for us was finished and we thought it wasn't a bad idea to try something really kind of amazing."" He says they've climbed thousands of buildings in something like 50 countries. As well as going up, they also go down, trespassing onto subways and exploring the subterranean sides of the places they visit. The first time he went up, Raskalov says he was a ""little"" scared. ""Yeah a little bit, but now for us it's like a routine, you know? It's very simple. We started five years ago and since then we've climbed so much. I'm usually scared not about heights but about police. Sometimes we have to break into buildings. Sometimes if we go to a dangerous country, like an Arabian country, maybe this is a big problem if police caught us. That's the most scary part."" For the most part, the authorities are playing catchup to the rooftop raiders, although security as some landmark buildings, including the 1,227-feet (373.9-meter) Central Plaza in Hong Kong know their faces and to bar them entry. He says he doesn't worry about being barred from entering countries -- following Chinese media reports on their Shanghai Tower stunt he thought they might get a 20-year ban from entering the country, but nothing transpired and they have since revisited China. Computer hack . For the ""What's Up Hong Kong"" mission, he says the hardest part was figuring out the computer program that ran the LED billboard. The climb up the  659-feet (201-meter) China Online Center in Hong Kong's downtown Wan Chai district was a fairly routine one, and as for the computer terminal: ""We found it there! It was all a big surprise. We didn't know that we could change the sign when (we) went up. ""Finding the building, getting to the top was easy, because all the doors were open, we just go inside, find the stairs to the top, after that we found the computer (terminal), opened it up and played with it for two or three hours so this is how we made it play our video."" The climbers made headlines last year when they scaled the Great Pyramid at Giza, Egypt -- and later apologized when they were accused of disrespecting the ancient monuments. He says there's also some skepticism surrounding the veracity of what they're doing. It's not hard to see why; some of the footage is mind-blowing. ""Some people say, it's a nice video, nice action, but some people say it's a fake. Maybe 30% of people think it's a fake. Or a lot of people think the Hong Kong government gave us permission or money, or we do this stuff legally, but its not true."" He says there's a lot of interest in their work, and despite being apolitical, groups like the organizers of Hong Kong's pro-democracy protest movement have contacted them. ""People in Hong Kong messaged us about Occupy Central, asking how we could do the same stuff (as the LED billboard) with them. They wanted a yellow umbrella up there!"" But so far, it's just the thrill of the climb that keeps him, and his On the Roofs co-conspirators going. ""We don't have a message as such, it's just (for) fun. I guess our message is just 'what's up.'""","'On the Roofs' started climbing buildings in Russia five years ago .

"(CNN) -- A child throwing a ball. On the face of it, a simple act, but for four-year old Hannah Mohn this is a milestone. Hannah was born with the neuromuscular disease arthrogryposis, which makes her joints curve and muscles extremely weak. She can't lift her arms very high without help. ""We knew about five months into the pregnancy that something was not right,"" says Hannah's mother, Jennifer Mohn. ""We were told that they did not believe that she would survive birth and that we should really think about what we wanted done and make arrangements for the day that she were to be born."" Hannah survived, but with severe challenges and a long road ahead. Jennifer explains: ""When we saw my pediatrician ... for one of her first visits, she said even if her legs don't work well enough for her to walk, the biggest thing that we need to work on is making sure that her hands and arms are working to the fullest extent, because if she has use of her hands and arms, she will be able to care for herself. If she doesn't have the ability to use her legs, she can at least use a wheelchair. And that stuck with me."" Hannah's chance at a normal life came aged 18 months, when she visited the dupont Hospital for Children in Wilmington, Delaware -- a leading hospital in the United States. She began using a device the hospital designed, called the ""WREX"" -- robotic arms made from 3-D printing. ""WREX stands for Wilmington Robotic Exoskeleton,"" explains Whitney Sample, a research design engineer at the hospital. ""Most of the kids that we deal with have neuromuscular issues that affect their ability to raise their arms. So they have a lot of difficulty getting their hand to their mouth, doing typical activities of daily living -- combing their hair, scratching their nose ... so it allows their arm to pretty much float."" The WREX uses special elastic bands to give a child's arm a weightless feeling. ""The mechanism is similar to how a luxo lamp works to make it 'effortless' to move and position the head of the lamp,"" says Sample. It's a life-changing device, and one that's benefitted hugely from 3-D printing. Producing components on site by printing them layer by layer greatly reduces the time it takes to create a WREX. ""We can print a full set of plastic parts for one pair of WREXs for one patient overnight, and by the end of the next work day we can clean the parts and have the WREX fully assembled,"" says Sample, adding that metal components must also be made by traditional methods prior to assembly. Read more: How 3D printing will reshape the world . Even after 25 years designing devices for those with disabilities, Sample still gets emotional when children he has helped thank him for the difference he's making. When one child was given a school assignment to write a story about their personal hero, they chose to write about Sample. ""It's really nice to have that recognition when the families come back and say 'Hey, this has been wonderful for us,'"" he says. Arthrogryposis is a condition that affects one in 3,000 children born in the United States, according to the American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine. The dupont Hospital for Children says it sees a little more than 30 new cases each year. ""We treat all spectrums of orthopedic disease,"" says Dr. William Mackenzie, chair of the hospital's orthopedics department. ""3-D printing is allowing us to build devices very precisely -- to build a device that can be attached and be closely adapted to that individual person's physique and improve function. ""The next step, we think, is when we could put small motors in these joints that the child would control with either a twitch of the muscle or perhaps a laser. We don't know quite how might it be controlled, but we see that that is the future of the WREX."" Read more: 'The night I invented 3D printing' The device has helped improve Hannah's movements, even when she is not using it. ""The biggest change that we've seen is the ability for her to reach up higher and the ability to sustain that,"" says Jennifer. ""Her elbows are typically stuck at her sides and that's where she's been limited to raising her arms and reaching for things. ""She's gaining muscle strength in her arms that she hasn't had. It definitely teaches her about things with different textures and colors, shapes and where things go and how things work."" Teaching her, and opening up a future that knows no limits. ""My hope is that she grows up to be as independent as she can,"" says Jennifer. ""I'd love to see her go to college. As sassy as she is and as much as she likes to be in charge, she might run for president someday -- who knows? ""Up to this point there hasn't been much that she has let stop her. Whatever it is, she's going to achieve it."" Read more: How a 3-D printed arm gave hope to boy maimed by bomb .

"Moscow, Russia (CNN) -- St. Basil's Cathedral in Moscow, with its colorful onion domes, is an architectural icon. And now you can eat it. Pastry Chef Troman Felizmenio has created a piece of culinary art by making a gingerbread copy of the landmark for the holiday season. He works at the Ritz Carlton hotel near the Kremlin and Red Square. Creation of the edible cathedral, which is 2 meters (6.5 feet) high, began in early September and lasted nearly three months, according to a description from the hotel. Each day, Felizmenio spent two or three hours gathering the pieces together. ""When building gingerbread houses of this size, it is important to keep the proportions right. Otherwise the whole structure will collapse, and even the melted sugar, serving as the glue material, will not save it,"" the chef said in a press release. The gingerbread house is featured as a centerpiece in the hotel lobby. Felizmenio's creation has the same proportions and is an exact exterior replica of the 16th century cathedral. There is one big tower in the center and eight smaller, onion-domed towers around it, all richly decorated with royal icing. Ivan the Terrible, the tsar of Muscovy, commissioned the cathedral's construction to commemorate his 1552 military conquest of the city of Kazan, east of Moscow, which was the stronghold of the Tatars, a Turkic ethnic group. There is a chapel under each dome symbolizing one of Ivan's assaults on Kazan. A ninth tower was constructed in the 1580s to house the tomb of St. Basil the Blessed. Felizmenio and his team of bakers were making a limited number of smaller cathedrals to sell; prices start at 50,000 rubles ($1,600). CNN's Max Tkachenko and Deb Krajnak contributed to this report.","Pastry Chef Troman Felizmenio has created an edible replica of St. Basil's Cathedral in Moscow .

"President Barack Obama called Sunday for a ""thorough"" and ""rigorous"" investigation into allegations involving prostitutes and Secret Service agents in Colombia. Some 11 Secret Service agents and officers are being investigated over preliminary findings that they allegedly brought back several prostitutes to a hotel in Cartagena, U.S. government sources familiar with the investigation have told CNN. ""What happened here in Colombia is being investigated by the director of the Secret Service,"" said Obama, who spoke in Cartagena, where he was in town for the Summit of the Americas event. U.S. Secret Service agents sent home from Colombia . ""I expect that investigation to be thorough and I expect it to be rigorous. If it turns out that some of the allegations that have been made in the press are confirmed, then of course I'll be angry,"" he said. The alleged misconduct occurred before Obama arrived in Cartagena. The Secret Service personnel have since been sent back to the United States and put on administrative leave, the agency said. The U.S. military said that five U.S. troops who were working with the Secret Service are also under investigation for missing curfew and alleged ""misconduct"" at the same Colombian hotel. ""We're representing the people of the United States and when we travel to another county I expect us to observe the highest standards,"" said Obama. ""Obviously what's been reported doesn't match up with those standards."" Leaders debate Cuba, drug war at summit . Still, he cautioned: ""I'll wait until the full investigation is completed until I pass final judgment."" None of the agents or officers being investigated was part of the president's personal protective detail and Obama was not based at the Hotel Caribe, where the alleged misconduct occurred. But dignitaries and journalists reporting on the hemispheric meeting were staying there, a U.S. government official said. Rep. Peter King, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, was briefed on the matter and told CNN on Saturday that the government personnel brought prostitutes back to their rooms Wednesday night and ""one of the women did not leave the room in the morning."" A hotel manager tried to get in the room, and eventually the woman emerged and said ""they owed her money,"" according to King. Similarly, U.S. government sources said there was a dispute between at least one Secret Service member and a woman brought back to his hotel over a request to be paid. At least one of the women brought to the hotel talked with police, and complaints were filed with the U.S. Embassy, the sources said. ""The Secret Service saw that report, and they immediately began an investigation,"" King said. Secret Service spokesman Edwin Donovon said that the agents were relieved of duty Thursday -- prior to the president's arrival in Colombia -- and replaced after ""allegations of misconduct."" The agency's assistant director, Paul Morrissey, noted his agency's ""zero tolerance policy on personal misconduct."" ""This incident is not reflective of the behavior of our personnel as they travel every day throughout the country and the world performing their duties in a dedicated, professional manner,"" Morrissey said Saturday. ""We regret any distraction from the Summit of the Americas this situation has caused."" The U.S. military is conducting its own investigation and will mete out ""punishment, if appropriate ... in accordance with established policies and the Uniform Code of Military Justice,"" U.S. Southern Command said in a statement Saturday. Ronald Kessler, a former Washington Post reporter who has written a book about the Secret Service, called the incident ""clearly the biggest scandal in Secret Service history."" The Washington Post, which was the first to report the story, said it was alerted to the investigation by Kessler. Jon Adler -- president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, which represents Secret Service agents and other federal law enforcement officers -- urged caution in jumping to conclusions, characterizing the incident as ""isolated"" and not necessarily a scandal. ""That's just sort of an overdramatic interpretation of an isolated incident,"" he said. ""We have to trust the process of the internal review."" While soliciting prostitution is legal in certain areas of Colombia, it is considered a breach of the agency's conduct code, the government sources said. High-level officials in the Secret Service and the Department of Homeland Security were outraged over the incident, the sources said, noting that the investigation indicated the prostitutes were brought back to a hotel that had been secured for the summit.","Obama: ""I'll wait until the full investigation is completed until I pass final judgment""

"(CNN) -- Imagine discovering a plant that has the potential to help alleviate post-traumatic stress disorder, suicidal thoughts and paralyzing anxiety. That's what some believe ayahuasca can do, and this psychedelic drink is attracting more and more tourists to the Amazon. If you Google ""ayahuasca,"" you'll find a litany of stories about Hollywood celebrities espousing its benefits, as well as the dangers of this relatively unstudied substance that triggers hallucinations. On this Sunday's episode of ""This Is Life,"" Lisa Ling goes inside an ayahuasca ceremony in Peru and talks to the men and women who are drinking this potent brew in hopes that it will alleviate their mental and emotional traumas. Here are six things to know about ayahuasca, which some call a drug and others call a medicine: . War vets are seeking it for PTSD . Former Marine Lance Cpl. Ryan LeCompte organizes trips to Peru for war veterans, like himself, who are seeking ayahuasca as a possible treatment for PTSD and other emotional and mental trauma suffered after multiple combat deployments. He says he's aware of the risks, as there's very little known about ayahuasca's effect on the body, but he says ""it's a calculated risk."" ""Ayahuasca is a way to give relief to those who are suffering,"" says LeCompte, who says many veterans are not satisfied with the PTSD treatment they receive when they return from combat. ""It's just, 'Here's a pill, here's a Band-Aid.' The ayahuasca medicine is a way to, instead of sweeping your dirt under the rug, you know, these medicines force you to take the rug outside and beat it with a stick until it's clean,"" LeCompte explains. ""And that's how I prefer to clean my house."" Libby, an airman 1st class, is one of the veterans who accompanied LeCompte to Peru to try ayahuasca for her PTSD diagnosis, which includes sexual trauma while on active duty. She says antidepressants made her more suicidal. ""I would like to wish not to die all the time,"" she said, when asked why she was seeking ayahuasca. ""I want that to go away"" It's endorsed by some Hollywood celebrities . As more ayahuasca centers pop up in the United States, not surprisingly, celebrities including Sting and Lindsay Lohan have spoken publicly about their experiences with the substance -- albeit illegal outside of religious purposes in the United States. Lohan, who has struggled with addiction, called her ayahuasca experience ""eye-opening"" and ""intense."" ""I saw my whole life in front of me, and I had to let go of past things that I was trying to hold on to that were dark in my life,"" she said on her OWN reality series ""Linsday."" Sting said he and his wife, Trudie Styler, traveled to a church in the Amazon where they tried ayahuasca, which the British singer said made him feel like he was ""wired to the entire cosmos."" It's not a cure . Those of have tried ayahuasca say that any benefits -- like with other drugs or medicine -- must be combined with therapy. ""If you think you're just going to take 'joy juice' ... you're nuts,"" explained author and ayahuasca expert Peter Gorman, who settled in Iquitos, Peru, during the first wave of ayahuasca tourism in the 1990s. ""The five years of work to get rid of [mental trauma] is still gonna be on you."" Gorman, author of ""Ayahuasca in My Blood,"" explains that ayahuasca can help ""dislodge that negative energy"" and show people what their life could be like without the negativity. ""[Then] you can go back home and work on getting rid of it."" And it used to be taken by only the shaman . Gorman says ayahuasca traditions in the Amazon have changed since Western tourists began seeking its benefits. ""Traditionally, the shaman drinks [ayahuasca], he accesses other realms of reality to find out where the dissonance is, that if the shaman corrects, will eliminate the [symptoms] -- could be physical, could be emotional, could be bad luck,"" Gorman explains. ""[Then] we Americans come, and we said we insist on drinking the damn stuff -- we want our lives changed and we want that experience, so that certainly set things right on its head."" You can even buy ayahuasca powders and extracts online and in the local markets in the Peruvian Amazon, but Gorman warns ""you don't know what it would be."" As more and more Western tourists consume ayahuasca, Gorman says it has him worried. ""I've had this feeling in my bones for five or six years that something could go slightly wrong here that could sour a lot of stuff."" Some ayahuasca tourists have died . In April, 19-year-old Briton Henry Miller died after taking part in an ayahuasca ceremony in Colombia, according to various media reports. And Kyle Nolan, an 18-year-old from northern California, died under similar circumstances in August 2012 in Peru. The shaman who provided Nolan with the ayahuasca and who initially lied about his death was sentenced to three years in prison, his mother, Ingeborg Oswald, told CNN. There have been other reported deaths, as well as reports of physical and sexual assaults. Writer Lily Kay Ross says she survived sexual abuse by an ayahuasca shaman. ""We have to take seriously the potential for harm alongside the huge potential for benefit,"" Ross says on a video on a fundraising website for the Ethnobotanical Stewardship Council. ""Standards of safety and ethics would go a long way in making sure that this kind of abuse isn't experienced by anyone else."" Ron Wheelock, an American shaman who leads an ayahuasca healing center in the Peruvian Amazon, says he fears there may be more deaths. ""I hate to say it, yes there probably will be,"" he told Lisa Ling. ""It's in the cards"" There's a movement to create safe ayahuasca . Through IndieGogo.com, the Ethnobotanical Stewardship Council is raising money to create a health guide for ayahuasca centers in the Amazon, so tourists know which centers are safe and harvesting the plants in a sustainable manner that supports the local communities. The idea would be to put the ESC's logo outside ayahuasca ceremony sites to signify those centers that meet the council's criteria for safety and sustainability. In addition, there are efforts to study the medicinal benefits of ayahuasca so that it can be regulated and legalized in the United States, explains Rick Doblin, executive director of the Multidisciplinary Association of Psychedelic Studies. ""At a time when drug policy is being reevaluated, when marijuana looks like it's on the road toward legalization, when psychedelic medicine is moving forward through the FDA and we can envision a time when psychedelics are available as prescription medicines, how ayahuasca should be handled in a regulatory context is really up in the air,"" Doblin said.","Ayahuasca, or yage, is a brew made from a plant in the Amazon .
Some believe it can help with mental trauma and PTSD .
But there have been some deaths associated with it .

"The Indonesian police continue to use a ""degrading"" invasive physical test to check for female recruits virginity, a Human Rights Watch (HRW) report has claimed. A manual examination is used to physically check for an intact hymen in the recruits, the report alleges. It is, according to the report, a long-standing part of the health check that women must undergo to be accepted onto the force. While the virginity test is not specifically part of the required ""obstetrics and gynecology"" examination that female recruits are required to undergo to gain entry to the National Police, senior female officers told the report's authors that it has long been part of the process. Virginity a requirement . The National Police website lists the health requirements for female recruits, listing virginity as one of the requirements. ""In addition to the other medical and physical examinations. Women who want to become policewomen are to undergo a virginity test. Policewomen must keep their virginity,"" the informational page states. It ends the section with a cheery ""thank you"" and a smiley-face emoticon. Married women are not eligible to apply for service in the police force. Police: Exams applicable to both sexes . A police spokesperson told CNN that all recruits, not only female, were subject to thorough medical tests that included examination of genitalia. ""Overall, the medical and physical examination has two main objectives. The first one is to make sure that the candidates' health and physical condition will not harm them when admitted into police force,"" spokesperson Roni Sompie said. ""Secondly, it is to make sure that they do not possess any communicable diseases that will not allow them to perform maximally as trained police personnel,"" he said. ""As to the examination of the virginity, it is just a part of the whole medical and physical test, not intended to solely seek for the virginity condition. Or it can not be put in a perspective for the sake of finding out the virginity, instead, it is for the sake of the completeness of medical and physical examination."" Sompie also said that the HRW report was incomplete because it had not sought comment from police medical authorities. 'Discriminatory, cruel, degrading' HRW says they interviewed several female officers and applicants, as well as police medical and recruitment staff. They also say they spoke with a National Police commission member. The officers and recruits who had undergone the test called it ""painful"" and ""traumatic."" The report describes the test, administered by Police Medical and Health Center staff in police hospitals in the cities of Bandung, Jakarta, Padang, Pekanbaru, Makassar, and Medan, as ""discriminatory, cruel (and) degrading."" One recruit interviewed by HRW for the report said: ""Entering the virginity test examination room was really upsetting. I feared that after they performed the test I would not be a virgin anymore. It really hurt. My friend even fainted because... it really hurt, really hurt."" HRW called the test ""subjective and unscientific."" ""The Indonesian National Police's use of 'virginity tests' is a discriminatory practice that harms and humiliates women,"" said Nisha Varia, associate women's rights director at Human Rights Watch in a statement. ""Police authorities in Jakarta need to immediately and unequivocally abolish the test, and then make certain that all police recruiting stations nationwide stop administering it."" Outside condemnation . Women's rights advocates have corroborated the HRW reports' findings. ""Over the last 12 years, I have been visited by many police women complaining about virginity tests conducted by police department, with some of them (saying) they have suffered from trauma having conducted the test, because they felt painful and they felt ashamed of being tested. The trauma lasts even until now,"" Yefri Heriyani, of Padang based Women's Crisis center Nurani Perempuan, told CNN. ""We protest this virginity test, which is now disguised under the name 'medical and physical examination' ... Virginity tests (are) one of the forms of sexual violence, and therefore a human rights violation. We demand an end to this practice."" Reform attempts insufficient . Attempts to reform the physical and abolish the ""archaic"" test, HRW says, have failed and the use of the test still widespread. The group says virginity tests contradict internationally-agreed human rights standards. The rights organization has also cataloged similar abuses by police in several other countries including Egypt, India, and Afghanistan, and has previously spoken out against virginity tests for Indonesian schoolgirls. HRW say the report is counterproductive to the Indonesian government's aim to recruit more women to the police force. ""So-called virginity tests are discriminatory and a form of gender-based violence -- not a measure of women's eligibility for a career in the police,"" Varia said. ""This pernicious practice not only keeps able women out of the police, but deprives all Indonesians of a police force with the most genuinely qualified officers.""","Human Rights Watch condemns invasive virginity test for female police recruits .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Keen, bright-eyed and earnest, the little boy answers the Russian investigator's questions enthusiastically, as if describing a cartoon, not sexual abuse. ""He took off my underwear and photographed me,"" says the victim, whom Russian authorities are not allowing to be identified. The boy goes on to describe sexual abuse at the hands of his own father. Without this testimony, child advocates say, it would be impossible to convict the man, whose trial begins later this year. In Russia, possessing child pornography is not a crime and laws that govern child exploitation are weak. Government authorities say the majority of sexual crimes against children are never reported or investigated. Those are among the reasons that even the Russian government admits the country is a world leader in the production of child pornography. Russian lawmaker Elena Mizulina has been painstakingly shepherding a bill through the country's parliament that would finally protect children. ""For the first time people will be held criminally responsible for storing child pornography even if they don't distribute it. To this day, you can't punish anyone for that"" in Russia, Mizulina said. The bill has now passed its second of three readings in Russia's State Duma, the lower house of the legislature. The law can't come soon enough for victims. According to Russia's Investigative Committee, more than 800 cases of sexual abuse were reported in the first three months of this year, an increase of 13%. ""Analysis of such crimes indicates that sexual assaults against the integrity of minors and their rights and freedoms is mostly stemming from the lack of control by parents, guardians, as well as officials of educational institutions and local government officials,"" said Vladimir Markin, a spokesman for the Investigative Committee. Yet even with stronger laws, it is the testimony of young children that will ultimately bring punishment to those who prey on children. Yevgeny Tsymbal, director of a Children's Psychology Center in Moscow, told CNN that weak laws and lack of evidence usually help the abusers avoid detection and punishment. ""These crimes usually go on for a long time,"" he said, adding that because physical signs of abuse are often not apparent, ""these crimes are very rarely discovered."" The Internet is also a haven for child pornographers in Russia. This week, the Kremlin's child advocate, Pavel Astakhov, spoke in favor of a more stringent policy to force Internet providers to take responsibility for child pornography sites hosted on their servers and social networks. ""A person who wants to find this content on the Internet, this person can do it pretty easily,"" said Mark Tverdynin, director of Saferunet.ru, an initiative that is trying to scrub the Russian Internet clean of child pornography. The charity says it shut down as many as 7,000 such sites this past fall and winter. CNN's Maxim Tkachenko has contributed to this report.","Possessing child pornography is not a crime in Russia, and child exploitation laws are weak .

"(CNN) -- Desiré Henriksen feared that there would be no Christmas for her two boys. She had lost her job at Denny's, where she worked the graveyard shift. Her fiancé, who works as a glazier, was having a hard time finding regular work. And the couple fell behind on the mortgage last month. Desire Henriksen decided to sell her hair after losing her job and falling behind on her mortgage. So Henriksen, of Phoenix, Arizona, cut her hair and sold it on the Internet to a hair trader in the Netherlands. ""Everyone was telling me how beautiful my hair was,"" the 27-year-old said. Her friends suggested that she sell it. ""I thought, 'Why not? I'll check it out,' "" she said. ""We're trying to keep our place here,"" she said. ""We don't want to become like people right now who are losing their homes."" With the economy squeezing the budgets of more Americans, some people are looking for creative ways to pay their monthly bills. Selling hair on the Internet is just one of those unusual methods. ""We've seen about a 20 percent increase in the last four months,"" said Jacalyn Elise, co-founder of TheHairTrader.com, referring to the number of ads offering hair for sale posted on her site. ""These days, some people are just in need of money."" Henriksen was paid $1,200 for 27 inches of her tresses. But most hair is sold for about $300 to $900, says Marlys Fladeland of Hairwork.com. The hair is used to make wigs or hair extensions or is used in artwork. The longer the hair, the more it is worth. Untreated hair is also likely to fetch a higher price, Elise says. For Henriksen, cutting her hair was always in the cards. But she had planned to give it to a nonprofit organization that provides hairpieces for children who lost their hair after cancer treatments. ""Initially, I had grown my hair out to donate to Locks of Love in memory of my mother, who passed away from cancer last year. I was going to try to give back to people who didn't have any hair. But it didn't work out that way. Instead, I got my kids Christmas [gifts],"" she said. In addition to buying presents for her 10-year-old son and 3-year-old stepson, Henriksen paid off the overdue mortgage bill. She was so pleased with how easy her hairy business deal was, she says she's planning on growing her hair out again and selling it on TheHairTrader.com to help pay for her wedding. A professional lab rat . Others are taking more drastic measures, becoming medical guinea pigs. Paul Clough, 30, fell on hard times five years ago. A homeless man suggested that Clough take part in medical clinical trials, and now it's his full-time gig. Clough estimates that he brought in $28,000 this year by participating in seven medical trials, having his blood taken 500 times and ingesting about a dozen medications. The Austin, Texas, resident has tested everything from cholesterol-lowering drugs to hepatitis C and HIV treatments. He even set up a Web site, Just Another Lab Rat, which explains how and where to volunteer. Clinical research requires testing drugs on volunteers to determine whether the drug is appropriate for the market. The test subjects may be required to stay at a clinic or may have to visit the clinic a few times. Depending on the clinic and the trials they participate in, they may be paid $50 to $5,000 each time. Trials can last 10 days to a month. Safety concerns include side effects or drug reactions, but for many volunteers, the payout outweighs the risks. ""Some people live study-to-study,"" Clough said. ""They have immediate bills to take care of. And a lot of times, when people don't get into the study, they are concerned about how to pay those bills. They don't know what they're going to do."" ""Five years ago, it was mostly students,"" he said. But today, he sees ""Realtors, taxi drivers. ... It's any walk of life you can think of."" Your personal gold mine . Jeweler Les Harrell of Littleton, Colorado, struck gold when he had the idea to give people cash for their gold -- at parties. It started out as a fundraising event. But seven months later, he has a Web site, Gold Exchange. He's hired three employees, and he's throwing gold parties seven days a week. Friends and neighbors assemble to swap gossip, have drinks and get their jewelry appraised. Harrell pays cash on the spot for folks willing to hand over their gold. Later, he sells it on the market. He has operations in Colorado, New York and California. Deanna Molinaro was skeptical when she was invited to one of Harrell's gold parties this summer. But the Denver, Colorado, resident changed her mind after walking away with $700 for a wad of tangled gold bracelets, a herringbone necklace and some mismatched earrings. ""I was floored,"" she said, when she first heard about the cash. ""I made a lot of money on things that were lying around in my jewelry box for 20 years."" Harrell says he typically pays $5,000 per party, not including the cut the hostess makes and the referral fee. And it's not always jewelry he's appraising. ""I've seen it all,"" he said. ""Grandma's old dinosaur ring, gold teeth. I buy a lot of gold teeth, class rings."" One item he remembers fondly: Uncle Louie's bridge. ""It weighed almost 2 ounces,"" he said with a hint of amusement. People have, on average, about $300 worth of gold just lying around, Harrell says, and liquidating that hidden treasure can help them balance the family budget. Harrell's parties were initially geared toward the upper class, but his clientele is changing. ""What was fun money becomes, 'Oh, my gosh, this is a big help,' "" he said. In reality, a drawer full of costume jewelry, broken chains, errant earring backs and muddled memories may turn out to be next month's heating bill. One woman, living alone on Social Security, recently turned over a shoebox full of jewelry to Harrell to see what, if anything, she could get for it. ""She really didn't know what was real or not,"" related Molinaro, who helped with the transaction. But she cleaned out everything she had. In the end, her shoebox was worth $350. ""She was so excited to get it,"" Molinaro said. ""I got a big hug out of her for it, too.""","Many Americans are looking for creative ways to make ends meet .

"Hundreds of candidates are vying to become Iran's next president, with hopefuls ranging from friends to foes of current President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. A total of 686 candidates have registered for the June election, Iran's state-run Press TV reported. Ahmadinejad is term-limited and cannot run for a third straight term. But other big names are in the mix, including Ahmadinejad's top aide Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei and former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. Ahmadinejad has been grooming Mashaei to take over for years, and the two are like-minded in their nationalism and shared disdain for the clerical establishment, according to Geneive Abdo, a fellow at the Stimson Center's Middle East Program and a nonresident fellow at the Brookings Institution. But the Guardian Council, which is controlled by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, vets candidates and decides who is allowed to run for president, Abdo said. She said the council is not expected to allow anyone from the so-called ""deviant faction"" of Ahmadinejad's supporters to run. Rafsanjani, on the other hand, has long been a staunch critic and bitter political rival of Ahmadinejad's. He served two terms as president from 1989 to 1997. Weeks after the 2009 elections, Rafsanjani condemned the regime's violent crackdown against the opposition movement and spoke out for the people's right to peacefully protest. He later toned down the attacks and made statements of apparent support of the regime and the supreme leader, Khamenei.","President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is term-limited and can't run again .

"St Patrick's Day is upon us again. Time for the drinking world to pull on an unamusing leprechaun hat and order pints of the black stuff in a fake Irish accent. But why do we only celebrate the Emerald Isle's contribution to conviviality when there are other nations out there who love to wallow in drink just as much? In the interest of equality, we herewith embark on a global pub crawl to see who else we should invite to the party. Promise to drink responsibly and you can join us. 10. Australia . Australians are no longer the great drinkers they once were. Unlikely as it seems for a country where culture usually refers to something that grows in the folds of discarded sportswear, many Aussies have become refined in their tastes. Cheap lager is no longer cheap and, regardless, beer has been usurped by fancy wines. Still, they have a fine legacy. This is a country whose former prime minister, the legendary Bob Hawke, was once in the Guinness Book of Records for sculling 2.5 pints of beer in 2.5 seconds. Old habits die hard though, so if you do go drinking with Australians, you must still abide by the rules of ""the shout."" This means once you've accepted a drink as part of a round, you're obliged to ""shout"" everyone else a beverage in return -- a costly business now that they're all on the wine. Classic drink: ""Cardonay"" or a ""Sav"" -- typically Austral-mangled wine varietals consumed either pre- or post-stubbie (of beer). Hangover cure: Cold, leftover pizza, pies, fry-ups, 3 a.m. souvlakis and even Vegemite and cheese sandwiches are all favorites. But sculling 2.5 pints of beer in 2.5 seconds will do the trick every time.* . *CNN does not recommend this. Nor will it clean up afterward. 9. Germany . Think of Germany and the chances are you're thinking of a flaxen-haired fraulein hauling vast steins of beer through crowds of moustachioed men in leather shorts to the sound of an oompah band. Or perhaps you think about Angela Merkel. Each to their own. Germans may not be Europe's biggest beer drinkers -- that honor goes to the Czechs -- but somehow they've cornered the market in celebrating its consumption. This is largely thanks to Oktoberfest, Bavaria's month-long answer to St. Patrick's Day. In reality, although Germans do have a taste for hops, barley, malt and water, most drink steadily in rather more mundane circumstances. This is because beer can be bought and consumed not just in bars, but in shops, gas stations, newspaper stands and on public transport. Often without the aid of lederhosen or the sound of parping brass. Classic drink: White wine spritzer. Nah, just kidding. It's beer. Hangover cure: Herring and raw onion. But you'll need more beer to fix your herring breath. 8. Uganda . Uganda leads its African neighbors for alcohol intake, largely thanks to a rampant trade in illegally made rotgut and a winning formula of booze made from bananas. High on the menu is a potent liquor called waragi, also known as war gin because it was once used to fortify troops. Though drinking too much inevitably leads to surrender. Classic drink: Ajono -- a semi-fermented beer drunk from communal pots using long straws. Hangover cure: Luwombo -- another winning formula: meat cooked in banana leaves. 7. South Korea . In South Korea, booze acts like a pressure valve, allowing people to vent frustrations. Booze also acts as a lubricant, oiling the wheels of business. And, of course, booze acts like booze, getting people drunk. South Korea's strict social protocols seem to dissolve in alcohol, with the most hierarchical of relationships turning to brotherhoods by the end of the night, or early morning. A good session involves rapidly soaking up as many ""bombs"" (mixtures using ""golden ratios"" of whiskey and beer) as possible and then speaking (or slurring) what's left of your mind, preferably to your boss. To aid this process, glasses are emptied and quickly filled. Later, inevitably, stomachs are filled and quickly emptied. Classic drink: Soju -- to fans, a spirit capable of saving souls. To critics, cheap, sweet vodka. Hangover cure: Haejangguk -- a spicy ox blood broth. Sounds like a hangover, tastes like a cure. Also on CNN: How to survive a Korean drinking session . 6. Moldova . This tiny former Soviet state has earned a reputation for boozing thanks to some World Health Organization stats that placed it top of the table (surely under the table?) for alcohol consumption. There's been a lot of grumbling about where these numbers came from, particularly as they indicate most people would be too sozzled to respond accurately to any survey. If they are drinking to excess, the Moldovans have a decent selection of homegrown wines to choose from. They also have their own versions of popular East European fruit brandies. These have the same effect as knocking yourself on the head with a hammer, but without the unnecessary expense of buying a hammer. Classic drink: Boza -- a sweet, malty fermentation only marginally less disgusting than pickle juice. Hangover cure: Pickle juice. 5. Ecuador . You know you're off to a bad start when the local liquor is known as ""hangover in a bottle."" The best-selling Zhamir is a cheap but brain-penetratingly potent juice made from sugar cane that will get even the hairs on your head drunk after a couple of sips. There is a drinking etiquette in Ecuador. You must wait until a toast is made until you take the first sip of your drink. After that, you're on your own, but it hardly matters since no one -- least of all you -- will remember anything about it. Classic drink: Cristal. Another headbanging local hooch, not the posh champagne. Hangover cure: In a country known for its coffee, obviously the best cure is oregano tea. 4. France . The French may sneer at the uncivilized drinking habits of their European neighbors, but they're usually sneering with a glass of French vin close at hand. In France, wine is consumed alongside every meal except breakfast. It's often more freely available, and cheaper, than water. Only French wines will do though. Despite regularly losing taste tests to New World rivals, the French remain steadfastly loyal to their own vineyards, almost to the point of denial. Supermarkets rarely sell alcohol that isn't French. They're happy to eat snails, but they won't touch Belgian beer. Classic drink: Chateauneuf-du-Pape -- bold, peppery and over-confident. In other words: French. Hangover cure: Onion soup. Sorry, French onion soup. 3. Russia . For better or worse, drinking is a way of life in Russia. Not something that's necessarily done for enjoyment, but something that's stoically endured. Like a Siberian winter, gloomy literature or a shirtless political leader. Classic drink: Vodka. Hangover cure: Vodka. 2. China . China's rapid economic expansion has seen it become a major consumer of oil, steel and other raw materials. With all that thirsty work, it must surely also have its eyes on the rest of the world's refreshments. In the meantime, apart from Shanghai billionaires splurging on US$10,000 bottles of Chateau Margaux, the Chinese mostly stick to fiery grain-based liquors. The Chinese love celebratory drinking. Weddings, birthdays and business deals are all good excuses. Drinking takes the form of a series of increasingly incomprehensible toasts. To the outsider, this might seem tortuous. Just wait until the karaoke starts. Classic drink: Baijiu -- a white spirit that can also be used to clean vomit from inside a taxi. Hangover cure: Congee -- a porridge-like soup that unfortunately resembles stuff that could have been cleaned out of a taxi. 1. Great Britain . While the Irish have one date to celebrate their country's abiding love of alcohol, the British have three: yesterday, today and tomorrow. The near-constant drinking in the UK revolves around the pub. After a few pints, sometimes the pub begins to revolve, too. Alcohol is used by many Brits to overcome their traditional reserve. And so pubs are the places where relationships begin and end, deals are struck, scores are settled and the whole theater of life plays out to its dramatic conclusion. A range of light snacks may also be available. Classic drink: Pint of bitter -- traditional ale that, contrary to popular belief, is rarely served warm. Hangover cure: Full English breakfast -- a greasy plate of fried meat that, contrary to health and safety regulations, is rarely served warm.

"(CNN) -- Every day where we work, we see our young students struggling with the transition from home to school. They're all wonderful kids, but some can't share easily or listen in a group. Some have impulse control problems and have trouble keeping their hands to themselves; others don't always see that actions have consequences; a few suffer terribly from separation anxiety. We're not talking about preschool children. These are Harvard undergraduate students whom we teach and advise. They all know how to work, but some of them haven't learned how to play. Parents, educators, psychologists, neuroscientists, and politicians generally fall into one of two camps when it comes to preparing very young children for school: play-based or skills-based. These two kinds of curricula are often pitted against one another as a zero-sum game: If you want to protect your daughter's childhood, so the argument goes, choose a play-based program; but if you want her to get into Harvard, you'd better make sure you're brushing up on the ABC flashcards every night before bed. We think it is quite the reverse. Or, in any case, if you want your child to succeed in college, the play-based curriculum is the way to go. In fact, we wonder why play is not encouraged in educational periods later in the developmental life of young people -- giving kids more practice as they get closer to the ages of our students. Why do this? One of the best predictors of school success is the ability to control impulses. Children who can control their impulse to be the center of the universe, and -- relatedly -- who can assume the perspective of another person, are better equipped to learn. Psychologists calls this the ""theory of mind"": the ability to recognize that our own ideas, beliefs, and desires are distinct from those of the people around us. When a four-year-old destroys someone's carefully constructed block castle or a 20-year-old belligerently monopolizes the class discussion on a routine basis, we might conclude that they are unaware of the feelings of the people around them. The beauty of a play-based curriculum is that very young children can routinely observe and learn from others' emotions and experiences. Skills-based curricula, on the other hand, are sometimes derisively known as ""drill and kill"" programs because most teachers understand that young children can't learn meaningfully in the social isolation required for such an approach. How do these approaches look different in a classroom? Preschoolers in both kinds of programs might learn about hibernating squirrels, for example, but in the skills-based program, the child could be asked to fill out a worksheet, counting (or guessing) the number of nuts in a basket and coloring the squirrel's fur. In a play-based curriculum, by contrast, a child might hear stories about squirrels and be asked why a squirrel accumulates nuts or has fur. The child might then collaborate with peers in the construction of a squirrel habitat, learning not only about number sense, measurement, and other principles needed for engineering, but also about how to listen to, and express, ideas. The child filling out the worksheet is engaged in a more one-dimensional task, but the child in the play-based program interacts meaningfully with peers, materials, and ideas. Programs centered around constructive, teacher-moderated play are very effective. For instance, one randomized, controlled trial had 4- and 5-year-olds engage in make-believe play with adults and found substantial and durable gains in the ability of children to show self-control and to delay gratification. Countless other studies support the association between dramatic play and self-regulation. Through play, children learn to take turns, delay gratification, negotiate conflicts, solve problems, share goals, acquire flexibility, and live with disappointment. By allowing children to imagine walking in another person's shoes, imaginative play also seeds the development of empathy, a key ingredient for intellectual and social-emotional success. The real ""readiness"" skills that make for an academically successful kindergartener or college student have as much to do with emotional intelligence as they do with academic preparation. Kindergartners need to know not just sight words and lower case letters, but how to search for meaning. The same is true of 18-year-olds. As admissions officers at selective colleges like to say, an entire freshman class could be filled with students with perfect grades and test scores. But academic achievement in college requires readiness skills that transcend mere book learning. It requires the ability to engage actively with people and ideas. In short, it requires a deep connection with the world. For a five year-old, this connection begins and ends with the creating, questioning, imitating, dreaming, and sharing that characterize play. When we deny young children play, we are denying them the right to understand the world. By the time they get to college, we will have denied them the opportunity to fix the world too. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Erika and Nicholas Christakis.","Erika and Nicholas Christakis says they see students at Harvard who have trouble getting along .

"In the world of military strategy, every contingency must be examined, especially the worst-case scenario. Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, made that clear when he told National Public Radio in an interview broadcast Friday how U.S. officials must plan for the possibility that Vladimir Putin's Russia has access to American battle plans and other secrets possibly taken by classified leaker Edward Snowden. ""If I'm concerned about anything, I'm concerned about defense capabilities that he may have stolen from where he worked, and does that knowledge then get into the hands of our adversaries — in this case, of course, Russia,"" Flynn said of the former National Security Agency contractor who fled to Moscow to seek asylum. A hero to some and traitor to others, Snowden last year disclosed details of the vast U.S. surveillance network put in place after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, including how the government keeps records on billions of phone calls for possible use in terrorism investigations. Flynn said he worried about what else Snowden knows, and how Russia -- where Snowden lives now -- may have access to the documents. He cited intelligence capabilities, operational capabilities, technology and weapons systems as potential subjects of so far unpublicized information Snowden -- and Russia -- may have. ""We really don't know"" what Snowden's got, Flynn said, adding that ""we have to assume the worst case and then begin to make some recommendations to our leadership about how do we mitigate some of the risks that may come from what may have been compromised."" He added that the intelligence community also must assume that Russia either already has the information taken by Snowden or is trying to get it, adding ""that would be very serious."" Because of the possibility, ""we have to make some judgments, recommendations about ... how to respond to that,"" Flynn said. ""We're going to be dealing with this for many, many years,"" he noted, saying procedures, techniques and tactics currently in use may have to be changed. Flynn spoke as Putin has moved troops into the Crimea Peninsula of Ukraine in a showdown with the United States and its European allies over the former Soviet region's independence. In January, he and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told the Senate Intelligence Committee that the Snowden leaks already caused serious damage to U.S. security. ""What Snowden has stolen and exposed has gone way, way beyond his professed concerns with so-called domestic surveillance programs,"" Clapper said then. ""As a result, we've lost critical foreign intelligence collection sources, including some shared with us by valued partners."" Terrorists and other adversaries of America were ""going to school on U.S. intelligence sources' methods and trade craft, and the insights that they are gaining are making our job much, much harder,"" Clapper told the committee. ""Snowden claims that he's won and that his mission is accomplished,"" Clapper also noted. ""If that is so, I call on him and his accomplices to facilitate the return of the remaining stolen documents that have not yet been exposed to prevent even more damage to U.S. security."" Flynn told the panel that ""the greatest cost that is unknown today but that we will likely face is the cost of human lives on tomorrow's battlefield or in some place where we will put our military forces when we ask them to go into harm's way.""","Military strategy requires examining worst-case scenarios .

"(CNN)It's often said you can tell a lot about a man by the company he keeps. It's an aphorism worth remembering on arguably the most hectic day in the football calendar as clubs rush to grab a deal on transfer deadline day. And according to one football scout, a young man's friends can also tell you if he's going to make it big in the beautiful game. Lutz Pfannenstiel is a former player who now works for German club Hoffenheim, scouring the globe in the hope of finding a future star. Profiling players, and seeing how they behave off the pitch, is key to understanding whether they are right for the Bundesliga, insists Pfannenstiel -- who played for 25 clubs during a rich and varied career. ""I can go to Africa, I can go to Brazil, I can find hundreds of top class players. But the question is, will they really work in Germany?"" the former goalkeeper told CNN. A fan of big cats, Pfannenstiel has some David Attenbrough-like qualities in his observation of footballers. Whether they are in training, staying at a hotel, or even just socializing in a group, he watches them closely for signs of telltale behavior. ""It sounds very basic, but if I see a player who walks around by himself with big earphones on, and ignores everything that is around him, then I am not sure that that's the player I would like to have,"" he explained. Musical head gear is not the only thing that detective Pfannenstiel checks up on, with players' social lives being put under a magnifying glass too. ""Does he have bad friends? Is he going out on the weekend? Is he a really hard working professional? These are all things you can find out,"" he said. Networking is Pfannenstiel's modus operandi, allowing him to keep track of players across the globe without clocking too many air miles. Whether players know it or not, people close to them might be reporting back to scouts like Pfannenstiel, so it's important players are on their best behavior -- and keep the right company. ""There are guys who are basically looking at every woman in the team's hotel Is that really what you want? It's good to have a personal profile, it's good to see their behavior outside the football field."" Language can be another stumbling block for footballers hoping to make it big abroad, with Pfannenstiel setting a pass mark of being able to speak ""at least the basics."" The goal is for players to be able to gel with teammates both on and off the pitch -- if they can't then Pfannenstiel will have no qualms about waving ""auf wiedersehen"" to them. He hopes that they will not just communicate with other players, ""but also with the coaches, with the fans. The player needs to be liked by the fans to be 100% happy."" In many ways, Hoffenheim epitomize the current transfer market within football. For a provincial club with a humble history -- in 1999, their stadium held less than 1,700 fans -- Hoffenheim's status has been boosted by skilled players from abroad, recruited after some hefty investments from chief financial backer Dietmar Hopp. One foreign import who has impressed Pfannenstiel is Eugen Polanski, a Polish national player who joined Hoffenheim in 2013 and has since become an essential pillar of the team. Wilfried Bony has a similar story, originally from the Ivory Coast he was prolific with Vitesse in the Netherlands before joining English Premier League team Swansea in 2013. Bony was the top goal scorer in the EPL during the calendar year 2014 and has recently made a $42.5 million move to Manchester City. But not all players settle into foreign countries as easily as Bony and Polanski seem to have done. As Pfannenstiel argues, ""Many times players from these countries fail. Not because they're bad players -- they fail because they can't adjust. They can't adjust to the life, to the culture and to the surroundings."" Failure is not an option for Hoffenheim, which would rather coach their domestic players to stardom than buy brilliance from abroad. Tightening purse strings are another reason for the club to look for talent closer to home -- with some transfer fees skyrocketing during the January  window. ""The clubs who give players away, they know the prices are actually sometimes out of proportion,"" Pfannenstiel argues. The huge expense of some transfer fees means that clubs are under pressure to avoid any costly mistakes, leaving clubs like Hoffenheim to nurture local talent. ""We are not that desperate anymore to bring in foreigners left, right, and center -- we'd rather give youngsters a chance."" It's a tactic that Hoffenheim -- along with many other German clubs -- have used to their advantage. ""The number of players coming from the under 19's into the premier league in Germany is higher than it ever was before."" The search is now on for top talent in football, but Pfannenstiel won't be looking too far afield.","Lutz Pfannenstiel's transfer deadline day do's and don'ts .

"The Boston Marathon bombing suspects used Christmas lights and model-car parts to make the explosives, prosecutors said in court documents obtained by CNN on Wednesday. ""The Marathon bombs were constructed using improvised fuses made from Christmas lights and improvised, remote-control detonators fashioned from model car parts,"" federal prosecutors said in a motion filed Wednesday. ""These relatively sophisticated devices would have been difficult for the Tsarnaevs to fabricate successfully without training or assistance from others."" To obtain explosive fuel for the pressure cooker bombs, the filing says, brothers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev ""appeared to have crushed and emptied hundreds of individual fireworks containing black powder."" Authorities say Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 20, planted bombs at the finish line of the 2013 race. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed during the manhunt that paralyzed Boston. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty to killing four people and wounding more than 200. It's not time yet for prosecutors to make their full case against Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, but as attorneys spar over what evidence can be used in the high-profile death penalty case against him, the description of what materials were used to make the bombs was among several new details about last year's terror attack and its aftermath included in court documents. The motion also includes additional details about the note Dzhokhar Tsarnaev allegedly wrote while he was hiding out inside a boat in a backyard in Watertown, Massachusetts. ""God has a plan for each person,"" Tsarnaev wrote, according to the court document. ""Mine was to hide in this boat and shed some light on our actions."" In their 29-page motion, prosecutors detail Tsarnaev's medical care while at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, arguing that information from more than 11 hours of FBI interrogations while he was hospitalized should be admissible. Prosecutors cite several reasons why they needed to question Tsarnaev without reading him his Miranda rights against self-incrimination and without allowing him access to a lawyer. Evidence law enforcement had at the time, they argue, suggested a possible larger conspiracy. FBI agents had ""reason to believe that the Tsarnaevs had accomplices and that they or others might have built additional bombs that posed a continuing danger to public safety."" The note scribbled inside the boat referred to others, saying, ""we are promised victory and we shall surely get it,"" according to Wednesday's motion. Also, a search of the Tsarnaevs' homes failed to uncover traces of the black firework powder used to build the pressure cooker bombs, suggesting that it had been built elsewhere and with help. The Christmas lights used as fuses and the model-car remote control used to detonate the devices also suggested a level of sophistication that suggested terrorist training, prosecutors said. Tsarnaev was lucid while hospitalized and was not coerced into making any of the statements, they argue. According to the court documents, Tsarnaev was questioned about 22 hours after undergoing surgery for multiple gunshot wounds. He had been weaned off the sedative propofol but was still on pain medication. FBI agents questioned him on and off over a nearly 38-hour period, conducting 14 interviews and giving Tsarnaev frequent breaks, including a 10½-hour stretch so he could sleep, the court documents say. Prosecutors say the FBI's interview took time because doctors had performed a tracheostomy to allow greater airflow. Tsarnaev initially answered by nodding or writing in a notebook and then later spoke his answers. Although Tsarnaev denied that anyone else was involved, authorities believed he might be lying or concealing the involvement of others, according to prosecutors. Government officials have maintained that Tsarnaev was questioned under the ""public safety"" exception to the Miranda warnings, which allows for limited questioning of a suspect by law enforcement to determine whether there is imminent danger of an attack. ""The fact that Tsarnaev was in the hospital recovering from bullet wounds does not mean the interview was coercive or that the agents who conducted it did anything wrong,"" the prosecutors' motion says. Tsarnaev, prosecutors allege, wanted to explain the bombings and take credit for them. ""As the note he wrote in Watertown on the inside of the boat reflects, Tsarnaev was eager to take credit for his crimes and 'shed some light' on their meaning. That indeed is a common practice among terrorists,"" the motion says. Tsarnaev's attorneys have said that evidence from the hospital interrogations shouldn't be allowed in court, arguing that he was coerced into making incriminating statements. They argue that the statements were involuntary, that the public safety exception agents used didn't apply to the interrogation and that Tsarnaev's first court appearance was postponed to allow for additional questioning. FBI agents questioned Tsarnaev, his attorneys argue, ""despite the fact that he quickly allayed concerns about any continuing threats to public safety, repeatedly requested a lawyer, and begged to rest as he recovered from emergency surgery and underwent continuing treatment for multiple and serious gunshot wounds."" They also argue that the FBI agents deliberately misled Tsarnaev about his brother's death. Prosecutors say that FBI agents didn't tell Tsarnaev about his brother's death ""or the manner of that death, to spare him emotional trauma.""

"(CNN) -- All 77 NATO service members wounded in a Saturday attack against a coalition base in Afghanistan are U.S. troops, a spokeswoman for the International Security Assistance Force said Sunday. Two Afghan civilians were killed and 25 others also were wounded in the attack, which occurred on the eve of the 10th anniversary of al Qaeda's attack on the United States on 9/11, U.S. Army Sgt. Lindsey Kibler said. None of the injuries is life-threatening, ISAF said, and those wounded are expected to return to duties ""shortly."" The truck bombing took place in the central-east province of Wardak, and those killed were Afghan laborers, said Shahidullah Shahid, the Wardak governor's spokesman. ""This attack was a high-profile attack. It was a pretty significant suicide vehicle bomb,"" Gen. John R. Allen, commander of coalition and U.S. forces in Afghanistan, told CNN's Suzanne Malveaux Sunday. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the assault. NATO's International Security Assistance Force confirmed the attack was carried out by a Taliban suicide bomber. Allen said the attack indicates ""much more what the Taliban are unable to do"" than what they are able to do. ""They have been ejected from the population in so many places around the country that their only ability to influence the battlefield on many occasions is simply to go for a high-profile attack. And that's how we view this particular attack,"" he said. Shahid said three people had died, while NATO said two. NATO also said 77 of its personnel were injured, while the provincial government said only 10 people were injured. It is not uncommon for a local government and NATO to have varying accounts of an attack. The attacker was driving a truck carrying firewood and detonated his explosives at an entry point to the base, ISAF said in a statement. ""Most of the force of the explosion was absorbed by the protective barrier at the outpost entrance and though there were a significant number of injuries ... none is immediately life threatening,"" the statement said. In a video issued by ISAF on Saturday, Allen spoke about the 9/11 anniversary and the long war, saying that while ""there is still much work to be done"" in the fight against Taliban militants, ""we will prevail."" He also praised the troops from the 49 nations serving in the ISAF coalition. The protracted war began just a month after the al Qaeda terror network, sheltered at the time by the ruling Taliban militants, attacked the United States on September 11, 2001. U.S.-led forces kicked off Operation Enduring Freedom in October and ousted the Taliban. Coalition and Afghan troops have been fighting the tenacious Taliban militants in the Afghan-Pakistani region. Allen noted that ""September 11 marks the 10th anniversary of an event that changed the world."" Ever since that day, he said, the troops have crippled insurgents and have honored the victims of terrorism worldwide. He said the coalition is committed to making sure Afghanistan is never again a safe haven for al Qaeda. ""You have helped the Afghan people build their nation, a democratic government and an ever-strengthening security force,"" he said, saying Afghanistan has made advances in security, economic development and governance. The coalition death toll in the war is nearing 2,700, according to a CNN count, with the United States sustaining most of the casualties in Operation Enduring Freedom. August was the deadliest month for U.S. forces in Afghanistan since the conflict began. Seventy-one American troops died in August, topping July 2010, when 65 troops died, according to the CNN tally. The surge in U.S. deaths comes as NATO is drawing down and handing over security control to national forces. Some 10,000 U.S. troops are scheduled to depart by year's end, with all U.S. military personnel out of Afghanistan by the end of 2014. CNN's Joe Sterling, Adam Levine, Matiullah Mati, Claudia Dominguez and Tom Evans contributed to this report.","NEW: All of the injured troops are Americans, an ISAF official says .

"(CNN) -- It seats two people, has a sleek retractable roof and runs on electric power. And its body can be 3D printed in a single piece. Meet the Strati, the concept vehicle that was selected from more than 200 entries as the winner of the 3D Printed Car Design Challenge -- back in mid-April, US-based company Local Motors invited designers from around the world to submit their concepts for a car that can be manufactured using 3D printing. Developed by Italian designer Michele Anoe, the Strati will now form the basis of a car that will be printed out live and assembled from scratch at the International Manufacturing Technology Show in Chicago in September. The judges chose Anoe's design for its compatibility with existing 3D printing technologies and explained it offered ""an excellent balance between innovation, complexity and practicality."" The final prototype will make use of the electric powertrain from a Renault Twizy, but its structural chassis will be printed in one single piece. Elements like the seats, the dashboard, the boot and the bonnet will also be 3D printed during September's show. Anoe won't just see his car brought to life, he'll also receive $5,000 for his winning design. Read this: Is your flying car finally here? Local Motors, a crowd-sourced car maker, has already developed a working model to check the process and has also released a video of its first test drive. ""It look us less than 40 hours to print one car and less than four days to assemble the first prototype which is an unbelievably short amount of time,"" says Jay Rogers, chief executive of Local Motors, which has been building off-road desert racers and electric-powered drift trikes for seven years now. ""By the end of this summer it will be less than 20 hours of printing, and we believe we can get it down to less than an hour of assembly by two people -- what this means is that is really the first production 3D printed car when you can reach those numbers,"" he continues. ""Our goal in the end is to be radically different about the creation of cars; we sort of commonly say a car today is over 20,000 parts -- we would like cars of the future to have less than 20 parts."" Six additional entries were also recognized and their designers received awarded with $1,000.

"Bloodstained pavement, a woman's compact, a pair of shattered spectacles, a single shoe covered in dust were among the debris left by a devastating series of explosions that hit the headquarters of the pro-Russian separatists in the eastern Ukrainian city of Luhansk on Monday. The carnage was sudden, unexpected. This was the middle of a city, a building adjacent to a leafy square, where civilians walked and worked. Eight people were killed, five women and three men, according to the self-declared Luhansk People's Republic; the authorities in Kiev reported the same tally. But there the agreement ends. The pro-Russian leadership in the city immediately accused the Ukrainian air force of carrying out the attack. A fighter jet had been flying overhead at the time, and social media video appeared to show it firing cannon or rockets. The authorities in Kiev denied its planes had been involved. Initially, the anti-terrorist operation said the explosion originated from inside the building, then that an anti-aircraft missile operated by the separatists had misfired, reacting to heat from an air-conditioning system on the outside of the building. But a CNN investigation in Luhansk has found clear evidence that whatever detonations hit the building and the adjoining park came from the air. The tops of trees were splintered, and a series of small craters -- about a dozen -- had been blasted in a straight line, starting in the park and reaching the walls of the building, blowing out many of its windows and spraying the area with jagged shrapnel. That's what appears to have killed most of the victims and injured 20 more. The pattern of the craters clearly indicated some sort of strafing, according to a munitions expert at the scene with CNN. Their size suggested 30-millimeter ordnance, he said, which is standard equipment on the Su-25, a ground attack fighter, and the Su-27 -- both combat aircraft operated by Ukraine. The Special Monitoring Mission of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe came to a similar conclusion, releasing a statement late Tuesday that said: ""Based on the SMM's limited observation, these strikes were the result of non-guided rockets shot from an aircraft."" It's thought to be the first time that civilians have been killed or injured in an attack by the Ukrainian air force since pro-Russian groups began occupying buildings in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions more than two months ago. The self-declared prime-minister of the People's Republic of Luhansk, Vasily Nikitin, told CNN he hoped the attack would spur Russian President Vladimir Putin to action. ""We appealed to Russia to send us peacekeepers. I think after they see what happened to us in the center of our town, they'll send them more quickly,"" he said. Nikitin said he was ready to provide all the evidence collected to independent experts. Nick de Larrinaga, Europe editor of IHS Jane's Defence Weekly, told CNN he believed the Ukrainian air force ""used their Su-25 'Frogfoot' ground attack aircraft during the operation in Luhansk. It is specifically designed for attacking ground targets -- unlike the Su-27, which is principally a fighter aircraft."" The planes were flying to provide support for a base of the Ukrainian Border Guard on the edge of the city. Why one may have targeted the administrative building, several miles away, is unknown. The Border Guard compound, in a southern suburb of Luhansk, came under attack before dawn Monday. It was a concerted assault from several directions, involving hundreds of pro-Russian militants, and continued for some 12 hours. On a visit to the site Tuesday, a CNN team found dozens of spent cartridges in several locations around the base, whose buildings had also been hit by rocket-propelled grenades. Part of the roof of the main building hung precariously in the strong wind. Vehicles outside had been burned out, the fuel dump blown up. By late afternoon, only a token force of separatists were still in place, using blocks of apartments within 100 meters of the base as protection. They cradled brand new assault rifles and carried boxes of ammunition but insisted they were local men. Patches of dried blood marked the place where one of several militants killed or wounded Monday had been hit by gunfire from the base. One of the separatists, who gave his name as Oleg, said, ""They call this an anti-terror operation, but it's wrong. When they use air force against their own people, it's wrong."" He dismissed Ukraine's President-elect, Petro Poroshenko, as ""illegitimate."" Oleg and other fighters said the base had been attacked because it was the hub for Ukrainian patrols along a several-hundred-kilometer stretch of the nearby border with Russia -- an area that has seen increased infiltration by Russian militants and weapons in recent weeks. Several soldiers inside the compound were also injured in the clashes, and windows in the adjoining apartment blocks were pock-marked with bullet holes. As CNN filmed, two men raced into the base through its charred gate-house. The battle for eastern Ukraine is intensifying. The casualties are rising, as are the number of pro-Russian separatists and the roadblocks dotted throughout the region. And in some areas, the only obvious presence of the Ukrainian state is in the sky.","Five women and three men were killed in explosions at pro-Russian building in Luhansk .

"It's the latest cruel tactic in the Pakistani Taliban's battle to stop girls and women from getting an education: acid thrown in their faces to scar them for life and deter others from following in their footsteps. A doctor who treated the victims of an acid attack on a college van in the city of Parachinar in northern Pakistan last month told CNN that two girls had been left with severe burns to their faces. The Pakistani Taliban have taken responsibility for the attack in threatening pamphlets distributed around the city. They also warn local girls against going to school, Dr. Shaban Ali said. ""We will never allow the girls of this area to go and get a Western education,"" said Qari Muhavia, the local Pakistani Taliban leader, when contacted by CNN by telephone. Who are the Pakistani Taliban? ""If and when we find any girl from Parachinar going to university for an education we will target her (in) the same way, so that she might not be able to unveil her face before others,"" Muhavia said. The Pakistani Taiban's violent campaign to stop girls from getting an education was brought to international attention early last month when gunmen in the Swat Valley attacked another van, this time carrying schoolgirl education activist Malala Yousufzai. She is in a British hospital recovering from a gunshot to the head. Shahab Uddin, a local government official from Kurram Agency in Pakistan's northern tribal belt, said the acid attack was the latest method used to terrorize young girls and deter them from going to school. Fifteen students, boys and girls, from Kohat University were on their way home to Parachinar when unknown ""extremists"" stopped the vehicle and threw acid at the girls and shot one of the boys, according to Uddin. Two girls, Zahida and Nabila, and one more boy had suffered burns, Uddin said, while Mohammad Ali, a fourth boy, was the student who was shot. ""After throwing acid on the students the assailants opened fire on the van,"" Uddin said. He said the girls who were targeted ""are alive and out of danger now, but their faces are badly scarred."" Ali, of the district headquarters hospital, confirmed that four students were brought into the emergency room for treatment, three with acid burns and one with a bullet wound. ""We are all graduate students studying in the master's program, and we were coming back home after taking our exams,"" one of the girls who was targeted told CNN under condition of anonymity. ""We don't know who the attackers were, but when our vehicle reached Doranai they stopped us and threw acid on our faces ... now we are scared of going back to our studies,"" said another girl, who also asked not to be named because she didn't have permission from her family to speak. Malala is face of global attacks on schools . ""Other passengers who were sitting in the vehicle were also wounded, but they were not as serious as Zahida and Nabila,"" she said. Acid throwing is frequently used as a weapon in Pakistan to punish women for acts that allegedly bring dishonor to the family, or just to enact revenge. Another recent acid attack in Pakistan resulted in the death of a 15-year-old girl, Anwasha. She was allegedly attacked by her parents for engaging in illicit relations with a boy, according to Tahir Ayub, a senior police official. The 15-year-old girl suffered severe burns on her face and chest, but her parents initially refused to get her medical help, Ayub said. She was eventually taken to a hospital a day later and died from her injuries. ""Her father said she wasn't coming to her senses so the parents threw acid on her to save their honor,"" Ayub told CNN. Anwasha's mother claimed she had seen the boy and girl secretly meet and had seen her frequently speaking on a cell phone, Ayub said. The parents, who live in a suburban village outside the Kashmiri city of Muzaffarabad, are in police custody, Ayub said. The Taliban in Afghanistan also have used acid attacks against girls to discourage them from going to school. The victims are left to cope with a disfigurement that is shameful in their culture and is likely to impact their ability to have a husband and family.

More than 210,000 people complain to the Federal Trade Commission monthly about robocalls, those annoying and frustrating illegal automated messages.

That was before the FTC announced last October it was launching a nationwide contest to get the public's help in solving a difficult problem. Nearly 800 eligible submissions were received and two winners were announced on Tuesday. Serdar Danis and Aaron Foss will each receive $25,000 for their ""real breakthrough solutions"" which focus on ""intercepting and filtering out illegal prerecorded calls,"" according to the FTC. The prize money will come from last year's agency funds. They will use technology to ""blacklist"" robocaller phone numbers and ""whitelist"" numbers associated with acceptable incoming calls. ""We're hoping these winning proposals find their way to the marketplace soon, and will provide relief to millions of American consumers harassed by these calls,"" said Charles Harwood, acting director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. The agency doesn't endorse either winner, but encourages the private sector to reach out to Danis and Foss to develop their proposals. Foss's idea is called Nomorobo. It is a ""cloud-based solution that would use 'simultaneous ringing,' which allows incoming calls to be routed to a second telephone line. This second line would identify and hang up on illegal robocalls before they could ring through to the user,""  explained Harwood. Danis's proposal, if nothing else, probably deserved an award for the longest name. His winning entry was titled, ""Robocall Filtering System and Device with Autonomous Blacklisting, Whitelisting, Graylisting and Caller ID Spoof Detection."" It would ""analyze and block robocalls using software that could be implemented as a mobile app, an electronic device in a user's home or a feature of a provider's telephone service."" Additionally, the FTC handed out a non-monetary prize to Google for a robo challenge achievement award. The judges considered whether an idea would work, was easy to use and could be rolled out for production. More than 217 million Americans have joined the National Do-Not-Call Registry since June 2003. But that hasn't guaranteed calls will stop. Many companies are using autodial technology that's capable of sending out thousands of calls a minute. ""Many calls get through the system,"" Harwood said. ""Even if someone is not on the Do-Not-Call Registry, it's still illegal to place calls without expressed written authorization.""","Federal agency launched competition to find a solution to nagging, automated calls .

"Tampa, Florida (CNN) -- With Texas Gov. Rick Perry threatening to cement his standing atop the national polls, his rivals for the Republican presidential nomination aggressively sought to undermine his conservative credentials on Monday during the first-ever CNN/Tea Party debate in Florida. Perry repeatedly found himself in the crosshairs, as the field of candidates took turns attacking his positions on illegal immigration, Social Security, and his controversial 2007 push to vaccinate Texas schoolgirls against human papillomavirus, a common sexually transmitted disease that can lead to cervical cancer. Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann, whose standing among Republicans has slipped dramatically since Perry entered the race, said she was ""offended"" by Perry's executive order, which included an opt-out provision for parents who did not want the vaccine. ""To have innocent little 12 year old girls to be forced to have government injections through an executive order is just flat-out wrong,"" Bachmann said. Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum -- like Bachmann, a staunch social conservative struggling to gain traction in the polls -- also pounced. ""This is big government run amok,"" Santorum said to applause. ""It is bad policy and it should not have been done."" Perry said he regretted his decision to push for the vaccine using an executive order, but said he was standing up against cancer. ""At the end of the day I am always going to err on the side of life,"" Perry said. ""At the end of the day this was about trying to solve cancer."" Perry was also attacked by his opponents for signing the Texas DREAM Act in 2001, which granted in-state tuition to some children of illegal immigrants. And former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney chided Perry for referring to Social Security as a ""Ponzi scheme"" and vowed to protect the program. Romney called such language ""over the top"" and said that Perry wrote in his book ""Fed Up!"" that the entitlement program is unconstitutional. Perry said Romney is trying to ""scare"" seniors who rely on the federal program. When Romney persisted on the constitutionality question, Perry said the nation needed to have a serious conversation on the issue, which prompted Romney to cut him off by saying ""we're having that conversation right now, governor."" Other candidates then joined in, with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich earning applause from the crowd of conservative tea party supporters by saying the issue wasn't about who was scaring senior citizens when, he said, President Barack Obama was scaring the nation every day. Bachmann and Perry squared off on the vaccination situation, with Bachmann saying, ""We cannot forget that in the midst of this executive order there's a big drug company that made millions of dollars because of this."" She added that a former Perry aide was a lobbyist for the company and asked if the issue was about saving lives or money. Perry responded that the company, Merck, made a $5,000 contribution and said to Bachmann: ""If you're saying I can be bought for $5,000, I'm offended."" ""I'm offended by what happened to all those girls, "" Bachmann said of the required vaccination of girls as young as 12 against cervical cancer. Perry also said that the executive order was a mistake and he should have worked with the legislature instead of issuing it. He also noted the order gave parents the right to opt their children out of the vaccination. The debate at the Florida State Fairgrounds in Tampa gave the other candidates on the stage a chance to change what many are portraying as a two-person race between Perry and Romney. CNN and the Tea Party Express, a leading national tea party organization, teamed up to put on the event, with questions coming from the moderator, CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer, as well as from tea party activists, supporters in the audience and voters at locations in Arizona, Ohio and Virginia. Participants included Perry, Romney, Bachmann, Gingrich, Santorum, Texas Rep. Ron Paul, former Utah Gov. and former U.S. Ambassador to China Jon Huntsman and former Godfather's Pizza CEO Herman Cain. Perry, the new guy in the race and the current front-runner in the national polls, and Romney, the previous front-runner in the GOP battle, sparred over jobs and Social Security at a debate last week at the Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California. They continued the battle Monday. When Blitzer noted Perry's success creating jobs in Texas, Romney cited what he called advantages to accomplishing such success in that state, including no income tax, lots of oil and a Republican-controlled state legislature. ""If you're dealt four aces, that doesn't necessarily make you a great poker player,"" Romney said in the best zinger of the early going. If voters believe all of America is like Texas, then they should choose someone with success in Texas, Romney continued, adding that if voters believe the nation needs to be turned around, ""that's what I do."" Perry responded to Romney: ""You were doing pretty good until you got to talking poker."" In the California debate last week, Perry stood by earlier comments that Social Security is a ""Ponzi scheme"" and that it was a ""monstrous lie"" to tell young workers that the 74-year-old pension system would be there when they retire. Romney fired back, saying that ""under no circumstances would I ever say by any measure it's a failure. It is working for millions of Americans, and I'll keep it working for millions of Americans."" Since then, both candidates have swung at each other through e-mail and social media. In a radio interview, Romney went a step further. ""If we nominate someone who the Democrats can correctly characterize as being opposed to Social Security, we would be obliterated as a party,"" he said. Perry's team fired back, noting that in Romney's policy book ""No Apology,"" the former Massachusetts governor compared the management of Social Security to a felony. When that issue came up Monday, Romney said Perry was misquoting him from the book. As for Romney's charge that Perry would possibly abolish the popular government program, Perry's team says that the Texas governor believes that Social Security must be protected for current beneficiaries and those nearing retirement age. In a a USA Today op-ed released Monday by Perry, he declined to use the phrase ""Ponzi scheme"" but called for a ""frank, honest national conversation about fixing Social Security to protect benefits for those at or near retirement while keeping faith with younger generations, who are being asked to pay."" Bachmann, who is vying for tea party support with Perry, also has tried to inject herself into the Social Security discussion. Monday's debate was crucial to Bachmann, who has dropped in national polling since Perry launched his campaign on August 13, the very same day that she won a crucial straw poll in Ames, Iowa.

"Russian special forces killed five suspected militants and took another into custody Saturday during an assault on a house in the volatile Caucasus republic of Dagestan, a Russian security source told CNN. Russia launched a search for anti-government militants in the run-up to the Winter Olympics in Sochi. The group's alleged leader, Alexei Pashentsev, was among those killed, the source said. Pashentsev is a man of Russian ethnic origin who converted to the Islamic faith in 2010 and began contacts with militant groups, the source said. The six suspects were in a house in the republic's capital city of Makhachkala, the source said. They were connected to the Buynaksk militant group, which had previously been linked to other militants behind bombings in late December in Volgograd in southwestern Russia, the source said. It was not clear if any of the suspects were involved in the twin bombing attacks -- one on the city's main train station and the second, carried out within a day, on a trolley bus. In all, 34 people were killed in the attacks and approximately 100 others were wounded. On Wednesday, state media reported that a suspected mastermind of the twin attacks was killed in a police operation in Dagestan. The man died in a shootout at a house in the town of Izberbash, the official Itar-Tass news agency said. One accomplice surrendered to police, but others were killed alongside the suspected mastermind, the news agency said. The attacks on Volgograd's public transit system fueled security concerns ahead of the Sochi games. Two other people were arrested last week on suspicion of transporting the suicide bombers to Volgograd. Russian security forces have carried out a number of operations in Dagestan in recent weeks. The southern republic is the hotbed of an ongoing Islamist insurgency blamed for previous terrorist attacks in Russia.","Source: Russian special forces kill 5 suspected militants, take 1 into custody .

"Which Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post for $250 million? Was it the Bezos who helped recover two Apollo-era F-1 engines from the bottom of the Atlantic ocean this spring? A savior capable of raising rusted heaps out of their watery graves? Was it the Bezos who's sunk $42 million into the ""Clock of the Long Now,"" a timepiece that will run for 10,000 years entombed inside a man-made cavern carved into the top of a mountain outside of Ely, Nevada? An eccentric billionaire who'll drop vast amounts of money into, well, a hole in the ground? Was it the Bezos who founded Amazon, the biggest store in the world, a company that has both transformed and trampled nearly every formerly brick-and-mortar industry it has entered, from books to shoes and beyond? Or was it the Bezos whose personal investments -- in companies like Twitter, Airbnb, Makerbot, Uber and many others -- demonstrate an innate understanding of the shifting trends of the web? Each one of those Jeff Bezoses would do interesting things to the Washington Post (well, maybe not the crazy mountain clock guy). But as someone who spends every day thinking about the intersection of journalism and technology, I hope it was the Jeff Bezos who shepherded AWS -- Amazon Web Services -- into being. Unless you build things on the Internet, you've probably never heard of AWS. That's because AWS is in one of the world's least sexy businesses: server and computational infrastructure. AWS began as a commerce problem. Amazon needed a massive server cloud for the holiday shopping season but only a fraction of it for the rest of the year. That means a lot of expensive servers would be sitting idle to make sure your Christmas presents don't get hung up when you press ""purchase."" So the idea hatched that those idle computer servers could be rented out to other companies. It worked. Now, when you watch a movie streamed from Netflix, you're using AWS. When you check out your friend's picture on Instagram, read a blog on Tumblr, pin something on Pinterest, you're accessing AWS. Reddit, the ""front page of the Internet""? That's built on AWS. The infrastructure of the Obama for America re-election campaign -- vaunted as the most technically sophisticated campaign in history -- relied on AWS, too. The size, scale and impact of the AWS server cloud is massive and growing. AWS is one of the most transformative and oft-overlooked technologies of the last decade. And it started as little more than a ""hare-brained scheme,"" as Benjamin Black, one of the original drafters of the technology, described it in 2009. AWS is about as ""all of the buffalo"" as you get in technology: Use every part of the tech stack so that your servers are always in use, either by you or by others. With AWS, Bezos found value in every part of the process. He looked at risks and embraced ""hare-brained"" experiments. He saw opportunity in extending Amazon technology externally, not just keeping it all in-house (AWS serves the streaming movies of Amazon's competitor Netflix just as efficiently as it serves its own). Similar to the creation of AWS, journalism has its done its share of invention and experiments that have transformed the Web. Django, a Web framework used by companies like Pinterest and Instagram, got its start in the newsroom of the Lawrence Journal-World. Backbone, a Javascript library that powers sites like Hulu and Pandora, was created as part of the Document Cloud project at the New York Times. These newsroom technologies and others like them are transformational not just to journalism but to the entire Web the same way AWS doesn't power only Amazon. These spinoffs, these ""hare-brained"" ideas, these bits and pieces of code that start in the newsroom and end transforming the Web itself, are what technologists in journalism do best when they have the right support and leadership behind them. That leadership is still too rare in the journalism industry. That may have changed in a big way on Monday. In a letter written to Washington Post employees, Bezos says that, moving forward, ""we will need to invent, which means we will need to experiment."" Let's do it.","Amazon.com's Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post for $250 million .

"In one video, the captain of the sinking South Korean ferry scrambles to safety. In another, stranded passengers panic. ""Wow, it's tilting a lot. We're tilting to this side. Can't move,"" one says. ""You think I'm really going to die?"" another cries. The two recordings fueled fresh outrage Monday over the Sewol ferry's sinking as questions swirled over why so many perished in the disaster while many members of the ship's crew survived. The video capturing passengers' panic was recorded by a teenage boy on the vessel, according to South Korean national TV network JTBC. The teen's father gave the network the footage after authorities recovered his son's body and found the cell phone. Its memory card was still intact, JTBC reported. The network shared a roughly three-minute audio clip of the video with CNN, which translated the exchanges. The clip provides a horrifying glimpse into the uncertainty and desperation inside the ferry as it rolled. Meanwhile, outside the ferry, rescuers were circling, a video released by South Korea's coast guard shows. The video shows the coast guard's rescue of Lee Joon-seok, the ship's captain, who scrambles off the stricken vessel in his underwear. Speaking out about it for the first time on Monday, the men who rescued him said they had no idea who he was until later. ""During the rescue operation, people were just dropping in the sea,"" South Korean coast guard Capt. Kim Kyung Il told reporters. ""Everyone was wearing a life vest, so we couldn't tell who was passenger, and who was crew."" Arrests and an investigation . Many South Koreans have lambasted the government's response to the disaster, saying it has been too slow. South Korean authorities are pressing a criminal investigation. The ship's captain and 14 others have been arrested. Prosecutors in Mokpo, who are leading the ferry investigation, told CNN that all 15 crew members responsible for sailing as well as the engine room face charges and are being held in Mokpo prison. Authorities also arrested three people Monday on suspicion of destroying evidence connected to the sinking of the ferry. On Sunday, South Korea's Prime Minister announced his resignation, saying he wants to take responsibility for the initial reaction to the disaster. Chung Hong-won apologized ""on behalf of the government for the many problems that arose during the first response and the subsequent rescue operation"" in addition to ""problems that existed before the accident."" While political fallout occurs, the father of the boy who shot the cell phone video is beside himself with grief. ""My son, it must have been cold and dark where you were,"" said Park Jong-dae, weeping as he read a statement on JTBC. ""How much you must have been cold and afraid? ""I hoped and prayed for your survival, but it didn't turn out that way. My son, now it's time for us to say goodbye. It's time for you and me to say goodbye and for me to let go of the hope that I could not let go so far. Please forgive me. Farewell. ..."" Images of ferry captain abandoning ship are shocking . Confusion and a warning to stay put . On Monday, searchers continued to look for passengers and crew, and so far have retrieved 193 bodies. Another 109 people are still missing. The fate of those seen and heard on the video is not known. Coast guard officials told reporters on Monday that when they arrived at the site of the shipwreck, the ferry was listing so badly that they immediately sounded their alarm. ""When we got there, we used our speakers to tell everyone to get off the boat and get into the water,"" Kim said. At some point inside the ferry, passengers -- including 300 students on a school field trip -- apparently heard a different message. In the audio recording provided by JTBC, a voice on a public address system warns that everyone should stay where they are: ""Do not move from your present location and please stay. ..."" Ferry disaster's toll on South Korea's national psyche . While some seem confused, there are people who appear to joke around, clearly not fully comprehending the gravity of what's happening. At one point a voice is heard saying, ""This trip is screwed."" Others seem more distressed by the situation and ask about life jackets. ""Mom, dad, dad, dad! What about my younger sibling?"" one cries. Some passengers talk to one another, trying to reassure and inform. Another voice says, ""I think it's calming down."" Then: ""Is it calming down?"" ""It's going more to the left."" ""I think it's better than it was before."" ""I'm wearing the life vest."" ""I'm wearing one, too. I really have to."" ""I have to wear one, too."" Some appear to try to help others. One shouts, ""Hey!"" then says the name of someone who doesn't have a life jacket. ""We need to get one!"" As the video continues, it seems that no one knows what's really happening. ""What's the captain doing?"" one person asks. Later, a voice is heard saying, ""They should let us know what's going on.""

"Washington (CNN) -- A political standoff that spanned five decades and 10 presidents began to crumble Wednesday with President Barack Obama's move to normalize relations with Cuba. The announcement was the product of a year of clandestine back-channelling between the U.S. and Cuba, facilitated by the Canadians and the Vatican and with personal involvement from the Pope. ""Today, America chooses to cut loose the shackles of the past, so as to reach for a better future for the Cuban people, for the American people, for our entire hemisphere and for the world,"" Obama said in a statement announcing his decision. He added: ""It's time for a new approach."" Obama said he's instructed Secretary of State John Kerry to immediately begin discussions with Cuba to re-establish diplomatic relations, and that the U.S. will re-open an embassy in Havana. The administration will also allow some travel and trade that had been banned under a decades-long embargo instated during the Kennedy administration. ""Neither the American nor Cuban people are well-served by a rigid policy that's rooted in events that took place before most of us were born,"" Obama said. Obama's move risks triggering another fight with Congress, which will come under the full control of Republicans in January. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer he would do everything in his power to block any potential U.S. ambassador to Cuba even receive a vote. He also called the easing of economic restrictions ""inexplicable"" in a statement. ""Appeasing the Castro brothers will only cause other tyrants from Caracas to Tehran to Pyongyang to see that they can take advantage of President Obama's naiveté during his final two years in office. As a result, America will be less safe as a result of the President's change in policy,"" he said. Rubio promised that as the incoming chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's Western Hemisphere subcommittee, he'll ""make every effort to block this dangerous and desperate attempt by the President to burnish his legacy at the Cuban people's [sic] expense."" RELATED: Five reasons why the Cuba deal happened . Speaking at the same time as Obama from his own country, Cuban President Raul Castro lauded the move. ""This expression by President Barack Obama deserves the respect and recognition by all the people and I want to thank and recognize support from the Vatican and especially from Pope Francis for the improvement of relations between Cuba and the United States,"" he said. Obama's announcement comes as both nations have released political prisoners in a show of goodwill, with American Alan Gross headed home on ""humanitarian"" grounds from Cuba early Wednesday morning. In a separate swap, a U.S. intelligence source held for 20 years was released in exchange for three jailed Cuban spies. Obama said he and Castro spoke Tuesday in a phone call that lasted about an hour and reflected the first communication at the presidential level with Cuba since the Cuban revolution. But some Republicans are warning the move will only strengthen the Castro regime in Cuba, which has long been accused of human rights abuses and is listed by the State Department as a state sponsor of terrorism. Obama said Wednesday he has instructed Kerry, however, to review Cuba's place on the State Sponsors of Terrorism list. Wednesday's announcement that the U.S. will move toward restoring diplomatic ties with Cuba will also make it easier for Americans to travel to Cuba and do business with the Cuban people by extending general licenses, officials said. While the more liberal travel restrictions won't allow for tourism, they will permit greater American travel to the island. While only Congress can formally overturn the five decades-long embargo, the White House has some authorities to liberalize trade and travel to the island. And Obama said he plans to ""engage Congress in an honest and serious conversation"" on lifting it. In an effort to boost the nascent Cuban private sector, the President will also allow expanded commercial sales and exports of goods and services to Cuba, particularly building materials for entrepreneurs and private residences, and allow greater business training, as well as permit greater communications hardware and services to go to the island. Other announced changes permit U.S. and Cuban banks to build relationships and travelers to use credit and debit cards. U.S. travelers will be allowed to import up to $400 worth of goods from Cuba, including $100 in alcohol and tobacco -- even Cuban cigars. Remittances by Americans to their families back in Cuba will also be increased to approximately $2,000 per quarter. Senior administration officials and Cuba observers have said recent reforms on the island and changing attitudes in the United States have created an opening for improved relations. U.S. and Cuban officials say Washington and Havana in recent months have increased official technical-level contacts on a variety of issues. RELATED: Five reasons why the Cuba deal happened . Both Obama and Castro in their Wednesday remarks acknowledged the nations' differences remain. ""I do not expect the changes I am announcing today to bring about a transformation of Cuban society overnight,"" Obama said. But he argued that ""through a policy of engagement, we can more effectively stand up for our values, and help the Cuban people help themselves as they move into the 21st century."" Castro said that even as the two nations ""recognize having profound differences — especially in national sovereignty, democracy, human rights and foreign relations policies — we reaffirm our willingness to dialogue in all of these area."" To that end, Cuba has agreed to release 53 political prisoners from a list of names provided by the United States. At least one of the prisoners has already been released. Havana has also agreed to permit significant access by its citizens to the Internet and allow the International Committee of the Red Cross and United Nations human rights officials back on the island for the first time in years. Talks between the U.S. and Cuba have been ongoing since June of 2013 and were facilitated by the Canadians and the Vatican in brokering the deal. Pope Francis — the first pope from Latin America — encouraged Obama in a letter and in their meeting this year to renew talks with Cuba on pursuing a closer relationship. Gross' release was seen as one of the first clear benefits of those talks. Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., and Rep. Chris Van Hollen, Gross' Maryland congressman, left Washington at 4 a.m. Wednesday for Cuba, and returned with Gross and his wife, Judy, according to government officials. Gross, speaking at a press conference Wednesday, said he's ""very happy"" with Obama's moves, and heaped praise on the people of Cuba, ""or at least most of them."" ""It pains me to see them treated so unjustly as a consequence of two governments' mutually belligerent policies,"" he said. ""Five-and-a-half decades of history shows us that such belligerence inhibits better judgment. Two wrongs don't make a right."" Gross was arrested after traveling under a program under the U.S. Agency for International Development to deliver satellite phones and other communications equipment to the island's small Jewish population. Cuban officials charged he was trying to foment a ""Cuban Spring."" In 2011, he was convicted and sentenced to 15 years in prison for attempting to set up an Internet network for Cuban dissidents ""to promote destabilizing activities and subvert constitutional order."" Gross' lawyer, Scott Gilbert, told CNN last month the years of confinement have taken their toll on his client. Gross has lost more than 100 pounds and is losing his teeth. His hips are so weak that he can barely walk and he has lost vision in one eye. He has also undertaken hunger strikes and threatened to take his own life. With Gross' health in decline, a bipartisan group of 66 senators wrote Obama a letter in November 2013 urging him to ""act expeditiously to take whatever steps are in the national interest to obtain [Gross's] release."" The three Cubans released as a part of the deal belonged the so-called Cuban Five, a quintet of Cuban intelligence officers convicted in 2001 for espionage. They were part of what was called the Wasp Network, which collected intelligence on prominent Cuban-American exile leaders and U.S. military bases. The leader of the five, Gerardo Hernandez, was linked to the February 1996 downing of the two civilian planes operated by the U.S.-based dissident group Brothers to the Rescue, in which four men died. He is serving a two life sentences. Luis Medina, also known as Ramon Labanino; and Antonio Guerrero have just a few years left on their sentences. The remaining two — Rene Gonzalez and Fernando Gonzalez — were released after serving most of their 15-year sentences and have already returned to Cuba, where they were hailed as heroes.

"(CNN)Katherine Kuczynski was a cryptologic technician in the U.S. Navy. The post required obtaining and maintaining security clearance and performing tasks in support of national intelligence-gathering efforts, with an emphasis on cryptology, she told me. Her work earned her a Joint Service Achievement Medal for ""exceptionally meritorious achievement,"" explained Kuczynski, of New Baltimore, Michigan. And yet the single mother of three children, now 12, 11 and 9, found herself unemployed numerous times during the past several years. Since leaving the military in 2003, she has held jobs ranging from home improvement to store clerk to security guard. Kuczynski's experience is, sadly, all too familiar to veterans, especially women who served. The unemployment rate for female veterans who have been discharged since September 11, 2001, was 9.3% in 2013, versus about 8% for male vets, according to a report from the Disabled American Veterans. The difference in unemployment between female and male veterans is even more dramatic when you consider veterans of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan: For women, the rate was 11.2% last month, 5 points higher than it was for men, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 5 ways to honor veterans beyond Veteran's Day . ""Women veterans are still having a harder time finding jobs than their male counterparts,"" first lady Michelle Obama said at a White House event Monday designed to put a spotlight on the issue. But why? We don't have a definitive answer, but here are some possible contributing factors. One-quarter of female service members are married to other service members, and military spousal unemployment rates are five times higher than those of other women in their peer group, according to Col. Steve Parker, executive director of Joining Forces, the joint initiative from Obama and Jill Biden to support military families. The transient nature of being a military spouse, sometimes moving every two or three years, makes it very difficult to get a new job. Female veterans also don't ""all readily identify themselves as veterans,"" Parker said. ""We've got a number of preferential efforts going to hire veterans, but you have women veterans in some cases who are opting out of using that on their resume,"" he added. Also, there are fewer health services in the Department of Veterans Affairs specifically designed for female veterans; some question whether that impacts their ability to successfully transition from the military. For instance, a third of VA medical centers don't have a gynecologist on staff. Almost one-third of VA clinics don't have the staff to provide the necessary treatment to the one in five female veterans who say they experienced sexual trauma in the military, according to the report from the Disabled American Veterans. Currently, 14.5% of the 1.4 million active military members are women. At an event Monday for Joining Forces, the first lady addressed an audience of female service members, including many who are still looking for work. ""The fact that any of you are worrying about where your next paycheck is going to come from or struggling to put food on the table -- that should be appalling to all of us as Americans,"" Obama said. When they can't find jobs, the effects extend far beyond the veterans themselves. ""The average male veteran is single, but the average female veteran is a parent, if not a spouse. So you've got a family dynamic that's impacted negatively when they're unemployed ... so this is one of our more vulnerable populations,"" Parker said. ""If we want take care of veterans and families, we've got to focus on female veterans."" 5 things you may not know about post-traumatic stress . The first lady, who made the issue of female veterans' unemployment the centerpiece of an interview with Redbook for its November issue, touted a number of new commitments from major companies. LinkedIn is helping veterans import their profiles onto the relatively new Veterans Employment Center website, which has more than a million job postings for positions in the public and private sectors. The company is also offering veterans a free one-year subscription to all of its premium job-seeker tools. Online educational platform Coursera is providing all veterans with one free verified certificate for select courses in high-demand fields ranging from data science to cybersecurity and health care. Some industries are also stepping up efforts to recruit female veterans directly, such as the sheet metal and air conditioning industry. Leah Rambo, director of training for the Local 28 Sheet Metal Apprenticeship Program, which covers New York and parts of Long Island, often makes sure a female veteran is on hand at military job fairs. ""The truth is, women don't apply, and oftentimes, minorities don't apply, because they simply don't know it's available (and) don't know they can do it, and the easiest way to dispel that is just to put someone there that looks like you,"" she said. During the most recent recruitment period in July, 7% of the veterans who applied were women -- a number that has been steadily going up, Rambo said. Thank you for your service, vets! Now try finding a job . Kuczynski, the Navy veteran, got interested in the sheet metal trade when her grandfather introduced her to it as a kid. ""I remember him coming home from work and telling me that I could do anything a boy could do, if not better, and I really took that to heart,"" she said. She decided to pursue a career in the industry and is currently a journeyman sheet metal worker, which involves assembling, installing and repairing sheet metal equipment products and structures. ""As a former military person, I thought this would be a great fit ... because the military grooms you to be a leader. Further, I thought it would be a great job to raise three children on my own."" She applauds efforts by the International Training Institute, the education arm of the sheet metal and air conditioning industry, to actively target female veterans. Said Rambo, ""There's no reason why a person risked life and limb and then (does) not have a job afterward. To me, it's kind of the least that you can do.""

"CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN)  -- One of Chicago's most well-known real estate moguls appears to have shot himself to death, police said. Steven Good was found dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot Monday, police said. The body of Steven L. Good was found in his Jaguar on Monday. The car was spotted in a parking lot of a wildlife preserve in Kane County, Illinois, just outside Chicago, authorities said. No note was found, and police say they do not know how long the 52-year-old had been in the vehicle. Good was the chairman and chief executive officer of Sheldon Good & Co., a major U.S. real estate auction company. The death comes amid great turmoil in the country's real estate industry. In his role as chairman of the Realtors Commercial Alliance Committee, Good commented on tough conditions last month at a business conference. On a memorial blog set up by the Chicago Association of Realtors, for which Good once served as president, friends and colleagues described him as a gregarious man with a big personality. He was a savvy businessman who built his company into a major national real estate company that did deals with Donald Trump, they said. ""It is testimony to Steve's leadership that Sheldon Good & Co. remains well-positioned for the future,"" said Sheldon Good President Alan R. Kravets. ""The guy was a true blue Realtor,"" said Barbara Matthopoulos, the association's spokeswoman. She was new to real estate when she met Good more than a year ago. He took time to give her advice that has helped her grow to love the business. ""Anybody who knew him would speak to his leadership, his generosity, his attitude. The guy was just very positive, always smiling, always telling you a story. He was engaged. Everyone is really very shocked,"" she said. ""I doubt anyone could help explain why this happened."" Kane County Sheriff's Department spokesman Lt. Pat Gengler said authorities don't have any ""concrete evidence if this had anything to do with his finances."" The company was founded by Good's father, Sheldon Good, in 1965, according to the firm's Web site. Steven Good had ""been involved in the sale of more than $4 billion of real estate, including commercial, office, retail, industrial, residential, and vacant land sites,"" it says. ""Mr. Good is the driving force behind the expansion of the company, which has been ranked as the largest firm in the United States exclusively conducting real estate auctions."" Good, who was also an attorney, wrote a book, ""Churches, Jails and Gold Mines: Mega-Deals From a Real Estate Maverick."" According to Amazon.com, Donald Trump wrote the afterword. The first chapter begins, ""Our auction company is to the real estate business what Sotheby's and Christie's is the fine art and collectibles business."" The book goes to say that as of its 2003 publication, the firm had sold 40,000 properties totaling $8 billion. ""If you lined up 1,000 people and said pick the one that might do this to themselves, he would be the last person I would choose,"" said Wayne Caplan, who worked at Sheldon Good for six years and knew Steven Good personally. ""He had a zest for life. He has a wife and kids and he had so much in his life.""","Steven L. Good was found dead of an apparent gunshot wound in his car Monday .

"Orlando, Florida (CNN)  -- A former astronaut who was accused of assaulting a romantic rival in the parking lot of the Orlando airport will avoid prison after pleading guilty to lesser charges as part of a plea agreement. Citing Lisa Marie Nowak's lack of a criminal history, Orange County Circuit Judge Marc Lubet sentenced her to a year of probation. She was given credit for the two days she served in the county jail after her arrest. Nowak, 46, must also perform 50 hours of community service and have no contact with the victim in the case, former Air Force Capt. Colleen Shipman. She must also send Shipman a letter of apology within 10 days, ""a sincere letter of apology, not one of these vanilla things that I see from other defendants,"" Lubet told Nowak. ""It's been almost three years since the events took place that caused this nightmare for Ms. Shipman, and you are 100 percent responsible."" In addition, Nowak must complete an eight-hour anger management course within her first 30 days of probation, Lubet said. Nowak told the judge she had undergone counseling for 1½ years and the counseling is complete, so the judge said he would not order more. Lubet said he was treating Nowak as any defendant would be treated, saying he doubts any judge would send a defendant to prison on a first offense. Shipman delivered an emotional victim statement before Nowak's sentencing, telling the court she remains convinced Nowak planned to kill her. ""Shortly after I turned 30 years old, Lisa Nowak hunted me down and attacked me in a dark parking lot,"" she said, adding that she is ""still reeling from her vicious attack"" and attempting to piece her life back together. ""The world as I knew it before Lisa Nowak is gone,"" Shipman said. ""Every stranger I see is a potential attacker. Going out in public is exhausting."" She said she has undergone nearly three years of counseling, but suffers from nightmares, anxiety and health problems such as high blood pressure and chest pains because of the incident. Nowak initially was charged with attempted kidnapping with intent to inflict bodily harm, battery and burglary of a vehicle using a weapon. If convicted, she could have faced a sentence of up to life in prison. Prosecutors accused Nowak of driving nearly 900 miles from Houston, Texas, to Orlando -- wearing NASA diapers to cut down on the number of stops she needed to make -- and donning a disguise before following Shipman from the airport's baggage claim to the parking lot in February 2007. Nowak's attorney, Don Lykkebak, has denied that she wore the diapers. Nowak has said she went to the airport to talk to Shipman, who had begun dating Nowak's former love interest, Navy Cmdr. Bill Oefelein. But Shipman, in her comments Tuesday, called that claim ""at best, ridiculous,"" saying that Nowak, whom she did not know, had ample opportunity to talk to her, as she ""stealthily followed me for hours."" ""I'm a very friendly person, your honor,"" Shipman said, adding that she would have welcomed Nowak's company ""over some hot chocolate, while I was waiting for my suitcase to arrive."" She recounted the incident and her terror as she realized Nowak was following her in the dark parking lot, as she could hear the swishing of Nowak's pants as she walked. She said she sprinted to her car, and Nowak attempted to open the car door and beat on her window, then spun a tale of being a helpless traveler who was afraid of being in a dark parking lot. Shipman said she cracked her window, and Nowak sprayed her in the face with pepper spray. ""She blasted me with what felt like acid,"" Shipman said. ""... I stomped on the gas and wondered if there was a gun pointed at my head."" At a hearing in November 2007, Orlando Police Detective William Becton testified that in a search of Nowak's car, he found maps showing how to reach the airport and its layout, a buck knife and papers, including a letter Nowak appeared to have written to Oefelein's mother. He testified he found used and clean diapers in the car. Police previously had said they also found a BB gun, a steel mallet, a 4-inch knife and rubber tubing in the vehicle. Shipman said Tuesday she thought she had escaped a carjacking. ""I had no idea that a highly paid, high-ranking military officer had just attacked me."" When she found out she had been attacked by a ""sister in arms,"" she said, she was heartbroken. Shipman said the resulting media attention and scrutiny has placed additional stress on her and her family. Before sentencing, Nowak turned to Shipman and apologized. ""I am sincerely sorry for causing fear and misunderstanding and all of the intense public exposure that you have suffered,"" Nowak said. ""I hope very much that we can all move forward from this with privacy and peace."" Lubet said he accepted her apology as sincere, but in sentencing her he noted that he was certain her conviction would affect her Navy career and retirement. Still, the judge told Nowak, ""you brought this on yourself, and I don't have any sympathy for you in that respect."" Shipman has left the military and Oefelein has left the astronaut corps, and the two live in Anchorage, Alaska, where they run a company called Adventure Write as freelance writers and photographers. People.com reported in July the two were engaged. Lubet also ordered Nowak to stay away from Oefelein after Shipman alleged in her remarks she found a book with suggestive notes inside that Nowak had sent Oefelein after the incident despite a no-contact order. ""No books, no messages, no poems, nothing,"" Lubet said. ""It's not a problem,"" Nowak responded.

"(CNN) -- It seems people only pay attention anymore when the rocket blows up. Just seconds into its launch Tuesday evening, the Orbital Sciences Antares rocket, carrying supplies to the International Space Station, suffered an explosion in the aft end of its first stage, fell back onto the launch pad and blew up in a spectacular fireball. Within minutes, the major news organizations had picked up the story and began running live interviews of eyewitnesses and experts. We learned of the experiments that were being transported to the ISS, including several student/school science projects. Had all gone as planned, the news of the launch would have earned scant mention, and certainly very few in the general public would have known anything about what was on board. Twenty years ago, I launched on my first space shuttle mission. At the time, the O.J. Simpson trial was under way, and I understand that at least one major TV news station, covering the launch live, waited until we had cleared the launch pad tower, then immediately relegated our ascent into a small corner of the screen in order to go back live to the trial. In a way, we are victims of our own success. People have gotten so used to successful flights that nothing gets their attention unless there is a mishap. And, maybe that's OK. One day, spaceflight should advance to the point of being routine, not unlike air travel. We've come a long way since launching the early astronauts into space more than 50 years ago, but accidents like this serve as a reminder that spaceflight still should not be taken for granted. By their nature, rockets and rocket engines are unforgiving, containing complex components, which must work correctly to get into space. Although the Antares explosion was a significant mishap, we will get through this. The accident investigation team will determine the root cause. We will learn from it and build even more robust rockets in the future. The crew on board ISS do not face any immediate shortages, although the shortfall from this failure will have to be made up. Without a doubt, critics will arise and question why we are entrusting cargo deliveries and future crew exchanges to commercial companies. The answer is simple: It is the logical evolution of technology and commercialization, following the same path as the development of the airplane and commercial air transportation. There is plenty of government oversight of airline operations, as there is plenty of such oversight of commercial space operations through NASA and the FAA. This mishap is painful, but it is only a speed bump on the way to the commercialization of spaceflight. We will get there, and it will be soon. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Leroy Chiao.","Former space shuttle commander: We tend to focus on the launches that fail .

"Yes, Beyoncé can sing -- all by herself, thank you very much. That much she showed Thursday, when she opened her appearance before reporters in New Orleans -- where she's set to headline the Super Bowl XLVII halftime performance Sunday -- with a stirring, a cappella rendition of the national anthem. It was the same tune she sang just over a week ago at the inauguration of President Barack Obama . But on that momentous occasion, Beyoncé admitted on Thursday, she had some help. The world-renowned pop singer told reporters that ""she decided to sing along with my prerecorded track,"" a decision she made in part because she didn't have time to rehearse with the U.S. Marine Band and had had ""no proper sound check."" ""I did not feel comfortable taking a risk,"" Beyoncé said of what she called ""a very, very important, emotional show for me."" ""I wanted to make (Obama) and the country proud."" The admission about the January 21 performance wasn't a complete shock. A spokeswoman for the Marine Band initially said Beyoncé ""was not actually singing"" the national anthem. Hours later, the band backed away from the spokeswoman's remarks, releasing a statement that said the group was not in a position to know for sure. But that hardly stopped the speculation that one of America's most famous contemporary singers had lip synced at one of the nation's most important moments. Two days after the inauguration, an inaugural official who asked not to be identified said Beyoncé ""did not sing live,"" even though ""she was spot on"" in her prerecording, which was taped separately from the band and then married together. The Houston native had been mum on the topic until she discussed the matter Thursday. Calling herself a perfectionist who will typically ""practice until my feet bleed,"" she conceded worrying about potential problems during ""a live television show"" taking place outside on a chilly Washington day. Even with all the hubbub -- and her insistence that ""I always sing live,"" with that exception -- Beyoncé expressed no regrets about her rendition of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" in front of the Capitol. ""I'm very proud of my performance,"" she said. The 31-year-old said the practice of performers singing along with prerecorded tracks is common in her industry. Still, she promised she won't be doing it Sunday during the Super Bowl halftime show. ""I will absolutely be singing live,"" Beyoncé said. ""This is what I was born to do."" As to exactly what she'll do, and with whom, she didn't say much Thursday, dodging a question about whether she will be joined by her Destiny's Child bandmates or her husband, critically acclaimed rapper Jay-Z. While Alicia Keys and Jennifer Hudson (the latter singing with the choir from Sandy Hook Elementary, the Connecticut school where 20 children were killed in December) also will perform, Knowles will command the stage once the San Francisco 49ers and Baltimore Ravens break for halftime. ""I'm trying to learn to live every moment, because these moments are not promised to us,"" she said of her excitement, recalling how she took off her shoes and ran the first time she set foot on the Superdome field. ""This is such a huge opportunity."" It's also a huge challenge, including working on a stage that needs to be put together in just more than seven minutes, condensing her career into one 12-minute set, then performing in what is often any given year's most watched program on television. Beyoncé admitted being nervous, but also said that after more than four months of preparation, she's prepared. ""I've had a 16-year career, and all of the things that I've done have prepared me for this,"" she said. ""I'm ready.""","Beyoncé says, ""I'm very proud of my performance"" at President Obama's inauguration .

"A House Intelligence subcommittee will hear from CIA security officers who are expected to tell a much more detailed story about the terror attack in Benghazi, Libya, that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans last year, CNN has learned. The men, described by sources as former Navy SEALs, former Army Special Forces and former Marines, were under contract to guard CIA agents on the ground there. The security officers were among those who responded when Stevens' compound was attacked on the night of September 11, 2012. They will appear before lawmakers behind closed doors during the week of November 11, sources told CNN. Members of Congress have been trying to get access to the security officers and CIA agents, but those attempts have failed to date. Of the estimated nearly two dozen CIA operatives on the ground that night, only one has testified, the sources said. Frustrated lawmakers have told CNN they have been dissatisfied with the investigation so far conducted by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Michigan. His staff defends the work of the committee, telling CNN previously the  review has included nine full committee hearings, roundtable discussions with some Obama administration officials, an interim report and a vow that the investigation continues. The members of Congress say they don't want information that's filtered like what they've gotten in briefings and documents, but that they want to hear the answers to three basic questions straight from those who were there: . One: What was the CIA doing in Libya? There have been allegations the CIA was operating a gun-running program with weapons going from Libya to Syrian rebels. Two: What happened during the failed rescue attempts? CNN has been told that there was a group of would-be rescuers at the CIA annex, armed and ready to go within minutes of the attack, but they were held off until finally they defied orders and staged a rescue on their own. Sen. Lindsey Graham pushes for answers . Three: Did the administration know immediately that this was a planned terrorist attack? And if so, why did administration officials try to first claim it was a spontaneous response to a demonstration over a movie that offended Muslims? ""I think that there's a real mystery here surrounding what really took place and for reasons unbeknownst to me, the Congress as well as the agency are going out of their way to protect whatever there was that they were doing operationally in Libya,"" said Fred Burton, a former State Department diplomatic security agent who has written a book about Benghazi that's now being turned into an HBO movie. And sources say the CIA has been trying to keep its employees quiet. CNN reported previously that some operatives involved in the agency's missions in Libya have been subjected to frequent -- even monthly -- polygraph examinations to find out whether they've have spoken to Congress or the media, according to sources with deep inside knowledge of the agency's workings. The CIA said in a statement this is ""patently false."" ""Not a single CIA officer who was on the ground in Benghazi during the attacks has been subjected to any CIA polygraph intended to discourage them from speaking to Congress or as retaliation,"" the agency told CNN. ""To date, some of these officers have already spoken to the oversight committees on Benghazi,"" it added.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN)The physical wounds are clear. Dozens of purple scars crisscross Lee Young-guk's lower legs. He says many are the result of beatings endured while imprisoned in North Korea's most notorious prison camp. Removing his dentures, Lee shows just five or six original teeth, wonky and cracked; the only ones has has left after countless punches to the head. Being hit with the butt of a rifle, he says, left him blind in one eye. Lee was the bodyguard to Kim Jong Il for more than 10 years, before the late North Korean leader assumed power in 1994. A once loyal servant of the regime, Lee says he left Kim's employment without issues. He realized he was not a nice man, but only after he traveled out of North Korea, and saw how other parts of the world functioned, did it become clear to him that Kim was a dictator. Walking skeletons . Lee tried to escape but was captured while trying to defect to South Korea and thrown into the infamously brutal Yodok political camp. ""If you are a political prisoner, Yodok's main goal is to kill you,"" he says. He remembers when he first arrived seeing inmates who looked like walking skeletons. ""It was tough enough that they barely fed me,"" he says. ""What was worse was they kept on beating me, and they executed people once a week, which we were forced to watch. You have to be mentally strong, then the cycle repeats itself."" In the five years between being arrested in China and his release for good behavior, Lee says he lost almost half his body weight. He says inmates were so weak from the lack of food, they were rarely able to life their heads unless ordered to do so by guards. If they were unable to complete their physical work for the day, Lee says they weren't fed. ""Then you will get hungry and your stomach will get very big, and your legs and face will turn to skeleton-like figure. But they won't feed us. Then I will die."" Lee tells me of the flower garden at Yodok, a euphemistic phrase used by defectors to describe mass graves at the camps. ""Yodok's flower garden has thousands, even tens of thousands of people in it. Lines and lines of dead bodies. I had to carry them, bodies with fluids still flowing out of them and bury them where the guards told us."" OPINION: Stop romancing North Korea . U.N. resolution . This week, members of the United Nations' third committee are expected to vote on a draft resolution, submitted by Europe and Japan, to refer North Korea to the International Criminal Court (ICC) for crimes against humanity. If it passes, it will be put to a vote by the General Assembly in December. North Korea has repeatedly denied the existence of political camps or human rights abuses in the country. Earlier this year, the government slammed a damning U.N. Commission of Inquiry into human rights in the country as an attempt to undermine the government. Kim Song, adviser for political affairs at the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's mission to the United Nations, called the report's accusations of human rights abuses ""groundless,"" and said those who escaped to tell their stories were ""human scum."" North Korea concessions . Despite rejecting the report, North Korea has made a number of recent concessions, including the unexpected release of three American prisoners. But U.N. officials say they are a transparent attempt to mitigate the report's effects and avert international action. Lee is adamant North Korean leaders must be held accountable from crimes committed against its own people. He says he met the current leader Kim Jong Un a number of times while protecting his father, when the young Kim was just a boy of six or seven years old. Now Kim is in charge, Lee wants to see him punished for these camps and his crimes. ""You need to refer Kim Jong Un to ICC, that's how places like Yodok can disappear,"" he says. ""I still have a lot of resentment.""","Former bodyguard to Kim Jong Il tells of beatings, hunger in prison camp .

"In May, SpaceX became the first of the new generation of commercial aerospace companies to deliver cargo to the International Space Station. The cargo delivery was part of the first flight test of the integrated Falcon-9 launch vehicle and the Dragon capsule spacecraft with rendezvous and berthing mechanism systems. By all accounts, the major test objectives were successfully achieved. Previously, such spacecraft and operations had only been achieved by governments. What made this a historic first was that a commercial company had done it. The news was widely covered in the international media, especially in the United States. One month later, China launched its fourth crewed space mission, Shenzhou-9. This was also a history-making flight, in that China, which had in 2003 become only the third nation capable of launching astronauts into space (and is now only one of two, since the retirement of the U.S. space shuttle in 2011), demonstrated crewed rendezvous and docking to their orbital module, Tiangong-1. The crew also featured China's first female astronaut. They spent several days docked to Tiangong-1 conducting various operations, before safely returning to Earth on Thursday night. China's mission was widely covered in the international media, but the coverage in the United States was notably quieter than that of SpaceX. This is somewhat understandable, as SpaceX is an American company. But the sentiment of many in the United States is that the Chinese mission was a big ""So what?"" After all, the United States and Soviet governments had demonstrated crewed docking missions back in the 1960s, and operationally, China is still far behind. The difference in U.S. attitudes toward these two accomplishments is striking. This is especially interesting given the relative positions of the two. SpaceX is off to an impressive start, but it will be several years from now before they (and/or other commercial players) could have an operational, crewed orbital spacecraft. China, on the other hand, has a relatively mature human spaceflight program that is nearly a decade old. We downplay China's accomplishments at our own peril. That the United States and the Soviet Union demonstrated crewed rendezvous and docking operations more than 40 years ago is not the point. The point is, now the Chinese can do it, too. China's first crewed space docking was a giant step. It enables the Chinese to build and operate their own space station, establish the technology that is necessary to efficiently send astronauts to the moon and beyond, build and operate fuel depots, and construct vehicles and bases in space. Opinion: Will China overtake America in space? The commercial efforts to low Earth orbit, which SpaceX achieved, are only a piece of the U.S. space program. The other much larger piece is exploration of deeper space. This is the domain of government space agencies. In this, the United States must not scale back. I have seen China's space technology. It is impressive. What the Chinese lack is operational experience. In that, we are still far ahead. But we in the know hear footsteps. It's time not for another government space race, but for expanded space cooperation and collaboration -- an effort the United States would lead, as it does today with the International Space Station program. Bring China into the international fold. This is how we can retain the leadership position. Otherwise, we risk falling behind.","Leroy Chiao: China's first manned space docking in June was a giant step for the country .

"The U.S. military has doubled the number of aircraft standing by in Italy if needed to evacuate Americans from the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli, Libya, CNN has learned. A decision to evacuate as violence in the Libyan capital grows is ""minute by minute, hour by hour,"" a defense official told CNN on Monday. Fierce fighting swept across the city Sunday after armed men stormed the country's interim Parliament. Sporadic bursts of gunfire and blasts could still be heard on the outskirts of the capital Monday evening. The violence appeared to be some of the worst since the 2011 revolution that ousted longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi. Turmoil in Libya: Fighting sweeps across Tripoli following violence in Benghazi . In a move that could further inflame an already tense situation,  the speaker of the interim parliament, Nuri Abu Sahmain, who is backed by Islamist forces, ordered troops known as the ""Central Libya Shield Forces"" to deploy to the capital Monday, the Libyan state news agency LANA reported. The forces, mostly from the city of Misrata, east of Tripoli, are considered to be among the most powerful Islamist-affiliated militias. They have had long-running rivalries with the heavily armed Zintan militias when both groups were based in the capital. Meanwhile, the Saudi ambassador to Libya announced that his country's embassy and consulate in Tripoli closed Monday because of the violence, and the staff has left Tripoli, according to the official Saudi Press Agency. The sites will reopen when the situation stabilizes, Ambassador Mohammed Mahmoud Al-Ali said, according to the report. Turkey took similar measures, shutting down its consulate in Benghazi, Turkey's semi-official Anadolu news agency reported. U.S. aircraft arrive in Italy . Four additional U.S. V-22 Osprey aircraft ""arrived overnight"" at the naval base in Sigonella, Italy, to join four V-22s and 200 Marines that had been moved there last week, a U.S. defense source said. The V-22 Ospreys, which can take off and land vertically with at least two dozen passengers, are ready to be in the air on six hours notice, the official said.  The additional aircraft should give the military the capability to evacuate more than 200 people from the embassy. The aircraft and Marines are part of the Marine Air-Ground Task Force Crisis Response team, stationed in Moron, Spain. The force was formed after the attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi in 2012 to provide closer standby military capability in a crisis. 4 killed, dozens more injured in violence . At least four people were killed and 90 injured Sunday in Tripoli, according to the Health Ministry. Fighters armed with heavy weapons moved in on the General National Congress as Sunday's session was adjourned.  The attackers stormed the building as members were evacuated. Fighting then spread to other parts of the city. Libya's main political forces have been slowly dividing along Islamist and liberal lines. The more liberal parties, backed by the heavily armed militias from the western mountain city of Zintan, have accused the Islamists of hijacking power and controlling the government and parliament. The GNC attack involved the al-Qaaqaa brigade, a Zintan militia based in Tripoli, which said in a statement that it had ""heeded the call of the homeland to save it from the abusing politicians."" Libya's political process has stalled as a result of infighting among the Islamist and liberal forces in the GNC, and elections for a new parliament to replace it have not yet taken place. Many Libyans view the GNC as having lost legitimacy.","Turkey joins Saudi Arabia in shutting down diplomatic missions in Libya .

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN)  -- A NASA report on the last minutes of Space Shuttle Columbia cited problems with the crew's helmets, spacesuits and restraints, which resulted in ""lethal trauma"" to the seven astronauts aboard. Columbia crew members were killed when the shuttle broke apart upon re-entering Earth's atmosphere. But the report also acknowledged that ""the breakup of the crew module ... was not survivable by any currently existing capability."" The spacecraft broke up while re-entering Earth's atmosphere near the end of its mission on February 1, 2003. The NASA report found the astronauts knew for about 40 seconds that they did not have control of the shuttle before they likely were knocked unconscious as Columbia broke apart around them.  Watch more details from the report » . The report also found that while crew members were wearing their pressurized suits, one astronaut did not have on a helmet, three were not wearing gloves and none lowered the visors before the module lost cabin pressure. One astronaut also was not seated. ""In this accident, none of those actions would have ultimately made any difference,"" said former shuttle program manager Wayne Hale, now a deputy NASA administrator. The graphic, 400-page investigative report relied on video, recovered debris and medical findings, supplemented with computer modeling and analyses. It also includes many recommendations to make space travel safer for future astronauts. A shuttle-program source told CNN the families of the astronauts who died were brought in specifically to look at the report and even in some cases to help with its preparation. The report took more than five years to complete. ""The members of this team have done an outstanding job under difficult and personal circumstances,"" said Johnson Space Center director Michael L. Coats. ""Their work will ensure that the legacy of Columbia and her heroic crew continues to be the improved safety of future human spaceflights worldwide."" Columbia broke apart some 200,000 feet over Texas -- just minutes before it was to have touched down in Florida. The shuttle's wing was damaged on takeoff when a large piece of heat-reflecting foam ripped off and gouged a hole in it. During re-entry, the hole allowed atmospheric gases to burn the wing and destroy the spacecraft. The oldest orbiter in the fleet, Columbia had just completed a 16-day science mission.  Watch the view from the command deck as the shuttle enters the atmosphere » . Killed were commander Rick Husband, pilot Willie McCool, payload commander Michael Anderson and mission specialists David Brown, Kalpana Chawla, Laurel Clark and Ilan Ramon, an Israeli Air Force colonel who was Israel's first astronaut. By request of the families of the Columbia astronauts, NASA released the report between Christmas and New Year's so that the astronauts' children would be at home where they could discuss the findings with their families in private, said former shuttle commander Pam Melroy, deputy project manager for the investigation team. ""It was a way for us to work through our grief about the accident,"" said Melroy about compiling the report. ""This was one of the hardest things I've ever done."" The report stated that ""after the crew lost consciousness due to the loss of cabin pressure, the seat inertial reel mechanisms on the crews' shoulder harnesses did not lock. ""As a result, the unconscious or deceased crew was exposed to cyclical rotational motion while restrained only at the lower body. Crew helmets do not conform to the head. Consequently, lethal trauma occurred to the unconscious or deceased crew due to the lack of upper body support and restraint."" Another section of the report focused on the pressure suits used by the space shuttle crew on launch and re-entry. It said the suits were not part of the initial design of the orbiter and that depressurization ""occurred so rapidly that the crew members were incapacitated within seconds, before they could configure the suit for full protection from loss of cabin pressure."" Melroy said investigators took some comfort in data that suggests the Columbia crew died abruptly and without suffering. ""Of course, we were relieved,"" she told reporters during a NASA conference call Tuesday afternoon. ""It is a very small blessing, but we'll take them where we can find them."" The NASA team's report evaluated every aspect of the crew cabin infrastructure, including the design of the safety belts and helmets worn by the crew. The report also included recommendations to improve spacecraft design and crew safety. Those recommendations cover a broad range of subjects from crew training, procedures, restraints and individual safety equipment to spacecraft design methods and recommendations regarding future accident investigations. ""By learning these lessons and ensuring that we continue the journey begun by the crews of Apollo 1, Challenger, and Columbia, we help to give meaning to their sacrifice and the sacrifice of their families,"" the report stated. ""It is for them, and for the future generations of explorers, that we strive to be better and go farther. The report will have little if no effect on the nine remaining space shuttle flights to come. NASA is mothballing the shuttle program in 2010 as it begins a new program, Constellation, designed to send astronauts back to the moon. There is expected to be about a five-year hiatus in manned U.S. space flight as NASA transitions to the new program, which it hopes will launch in 2015.

"A Dallas apartment where the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States had stayed is finally getting a thorough cleaning, days after the diagnosis left four people quarantined there with soiled towels and sweat-stained sheets from the Ebola patient. After some delays, the first of three phases to clean the apartment began Friday afternoon. While the process will take days, at least sheets and towels that Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan used have been removed. Also out are the four people -- the partner of the Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan, her 13-year-old son and her two 20-something nephews -- who'd been stuck there for days. They had been ordered to stay inside the apartment until October 19. By that point, enough time should have passed to determine if any of them contracted Ebola or if they're in the clear. Judge Clay Jenkins, director of the county's Homeland Security and Emergency Management, said Friday that Duncan's partner slept last night on a couch pillow on the living room floor. But now she and the others have a new place to call home in the meantime: a private 4-bedroom residence in Dallas, which was arranged with the help of someone in the local faith-based community. ""They were very glad to be going and very pleased when they got there,"" Jenkins said. ""(One of them) got a big grin on his face, and he said, 'I wish somebody would get me a basketball.' So we're going to see if we can't take care of that."" The move added to a busy day for the quartet, who until then had gotten little more than brief stops from a health official and were told not to go more than a few steps outside. On Friday, they were visited by a hazardous materials team wearing masks, boots and yellow protective gear, as seen in photos tweeted by Dallas city spokeswoman Sana Syed. A large tarp was laid out, and several oil-drum like containers were on site. Some have criticized the fact that it took so long to start the process, given that health officials announced three days ago that Duncan had Ebola. At that time, four people Duncan had stayed with in the Texas city were ordered not to leave the apartment because of possible lingering effects of Duncan, from his clothes to toilets to silverware. Additionally, the Dallas hospital where Duncan is being treated has come under fire for how it handled his first visit there eight days ago. Duncan's partner, identified only as Louise, told CNN's Anderson Cooper that hospital medical staff were twice told that Duncan, who was suffering with fever and abdominal pain, had recently arrived from West Africa -- key information that could have been a tipoff for Ebola, yet was never properly relayed. Instead, he was released with an antibiotic only to come back by ambulance even sicker on Sunday. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, acknowledged to reporters Friday that ""there were missteps"" in Dallas as to how Duncan's case was initially treated. But he also insisted that ""there were a lot of things that went right and are going right."" And Fauci stressed that, while there may be a case here and there, what's happened with Ebola in West Africa -- where more than 3,400 people have died and public health infrastructures have become overwhelmed -- won't happen in the United States. ""Our health care infrastructure in the United States is well-equipped to stop Ebola in its tracks,"" Fauci said. Official: 50 being monitored . Until this week, Ebola's impact on the United States has been confined to preemptive measures at airports and elsewhere to stop its spread, the deployment of U.S. military and other resources to West Africa to help corral the outbreak there, and the treatment of a select few Americans who contacted the virus in Africa and were flown back home to get well. But Duncan changed all that. He landed in Dallas on September 20, started feeling sick days later, then made his initial visit to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital late on September 25. He went back three days later and was quickly isolated, with a blood test confirmed he had Ebola on Tuesday. If he gets healthy, Duncan could be in trouble: Some in Liberia have accused him of lying on a pre-flight questionnaire about his contact with Ebola sufferers, leading to threats of charges by authorities there and prompting the Dallas County district attorney's office to announce it is ""looking into whether or not (he) knowingly and intentionally exposed the public to a deadly virus -- making this a criminal matter."" For now, though, any future legal battles are overshadowed by Duncan's fight for his life -- in isolation, in serious condition, at Texas Health Presbyterian. No one he'd come in contact with has shown symptoms of Ebola, though officials were watching them -- 50 people in all -- just in case. These 50 are people Duncan came in contact with while he was contagious. Monitoring means a public health worker visits the contacts twice a day to take temperatures and to ask if they are experiencing any symptoms. Dr. Beth Bell of the CDC said officials are casting a wide net. ""We have a low level of concern about the vast majority of these people that we're following,"" she said. That sentiment was echoed Friday night by Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings, who pointed out ""there is only one person"" -- Duncan, who is in isolated in a hospital -- ""that is actively showing"" signs of Ebola. Only those showing symptoms of Ebola are contagious. ""We're a little anxious, but there is no fear in our eyes,"" Rawlings said of local residents. ""We will be safe, and we will get this done in the appropriate way."" Ebola in spotlight elsewhere in U.S. Duncan isn't the only person being talked about in the United States with real or possible Ebola. Howard University Hospital in Washington has admitted a low-risk patient with symptoms ""that could be associated with Ebola,"" hospital spokeswoman Kerry-Ann Hamilton said Friday. The patient, who was not named, recently traveled to Nigeria and presented with the symptoms upon his or her return, she said. The patient is in stable condition. ""In an abundance of caution, we have activated the appropriate infection control protocols, including isolating the patient,"" Hamilton said. ""Our medical team continues to evaluate and monitor progress in close collaboration with the CDC and the Department of Health."" Officials in Georgia also said they isolated a man with flu-like symptoms who'd recently been in Africa shortly after his arrest early Friday for suspected drunken driving. But ""so far all of his labwork is negative"" and ""we have no reason to believe that he has Ebola,"" Georgia Department of Public Health commissioner Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald said. But there is one American confirmed with the virus: Ashoka Mukpo, a freelance cameraman for NBC News who was diagnosed in Monrovia on Thursday . Dr. Mitchell Levy said his son, Mukpo, remembers getting some fluid in his face while helping to disinfect a chair inside a clinic where he was filming. Mukpo, 33, a freelance cameraman for NBC News, started feeling achy and tired Wednesday, and he quarantined himself. A day later, a test at a Doctors Without Borders facility in Monrovia confirmed that he had Ebola. NBC News has said the entire team will return to the U.S. soon aboard a private charter plane. Levy said that his son will be heading to Nebraska Medical Center, which is the same facility where Dr. Rick Sacra was recently treated. Official: U.S. focusing on 'source countries' As intense as the media attention is in the United States, the issues here are nothing compared to West Africa, where Ebola continues to spread through the living and the dead and where health facilities have often been unable to keep up with the outbreak. The U.S. government has been involved in trying to help countries like Liberia, with more help possibly on its way. Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said Friday that the U.S. military could send as many as 4,000 troops to the Ebola-afflicted countries. About 200 U.S. troops are there now, and Washington had previously committed to sending 3,000 troops. The U.S. troops will not treat patients, but will help establish health facilities and medical treatment units ""so that the health care workers can do their jobs,"" Kirby said. Paying attention to West Africa, whether it's getting Ebola patients well there or doing things to prevent infected people from leaving the country, is a national security priority for the United States, said Lisa Monaco, President Barack Obama's homeland security and counterterrorism adviser. Monaco said Friday: ""We are taking steps to address the source, the people coming from the source counties and we think those are the most effective steps we can take.""","DA's office: A ""criminal matter"" if Duncan ""knowingly ... exposed"" public to Ebola .

"(CNN) -- Buzz Aldrin is used to traveling on high-profile missions. His 240,000-mile trip to the moon on July 20, 1969, set the precedent. On Thursday, Aldrin is hitching a ride aboard Air Force One to Cape Canaveral's Kennedy Space Center in Florida at the invitation of President Obama, White House spokesman Nick Shapiro said. It appears to be just one of the perks for being on Obama's side of the controversy over the president's new space program, which cancels former President George W. Bush's plan to return U.S. astronauts to the moon by 2020. Aldrin supports Obama's new space policy, and over the last 48 hours, the White House has made extraordinary efforts publicizing his position. Aides flooded the White House press corps Wednesday with e-mails, forwarding Aldrin's letter to the president. In the letter, Aldrin writes, ""As an Apollo astronaut, I know full well the importance of always exploring new frontiers and tackling new challenges as we explore space. The simple truth is that we have already been to the Moon -- some 40 years ago. What this nation needs in order to maintain its position as the 21st century leader in space exploration is a near-term focus on lowering the cost of access to space and on developing key, cutting-edge technologies that will take us further and faster. ... The President's program will help us be in this endeavor for the long haul and will allow us to again push our boundaries to achieve new and challenging things beyond Earth."" Aldrin has an op-ed Thursday in USA Today reinforcing his stance. Putting Aldrin in the spotlight is critical for the White House, which finds itself, so far, on the losing end of the public relations battle. Those opposing Obama's new space policy have tremendous prestige. They include Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk the moon; Jim Lovell, the commander of the famous Apollo 13 flight; and Gene Cernan, the last human to step on the moon's surface. The three astronauts sent an open letter to Obama calling his plan ""devastating"" to the U.S. space program. They write that ""while the President's plan envisages humans traveling away from Earth and perhaps toward Mars at some time in the future, the lack of developed rockets and spacecraft will assure that ability will not be available for many years. Without the skill and experience that actual spacecraft operation provides, the USA is far too likely to be on a long downhill slide to mediocrity. America must decide if it wishes to remain a leader in space. ..."" When asked if the president received Armstrong's open letter criticizing his new approach to human space exploration, a White House official said, ""I don't think we ever got it."" But the White House is getting the message that a lot of people are worried about Obama's new direction in space exploration, so Obama is making the trip to Kennedy Space Center, with supporter Aldrin as his wingman.","Apollo astronaut getting a lift to Kennedy Space Center as president hopes for PR lift .

"Devyani Khobragade, the Indian diplomat at the heart of a dispute that has strained ties between New Delhi and Washington, is on her way back to India from the United States, officials said. American authorities' arrest and strip-search of Khobragade, the former Indian deputy consul general in New York, set off a storm of anger in India last month. U.S. prosecutors accuse her of lying in a visa application about how much she paid her housekeeper. She was indicted this week by a federal grand jury on one count of visa fraud and one count of making false statements. But the Indian government denied a request by the State Department to waive Khobragade's diplomatic immunity so she can answer the charges, U.S. and Indian officials said. India said Friday that it had transferred her to the Ministry of External Affairs in New Delhi. ""At the time of her departure for India, Counsellor Khobragade reiterated her innocence on charges filed against her,"" the ministry said in a statement. It was unclear when exactly she would arrive in India. Khobragade ""affirmed her determination to ensure that the episode would not leave a lasting impact on her family, in particular, her children, who are still in the United States,"" the ministry said. Tensions have escalated between India and the United States over the December arrest and treatment of Khobragade, with New Delhi demanding Washington apologize and drop charges accusing her of lying on a visa application for her former housekeeper. Allegations denied . Federal prosecutors allege Khobragade promised in the visa application under which her housekeeper moved from India to the United States to pay her at least $9.75 per hour, the minimum wage in New York, and to require she work no more than 40 hours per week. They allege that Khobragade then had the housekeeper, Sangeeta Richard, sign a second contract, which paid her less than $3.31 per hour and required that she work much longer hours. Khobragade's lawyers have repeatedly said she is not guilty and is entitled to diplomatic immunity. ""She is pleased to be returning to her country,"" her attorney Dan Arshack said Thursday. ""Her head is held high."" Khobragade ""did not make any false statements and she paid her domestic worker what she was entitled to be paid,"" he said. Diplomatic status . Arshack said Khobragade and her legal team were pleased that the State Department had done ""the right thing"" Thursday by recognizing her diplomatic status. U.S. officials had previously said Khobragade was entitled to consular immunity, which is less broad than diplomatic immunity and covers only actions carried out under official duties. Khobragade was India's deputy consul general for political, economic, commercial and women's affairs. But after her arrest, Indian officials appointed her as counsellor at the country's permanent mission to the United Nations in New York. Through that post, she was accorded ""the privileges and immunities of a diplomatic envoy,"" the Indian Ministry of External Affairs said. Two senior U.S. officials said that the State Department had no choice but to grant Khobragande full diplomatic immunity once she was accredited to the United Nations because she did not pose a national security threat, which is the only reason for which, in very rare cases, immunity is denied. When India refused the U.S. request to waive the immunity so that she could face the charges against her, she had to leave the country, the officials said. Pressure from New Delhi . India has expressed outrage over the arrest of Khobragade, who was handcuffed and strip-searched by federal agents on December 12 after a complaint filed by Richard. Secretary of State John Kerry expressed ""regret"" about the situation last month, but stopped short of saying authorities had done anything wrong. U.S. law enforcement officials have said that Khobragade's strip-search was standard procedure and that she received a number of privileges not usually accorded to defendants. Amid the uproar, Indian authorities removed concrete barriers from outside the U.S. Embassy and took away American diplomats' identification cards. That was followed recently by an order that the United States shut down ""commercial activities"" at a recreational facility at the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi. The U.S. Embassy should halt the activities at the property by January 16, an Indian external affairs official said Thursday. The property houses a bowling alley, swimming pool and gym. The multipurpose club in the embassy compound was used by nondiplomats, Indian officials said, accusing the U.S. of  contravening an article of the Vienna Convention. Father's anger . Khobragade's father supported India's order that the U.S. Embassy shut down what it said were commercial activities on the mission's premises. ""The charges against her are atrocious, and the treatment meted out to her inhuman,"" Uttam Khobragade said Thursday. As the diplomatic fallout deepened, U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz delayed a trip to India that had been planned for next week. ""We have been in conversation with Indian counterparts about the dates, and we have agreed to hold the dialogue in the near future at a mutually convenient date,"" an Energy Department official said. Human rights activists say India's anger about the strip search misses the bigger issue. They say the mistreatment of domestic workers is a widespread and often overlooked problem worldwide. Officials from both nations have repeatedly said that they hope the issue does not undermine their relations.","Devyani Khobragade reiterated her innocence as she left the U.S., India says .

"The rebel seizure of the capital of the volatile Central African Republic has sent the president packing and prompted the nation's suspension from the continent's top political entity. President Francois Bozize  fled and ended up in Cameroon after rebels took Bangui on Sunday, Cameroon state TV said Monday, reporting a government communique. The ousted president sought refuge in Cameroon, where he is hoping to move to another country, the report says. The African Union -- which represents nations across the continent -- took the action against the Central African Republic after the insurgents captured Bangui. In a communique published on the AU's website, the union said the rebels violated a January cease-fire agreement and peace deal that had called for rebels to form a unity government under the nation's president. Seleka rebels call Bozize the former president . A written statement from an official with the Seleka rebels referred to Bozize as the country's former president and urged residents of the landlocked country to remain calm and prepare themselves to welcome rebel forces. A wave of unrest started in December, when the Seleka rebel coalition launched its offensive. The rebels accused Bozize of reneging on a peace deal and demanded that he step down. The rebel group, based in the country's north, managed to take control of several towns and move toward Bangui in the following weeks. The Seleka and the government brokered a new peace deal in January, agreeing to form a unity government led by Bozize. But that peace deal also fell apart. Swift world condemnation . France condemns rebels' ""use of force"" to capture Bangui and said any political transition in the former French colony should be governed by the January peace deal, according to Philippe Lalliot, spokesman for France's Foreign Ministry. British Foreign Secretary William Hague, speaking in neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo, expressed concern over reports of casualties and looting. He called for restraint and a ""swift return to democratic rule."" Catherine Ashton, the European Union's foreign policy chief, urged ""all parties to cease hostilities immediately"" and called on ""armed groups to respect and protect the civilian population."" She urged rival parties to engage in negotiations. ""Violent or unconstitutional changes of government remain unacceptable,"" she said.","Bozize is hoping to jump to another country from Cameroon .

"Perhaps it's the recent launch of Google+ Pages for brands. Perhaps it's because Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg called Google+ a ""little version of Facebook."" Or perhaps people just enjoy battles between tech titans. Whatever the reason, I've been asked at least three times in the past week about whether Google+, Google's social networking service, will ever beat Facebook. Wrong question. Facebook is the undisputed champion of social networking, with more than 800 million active users.  It's deeply interwoven with the Web -- its social plug-ins are now part of millions of websites, and an entire ecosystem of applications relies on Facebook for social functions. If Google's aim with Google+ was to topple Facebook, that's an audacious goal. Based on the current growth rates of both companies, it wouldn't seem to be a bet you could win. Toppling Facebook becomes more challenging as that site continues to keep pace -- adding new features along with users. Friend circles, a distinctive feature of Google+ at launch, were added to Facebook in the following months, removing a major incentive to switch. What's more, Facebook's launch of the ""Subscribe"" feature -- which lets you follow public updates from a user -- further erodes the advantages of using a service like Google+ or Twitter. Google didn't promote Google+ as a ""Facebook killer,"" however. Far from it. The search giant instead explained that it was building a ""social layer"" to bind its services together. That promise is now being delivered upon: A Google+ activity bar now runs across the top of Google Docs, Google Search, Gmail and virtually every other Google service. The real value of Google+ is a very small feature indeed: The +1 button.  This little widget -- Google's answer to the Facebook Like button -- is an acknowledgment that links are no longer the only way to rank websites. Instead, people are increasingly discovering content through their friends on social networks. For Google, a company that ranks Web content based on the links between pages, that's a very scary change that undermines the organization's core search-engine service. So what did Google do?  It launched a social service and put these buttons on almost all of its pages to start collecting some of those social signals. Now those little +1 votes being cast around the Web are starting to change the order of Google's search results, helping to keep Google in line with the social trend. If Google's aim was to create its own source of social voting data and avoid a nightmarish outcome -- being forced to rank your search results based solely on your Facebook connections -- then, by its own standards, Google+ is not a failure. Can Google win the social war outright? My guess is no. Nonetheless, Google could still make a big move to increase the odds: It could acquire Twitter, gaining ownership of one of the biggest databases of social signals on the Internet. Meanwhile, ""social"" is not the only battle raging in technology circles. There's also the fight for the mobile Web: Mobile operating systems and app stores are perhaps a bigger opportunity than the social trend. And while Google is the market leader in mobile operating systems, Facebook merely has a few apps (albeit the most popular ones). So Facebook, the big blue social network, may be winning a battle with Google+ but is losing the mobile war with Google at large. Can Google+ beat Facebook? I think the better question might be ""Is Google better off with Google+?"" The answer, I think, is a clear yes.","Facebook is the champion of social networking, with more than 800 million active users .
Facebook's launch of the ""Subscribe"" button puts Google+ and Twitter at a disadvantage .

"Several boats carrying as many as 150 people are believed to have capsized near the western coast of Myanmar as local residents scrambled to avoid a storm that's approaching the area, a U.N. agency said Tuesday. The boats ferrying Rohingya, a long-suffering Muslim minority, are reported to have run into trouble on Monday night as they traveled from Pauktaw township in Myanmar's Rakhine state, said Kirsten Mildren, a spokeswoman for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Bangkok. One of the boats was towing the others, and between them they were believed to be carrying 100 to 150 people, she said, noting that the exact number of boats and people involved is uncertain as conflicting reports from Rakhine continue to emerge. Some people are reported to have survived and made it to dry land, according to Mildren. Hindered by heavy rain and choppy waters, rescuers have found some bodies floating near the scene of the disaster, she said. The boats were part of an effort to relocate people in Rakhine away from low-lying areas, according to the OCHA, ahead the potential arrival of Cyclone Mahasen, a storm that may hit parts of Myanmar and Bangladesh later this week. Despite reforms, Myanmar's ethnic violence continues . A community at risk . The advocacy group Human Rights Watch has expressed concerns about the safety of tens of thousands Rohingya and other Muslims who were driven from their homes and into camps during sectarian attacks by Buddhists in Rakhine last year. Human Rights Watch estimated that half of the roughly 140,000 displaced Muslims are now ""living in flood-prone paddy fields and coastal areas that may be hit by storm surges associated with Cyclone Mahasen."" ""If the government fails to evacuate those at risk, any disaster that results will not be natural, but man-made,"" Brad Adams, the group's Asia director, said in a statement Tuesday. The OCHA said Myanmar authorities had begun late Monday to carry out a plan to move 138,000 displaced people to higher ground ahead of the storm. The boats that capsized were part of that operation, Mildren said. They were traveling from Pauktaw, where thousands of Rohingya live in camps, to other Muslim communities in the area that were to provide shelter to the passengers, she said. Pauktaw sits on a network of waterways near the coast of Rakhine, on the Bay of Bengal. ""Most of the Rohingya there in the camps are in bad conditions to begin with,"" Mildren said. ""Their shelters are not in any way cyclone-proof and these low lying areas where they are sheltering will flood."" Cyclone Mahasen is currently expected to make landfall Thursday near Chittagong, in southeastern Bangladesh. The Bangladesh border with Rakhine is a little over 100 kilometers south of Chittagong. Recent violence . Relocating the displaced Rohingya to safer areas in Rakhine comes with particular difficulties related to their troubled history. ""Some of the IDPs are reportedly afraid of the security personnel in charge of the relocations in some of the sites,"" the OCHA said in a report on the situation Monday, using the abbreviated term for internally displaced people. The Rohingya are a stateless Muslim minority -- thought to number between 800,000 and one million -- who suffered during decades of military rule in Myanmar. Though many Rohingya have only known life in Myanmar, they are viewed by Rakhine's estimated three million Buddhists as intruders from neighboring Bangladesh. Myanmar does not consider them citizens or one of the 135 recognized ethnic groups living in the country. In a report last month, Human Rights Watch accused Myanmar security forces of involvement in a Buddhist campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya in Rakhine last year. The group alleged that crimes against humanity were committed by in the attacks on the Rohingya in which scores of people were killed. The report said that while local Arakanese Buddhists were also killed and displaced in the unrest, the Rohingya suffered by far the worst of the violence. The Myanmar government dismissed the report as ""one-sided."" With the storm approaching this week, Human Rights Watch is again drawing attention to the precarious situation of the Rohingya and other Muslims in Rakhine. ""Vulnerable Muslim populations are at risk not only from the cyclone, but from violence at the hands of ethnic Arakanese communities and the very local security forces who were responsible for their displacement in the first place,"" Adams said.","Some survivors have reportedly been found, the U.N. OCHA says .

"(CNN) -- Al Qaeda says its No. 3 man and commander of its operations in Afghanistan has died, according to a group that monitors Islamist websites. Al Qaeda announced the death of Mustafa Abu Yazid in a message posted on such websites Monday, the Maryland-based SITE Intelligence Group said. While the message didn't detail the circumstances of Yazid's death, it did say his wife, three of his daughters, a granddaughter and others were killed, according to SITE. Yazid, an Egyptian national, had a ""more expansive portfolio"" than previous No. 3 officials in the terror group, according to a U.S. official who asked that he not be named since he is not authorized to speak on the record. As al Qaeda's CEO, he was important to al Qaeda's finances and has been recently involved in the facilitation of terror plots, the U.S. official said.  He was a founding member of the group and served on its leadership council, the official said. ""His leaving the scene is nothing short of significant,"" the official said. His death is a near-term blow to al Qaeda as he was the chief conduit to leaders Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, the official said. Because of its degraded capabilities, al Qaeda has found itself in the position of needing to integrate its efforts with other extremist groups such as the Pakistani Taliban and the Afghan Taliban, the U.S. official said.  Yazid helped forge relationships with those other extremist groups in Pakistan, Afghanistan and elsewhere, the official said. Yazid is believed to have been a co-founder of the terrorist group, according to SITE. A U.S. official speaking on condition of anonymity said the government has ""strong reason to believe"" that Yazid was killed recently in Pakistan's tribal areas. ""In terms of counterterrorism, this would be a big victory,"" the official said, noting that Yazid was al Qaeda's prime conduit to leader Osama bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri. Yazid served prison time with al-Zawahiri for their involvement in the 1981 assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, the U.S. official said. U.S. intelligence officials said Yazid would brief would-be al Qaeda operatives who came from the United States for attacks abroad. In the past, Yazid has made numerous statements on jihadist websites and in video releases from al Qaeda's media arm, al Sahab. Most recently, he announced that al Qaeda took responsibility for a December 30 attack on a base in eastern Afghanistan that killed seven CIA officers and consultants and a Jordanian army captain. He said the attack avenged the death of Baitullah Mehsud, leader of the Taliban in Pakistan who was killed in a missile strike in August, and al Qaeda operatives Saleh al-Somali and Abdullah al-Libi. IntelCenter, a think tank that tracks terrorist groups, said Yazid's death was one of the most significant blows against al Qaeda in recent years. But IntelCenter added that al Qaeda knows losses are inevitable and plans for them. ""While the loss of al-Yazid will have an impact, the group will likely maintain its operational tempo in terms of attacks and other activities,"" IntelCenter said in a statement. Yazid rose to the No. 3 position when Abu Laith al-Libbi was killed in 2008, the U.S. official said. Previous al Qaeda No. 3 officials to die on the job in the last decade include: Mohamed Atef (killed in 2001), Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (captured in 2003), Abu Farraj al-Libbi (captured in 2005) and Hamza Rabia (killed in 2005), the U.S. official said. CNN's Nic Robertson in Kabul, Afghanistan, and Pam Benson contributed to this report.","Al Qaeda message announces death of Mustafa Abu Yazid .

"(CNN) -- Two Texas lawmakers, upset that Houston was not picked as one of the retirement homes for NASA's space shuttles, introduced legislation Friday that would bring the Discovery shuttle to the city for 15 years. NASA announced Tuesday the locations to receive the four remaining space shuttles -- three historic orbiters and the program's test vehicle. The space shuttle Atlantis will be displayed at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in Florida; the Endeavour, at the California Science Center in Los Angeles; the Discovery, at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Virginia; and the test shuttle Enterprise at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York. ""The Smithsonian is America's museum. Over the years of their history, they have readily loaned major U.S. artifacts to the American people. What better community to host an orbiter than Houston, Texas,"" Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, said in a statement. ""America is a great country. It is a fair country, and this is a solution that is both great and fair."" Houston is home to the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center, which is where NASA's Mission Control Center is located. ""The goal of this bill is to reverse an unjust decision which would have an adverse economic impact on the city of Houston. The Johnson Space Center and its committed workforce have been a key component of the space shuttle program since it started in the 1980s,"" said Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, who introduced the legislation along with Jackson Lee. Earlier this week, 17 members of the U.S. House of Representatives Texas delegation sent a letter to NASA Administrator Charles Bolden to express their disappointment and to say they were prepared to use their power in Congress to ""stop this wasteful decision."" The decision the lawmakers seem most concerned about is the one to send the test shuttle Enterprise to New York. The Enterprise now is on display at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum. The Enterprise, which never flew in space, will be moved to New York so the Smithsonian can make room for Discovery. ""It defies logic for a shuttle to go to New York City, a place with no connection to NASA. It's like putting the Statue of Liberty in Omaha,"" Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas, said in a statement. Housing a space shuttle is not just an honor -- it means money, according to the executive director of New York's Intrepid Museum. Susan Marenoff estimates that once the shuttle is in place, her museum will see an additional 300,000 people and $106 million in economic benefit. That is a benefit Texans believe is rightfully theirs. Rep. Pete Olson, also a Texas Republican, bluntly reiterated that in a statement, saying, ""No city in the world deserves a shuttle more than Houston, certainly not New York.""","Houston is home to the Johnson Space Center and NASA's Mission Control Center .
The city was not selected to receive a retired space shuttle .
The legislation would bring the Discovery shuttle to Houston for 15 years .

"Abbottabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- U.S. officials issued a revised version of the nighttime raid that killed the world's most-notorious terrorist, including additional details that revealed other options were on the table before settling on the assault. The 40-minute raid early Monday in Pakistan left Osama bin Laden dead, along with four others in the complex that sits on a mountainous region near the capital. Bin Laden was not armed during the raid, but he put up resistance when U.S. forces entered the compound, the White House said. Officials had earlier said that bin Laden was an active participant in the firefight, implying that he was armed and gave the U.S. Navy SEALs little choice but to shoot him down. After the operation, U.S. forces departed with the al Qaeda leader's body, nearly 10 years after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States. ""It was a staggering undertaking and there was no one else, I believe, other than an American group of military warriors who could do it,"" U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said Tuesday. ""And the world is a safer place today, not only for the American people but for all people."" Officials on Tuesday offered new details about the raid and clarified earlier accounts. U.S. military personnel arrived on two helicopters, attacked the residence and started moving methodically from room to room, said White House Press Secretary Jay Carney. They were engaged in a firefight throughout the operation, he said. There were no armed guards around the compound, according to a U.S. official who is not authorized to speak on the record. Original plan . CIA Director Leon Panetta told PBS ""NewsHour"" that the original plan was for two Black Hawk helicopters, carrying 25 people, to go into the compound. The first was to go over a courtyard, while the second was to go over the roof. But the first helicopter had problems and had to set down on the ground, prompting the second one to do the same, he said. ""Both teams immediately went into the compound itself. They had to breach about three or four walls in order to get in there,"" he said. ""They were able to do that and they immediately then went into the compound itself and fought their way up to the third floor."" Officials called the U.S. operation a surgical raid -- and said it was conducted by a small team and designed to minimize collateral damage. The compound is in Abbottabad, about 50 kilometers (31 miles) north of the Pakistani capital of Islamabad. The city sits in a region where most residents are army personnel. When it was first built, the compound was secluded and reachable by only a dirt road, officials have said. In recent years, more residences were built around it, but it remained by far the largest and most heavily secured property in the area. The compound had outer walls up to 18 feet tall topped with barbed wire, with two security gates and a series of internal walls that sectioned off different portions of the compound, senior administration officials have said. Bin Laden ""didn't hold his hands up"" Months of intelligence work determined that the compound was custom-built to hide a high-value terrorism suspect, almost certainly bin Laden. There was no telephone or Internet service at the dwelling, which was valued at more than $1 million. Its occupants burned their trash rather than leave it out for collection as other area residents did. Besides the bin Laden family, two other families lived in the compound, according to Carney. On the first floor of the building, two al Qaeda couriers were killed in addition to a woman caught in the crossfire, he said. Bin Laden and his family lived on the second and third floors, and they were cleared last, with bin Laden killed toward the end of the siege, Carney said. Bin Laden was not armed but did put up resistance when U.S. forces entered the compound, he said. According to the U.S. official, who is not authorized to speak on the record, bin Laden ""didn't hold his hands up and surrender."" A woman in the room with him -- believed to be bin Laden's wife -- rushed U.S. forces and was shot in the leg, but not killed, said Carney. Officials had earlier said that bin Laden was shielded during the shooting by women, including his wife. Five of the approximately two dozen people in the compound were killed -- the two couriers, the woman, bin Laden and his son, said the U.S. official who sought anonymity. Panetta told PBS he didn't think bin Laden said anything to U.S. forces before he was killed. ""To be frank, I don't think he had a lot of time to say anything. It was a firefight going up that compound and by the time they got to the third floor and found bin Laden, I think this was all split second action on the part of the SEALs,"" he said. Team practiced on a replica of the compound . Prior to the assault, U.S. intelligence officials provided detailed satellite images of the compound, which was enough to construct a replica, according to a senior defense official. Team members practiced on that mock-up, and knew the height of every wall, and which gates to go through, the official said. Obama and senior administration officials have said that no U.S. forces were harmed during the operation. According to the senior administration officials, intelligence work determined at the beginning of 2011 that bin Laden might be at the compound in Pakistan. By mid-February, the intelligence was strong enough to begin considering action. To discuss that intelligence and develop a plan, Obama chaired five National Security Council meetings from between March and April, with the last two on April 19 and April 28 -- last Thursday. The next day, on Friday, Obama gave the order for the mission, the officials said. Multiple options . A U.S. official said multiple options were considered before settling on the assault. ""A bombing would not have risked American lives but it might have left questions"" as to whether bin Laden was killed, the official said. National security officials agreed ""the best option is the one that gives proof,"" the official said. The key break involved one of bin Laden's trusted couriers, according to various officials. About two years ago, intelligence work identified where the courier and his brother lived and operated in Pakistan. It took until August of last year to find the compound in Abbottabad, they said. ""When we saw the compound where the brothers lived, we were shocked by what we saw -- an extraordinarily unique compound,"" one senior administration official said. ""The compound sits on a large plot of land in an area that was relatively secluded when it was built. It is roughly eight times larger than the other homes in the area."" Noting that the courier and his brother had no discernible source of wealth to live at such a property, intelligence analysts concluded the compound was ""custom-built to hide someone of extraordinary significance,"" the official said, adding: ""Everything was consistent with what experts thought Osama bin Laden's compound would look like.""

"(CNN) -- In the dark of night, U.S. helicopters approached a high-walled compound in Pakistan on a mission to capture or kill one of the world's most notorious terrorist leaders. Less than 40 minutes later -- early Monday morning in Pakistan -- Osama bin Laden was dead, along with four others inside the complex, and the U.S. forces departed with the slain al Qaeda leader's body to fulfill a vow that originated shortly after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States. And as he announced the raid at the White House Sunday night, U.S. President Barack Obama called bin Laden's death ""the most significant achievement to date in our nation's effort to defeat al Qaeda."" One senior administration official called the investigation a ""team effort"" and a ""model of really seamless cooperation"" across agencies. This official and others briefed reporters on further details about the assault on the compound, which they believe was built five years ago for the specific purpose of hiding bin Laden -- known by the code name ""Geronimo,"" a U.S. official said. A senior administration official said later that ""Geronimo"" was code for the act of capturing or killing bin Laden, not the man himself. The compound is in Abbottabad, about 50 kilometers (31 miles) north of the Pakistani capital of Islamabad. The city sits in a mountainous region that is not heavily populated. Many of the residents are army personnel. While senior administration officials would not offer a breakdown of the U.S. mission's composition, a senior defense official said U.S. Navy SEALs were involved. After years of intelligence work and months of following a specific lead, they traced a courier linked to bin Laden to the compound in Abbottabad, the officials said. When first built, the compound was secluded and reachable by only a dirt road, the officials said. In recent years, more residences built up around it, but it remained by far the largest and most heavily secured property in the area, they said. The mission ordered Friday by Obama found outer walls up to 18 feet tall topped with barbed wire, with two security gates and a series of internal walls that sectioned off different portions of the compound, the senior administration officials said. The main structure was a three-story building with few windows facing the outside of the compound, and a third-floor terrace had a 7-foot privacy wall, they said. Months of intelligence work determined that the compound was custom-built to hide a high-value terrorism suspect, almost certainly bin Laden. The officials noted there was no telephone or Internet service at the dwelling, which was valued at more than $1 million, and its occupants burned their trash rather than leave it out for collection as other area residents did. Calling the U.S. operation a surgical raid, officials said it was conducted by a small team and designed to minimize collateral damage. A firefight was under way for most of the 40 minutes that U.S. Special Operations forces were in the compound, as the team encountered resistance from bin Laden and three other men, a senior defense official said. The official said the forces had to fight their way through the first floor of the three-story building, where two adult males lived. Bin Laden and his family lived on the second and third floors, and they were cleared last, with bin Laden killed in the last five or 10 minutes of the siege, the official said. One of bin Laden's wives identified his body to U.S. forces after the team made visual identification, the official said. In the end, all four of the combatants in the compound were dead, along with a woman whom one of the men used as a human shield, the officials said. Sources said bin Laden was shot in the head. John Brennan, assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, said it is his understanding that the woman who was killed was one of bin Laden's wives. Later, a senior U.S. official said that bin Laden's wife was not the woman killed and that she may not have been used as a human shield after all. This official also said that bin Laden was shot twice, once in the chest and once in the head. At some point, one of the assaulting helicopters crashed due to a mechanical failure, according to the officials. It was destroyed as the U.S. team flew away, they said. Obama and the senior administration officials said no U.S. forces were harmed in the operation, which took place very early Monday morning Pakistani time. Shandana Syed, a resident doctor in Abbottabad, said she woke up to a large thundering sound. ""My initial reaction was that maybe we're being attacked ... I saw the last helicopter. It was flying very low. Initially I was too afraid to get out. I was very terrified,"" she said. U.S. officials said they used a number of methods to identify the body as bin Laden. One official said it was clear to the assault force that the body matched bin Laden's description, but they used ""facial recognition work, amongst other things, to confirm the identity."" A senior national security official told CNN that they had multiple confirmations that the body was bin Laden, saying they had the ""ability to run images of the body and the face."" Another U.S. official told CNN that bin Laden has already been buried at sea. His body was handled in the Islamic tradition, said the official, who did not elaborate. A senior administration official also said bin Laden's body would be ""handled in accordance with Islamic practice and tradition. This is something that we take very seriously, and so therefore this is being handled in an appropriate manner."" According to the senior administration officials, intelligence work determined at the beginning of 2011 that bin Laden might be located at the compound in Pakistan. By mid-February, the intelligence was considered strong enough to begin considering action pledged by Obama when bin Laden's whereabouts had been determined. To discuss that intelligence and develop a plan, Obama chaired five National Security Council meetings from mid-March until late April, with the last two on April 19 and April 28 -- last Thursday. The next day, on Friday, Obama gave the order for the mission, the officials said. A U.S. official said multiple options were considered before settling on the assault. ""A bombing would not have risked American lives but it might have left questions"" as to whether Bin Laden was killed, the official said. National security officials widely agreed ""the best option is the one that gives proof,"" the official said. The key break involved one of the few couriers trusted by bin Laden, according to the officials. About two years ago, intelligence work identified where the courier and his brother lived and operated in Pakistan, and it took until August of last year to find the compound in Abbottabad, they said.

Noting that the courier and his brother had no discernible source of wealth to live at such a property, intelligence analysts concluded the compound was ""custom-built to hide someone of extraordinary significance,"" the official said, adding: ""Everything was consistent with what experts thought Osama bin Laden's compound would look like."" U.S. forces also recovered what a senior intelligence official is calling ""quite a bit of material."" ""There's a robust collection of materials we need to sift through, and we hope to find valuable intelligence that will lead us to other players in al Qaeda,"" the senior intelligence official said. A task force has been set up ""because of the sheer volume of material collected. That material is currently being exploited and analyzed,"" the official added.

"Two U.S. military aircraft flew into China's newly claimed and challenged air defense zone over the East China Sea, a U.S. official said, an action that could inflame tensions between the world powers. The U.S. Air Force B-52 planes -- which were not armed because they were on a training mission -- set off Monday from Guam and returned there without incident. The mission lasted for several hours, and the aircraft were in China's newly declared air zone for about an hour, according to the U.S. official. The planes' pilots did not identify themselves upon entering the disputed airspace, as China would have wanted, according to the official. The official declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation. The flights came two days after China unilaterally announced the creation of a ""Air Defense Identification Zone"" over several islands it and Japan have both claimed. The two countries have been sharply at odds over those isles, which are believed to be near large reserves of natural resources. Washington responded negatively to what Secretary of State John Kerry characterized as an ""escalatory action (that) will only increase tensions in the region and create risks of an incident."" The U.S. government has rallied around its ally Japan, where thousands of its troops are stationed as part of a security treaty. And specifically regarding China's new air defense zone, the United States has said it won't recognize it -- nor China's call that aircraft entering it identify themselves and file flight plans. Beijing, though, has dismissed the American position as unjustified and urged Washington to butt out of the territorial dispute. Chinese defense ministry spokesman Col. Yang Yujun on Sunday called such criticism ""completely unreasonable,"" ""irresponsible"" and ""inappropriate,"" telling the United States to stop taking sides and not send more ""wrong signals"" that could lead to a ""risky move by Japan."" And China's foreign ministry lodged a formal complaint with U.S. Ambassador Gary Locke asking Washington ""to correct its mistakes immediately."" On Tuesday, China's U.N. Ambassador Liu Jieyi sidestepped a question about American warplanes violating his nation's new air defense zone. At the same time, he defended the zone's creation, calling it a ""normal arrangement"" that ""doesn't really change anything."" ""It's natural, it's indeed the right of every country to defend its airspace and also to make sure that its territorial integrity, its sovereignty are safeguarded,"" Liu said at the United Nations. Japan's two main commercial airlines said Wednesday that following a request from the Japanese government, they and other members of the Scheduled Airlines Association of Japan will not submit flight plans to Chinese authorities for flights through the zone claimed by Beijing. The two carriers, Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways, said the association had concluded that there would be ""no impact"" on the safety of passengers on board flights through the zone without the submission of flight plans to China. Long-running dispute over islands . The disagreement centers around what's known as the Senkaku Islands by Japan and the Diaoyu Islands by China, which are close to strategically important shipping lanes and surrounded by waters full of rich marine life. China says its claim to these islands extends back hundreds of years. Japan, on the other hand, says it saw no trace of Chinese control of the islands in an 1885 survey, so formally recognized them as Japanese sovereign territory in 1895. Japan then sold the islands in 1932 to descendants of the original settlers. The dispute intensified in the second half of 2012. Why China's new air zone incensed Japan, U.S. Protests erupted in China after Japan announced it had bought several of the disputed islands from private Japanese owners. The deal was struck in part to prevent the islands from being bought by the controversial Tokyo governor, Shintaro Ishihara, who had called for donations for a public fund to buy them. This sale outraged China's government, and groups of its citizens protested violently in several Chinese cities, calling for boycotts of Japanese products and urging the government to give the islands back. In December 2012, the dispute escalated further when Japan scrambled fighter jets after a Chinese plane was seen near the islands. That situation has recurred repeatedly since, and China's latest announcement makes it likely it will keep happening. At sea, Chinese ships have frequently entered contested waters despite warnings from the Japanese Coast Guard. China slams 'inappropriate' U.S. remarks on territorial dispute . How does the new air defense zone factor into these disputes? Some in Japan, for one, have viewed the Chinese move as provocative, as does the United States. ""This ... appears to be an attempt to unilaterally change the status quo in the East China Sea, and thus will raise regional tensions and increase the risk of miscalculation, confrontation and accidents,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Tuesday. A story in China's state-run Xinhua news agency plays down its significance, with naval expert Zhang Junshe insisting ""other nations do not need to be alarmed."" He noted that Japan, South Korea, the Philippines and Vietnam all have their own air defense zones. Given these nations' close proximity to each other, it's inevitable some such zones will overlap, another expert, Chai Lidan, said in the same report. Psaki said Washington is bothered by China -- or, for that matter, any country -- asking foreign planes entering what it calls its airspace to identify themselves. ""The United States does not apply that procedure to foreign aircraft,"" she added, ""so it certainly is one we don't think others should apply."" Chinese aircraft carrier group on the move . China's military, meanwhile, announced on its website early Wednesday that its navy's sole aircraft carrier was heading toward the South China Sea. That's where China has had territorial disputes with other Asian nations including the Philippines and Vietnam. At the same time, the East China Sea -- where it recently declared an ""air defense zone"" causing a stir with Japan and its ally the United States -- is not far away. The carrier, named Liaoning, set out from a shipyard in eastern China's Qingdao city on Tuesday morning, the military said on its website. China's state-run CCTV also reported the news, showing the carrier -- which was commissioned in September 2012 and first had aircraft leaving and landing on it two months later, according to the U.S. Defense Department -- heading out to sea. As with U.S. aircraft carriers, it doesn't travel alone: Two guided missile destroyers and two guided missile frigates are accompanying the massive ship as part of its group. Why? The Chinese military makes no mention of the dispute with Japan and its ally, the United States. Rather, its website post notes that the carrier group's mission is to conduct scientific experiments and military training. That said, it is noteworthy that -- in order to get from Qingdao to the South China Sea -- the aircraft carrier group has to first go through the East China Sea.","Japanese airlines say they will not submit flight plans to China for the zone .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- When man first walked on the moon 40 years ago, it was not only a ""giant leap for mankind"" but also a boon for everyday items. A NASA-inspired tracking system is helping monitor endangered whale sharks. Sports shoes, for example, took a huge leap forward in the late 1980s when AVIA Group International, then a subsidiary of Reebok, turned to space technology to make them more flexible and durable. Freeze-dried food, artificial limbs, cordless vacuum cleaners and edible toothpaste were also developed using research that can be linked to NASA's forays into space. They are listed in detail in ""Spinoff,"" a NASA magazine first compiled in 1976 as a definitive guide to the commercialized products whose development can be tied to space technology. ""We are fairly liberal with our application of the term spinoff,"" said editor Daniel Lockney. ""The product has to contain a component that was developed for NASA, some aspect of it or it could just be NASA's know-how that helped the commercialization of the product,"" he said. More than 1,660 articles on space-related products have been published since the magazine's first edition.  Watch some of the spin-offs developed from space technology » . What you won't find on the list is the bright orange powered drink, Tang, or Teflon, or Velcro -- all products that have over time been erroneously linked to NASA's space mission. ""Tang was developed by General Foods before NASA was even made a federal agency, but it was popularized during astronaut tasting experiments,"" Lockney said. ""Velcro was invented by a Swiss engineer in the 1940s,"" he said, adding ""Teflon was created by Dupont. It has many applications within NASA but is not a NASA technology."" Infant formula makes the grade due to an ingredient discovered during NASA research into algae as a source of food supplements. ""Different experiments led to the discovery of a nutrient substance that has previously only been found in breast milk. [This is] believed to be important in the development in the eyes and the brain."" It's now in 95 percent of infant formula sold in the U.S. and in 65 countries around the world, Lockney said. It may have been 40 years since NASA put the first man on the moon, but the number of products that use space technology doesn't seem to be diminishing. ""Spinoff"" publishes articles on 40 to 50 new space-related products every year but receives many more submissions for inclusion. The next edition due out in October will feature a new tracking system for endangered animals, including polar bears and whale sharks, which was derived from an algorithm developed for tracking star patterns. ""Tracing theses animals is something that previously a small core group of scientists would go out and do. We're now able to have ordinary citizens upload their pictures of these animals that have been spotted through Flickr and Facebook. Logging times and dates will significantly increase the level of monitoring of these endangered species,"" Lockney said. For more space-related products see NASA's ""Spinoff"" Web site.","Many common products can be traced back to research conducted by NASA .

"One video shows more than 100 prisoners paraded across the desert in their underwear, then lying face down as militants unleash a hailstorm of bullets into their bodies. Other images show crucifixions and public executions in towns overrun by terrorists. And recent footage showing the beheading of a second American journalist proves that ISIS wants the world to know how brutal it can be. The insurgents are experts at using footage of their crimes as propaganda to terrify those who disagree with their radicalism and to threaten foreign leaders. The visuals are as much a part of ISIS' terrorism as its bloody march across the Iraq and Syria. In the video of American Steven Sotloff's decapitation, the executioner has a stern warning for the U.S. President: . ""I'm back, Obama, and I'm back because of your arrogant foreign policy towards the Islamic State,"" the man says in the video, released just days after fellow journalist James Foley was beheaded. ""Just as your missiles continue to strike our people, our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people."" Even a 7-year-old child was photographed holding a severed head. The picture was reportedly taken in Raqqa, the ISIS stronghold in Syria, where the boy's Australian father had taken his family to join the fight. More decapitations . Publicized beheadings had actually stopped in years past . A decade ago, al Qaeda -- the terror group that spawned ISIS -- made headlines with a series of decapitations, including those of Americans Nicholas Berg and  Eugene ""Jack"" Armstrong. Top al Qaeda official Ayman al-Zawahiri criticized the gruesome antics, and the decapitations stopped. But al Qaeda has since disowned ISIS, and al-Zawahiri has not condemned Foley's execution. That means the beheadings could continue. But it's not just Western captives who fall victim. Last week, a Kurdish man was executed in front of a mosque in Mosul in a video called ""A message written in blood,"" notes Charlie Cooper, Middle East researcher at the Quilliam Foundation. But because that message ""was directed at the President of Iraqi Kurdistan, this particular piece of propaganda did not receive widespread coverage in the international media,"" Cooper wrote in a piece for CNN.com. ""They have shown their willingness to kill anyone in their path -- not just Americans, not just Westerners, but Iraqis of all faiths, of all sects,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said. ""They've shown their complete barbarism in doing that."" The media's role . Cooper said the media has a responsibility to treat ISIS propaganda carefully. ""Every time a still or clip from an ISIS video is shown, the group gets what it wants: the oxygen of publicity,"" he wrote. ""Of course, it is necessary that people the world over are aware of the atrocities occurring at the hands of ISIS, but journalists must be careful not to do the jihadists' job for them."" The decision on whether to publicize parts of the recent beheading videos have even divided journalists. International broadcaster Al Jazeera said it had decided not to show any images of Sotloff from the video -- a more conservative position than other TV networks. ""We suggest all media do the same,"" Al Jazeera's public relations account said via Twitter, using the hashtag #ISISmediaBlackout. And while the video has been blocked from various video sharing platforms, they have also reappeared as many times, Quilliam senior researcher  Erin Marie Saltman wrote. She said that kind of trend ""once again emphasizes that the new frontline for counter-terrorist practitioners is online extremism."" Glossy recruitment tools . Part of the problem is the radicals are extremely tech- and media savvy. ""We are way behind. They are far superior and advanced than we are when it comes to new media technologies, social media, when it comes to video production qualities, and in disseminating their propaganda over the Internet,"" said Maajid Nawaz, a former jihadi and author of ""Radical: My Journey out of Islamist Extremism."" Some videos used by the terrorists rival the production quality of Hollywood films. One hourlong video shows a collection of bombings, executions, kidnappings and beheadings. As one roadside bomb blasts a vehicle into the sky, two men in the background of the video chuckle. The recruitment tactics can be both blatant and subtle. For about $10, supporters can buy a shirt with ISIS' logo and phrases such as, ""We are all ISIS"" and ""Fight for Freedom, Until the Last Drop of Blood."" And it may be no accident that a militant with a British accent fronted the video of Foley's death. That kind of tactic could inspire more foreign jihadists, a former ISIS fighter told CNN. ""It is possible that the goal was to project the image that a European, or a Western person, executed an American so that they can showcase their Western members and appeal to others outside Syria and make them feel that they belong to the same cause.""

"Jason Koger is happy to be alive. In 2008, the young husband and father was riding his four-wheeler on his grandfather's farm when he came in contact with a downed power line. His body was jolted with 7,200 volts of electricity. ""I remember waking up from an induced coma a few days later and being told that they had to amputate my both hands in order to save my life,"" said Koger, now 34.  ""My mom and dad kept telling me that I would get through this."" And he has. Since his accident, Koger has had a variety of prosthetic hands to help him function with his ""new normal"" in everyday life. ""It's like I'm carrying a tool box, but only have one tool,"" said Koger. ""You can't use a wrench for everything."" In recent years, the prosthetic devices field has seen remarkable developments. And Koger is the first double amputee in the world to receive one of the most innovative products on the market: bionic hands that are, in part, controlled by an iPhone app. The i-Limb Ultra Revolution is the latest innovation from UK-based prosthetic developers Touch Bionics. FDA approves first bionic eye . The hand offers ""unparalleled dexterity and control, enabling wearers to more easily perform activities of daily living and thus increase their quality of life,"" said Ian Stevens, CEO of Touch Bionics. The company claims it offers the closest thing on the market to a real human hand. Unlike most conventional prosthetics, this hand boasts five individually-powered fingers -- including a fully rotatable thumb. ""This is something we've never seen available for patients before,"" said John Miguelez, senior clinical director at Advanced Arm Dynamics, who is not affiliated with Touch Bionics. The prosthesis also has an auto-grasp feature, which prevents accidental slippage when, say, holding a soda can or picking up an apple. But the most unique part of the prosthetic is the app control. On an iPod Touch or an iPhone 5, users can select 24 different types of grip patterns that will allow more functionality. ""If you are holding a computer mouse (and) you want to right click, that is a complicated thing with a prosthetic. But this integrated app technology allows a person to do this with ease,"" said Miguelez. These are basic movements many of us take for granted: a tri-pod grip to pick up a pen, or hand-shake grip for business meetings, said Miguelez, who has fitted hundreds of amputees with prosthetic devices. Amputee scales 103 floors with mind-controlled 'bionic leg' ""For the first time in five years I can hold my daughter's hand,"" said Koger. ""I can't tell you what a gift that feels like."" Users can also customize grip patterns through the integrated app technology. ""Let's say you want to go out and play pool with your friends. You can customize a grasp pattern that allows you to hold the pool stick -- or if you like to do handy work, you may customize one to hold an electric drill,"" said Miguelez. The hands are not waterproof, which is one reason Koger says he'll still keep his other prosthetics, like his metal claw, available. ""Nothing is perfect, but I feel like I can be a more active participant in everyday life with these hands,"" said Koger, who now spends his time reaching out to new amputees about keeping a positive outlook on their situation. ""I can do pretty much everything I could before; it just might take me a little longer.""","Jason Koger's hands were amputated after a four-wheeler accident .

"(CNN) -- One week ago, the chief of Pakistan's Army Staff, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, told graduating cadets in the city of Abbottabad that the ""back of terrorism"" in Pakistan had been broken, thanks to the sacrifices of Pakistan's soldiers. Kayani was speaking at the ""passing out parade"" at the prestigious Kakul military academy in Abbottabad, the West Point of Pakistan. At that very moment, the man who had dragged Pakistan into the ""War on Terror"" a decade earlier was, it transpires, just a mile or two away, living in apparent comfort behind the high walls of a very private compound. Osama bin Laden, who had declared war on Pakistan, had apparently been living for months in a city that had made its name as a military garrison. Abbottabad, pronounced AHB-tah-bahd, is some 60 miles by winding mountainous roads north of Pakistan's capital. Surrounded by green hills, it is renowned for its trees and parks. It's a popular retirement place for officers in the Pakistani army, partly because of its military academy, but also because of its agreeable climate. During British rule, the Imperial Gazeteer of India described it as ""picturesquely situated,"" 4,120 feet above sea level. Abbottabad sits on the Karakoram Highway, an engineering marvel that links Pakistan with China through the Himalayas. Before much of Pakistan became off-limits to most foreign tourists, it was also a popular spot for those on their way to and from the Swat valley and the foothills of the Himalayas. But despite its military traditions, its hockey fields and golf courses, Abbottabad and neighboring districts are also familiar territory to al Qaeda and other extremist groups. In January this year, Pakistani security forces stormed a modest house in the city and seized Umar Patek, an Indonesian linked to al Qaeda who had a $1 million bounty on his head under the FBI's Rewards for Justice program. He had allegedly helped build the bombs used in the 2002 bombings in Bali that killed 200 people. Patek -- a key leader in the Indonesian terrorist group Jemaah Islamiya -- had rented a room in the house of a retired accountant in Abbottabad after arriving in Pakistan some months earlier on a forged visa. He is now being held (after treatment for gunshot wounds sustained during his arrest) pending a decision on his extradition. Patek's arrest followed that of a Pakistani in Abbottabad called Tahir Shehzad, an alleged al Qaeda facilitator who had been under surveillance for some time, according to Pakistani media reports. Shehzad had allegedly gone to Lahore to meet two French militants who were planning to travel to North Waziristan with Patek. So Abbottabad emerges as something of a way station for al Qaeda and associated groups. Geographically, that makes sense. As the crow flies, the city is just over 100 miles from the border with Kunar province in Afghanistan, an area where al Qaeda has kept a foothold since 9/11. Even with poor roads and mountainous terrain in between, the journey can be completed in a day. It is even closer to the restive tribal territories. In the past two years, the Pakistani army in this area has been preoccupied with reversing the gains of the Pakistani Taliban, rather than chasing down the remnants of al Qaeda or launching the offensive against militants in North Waziristan that Washington has long demanded. The area to the north of Abbottabad saw a surge in Taliban activity two years ago, as the Taliban sought to extend their influence from the tribal areas that border Afghanistan into what was North West Frontier Province, now called Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The town of Buner, just 30 miles from Abbottabad and 60 miles from Islamabad, fell to the Taliban early in 2009. They also established a training camp close to the town of Mansehr, a few miles from Abbottabad. The Pakistani military has since gradually reasserted control over the area, expelling the Taliban from the Swat Valley, but at a bloody cost. Clashes continue sporadically in the area, and an attack on the offices of the charity World Vision last year in Mansehr resulted in six of the non-governmental organization's workers being shot dead. To the east of Abbottabad is Pakistani Kashmir, its forested hills hosting training camps for several groups committed to ""liberating"" Indian Kashmir. So it is a city close to the front lines of several of South Asia's insurgencies and terror campaigns. Like much of the region, Abbottabad has long been a theater of sectarian and religious rivalry. Back in the mid-19th century a British officer named Maj. James Abbott brought peace to an area that saw violent confrontations between its Sikh and Muslim populations. Abbott's contribution was recognized when the town was named after him. He even wrote a poem about the place that would bear his name: . ""I remember the day when I first came here . And smelt the sweet Abbottabad air ...""","Abbottabad is home to Pakistan's equivalent of West Point .
It is on a key road, and is something of a way station for terrorist groups .
Other wanted terrorist leaders have been found in the city ."
"(CNN) -- Congress has passed a $19 billion bill authorizing NASA to launch an additional shuttle mission and to develop a heavy-lift vehicle. Late Wednesday, the House passed the NASA Reauthorization Act following the Senate's approval, giving NASA the authority to move forward with President Barack Obama's strategy for the agency, including encouraging commercial development of space transportation systems. ""We want to thank Congress for NASA's future,"" Lori Garver, NASA's deputy administrator, said during a media teleconference Thursday. ""It puts NASA programs on a more sustainable future,"" said Garver. The bill overwhelming passed both houses of Congress and Obama is expected to sign it. The exact amount of money each NASA program receives will be decided by congressional appropriations, but not until after the November elections. The bill authorizes an additional shuttle launch, extending the retirement date of the shuttle program from February 2011 until June 2011.  The NASA administrator said an additional shuttle mission could help stock additional supplies on the international space station. The bill extended the space station's life five additional years, until 2020. It's expected as the shuttle program comes to an end that more than 9,000 shuttle workers will lose their jobs. The NASA deputy administrator said she didn't believe this bill would affect planned layoffs, ""certainly not for tomorrow."" More than 1,200 shuttle workers are to be laid off on Friday. Thursday was the last day for laid-off employees to report to their workstations. Shuttle workers on their last day were to receive their final paperwork. Many of the departing workers have worked on the shuttle program since its beginning. A spokeswoman for one of NASA's primary contractors at the John F. Kennedy Space Center in Florida, United Space Alliance,  said ""it's too early to tell what, if any, impact"" the congressional appropriation may have on workforce levels in the months ahead. ""The authorization bill will not have an impact on this Friday's layoff, but it will result in adjustments to our plans for the timing and magnitude of future workforce reductions,"" said Tracy Yates of United Space Alliance, the primary contractor being affected by the layoffs Friday. Yates added that the development of a heavy-lift vehicle ""should offer promising opportunities and future work for United Space Alliance."" An official of an association representing commercial space flight contractors hailed the new strategy of government encouragement for commercial companies to develop systems for transporting astronauts and cargo to the space station. ""America's space industry is taking a quantum leap forward with this historic shift,"" said John Gedmark, executive director of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation. ""This bill will allow multiple private companies to move forward with  developing this capability,"" he said, adding that tax money will be saved and ""thousands of new high-tech jobs"" will be created in those companies.","The NASA budget approved by Congress will extend the shuttle program until next June .

"About every two weeks, Rick Allen gets a series of thermal snapshots from high above Earth that show how water gets used across the western United States, a perennial source of friction in the largely arid region. ""We see all of the cold spots, which are irrigated fields,"" said Allen, the director of the Water Resources Research Program at the University of Idaho. ""We take the relative temperatures and transform that into an equivalent of an amount of water used in cubic feet per acre per day, or cubic meters, or inches of depth. We can transform that information into types of units that are used by water managers and state agencies to manage water consumption."" The stream of data that Allen dips into has been flowing since 1984, when NASA's Landsat 5 satellite went into orbit. Landsat 5 finally shut down in November, and it successor, Landsat 7, beams back a set of images of Allen's region to the U.S. Geological Survey every 16 days -- but because of a faulty scanner, they come in with black streaks across them. A replacement is being readied for launch, but it's unlikely to make it aloft before January. ""We'll be hobbling through the year 2012 using only Landsat 7 with incomplete imagery,"" Allen said. ""That's really hurting us badly."" It's a problem facing other scientists as well, as a combination of budget pressure, program delays and a pair of launch failures leaves the United States facing a ""rapid decline"" in its fleet of Earth-science satellites, the National Academy of Sciences warns. Of 23 such satellites now aloft -- carrying dozens of instruments that help weather forecasters produce storm warnings and measure pollution, ocean winds and sea levels -- only six are expected to remain in operation by 2020, and efforts to replace them have stalled, the National Research Council reports. ""These precipitous decreases warn of a coming crisis in Earth observations from space, in which our ability to observe and understand the Earth system will decline just as Earth observations are critically needed to underpin important decisions facing our nation and the world,"" according to a May report from the Academy's National Research Council. ""Advances in weather forecast accuracy may slow or even reverse, and gaps in time series of climate and other critical Earth observations are almost certain to occur."" NASA calls the report ""overly pessimistic,"" however. In a statement to CNN, the space agency says many of its satellites have lasted far beyond their expected lifetimes, and that scientists are getting regular data from other countries' probes. ""NASA is developing a set of missions that will both continue critical long-term data records and demonstrate new instruments and measurement approaches for important variables that are not presently being measured from space,"" it said. ""Our research portfolio remains robust."" The NRC report follows up on a 2007 study that recommended a list of 17 satellite missions for the next decade. But Dennis Hartmann, who led the committee that produced the new report, said none of those have launched ""because of a variety of reasons."" ""They didn't get as much money to use as the decadal survey assumed,"" said Hartmann, an atmospheric science professor at the University of Washington. ""Some things cost more, especially launch vehicles, so the overall cost has gone up."" Meanwhile, science budgets for both NASA and NOAA aren't keeping pace with inflation, he said, and NASA has lost two previously planned missions after liftoff. The 2009 Orbital Carbon Observatory was to have measured the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, while 2011's Glory would have measured solar radiation and atmospheric aerosols. Both crashed into the Pacific Ocean when the shell around the satellites failed to break away from the boosters. The kind of observations those probes send back are critical for climate researchers like Josh Willis, at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. Willis relies on radar imaging from the Jason-2 satellite, which monitors the rise in sea levels scientists say is a sign of a rise in global temperatures. Jason-2's expected lifetime is up in mid-2013, but its scheduled replacement, Jason-3, isn't likely to be launched until late 2014. If the current satellite goes out before the new one goes up, it would break a string of uninterrupted observations that date back to the early 1990s. ""One of the reasons it's so good and powerful is we've been able to link together the satellite records before the last one gets old -- we've been able to fly a new one and get some overlap,"" Willis said. ""What's important is not just what sea level is today, but how today's sea level relates back to the past."" The NASA-launched, NOAA-funded satellite, about the size of a refrigerator, scans nearly all of Earth's ocean surfaces every 10 days from about 800 miles up. It has been orbiting since 2008 -- and while its lifespan is officially five years, Willis said its predecessor Jason-1 is still functioning at 10. ""It's not super-healthy, but it's still collecting data and it's still being used,"" he said. Of the 17 recommended missions in the 2007 survey, 15 are still in the study and review phases, NASA spokesman Steve Cole told CNN. The remaining two are expected to launch by 2016, along with a replacement for the OCO. In the meantime, the space agency is using more aircraft flyovers to take the place of satellite observations of the Arctic and Antarctic. The program, known as IceBridge, is aimed at filling a gap between the shutdown of the ICESAT orbiter in 2010 and the espected launch of its successor, ICESAT II, in 2015. But the report by Hartmann's committee noted that the flights ""must leave unobserved large portions of the major ice sheets and sea ice"" until regular space-based observations resume. NASA is already running two other airborne missions and plans to announce more in the coming year, Cole said. And NOAA, which manages many of the satellite programs once the hardware has reached orbit, has also made arrangements to share data from a Japanese satellite launched last week. The first of a new series of NOAA satellites aimed at boosting the accuracy of long-range forecasts went into orbit in 2011, and it also carries instruments that monitor ozone levels, energy from sunlight and moisture in the air.","Tights budgets, growing costs and failed launches hurt satellite programs, report finds .

"(CNN) -- The United States couldn't do it on its first try. Neither could the Soviets. In true underdog fashion, India launched its ultra-budget spacecraft and bested the Americans and Europeans by becoming the first nation to succeed in sending a spacecraft into Mars' orbit on its initial attempt. Twenty-four hours into India's entry into the elite space club, the Mars Orbiter Mission, also known as Mangalyaan, is circling the Red Planet and sending back data and photos to the command center. Here are five things to know about the latest Mars darling: . 1. How India kept its Mars mission costs low . The much-repeated phrase is that the Mars Orbiter Mission at $74 million cost less than the $100 million budget for the Hollywood space thriller ""Gravity."" At least ""Gravity"" earned a few Academy Awards. India's Mars mission actually cost a lot less than most of this year's Hollywood summer flops -- some of which you probably don't remember. For example, the budget for Tom Cruise's flick ""Edge of Tomorrow"" could have funded two India Mars mission with its whopping $178 million budget. India has built a reputation for its frugal innovations. CNNMoney explains that the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) was able to save money by using short development cycles and taking advantage of India's cheap labor market. For example, highly-skilled aerospace engineers in India might receive a salary of $1,000 per month, a fraction of what they could earn in Europe or the U.S. 2. How quickly the Mars mission was pulled together . India's then-Prime Minister Manmohan Singh announced India's Mars aspiration in August 2012. In a rapid turnaround, the ISRO worked at breakneck speed to engineer, assemble and launch the Mars Orbiter. By November 2013, it launched from Chennai and 10 months later, it reached Mars' orbit to inspire a nation. From announcement to execution, the Mars mission took India's space agency two years and one month. In comparison, NASA's MAVEN was announced in September 2008, and reached the planet's orbit earlier this week -- taking six years. In a Forbes interview from 2013, ISRO Chairman Dr. K. Radhakrishnan said that India's space scientists commonly work 18-hour days and even 20-hour days during launch period, which made them more time and cost effective. 3. The purpose of India's space mission . The Mars spacecraft will orbit the Red Planet, mapping its surface and studying the atmosphere. The observation has already begun using its scientific instruments, according to ISRO. For much of its 50-year history, India's space program has prioritized developing technological capacity to help its population, such as improving its telecommunications infrastructure and environmental monitoring with satellites. India's space program launched its first Earth satellite in 1975 and put an unmanned probe into orbit around the Moon in 2008. 4. It's winning the Internet . These days, if your spacecraft doesn't have a social account with a quirky personality, it might as well not exist. The Mars Orbiter's new Twitter account casually greeted NASA's Mars Curiosity, ""Howdy... Keep in touch."" It joined an elite club of recent space darlings like NASA's Curiosity and China's defunct Moon rover Jade Rabbit, whose popularity soared due to a blend of cheeky and scientific social media posts. 5. It's not without controversy . In a country where one in three people lacks basic amenities like electricity, not all could cheer India's interplanetary aspirations. The statistics are sobering: one out of three malnourished children in the world lives in India. It faces development, poverty, education and gender challenges. Some critics have said that India should channel its funds into helping people here on Earth. And another criticism is that one of Earth's biggest environmental offenders has ignored the costs to the planet to go explore another.","Mars Orbiter Mission is pride of India after its successful entry into Red Planet .

"His cartel helped give Ciudad Juarez its infamous reputation as one of the world's most violent cities. But no shots were fired when Mexican federal police captured alleged Juarez Cartel boss Vicente Carrillo Fuentes, authorities said Thursday. The 51-year-old kingpin was detained alongside a bodyguard in a ""discreet operation"" at a checkpoint in the northern city of Torreon, said Monte Alejandro Rubido, head of Mexico's National Security Council. The driver's license Carrillo Fuentes flashed at a checkpoint concealed his identity. But once he realized he'd been found out, Carrillo Fuentes admitted who he was, Rubido said. Carrillo Fuentes, known as ""El Viceroy,"" was one of Mexico's most wanted alleged criminals. U.S. authorities had been offering a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to his arrest or conviction. A list of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's most wanted fugitives describes Carrillo Fuentes as a former Mexican police officer and notes that he ""occasionally travels to El Paso, TX."" A State Department Narcotics Rewards Program description of the notorious drug lord describes him as a ""known user of narcotics"" who is ""believed to have had plastic surgery"" and may have scars around his face. Cartel's influence had been waning . In the United States, Carrillo Fuentes faces a number of charges, including drug trafficking, conspiracy, money laundering, tampering with a witness and ""ordering the intentional killing of individuals to prevent communication of information,"" the State Department said. There were five arrest warrants for his capture in Mexico, where authorities were offering a reward of 30 million pesos ($2.2 million). Analysts have said the Juarez Cartel's influence had been waning after a lengthy battle for territory with the Sinaloa Cartel. Some speculate that violence dropped in Ciudad Juarez, located across the border from El Paso, Texas, after the Sinaloa Cartel won the fight for control. But at one time, the Juarez Cartel was one of the most powerful in Mexico. Its former leader Amado Carrillo Fuentes was known as the ""Lord of the Skies"" because of the large fleet of jetliners he used to transport cocaine from Colombia to Mexico. He died while undergoing plastic surgery in 1997, leaving his brother, Vicente, in charge of the cartel. Arrest comes as government faces criticism . His reported arrest comes a week after another top cartel leader was caught. Authorities said last week that they arrested Hector Beltran Leyva, leader of the Beltran Leyva Cartel, while he was dining in a seafood restaurant in San Miguel de Allende. The high-profile captures come as Mexican authorities face fierce public criticism over a surge in violence in Iguala, where 43 students went missing during a recent night of shootouts. On Monday, the government ordered local police to lay down their weapons and sent federal forces to the area, where investigators have found mass graves full of unidentified human remains. Critics accuse local authorities of involvement in the grisly crime, and say the government hasn't done enough to solve it. So far, 34 people have been detained in connection with the case, including nearly two dozen local police officers, Mexican Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam told reporters Thursday. Hours later at another press conference, Murillo trumpeted news of Carrillo Fuentes' capture as the ""result of enormous effort by the federal government,"" noting that it shows how much authorities have strengthened their abilities in investigation and intelligence. ""He was one of the most important of the most important that Mexican justice had to capture,"" he said.","Mexican federal police have captured Vicente Carrillo Fuentes .

"For three weeks now, Hamas and Israel have been locked in a deadly battle. Each side points to the other for provoking the conflict, which has left scores -- mainly civilians -- dead. And yet, a cease-fire seems unlikely, in part because the sides don't feel they have accomplished their goals. What are the goals for Hamas, the organization that governs Gaza and is considered a terrorist organization by many Western powers? And what is it willing to settle for to end the bloodshed? What Hamas wants: . 1. The destruction of Israel. This mission is written into the preamble of Hamas' founding document: ""Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it."" It's a demand that is globally repudiated as outrageous. It is unrealistic for Hamas to think that it can somehow destroy Israel. As long as Hamas leaders latch on to that as an endgame, the result will be continued flare-ups for years to come. Some Hamas leaders have stated a willingness to accept peace with Israel under certain conditions, the Council on Foreign Relations notes in a report. For instance, they want Palestinian refugees to be able to return. But such voices are not being heard in the current conflict. If Hamas is incapable of destroying Israel, it might still be dedicated to scaring Israelis off the contested land, journalist Jeffrey Goldberg at The Atlantic posits. ""The goal of Hamas—the actual, overarching goal—is to terrorize the Jews of Israel, through mass murder, into abandoning their country,"" Goldberg wrote. ""If generations of Palestinians have to be sacrificed to that goal, well, Hamas believes such sacrifices are theologically justified."" CNN Middle East analyst Michael Oren, a former Israeli ambassador to the United States, suggests a different type of war -- a media campaign by Hamas. ""Hamas knows it can't destroy Israel with its rockets or tunnels, but it can create a legal and international situation where Israel can no longer legitimately defend itself,"" he said. Reports of civilian casualties in Gaza -- without the context of rockets being fired at Israel -- play into Hamas' media strategy, he said. 2. An end to the Israeli blockade. Although Israel withdrew its forces from Gaza in 2005 and dismantled Israeli settlements, Palestinians say they continue to live under occupation to this day. Palestinians argue that Israel still maintains effective control of Gaza, making it an occupied territory. Israel controls Gaza's borders, waters and airspace -- and oversees what goods make it into the territory. CNN's Ben Wedeman recently spoke with Ismail Haniyeh, who is essentially the prime minister of Gaza. The Hamas member gave his demands -- namely, an immediate end to what he called the Israeli aggression. He wants border crossings to Israel and Egypt opened. In a 2012 interview with CNN, Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal had a similar message. ""The resistance is a means to an end,"" Meshaal told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. ""The endgame is to end occupation but the international community is not enabling us to do this. They are biased towards Israel."" Hamas wants a cease-fire, Hamas spokesman Osama Hamdam said of the current conflict, but it wants assurances that the Palestinians will be able to live peacefully. ""No one is talking against having a cease-fire. But we want a fair cease-fire to protect our own people for a long time, to protect them from the Israeli military attacks, from the siege, from the arrests,"" Hamdam told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. 3. The release of prisoners. In 2011, a captured Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit, was released by Hamas in exchange for more than a thousand Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. Many have since been re-arrested. Dozens of other Palestinians were arrested in the aftermath of the June 12 kidnapping of three Israeli teenagers, an incident which precipitated the current fighting. There is a precedent of Palestinian prisoners being released in negotiations with Hamas. This demand by Hamas is also among the most straightforward it has presented. ""Israel is not respecting its commitment by releasing and then arresting prisoners released,"" said Zaki Chehab, a leading Arab journalist and political editor of Hayat. ""It's a sign that Israel has not respected its commitment."" The conditions that Hamas is making is not something unjustified, he told CNN. ""They have a right to make a request because they've been under siege."" 4. Rally support at home. Some analysts argue that Hamas is engaged in a battle with Israel to shore up support among Palestinians. Many Palestinians believe that Israel has no intention of finding long-term peace, and they are likely to support Hamas in greater numbers if they view the militants as standing up for their rights. ""Hamas gains strength from the feeling of many Palestinians of despair that they see settlement growth. They don't believe that Israel has any intention of giving them a state of their own. And so when Hamas says what good is there for us to accept Israel's right to exist since Israel will never give us a state anyway, that makes Hamas stronger,"" CNN political commentator Peter Beinart said. During the last prolonged outbreak between the two sides in 2012, many concluded that Hamas gained credibility at the expense of other Palestinian leadership factions, according to a Council on Foreign Relations report. In the period since 2012, Hamas has seen the number of governments friendly to it diminish, and its influence wane. ""Hamas finds itself in a very difficult situation, and has for a couple years now,"" writes Natan B. Sachs, a fellow at Brookings' Center for Middle East Policy. ""Since 2012, when Egypt was governed by a president from the Muslim Brotherhood (Hamas' parent organization), Hamas' fortunes have declined precipitously."" Strapped for cash and possibly losing popularity, Hamas operatives may have decided that they had little to lose in entering a conflict. It's possible, Sachs said, that Hamas militants may not always be under the control of its political wing, and that this current conflict is the result of Hamas losing control of its cadres.","Hamas has a number of stated goals .
Some, like the destruction of Israel, are repudiated globally .
Hamas also wants an end to Israeli control in Gaza ."
"Election authorities proclaimed Hugo Chavez's handpicked successor Venezuela's president-elect Monday, despite his challenger's demand for a recount. ""It was a result that was truly fair, constitutional and popular,"" Nicolas Maduro said, criticizing his opponent's refusal to concede. Maduro secured 50.8% of votes in Sunday's election, while opposition candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski won 49.0%, Venezuela's National Electoral Council said Monday. The South American country's top election official certified the results at a ceremony in Caracas, saying Venezuela's voting system had worked perfectly. Maduro, who billed himself throughout the campaign as Chavez's political heir, told supporters Monday that the former president's son-in-law would be executive vice president during his six-year term. Jorge Arreaza has been Venezuela's science and technology minister and is married to Chavez's daughter, Rosa Virginia. Earlier Monday, Capriles called on his supporters to protest and slammed Maduro as an ""illegitimate"" leader. ""If both sides have said that they want to count vote for vote, what is the rush? What are they hiding? Why do we have to accelerate the process?"" he said. ""What they want is for the truth not to be known."" Many of the opposition candidate's backers took to the streets Monday night, banging pots and pans to protest the government's refusal to recount votes. Capriles called on them to head to local election offices Tuesday. The head of Maduro's campaign accused Capriles of inciting violence. ""This man, Capriles, does not know how to lose,"" Jorge Rodriguez, the head of Maduro's campaign, told reporters Monday. Capriles' repeated demands for a recount left key questions about Venezuela's future unanswered Monday: Will Maduro's supporters stick behind him? Will tension in the deeply divided country boil over after the tight race? And will world leaders recognize the results? The presidents of Argentina, Bolivia and Cuba were among the leaders who offered congratulations to Maduro on Monday. But the head of a prominent regional body said he supported a recount. And a White House spokesman pushed for an audit of the results. ""The result as reported is extremely close,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters. ""The opposition candidate and at least one member of the electoral council have called for an audit, which ... in our view, seems like an important and prudent step to take."" Organization of American States Secretary-General Jose Miguel Insulza offered the support of the regional body's election experts for a recount ""in the context of deep division and political polarization."" Both Capriles and Maduro have urged supporters to remain peaceful but appeared to be bracing for an intense political fight. Tension mounts after tight race . Police and National Guard troops stood by, armed with tear gas, as protesters gathered in one Caracas neighborhood Monday night, witness Alejandro Astorman said. On state television, Maduro vowed to use an ""iron fist"" against any coup attempts and accused political opponents of trying to destabilize the country. On Sunday, Maduro said he would have nothing to hide if votes were recounted. On Monday, he said officials had already ruled that the results showing his victory were clear. ""It is the majority,"" he said. ""There is a majority that won, and there is a minority that we recognize and respect, even though many of them hate us."" Capriles stressed that Maduro must also recognize the political will of the millions of voters who supported the opposition. ""Here there is no majority,"" he said. ""There are two halves."" Sunday's closely watched election comes at a time of political polarization and uncertainty for Venezuela. It was the second time in just over six months that voters in the South American country cast ballots in a presidential vote. Chavez, who ruled Venezuela for 14 years, celebrated a triumphant re-election victory in October. After his death on March 5, authorities announced new elections to select his successor. 'I am not Chavez, but I am his son' Maduro, 50, has been Venezuela's interim leader since Chavez's death. When he registered to run for the presidency last month, he told supporters, ""I am not Chavez, but I am his son."" They weren't blood relations, but in one of his last public appearances, Chavez tapped Maduro as his replacement. ""My firm opinion, as clear as the full moon -- irrevocable, absolute, total -- is ... that you elect Nicolas Maduro as president,"" Chavez said in December, waving a copy of the Venezuelan Constitution as he spoke. ""I ask this of you from my heart. He is one of the young leaders with the greatest ability to continue, if I cannot."" It was the first time Chavez had named a successor. His comments dramatically changed the political landscape and became the basis for Maduro's push to ascend to the presidency after his mentor's death. Throughout the campaign, Maduro pledged to continue Chavez's efforts to build ""21st century socialism"" and said his platform consisted of following the former president's plan for the country. At rallies for Maduro, a recording of Chavez's voice belting out the national anthem boomed through loudspeakers. At one campaign event, he told supporters that Chavez appeared to him in the form of a little bird to give him spiritual support. And Maduro's official campaign theme song began with a militant drumbeat and Chavez's voice, endorsing his candidacy. Campaigns bracing for a battle . Capriles, 40, said he was pushing a more moderate approach, promising to continue social programs and improve the country's economy. The opposition candidate lost to Chavez in October's presidential vote, but he came within 10 percentage points of the longtime leader. It was a significant gap, but the closest any opposition candidate ever came to defeating Chavez during his rule. More than 78% of the 18.9 million Venezuelans registered voted in Sunday's presidential election, Lucena said. In Venezuela, elections officials said Sunday evening that the day had proceeded smoothly without major incidents. Authorities detained 43 people for alleged electoral crimes, Maj. Gen. Wilmer Barrientos told reporters. As polls were closing Sunday, Twitter accounts for Maduro and his party were apparently hacked with posts denouncing ""electoral fraud."" A group calling itself Lulz Security Peru claimed responsibility, while officials from Maduro's campaign criticized what they said were ""dirty tactics."" They blamed right-wing political opponents for the hacking.","Nicolas Maduro says the election was fair and constitutional .

"A wise man once said, ""I'm not wearing pants today."" Mind you, this wise man was me. And he wasn't particularly wise. Or manly. Nevertheless, if you're a long-time reader of this column -- or if you just heard about my recent ""produce aisle incident"" in the local news -- you know that I don't particularly care for wearing pants. But, alas, life often requires such things. Especially at work. Unless, of course, you enjoy filling your Outlook calendar with frequent visits to HR. (I can draw you a map of the ninth floor from memory.) Fortunately, however, a couple weeks ago, while wasting time on the Interwebs and avoiding any actual career accomplishments, I stumbled upon a possible compromise: Betabrand Dress Pant Sweatpants. They're just what they sound like. Dress pants ... that are actually sweatpants. ""Betabrand, you had my curiosity. But now you have my attention."" When they finally arrived in the mail, upon first glance, my Dress Pant Sweatpants seemed to be the real deal. They looked good and they felt good -- pretty much as advertised. They're kind of pricy at $100, but I was amazed. Chris Lindland, founder and CEO of Betabrand, explained to me that these aren't your everyday sweatpants. ""We found a French terry fabric that looks like classic charcoal wool,"" he says. ""A designer suggested that we make classic dress pants -- but a whole lot more comfortable."" Thus, on Monday, I literally walked into the office wearing sweatpants. ""Look at you in your slacks."" That's what my startled co-worker Nick said when he strolled past my cubicle, likely assuming that I either had a job interview or another ""workplace decency meeting"" on the 9th floor. A little while later, Rick stopped by. ""You're all dressed up today."" Again with the praise. Now, I'm not sure if this says more about me and the fact that I normally look like a homeless man, or more about the pants, but the fact remains that I was basically wearing what I slept in, yet somehow getting mega compliments. From dudes. Guys don't normally notice each other's pants, so clearly we had breached some sort of man dam. And when I started soliciting opinions from ladies in the office, it was the same thing. Everyone thought I looked really clean. And nice. And less woke-up-in-a-gutter-y. So, the pants work. From both near and far, they look just like regular trousers, what with pockets and belt loops and that second, inside waist button that lets you know you're bein' all fancy-like. My only real complaint was that they were a bit warm. Not terrible. But definitely warm. I'm told a lighter pair is being developed for the spring and summer. But I was fine, and at one point in the day, I sat down with a female co-worker to further explore the Betabrand website. You know, a little clothes shopping. What could possibly go wrong? Aaaaaand that's when we stumbled upon this word: Vagisoft. Apparently, this company also sells something called Vajamas, and this was the adjective used to describe their unique level of fluffiness.

""Where a Soft-o-Meter can measure and compare the suppleness of things like freshly laundered bunnies and the cotton fields of heaven. We simply abide by what the Soft-o-Meter tells us."" I have no idea what this means, but on their website there really is a Soft-o-Meter image to confirm that, yes, these unisex Vajama pajama pants are softer than ""the anus of a silkworm,"" yet not quite as soft as ""the womb of a marshmallow mermaid.""

""This is where we post sketches and get feedback from customers,"" Lindland says. ""The most popular products are turned into prototypes, which our customers then crowdfund into existence."" It takes about two to three months for a new design to go from the funding stage to actually being in stock. ""If people fund 'em, we make 'em.""

"Apple will unveil the latest version of its iPhone on September 10, according to a new report. The news comes from All Things D, the Wall Street Journal-affiliated tech blog that has a solid track record for reporting inside Apple information. Apple is believed to be working on a smartwatch and a TV, but neither of those products are expected to be ready for rollout at next month's event. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Likely to be called either the iPhone 6 or iPhone 5S, the phone's release date would fit the schedule Apple has established since the first iPhone was released in 2007. The company has released a new iPhone model every year, and the release dates have all been in the summer or fall. The iPhone 5 came out in September 2012, the iPhone 4S in October 2011, and the three versions before that in the summer months. The release date is the most recent, and probably one of the most accurate, rumors that precede this Apple release. The upcoming Apple event will come at a unique time for the tech giant, which has dominated the smartphone and tablet markets for almost as long as they have existed. Android-based phones like Samsung's Galaxy S4 have put a dent in iPhone sales, while some critics have said the latest updates to the iPhone and iPad lack significant innovation. READ: How Samsung is out-innovating Apple . The new iPhone will run iOS 7, the latest version of Apple's mobile operating system, which includes new typography, redesigned icons and a new color palette. Here's a roundup of some of the speculation swirling around the next iPhone. As always with such things, take it all with a grain of salt. Leaks along Apple's supply line have become more frequent, but that doesn't mean all of them turn out to be accurate. --The new phone will likely be the iPhone 5S and keep the same design as the current iPhone 5. The iPhone 4 was followed by the 4S, which maintained the same form. --The company will also roll out a cheaper version of the iPhone, largely for sale in emerging markets. Reuters reported that it will cost $99 and come in five or six different colors. It may or may not be called the iPhone 5C. Apple Senior Vice President Phil Schiller has tossed cold water on this idea, though Apple is known for misdirection in advance of new product releases. --Since there will be a cheaper iPhone, Apple will discontinue production of older models. --There will be at least one larger iPhone model, with a 4.7-inch screen, a 5.7-inch screen, or both to compete with big-screen rivals from Samsung, HTC and other makers. --The new phone will have a fingerprint scanner for added security and other uses. --As usual, it will have a faster processor, longer battery life, and an improved camera. Not much of a stretch there -- all of these upgrades are typical of any gadget update. Again, it remains to be seen which of these rumors and reports pan out. And Apple can be counted on for at least a few surprises.","Report: New iPhone coming on September 10 .

"(CNN) -- Russian police detained dozens of people in an anti-terror sweep in Volgograd, the southern city where two suspected suicide bombings killed more than 30 people this week. Thousands of police officers searched hundreds of people following the attacks on Sunday and Monday at a rail station and on a trolley bus just six weeks before Russia is due to host the Winter Olympics. The death toll from the attacks increased to 34 when some of those hurt died from their injuries, state media reported. Separately, Australia announced limits on the movement of its athletes for the Sochi Games. The blasts in Volgograd intensified fears of terrorism following a threat earlier this year from a Chechen extremist group to use ""maximum force"" to disrupt the Olympics in February. No group has claimed responsibility for the attacks described as suspected suicide bombings. In his New Year's address, Russian President Vladimir Putin acknowledged problems in 2013 but said the Russian people had a lot to look forward to in 2014. He also had a message for terrorists. ""We bow our heads to the victims of violent terrorist attacks. We will continue the fight against terrorists certainly, fiercely and consistently until their complete annihilation,"" he said in the address on Russian TV. In Volgograd, a strong security presence was on the streets leading to New Year's Eve celebrations. Australian restrictions . Australia said Tuesday that none of its athletes competing in the Olympics will travel to Sochi using ground transportation in Russia -- they will only travel by air. Australian athletes will only train and compete in Sochi and won't vacation elsewhere in Russia after the Games, said John Coates, the president of the Australian Olympic Committee. ""Families of athletes and all other participants of the Olympic Games, including media and spectators, should note the steps we are taking for the safety and welfare of our athletes,"" Coates said in a statement on the committee's website. He nonetheless echoed comments from the International Olympic Committee expressing confidence that Russian authorities will do everything ""to ensure the security of the athletes and all of the participants of the Olympic Games."" Key transit point . While security in Sochi and its surrounding area is considered to be very tight, the attacks in Volgograd, a major transportation hub for southern Russia, have raised concerns about the potential vulnerability of other areas of the country. Volgograd is a main transit point for people traveling by train to Sochi, which is situated just over 400 miles (645 kilometers) to the southwest. The number of people killed in an explosion at the Volgograd's main rail station Sunday now stands at 18, the state-run news agency RIA Novosti reported Tuesday, citing the Emergencies Ministry. The toll from a blast on a trolleybus during the morning rush hour Monday has reached 16, the agency said, attributing the information to health officials. Russia's response . Russian authorities have described both explosions as terrorist attacks and vowed to continue their ""tough and consistent offensive"" against extremists. About 5,200 police officers are now on the ground in Volgograd for an anti-terrorism operation, Andrei Pilipchuk, a regional police official, said on Russian television. Police are checking people's documents in all crowded areas of the city and have so far detained 87 people who put up resistance or didn't have documents allowing them to carry weapons, Pilipchuk said. But it wasn't clear if any of those held had any suspected connection to the attacks or would face any charges. A total of 1,500 buildings have been ""examined"" and more than 1,000 people have been searched in the operation, Pilipchuk said. U.S. offers support . The United States has offered its ""full support to the Russian government in security preparations for the Sochi Olympic Games,"" National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said in a statement Monday. ""We would welcome the opportunity for closer cooperation for the safety of the athletes, spectators, and other participants,"" Hayden said. The U.S. State Department said American citizens planning to attend the Games should ""be reminded that threats have been made against the Olympic Games and acts of terrorism, including bombings, continue to occur in Russia."" ""This is an exciting, positive, happy international sporting event, but people going there do need to maintain vigilance and watch out for their own security and safety,"" Marie Harf, a State Department spokeswoman said at a regular briefing Monday. Harf said the department was ""very focused"" on the security situation in Russia, but she declined to say whether any additional measures had been taken since the Volgograd bombings. CNN's Diana Magnay and Arkady Irshenko contributed to this report.","NEW: Thousands of Russian police officers carried out searches in the city .

"An ultra-marathoner trying to ""run"" from Florida to Bermuda in a human-powered inflatable bubble was rescued Saturday morning after he signaled for help, the Coast Guard said. Reza Baluchi, according to his website, has set a goal of running across more than 190 recognized nations to encourage world peace. CNN ran a story about him in 2012. The Coast Guard first encountered Baluchi on Wednesday after receiving a report about a man in a bubble off the coast of Miami, disoriented and asking for directions to Bermuda, a Coast Guard press release said.  It was not clear when he started his quest. A Coast Guard cutter found Baluchi. Officials described the craft as a ""hydro pod bubble"" and a man in a 2013 YouTube video called a Baluchi bubble ""a big hamster wheel."" It moved along the ground as Baluchi ran inside. In the press release, the Coast Guard said Baluchi had protein bars, bottled water, a GPS and a satellite phone. The Coast Guard conveyed the voyage's dangers and asked Baluchi to quit his journey because he didn't have enough supplies. But he wouldn't leave his vessel, officials said. The Coast Guard monitored his progress and on Saturday morning  an exhausted Baluchi activated his personal locating beacon, the Coast Guard said. A Coast Guard HC-130 airplane and MH-60 helicopter, along with the vessel Maersk Montana, were sent to rescue Baluchi 70 nautical miles east of St. Augustine, the Coast Guard said. He was exhausted and taken to the Coast Guard air station in Clearwater, where his medical condition was evaluated. There were no reported injuries, the Coast Guard said. ""Part of his effort was to make world peace but he got caught up in the Gulf Stream,"" said Coast Guard public affairs specialist Mark Barney. ""The chances of muscling out of the Gulf Stream were pretty low."" Baluchi could not be reached for comment, but a video posted on Baluchi's Facebook page described his plans to travel in the bubble across the Caribbean, as well as his other athletic exploits. The CNN.com story quoted Baluchi saying he'd run across the United States twice and around its perimeter once. He fled Iran to escape persecution, he said. Now he is an American citizen. ""Reza doesn't listen to anyone,"" Davis Hyslop, a businessman and one of Baluchi's supporters, said in the 2012 story. ""He has these outsized ambitions that he sets his mind to. He's a success above and beyond anyone's expectations. It's almost biblical. But you gotta be a little crazy to undertake such an endeavor, right?""","Coast Guard: Man was traveling from Florida to Bermuda in a large bubble .

"Nearly 7 in 10 Americans are angry at the direction the country is headed and 53% of Americans disapprove of President Barack Obama's job performance, two troubling signs for Democrats one week before the midterm elections, a new CNN/ORC International Poll shows. Democrats are battling to try and save the Senate majority, while hoping to prevent more losses in the House, which the GOP controls by a 234 to 201 margin. In the Senate, Republicans need a net gain of six seats, and several state polls in the past month of contested races show that Democrats are in danger of losing control of the majority, and thus Congress. Currently, Democrats control the Senate by a 55-45 margin with two of those seats held by independents that align themselves politically with Democrats. The CNN/ORC poll shows that 30% of Americans are ""very angry"" and 38% are ""somewhat angry"" about the way things are going in the country, while 31% expressed ""no anger"" at all. CNN Polling Director Keating Holland notes the 31% of ""very angry"" Americans matches the mood of the country in 2010 when Republicans took back control of the House. In next week's election, the emotion of anger could be a motivating factor in driving out GOP voters. While 36% of Republican voters said they are ""extremely"" or ""very enthusiastic,"" about voting this year, only 26% of Democrats use that language to describe themselves, in the CNN/ORC poll. ""That 10 point difference is certain to affect turnout and hurt Democrats' chances in marginal districts,"" Holland said about the 435 House races on the ballot next Tuesday. And this enthusiasm gap, coupled with dissatisfaction over how the president is leading the country, is likely to influence the dozen races that will decide which political party controls the Senate for the next two years. A deeper look into the polling data shows that Obama's job performance is only viewed favorably in the Northeast, 51%, and in urban areas, 60%. All but one of the races that will decide which party controls the Senate in 2015 are located in the three other geographic areas of the country and Obama's approval rating is in the low 40's in each one. ·  In the Midwest, where Democrats are trying to hold an open Senate seat in Iowa, Obama has a 56% disapproval rating. ·  In the South, where three Democratic incumbents are battling for re-election in Arkansas, Louisiana, North Carolina, and Republicans are trying to hold an open seat in Georgia, as well as protect Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in Kentucky, the president has a 52% disapproval rating. ·  In the West where Democratic incumbents are fighting for another six year term in Alaska and Colorado, Obama's disapproval rating is 55%. Making matters even more difficult for Democrats is that Obama's disapproval rating among rural voters is 70% and the eight states listed above have sizable rural populations. Nationally, when asked if they agree with Obama on issues that matter most to them, only 42% said yes, while 55% said they disagreed with him, in the poll. POLL: Coakley trails GOP challenger in Massachusetts . It is no surprise that Obama has purposely stayed away from campaigning for Senate candidates in difficult contests. It is widely believed that Democratic seats in Montana, South Dakota, and West Virginia will be won by Republicans in November. If this were to happen, Republicans will only need a net gain of three more seats to take back the Senate majority. As for Congress, only 13% of Americans approve of how it is handling its job, while 85% disapprove.","A new CNN poll finds large swaths of Americans angry at the direction of the country .

"It isn't that the man had done anything wrong to infuriate Elytte Barbour and his wife. The couple - married three weeks -- just wanted to kill someone together, police said. And Troy LaFerrara, 42, happened to be the unlucky one. The Barbours are accused of luring LaFerrara through a ""companionship"" ad on Craigslist, and stabbing and strangling him to death. Barbour told police he and his wife had tried to kill others. But the plans didn't work out. ""This,"" said Sunbury Police Chief Steve Mazzeo, ""happened to be one that worked."" The ad . LaFerrara's body was found in the backyard of a home in Sunbury, a small city about 100 miles northwest of Philadelphia, on November 12. He had been stabbed 20 times and strangled, police said. The last number dialed on his cell phone led police to the Barbours. At first, the wife, Miranda Barbour, 18, denied knowing the victim. But presented with more and more evidence that police had gathered, she confessed. According to the police affidavit, this is what happened: . Miranda Barbour told police she would use Craigslist to meet men -- ""men who wanted companionship,"" and were willing to pay her for it. On November 11, she met LaFerrara at a mall, picked him up in her red Honda CR-V and drove to Sunbury. Elytte Barbour was hiding under a blanket in the back seat, he said. The couple had agreed on a pre-arranged signal so that he would know when ""it was time to kill the victim."" The death . After driving for a while, Miranda Barbour pulled over. LaFerrara reached over and began touching her, she said. She then took a knife from between the front seats and stabbed him, she said. Once, twice, three times. She told police she doesn't remember how long she went on. LaFerrara tried to fight her, but couldn't. Elytte Barbour had tied a cable cord around his neck to hold his head back. As LaFerrara fought, Elytte Barbour said he held tight. The discovery . While they drove around looking for an an out-of-the-way spot to dump the victim, LaFerrara was still alive. He was ""choking and gasping for air,"" Miranda Barbour told police. But soon, his breathing stopped. The couple dumped LaFerrara's body by the back garage of a house in Sunbury -- which is where resident Brittany Settler discovered it the next morning. ""I was making myself a cup of coffee and when I opened the fridge to get the creamer out,"" the Sunbury resident told CNN affiliate WHP. ""I looked out and was like, 'What is that?'"" She walked over to the garage behind her house and saw the body. LaFerrara's face was purple. He had his keys in his hand. And there was blood everywhere. The cleanup . With the body gone, the Barbours' stopped at a Wal-Mart, bought garbage bags, carpet cleaner, paper towels and seat covers. They needed to clean up the sports utility vehicle. ""She related that there was a lot of blood and she wasn't able to get it all,"" police said. After they were done, they went to a strip club. It was Elytte Barbour's 22nd birthday. The reaction . In Sunbury, violent crime is rare, Chief Mazzeo said. ""We don't usually have homicides up here. This is a relatively peaceful town,"" he said. ""We average a homicide maybe every 18 months to two years, so this is unusual."" The killing was the talk of the town over the weekend. ""It's surprising, and it's shocking, and it's unfair,"" Sunbury resident John Mickey told affiliate WNEP. ""The man had a family. It's devastating. It really is."" Nancy Sholley was LaFerrara's neighbor. He was married. ""I just really feel sorry for (his mother),"" Sholley told the affiliate. ""She's a nice woman. We have always thought a lot of her. Just really, my heart goes out to her."" ""Evil is all over,"" she added. ""It is."" The charges . The Barbours were married October 22, the husband told the Daily Item newspaper. The pair moved to Sunbury from North Carolina, where he worked as a dishwasher. Strapped for cash, his wife would meet ""unhappy men"" online and charge up to $850 for ""delightful conversation,"" he said. It's believed that Miranda Barbour had Craigslist encounters with at least 30 different men, according to a source close to the investigation. Police are trying to find those men, the source said. The couple face a host of charges including criminal homicide, which is similar to first-degree murder. ""The defendant stated that they committed the murder because they just wanted to murder someone together,"" police said, referring to Elytte Barbour. Miranda Barbour was denied bail and has a court hearing set for December 20. CNN's calls to her public defender were not returned Saturday night. Elytte Barbour has a court date set for December 17.  He is not yet represented by an attorney. ""We started with nothing,"" Mazzeo told CNN on Saturday. ""We started with a dead body with no ID on it, dumped in somebody's backyard, no relation to anything in the area or the people who lived there. ""To close out this particular homicide in three to four weeks, that's pretty impressive."" But their work is far from over. In the coming days, ""we are going to try to resolve some of the loose ends,"" he said. Among them is this: Miranda Barbour has a 1-year-old child. The couple has told police the child's father is deceased. That death is now a part of the investigation. Ohio man convicted for three murders in Craigslist job ad killings .

"In back-to-back speeches Tuesday to the U.N. General Assembly, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, of seeking to obtain a nuclear weapon, and the Iranian representative insisted that Tehran's nuclear program was intended solely for peaceful purposes. Rouhani, whose demeanor has been more moderate than that of his predecessor since he took office in August, is ""a wolf in sheep's clothing, a wolf who thinks he can pull the wool over the eyes of the international community,"" Netanyahu said. Western leaders have expressed optimism about Iran's more moderate tone under Rouhani, whose recent comments have raised hopes that a deal could be struck over the Middle Eastern nation's nuclear program. But Netanyahu urged world leaders not to be duped by Rouhani, calling him a ""loyal servant"" to the Islamic regime, which he said ""executes political dissidents by the hundreds"" and jails them by the thousands. CNN Poll: Most in U.S. favor negotiations with Iran over nukes . ""It's not hard to find evidence that Iran has a nuclear weapons program,"" Netanyahu said. ""It's hard to find evidence that Iran doesn't have a nuclear weapons program."" Netanyahu said that even since Rouhani assumed office, ""this vast and feverish effort has continued unabated."" Rouhani ""thinks he can have his yellowcake and eat it, too,"" Netanyahu said in a reference to the raw uranium ore that can be processed into nuclear weapons. International sanctions have left Iran ""on the ropes,"" the Israeli prime minister told the world body, whose Iranian representative was not present. He called for the sanctions to remain in place to force Iran to halt its nuclear aspirations. ""We all want to give diplomacy with Iran a chance to succeed,"" he said. ""But when it comes to Iran, the greater the pressure, the greater the chance."" But the Iranian representative rejected Netanyahu's accusations, calling them ""inflammatory"" and ""unfounded."" Iran ""has an inalienable right to peaceful nuclear energy"" and is fully committed to its nonproliferation obligations,"" said Khodadad Seifi, counselor for Iran's U.N. mission. ""All Iranian nuclear activities are -- and have always been -- exclusively for peaceful purposes,"" he said, adding that Tehran is cooperating with the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and that its work is carried out under surveillance cameras. ""There is no single acceptable reason to possess nuclear weapons, but there are many agreeable reasons to abolish them all,"" he said. He called further for ""respectful"" negotiations. ""Iran stands ready to ensure that its nuclear program will continue to remain exclusively peaceful,"" he said. Seifi also called for the international community to annul the sanctions that have crippled the nation's economy. And he noted that Israel, unlike Iran, has not signed the nonproliferation treaty. ""Israel is the only one in the region that possesses all types of weapons of mass destruction but is not party to any of the treaties banning them,"" he said. And he warned Netanyahu that Tehran is capable of defending itself if Jerusalem's war of words goes beyond vitriol. ""The prime minister had better not even think about attacking Iran, let alone planning for that,"" he said. Iran nuclear talks are key topic . Netanyahu's comments drew a sharp response from Mustafa Barghouti, a member of the Palestinian Liberation Organization's Central Council and head of an independent political party. ""Why does he forget to speak about the facts and also ignores the facts that Israel is also a nuclear power and the way to peace in the Middle East is to make it a free nuclear zone?"" he asked. Tuesday's repartee came a day after U.S. President Barack Obama met with Netanyahu in the White House and a few days after he spoke with Rouhani by telephone in the first such direct contact between the nations' leaders since the Iranian revolution in 1979. On Monday, Obama said he has a ""good working relationship"" with Netanyahu, and reaffirmed the U.S. bond with the Israeli people. ""Our unshakeable bond with the Israel people is stronger than ever,"" he said. ""Our commitment to Israel's security is stronger than ever."" Both leaders said Iran was a key topic. ""Iran is committed to Israel's destruction, so for Israel, the ultimate test of a future agreement with Iran is whether or not Iran dismantles its military nuclear program,"" Netanyahu said. ""That's the bottom line."" Obama said that if Iran wants sanctions relief, it will have to meet ""the highest standards of verifications."" ""It is absolutely clear that words are not sufficient,"" Obama said on Monday. ""We have to have actions that give the international community confidence that, in fact, they are meeting their international obligations fully and that they are not in a position to have a nuclear weapon."" In the latest indication of Tehran's new approach to Washington, Iran's semi-official Fars News Agency reported that Rouhani wants to establish direct flights between Iran and the United States. And in the latest indication of Iran's continuing problems with Israel, the Israeli government said over the weekend that it had arrested an Iranian-born man and accused him of spying for Tehran. According to the Israeli government, the alleged spy was carrying photos of various sites, including the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv. On Tuesday, the Iranian news agency cited a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman who rejected the assertion as ""baseless.""","Iranian envoy rejects accusations as ""inflammatory"" and ""unfounded""

"Remember those ""Where's Waldo"" books? You know, the ones featuring a bespectacled, beanstalky character dressed in a red-and-white striped shirt -- and hiding in massive crowds. Objective: find him, turn page. A fascinating online project is using that same spot-that-one-thing construct to try to save rhinos and other wildlife from poaching at a wildlife reserve in Namibia. Part of the MicroMappers effort, the Namibia project gathered 500 volunteers -- ""digital rangers,"" in the group's parlance -- over the weekend to sift through aerial photos looking for wildlife. The goal was to survey more land more quickly than on-the-ground rangers could, and to consequently protect rhinos and the like from poaching or other threats. The online army of volunteers, which included people from dozens of countries, surveyed more than 25,000 aerial photos shot by drones from Friday to Sunday, according to the group's website. They circled wildlife they found, and uploaded their findings. Volunteers could spend as much or as little time as they wanted. ""It is challenging but a really fun challenge,"" Patrick Meier, director of social innovation at the Qatar Computing Research Institute, which was behind the project, wrote in an email to me. ""(It) makes me feel like a digital Indiana Jones or Sherlock Holmes."" So, pick your metaphor: Waldo, Jones or Sherlock. It's cool no matter how you describe it. The effort grows out of Meier's work with Ushahidi and others to help citizens map and analyze data in response to natural disasters, like the 2010 Haiti earthquake. It also builds on the citizen science movement, which seeks to involve everyday people in real scientific endeavors, from analyzing whale songs to mapping the structure of proteins. I love these projects -- not just for their do-gooder potential, but also because they encourage people to get involved in the news, and to learn something new about the world. As Meier put it: ""Hopefully now people know where Namibia is on the map!"" (Sub-Saharan Africa, by the way, northwest of South Africa and south of Angola). I also reported on the illegal wildlife trade in Southeast Asia earlier this year for CNN's Change the List project, so the project hit a chord with me for that reason, too. The black market trade in wildlife is massive -- $5 billion to $20 billion per year, according to Defenders of Wildlife. Rhinos are in particular trouble lately. It's a worthy issue and, as Meier explained, an important test of a ""micro-tasking"" platform that could be used to tackle other crises, including disaster response. I asked Meier to answer a few questions about the Namibia wildlife project over email. The following is a copy-paste version of that conversation, edited for length and clarity: . Sutter: ​​What's the name of the project and who's behind it? Meier: It's called MicroMappers, a joint initiative between the Qatar Computing Research Institute and the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). In terms of the MicroMappers Wildlife/Namibia deployment, this is a joint collaboration with the Qatar Computing Research Institute, Drone Adventures, Kuzikus Wildlife Reserve, Polytechnic of Namibia, and l'École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne. Sutter: How did it come about? Meier: As a digital humanitarian response to Typhoon Pablo in the Philippines 2012. We had experimented with micro-tasking to analyze pictures posted on Twitter to support the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs' rapid damage assessment efforts. After this largely successful response, OCHA called me up and asked me if I'd be ready to replicate this effort (micro-tasking) in future disasters. More recently, given the increasing use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, or drones) in humanitarian response, we decided to develop the Aerial Clicker. The purpose of the Aerial Clicker is to crowdsource the analysis of aerial imagery for disaster response. The Qatar Computing Research Institute wanted to test the new Aerial Clicker -- but not in the middle of a disaster. Given our existing collaboration with Drone Adventures (a group aiming to help citizens map the word with drones), I approached the latter and offered to help their partners in Namibia analyze their aerial imagery. This would help the rangers assess whether crowdsourcing could support their future wildlife monitoring and protection work while helping us test the Aerial Clicker in a nondisaster situation. Sutter: The MicroMappers said over the weekend that about 500 ""digital rangers"" participated in this project. Who are they -- what sorts of day jobs do they have, etc? Meier: It's hard to say since many don't sign in to volunteer but, anecdotally, a combination of digital humanitarian volunteers and individuals who are interested in wildlife protection, from all ages and walks of life. I know that several U.S. schools are involved, since several teachers got in touch with me earlier. Here's a note I got from a woman who is participating: . ""I am very grateful and looking forward to being even a small part of MicroMappers.  I donate to National Geographic and also make purchases that benefit conservation of land and the animals that habitate them, including purchases of the book 'Tigers Forever,' etc. It was always my dream to go to Africa to help the wildlife in any way I could, but realistically that is not possible for most. So thank you so much for helping me to participate in this program, and giving us, the public, an opportunity to help,  hopefully this can be another step towards stopping the poachers."" Sutter: What's the end goal? Or what big questions are you hoping will be answered? Meier: The big questions we're hoping to answer: Can the crowd accurately identify and trace features of interest in high resolution aerial imagery captured by (drones)? Is the Aerial Clicker ready for prime time (i.e. a deployment during a disaster)? Are the resulting traces of high quality enough to develop machine learning classifiers to potentially semi-automate the identification of features in future deployments? Sutter: Where do the images come from - and who will analyze the findings? Meier: The images come from Drone Adventures. We will analyze the results together with the rangers at Kuzikus Wildlife Reserve. Sutter: This seems like adult ""Where's Waldo"" to me -- but, I guess, with a purpose? Meier: Yes, ""Where's Waldo"" with a purpose. Incidentally, one of our next pilots will likely be later this year in the Philippines. A local UAV partner, called SkyEye, is doing some great work around the use of UAVs for disaster response. After major typhoons in the Philippines, one important element of disaster damage assessment is to determine how many coconut trees have been uprooted/destroyed since this impacts local livelihoods and food security. To date, SkyEye has had to manually count destroyed coconut trees in the many aerial pictures they take. So what we want to do is to upload these images to the Aerial Clicker and launch a similar challenge to determine whether the crowd is able to accurately identify said coconut trees. We're also interested to explore whether these resulting traces can be used to create a machine learning classifier for destroyed coconut trees. In general, one of the main use cases for the Aerial Clicker is infrastructure damage assessment. That said, given the interest around the Namibia challenge, it's clear that our Clicker (and the other Clickers) could be used for applications beyond disaster response. In fact, an archaeologist who uses UAVs as part of his work got in touch to ask about potentially using the Aerial Clicker and crowdsourcing as part of his archaeology projects. We're psyched about all the other possible applications and keen to explore these and partner with others. This is very much in line with the mandate and focus of the social innovation program that I direct at the Qatar Computing Research Institute. Sutter: Have you gone digital game hunting yourself? Is it hard? Meier: Yes I have (although I wouldn't use the word hunting). It is challenging but a really fun challenge -- makes me feel like a digital Indiana Jones or Sherlock Holmes. There are all those computing games for kids (mostly) that ask players to find certain hidden objects in made-up pictures. It's all fictitious but this (wildlife challenge) is real, so you can have fun while doing something meaningful and learning a few things in the process. Hopefully, now, people know where Namibia is on the map! And have learned a few things about wildlife issues in the country. Sutter: Tell me how this effort fits into the bigger picture - both in terms of the crowdsourcing movement and environmental science? Meier: I've come into this from the digital humanitarian side of things but there are obviously important overlaps with citizen science, which is why I've spent quite a bit of time learning from the pros in citizen science, like Zooniverse. (I'm collaborating with them on this other project, by the way, and we're hoping to pilot the initiative very soon). Zooniverse is really great for large-scale citizen science deployments. In our case, MicroMappers seeks to support the ""long tail"" of citizen science or digital-humanitarian projects, i.e. those projects which simply don't require hundreds of thousands of volunteers but rather a few hundred to a few thousand. That's where we fit in the bigger picture. Sutter: Is this new? Or how does it push things forward? Meier: Crowdsourcing the analysis of aerial imagery for wildlife protection is certainly new. I haven't heard of any other project like this. But what MicroMappers really pushes forward is how easy it is to become a digital humanitarian or a digital ranger, for that matter. The Clickers are specifically designed so that anyone can volunteer without prior experience or special skills. With MicroMappers, we're looking to democratize the digital humanitarian experience.","Online project aims to help protect rhinos and other wildlife in Namibia .

"The peace of prayer time at a mosque in Aleppo was shattered Wednesday when Syrian army planes bombed the site, killing and injuring several worshippers, activists said. Tama Hazem, head of the Aleppo Media Center, said Nour Al-Shuhada mosque was struck during Asr, the third Islamic prayer of the day. ""The scene was of complete devastation. The main hall of the mosque and the minaret were destroyed and many of the wounded were in critical condition,"" Hazem said. ""There was no reason to target this mosque and it is not the first one to be targeted in the neighborhood. There is no FSA base in the mosque and it was not frequented by rebels,"" he said, referring to the rebel Free Syrian Army. The opposition Local Coordination Committees also said warplanes dropped TNT barrels on the mosque in the neighborhood of Shaar. Opposition activists say more than 30,000 people have been killed since March 2011, when anti-government protesters took to the streets calling for political reform and an end to four decades of Assad family rule. The government responded with a violent clampdown, spawning an armed conflict that has spiraled into a civil war. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government has insisted it is fighting ""armed terrorist groups."" CNN cannot independently confirm reports of casualties in Syria because the government has restricted access by international journalists. Turkey, Syria trade fire . Turkey and Syria traded artillery rounds along their borders, Turkish authorities said. Hatay governor's office in Turkey said that a mortar shell landed in a field near Hacipasa hamlet of of Altinozu town Wednesday afternoon.  Turkish border forces retaliated immediately. The office said that there were no casualties in the incident. Tensions have heightened between the two countries. Turkey, once a friend of the al-Assad government, now opposes the regime. There have been a flurry of cross-border incidents. Turkey hosts more than 100,000 Syrian refugees and opposition leaders. More than 150 dead . At least 155 people died Wednesday, most of them in Damascus and Aleppo, according to the LCC. The reported toll in and around Damascus was 48, with another 46 killed in Aleppo, Syria's commercial capital, the group said. Rebels fighting regime forces in Idlib province ""inflicted heavy losses"" and downed a helicopter, but the LCC reported earlier that at least 24 people had been killed there. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said its forces killed many ""terrorists"" across the country. It reported the assassination of a Damascus province official. Mohammad Ayman Taja was shot dead as he was leaving his house in the Rukn Eddin area of Damascus city. Brahimi visits Lebanon on cease-fire mission . Scrambling to find a solution to Syria's bloody civil war, international envoy Lakhdar Brahimi visited Lebanon and campaigned for a cease-fire in Syria. During his brief stop in Beirut, Brahimi met with Lebanese President Michel Suleiman. Later Wednesday, Brahimi was expected to visit the Syrian capital of Damascus. Over the course of his regional tour, the U.N.-Arab League envoy to Syria has been trying to broker a cease-fire for the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha next week. ""People bury one hundred persons a day, and if this number is reduced during Eid, it may be a start to bring Syria out of this dangerous situation that is has slipped and continues to slip into,"" Brahimi said, as reported by the Lebanese National News Agency. UK man charged over photographers' kidnapping in Syria . Eid al-Adha, which commemorates the Muslim prophet Ibraham's willingness to sacrifice his son for Allah, is one of two major holidays in Islam. The other, Eid al-Fitr, marks the end of Ramadan, when Muslims fast from dawn to dusk. But if history repeats itself, the odds of any cease-fire are stacked against Brahimi. His predecessor, Kofi Annan, made numerous trips to Damascus but was unable to halt the incessant violence. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, whose government supports the al-Assad administration, proposed the observation of a truce on Eid al-Adha, Iranian media outlets said. ""In our view, ceasefire and dialogue for free elections is the right solution,"" Ahmadinejad told reporters at the Asia Cooperation Dialogue summit in Kuwait City. The U.S. election and the price of sitting out Syria. Stop arming Syrians, Brahimi tells world . Brahimi backed U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's call for countries to stop arming the different sides. ""God willing, this would be a start to get out of the Syrian crisis, and of course this won't be easy,"" he said to the Lebanese news outlet. ""These countries should know that this crisis won't be confined within the Syrian borders forever. If not resolved it will deteriorate."" There is mounting concern over a foreign presence in Syria, such as Hezbollah and Iranians fighting for the al-Assad regime. CNN has learned that British authorities think dozens of British citizens have gone to Syria, some of whose motivation is to wage jihad. Not all of them are planning to join the Free Syrian Army, which is becoming increasingly hostile to the jihadist elements fighting al-Assad's army. There are concerns that jihadists are getting battlefield training and experience in Syria that they could bring back and use on targets in Great Britain.","Activists report 155 deaths in Wednesday's fighting .

"(CNN) -- Eight Florida teenagers -- six of them girls -- will be tried as adults and could be sentenced to life in prison for their alleged roles in the videotaped beating of another teen, the state attorney's office said Thursday. The teenagers seen in a video assaulting a 16-year-old could face life in prison. The suspects, who range in age from 14 to 18, all face charges of kidnapping, which is a first-degree felony, and battery, said Chip Thullbery, a spokesman for the Polk County state attorney. Three of them are also charged with tampering with a witness. Everyone involved in the case was under a gag order imposed by a judge. The only attorney for the teens who has been publicly identified did not return calls from CNN, and his assistant cited the gag order as the reason. The teens are scheduled for their first appearance in court Friday. The video shows a brutal scene: The 16-year-old victim is punched, kneed and slapped by other girls. She huddles in the fetal position, or stands and screams at her attackers, but the assault continues. Authorities say the eight teens said they were retaliating for insults posted on the Internet by the attack victim. Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd called the March 30 attack ""animalistic."" ""I've been involved in law enforcement for 35 years, and I've seen a lot of extremely violent events, but I've never seen children, 14 to 18 years of age, engage in this conduct for a 30-minute period of time and then make these video clips,"" he said. Police say the teens planned to post the video on YouTube.  Watch the disturbing video » . The victim, a 16-year-old from Lakeland, Florida, was hospitalized, and still has blurred vision, hearing loss, and a swollen face, her mother told CNN on Wednesday. The video shows only girls doing the beating; Judd said the boys acted as lookouts. The idea of girls administering a vicious beating so they can post the video online may seem shocking, but it's becoming an increasingly common scenario, according to experts and news reports.  Watch why more teens are putting fights online » . A search for ""girl fight"" on YouTube gets thousands of results, and a suggestion to also try ""girl fight at school, boy girl fight"" and other search terms. There's at least one Web site devoted exclusively to videos of girls fighting. In 2003, 25 percent of high school girls said they had been in a physical fight in the past year, according to a survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (The figure for boys was 40.5 percent.) A Justice Department report released in 2006 showed that by age 17, 21 percent of girls said they had assaulted someone with the intent to cause serious harm. Frank Green is executive director of Keys to Safer Schools, a group that studies and tries to prevent school violence. He said he's not sure whether girls have actually become more violent, or whether there's just more awareness of their fights. ""In one respect, girls have always been more vicious than boys,"" Green said. ""Their violence is of a personal nature."" He said boys usually have some focus and a concrete goal when they fight. ""But girls want to cause pain and make the other girl feel bad,"" he said. Judd, the Polk County sheriff, said an important part of the plan in the Lakeland attack was to post the video of the beating on YouTube to humiliate and embarrass the victim. ""It's the next stage of cyberbullying,"" psychologist Susan Lipkins said. ""They want to show what they're doing."" ""Our kids are being peer pressured, in another sense of a trend, to put these shock videos out there at other peoples' expense,"" said Talisa Lindsay, the victim's mother. ""And I hope that it doesn't come to the point where there's more people's lives that are being affected by having to take a beating for entertainment, or possibly being killed.""  Watch mother describe how the victim is doing » . The suspects didn't have a chance to post the video online before police moved in and seized it, Judd said. The Sheriff's Department made it public, and it wound up on YouTube anyway. Judd recognizes the irony. ""In a perverted sense, we were feeding into exactly what the kids wanted,"" he said. ""But according to Florida law, [the video] is public record, and it's going to be in the public domain whether we agree with that or not."" Judd said the suspects showed no remorse when they were arrested and booked. ""They were laughing and joking about, 'I guess we won't get to go to the beach during spring break.' And one ... asked whether she could go to cheerleading practice,"" he said. Lipkins, the psychologist, says there's a ""disconnect between their actions and their thoughts."" ""They think the entire society is doing it, and they think it's funny. So they put it on YouTube. And I don't think they expect kids to get really hurt, and they also don't expect to get really caught."" E-mail to a friend .

"One of America's most prominent diplomats over the past 25 years, Ryan Crocker, was charged this month with drunken driving and being responsible for a hit and run in Washington state, according to documents obtained Thursday by CNN. Crocker -- who in 2009 received a Presidential Medal of Freedom, the top civilian honor bestowed in the United States, and until last month was his nation's ambassador to Afghanistan -- was arrested August 14 in Spokane, Washington, a case docket provided by the Spokane County prosecutor's office showed. According to Washington state Trooper Troy Briggs, Crocker hit another vehicle about 2 that afternoon, spun out, regained control of his car, then kept on driving eastbound. A witness followed Crocker to a bank several miles up the road, where authorities arrested him about 45 minutes later, the police spokesman told CNN on Thursday. The driver of the other vehicle, a tractor-trailer truck, was not injured,  Briggs told CNN affiliate KXLY. But Crocker's own car had ""significant"" damage, including a flat tire. Crocker was given the option of taking a breath test and he accepted, with the tests indicating blood-alcohol content levels of 0.160 and 0.152 -- well above 0.08, Washington's legal limit for driving -- according to Briggs. Police placed Crocker in custody for driving under the influence and hit-and-run of an attended vehicle, citing him for both alleged violations and releasing him later that day. The next day, the recently retired diplomat pleaded not guilty in court to the two charges and was released on his own recognizance, a probable cause/conditions of release order filed in Spokane County shows. Conditions of his bail, as outlined August 15, include refraining from committing any crimes and consuming alcohol or drugs except as prescribed by a doctor, the court docket states. Crocker was also ordered to go to a drug testing office within 24 hours and undergo alcohol testing twice a month. His next court date is set for September 12. A Spokane-based lawyer who the court docket indicates is representing the 63-year-old Crocker did not immediately return a phone call for comment Thursday. Born in Spokane, Crocker grew up in a military family and went to schools in Morocco, Canada, Turkey and the United States, according to his U.S. State Department biography. Soon after graduating in 1971 from Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington, Crocker joined the U.S. Foreign Service. Among other posts, he was at the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, during Israel's 1982 invasion of that country and the bombings of the embassy and Marine barracks the following year. All troops now armed at NATO office . The U.S. ambassador to Lebanon between 1990 and 1993, Crocker spent the next three years as America's top diplomat in Kuwait and the three years after that as its top representative in Syria. After U.S.-led forces forced the Taliban out of power, he was given the task in 2002 of reopening the U.S. Embassy in Kabul. Following the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, Crocker held a top job with the Coalition Provisional Authority, which ran Iraq for 14 months from 2003 to 2004 after the ouster of its longtime leader Saddam Hussein. Crocker served as U.S. ambassador to Pakistan from 2004 to March 2007, at which point he became the country's ambassador to Iraq. In 2009, he left the foreign service and became a professor at Texas A&M University. Obama to talk to Karzai about attacks . But he rejoined the diplomatic ranks on July 25, 2011, as U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan. He oversaw America's diplomatic presence during a period of transition and continued fighting between NATO-led troops and the Taliban, as well as occasional friction between U.S. leaders in Washington and Afghan leaders in Kabul. About 10 months later, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland announced Crocker would step down due to unspecified ""health reasons in mid-summer."" ""He took it for two years, but the serious health problem he had in Iraq came back, so he is forced to leave a year early for genuinely serious health reasons,"" a senior U.S. administration official told CNN in May  on condition of not being identified. At the time, Nuland indicated that Crocker would stay on through conferences in Kabul and Tokyo aimed at shaping the international approach to going forward in Afghanistan. The latter meeting took place last month. According to a U.S. State Department website, his term ended July 13, 2012.","Police say Crocker hit a vehicle, spun out, then drove away from the scene .

"(CNN) -- Barcelona failed to keep pace in the La Liga title race with record breaking Real Madrid Saturday after being held goalless at Getafe. With the pressure on after Real's 4-1 win at Almeria, its 20th straight, Barca just could not find the way past the home defense. It trails its arch-rival by four points with Real headed to Morocco Sunday to play in FIFA's Club World Cup. ""The draw isn't a great result,"" Barcelona captain Xavi Hernandez told AFP. ""There's still a long way to go in the league, but admittedly it's a step backwards,"" he added. The Catalan giant was missing Brazilian star Neymar through an ankle injury but otherwise fielded a strong side in the Coliseum Alfonso Perez . Luis Suarez -- still searching for his first La Liga goal for his new club -- went close in the first half after turning an effort just wide, while both sides had penalty appeals for handball turned down. Lionel Messi almost broke the deadlock after the break but saw a free kick rattle the crossbar and he also headed over from a good position. It was a rare failure to register on the score sheet for Messi, all the more galling after his scoring rival Cristiano Ronaldo scored a late double in Real's victory the previous evening. Ronaldo had been a largely peripheral figure for 80 minutes until adding two fine late strikes to earlier goals from Isco and Gareth Bale for the European champions. It took his tally in La Liga to 25 for the season. Garcia Rabasco had given Almeria hope with a thumping strike to level Isco's opener and Real also had Iker Casillas to thank for saving a second half penalty to keep his side in front. Chelsea continues to set a hot pace in the English Premier League, bouncing back after a 2-1 defeat to Newcastle last weekend to beat 10-man Hull 2-0 at Stamford Bridge Saturday. Eden Hazard put Jose Mourinho's men ahead early, but the home side was helped by the controversial dismissal of Hull's Tom Huddlestone's for a challenge on Filipe Luis on the hour mark. Diego Costa wrapped up the three points with his 12th of the season soon afterwards. It left Chelsea three points clear of reigning champion Manchester City, who continued its fine recent form with a 1-0 victory at bottom side Leicester City. Former Chelsea star Frank Lampard scored the winning goal for City, his 175th in the EPL, in the first half. But the visitors lost Edin Dzeko and Vincent Kompany to worrying injuries ahead of the busy Christmas program in England. Third-placed Manchester United is now eight points behind its city rival ahead of a crunch home match against Liverpool Sunday. Bayern Munich's march to yet another Bundesliga title continues unchecked, thrashing Augsburg 4-0. It left Bayern 10 points clear of Wolfsburg, the second-placed side playing Paderborn Sunday in an attempt to close the gap. After a goalless first-half, visitors Bayern dominated after the break as Dutch ace Arjen Robben netted twice while Medhi Benatia and Robert Lewandowski were also on target. Meanwhile, Bayern's traditional rival Borussia Dortmund slipped back into the relegation zone with a 1-0 defeat at fellow struggler Hertha Berlin. Former Dortmund player Julian Schieber scored the only goal of the match against his old club, who slip to 16th with only four wins from 15 Bundesliga games this season.","Barcelona held to 0-0 draw at Getafe .
