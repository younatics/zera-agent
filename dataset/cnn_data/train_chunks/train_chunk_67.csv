"(CNN) -- Filippo Inzaghi rescued a point for AC Milan as they drew 1-1 against Catania at the San Siro, Saturday. The goal was Inzaghi's 123rd for the club and puts him just one behind the club record of 124 held by Dutchman Marco van Basten. Milan, who opened their 2010 Champions League campaign with a 2-0 win over French side Auxerre in midweek, failed to spark in a disappointing display. Ciro Capuano gave Catania the lead in the 27th minute before Inzaghi equalized just before half time. Fiorentina lost for the second weekend running, beaten 2-1 at home by Lazio. Nineteen-year-old Adem Ljalic handed Fiorentina the lead when he scored from the penalty spot in the 19th minute. But goals from Argentine Cristian Ledesma in the 32nd minute Czech international Libor Kozak scored the winner after 67 minutes sealed Fiorentina's fate. The result leaves them languishing near the bottom of the table in 17th place. Meanwhile in Spain's La Liga, Michael Laudrup enjoyed his first win in charge of Real Mallorca as they beat Osasuna 2-0 at home on Saturday. Mallorca registered their first goal of the season with a Chori Castro penalty after 25 minutes, awarded for a handball by Osasuna's Miguel Flano. The islanders made sure of the win deep into injury time with a goal from by Dutch midfielder Jonathan de Guzman. The result moves Mallorca up to seventh in La Liga. Elsewhere, Espanyol moved up to third place in the table after they defeated Almeria 1-0, courtesy of a Jose Callejon goal after 47 minutes. Athletic Bilbao came from two goals down to draw with Sporting Gijon. Gijon were two nil up within 25 minutes thanks to goals from Miguel de las Cuevas and Argentine Gaston Sangoy. But Bilbao responded with goals from Carlos Gurpegui in the 29th minute followed by an equalizer on the hour mark from Spanish international Fernando Llorente.","Wins for Real Mallorca, Espanyol and Athletic Bilbao snatch draw with Sporting Gijon .

"(CNN) -- Everton scored in the last minute of stoppage-time to claim a 3-3 draw against Manchester United in the Premier League at Goodison Park on Saturday. United, who did not field the former Everton player Wayne Rooney, looked to be cruising to a comfortable 3-1 victory after goals from Darren Fletcher, Nemanja Vidic and Dimitar Berbatov had erased Steven Pienaar's opener for Everton. But with 90 minutes up, Everton scored two late goals, the first a header from Tim Cahill and the second by Mikel Arteta, to secure a point for Everton manager David Moyes's men. Everton, who were third from the bottom of the table at the start of the day, had taken the lead on 39 minutes when a misjudged clearance from United defender Patrice Evra left Arteta clear on goal. Arteta's effort was saved by Edwin van der Sar, but Leon Osman found the unmarked Pienaar who guided the ball to the back of the net. But Everton's advantage was short-lived as United swept forward and found an equalizer moments later. The Portuguese winger Nani curled a cross from the right into the danger area and Fletcher popped up to steer home the leveler. United maintained their momentum after the restart and Nani was the creator once more, his pinpoint cross picking out Vidic whose downward header flew past Tim Howard in the Everton goal. Victory seemed all but assured on 66 minutes when Paul Scholes split the Everton defense to release Berbatov, who controlled before burying a low shot beyond Howard. But Cahill's header gave Everton hope and moments later Arteta's deflected shot flew in to give the home side an improbable point in what was Sir Alex Ferguson's 700th Premier League game as a manager. Ferguson said: ""Football can do that to you. In a game of a completely comfortable position we've thrown it away, simple as that."" Meanwhile Premiership leaders Chelsea maintained their perfect start to the season with a 3-1 win over West Ham. Two goals from Michael Essien and a Salomon Kalou strike helped the Blues to a relatively comfortable win against a struggling West Ham at Upton Park, East London. Carlo Ancelotti's men preserved their two-point lead at the top of the table with their fourth win of the season, condemning West Ham to their fourth defeat and a place at the bottom of the table. Arsenal stayed in touch at the top with a 4-1 rout of 10-man Bolton at the Emirates stadium in North London, with summer signings Laurent Koscielny and Marouane Chamakh both getting on the scoresheet for Arsene Wenger's side. Koscielny had fired the Gunners, second in the table,  into a 1-0 lead on 24 minutes but Wanderers hit back through Johan Elmander on the stroke of half time after good work by South Korea international Lee Chong-Yong. Moroccan international Chamakh restored Arsenal's lead however, capitalizing on good work from skipper Cesc Fabregas. Bolton's task was made harder when Gary Cahill was given a straight red card for a wild lunge on Chamakh before goals from Alex Song and and Carlos Vela sealed the points. At Eastlands, Manchester City's faltering form continued as they were held to a 1-1 draw by Blackburn Rovers. A dreadful mix-up between England goalkeeper Joe Hart and Kolo Toure saw City fall behind, Nikola Kalinic sneaking in to put Blackburn 1-0 up. However City got back on level terms early in the second half when former French international Patrick Vieira netted a vital equalizer for Roberto Mancini's team. Newly promoted Blackpool earned their second victory of the season with a 2-0 defeat of Newcastle at St James Park. A Charlie Adam penalty and a late goal on the counter from DJ Campbell helped Ian Holloway's Tangerines to all three points.","Everton score in stoppage-time to draw 3-3 with Manchester United .

"(CNN) -- Mercedes are set to introduce a raft of measures to revive Michael Schumacher's flagging Formula One fortunes for the upcoming Spanish Grand Prix. The seven-time champion returned to F1 this season after retiring in 2006 but has struggled so far, accumulating only ten points in the opening four races of the campaign. But Mercedes team principal Ross Brawn says changes to Schumacher's car, including a new chassis and improved weight distribution, could help reignite his bid for a record eighth championship in Barcelona. ""It's not a new chassis per se, it's a chassis we used in testing,"" Brawn was quoted as saying on the official F1 Web site. ""The one he had got damaged during the first few races, and we repaired it as best we could at the races. But now we are back at base we are going to re-introduce the test chassis, and he will be using that in Barcelona. ""It has taken Michael a little time to settle into these cars and particularly the tires. These tires are very different to what he had last time he was racing."" Schumacher is being outperformed by Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg, who has battled his way to second in the standings. But Brawn is confident the 41-year-old will be pushing the front runners soon. ""It's foolish to say Michael is where he wants to be, but he's very determined to succeed,"" Brawn said in comments attributed to Reuters.com. ""I think these frustrations are just going to make him try even harder. ""We've not had a fantastic start but we are still in there because no-one else is really dominating either - there is still plenty of opportunity. ""He is so determined, and you can see that in his driving. The bits where it's not quite working are not because of [lack of] skill or bravery, it's because the technique needs tuning, and the car needs tuning. ""It's odd places where he's losing time and that's why we think he'll sort it out and we'll sort it out.""

"(CNN) -- The CEO of the Hungarian company behind a huge toxic spill on Thursday said he doesn't know whether he's responsible for the disaster, but added, ""I have moral duties and I will fulfill them."" Zoltan Bakonyi, the chief executive of the MAL aluminum plant, spoke with CNN's Diana Magnay a day after he was released from jail pending trial. Bakonyi was detained on Monday, accused of public endangerment and harming the environment. ""It's said I should be responsible although I don't feel it,"" Bakonyi told Magnay. He insisted that MAL was in compliance with all Hungarian safety regulations and pointed out that he has only been CEO for two years. Bakonyi argued that the problems presented by the reservoir and the accumulation of toxin in it stretched back 25 years or more. But he added that it is his ""moral duty"" is to ""help"" and put his energies ""120-percent into the aid effort."" Bakonyi categorically denied that a hole was present in the reservoir in the days or weeks before the spill happened. Bakonyi said he had visited the reservoir in the weeks before the spill happened. But, he said he hadn't seen the photo released by the The World Wildlife Fund showing one of the pools of sludge -- a byproduct of the process to turn bauxite ore into aluminium oxide -- leaking into a nearby field. The WWF says the photo was taken in June. Bakonyi also denied the spill was a consequence of overproduction or improper payment of workers. He maintained that there was no way to anticipate the accident. ""The only way anyone could have imagine this happening,"" he said, ""was in a terrorist attack."" MAL has ""an idea"" about how the spill occurred, but Bakonyi won't comment on what it is. He says no statement on causes will be released until Hungarian authorities complete their own investigation. The Hungarian government announced Wednesday that MAL would resume operations by the end of the week. Meantime, as cleanup operations continued, workers were racing to complete three emergency dams designed to contain a possible second toxic spill from the plant. Hungarian emergency services officials said more ruptures and cracks are evident in the dam walls, and that it's just a matter of time before they break and spill an additional 500,000 cubic meters of toxic red sludge across the countryside. Nine people died after a river of mud engulfed the villages of Kolontar, Devecser, and Somlovasarhely last week. More than 100 people were injured and many times that number had to be evacuated. The sludge from the spill reached the Danube -- Europe's second-largest river -- within days, raising fears of wider contamination in Hungary and countries downstream, including Croatia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania and the Ukraine. But water rests released Friday found that the pH level of the Danube water was only slightly higher than normal. EU toxins experts still have nothing conclusive on the exact chemical composition of the sludge. Aluminum and bauxite processing normally involves compounds that include arsenic, cyanide, cadmium and chromium.

"CNN -- The Williams team has called on Formula One bosses to review the safety-car rules after Sunday's controversial European Grand Prix in Spain. Nine drivers were given post-race penalties for speeding while the safety car was on duty following a horrific crash involving Red Bull's Mark Webber, who was lucky to escape the incident unhurt. After seeing Williams driver Rubens Barrichello incur a five-second penalty after finishing fourth in Valencia, the team's technical director Sam Michael said the sport needs to reassess the rules. ""In this regard the [safety car] regulations probably need a review, rather than clarifying,"" he told Formula One's official website. ""From a personal perspective, I was in favor of the old system when you could duck and dive into the pits under the safety car in order to win advantage, but I also appreciate that the current rules are there to promote safety."" Ferrari President Luca di Montezemolo told the team's official website that he hopes motorsport's ruling body, the FIA, takes ""necessary decisions"" in a race he described as ""unacceptable."" Lewis Hamilton of McLaren was also penalized in Spain for illegally overtaking the safety car to retain second position before pitting. Championship leader Hamilton was later able to take a delayed drive-through penalty without losing his second place, allowing him to earn 18 valuable points. Vettel cruises to victory in Valencia . Fernando Alonso, who finished eighth in Valencia, said the controversial incident involving Hamilton gave Ferrari a disadvantage over one of his team's closest rivals. ""It was unfair -- we respected the rules and didn't overtake under the yellow flag,"" Alonso told reporters. ""They gave the penalty but a bit too late -- 20 laps to investigate one piece of overtaking."" This is not the first controversial incident this season regarding the safety-car rules. Confusion surrounded the Canadian Grand Prix after Mercedes driver Michael Schumacher passed Alonso during the end of lap 78 while the safety car was still on the track. Latest F1 championship standings . Despite the seven-time world champion pleading his innocence, the FIA stewards deemed the move illegal, handing him a post-race 20-second drive-through penalty which saw the German fall from sixth place to 12th. Last week the FIA attempted to clarify the incident by saying that no driver is allowed to overtake the safety car when it is deployed at the beginning of, or during, the final lap. However, the incidents at the European Grand Prix have now cast further doubt on the way the sport is governed. Montezemolo said the race was in danger of damaging the sport's credibility. ""Ferrari, which showed itself to be competitive in the European Grand Prix, paid a price that was too high for respecting the rules,"" he told Ferrari's official website. ""Meanwhile, those who didn't follow the rules were penalized by the race officials in a way that was less severe than the damage suffered by those who did respect them."" ""That is a very serious and unacceptable event that creates dangerous precedents, throwing a shadow over the credibility of Formula One.""","Williams' Sam Michael calls for the FIA to reassess the current safety-car rules .

"(CNN) -- Titleholders Inter Milan gave newcomers Tottenham a Champions League lesson on Wednesday night before the English club's young winger Gareth Bale underlined his status as one of football's most promising prospects. Inter moved three points clear at the top of Group A after leading 4-0 inside 35 minutes, but needed to withstand a late onslaught as Wales international Bale scored a second-half hat-trick. The Italians went ahead after just 68 seconds as captain Javier Zanetti calmly sidefooted past Heurelho Gomes from a Samuel Eto'o pass, and the Brazilian goalkeeper was sent off six minutes later for bringing down winger Jonathan Biabiany. Eto'o buried the resulting penalty once Gomes finally departed, having been twice shown a red card, as the Cameroon striker beat replacement keeper Carlo Cudicini for his 13th goal in 12 games this season. Inter midfielder Dejan Stankovic made it 3-0 in the 14th minute with a shot from the edge of the area as Inter's crisp passing once again bamboozled the Tottenham defense. Eto'o, reveling in his central role in the absence of the injured Diego Milito, scored his second with a shot which deflected under Cudicini's body after he ran on to teenager Philippe Coutinho's measured throughball. While the 18-year-old Coutinho showed his class in the first half, he was upstaged by Bale in the second. The 21-year-old took the ball from inside his own half before lashing a fierce left-foot shot past Inter keeper Julio Cesar seven minutes after the break, and repeated the effort in the 90th minute as he easily outpaced the 37-year-old Zanetti. Bale then sealed his first Tottenham treble with yet another left-foot shot from almost the same position after being teed up in the area by Aaron Lennon, but Inter held on for victory and seven points from three outings. Werder Bremen boosted Tottenham's hopes of reaching the second round by coming from behind to draw 1-1 away to Dutch champions Twente, leaving both teams on on two points. Midfielder Theo Janssen put the hosts ahead in the 75th minute, but Austrian forward Marko Arnautovic equalized against his former team five minutes later. Barcelona, the 2009 champions, returned to winning ways with a 2-0 victory over Copenhagen. Argentine superstar Lionel Messi scored in each half to put the Spanish team a point clear of the previously unbeaten Danish side at the top of Group D. David Villa hit the crossbar before the diminutive forward broke the deadlock from with a ferocious shot from just outside the area in the 19th minute, and Messi then had an effort ruled out for offside before halftime. Barca survived a scare as Copenhagen's Dame N'Doye also smashed a shot against the bar, while Dani Alves hit the post for the Catalans before Messi sealed the win from close range right at the end. Copenhagen are four points ahead of Rubin Kazan, with the Russian champions drawing 0-0 away to Panathinaikos to end the Greeks' run of two defeats. Manchester United shrugged off the absence of wantaway striker Wayne Rooney to beat Turkish side Bursaspor 1-0 at home and move two points clear in Group C. With England star Rooney out injured, Portugal midfielder Nani staked his claim to take over as the team's key player with a superb seventh-minute winner in front of a crowd of more than 72,000. Scottish club Rangers held onto second spot after being held 1-1 at home by Valencia, with the Spanish side coming from behind to earn the draw as U.S. international Maurice Edu scored for both teams. The midfielder nodded in a 34th-minute opener from a cross by Vladimir Weiss, but turned villain just after halftime when he headed Tino Costa's free-kick into his own net. Lyon took control of Group B, with the French side beating 10-man Portuguese champions Benfica 2-0 for a third successive victory. Forward Jimmy Briand headed home the opener in the 22nd minute, then the visitors had Argentine midfielder Nicolas Gaitan sent off for a second yellow card just before halftime. Briand turned provider six minutes after the break, with Argentine forward Lisandro Lopez scoring at the second attempt after his initial header was blocked. Veteran Spanish striker Raul helped lift Schalke's spirits as he continued his remarkable scoring run in Europe in a morale-boosting 3-1 win over Hapoel Tel Aviv. Schalke, struggling in the German league's relegation zone, moved three points clear of Benfica with a second victory of the competition, with Raul netting twice to equal Gerd Muller's record of 68 in European club matches. The 33-year-old Real Madrid star has now scored in 15 successive seasons, his first coming in the third minute and his second in the 58th before Jurado made it 3-0 soon after. The Israelis managed a late consolation through Itay Shechter, but lie rock bottom after three defeats.","Inter Milan lead 10-man Tottenham 4-0 before halftime before Gareth Bale's hat-trick .

"(CNN) -- Heavyweight champion Vitali Klitschko shrugged off taunts from WBC challenger Shannon Briggs on Monday after the American threatened to end his fellow veteran's days in the boxing ring. If trash talk counts, then the 38-year-old Briggs has a fighting chance of inflicting the Ukrainian's third career defeat in his fifth defense of the belt in Germany on Saturday. He barely let his 39-year-old opponent get a word in at the start of a press conference in the older Klitschko brother's adopted home city of Hamburg. ""I really feel for you, but you have made a bad choice. You are going to meet an adversary that you have never met before. I can hit, box and dodge my opponent's punches,"" boasted Briggs, who lost to Lennox Lewis when he challenged for the WBC title in 1998. ""I have never prepared so well for a bout. When I have finished with Vitali, they can bring on Wladimir immediately."" Klitschko, who has previously hinted that this will be his final year of boxing, was relaxed when he had the chance to reply to his rival, who briefly held the WBO title in 2006. ""It is not easy to find an adversary for me or my brother. Shannon accepted immediately to fight me and I thank him for that,"" he said. ""But when I hear him say he is going to propel me into retirement, that just makes me laugh. ""I am ready and I am going to show that I deserve to wear this belt, which has been worn by [Mike] Tyson, Lewis and Muhammad Ali."" Klitschko is less pleased with WBA champion David Haye, who has opted to face fellow British fighter Audley Harrison on November 13 rather than fight either of the Ukrainian duo this year. ""David Haye is just chicken, to be honest. He's got a big mouth but nothing more. David Haye is the world's biggest trash talker,"" he told the Fanhouse website. ""But he's smart enough to understand that if David Haye made the contract with Vitali or Wladimir Klitschko, and he got inside the ring with either one of us, then it would be the finish of his boxing career.""","Shannon Briggs talks up his chances of winning the WBC title from Vitali Klitschko .

"(CNN) -- Patrice Evra has failed in his appeal against a five-match supension from the French national team. The French Football Federation imposed the ban for Evra's part in the France squad's training boycott during the World Cup finals in South Africa. Manchester United left-back Evra, who was captain of the side, contested the suspension but on Thursday, his punishment was upheld by the FFF appeals  commission. An FFF statement read: ""The superior appeals commission, which met today to consider the appeal by Patrick Evra, decided to uphold the sanction of five matches of non-selection for the France team handed down on August 17 by the federal disciplinary commission. Evra's lawyer Jean-Yves Foucard told reporters: ""Patrice Evra wanted to express himself, which he did at great length, and the commission listened to him very attentively, and asked good questions. ""Patrice explained that he fulfilled his role with transparency and honesty, always trying to smooth the differences between the players and the staff, and particularly the coach. You can understand, you can imagine that these relationships were not simple."" Evra was one of four players banned following France's World Cup debacle in which they failed to qualify for the last 16 of the competition, collecting just one point in three matches. Nicolas Anelka, who was sent home after a row with coach Raymond Domenech was handed an 18-match suspension, while Franck Ribery received three and Jeremy Toulalan a single game. Only Evra appealed against his ban and the result means that he is not eligible to play for France until their friendly match against Brazil in February.","Patrice Evra fails in his appeal against a five-match ban from the French national team .

"(CNN) -- Members of the Indonesia military may have been involved in the torture of two men in the country's province of Papua, a government official said on Friday. The incident came to light after a video surfaced showing men burning the genitals of a naked and bound man, and holding a knife to the nose and neck of another bound man on a dusty road while interrogating them. ""The investigation is still going on but initial reports I received from the armed forces commander, show that there were elements of the military who were involved in those excessive, unprofessional acts, that were clearly a violation of human rights, Indonesian Coordinating Minister for Political and Security Affairs Djoko Suyanto told CNN. The video is believed to be from the Indonesian province of Papua, nearly 3,500 kilometers east of the capital, Jakarta. Papua has long had a low-level insurgency that demands independence from Indonesia, saying the government is trying to take its land to steal resources. But both victims in this case were unarmed farmers, the Alliance of Papuan students told CNN. The scenes were recorded on a cell phone, and the imagery brought stiff condemnation from human rights groups who believe the video is possible evidence of Indonesian armed forces torturing members of independence movements. Human rights groups say that while they haven't determined the authenticity of the video, they have clues that the persecutors are members of the Indonesian armed forces. For example, the weapon being used in the video appears to be a standard military issue and the questions posed by the interrogators are consistent with those of Indonesian security forces, said Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch's Asia division. Human Rights Watch is concerned that the government will let the case linger without a resolution. Another video surfaced this year showing a disemboweled Papuan political activist being taunted by men in police uniforms. Police denied allegations that their forces disemboweled him. They said he was injured in a firefight, and no officer has been disciplined in that incident. The indigenous Free Papua Movement was established in 1965 to push for the secession of Papua from Indonesia. The group disputed the terms under which Papua became a part of Indonesia that year. Papua has the largest gold mine in the world, operated by the U.S.-based Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, but members of the freedom movement say locals have not received fair economic benefits from any of the mining operations on their homeland.","A group says both victims were unarmed farmers .

"Vitali Klitschko has confirmed that he will defend his world heavyweight boxing title against former champion Shannon Briggs on October 16 in his adopted home city of Hamburg.

The 39-year-old, who has successfully defended the crown four times, will face the American, 38, for the first time as he seeks to extend his 40-2 career record. ""I am really happy that I will have a fight in Hamburg again, the place where I started my professional career.

"(CNN) -- Another wonder strike from in-form Dutch winger Arjen Robben proved enough to give Bayern Munich a narrow 1-0 Champions League semifinal first leg win over Lyon, in a match which saw both sides reduced to 10 men. Robben, who scored a hat-trick in Bayern's 7-0 thrashing of Hannover, continued where he left off last weekend by scoring the only goal in the 69th minute. Picking the ball up 25 yards from goal, Robben's impressive strike took a slight deflection off the head of teammate Thomas Muller to wrong-foot goalkeeper Hugo Lloris. Bayern were the better of the two sides, but they suffered an early setback when midfielder Franck Ribery, whose name has been linked to an alleged sex scandal in his native France, was sent off for a late challenge on Lisandro in the 37th minute. Ribery lunged in with studs showing, catching Lisnadro on his ankle, and Italian referee Robert Rosetti had no hesitation in producing a straight red card, meaning the Frenchman will now miss the second leg in Lyon next week. However, nine minutes after the break, Lyon's man advantage disappeared when Jeremy Toulalan, who had been booked for a foul on Robben just three minutes earlier, was shown a second yellow card for a high challenge. Lyon had endured a long trip by road and rail to get to Munich and, like Barcelona in Milan 24 hours earlier, they appeared tired and lethargic throughout the majority of the match.","Bayern Munich defeat Lyon 1-0 in the first leg of their Champions League semifinal .

The wide-ranging three-part interview continues with the second installment on Cooper's ""AC360"" Wednesday night. In the interview, Ono spoke about being unfairly blamed for the breakup of the Beatles and how she can't forgive Mark David Chapman, the maniacal fan who fatally shot Lennon in 1980. She also strolled with Cooper through Central Park's Strawberry Fields, dedicated to Lennon and named after the song ""Strawberry Fields Forever,"" written by Lennon and fellow Beatle Paul McCartney. Lovers of Lennon's music should celebrate his 70th birthday anniversary, which occurred October 9, by remembering his expansive spirit, Ono said. ""I know that people loved him for what he has given them because he did give a lot. And all his beautiful ideas, they're not like seeds in their hearts that grow: We all have this huge, huge forest of ideas that we share,"" she said. ""I would say that let's not think about the fact that he passed away, but let's think about, you know, we should celebrate that he was here. The fact that he was here really helped the world. ""So I want people to remember that and not when he passed away. But of course he did pass away, and I don't know, but by saying that I think -- concentrating on his birthday -- I think somehow I changed the kind of configuration of things,"" Ono said. Ono continues to live in the Manhattan apartment building, the Dakota, where the couple and their son, Sean, lived. It was outside that building where Chapman gunned down Lennon after Lennon had earlier given him an autograph. Ono marked Lennon's birthday by visiting her memorial to him: the Imagine Peace Tower in Iceland, a tower made of light, which she visits every year. She selected the Atlantic island country ""because Iceland is the top north in the map. And north is wisdom and power, and the wisdom and power from the north would just go spread all over the world,"" she said. Now 77, Ono has been remastering Lennon's music, and she performed with her Plastic Ono Band during Iceland's memorial celebration. She recalled how she first learned of Lennon's death -- in the hospital where he was taken for his bullet wounds. It's a time she doesn't care to ponder. ""When I went to the hospital and I was waiting and the doctor came and he was carrying something of John's, like, his ring, and that's when I thought, ah, what is it, what is it? Just funny feeling about it, and when he said that he passed away, I said no, he didn't, he's alive, You know, very, very upset about it. I just refused to think that he died."" Whenever Lennon's murderer is up for parole, Ono speaks out against his release. ""I'm very concerned about that because, you know, he's not a very stable person,"" she said. She's skeptical of any portrayal of Chapman as a ""very, very agreeable"" person. ""So now that he's very charming or something, well, he was perfectly charming then too. So I don't really have a trust for him -- for what would happen when he comes out,"" she said. Chapman killed Lennon on December 8, 1980. At the time, Lennon was 40; Chapman, 25. ""Well he got the autograph from John that very day,"" Ono said. ""You know, we were going to go to the studio, and John was a very, very astute person in that sense. To go to studio right (on) time. Not an hour later or two hours later. Most musicians didn't really care, but he was very prompt about those things. So we had the car, I got in the car, and I saw that John was still signing autographs. ""I said, 'John, we have to go now,' and he said, 'Yeah, OK, Yoko,' "" she added. Forgiveness for the murder remains a difficult matter, she said. ""Well, I don't really know, I have to think about that,"" Ono said. ""But Sean especially and me too (are) still living a very strong situation. It didn't suddenly go away. ... So it's a very difficult situation and we can't get out of it."" Part of Beatles lore is that Strawberry Fields was actually an orphanage near Lennon's childhood home, and whenever Lennon acted like a bad boy, his mother and aunt threatened to send him there, Ono said. ""He was having a love-hate relationship with Strawberry Field. It was a very big thing in his life,"" Ono said. ""So then he made a song out of it. See, by having a very painful memory and changing that into a song, and then that was changed to here, into a park."" Over the years, Ono has been characterized by some as the overbearing wife who caused the breakup of one of the most famous bands of the 20th century. Born in Japan, she blames racism as well as sexism for the unfounded charge, she said. The Beatles had long been having internal problems, she said. ""I think I was used as a scapegoat, and it's a very easy scapegoat, a Japanese woman and whatever,"" Ono said. ""Sexism, racism, but also just remember that the United States and Britain were fighting with Japan in World War II."" While she was stung by such characterizations, she and Lennon went on to enjoy a full marriage. Asked if the finger-pointing hurt her, Ono responded, ""Well, it did in a way. But you know, it was sort of like a distant thing in a way, because John and I were so close. And we were just totally involved in each other and in our work. ""You know,"" she added, ""I just kept on being -- getting ideas. And he was, too. So that was much more exciting."" Watch Anderson Cooper 360° weeknights 10pm ET.

"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- In the aftermath of 9/11, Americans were angry, fearful and scrambling for answers. In the days that followed the terrorist attacks, President George W. Bush and Congress prepared their response, starting to work on stronger counterterrorism measures and preparing for a war in Afghanistan, where the Taliban had housed al Qaeda networks for many years. A few Americans turned their rage against Muslims who were living in the United States. Within a few days, Muslims, as well as individuals mistakenly perceived to be Muslims, were attacked. The Sikh owner of a gas station in Mesa, Arizona, was killed by a man who went on to shoot a Lebanese clerk at another gas station. Near Dallas, Texas, a man shot and killed a 46-year old Pakistani who owned a small grocery store. In Cleveland, Ohio, a man drove a Ford Mustang right through an Islamic center. Nine years after 9/11, there is a lot for Americans to contemplate as they look back. Although people have focused a lot of attention on Bush's appearance before a group of New York firefighters at ground zero, another highly significant moment took place on September 17. That day, at the Islamic Center in Washington, the president delivered a powerful message about the need to keep America's response to 9/11 from turning into a war against Muslims. This message was as important to his war on terrorism as the strategy of regime change, or pre-emptive war. Unfortunately, this is a principle that has been slowly and dangerously undermined in recent weeks as a result of the controversy over a proposed Islamic cultural center and mosque a few blocks from ground zero. Speaking at an emotionally charged moment, just six days after the attacks, Bush told the audience that it was vital for Americans to understand that the terrorists did not represent the Muslim tradition. ""Those who feel like they can intimidate our fellow citizens to take out their anger don't represent the best of America; they represent the worst of humankind, and they should be ashamed of that kind of behavior,"" Bush said. The president reiterated his firm commitment to protecting the constitutional rights and honoring the important role of the Muslim community in the United States. In no uncertain terms, Bush said: ""The face of terror is not the true faith of Islam. That's not what Islam is all about. Islam is peace. These terrorists don't represent peace. They represent evil and war."" America, he said, ""counts millions of Muslims amongst our citizens, and Muslims make an incredibly valuable contribution to our country. Muslims are doctors, lawyers, law professors, members of the military, entrepreneurs, shopkeepers, moms and dads."" Many Muslim leaders were impressed by the president's speech as well as by how most Americans were responding to the trauma. ""Americans have shown great maturity,"" Sayyid Syeed, the secretary general of the Islamic Society of North America, told the media. He reported the calls he was receiving expressing support for his community greatly outweighed the hate crimes. Over the coming years, Bush stuck with the argument that he made on September 17. While Bush would come under criticism for many aspects of his war on terrorism -- including policies such as the use of interrogation tactics that critics called torture -- he continued to be very clear in his defense of Muslims. The president returned to the Islamic Center on June 2007, reminding his audience of his earlier speech: ""We gather, with friendship and respect, to reaffirm that pledge -- and to renew our determination to stand together in the pursuit of freedom and peace. We come to express our appreciation for a faith that has enriched civilization for centuries."" Bush's philosophy is now under fire. In response to the proposal to build an Islamic center near ground zero in New York City, a heated national debate has unfolded about Muslims in America. While some focused their criticism on whether this was a proper project so close to the site of the attacks, many others turned it into a different kind of discussion. Some national Republican leaders, including Sarah Palin and Newt Gingrich, have made provocative comments, helping to make it a national issue. Gingrich warned of the ""radical Islamists"" he said were behind the project, comparing it to Nazis putting up a sign next to the Holocaust Museum in Washington. At the local level, the debate has taken an even more dangerous turn. A Florida pastor, Terry Jones, announced he would burn copies of the Quran. Even when he came under criticism from a broad spectrum of leaders, including Gen. David Petraeus, he did not at first desist. Rather than listening, he said, ""Maybe it's time to send a message to radical Islam that we will not tolerate their behavior."" Palin did condemn the pastor by tweeting that ""book burning is antithetical to American ideals,"" but then tied the two issues together when she went on to say that ""people have a constitutional right to burn a Koran if they want to, but doing so is insensitive and an unnecessary provocation -- much like building a mosque at ground zero."" Although the pastor agreed to cancel the Quran burning after a call from Secretary of Defense Robert Gates warning it would put American lives at risk, the incident stoked the fires of hatred. If this kind of inflammatory rhetoric continues, it will erode a central and crucial principle in the war on terrorism. It also contradicts the nation's constitutional and pluralistic traditions -- the very traditions we want to defend from terrorism -- while doing irreparable harm abroad. When Bush spoke at the Islamic Center, he took a pivotal step in defining how he wanted to defend the nation and go about punishing the aggressors who killed thousands of civilians. His message cannot be forgotten. Should local and national debate move in a different direction, we will be paying the cost as a nation for decades to come by destroying our image in the Muslim world, thus playing into the hands of the terrorists. We'd be abandoning the very best ideals that our country has to offer. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian E. Zelizer.","After 9/11, a few Americans lashed out at innocent Muslims .

"(CNN) -- The European Commission is looking into France's expulsion of more than 8,000 ethnic Roma, commonly referred to as gypsies, the commission's president told CNN Tuesday. ""The European Commission, working with the French authorities, is now making an independent assessment"" of the situation, Jose Manuel Barroso said on CNN's ""Quest Means Business."" Recent raids against camps in Lyon, France, and other cities forced out a total of 8,300 Romanian and Bulgarian nationals of Roma origin. Close to 10,000 were expelled in 2009. Barroso said in his first state of the union speech on Tuesday that governments ""must respect human rights."" That wasn't specifically aimed at France, he told CNN, though he noted that France is in the middle of a ""very politicized debate."" ""I do not want to interfere in that debate,"" he said, but he added that the commission is investigating how France is implementing European law. The European Commission is the executive arm of the European Union. ""In Europe there is no room for discrimination,"" Barroso said. ""That's why we are going to make these independent assessments with the French authorities and with the other countries, because, in fact, the Roma issue is a general problem. ""We have to be sure that the European directives are properly transposed and implemented in all the European member states,"" he said. Roma are a group of people who live mainly in southern and eastern Europe, often in poverty. They tend to live in camps, caravans, or informal settlements and have been the target of persecution throughout history. The expulsions from France followed proposals from President Nicolas Sarkozy officially aimed at fighting crime. The proposals include stripping French citizenship from immigrants convicted of certain crimes. Immigration policy has long been a top issue for the conservative Sarkozy. As interior minister, he advocated the deportation of foreign nationals caught in violent riots across France in 2005. But the recent crackdowns have spawned criticism even within Sarkozy's government. Local media reported that Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said he was shocked by the president's anti-crime proposals. Last month's ousting of Roma gypsies without valid identity papers drew international criticism, with some comparing it to the deportation of Jews during World War II. The government called the comparison absurd since those being expelled were being sent back to their homelands with financial compensation of 300 euros ($381) per adult and 100 euros ($127) per child, according to France's immigration ministry. French officials have said the deportations are part of a broader crackdown on illegal immigration. CNN's Jim Bittermann and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","The European Commission is investigating France's action, its head says .

"LONDON, England -- Dubai will stage the world's richest golf tournament as part of the European Tour's 2009 schedule. Lofty ambition: The world's richest golf event was launched at the world's tallest hotel in Dubai. The Dubai World Championship, to be held at Jumeirah Golf Estates on November 19-22 of that year, will have a prize pool of $10 million -- with $1,666,660 on offer for the winner. The Tour's Order of Merit will be renamed The Race to Dubai with a prize pool also of $10 million, and is expected to start in January from 2010 instead of late November on the current calendar. The top-ranked player will receive $2 million, the runner-up $1.5 million and the third-placed player $1 million, with prizes down to the 15th player, who will earn $250,000. European Tour chief executive George O'Grady said: ""This is so much more than a tournament sponsorship. It is a long-term partnership which will see the European Tour and Dubai joining together to significantly enhance the game worldwide and take golf to a new level for spectators everywhere."" The first five years of the Tour's new partnership with Leisurecorp, the company developing Dubai's leading residential golf community, will also see the building of a new international headquarters for the governing body and the creation of a global property company to develop new tournament venues around the world. The inaugural event will run on either the Fire or Earth course, both of which were designed by former world No. 1 Greg Norman. The Jumeirah complex also includes a Water course designed by Vijay Singh and a Wind course carrying the names of Norman, Sergio Garcia and American designer Pete Dye. The agreement signed between Leisurecorp and the European Tour includes an option to extend for a further five years. O'Grady added: ""The scale of this agreement is testament to the vision of Dubai and its ruler His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, who has recognized the dynamic role golf can play in developing the global profile of this amazing city. ""It is also testament to Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem (chairman of Leisurecorp's parent company Dubai World), who has been instrumental in turning that vision into reality. ""The Race to Dubai will bring a new dimension to the European Tour, creating great drama and theatre throughout the year as all the best players in the world are given the opportunity to compete in the world's richest tournament. ""Moreover, as the European Tour has become ever-more global in its outlook, it has become increasingly important to us to have an international base in a strategically-placed location. ""Dubai is a massively important and growing hub, with outstanding air links to all our locations, and the perfect place for us to offer a tailor-made service to all our members through the Center of Excellence at the European Tour International Headquarters."" As with the current season-ending Volvo Masters at Valderrama in Spain, the Dubai World Championship will be restricted to the leading 60 players on the European money list. The money on offer exceeds what is currently on offer at the four major tournaments. The British Open is the richest of those at the moment at $8.6 million, with the Masters, U.S. Open and U.S. PGA all just under $7 million this year. The U.S. Tour's Players Championship is the richest single event, offering a purse of almost $9 million.

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Former Cuban President Fidel Castro said Friday that he was misinterpreted when he recently told an American journalist that the Cuban model no longer works. In a speech at the University of Havana that was then broadcast on Cuban TV, Castro said he meant ""exactly the opposite"" of what was understood by Jeffrey Goldberg, who was interviewing him for The Atlantic. According to Goldberg, when he asked Castro during an interview last week if the Cuban model could be exported, the 84-year-old former leader answered: ""The Cuban model doesn't even work for us anymore."" The comment was widely interpreted as Castro's admission that the Soviet-style economic model he introduced after his revolution no longer works. Goldberg wrote on The Atlantic's blog that he turned to Julia Sweig of the Council on Foreign Affairs, who was present at the interview, ""to interpret this stunning statement for me."" ""She said, 'He wasn't rejecting the ideas of the revolution. I took it to be an acknowledgment that under ""the Cuban model"" the state has much too big a role in the economic life of the country,'"" he wrote. On Friday, Castro said he was correctly quoted, but that, ""in reality, my answer meant exactly the opposite of what both American journalists interpreted regarding the Cuban model."" ""My idea, as the whole world knows, is that the capitalist system no longer works for the United States or the world,"" he said. ""How could such a system work for a socialist country like Cuba?"" Castro called Goldberg ""a great journalist."" ""He does not invent phrases, he transfers them and interprets them,"" he said. ""I await with interest his extensive article."" He told an audience that included some of his former soldiers who were there to mark the publication of his 608-page autobiography that the capitalist system ""leads from crisis to crisis, each one more serious.""","The former Cuban leader said, ""The Cuban model doesn't even work for us anymore.""

"(CNN)  -- England wicketkeeper Matt Prior will miss the crucial fourth Test against West Indies in Barbados on Thursday after his wife gave birth to their first child, a baby boy. England cricketer Prior dashed from the Caribbean to be with wife Emily following the birth of their first child. Prior rushed home from the Caribbean to be with his wife Emily after hearing the news in the early hours of Monday morning. The Sussex star was due to temporarily quit the tour on March 2, the due date for the birth, but his premature departure will give reserve wicketkeeper Tim Ambrose the chance to impress. Prior regained his England place from Ambrose after an impressive season with the bat and gloves for his county side Sussex last season. England are 1-0 down in the series after losing the first Test and then failing to secure victory in the third Test in Antigua as West Indies battled to a draw. They are already without injured all-rounder Andrew Flintoff, who has a hip injury and there were doubts over off-spinner Graeme Swann, who has an elbow problem. Meanwhile, respected West Indian umpire Steve Bucknor has announced he will quit officiating in international matches next month. The 62-year-old Jamaican will stand in the third Test between South Africa and Australia starting on March 19 in Cape Town and his last match will be a one-day international between the West Indies and England at Barbados on March 29. Bucknor has umpired 126 Test matches since 1989. In cricket action on Monday, Pakistan captain Younis Khan scored a century as his side reached 296 for three wickets against Sri Lanka on the third day of the first Test in Karachi. Khan was unbeaten on 149 at stumps as his team replied to Sri Lanka's massive 644 for seven declared. Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene and Thilan Samaraweera both hit  double centuries as they notched up a Test record fourth wicket partnership of 437 in their innings.","England wicketkeeper Matt Prior returns home early from West Indies tour .

"Chicago, Illinois (CNN) -- Former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich was found guilty Tuesday of making false statements to the FBI, but escaped convictions on 23 other counts in a trial that is seen as at least a partial victory for Blagojevich. The jury, which deliberated for 14 days, said it was hung on 23 counts against him and on the counts against the former governor's brother, Robert Blagojevich. The former governor faced charges including racketeering, wire fraud, attempted extortion and bribery. A two-term Democrat, he was removed from office in January 2009 amid accusations that he attempted to sell the U.S. Senate seat that had been occupied by Barack Obama before Obama was elected president. ""On every charge except for one, they could not prove that I did anything wrong,"" said Rod Blagojevich, shorty after the jury was dismissed. ""I told the truth from the very beginning."" He added he would appeal the one conviction and thanked members of the jury for finding what they did. The next court date in the case is set for August 26, though prosecutors said they will try the former governor again. The maximum penalty for making false statements is five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Conviction on the counts of wire fraud, racketeering and attempted extortion would have carried a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000, while a conviction on the count of solicitation of bribery would have had a maximum sentence of 10 years and a fine of up to $250,000. Blagojevich's brother, Robert, stood trial with him on four of the charges. Robert Blagojevich testified that his brother was ""trying to politically work something to his benefit"" in handling the Senate appointment but was thinking in terms of political horse-trading, not corruption. In one conversation recorded by federal agents, the former governor told an aide, ""I've got this thing, and it's [expletive] golden. I'm just not giving it up for [expletive] nothing."" ""It didn't seem out of the ordinary, because Obama was taking a lot of people from Illinois with him to D.C.,"" said Robert Blagojevich, who raised money for his brother. He said the governor ""was interested in the idea of being the head of Health and Human Services."" While awaiting trial, the ousted governor repeatedly asserted his innocence in interviews and on Twitter, as well as during his appearances on the ""Celebrity Apprentice"" reality show. ""Unfortunately, the pain and embarrassment that this whole situation has caused our great state will not come to a complete close today,"" said U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., D-Illinois, who was cited in the criminal complaint against Blagojevich.

The pair was accused of having an illicit sexual relationship, a spokesman for the Kunduz governor said. The woman was about 20 years old and the man was about 27, said Mohammed Ayuob, district governor of Amam Sahib, which is also in Kunduz province.

"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- What was Hurricane Karl was losing its punch in Mexico Friday, while Category 2 Hurricane Igor turned toward Bermuda, which is bracing for landfall late Sunday. A third hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean, Julia, continued to sputter, forecasters said. Karl's eye came ashore just north of the city of Veracruz, Mexico, around 11:30 a.m. (12:30 p.m. ET) Friday. Karl was gradually downgraded to a tropical storm, with 70 mph (115 kph) winds at 8 p.m. ET, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. The storm's biggest threat may come from torrential rainfall. Some areas may receive between 5 to 10 inches, with isolated amounts of 15 inches possible. At least 3,000 homes in central Mexico were damaged when Karl came ashore, the state-run Notimex news agency reported. The Hurricane Center said the storm is expected to weaken to a tropical depression soon and dissipate over the mountains of Mexico on Sunday. Some local flooding was reported, the Mexican Interior Ministry said. The Mexican government canceled all coastal warnings and watches. Meanwhile, the two other hurricanes in the tropical trio churned in the open Atlantic Ocean. A storm system south of the Cape Verde Islands has a 10 percent chance of becoming a tropical cyclone, forecasters said. At 8 p.m. (7 p.m. ET), Hurricane Igor, downgraded to Category 2, had maximum sustained winds near 105 mph (165 kph). It was moving toward the northwest at 10 mph (17 kph), but forecasters said its forward speed and strength are expected to increase in the next couple of days, followed by gradual weakening. Igor was about 600 miles (965 kilometers) south-southeast of Bermuda. A hurricane warning was in effect for the island, which was already feeling effects from the storm, the Hurricane Center said. The United Kingdom's Foreign and Commonwealth Office called Igor a ""dangerous"" storm and said Bermudan authorities are making appropriate plans for its arrival late Sunday or early Monday. British nationals are getting updated travel advice. Home Affairs Minister David Burch warned island residents to be ready for storm surge and high winds. ""It is my sincere hope that you and your families take the remainder of today to finalize your hurricane preparations, by securing your homes, your property and ensuring that you have adequate supplies,"" he said. Officials expect to close the main airport Saturday. A British frigate will be stationed offshore, ready to offer any assistance. Large swells generated by Igor will continue to affect the Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, the Bahamas and the Virgin Islands, according to the weather agency. These swells are expected to cause dangerous surf- and rip-current conditions in Bermuda over the next several days. The swells will reach the eastern coast of the United States, including Florida, on Friday and continue through the weekend, possibly causing rip currents. In the far eastern Atlantic, Category 1 Hurricane Julia continued to weaken. As of 5 p.m. (4 p.m. ET), Julia's maximum sustained winds were 75 mph (120 kph). The storm was moving west-northwest at about 18 mph (30 kph). The storm's center was about 1,525 miles (2,450 kilometers) southwest of the Azores Islands.","NEW: Karl is downgraded to a tropical storm .

"(CNN) -- Police in a Chicago, Illinois, suburb Wednesday were investigating a pipe-bomb explosion that decapitated a man. The body of Colin Dalebroux, 21, was found near a middle school close to his apartment in Evanston, Illinois, on Tuesday, CNN affiliates reported, citing local police. WGN-TV reported that a man walking his dog in a park found the body when his pet tugged at his leash. The man, Dale Wyatt, and another pedestrian saw the body and called police. ""Honestly, at first I thought it was a mannequin, like somebody was playing a sick prank,"" Wyatt said. Wyatt said the body ""was laying, his legs were underneath his body like he was laying down. His right arm was up and then everything from the neck up was completely gone."" Police on Tuesday said an explosion was heard in the area about 3:53 a.m. and residents thought it was a blown transmitter. Police responded but couldn't identify the source of the sound. Nearly two hours later, police were called again when the man's body was discovered. Police arriving on the scene saw what they thought was an ""operable explosive device"" and called the Cook County Bomb Squad. Officers immediately established a safety perimeter and went door-to-door to notify residents. The device was safely rendered inoperable, authorities said. Police believe the victim had two explosive devices, thought to be pipe bombs: the one that was dismantled and ""one of which detonated ending his own life."" Police searched the area and went to what was thought to be the victim's residence. ""While at this location, Evanston Police determined that no immediate public safety risk existed,"" police said Tuesday. Investigators were working with the FBI to examine the man's computer. The school, Nichols Middle School, is closed for the second day in a row because of the blast and the probe into the incident.","The incident occurred in Evanston .

"(CNN) -- Years before the first Gulf War, Saddam Hussein was slaughtering Iraq's Kurds with bombs, bullets and gas. Kurdish refugees fleeing Saddam Hussein's chemical weapons attacks in 1988. The Reagan White House saw it as a ruthless attempt to put down a rebellion by a minority ethnic group fighting for independence and allied with Iraq's enemy, Iran. But Peter Galbraith thought it was something worse. ""A light went off in my head, and I said, 'Saddam Hussein is committing genocide,'"" said Galbraith, who was on the staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at the time. An unabashed idealist, Galbraith was known for tackling unconventional issues. ""If you're going to be idealistic in life, you're going to be disappointed,"" he said. ""But that's not a reason to abandon idealism."" Galbraith was one of the first Westerners to witness the effects of the slaughter. During a fact-finding trip for the Senate in 1987, he saw something troubling. ""When we crossed from the Arab part of Iraq into the Kurdish part of Iraq, the villages and towns that showed on our maps just weren't there,"" he said. Bulldozing Kurdish villages was just the first phase of Hussein's war against the Kurds. In 1988, it escalated with chemical weapons. ""Thousands, maybe tens of thousands of people were killed in those attacks, and then Iraqi troops moved into those villages and gunned down the survivors."" Galbraith wanted to invoke the U.N.'s Genocide Convention, which requires countries to prevent and punish such crimes. ""We could not stand aside and allow Saddam Hussein to commit genocide against the Kurds of Iraq."" With the support of his boss, Democratic Sen. Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, Galbraith drafted a bill -- the Prevention of Genocide Act -- that would cut off U.S. foreign aid to Iraq and impose a trade embargo. ""That would have been an appropriate response to a dictator who is gassing his own people,"" Galbraith said. ""I thought with a name like that it would garner a lot of support."" But the compelling name was not enough. So Galbraith went back to the region to gather more evidence.  Watch as Galbraith describes his fight to end the slaughter » . Tens of thousands of Kurds had fled to Turkey. Survivors described blinding, burning clouds of poison gas that dropped people in their tracks. ""These people don't make up these stories. These are real stories. And if you talk to them, if you simply talk to them ... you know that they're telling the truth,"" Galbraith said. His report was still not enough to persuade the White House to punish Saddam.  Watch as Galbraith discusses genocide » . The Reagan administration had invested several years cultivating Iraq as an ally against Iran, their mutual enemy, and as a market for U.S. products, including more than $1 billion a year in farm exports. The Prevention of Genocide Act would end the diplomatic courtship and hurt U.S businesses. Read once-secret documents from the Reagan administration . ""I had a fellow who worked for one of the Louisiana senators call me up really in tears,"" Galbraith said. ""And when I talked about genocide against the Kurds, he talked about the genocide that I was committing against the rice farmers of Louisiana."" Although then-Secretary of State George Schultz warned Iraq that use of outlawed chemical weapons jeopardized the two countries' budding relationship, Schultz's spokesman said imposing economic sanctions would be premature.  Watch as George Schultz explains the administration's position » . To Galbraith, ""that was a morally repugnant statement."" The Reagan administration also claimed Galbraith's bill used ""inaccurate terms like genocide."" But for Galbraith, this was no time for semantics. ""Should we have waited until he used chemical weapons again? Should we have waited until instead of 5 percent of the Kurdish population was murdered -- 10? 15?"" In the end, the House of Representatives killed Galbraith's sanctions bill with backing from the Reagan administration. Politics had trumped principle. Galbraith calls the U.S. policy ""appeasement."" ""We were not able to modify Iraq's behavior,"" Galbraith said. ""And guess what?"" Two years later, in August 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait, its oil-rich neighbor to the south. This time, the U.S. compared Saddam to Hitler. And with Kuwait's oil at stake, the U.S finally screamed bloody murder.","Years before the first Gulf War, Saddam Hussein was slaughtering Iraq's Kurds .

"(CNN) -- A man in Kentucky shot and killed five people before turning the gun on himself after a domestic dispute on Saturday, Breathitt County Sheriff Ray Clemons told CNN. The gunman was identified as 47-year-old Stanley Neace, said Trooper Jody Sims of the Kentucky State Police, which took over the investigation. Clemons said Neace's wife and stepson are among the dead. The shooting happened around midday at a mobile home community of about a dozen trailers, Clemons said. He declined to give the victims' ages and names. Officers heard a gunshot as they arrived on scene and later found a 12-gauge shotgun, Sims said. The suspected gunman was found dead on the front porch of his house, while the victims were found in two separate residences, he added. Sims declined to provide details on the victims. ""We are in the process of getting the names of these five victims and making final family notifications,"" he said. Neighbor Martha Jackson told CNN affiliate WLEX that Neace ran up to her and asked to use her phone. ""I said, 'Do you want me to call 911 for you?' and he said, 'yes,' and told the police ... 'Stanley Neace was shooting, running in people's homes, killing 'em,'"" Jackson said. Jackson said Neace was told not to go back, but Neace said, ""I've got to go, my wife is there.""

"(CNN) -- George Steinbrenner was a ""cracker who made a lot of African-American millionaires,"" conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh said Tuesday of the New York Yankees owner who died earlier in the day from a heart attack. ""He fired a bunch of white guys as managers left and right,"" Limbaugh said. The comments prompted civil rights activist Rev. Al Sharpton to rebuke the radio talker, calling his comments ""repugnant and offensive whether they were intended to be facetious or tongue and cheek."" ""For the last 20 years I have known George Steinbrenner, and we have quarrelled over diversity and community programs, but I always found him fair, direct, and genuinely prone to do what he felt was right,"" Sharpton said, adding that Limbaugh owed the Steinbrenner family an apology ""that the first day of their mourning to have to be subjected to this type of rhetoric."" Premiere Radio Networks, which broadcast Limbaugh's show, has not responded to requests for comment. It's not the first time Limbaugh, sports and race have caused a stir. He resigned from ESPN in 2003 after saying on air that ""the media has been very desirous that a black quarterback do well."" ""They're interested in black coaches and black quarterbacks doing well,"" he said during a discussion of Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb. ""I think there's a little hope invested in McNabb, and he got a lot of credit for the performance of his team that he really didn't deserve."" That comment came back to haunt him last year when he joined a consortium that sought to buy the St. Louis Rams. He was ultimately dropped from the group after a firestorm of criticism swarmed around his presence. Limbaugh has frequently lambasted celebratory dances performed by National Football League players after scoring touchdowns (""a cultural problem ... that has resulted in a total lack of class"") and assailed the game itself for its aggressive nature. ""Look, let me put it to you this way: the NFL all too often looks like a game between the Bloods and the Crips without any weapons. There, I said it,"" he said in 2007.

"(CNN) -- South Africa's ""Blade Runner"" Oscar Pistorius is still struggling to qualify for the Commonwealth Games despite smashing his own Paralympic record in Britain on Saturday. The 23-year-old, a double-amputee, triumphed at the 400 meters T44 event at London's Crystal Palace, setting a new leading time of 47.03 seconds. Pistorius, who won the right to compete against able-bodied athletes in 2008, was a clear winner in the Paralympics-ratified race as he finished 4.61 seconds ahead of British runner-up Ian Jones. However, with South Africa due to name its team for the October 3-14 Games in Delhi later this month, time is running out for him to attain the qualifying standard of 45.95. Pistorius did not qualify for the 2008 Olympics but set his previous world 400m record of 47.49 in winning gold at the Paralympics in Beijing. He ran in a 400m B race in London on Friday night, but the damp conditions were unsuited to his carbon-fiber prosthetic limbs and he finished outside of the qualifying time with 46.93 as he placed seventh. Meanwhile, American runner Jeremy Wariner clinched his fifth consecutive Diamond League victory this season when he won the 400m in London on Saturday. The triple Olympic gold medal winner came home in 44.67 to head off Jamaicans Jermaine Gonzales (44.80) and Ricardo Chambers (45.18). His compatriot Allyson Felix followed up her 200m win on Friday by claiming a double as she triumphed in the 400m from Russia's European champion Tatyna Firova and fellow U.S. runner Debbie Dunn. Marshevet Myers won the women's 100m from fellow American Carmelita Jeter, and their compatriot Wallace Spearmon won the men's event.

"(CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has condemned the planned burning of Qurans on the anniversary of the 2001 attacks on the United States as criticism mounts from Muslims around the world. Speaking Tuesday at an iftar meal in Washington to celebrate the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, Clinton said she welcomed the concerns. ""I am heartened by the clear, unequivocal condemnation of this disrespectful, disgraceful act that has come from American religious leaders of all faiths ... as well as secular U.S. leaders and opinion makers,"" she said. On Wednesday the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan also condemned the Florida church's plan to burn the Quran, the Muslim holy book, as ""disrespectful, intolerant and divisive,"" in a statement. The statement comes days after the top U.S. military commander in Afghanistan, Gen. David Petraeus, warned that the plan could put U.S. troops' lives at risk. The pastor of the church, Terry Jones, told CNN Tuesday his flock was taking the warning seriously but had not decided to cancel the event, planned for September 11. Jones, pastor of Dove World Outreach Center in Gainesville, Florida, told CNN's ""American Morning:""We have firmly made up our mind, but at the same time, we are definitely praying about it."" Later Tuesday, Jones had a response to the statement from Petraeus. ""The general needs to point his finger to radical Islam and tell them to shut up, tell them to stop, tell them that we will not bow our knees to them,"" Jones said on CNN's ""AC360."" ""We are burning the book,"" Jones said. ""We are not killing someone. We are not murdering people."" The planned action has drawn sharp criticism from Muslims around the world and from U.S. officials. The U.S. Embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan, on Tuesday issued a statement saying the U.S. government ""in no way condones such acts of disrespect against the religion of Islam, and is deeply concerned about deliberate attempts to offend members of religious or ethnic groups."" It emphasized that it strongly condemned ""the offensive messages, which are contrary to U.S. government policy and deeply offensive to Muslims especially during the month of Ramadan."" With about 120,000 U.S. and NATO-led troops still battling al Qaeda and its allies in the Islamic fundamentalist Taliban movement, Petraeus warned that burning Qurans ""is precisely the kind of action the Taliban uses and could cause significant problems -- not just here, but everywhere in the world we are engaged with the Islamic community."" Petraeus said he was concerned about the political repercussions of the church's plan. ""Even the rumor that it might take place has sparked demonstrations such as the one that took place in Kabul yesterday,"" he said. ""Were the actual burning to take place, the safety of our soldiers and civilians would be put in jeopardy and accomplishment of the mission would be made more difficult."" Thousands of Indonesians gathered outside the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia, on Sunday to protest the planned Quran burning. ""The burning is not only an insult to the holy Quran, but an insult to Islam and Muslims around the world,"" said Muhammad Ismail, a spokesman for the hard-line Indonesian Muslim group Hizb ut-Tahrir. Jones said his congregation was aware that the action was offensive. ""We realize that this action would indeed offend people, offend the Muslims. I am offended when they burn the flag. I am offended when they burn the Bible. But we feel that the message that we are trying to send is much more important than people being offended."" Jones said Muslims are welcomed in the United States, if they observe the Constitution and don't try to impose Sharia law, or Muslim law. The message, he said, is directed toward the ""radical element of Islam."" ""Our message is very clear,"" he said. ""It is not to the moderate Muslim. Our message is not a message of hate. Our message is a message of warning to the radical element of Islam, and I think what we see right now around the globe provides exactly what we're talking about,"" he said. The center says it was founded in 1986 as a ""total concept church for the rich, the poor, the young and the old."" Its purpose is to ""stand up for righteousness and for the truth of the Bible."" It stresses that ""Christians must return to the truth and stop hiding."" ""We need to speak up against sin and call the people to repentance. Abortion is murder. Homosexuality is sin. We need to call these things what they are and bring the world the true message: that Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life,"" it says on the church's website. It also emphasizes its dislike of Islam, and on its website, it blog posts an item called ""Ten Reasons to Burn a Koran. ""Any religion which would profess anything other than this truth is of the devil. This is why we also take a stand against Islam, which teaches that Jesus is not the Son of God, therefore taking away the saving power of Jesus Christ and leading people straight to Hell,"" the site says.

"Washington (CNN) -- The first living Medal of Honor recipient since the Vietnam War says his receiving the prestigious award is bittersweet. ""All of this is great,"" U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Salvatore Giunta said during a teleconference Wednesday. ""But it does bring back a lot of memories of people that I would love to share this moment with. And I am just not going to have this opportunity because they are no longer with us."" Giunta said the day his unit came under attack was quiet and started out like any other day in Afghanistan. ""We are all soldiers and we are all out on a mission,"" he said. Giunta, 25, was a specialist serving with the Airborne 503 Infantry Regiment on his second tour of duty in Afghanistan when his unit was attacked on the night of October 25, 2007. He recalls himself as an average soldier, saying he didn't do anything that someone else wouldn't have done. According to Defense Department documents seen by CNN, Giunta and his fellow soldiers were walking back to base along the top of a mountain ridge when the enemy attacked from their front and their left. Taliban fighters barraged the Americans with AK-47s, rocket propelled grenades and Soviet era large machine guns. Giunta saw several of his fellow soldiers go down. He ran forward throwing grenades and returning enemy fire to help one soldier who had been shot but was still fighting. Then he noticed one of the wounded soldiers was missing. He ran over a hill where moments before Taliban fighters were shooting at him to find his wounded friend, Sgt. Josh Brennan. But now he was alone, out of sight of his fellow soldiers, in an area that the Taliban had controlled just moments before. Giunta saw two Taliban fighters dragging Brennan away. He ran after them, killing one Taliban and wounding the other, who ran away. He instantly started providing first aid to Brennan, who had been shot at least six times. Brennan was later evacuated by a helicopter to a hospital, but he died of his wounds. Giunta himself was shot twice in the incident, with one round hitting his body armor and the second destroying a weapon slung over his back. He was not seriously hurt. His quick response to the Taliban attack helped his unit repulse the enemy fighters before they could cause more casualties, the Defense Department documents note. Giunta said his actions were not something he thought about but something he was trained to do. ""After the medevac bird comes in and starts picking people up, it's not over, you're not out of Afghanistan, you're not off the side of the mountain, you're just minus some buddies and there's no time to talk, you still have to complete the mission,"" he said. Giunta's wife, Jenny, sat beside him during the teleconference from the base Giunta is stationed at in Vicenza, Italy. She said she is proud of her husband. The two married last November and are unsure about what the future will bring. Jenny Giunta said she hopes her husband does not deploy again. ""Having your husband ... your loved one get deployed and knowing that they're going to be somewhere that's dangerous .... It's an awful feeling,"" she said.","NEW: Staff Sgt.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Embassy in Jordan warned Wednesday that ""credible information"" has been received about a possible imminent threat in the region of the Gulf of Aqaba, the branch of the Red Sea that lies between Egypt, Israel, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. The embassy warned U.S. citizens to avoid the downtown and port areas of the city of Aqaba, a tourist destination that lies on the Red Sea near the border with Israel. It recommended that all non-official and personal travel to Aqaba be deferred for at least 48 hours. The embassy issued a similar warning last month, after two rockets hit a street near the Intercontinental Hotel in Aqaba on August 2. News reports said a Jordanian civilian was killed. Rockets were also fired the same day at the Israeli Red Sea resort city of Eilat, according to news reports. However, Ali Al Ayed, Jordan's minister for media affairs and communications, told the state news agency Petra that the security situation was assessed and is considered stable. He said the U.S. Embassy warnings pertained only to U.S. citizens.","The embassy says it has ""credible information"" about a possible threat .

"(CNN) -- In an audio message released Sunday, a speaker identified as al Qaeda's second-in-command offers condolences to the Turkish people on the loss of nine activists in a May 31 Israeli raid on an aid flotilla headed for Gaza. The incident badly frayed Israel's once-close relationship with Turkey. The speaker, who was identified as Ayman al-Zawahiri, said in the message the incident underscores the need for Turkey to stop cooperating with or recognizing Israel. ""Change will come when the Turkish people demand that their government ceases all aspects of cooperation with Israel and stop recognizing Israel and when they ask their government to stop sending their (Turkish) armed forces to fight the Muslims in Afghanistan and end their battle against Islam and the Sharia,"" al-Zawahiri said. The message is identified as being a production of As-Sahab production, a company typically handles al Qaeda communications. Although CNN cannot independently authenticate the audio message, it appeared on various radical Islamist websites known for posting similiar statements, messsages and recruitment videos by al Qaeda figures. In the message, titled ""A Message to the Turkish Muslim people,"" the speaker said the blockade of Gaza by Israel ""is another form of the criminal acts waged against the Muslim world by the Crusader Zionist alliance."" ""We must change this disgusting reality that we live in,"" he said. ""This will not take place by sending (a) few relief aid ships or starting one demonstration or another."" ""The Turkish people need to restore the glorious role of the Ottoman Empire when they used to defend every Muslim land from all outsiders,"" he said. ""The role of the Turkish Muslim people cannot be minimized into an aid ship or two that are being sent to Gaza."" Israel has maintained its troops used force on the activists after they were attacked by those on board one boat in the flotilla, the Mavi Marmara. Soldiers were attacked with knives, metal poles and other objects, Israeli officials have said. But passengers on board the boat insist Israeli troops fired on them without provocation. In the Sunday message, the speaker said Turkey condemns the ""Israeli crimes against our Muslim brothers in Gaza, but still they commit the exact crimes against the Muslims in Afghanistan ... The Turkish people must stand up and be responsible for their government's action in recognizing those who violated and stole the land in Palestine and end the collaboration with the crusaders in killing Muslims in Afghanistan."" The last message purporting to be from al-Zawahiri was on July 27, when he mourned the loss of al Qaeda senior commander Sheikh Mustafa Abu Yazid, killed along with family members. He also called on Muslims to unite behind al Qaeda and wage jihad against their governments if they want change.

"(CNN) -- Double winners Chelsea began the defense of their English Premier League title with a 6-0 drubbing of West Brom, while another promoted club provided the shock of the day as Blackpool thrashed Wigan 4-0. Didier Drogba scored a hat-trick as Chelsea bounced back from last weekend's 3-1 Community Shield defeat by main rivals Manchester United, who take on the third promoted side, Newcastle, on Monday evening. Florent Malouda put the London team ahead in the sixth minute on Saturday evening after West Brom goalkeeper Scott Carson spilled Drogba's free-kick, and the Ivory Coast striker made it 2-0 on the stroke of halftime when he curled another set-piece through a poorly-assembled defensive wall. Ten minutes after the break, Drogba scrambled in his second after John Terry's header was blocked on the line, and midfielder Frank Lampard slotted in on 63 after England teammate Ashley Cole squared the ball into his path. Drogba was the Premier League's top scorer last season with 29 goals, and is on target to repeat that feat after his 68th-minute shot was deflected past Carson off the head of defender Gabriel Tamas. English Premier League preview . It lifted him up to sixth on the club's all-time scoring list with 133 goals, putting him above Jimmy Greaves, who played for Chelsea from 1957-61. France winger Malouda sealed a miserable day for West Brom manager Roberto Di Matteo, a former Chelsea player, as he beat the offside trap and fired in off the post in the 90th minute. It was the biggest opening-day win since the Premier League began in 1992. Blackpool, unable to pay their players bonuses for winning promotion via the playoffs until this month, took a 3-0 lead at halftime against Wigan as striker Gary Taylor-Fletcher netted before a double from new signing Marlon Harewood. Goalkeeper Chris Kirkland was at fault for both Harewood' efforts, and was again exposed in the second half as he was beaten at the near post by Alex Baptiste's shot from the touchline. It was a remarkable day for Blackpool, overwhelming favorites to be relegated in the club's first season in the top flight since 1971, as they ended the day second in the table despite a fruitless summer in the transfer market that finally saw free agent Harewood and three little-known Frenchmen arrive this week. ""I will take a photograph of the table and then retire,"" manager Ian Holloway said. ""It has been a horrible summer and I am quite worn out. This is quite a scary place to be."" In the opening match of the season, Tottenham drew 0-0 with big-spending Manchester City in an early-afternoon battle between last season's fourth and fifth-placed teams. City boss Roberto Mancini fielded three of his five new signings in Yaya Toure, David Silva and Aleksandar Kolarov, but needed young England goalkeeper Joe Hart -- starting ahead of last season's first choice Shay Given -- to keep out a wave of Tottenham attacks. The London side, who face Swiss side Young Boys Berne in the final round of Champions League qualifiers next week, also hit the post through Gareth Bale. City lost Serbia defender Kolarov to injury at halftime, but should have taken the lead through Shaun Wright-Phillips as the winger lost the ball in front of goal. Both sides had several half-chances before Bale also squandered a great chance, and the game petered out in a draw despite a raft of substitutions as Spurs brought on forwards Robbie Keane, Roman Pavlyuchenko and Giovani Dos Santos while City introduced Adam Johnson and Emmanuel Adebayor. Aston Villa, still seeking to replace departed manager Martin O'Neill, crushed West Ham 3-0 in Avram Grant's first Premier League match in charge of the London team. Stewart Downing and Stiliyan Petrov gave the home team a 2-0 lead, then James Milner sealed victory with a 66th-minute strike in what could be the England midfielder's final game for Villa before joining Manchester City. The 24-year-old was given a standing ovation by the crowd when he was substituted late in the game. Blackburn won 1-0 at home to Everton as young Croatian striker Nikola Kalinic took advantage of a mistake by United States goalkeeper Tim Howard to score the 15th-minute winner. Birmingham came from 2-0 down to secure a draw at Sunderland, who had new captain Lee Cattermole sent off in the first half. The home side led in the 24th minute with a penalty from last season's top scorer Darren Bent, then midfielder Cattermole received two yellow cards before defender Stephen Carr -- who had conceded the spot-kick -- headed into his own net 11 minutes into the second half. Scott Dann pulled one back with a header on 78 then defender Gary Ridgewell earned a point two minutes from time. Wolverhampton beat Stoke 2-1 as the visitors lost record signing Kenwyne Jones to injury. Jones, a $12 million buy from Sunderland, hit the crossbar early on but needs a scan after suffering an ankle problem soon after. Wolves took a 2-0 lead at halftime as David Jones and new strike Steven Fletcher scored just before the break, then Abdoulaye Faye gave Stoke hope with a header 10 minutes after the restart. Fulham drew 0-0 at Bolton in manager Mark Hughes' first game in charge, with the home side hitting the post through U.S. midfielder Stuart Holden in the second half. Hughes did not pick veteran Australian goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer, who handed in a transfer request during the week as he seek to join Arsenal. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger signed a new three-year contract ahead of his team's opening match of the season at Liverpool on Sunday. The 60-year-old, the club's longest-serving manager after joining in 1996, is now tied to the London side until June 2014.","English champions Chelsea begin title defense with 6-0 thrashing of West Brom .

"(CNN) -- When Hallie Leighton received the letter from her doctor with the results of her recent mammogram, she opened it tentatively, afraid of what it might say. Her mother and grandmother had both had breast cancer, and she didn't want to suffer the same fate. She was relieved, then, when she read this sentence: ""We are pleased to inform you that the results of your recent breast imaging examination on 04/16/2009 are normal."" A year later, during her annual visit to her gynecologist, Leighton's relief turned to shock. ""My doctor felt a lump, and it was so big, she asked me if I'd gotten implants,"" Leighton, 39, remembers. ""I said no, I don't have implants, and she had me feel it. The whole top of my breast was hard."" The lump was cancer and it was large -- between 6 and 9 centimeters -- and the disease had already spread to her spine. Leighton says her breast surgeon told her the tumor was probably there when she'd had the mammogram the year before. Leighton wondered how the mammogram might have missed a tumor so large. Months later, when she saw the report from the radiologist who'd read the mammogram, she got her answer. Toward the end of the report, the radiologist made this note: ""The breasts are extremely dense, which lowers the sensitivity of mammography."" In layman's terms, this meant Leighton's breast tissue was so thick with fibrous tissue and milk ducts that it was hard to see any cancers that might be there. ""Think of the breast as the sky,"" explains Dr. Mark Helvie, the chief of breast imaging at the University of Michigan Health Center. ""On a clear day, you can see objects in the sky. But when a breast is dense, it's like a foggy day. There are objects in the sky, but you can't see them."" One woman's breast cancer milestones . Not only is it hard to see cancers on a mammogram of a dense breast; just having dense tissue makes you more likely to get breast cancer, Helvie adds. ""I wish I had known all this before,"" Leighton says. ""This was a very important piece of information."" Unfortunately, Leighton's story isn't unusual, says Courtney Bugler, spokeswoman for the Young Survival Coalition, a group of young breast cancer patients and survivors. ""We hear about situations like this all the time,"" Bugler says. ""Mammograms are not a perfect screening tool -- far from it -- but for young women especially, they are often not helpful at all."" Here's how to know when a mammogram might not be enough for you. 1. If you have a strong family history of breast cancer, get an MRI. The American Cancer Society recommends that women with a strong family history of breast cancer get an MRI and a mammogram. The group also recommends MRIs (in addition to mammograms) for women with a BRCA gene mutation, or for women whose parent, brother, sister or child has a BRCA gene mutation. Helvie also recommends getting a digital mammogram, as they are more accurate than a film mammogram. If your insurance company won't pay for it, you can appeal the decision, noting the recommendation to get one from your doctor and from the Cancer Society. If you don't have insurance, contact the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program, the YWCA and your local chapter of the Susan G. Komen Foundation for help finding free or low-cost screening. 2. Get a copy of your mammogram report. As Leighton learned, a letter saying your mammogram is normal isn't always enough. Ask either your gynecologist or the radiologist who performed the mammogram for a copy of the actual report, and then check it to see if there's a notation about the density of your breasts. 3. If you have dense breasts, consider having an ultrasound or MRI . The American College of Radiology recommends that women with dense breast tissue get an MRI. The American Cancer Society says that for women with dense breasts, getting either a mammogram and an ultrasound or getting a mammogram and an MRI can be more effective than getting a mammogram alone. Again, if your insurance company won't pay for an ultrasound or an MRI, appeal the decision, noting your doctor's recommendation to have one plus the information above. 4. Look for your BI-RADS score. Your radiology report should include a BI-RADS score, which indicates how likely you are to have breast cancer. A ""1"" on this scale means your mammogram showed no cancer, and a ""5"" means the mammogram is highly suspicious for cancer. ""Often, a radiologist letter might say everything is fine, when in fact the BI-RADS score might suggest coming back sooner or being followed more closely,"" Bugler says. 5. Talk to your radiologist. Usually, a woman never meets the person who reads her mammograms, but you certainly can try. ""I no longer leave my mammograms without speaking to the radiologist personally,"" says Bugler, whose breast cancer was diagnosed when she was 28. ""I ask the doctor to come out and tell me to my face that everything is fine."" Leighton, who's being treated for her cancer, says it's still not clear to her why her doctors failed to recommend she have an MRI despite her dense breasts and her family history. She says her radiologist and her gynecologist knew that her mother, grandmother, aunt, great-aunt and cousin had had breast cancer. In addition, her other grandmother had ovarian cancer, which is genetically linked to breast cancer. She now wishes she'd asked more questions and used another method of breast cancer detection: her hands. ""That's how my cousin found her breast cancer -- she's an advocate now and even made a video about it,"" Leighton says. ""In my 20s, I was vigilant about doing my breast exams, but I'd fallen out of the routine,"" she says. ""There's a tendency to forget that we have a tool right at our disposal."" CNN's Sabriya Rice contributed to this report.","If breast cancer runs in your family, get a mammogram and an MRI .

"(CNN) -- ""Abusive"" Taliban officials, like the one who ordered the stoning of a young man and woman in northern Afghanistan, shouldn't have positions of authority after a peace deal, a Human Rights Watch official said Thursday. In considering negotiations between the Taliban and coalition and Afghan government officials to end the conflict there, authorities have been amenable to the idea of reconciliation with low-level Taliban, but not all of them -- especially those who've committed violent acts. The question remains of how much sacrifice should be made for the sake of peace. ""The Afghan government has said there will be negotiations with the Taliban. The U.S. government supports that ultimately because we all know that that's the only way to end the war,"" Tom Malinowski, the Washington advocacy director for Human Rights Watch, said on CNN's ""American Morning."" ""When all is said and done, the question is, think about the stoning case up in Kunduz. Can we live with the deal in which the man who ordered the stoning becomes the mayor of that town? ""The question is not whether there will be negotiations, but what the terms of the final deal will be. Will we be able to live with allowing these most abusive Taliban commanders to get positions of authority in the country, and I think that's what needs to be ruled out -- not just because it's wrong but because I think a deal like that won't last, it won't be sustainable. We won't get peace from a deal like that."" The Taliban stoned to death a man and a woman in northern Afghanistan for allegedly having an affair, officials said Monday, an execution President Hamid Karzai called ""unforgivable."" The stoning took place Sunday in Dasht-e-Archi district, in the Taliban-dominated village of Mullah Qali in Kunduz province. The pair was accused of having an illicit sexual relationship, a spokesman for the Kunduz governor said. The woman was about 20 years old and the man was about 27, said Mohammed Ayoub, district governor of Amam Sahib, which is also in Kunduz province. The woman was engaged, and the man was married to another woman. The two had been held by the Taliban for about a week, Ayoub said. Malinowski there's been ""a lot more brazen behavior by the Taliban in the parts of the country that they pretty much control, such as executions of people regarded, for example, as collaborators or against women who try to go to school. ""This is the first time they've actually publicly executed somebody in front of a crowd of people,"" Malinowski said. ""It tells me there are a lot of parts of Afghanistan where the government is just absent. There's no government there. There's no U.S. military there. There's no formal justice system there, and so the Taliban can fill the vacuum -- and when they do, this is what they do.""","Reconciliation shouldn't include abusive Taliban, HRW official says .

"(CNN) -- Walking a mile in someone else's shoes might be challenging, but it's probably not as emotionally taxing as spending every moment with that person for eight straight days. Filmmaker Andrew Jenks, 24, discovered this when he set out to star in, direct and produce his latest project, MTV's ""World of Jenks."" The docu-series follows Jenks as he jumps from various people's worlds: A rapper, a homeless girl, a cage fighter and others. This isn't the first time Jenks has laced-up a pair of someone else's shoes. At 19, he spent the summer as a resident of an assisted living facility in Florida. During his time at the facility, Jenks starred in, directed and produced ""Andrew Jenks, Room 355,"" a feature film that HBO eventually bought the rights to and aired in 2008. "" 'Room 335' was pretty much just humanizing senior citizens,"" he told CNN. ""It was nothing more, nothing less. They're just incredible character portraits of these people -- of these senior citizens that just had no voice, but had so many incredible things to say."" Each episode of ""World of Jenks"" could be compared to a shorter ""Room 355,"" he said. ""I feel like this show is that, but for my generation,"" he said. ""That's what kind of makes it special for me."" CNN spoke with Jenks about his show, which will premiere on Monday at 10 p.m., ET, on MTV. How has this experience affected your personal life? Well I don't have one. It's easy. How do you have these experiences and then go back to being Andrew? I don't really. No one's ever asked that before. I don't know. It's weird because every time I leave one of these worlds, I'm back for like, a week, then we go and we shoot another one. And for that week that I'm back, it's kind of weird -- I almost feel like I am that person still. Like, after we hung out with the poker player, I realized the week after I was kind of walking like he did. There was another cage fighter who just had a certain way of speaking and I kind of started to use a lot of the words he was using. ... To be with someone for eight days, nonstop, and be trying to get who they are and what they stand for -- it's really, really intense. If anything, it kind of screws with your head a little bit in that you're speed living. Do other people notice these changes? No. It's not that crazy. It's not like I'm a schizo or something. It's just something I kind of notice myself. ... I think anyone would do this if they spent eight days with somebody -- just start picking up some of the funnier words they've been using, or if they walk a certain way or if they carry themselves a certain way. After I was with the rapper, I remember, for the next week I was cursing so much. I was like, ""What am I doing?"" You get absorbed into that world. Is one week enough time to spend in someone else's shoes? Oh yeah. One week. It's interesting because it's kind of almost like a science: The first two or three days, the subject is a little bit skeptical, a little bit apprehensive about really opening up. Once they really get to know me and what, I think, myself and our team is really about, they kind of buy into it a little more. Then, by day five or six, they're really opening up. And then by seven or eight, you've really gotten to know this person and, if you're not friends with them for life, you definitely will have their number in your cell phone. How did you find each subject? It's really tough. That's the hardest part because there's so many unique young people out there that are doing incredible, incredible things. To narrow it down to 12 was really hard. We have a research team -- for instance, I'll say, ""We're interested in doing a homeless kid, or we're interested in following someone with autism or we're interested in a cage fighter,"" and then our research team will investigate those worlds and see who are the different characters out there that are interesting. The one thing we're really, really, conscious of is trying to find people that don't necessarily want to be on reality TV, or be on a TV show, I should say. What's one an example of a great subject? We went to an exceptional children's school in Westchester [New York] and we just interviewed the 30 kids there. And there was this one kid who popped up from the interview that just had an incredible, incredible objective sense of what he had, which was autism. And he still had the ability to be really funny. You didn't feel bad for him. He kind of shed a new light on autism. You're the star of ""World of Jenks"" and you're behind the scenes as well? Yeah. I consider myself more of a director than anything. I'm directing the episodes, I'm an EP [executive producer] on the show. I'm definitely involved in the editing process as much as I can be, when I'm not actually on the road shooting. ... If anything, it's a bit odd to be in front of the camera. ... I'm almost in front of the camera by default, if anything. How important was it for you to have creative control? Any director would be crazy to say that's not something they seek. I've been in on all of the creative control and I really mean this ... [MTV] has really let me and my team execute our vision in terms of the show that we really want to put on screen. That's something I was extremely conscious of going into the process. I want to be a filmmaker. I want to make movies down the road ... so, venturing into this sort of terrain, I was certainly apprehensive. I didn't want to be labeled as being in a reality show. Not that there's anything wrong with that, of course, but I just didn't want to take that career route. What's one thing you've taken away from this experience? It's incredible what's at stake for each individual that we live with. The cage fighter that we followed, he was just this big bulky cage fighter and you thought he just beats people up for a living in a cage. But I think, really, we got to know him and he took us to his father's grave site. His dad had been brutally murdered. He just started -- we had the cameras a little bit farther away so he was able to forget about them a little bit -- and he just started crying and talking to his dad. He just started to get really emotional and crying and opening up about what that was like. He said he feels like he's fighting still for his dad and it reminds him of when he used to do karate with his father. It's those sort of moments, where you realize, ""Geez, there's so much as stake for this person."" I kind of find that in every experience.","Docu-series ""World of Jenks"" will premiere on Monday at 10 p.m., ET .

"(CNN) -- Nancy Grace's new novel, ""Death on the D-List,"" is the sequel to her debut thriller, ""The Eleventh Victim."" The mystery once again features Grace's heroine, Hailey Dean, along with many other carryover characters. Grace spoke to CNN.com about the novel, her toddler twins Lucy and John, and more. CNN: How did you come up with the title? Nancy Grace: Well, it's funny, I was thinking and thinking and couldn't come up with a good title, and on ""The Eleventh Victim,"" I came up with about 20 titles, all of which I liked a little bit, and I just picked one and it was ""The Eleventh Victim."" ""Death on the D-List,"" I had been racking my brain for the right title, and one night it was late, and I was rocking Lucy, who would not go to sleep, and it was completely dark and I was holding her against my shoulder, rocking and humming, and it hit me -- it hit me in the dark, ""Death on the D-List."" That was it! Read an excerpt from ""Death on the D-List"" CNN: Who are some of the main characters from ""The Eleventh Victim"" that we're going to find in ""Death on the D-List""? Grace: Well of course you're going to see Hailey Dean, who managed to live through a murder attempt in ""The Eleventh Victim."" She returns to New York, where she gets lured into the TV industry, and murder ensues. You know what? You've got to watch out hanging around Hailey Dean -- someone's going to die!  Also, we see Lt. Ethan Kolker. Kolker is the one who wrongfully pursued Hailey and arrested her for serial murder. And here you see him in an entirely different light. You also learn something disturbing about his past that makes him who he is today. Also, of course, you can't have a great book without a drunk photographer, so Frank LaGrange Haddon III is back again with his camera causing all kinds of trouble. Last time, he caught the judge in a toilet stall with a transvestite. Well, this time, he's back on it! And actually, Frank LaGrange Haddon III is an homage to my law school study partner, the REAL Frank LaGrange Haddon III, who is now a clerk to the Mississippi Supreme Court. And Mike Walker, who works for The Enquirer, he's their gossip editor, makes a rather large appearance in this case, under his name -- Mike Walker -- but he is now working for Snoop magazine. Of course, Hailey's parents, Elizabeth and Matt Dean, are back. CNN: ""Death on the D-List"" features a daytime talk show host. Who is he modeled after? Grace: Harry Dodd is modeled after a character that I saw in a movie called ""For Your Consideration."" He is modeled after the character played by Fred Willard. He's a 50- to 60-year-old entertainment reporter who's desperately trying to convince himself he's about 28 to 31 years old. He follows every fashion trend. He's just vapid, but wildly popular. CNN: Is the Hailey Dean character based on you? Grace: Well, there are some similarities, but Hailey Dean is by far a finer and better person than I could ever be. She's extremely brave, she's fast on her feet, she's a great lawyer, she's sharp-witted and she's got a pretty good right punch. CNN: Are any scenes in your book based on events you've witnessed in your own life? Grace: Well, a lot of scenes take place in studios. So some parts reflect experiences I've had in studios across the country. CNN:  Why is ""Death on the D-List"" a good end-of-summer read? Grace: Well, I had such a blast writing it that I hope people are going to have the same blast when they read it. I don't think you can guess who the killer is until the very end, and I'm going to be very interested to see who can guess who the killer is ahead of time without flipping to the back and spoiling the surprise. It's a great, fun read. I utilized a lot of what I learned as a prosecutor about crime scenes, autopsies and forensic evidence ... a lot of pop culture. Plus, a lot of what I've learned from being on the air since the early '90s, all in one ball of wax! CNN: Can we expect to see more Hailey Dean mysteries in the future? Grace: Oh yes! I've already planned out two more Hailey Dean murder mysteries. CNN: Would you like to see the Hailey Dean mysteries made into feature films? Grace: Oh gosh, yeah, I think it'd be a great movie. CNN: How are the twins? Grace: I'm on my way home to give them a bath now. And they each have to have their individual bath times. They do not like to share a bath. Very often, I go to the set completely soaking wet. Several people have asked me who I dedicated the book to. And it's dedicated to Bigness, Gerger and Man-man. Bigness is my husband -- he's 6-foot-4, and I'm 5-foot 1½ -- and I've called him Bigness ever since I've known him. Gerger is Lucy, and my little baby Man-man is John David. And if you look in the back, you'll see that I wrote a specific note thanking (CNN Worldwide President) Jim Walton and (CNN Worldwide Vice President) Ken Jautz, who are NOT the inspiration for any of the characters in this book that I murdered, especially after all the opportunities they've given me. Nobody that gets murdered or appears in these pages is modeled after them. CNN: Tell us about the charity that will benefit from the book.  Watch: Nancy Grace pledges proceeds from book . Grace: A portion of the book's proceeds are going to Wesley Glen Ministries through my Methodist church to support a home for the mentally handicapped that need homes that don't necessarily have anywhere to go.","Nancy Grace's new novel, ""Death on the D-List,"" goes on sale Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- Christine O'Donnell's upset win over Rep. Mike Castle in the Delaware Republican Senate primary is also another major victory for the Tea Party Express and for Sarah Palin. ""I also want to thank the Tea Party Express,"" said O'Donnell in her victory speech Tuesday night. The Tea Party Express, a leading Tea Party organization, endorsed O'Donnell on July 21 and spent more than $250,000 to help the once long shot candidate defeat Castle, a brand name in Delaware thanks to two terms as governor and the past 18 years as the statewide congressman. O'Donnell's victory comes two weeks after Sen. Lisa Murkowski conceded to Joe Miller in Alaska's GOP Senate primary. The Tea Party Express pumped in about $600,000 to help the once unknown Miller edge out Murkowski, part of a political dynasty in Alaska. Tea Party Express is one of the most recognized national Tea Party organizations, thanks to its three high-profile bus caravans and rallies. The group, based in Sacramento, California, has also become a major player in Republican Party politics, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on ads for Republican Senate candidate Scott Brown in Massachusetts, who in January upset Democrat Martha Coakley in a special election to fill the late Sen. Ted Kennedy's seat. More recently, the organization helped the little-known Sharron Angle win the Republican primary in Nevada, endorsing her and spending about a half-million dollars on ads. Angle now faces off in the general election against Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, the top Democrat in the chamber. Tea Party Express, along with other Tea Party groups and other conservative organizations, also targeted incumbent Republican Sen. Bob Bennett in Utah for his vote on the Troubled Assets Relief Program and helped defeat his bid for a fourth term. Tea Party Express then backed underdog Mike Lee's successful primary campaign in Utah and Lee now is heavily favored to win the general election in November and join the Senate next year. The group also endorsed Rand Paul in Kentucky. The son of former GOP presidential hopeful and Texas Rep. Ron Paul topped Kentucky Secretary of State Trey Grayson, the establishment Republican candidate, in the state's Senate primary. They also endorsed Marco Rubio in Florida. The former Florida House speaker, once a long shot to win the Republican Senate nomination, is now the party's nominee. The onetime front-runner, Gov. Charlie Crist, dropped his bid for the GOP nomination and is running for the Senate as an independent candidate. Among its rare statewide defeats: The Tea Party Express backed state lawmaker Chuck DeVore in California's Senate primary. He lost to Carly Fiorina. It also supported Rep. Todd Tiahrt in Kansas. Fellow Republican Rep. Jerry Moran beat Tiahrt in the primary. So what's the secret to the Tea Party Express' success? ""They have cut right to the chase. They have a very uncomplicated message that resonates with voters who think Washington's problems are quite simple and quite obvious: We're spending too much money, government is too big and we can't trust career politicians to fix these problems. And voters are indicating they would much rather try something or someone new instead of sticking with the status quo or the safe pick,"" said Republican strategist Kevin Madden. But not all the news for the Tea Party Express has been positive. Earlier this summer, the National Tea Party Federation, which seeks to represent the Tea Party political movement around the country, expelled the Tea Party Express because of an inflammatory blog post that one of its leaders, Mark Williams, wrote responding to criticism of the Tea Party movement from the NAACP. The story made national headlines and Williams later stepped down as spokesman for Tea Party Express. O'Donnell's victory is also a big win for Palin. ""Thank you Gov. Palin for your endorsement,"" said O'Donnell. ""She got behind us war-weary folks and gave us a boost of encouragement when we needed it."" On September 9, the former Alaska governor and the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee endorsed O'Donnell. One day before the primary, a recording of Palin urging Delaware Republicans to vote for O'Donnell was blasted to voters by robo-calls across the state. Many statewide candidates that Palin has endorsed have done well in this year's Republican primaries. Alaska's Miller was one of three Palin-backed statewide candidates running in the August 24 primaries who went on to victory. She also endorsed Arizona Sen. John McCain, the former presidential candidate who rocketed Palin to stardom in 2008 when he selected her as his running mate. Though members of the Tea Party movement lined up against the longtime Arizona senator, Palin stayed loyal to McCain and appeared at a campaign event with him in March. Addressing long-standing concern among conservatives McCain is too centrist, Palin said the Arizona senator is driven by ""common-sense conservative principles"" and touted his steadfast opposition to the Obama administration. McCain beat former Rep. J.D. Hayworth by more than 30 points. In the race for Florida attorney general, Palin backed Pam Bondi, a Tampa prosecutor who faced the better-known Lt. Gov. Jeff Kottkamp for the job. Palin's endorsement of Bondi came about a week before the vote and even surprised Bondi, who had no notice Palin would take to her Facebook page to back the campaign. Bondi came out on top in a three-candidate field. In August, several Palin-endorsed candidates suffered losses in statewide Republican primaries. She backed Tea Party activist and former NFL player Clint Didier, who was easily defeated by Dino Rossi for the Senate nomination in Washington. Wyoming State Auditor Rita Meyer, who had Palin's backing, narrowly lost her bid for the GOP gubernatorial nomination. Palin campaigned in person with former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel, who lost a runoff to former Rep. Nathan Deal for the state's Republican nomination for governor. Palin also endorsed Tea Party Express-backed Tiahrt, who was defeated in the battle for the Senate nomination in Kansas. Earlier in the primary season, Palin successfully backed statewide candidates such as Nikki Haley in South Carolina, Terry Branstad in Iowa and Susana Martinez in New Mexico, who all won gubernatorial nominations, and Fiorina in California and Paul in Kentucky, who captured Senate nominations.

Lexus is a division of Toyota. ""Toyota and the Saylor and Lastrella families reached an amicable agreement in mediation that fully resolves their product liability claims against Toyota and a Lexus dealership,"" Brian R.

"London, England (CNN) -- Dutch soccer legend Edgar Davids is confident that South Africa can make a good job of hosting the World Cup, and that the Rainbow nation will benefit from the continent's first staging of football's showpiece tournament. The 37-year-old, who won 74 caps in an 11-year international career, was named in FIFA's team of the tournament after helping the Netherlands finish fourth in France in 1998. He has not played at the top level since his contract with Dutch club Ajax finished in 2008, since when he has focused on personal projects and ambassadorial roles, and played in Zinedine Zidane's Haiti charity match in January. Davids told CNN that he visited South Africa last year and was impressed by the set-up. Have your say on the World Cup. Click here to become a CNN Super Fan. ""I think they will get a lot out of it because you get a lot of media attention and also a financial injection, of course,"" he said. ""They can show the world how warm the African population is. I was there three months ago and I was very surprised about how everything is going. I felt very welcome."" Can an African team win the World Cup? Born in the small South American country of Suriname, Davids was dubbed ""The Pitbull"" in his early years at Ajax by coach Louis Van Gaal, and his Juventus boss Marcelo Lippi called the midfielder ""my one-man engine room."" Davids believes African teams can shine at the World Cup, especially now many of their stars have adapted to the European style of play. ""There's always an African team that will be a dangerous outsider because, at the end of the day, a lot of African players now play abroad,"" he said. ""They have adapted to the European style that was always lacking in the African culture. I think they can adapt a bit and maybe have a run from the outside for a chance at the title."" Nurturing football's grassroots . Since leaving Ajax, Davids has concentrated on his Street Soccer projects, which include his own video game and clothing brand, and he turned down a chance to join English second division club Leicester last October. South Africa's football fanbase has long resided in its poor black population, and Davids believes nurturing the grassroots level is vital. ""It has a social purpose where we go to the bad neighborhoods and help them in a way to really lift up a community,"" he said of Street Soccer. ""I was so involved with that that I left my football aspirations aside, and I only want to return if there's something really really good for me to let this go. I was very fortunate to have a career like this, I wanted to put a lot back for the community. Interactive: Discover Johannesburg's new Soccer City stadium . ""Almost every football player played on the streets. And also a lot of people, not ending up as football players, play on the streets. It's the beginning of a lot of social gathering. And nowadays kids, with the media of mobile phones, computer games, television, they stay in the house instead of moving and just enjoying themselves. Also the social context is very important nowadays. ""Through soccer, you see also with the World Cup -- it attracts so much more, it's binding a lot of things. It's the same thing that happens with Street Soccer, there's so many things around it. ""We get approached by a lot of schools to work together with them and develop a program where we can help younger guys who drop out of school to stay in school and then say they can work in our projects."" Dutch prospects at South Africa 2010 . At the World Cup, which kicks off on June 11, Davids has high hopes for the Netherlands, who face Denmark, Japan, Cameroon in Group E in South Africa. ""I think they will go through to the finals. If they play as a team, they will definitely go to the finals,"" he said. ""If you look at the players individually, we have very good players. The thing is being a team.

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- A Kurdish separatist movement has denied involvement in a bombing Thursday that killed nine people in a southeastern Turkish province, an explosion that drew swift condemnation and a vow to respond from Turkey's prime minister. The Kurdistan Workers' Party, known as the PKK, said the cease-fire it declared last month, which is slated to expire September 20, ""is still continuing."" ""Our decision will definitely remain the same unless a new serious situation emerges,"" said a PKK statement published on Firat News Agency, a pro-Kurdish website. The casualties -- which included four wounded -- occurred when a minibus drove over a landmine in a Hakkari province village.  Provincial officials initially said 10 people had died, but amended that count. In a news release sent to CNN, the PKK blamed the attack on what it called pro-government contra-guerrillas. Later, the PKK warned the Turkish government, saying, ""The people of Hakkari is [sic] not alone."" The cease-fire had been declared for the Muslim month of Ramadan, which ended last week.  It was issued in response to a call from Kurdish intellectuals and civil society organizations. Speaking at an event in Istanbul, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that ""terrorism"" is forcing Turkey to ""pay a price."" ""This will not be without a response,"" he said. The volatile southeastern region is home to Turkey's ethnic Kurdish minority and the PKK, a one-time separatist group considered a terrorist organization by the Turkish government. Turkey is reeling from a bloody summer of clashes with the PKK, the latest in a conflict that has simmered for more than 25 years. More than 30,000 people, mostly ethnic Kurds, have been killed. Initially, the PKK fought to carve out a separate homeland for Turkey's ethnic Kurdish minority, which makes up roughly 20 percent of the Turkish population. But in recent years, the rebels have said they are giving up their demands for an independent Kurdish state, and are instead fighting for more cultural freedoms. CNN's Ivan Watson contributed to this story.","Erdogan vows to respond to explosion in southeast Turkey .

"Boston, Massachusetts (CNN)  -- At one time in the Stem Cell Program at Children's Hospital in Boston, we had two liquid nitrogen containers, one labeled P, the other NP. These containers were used to store batches of stem cells. The P, or presidential container, held some of the 21 embryonic stem cell lines that researchers could study using federal funds under the terms of President George W. Bush's August 2001 executive order. The NP, or nonpresidential, container held those embryonic stem cells derived from later lines, which researchers could not study using federal funding. We were required to purchase and store separately the pipettes and culture dishes, duplicating effort and costs. The separation included detailed record keeping, and I hired a grant manager to deal with these issues.  From a logistical standpoint this was a nightmare. We offered courses on how to proceed in the lab while monitoring the funding source. This separation greatly inhibited progress in the study of many diseases, from blood diseases such as sickle cell anemia to Parkinson's to juvenile diabetes, and the development of potential therapies. Fast forward to March 2009, when President Obama lifted the ban on using federal funds to study stem cell lines developed after the Bush order went into effect.  Scientists were freed to work collaboratively within labs, across labs and across continents. Single studies could now evaluate more embryonic stem cells and use different types of stem cells -- not only embryonic, but the newer induced pluripotent stem, or iPS, cells. But now stem cell research -- a promising avenue in biomedical research for curing a host of deadly and debilitating diseases -- has been dealt an enormous setback by a U.S. District Court's injunction against the Obama executive order. In ruling that federal monies can not be used for any research involving embryonic stem cells, Judge Royce Lamberth's decision creates significant uncertainty in the field. A stay was ordered this week, rescuing the funding of the research for a short time until the case is heard. The fact that research can be shut down and then started again in a matter of weeks has created confusion for proceeding with the work. With Judge Lamberth's decision, American scientists have been put at a disadvantage against their counterparts all over the world. The U.S. is in danger of being surpassed as the leader in biomedical research by several countries, including South Korea, Singapore, and Great Britain. The loss of research competitiveness undermines our biotech and pharmaceutical companies' ability to bring new therapies to patients. Judge Lamberth's decision places American researchers in a difficult position. Promising avenues of research will need to be halted. NIH grant decisions on major diseases were halted this month, even for studies including a small number of experiments on embryonic stem cells, and millions of dollars that have been committed to stem cell researchers is at risk. The economic impact of this injunction on the United States could surely be huge. Scientists run increased risks of running afoul of the law and will be increasingly isolated from their colleagues overseas. While many will seek private and foundational funding for their research, this also comes with a price. Before the Obama order, many elite researchers were spending up to 20 percent of their time on fundraising. We risk that the U.S. will fall increasingly behind. This decision is driven both by ideology as well as continuing confusion over the science of stem cells. Eighty percent of Americans are in favor of stem cell research, and Congress has twice passed a bill in favor of stem cell research. More education is necessary so that everyone understands these cells. At Children's Hospital, we have created a website that provides basic information about stem cells, their biology and potential for therapies. Despite the plaintiff's allegations and the judge's apparent concurrence, it makes no sense from either a research or therapeutic standpoint to pit adult stem cell against embryonic stem cell research. Think about the chaos that would be created if a heart researcher could file an injunction saying they were harmed and poorly funded because they are in competition with diabetes research. Giving artificial and unmerited research preference to one type of organs or cells over another would completely undermine the federal peer review process and funding strategy, and more important, would absolutely constrain ongoing searches for treatments and therapies. As a hematologist, I have used adult blood stem cells from bone marrow to treat patients with leukemia. I cannot think that any scientist or patient would view blood stem cell research as ""in competition"" with embryonic stem cell research. Embryonic stem cells were the essential key to discovering how to reprogram adult skin cells, and the ultimate therapeutic success of these new reprogrammed cells absolutely will require additional embryonic stem cell research. Unlocking the potential of stem cells to cure disease requires comparisons of both adult and embryonic tissues. These are not two warring sciences; they are both integral parts of the single field of stem cell research. As the founding president of the International Society for Stem Cell Research, I know that the most respected scientists and researchers who work on adult and embryonic tissues are working together. The position of embryonic stem cell and reprogrammed stem cell research now is similar to where we were in the mid-1970s with bone marrow transplantation. In 1975, the science was still relatively young and no transplants had yet taken place. But over the next decade, bone marrow transplants moved from unknown and experimental to widely accepted and standard therapy. In issuing an injunction against President Obama's order, Judge Lamberth cited the potential harm to federal funding of adult stem cell research from the federal support of embryonic stem cell research. The irony is that this decision is a blow to all research, and with it to America's economic competitiveness and to the hopes of countless families for a cure. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Leonard I. Zon.","Federal judge halted federal funding for research using embryonic stem cells .

"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- An 80-year-old Roman Catholic priest was found stabbed to death in his church in the city of Oaxaca, in southern Mexico, CNNMexico.com reported Thursday, citing state police. The Rev. Carlos Salvador Wotto was found in the church office Wednesday night with several stab wounds and bound hands and feet, CNNMexico reported. Wotto had been the parish priest at Nuestra Senora de las Nieves (Our Lady of the Snow) for eight years. State and local authorities were investigating and no motive was immediately given. Jose Guadalupe Barragan, a spokesman for the Archdiocese of Antequera, said church officials would wait for the investigation to end before commenting. Barragan said there is a shortage of priests in Oaxaca. The national norm is one priest for every 5,000 parishioners, he said, while there are only 140 priests for Oaxaca's 3 million inhabitants. That amounts to one priest for about every 21,400 residents. Wednesday's homicide was the second recent incident in the state of Oaxaca involving a priest. The Rev. Martin Octavio Garcia Ortiz from the town of San Jose del Progreso was abducted June 19 in a dispute over a local mine. State police rescued Garcia and then arrested him on charges that he was responsible for the deaths of two officials who were shot after an anti-mine rally. Garcia, who said he was tortured by his pro-mining abductors, was hospitalized with head and body injuries.","NEW: No motive was immediately given .

"(CNN) -- Nigeria's ruling party has set its presidential primaries for next month, a spokesman said Thursday. The primaries will be held between October 18 and 20, said Rufai Alkali, a spokesman for the People's Democratic Party. A single candidate will be ratified on October 23, Alkali said. On Wednesday, President Goodluck Jonathan said he intends to run, and will make a formal declaration on Saturday. ""In presenting myself for service, I make no pretense that I have a magic wand that will solve all of Nigeria's problems or that I am the most intelligent Nigerian,"" Jonathan wrote on his Facebook page. ""Far from it. What I do promise is this -- if I am elected president in 2011, I will make a covenant with you, the Nigerian people, to always do right by you, to tell you the truth at all times, to carry you along and most importantly to listen to you, fellow citizens in our communities, and also those of you on this page."" Jonathan's eligibility was in question until last month, when the Peoples Democratic Party said he could run in an open race with other candidates next year. Under Nigerian ""zoning"" rules, power must shift to different regions and ethnic groups every eight years. Jonathan -- who is from the Niger Delta, in the south -- was part of the joint ticket of the late President Umaru Yar'Adua, who was from the north. Yar'Adua's death in May, after a long illness, upset the order of the zoning. Yar'Adua was elected in 2007 and his southern replacement threatened to halt the north's turn at holding power. CNN's Christian Purefoy contributed to this report.","President Jonathan says he will formally declare his candidacy Saturday .

"(CNN) -- Juventus remain without a win after two Italian Serie A games after being held to a 3-3 home draw by Sampdoria. Two goals from Nicola Pozzi and another from Antonio Cassano helped the visitors to a point, with Claudio Marchisio, Simone Pepe and Fabio Quagliarella all on target for the home side. The result leaves Luigi del Neri's side still without a win and struggling near the foot of the table following their opening 1-0 defeat by Bari two weeks ago. Unfancied Verona-based minnows Chievo are the unlikely early Serie A leaders and have a 100 per cent record after two games following their 3-1 win at Genoa.

"(CNN)  -- Novak Djokovic and his female counterparts Ana Ivanovic and Jelena Jankovic have transformed Serbia into one of the leading tennis nations in the world with their well-chronicled achievements in the past few seasons. Djokovic reached a career high ranking of number two in the world earlier this year, Jankovic went one better and briefly topped the women's rankings in 2008 while Ivanovic claimed grand slam glory at the French Open in the same year. It is a remarkable record for a country of approximately 10 million people and with no great tradition in tennis, rather a passion for team sports such as football (Serbia qualified for the 2010 World Cup finals) and basketball. Djokovic aside, Serbia has also produced Janko Tipsarevic and Viktor Troicki, who are both ranked in the top 50 on the ATP tour, giving them a formidable Davis Cup team. With Djokovic leading the way and winning the conclusive rubber against John Isner, Serbia beat the might of the United States in the World Group first round earlier this month to reach the quarterfinals of the competition for the first time. They will now play neighboring Croatia for a place in the semifinals. In times past the two countries formed part of the old Yugoslavia, who reached the last four of the competition in 1988, the following year, and 1991. The Serbian women's team reached the World Group playoffs of the Fed Cup in 2007, but with Jankovic and Ivanovic in the ranks have the potential to challenge for top honors in years to come. Djokovic puts an unusual slant on the reasons for the success of the current crop of Serbian players, tracing it back to the crisis of 1999 when NATO planes bombed Belgrade before the regime of president Slobodan Milosevic was removed. Djokovic celebrated his 12th birthday during the bombings and like other youngsters was not allowed to go to school because of the dangerous situation. It left him and other leading players with no alternative but to practice tennis for four or five hours on end day after day. ""But still you know it (the war) gave me a lot of hours on the tennis court and I was very happy about it,"" he told CNN. ""But in those conditions, in those times, you have players like Jelena Jankovic, Ana Ivanovic, Tipsarevic, myself, all these guys went through that. ""I think it is a question that has been raised and asked to all of us, for last two, three years, how come you are coming from such a small country with so many problems and you still managed to become top players you know,"" he added. Djokovic says that the bonds that were forged in those trying times has given all those involved a double sense of purpose. ""As a small country we got united in those critical times and we supported each other and right now that the country is prospering and it has turned its intentions towards the West and I am happy with the situation as it is now,"" he added. Prior to the current clutch of star players, the most famous home-grown talent produced by Serbia was former world number one Monica Seles, who fostered her talent in the old Yugoslavia. Seles was born in Novi Sad and at the age of 11 won her category at the renowned Orange Bowl tournament in Florida where she was spotted by noted coach Nick Bollettieri. It prompted a move to the United States where she later became a naturalized citizen and multi grand slam champion.","Djokovic reached a career high ranking of number two in the world in 2010 .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- More than 10,000 anti-government demonstrators gathered in the heart of Bangkok's shopping district Sunday to mark the fourth anniversary of a bloodless coup that ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. The peaceful demonstration lasted about four hours under scattered rain. One of the city's main intersections was again flooded with ""Red Shirt"" demonstrators -- so named for the color of their clothing -- resembling the picture when the group occupied the area from March to May until a crackdown by the government's security forces that left 91 people dead and more than 2,000 injured. The crowd chanted ""there are deaths here!"" Several symbolic activities were performed by the demonstrators, including tying red robes and forming a giant spider web, lying on the street to represent the dead, and lighting red candles around the area. Balloons tied with letters were released into the sky. Red Shirt leader Sombat Boon-ngamanong, who organized the demonstration, told his supporters to leave the area around 5 p.m. (6 a.m. ET), although some people lingered. The demonstration ended peacefully. Similar activities were held in Chiang Mai, Nong Khai, and in the north and northeastern parts of the country, according to local media. Bangkok and six other provinces remain under emergency rule, which the government imposed in April. The decree allows authorities to detain suspects without formal charges up to three months. The Red Shirts support Thaksin, who was ousted in a bloodless military coup in 2006 while he was attending a U.N. assembly. His supporters protested for weeks, demanding that Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva dissolve parliament and call new elections. Thaksin briefly returned to Thailand to fight a corruption charge, but fled again in 2008. He left before Thailand's Supreme Court convicted him of abusing his power and purchasing land owned by his wife.","Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra was ousted in a bloodless coup .

"(CNN)  -- English giants Manchester United have splashed out a reported $10 million on an unknown 20-year-old striker whose only previous professional experience is playing in the third-flight of Portuguese football. Tiago Manuel Dias Correia, known as ""Bebe"", has signed from Vitoria de Giumaraes and will be hoping to follow in the footsteps of the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Nani in making a big impression at Old Trafford. Bebe has a compelling story, having been raised in a youth shelter in his home town of Cacem on the outskirts of Lisbon. He played his early football for CAIS, an organization responsible for Portugal's National Homeless Team, and was soon spotted by his first professional club Estrela Amadora. Bebe's displays for them attracted the attention of scouts from more prominent clubs and he was snapped up by Portuguese first division Vitoria de Giumaraes just five weeks ago. He has yet to play a game in the top flight of his national league, but his performances in warm-up matches were enough for United to step in, leaving Giumaraes with a quick profit. Reports say that Carlos Queiroz, Alex Ferguson's former assistant, tipped off the Manchester United manager about Bebe's talents after he scored four goals in seven friendly appearances and earned rave reviews. Gonçalo Sequeira dos Santos of CAIS and the manager of Portugal's National Homeless World Cup Team told CNN that he had spoken to Bebe Thursday to congratulate him on his move. Bebe told him: ""I am very happy. Football can change lives, very much."" Dos Santos added: ""Bebe is responsible, with one big heart and an all-round awesome boy. We are truly happy for this opportunity he has to make his dream come true and improving his life."" He is the third signing of the summer for United, who lost their English Premier League crown to arch-rivals Chelsea last season. Defender Chris Smalling from Fulham and Mexico striker Javier Hernandez from Chivas de Guadalajara are the other signings. Bebe may struggle to gain a regular starting slot as he competes with the likes of Hernandez, Wayne Rooney, Dimitar Berbatov, Michael Owen and Federico Macheda. In other transfer news Thursday, Italian international midfielder Mauro Camoranesi's transfer from Juventus to Premier League Birmingham City is in doubt because of the English tax regime, his agent claimed.

"(Health.com) -- Are you pessimistic, chronically worried and stressed-out, and ill at ease socially? You may be at higher risk of heart attack and other heart problems, a new study suggests. People with a history of heart disease who are prone to negative thinking, gloom, and inhibition -- a personality profile known as Type D (for ""distressed"") -- are nearly four times more likely to experience heart attack, heart failure, heart rhythm disorders, death, and other negative outcomes compared to heart patients with a different personality profile, the study found. Health.com: Surprising heart attack risks . ""There is a clear connection between heart risk and psychological risk factors, and those people who have this personality and lack social support have higher risk of health problems,"" says Nieca Goldberg, M.D., director of the Women's Heart Program at New York University's Langone Medical Center. (Goldberg was not involved in the new study.) The lead author of the study, Johan Denollet, Ph.D., a professor of medical psychology at Tilburg University, in the Netherlands, first proposed a Type D personality in the mid-1990s, after he and his colleagues observed that distressed heart-attack survivors had higher short-term mortality rates than people with more upbeat personalities. Type D personalities are ""characterized by negative emotions like anxiety, frustration, and anger, and at the same time score high on social inhibition, meaning that they are less likely to disclose emotions,"" Denollet says. Health.com: 10 things to say (and not say) to someone with depression . The Type D personality was modeled after the better-known Type A and B personalities, which grew out of heart research conducted in the U.S. in the 1950s. The aggressiveness, impatience, and hostility that characterizes the Type A personality has long been linked to an increased risk of heart disease. Experts don't fully understand why the Type D personality appears to affect heart risk. Genes may be partly responsible, but the chronic stress associated with Type D traits is also a likely culprit. Consistently high levels of one stress hormone, cortisol, are a known risk factor for heart attack. ""Stress hormones and stress reactions are great in fight-or-flight -- like when a prehistoric man was being chased by a saber-toothed tiger -- but they are not so good when they flood your body 24/7,"" says Karol Watson, M.D., the co-director of preventive cardiology at UCLA's David Geffen School of Medicine. Health.com: Job killing you? 8 types of work-related stress . Type D personalities may also turn to smoking, alcohol, overeating, and other unhealthy behaviors as a way of coping with their emotions, Watson adds. And, as Denollet points out, ""Type D's are less likely to exercise, and [are] also rather poor at adhering to medical treatment or advice by their doctors."" In the study, which appears in the journal Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes, Denollet and his colleagues re-analyzed data from 19 studies comprising more than 6,000 people. (Denollet led many of the studies himself.) They found that heart patients with type D personalities were 3.7 times more likely than those with other personality types to experience future heart problems. In addition, the Type D patients were three times more likely to experience depression, anxiety, and other forms of emotional distress. The link between heart risk and Type D personality persisted even after the researchers took into account whether the study participants were depressed. This suggests that Type D personality presents a health risk independent of depression, a condition that itself increases the risk of heart disease. Health.com: Loneliness hurts the heart . Type D personality and depression are not the same thing, although there is some overlap between them. While depression tends to occur in episodes, the emotional distress associated with Type D personality is chronic and may never reach the level of clinical depression, according to the study. The findings shine a light on a high-risk population, Goldberg says, adding that doctors should ask patients about their social support systems in an effort to identify those who may have Type D traits. (For just that purpose, Denollet and his colleagues have developed a questionnaire that asks patients to rank how well 14 statements -- such as ""I take a gloomy view of things"" and ""I find it hard to start a conversation"" -- apply to them.) Health.com: 7 types of therapy that can help depression . Type D personalities aren't doomed to heart problems, but they should be aware of their risk and take precautions, such as enrolling in cardiac rehabilitation if they've had a heart attack, the researchers say. ""Type Ds need to take a more active approach toward their own health,"" Denollet says. ""They may benefit from counseling, so that they can learn how to deal with everyday stressful situations in a more adaptive way. There are some proactive tools and actions that these people can take to get rid of the negative emotions they keep inside."" Enter to win a monthly Room Makeover Giveaway from MyHomeIdeas.com .

"(CNET) -- Symbian and Android will dominate the mobile operating system market by 2014, research firm Gartner said Friday. Gartner expects that Symbian and Android together will account for 59.8 percent of the total worldwide mobile OS market by 2014, split almost equally -- Symbian with 30.2 percent, and Android with 29.6 percent. Android is already closing the gap with the market leader. By the end of 2010, Gartner says, Google's Android will sneak into second place behind Nokia-backed Symbian with 17.7 percent market share, compared to Symbian's 40.1 percent. At the end of 2009, Android OS had just 3.9 percent market share, the research firm reported. Gartner's predictions don't bode well for RIM's BlackBerry OS and Apple's iOS. Those platforms, which ended 2009 with 19.9 percent and 14.4 percent of the market, respectively, are expected to take the third and fourth spots this year. In fact, Gartner believes RIM will end the year with 17.5 percent market share, while Apple will capture 15.4 percent of the space. Windows Phone will trail far behind with just 4.7 of the market. But by 2014, when Symbian and Android will be soaring, Gartner expects BlackBerry OS to have just 11.7 percent of the mobile market and iOS to own 14.9 percent. Gartner thinks Symbian will still lead the mobile market in 2014 due to ""Nokia's volume and the push into more mass-market price points."" Android's success can be attributed to ""communication service providers' marketing and vendor support,"" Gartner said. The research firm's findings echo what fellow market researcher IDC announced earlier this week. IDC likewise said that Android OS will take the second spot behind Symbian in 2014, but it pegged Android's worldwide market share at 24.6 percent, compared to Symbian's 32.9 percent. It also believes that Apple's iOS platform will be lower than Gartner's predictions, capturing 10.9 percent of the worldwide market in 2014. RIM's BlackBerry will have 17.3 percent of the mobile market in 2014, IDC predicted. Of course, four years is a long time. And things can change. Nowhere is that more evident at the moment than at Nokia. Late Thursday night, the company announced that it is appointing Stephen Elop, president of Microsoft's Business Division, as its new CEO. Nokia said that Elop will help lead its ""substantial transformation"" from a hardware company to a software company. © 2010 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved.

"(CNN) -- Manchester United got their Premier League campaign off to a winning start with a 3-0 victory over newly-promoted Newcastle United at Old Trafford. Dimitar Berbatov, Darren Fletcher and Ryan Giggs all got on the scoresheet as Newcastle were reminded of the tough task they face to prevent making an instant return to the Championship. Alex Ferguson's side rarely looked threatened as they began their quest to regain the title from Chelsea with a confident showing. But it was Newcastle who had the first clear chance of the game as Andy Carroll met Joey Barton's corner only to head wide from just six yards out. Soon after, Manchester United began to dominate the game as the visitors sank deeper and deeper into their own half. They broke the deadlock on the half hour mark as Argentina midfielder Jonas Gutierrez lost possession and Paul Scholes fed Dimitar Berbatov to power a low shot past Newcastle keeper Steve Harper. Just eight minutes later the home side doubled their advantage due to some sloppy defending from Newcastle. Patrice Evra's cross from the left wasn't dealt with before it ricocheted into the path of Darren Fletcher and the Scotland international had the simple task of turning the ball home from six yards out. Berbatov should have grabbed his second after the break when a neat flick from Rooney put him clear but though his shot beat Harper it rolled the wrong side of the post. Wayne Rooney was taken off after an hour so new Mexican signing Javier Hernandez could get his first taste of Premier League action, as 35-year-old Scholes began to pull the strings. Portugal winger Nani was next to go close as he fired a left foot shot narrowly wide of the far post before Patrice Evra drilled a low cross across the face of goal. Berbatov's neat footwork allowed him a shot on goal inside the area as the game entered the final ten minutes but Harper saved well with his feet. Ryan Giggs replaced Nani and he grabbed the third on 85 minutes with an angled volley into the far corner from a pinpoint Scholes cross. After the match Ferguson purred over Scholes' performance. He told Sky Sports: ""He showed that even at his age you don't lose what you've got. ""His range of passing and vision was marvellous and he's still got the passion to play. He and Ryan Giggs are blessed with something special. ""Three points is always important in your first game and I thought we controlled most of it. It was a steady performance.""","Manchester United beat Newcastle United 3-0 in the Premier League .

Marijuana activist Marc Emery pleaded guilty in May in U.S. District Court in Seattle, Washington, to a single count of conspiracy to manufacture marijuana after an 18-month investigation into the seed-selling business Emery operated from his head shop in Vancouver, British Columbia. By imposing the five-year sentence, which includes four years of supervised probation, U.S. District Judge Ricardo S. Martinez honored a plea deal that Emery, 52, entered into with U.S. authorities to avoid a lengthier sentence. ""There is no question your actions were illegal and criminal and your actions ensured that others broke the law and suffered the consequences,"" the judge told Emery during the hearing. Dozens of Emery's supporters gathered outside Seattle's federal courthouse to protest the sentence, which marks the end of a five-year legal battle against a man once described by U.S. authorities as one of its most wanted international drug trafficking targets -- and the only one from Canada. Emery is the founder of the British Columbia Marijuana Party and the website CannabisCulture.com. His status in Canada as a tireless advocate for marijuana legalization has been cemented through years of sit-ins, demonstrations and runs for political office. By his own account, he has been arrested at least a dozen times since 1995 related to his activism, and Vancouver police have raided his shop several times since it opened in 1994. In his plea agreement, Emery admitted to operating a marijuana seed selling business with two co-defendants, who entered pleas this year to lesser offenses and were placed on probation in Canada. He also admitted to selling seeds to customers in the United States through mail and telephone orders and in his Vancouver retail store. ""Marc Emery decided that U.S. laws did not apply to him, but he was wrong,"" said U.S. Attorney Jenny A. Durkan in a statement Friday. ""Emery put his personal profits above the law. He made millions of dollars by shipping millions of seeds into the U.S. He sold to anyone who would pay him -- with no regard for the age or criminal activities of his customers. Now, Emery is paying the price for being part of the illegal drug trade that damages lives, homes and the environment."" But Emery and his supporters worldwide have maintained from the start that his prosecution was politically motivated, citing a 2005 DEA press release touting his arrest as a ""significant blow"" to the marijuana legalization movement. ""Hundreds of thousands of dollars of Emery's illicit profits are known to have been channeled to marijuana legalization groups active in the United States and Canada. Drug legalization lobbyists have one less pot of money to rely on,"" former DEA Administrator Karen Tandy said in the July 2005 statement, which can no longer be found on the DEA's website. iReport: Emery's wife speaks . Emery's lawyer reminded the judge of the press release in his presentencing memorandum, claiming there are other seed selling businesses in Canada that the U.S. government chose not to go after. ""The only thing that makes Mr. Emery unique or different from most of these other seed sellers is that Marc donated his proceeds to help fund lawful marijuana legalization efforts throughout the United States and Canada. On this record, no one can (or should) take the government seriously when it claims that this case was not politically motivated,"" Richard Troberman wrote. But the U.S. Attorney's Office said that Emery's personal politics had nothing to do with his prosecution. ""Through the years, and in various contexts, Marc Emery has meant different things to many people. But in the context of this federal criminal prosecution, Emery stands before the court as many others have before him -- as an admitted drug dealer who has entered a plea of guilty to a large scale marijuana trafficking conspiracy,"" the U.S. attorney's office wrote in its presentencing memo. ""The government's case was investigated and prosecuted without regard for Emery's personal politics, his political agenda or the ways in which he chose to spend the proceeds of his drug crimes."" With Emery in prison, his wife, Jodie, has become the face behind their cause, which has not fallen dormant in his absence. Rallies to support Emery and the legalization movement will be held in more than 70 cities across the globe on September 18, she said. ""It's going to be a long, difficult road ahead, but we'll be able to make it with all the support we have,"" she said. Emery also remains firm in his beliefs, though in a letter to the court, he admitted his means may have been self-defeating. ""It was my sincere belief that the prohibitions on cannabis are hurtful to U.S. and Canadian citizens and are contrary to the U.S. and Canadian constitutions. I was, however, overzealous and reckless in pursuing this belief, and acted arrogantly in violation of U.S. federal law. I regret not choosing other methods -- legal ones -- to achieve my goals of peaceful political reform.""","Marijuana activist Marc Emery sentenced for selling marijuana seeds to U.S. customers .

"Cavite City, Philippines (CNN) -- Not many people recognized Efren Peñaflorida as he left the Philippines last fall to attend a Hollywood gala for CNN Heroes. But when Peñaflorida returned from the event as CNN's Hero of the Year, he was greeted by hundreds of screaming fans at the airport in Manila. ""The moment we got home, I ... seemed to have become a celebrity,"" he said. Peñaflorida was honored for creating mobile ""pushcart classrooms,"" carts stocked with books, chalkboards and other supplies, that bring education to poor children in the Philippines. Since 1997, he and more than 12,000 teenage volunteers have taught basic reading and writing skills to more than 1,800 children living on the streets. ""The award and the title [are] really significant,"" said Peñaflorida, 29. ""It gave me and my co-volunteers an affirmation that what we are doing is a worthy cause."" The plaudits didn't stop there. Back home, parades were arranged in both Manila and Cavite City, where Peñaflorida was born and raised. And then-President Gloria Arroyo conferred him with the Order of Lakandula -- one of the highest honors that can be bestowed upon a Filipino civilian -- for his dedication to the welfare of society. ""I received the medal but shared the honor with my co-volunteers, my mentor and the children we reach out to,"" he said. ""The government heads received an instruction from the president to have the pushcart schools replicated all over the country."" With Peñaflorida's consultation, the pushcart classroom model started by his nonprofit organization, Dynamic Teen Company, has been replicated more than 50 times by different organizations and institutions across the Philippines. And according to Peñaflorida, more classrooms are pending as President Benigno Aquino's administration reviews plans to expand the infrastructure of the mobile classroom system. ""The duplication of the pushcart school system ... is happening now in different provinces and regions of the country, and we receive numerous letters from other parts of the world,"" Peñaflorida said. ""Filipinos have become more aware of the need for these children to be educated, fed and taken care of. Before, they saw [a pushcart] as a symbol of poverty, but now they see a pushcart as a symbol of hope and education."" In Cavite City, construction is nearly complete on the Dynamic Teen Company's new educational center, which is designed to resemble the iconic pushcart. Partially funded by the CNN Heroes grant of $125,000, the educational center will include a computer lab, a library, a health clinic, a kitchen used for feeding programs and a garage to store the pushcarts. ""We will call it Care for Poor Children Learning Center, where children will experience having a place to exercise their rights freely and learn life-changing principles,"" Peñaflorida said. ""It is intended to be finished by early next year ... and [it] shall be able to serve hundreds of kids."" Peñaflorida says he knows firsthand what these children lack. He spent his childhood in a shanty near a dump site in Cavite City. He founded his organization to provide impoverished children an empowering alternative to gang induction. ""They need education to be successful in life,"" he said. ""It's just giving them what others gave to me."" Peñaflorida's selflessness has inspired documentaries and TV movies about his life in the Philippines and several other countries, including Japan, Korea, Germany, Spain and Canada. Recently, he was invited to bear the torch at the first Youth Olympic Games in Singapore. And he can be seen hosting his own search for heroes on the Philippine television show ""Ako Mismo"" (""I Myself""). The show features people working in the Philippines to better the lives of others. ""I was told ... that they came up with this TV show inspired by the speech I gave at the Kodak Theater, that each person has a hidden hero within ... waiting to be unleashed,"" he said. ""Since I was instrumental in the concept, I must live up to the principles I share and help our country find its heroes and probably help our nation heal herself."" November 22 will be Efren Peñaflorida Day in Cavite City, but Peñaflorida will likely miss the celebration as he plans to be back in Hollywood honoring this year's CNN Heroes. ""They are all awesome,"" he said. ""The works of those 25 souls are so inspiring and truly remarkable. I personally salute them all."" The 2010 Top Ten CNN Heroes will be announced Thursday, September 23 at 1 p.m. on CNN.com. At that time, online voting will begin to select the 2010 CNN Hero of the Year. The Hero of the Year will be revealed Thanksgiving night during ""CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute,"" hosted by Anderson Cooper at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, California.","Efren Peñaflorida was named CNN Hero of the Year at a Hollywood event in 2009 .

"(CNN) -- British TV host Piers Morgan said taking over for retiring Larry King is like replacing Frank Sinatra's Las Vegas show. ""How can you follow a legend like that?"" Morgan said after news that he will take over Larry King's prime-time hour starting January. ""And then you think what a challenge, what an honor to be able to fill the shoes of someone like Larry King -- for me as a TV interviewer, which is primarily what I do back in England. I have watched him over the last 25 years interviewing the most interesting people in the world and to be ... without a doubt the most famous TV interviewer in TV history."" Morgan will replace King's longtime show with ""a candid, in-depth newsmaker interview program,"" CNN announced Wednesday. Morgan, best known to American viewers as a judge on NBC's ""America's Got Talent,"" has most recently hosted ""Piers Morgan's Life Stories"" on television in the United Kingdom. ""Piers has made his name posing tough questions to public figures, holding them accountable for their words and deeds,"" said CNN-US President Jon Klein. ""He is able to look at all aspects of the news with style and humor with an occasional good laugh in the process."" Morgan's show, which was not named in the CNN news release, will air live on CNN-US at 9 p.m. ET and will air worldwide on CNN-International in more than 200 countries, the network said. Morgan will be based in New York, but also will work from Los Angeles and London, CNN said. Morgan named Lindsay Lohan, Mel Gibson, Hillary Clinton, Sarah Palin as some people he'd like to interview. But whom would he want for his first interview?"" ""Larry King would be it,"" Morgan said. ""He knows everybody. I find him fascinating. He has an amazing recall for people and events. I love his enthusiasm."" King announced this summer that he was stepping aside from CNN's ""Larry King Live,"" a show he began hosting in 1985. Morgan, 45, began his journalism career as a newspaper reporter in the United Kingdom for The Wimbledon News. In 1994, when he was 28, Morgan became the youngest editor ever at Rupert Murdoch's News of the World. He moved to the Daily Mirror as editor-in-chief in 1995, a post he held for nine years. He left the Mirror under a cloud of controversy in 2004, after the publication of photos purported to be of abused Iraqi prisoners. The newspaper later acknowledged the images were faked, saying it was the victim of a hoax. Morgan went on to become a television personality, hosting interview programs on the BBC and ITV. Simon Cowell hired Morgan as a judge on the top-rated ""Britain's Got Talent."" His print journalism career continued beyond the Mirror, including a monthly interview column for GQ magazine. Morgan also writes two regular columns for the Mail on Sunday newspaper, which he will continue. In addition, he will provide regular columns to CNN.com, the network said.","NEW: Morgan says he'd like to have Larry King as his first interview .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- A restaurant vestibule normally is a place for patrons to exchange greetings and hold the door for each other. What occurred at an Atlanta restaurant last year turned into much more than that, with allegations of punches, kicks, racial invective and spitting. Testimony providing two different views of the confrontation ended Friday in Clayton County Superior Court, with a man accused of punching and kicking a female patron at a Cracker Barrel restaurant agreeing to a plea deal. He received six months in jail. ""Justice was served,"" District Attorney Tracy Graham Lawson told CNN on Saturday, acknowledging that her case became unraveled when jurors learned the accuser faces charges of her own. Troy Dale West Jr., who is white, was accused of screaming racial slurs while beating Tasha Hill, an African-American female Army reservist, at the Morrow restaurant in September 2009. The Poulan, Georgia, resident faced 44 years if convicted of all charges. Felony charges of aggravated assault and false imprisonment were dropped and he pleaded guilty to four misdemeanors: battery, two counts of disorderly conduct and cruelty to children in the third degree, Lawson said. He has no prior criminal convictions. The state asked for 48 months in jail. West's attorney, Tony Axam, asked for time served. The judge gave him 36 months and suspended all but six. West, who has served 40 days already, was sent to jail. Axam was not immediately available for comment Saturday. West, then 47, was arrested on misdemeanor charges after the incident, but Lawson took the case to a grand jury asking for more serious charges. Hill was with her 7-year-old daughter when the incident occurred at the entrance to the restaurant. Hill, then 35, testified the attack occurred after she warned West to be careful, after she said he almost hit her daughter with the restaurant door as she was leaving. West claimed he was trying to let the girl enter the restaurant. West told police after the arrest that he hit Hill ""after she spit on me and accused me of trying to hit her daughter with a door."" ""She said, 'I'm a U.S. military soldier. I'll kill you,"" West testified Friday. ""As I start to turn away, she spits in my face,"" CNN affiliate WXIA reported Friday. The defendant said he used an open hand rather than a fist. Hill said she did nothing to provoke the alleged attack, adding that West yelled racial epithets at her during the beating. ""I don't feel I've done anything wrong,"" West said to Judge Geronda V. Carter on Friday about his plea. ""But it's in my best interest."" Hill was angry that West did not get more time. ""I didn't ask you to hit me. You beat me down and you need to pay for it,"" she said. ""You said you didn't do anything wrong. You can at least apologize if you did."" Lawson said facts she learned since the indictment and during the trial affected the case. A Cracker Barrel employee who claimed to have witnessed the confrontation was in the back of the restaurant and couldn't have seen it, she said. And two ""very credible"" witnesses were adamant about seeing Hill spit on West, she said. Hill has previous cases involving violent and verbal altercations and is currently charged with disorderly conduct from an incident this summer, Lawson said. Hill is accused of threatening to shoot two boys, claiming they burglarized her home, Lawson told CNN. Lawson said she heard a 911 call about the incident just before the trial began. Hill's attorney declined to comment Saturday. Lawson and an assistant prosecutor said they spoke with jurors after the plea deal. They confirmed they would likely not have convicted West of felonies. ""They felt the resolution was fair,"" the prosecutor said. The district attorney declined to answer whether she would have handled the case differently once she learned about the spitting testimony and cases against Hill. She said she knew of only one previous incident before the trial. During the trial, assistant district attorney Jason Green asked West if it is acceptable to strike a woman. West replied, ""it depends."" Lawson believes West needed to be punished for hitting Hill and using racial epithets. ""I wanted him convicted of something,"" she said.","The incident occurred at a Cracker Barrel in suburban Atlanta .

"(CNN) -- Militants in Pakistan's tribal region attacked a truck carrying supplies for NATO troops in Afghanistan -- killing the driver and his assistant, officials said Friday. Gunmen opened fire and threw petrol bombs, setting the truck and its container on fire, said Muhammad Arshad Khan, a senior government official in Khyber Agency. They then fatally shot the occupants of the truck, Khan said. The torched truck was part of two-truck convoy headed toward the Torkham border crossing. The second truck was not damaged in the incident. Pakistan had closed off the crossing after U.S. helicopter strikes across the border killed two Pakistani soldiers. But it was reopened Sunday. It is the main land route for NATO supplies crossing from Pakistan to Afghanistan. Convoys have repeatedly come under militant fire in recent days. Since October 1, at least six people have been killed in attacks on supply vehicles -- in addition to the latest casualties. The convoys are generally operated by contracted Pakistani firms, using Pakistani trucks and drivers. The Pakistani Taliban has claimed responsibility for some of the attack, saying they were in retaliation for drone strikes. The group said it has set up a special squad to hit U.S. interests in Pakistan, especially NATO supply efforts. The latest suspected drone strike came Friday when four alleged militants were killed in North Waziristan, two Pakistani intelligence officials said. Two missiles hit a vehicle in the area of Machi Khel in the district -- one of seven in Pakistan's volatile tribal region bordering Afghanistan. The intelligence officials asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the media.","NEW: Drone strike kills 4 in tribal region .

"(CNN) -- A man ""angered"" by Manchester United's defeat to Barcelona in the final of the Champions League killed four people when he drove a minibus into a crowd celebrating the Spanish side's victory, police in Nigeria have told CNN. Barcelona fans celebrate in the city's Las Ramblas thoroughfare early Thursday morning. Ten people were also injured in the incident in the town of Ogbo, where the driver was subsequently arrested, a Port Harcourt Police spokesperson said. ""He was displaying his anger at his team losing the match. The driver had passed the crowd then made a U-turn and ran into them,"" spokesperson Rita Inomey-Abbey said. Both Manchester United and Barcelona have a large fan base across the African continent, with millions tuning in to watch European football on a weekly basis. Meanwhile, more than 100 people were arrested in Barcelona city center in the early hours of Thursday morning following the Catalan team's 2-0 victory in Rome in the final of Europe's top club competition. Police arrested 119 young people after violence flared at a special celebration party in Place de Catalunya near the Las Ramblas thoroughfare, while 238 people suffered minor injuries. City officials estimated the damage at up to 100,000 euros ($140,000) as the youths attacked police with bottles and damaged shops, parks and public utilities such as lamp-posts. The trouble took some of the gloss off the achievement of Barcelona, who became the first team to win the Champions League, Spanish League and Spanish Cup titles in one season. Manager Josep Guardiola led the club to glory in his first season in charge, ending a period of three years without a trophy.","Man drives minibus into a crowd celebrating Barcelona's Champions League win .

"CNN -- Ajax midfielder Evander Sno has suffered a heart attack whilst playing in a reserve match against Vitesse Arnhem on Monday. A statement on the club's website said the 23-year-old Dutch midfielder had to be resuscitated before later being transferred to hospital, where he is expected to stay for two weeks. The incident occurred after 60 minutes with Sno, who came on as a half-time substitute, having to be resuscitated three times. As a result of the former Celtic player's trauma the match was abandoned and he was treated on the pitch for more than ten minutes before regaining consciousness. Sno has played in for Bristol City in England, following earlier spells with NAC Breda and Feyenoord.

"Washington (CNN) -- Pick up a television remote control in your Las Vegas, Nevada, hotel room today and you are guaranteed to find a program to teach you how to play craps, blackjack and roulette as well as be inundated with 30-second messages about who to vote for in the Nov. 2 election. Wait, who to vote for? That's correct. The television airwaves in Las Vegas are so saturated with political TV commercials that in the past week alone, these ads took up 180,600 seconds or 3,010 minutes, according to a new analysis of TV ads for CNN by Campaign Media Analysis Group. To boil it down into a more recognizable number, more than 50 hours was dedicated to TV commercials on Las Vegas stations in the last seven days, said Evan Tracey, CMAG's president and CNN's consultant on TV advertising. An astonishing figure, yes, but when you pause it suddenly makes sense. After all, the battle for control of Congress is being waged in this Western state where Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is fighting for his political life and Republicans have a very good shot of defeating a Democratic incumbent in its march to try and retake the House majority. Add in the race for governor and other state offices and the airwaves quickly become cluttered with political TV commercials. And Tracey noted that seven in 10 commercials currently running on Las Vegas airwaves are negative. What is happening in Las Vegas is playing out in cities across the country such as Portland, Oregon; Orlando and Tampa, Florida; Denver, Colorado; Cleveland, Ohio; and Sacramento and Los Angeles, California. These are all media markets where more than 5,000 political ads ran on TV stations in the past week. ""This is crunch time for politicians as they start to try and reach the all important independent and late deciding voters who will determine the outcomes of close races,"" Tracey said. ""Even though most voters are locked in for one candidate there are still a significant percentage of people just tuning in and deciding who to vote for."" But does this saturation help? Won't voters turn off and tune out? Maybe so, but you still have to have skin in the game. ""Even though there is tremendous waste in this on return for investment, it is right now influencing the undecided voters who will decide these close elections,"" Tracey contended. ""Politics is still the only business that spends the most amount of money and has the least amount of people to influence."" A snapshot of all television advertising in the past week shows that $40 million was spent on Senate races, while more than $46.6 million was dedicated to House races. In the Senate, Republicans spent about $4 million more than Democrats, thanks to ads run by outside interest groups. Meanwhile, the GOP spent more than $2 million more than Democrats in the battle for the House, also due to spending by outside groups. Now, to really give you an even bigger mind-boggling figure: $182 million was spent on television ads for federal, local and state races combined in the past week. This was a 17 percent increase from the prior week. And if that doesn't surprise you, check this out: Tracey predicts that by year's end -- the final spending figure for all political and issue TV advertising in the 2010 midterm elections will exceed $3 billion. Just in time for the start of the 2012 presidential race. Remember, the first commercial of the 2008 presidential contest was aired in December 2006 by then-Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-California.","Fifty hours dedicated to political TV commercials on Las Vegas stations in last seven days .

"New York (CNN) -- A girl taken to a clinic for a skin rash had to be treated with a drug cocktail to prevent HIV and hepatitis after she was accidentally pricked by contaminated needles on the floor, according to the attorney for the family. Hailey Rodriguez, who turned 3 on Monday, is sick from the side effects of the drug cocktail she was given by Montefiore Medical Center after the ordeal, Susan Karten, Maklad's attorney told CNN. Nadia Maklad took her daughter to the Montefiore Medical Pavilion in the Bronx on October 7 because Hailey had a minor skin rash. Maklad was talking to the doctor in the examination room when she heard her daughter screaming and crying. ""I asked her what happened. She lifted up her dress, her stomach was bleeding and her hand was bleeding. She pointed to a bin: it was a red bio hazard bin on the floor,"" Maklad told CNN. ""The top wasn't securely on, the opening where you put the needles was broken, the bin was full of uncapped dirty needles."" Steve Osborne, a spokesman for Montefiore, told CNN, ""We've been consulting with the family regarding the incident, and working with them to see that appropriate care is provided."" ""How this could happen at an institution like Montefiore is beyond me,"" Susan Karten, Maklad's attorney told CNN.

"Washington (CNN) -- A computer hacker responsible for creating and operating a massive scam that infected as many as 12 million computers worldwide has been identified and arrested, authorities said Wednesday. The FBI said in a news statement a 23-year-old Slovene known as ""Iserdo"" was arrested last week for his role in a cyber scam that stole passwords from websites and financial institutions. Authorities believe the Slovenian citizen is responsible for creating and selling the Mariposa botnet. Botnets are a network of computers infected with a malicious kind of robot software which allow remote access, often without the owner's knowledge. Police suspect this particular botnet was built with a computer virus known as the ""Butterfly Bot,"" the news statement said. It was designed to steal computer users' credit card and bank information, launch a denial of service attacks and spread viruses. ""In the last two years, the software used to create the Mariposa botnet was sold to hundreds of other criminals, making it one of the most notorious in the world,"" said FBI Director Robert Mueller. ""These cyber intrusions, thefts and frauds undermine the integrity of the Internet and the businesses that rely on it; they also threaten the privacy and pocketbooks of all who use the Internet."" The significant arrest comes about five months after Spanish authorities arrested three suspected Mariposa botnet operators. These individuals are being prosecuted in Spain, the FBI said.

"(CNN) -- An oil pipeline that on September 9 began leaking crude oil just southwest of Chicago, Illinois, was back up and running Friday morning, owner Enbridge Energy Partners LP announced. The line, 6A, runs from Superior, Wisconsin, to Griffith, Indiana, and transports 670,000 barrels per day, according to Enbridge. The company this summer has had to close three pipelines to investigate and/or make repairs. The first and largest was a rupture in line 6B that dumped more than 800,000 gallons into Michigan's Kalamazoo River. The company also shut down a pipeline this Monday after oil was detected near a construction site, but the company noted this incident did not appear to be a leak as the investigation stemmed from the discovery of less than a gallon of oil. Spills spark spikes in gasoline prices . Large or small, pipeline incidents have been grabbing headlines, not to mention the eyes of politicians. And since there's about 200,000 miles of liquid pipeline and 300,000 of gas lines, it's an issue than can affect just about every part of the country. The recent liquid pipeline failures in combination with the deadly gas pipeline explosion and fire that killed four people in San Bruno, California, helped lead to a Wednesday hearing of the U.S. House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, where politicians voiced concerns over the industry's regulatory standards. More questions surround California gas line . ""This is a very timely hearing, as we are unfortunately experiencing a high level of pipeline accidents that have caused significant death and destruction,"" said Rep. Corrine Brown, D-Florida, chair of the Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials. ""Our subcommittee ... has found significant problems with reporting and inspections,"" she said. Enbridge has taken significant heat over the notion that it waited too long to report the incident. ""The spill likely occurred sometime the day before Enbridge reported it to the National Response Center,"" said Rep. Jim Oberstar, D-Minnesota, chair of the committee. He noted that in a hearing prior to the spill in Michigan, Enbridge's vice president of U.S. operations touted his company's ability to detect problems in the pipes. Oberstar cited Adam's quote from the previous hearing: ""Our response time from our control center can be almost instantaneous, and our large leaks are typically detected by our control center personnel."" The pipe ruptured 10 days after he made that statement. ""Enbridge knew about hundreds of defects in the line,"" Oberstar added, ""and we know that PHMSA [the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration] was made aware of them and failed to do anything to address Enbridge's inaction. That is not a culture of safety."" Denise Green, who testified at the hearing, wept as she described how she and her two daughters had been exposed to benzene, a volatile carcinogen, after the spill. ""My 12-year-old asks me frequently, 'Am I going to get cancer?'"" said Green during her testimony. ""The only way I can answer that is 'I don't know. The only thing we can do is pray that everything will be OK.'"" Residents near spill urged to evacuate . In his prepared testimony, Enbridge President and CEO Patrick Daniel said he was ""deeply concerned"" by the Michigan incident and that ""for Enbridge, no spill is acceptable."" The Detroit Free Press reported this week that the pipe that broke in Michigan had been marked for defects three times in the past five years but that, since those defects were declared to be minor, no repairs were required under current federal regulations. So, would more stringent rules make things any better? Perhaps, said leading industry analyst Richard Kuprewicz, but he said care should be taken not to enact rules simply as a means of punishment. ""We just want to be sure that those improvements are effective. We don't just want regulation for the sake of regulation,"" he said. Overall Kuprewicz said he feels gas pipelines need the most overhaul, for a combination of reasons. Part of it, he said, is because gas can do so much damage when it ignites. ""The gas guys have got to really come to the table and start saying, 'We've got an issue here. We've got to have more rational regulation.'"" Nonetheless, the majority of the hearing this week centered on liquid pipelines, which, Kuprewicz said, can certainly use ""incremental"" changes. He said he would see it as ""overkill"" to force companies to repair every problem. ""You can't eliminate all anomalies in a pipeline,"" he added. ""All pipelines corrode. The question is, does the operator have that corrosion under control so the pipeline doesn't go to failure?"" Kuprewicz also added that while it may seem like the companies should be able to more quickly identify an issue, it's not always so cut and dry. ""I've been in the control room operating this stuff. It's hard to find major releases, even ruptures, by pressure loss. There's so much information coming into these control rooms, so it isn't as easy as the public thinks it is."" He then added that he is by no means defending Enbridge over its response time in the Michigan spill. He concluded by saying the industry has taken a ""quantum leap"" forward over the years but ""it needs to continually progress because obviously we're getting these ruptures and it's not good.""

"(CNN)  -- Germany's Martin Kaymer beat Bubba Watson after a three-hole playoff to win the 92nd PGA Championship at Whistling Straits and claim his first major title. Dustin Johnson should have joined Kaymer and fellow American Watson in the playoff but was controversially penalized two-shots for an infringement on the final hole in regulation play. Johnson initially finished on 11-under 277 but was ruled to have grounded his club in a bunker before playing his second shot to the 18th green and his five became a triple bogey seven, putting him back to nine-under. Watson initially made the running in the playoff as he made a birdie at the first extra hole, but Kaymer hit back with a birdie of his own on the next. The 18th proved the decider and Watson found the water with his approach to the green and could only make a double bogey. Kaymer was also in trouble, but made a two-foot bogey putt to clinch victory after a dramatic final day in Wisconsin. ""I hope it is one of many majors I win in my career. It's spectacular,"" the 25-year-old told gathered reporters. Long recognized as a star of the future, Kaymer becomes the second German after Bernhard Langer to win a golfing major. He is also the third first-time major winner this season after U.S. Open winner Graeme McDowell of Northern Ireland and British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen of South Africa. Phil Mickelson, who won the first of the season at the U.S. Masters made a last day charge, but his five-under 67 left him in a tie for 12th. It means Tiger Woods remains as world number one, but he finished well off the pace after a fine round one-over 73, still searching for the first win of his truncated season. Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy and another American Zach Johnson shared third, both having their chances to claim victory, but missing the playoff by one shot. Overnight leader Nick Watney lost his three shot lead on the first hole and carded a sorry nine-under 81 to slip into a tie for 17th. But it was hard not to feel sorry for Johnson, who had blown a three-shot final round lead at the U.S. Open in search of his first major title. A superb birdie two on the short 17th had left him needing a par four on the final hole to emerge on top after a fluctuating final day. But his tee shot found a sandy lie in an area trampled by spectators, one of many such areas at Whistling Straits. Johnson did not believe it constituted a regular bunker and illegally placed his club face on the ground before making his shot. After he finished his round with a bogey five, officials examined television footage of the incident and handed down the penalty. ""It never crossed my mind I was in a sandtrap,"" said Johnson. ""That was one situation where I should have looked at the rule sheet a little harder."" Whistling Straits, which has the look of a seaside links course, has nearly 1,000 sanded areas and under local rules all of them are designated as bunkers. Johnson finished in a tie for fifth with compatriot Jason Dufner and Australian Steve Elkington. China's Liang Wen-chong, who set the course record with a 64 on Saturday, shot a final round one-over 73 and finished in a tie for eighth.","Germany's Martin Kaymer claims 92nd PGA Championship at Whistling Straits .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Britney Spears accused a former bodyguard of trying to ""make a name for himself"" by suing her for sexual harassment. Fernando Flores, who worked for the pop star earlier this year, filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Wednesday claiming Spears intentionally inflicted emotional distress on him. The lawsuit claims Spears made ""repeated unwanted sexual advances"" on Flores, had ""vigorous"" sex in front of him and near her two children and violently argued with her boyfriend. A statement posted on Spears' website said the suit was ""another unfortunate situation where someone is trying to take advantage of the Spears family and make a name for himself."" Spears said the California Department of Children and Family Services already investigated the accusations and closed the case without any action. ""Ms. Spears and her attorneys have every expectation that this matter will be dismissed by the courts,"" her statement said . The filing said the harassment began after Flores was hired as a guard at her Calabasas, California home last February by Advanced Security Concepts Corporation. Spears made ""repeated unwanted sexual advances to Plaintiff, summoning Plaintiff to her room at her residence for no other purpose or reason that to expose her naked or near naked body to Plaintiff,"" the suit claimed. Flores was ""shocked and disgusted by the incident,"" it said. When he reported it to his supervisor, Flores was told ""You know you liked it,"" and his complaints were ""ignored or mocked,"" it said. Spears allegedly ""engaged in numerous sex acts in front of Plaintiff, including but not limited to sexual intercourse."" The suit detailed an alleged incident at a California hotel where Flores heard Spears ""loudly having sexual relations while her two children were in the suite with her."" Flores claimed he saw Spears ""having vigorous sexual relations"" when he entered her home on two occasions. He also said he witnessed ""violent quarrels with her boyfriend"" while her children present.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- With strong sales and equally powerful praise, the July issue of Italian Vogue can be judged a resounding success. Chanel Iman is one of several models of color featured in the ""Black Issue"" of Italian Vogue. Dubbed the ""Black Issue,"" the magazine celebrates models of color from the past and present, including Donyale Luna, Liya Kebede, Naomi Campbell, Iman and Chanel Iman. Within 72 hours, the magazine sold out in the United States and Great Britain. Blog posts and e-mails about the beauty and historical significance of the issue began to flow -- and industry insiders were equally pleased. Praising renowned photographer Steven Meisel, who shot most of the issue's fashion pictures, The New York Times fashion critic Cathy Horyn gushed, ""I think they are some of the best he's done. ... They are crazily, softly beautiful, plainly the work of someone who knows women and fashion.""  See what all the fuss is about » . Another 40,000 copies of the ""Black Issue"" were recently reprinted to meet the still strong demand. But will the all the hoopla translate into tangible change for black models in the fashion industry? Will more color be seen on the runway and in magazines? Many observers have their fingers crossed. ""All the agents were happy about the issue because it gives us hope that other people will catch on and decide that it's OK to use more black girls,"" said Carlos Ojeda, an agent at New York Models. ""It's OK to have more than just one, and she doesn't have to always be Naomi."" ""Italian Vogue is very influential around the world on an artistic level,"" said Constance White, style director at eBay. ""That is the book that all the art directors, the photographers, any fashion editor looking for inspiration turns to ... and always has. It has always been the trendsetter, so hopefully people will look at it and say using black models is both relevant and right and will start doing it too."" Bethann Hardison, a legendary model agent-manager, said she has noticed a shift in the industry since she began holding town hall meetings last September to address the lack of diversity in fashion. The packed-to-the-rafters events quickly became the talk of the industry, and Hardison is widely credited with sparking the current movement. ""I started seeing more black models on the runway back in February,"" she said, pointing to the shows of designers like Diane Von Furstenberg and Michael Kors as examples. ""I have already seen change, and I know that I will continue to see change."" Not all are nearly as optimistic, and fear the diversity issue will become as passe as the skinny-model debate of a few years ago. ""I hate to sound cynical, but by January, I feel like it will be back to business as usual,"" Ojeda said. ""I want to be hopeful and positive, but a part of me does not want to get my hopes up."" ""Let's see if Italian Vogue is going to be able to live up to the standards that they've now set,"" added one prominent New York-based stylist. ""You can't have an issue with all black girls, pat yourself on the back and say 'that's it for the year.' "" Hardison is working hard to make sure that doesn't happen. She's already scheduled another town hall meeting for September, and she's also planning a mixer to introduce fledgling models of color to industry players. ""We just have to keep the bar high,"" Hardison said, ""and keep showing beautiful women and pictures.""

"(CNN)  -- Five years ago this month, Katrina hit New Orleans. What it created is a tale of two cities, the haves vs. the have-nots. Enormous progress in the city's Business District overshadows the lingering blight in the 9th Ward and St. Bernard Parish, where folks are still struggling to rebuild and many lots remain empty. Unfortunately, Katrina attacked the two poorest states in America, Mississippi and Louisiana. It destroyed or disrupted the economic engines of both states: their tourism, shipbuilding, fisheries, port operations industries and petroleum production in the Gulf. Katrina left about 1,836 people dead, destroyed about 275,000 homes in Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana, and cost the federal government about $114 billion. But there is good news. Post-Katrina tax incentives have had a dramatic impact. The region has more hotels and restaurants than it had before the hurricane, and its major infrastructure -- sewer, water, public service buildings, police and fire departments, National Guard -- has new or rebuilt buildings. Federal money has transformed the schools in New Orleans, reorganizing them into charter schools, which are a far cry from pre-Katrina's dysfunctional schools operating in dilapidated buildings. Public health in New Orleans before Katrina meant treatment in run-down, understaffed public hospitals. Chief of those was Charity Hospital, known as ""Big Charity,"" the state-run teaching hospital for Louisiana State University Medical School. But it is no more. The Veterans Hospital, next to Big Charity, was also destroyed during Katrina. Afterward, much discussion revolved around whether to repair or replace Big Charity. The Federal Emergency Management Agency insisted on providing only repair money versus money to replace Charity with a hospital that could share a campus with a new Veterans Hospital. It took four years to get a FEMA decision on helping to pay for replacing Charity, yet during this period of indecision, the city and state public health systems built community-based clinics. This is a 21st-century medical system far superior to pre-Katrina hospital-based public health. New Orleans' levee and water control systems have been steadily improved by upgrading pumps with backup generators. Gates have been installed at critical canals to help block water from entering the city during storm surges. About 325 miles of levees are around the city and surrounding parish, and work on the levees continues. But seemingly intractable problems that affect the poorest residents still beset the city. Two years ago, during Hurricane Gustav, water was splashing over the levee protecting the 9th Ward, the neighborhood most devastated by Katrina. Gustav reminded us the city remains vulnerable to levee failure -- any levee is no match for nature. The enduring erosion of the coastline, caused by bad water management all the way from the upper Mississippi River and the coastal canals, erodes the marshes and leaves coastal Louisiana exposed to the full brunt of future hurricanes. Public safety and housing remain the most difficult issues. Crime is a major problem in the Big Easy, and the police department is under enormous strain. Several groups of New Orleans Police Department employees are under federal investigation, accused of abuse of power --  including murder charges. Today, in these tough economic times, police officers are being asked to accept a 10 percent pay cut. Most officers cannot take their police cars home without paying for that privilege. Public safety has a long way to go. Also, more bad than good has been said of Louisiana's ""Road Home"" program, designed to help displaced residents get back into their houses. The shining star of home rebuilding, instead, is the enormous amount of volunteers who work tirelessly to help poor folks get back into their homes. Many middle-class neighborhoods still include blighted houses. The only option for the owners, who don't have the cash to rebuild, is to tear them down. The 9th and 7th Wards and St. Bernard Parish have the worst problems. Many people remain frustrated with the ""Road Home"" program. Although some got enough money to rebuild, most complain that the amount of provided by insurance and FEMA falls far short of actual repair costs. FEMA used pre-Katrina values to determine repair costs, but the costs of building materials and labor were a lot higher after the hurricane. New Orleans also had one of the highest number of renters in the country, at about 37 percent of residents. Initially, FEMA did not provide funding to rebuild rented housing. The slow economy that followed Katrina put limits on the amount of cash for building affordable housing. Most of the city's public housing projects were demolished. The city and private companies are building mixed-use public housing, but most of the poor people I speak with are suspicious of the effort. The Business District is in better shape than ever, but the legacy of Katrina's destruction lives on in the poorer neighborhoods of the 9th Ward and St. Bernard Parish. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Russel L. Honoré.","Russel Honoré: Post-Katrina New Orleans is a tale of two cities, haves vs. have nots .

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. officials are revising the way they screen air passengers coming to the United States, dropping measures hastily implemented after the Christmas Day bombing attempt and replacing them with a plan to give airlines and other nations ""real-time, threat-based intelligence"" about potential terrorists. Under the plan, the Transportation Security Administration would give airlines and other nations information gleaned from intelligence sources about potential terrorists -- information such as partial names, partial passport numbers and travel patterns of suspects. The plan retains existing No Fly and selectee lists, as well as the random selection of some passengers for additional screening. But the plan scuttles a much-criticized program, implemented in the wake of the December 25 bombing attempt, that subjected virtually all travelers from 14 predominantly Muslim countries to additional screening. ""What we have done is changed the way we screen passengers who are coming internationally into the United States,"" said Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano. ""It is a more intel- or information-based way to screen. It's a stronger way to determine whether passengers should go through secondary examination and not just primary examination."" The new security measures are the result of a review President Obama ordered after a Nigerian man allegedly tried to blow up a Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam, Netherlands, to Detroit, Michigan, on Christmas Day. The measures begin Friday but will take a short time to implement fully, a senior administration official said. The U.S. intelligence community will determine, based on threat information, which characteristics should be used to select passengers for secondary screening. Race could be one distinguishing feature passed along, but ""only when we have reliable intelligence that suggests that someone with that characteristic is a potential terrorist,"" said the administration official. The official said the program did not involve racial profiling. The air carriers and international countries -- when they are the ones administering screening -- will have responsibility for pulling and screening passengers who meet the criteria. The official said there is no concern about providing too much intelligence to too many people. Security partners will be given what they need to identify people for additional screening and no more. The new security regime requires cooperation from the airlines and other governments, but the official does not anticipate compliance problems. ""It is in their interest to ensure the safety of their flights,"" the official said. The United States will do inspections, and there will be penalties for not complying. The recent case of David Headley showed how ""fragmentary intelligence"" can be used to help stop a potential terrorist, two administration officials said. In March, Headley pleaded guilty to helping plan the November 2008 Mumbai, India, terror attacks, and another attack that was never carried out on a Danish newspaper that published controversial cartoons about the prophet Mohammed. Based on intelligence, including a partial name and travel information, Customs and Border Protection did additional screening of travelers entering the United States and was able to identify Headley. Since the failed Christmas Day attack, Napolitano has participated in aviation summits in Spain, Mexico, Japan and other places to forge agreements and to strengthen ways information can be shared around the aviation community, a senior administration official said. Napolitano has suggested the International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency, set standards that would apply to all international airports, strengthening weak links in the security chain. European privacy laws have stymied previous U.S. efforts to gain access to passenger information. Full-body scanners improve security, TSA says . ""I believe that this is a more effective security strategy,"" said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, ranking member of the Senate Homeland Security Committee. ""Applying a kind of blanket, 'one-size-fits-all' scrutiny to individuals based solely on their country of origin provides only limited additional security and helps terrorists avoid detection by using operatives from other countries to carry out their plots."" Rep. Peter King, R-New York, ranking member of the House Homeland Security Committee, called the change a ""significant step forward"" but criticized the White House for not briefing Congress before announcing the change. ""This is yet another instance of homeland security adviser John Brennan and other White House staff withholding important security information from Congress,"" he said. The Sikh Coalition, a religious rights organization, also said it welcomed the change, highlighting the decision to end the ""14 country"" directive. ""Because the policy focused solely on national origin and not individual behavior, it effectively made profiling the law of the United States,"" the group said. ""Its rescission is a step in the right direction towards ending profiling by the federal government.""

"(CNN) -- More than two-thirds of the passengers survived an airplane crash Monday morning in southeastern Venezuela, government officials said. Fifteen people were confirmed dead and 36 survived when the plane, carrying 51 passengers and crew, crashed in the state of Bolivar, Gov. Francisco Rangel Gomez said. Many of the survivors were taken to hospitals in the city of Guayana, he said. At least two of the victims died at the hospital, said Yanitza Rodriguez, director of the Hospital Uyapar. Rangel Gomez declared three days of mourning but called it a ""miracle"" that so many people survived. The survivors ""are with some problems, but they are alive, thank God,"" he said. Authorities had identified all but six of the deceased. A names of the victims would be withheld until they are all identified, Rangel Gomez said. The aircraft belongs to the government-owned Conviasa airline. Aerial photographs showed that the plane crashed in an industrial storage yard. Best Western hotel clerk Ivan Maradey said he saw the plane tumble into some power lines before hitting the ground and exploding. The aircraft was an ATR42, a twin-turboprop, short-haul airplane built in France and Italy, Rangel Gomez said. Conviasa Flight 2350 was en route from Isla Margarita to Guayana when it crashed, the governor said. The cause of the crash had not been determined and remained under investigation, Rangel Gomez said. He identified the pilot as Ramiro Cardenas. The officials made their comments on the CNN-affiliated Globovision TV station. Federal investigators arrived at the scene Monday afternoon to begin examining the crash site, the state-run AVN news agency reported.","Fifteen people confirmed dead, governor says .

"Washington (CNN) -- The government will provide $680 million in compensation to settle a class-action lawsuit by Native American farmers against the U.S. Department of Agriculture, according to a proposed agreement announced Tuesday. Under the agreement, which requires federal court approval, Native Americans can file claims for discrimination involving farm loans that occurred in the period from 1981-1999, said statements by Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Attorney General Eric Holder. ""Today's settlement can never undo wrongs that Native Americans may have experienced in past decades, but combined with the actions we at USDA are taking to address such wrongs, the settlement will provide some measure of relief to those alleging discrimination,"" Vilsack said in his statement. The $680 million will compensate eligible members of the class-action suits with valid claims, the statements said. The agreement has two payment tracks -- one provides $50,000 to those who provide substantial evidence of discrimination to an impartial adjudicator, and the other pays up to $250,000 to those who can show economic losses caused by discrimination. ""Actual monetary awards are subject to reduction based on the amount of available funding and the number of meritorious claims,"" the statements said. The settlement also includes $80 million for debt relief, as well as other assistance for Native American farmers. In a White House statement, President Barack Obama called the agreement ""an important step forward in remedying USDA's unfortunate civil rights history."" The lawsuit alleged discrimination against Native Americans regarding their access to and participation in the Agriculture Department's farm loan programs, according to the statement. ""This settlement marks a major turning point in the important relationship between Native Americans, our nation's first farmers and ranchers, and the USDA,"" said a statement by Joseph M. Sellers, the lead plaintiffs' attorney. ""After three decades, Native American farmers and ranchers will receive the justice they deserve, and the USDA has committed to improving the farm loan system in ways that will aid Native Americans for generations to come."" George and Marilyn Keepseagle, whose name is on the lawsuit against the government, said they were unfairly denied operating loans and had to sell portions of their sprawling farm on the Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota. ""This is a great day for us, not only for us but our people,"" Marilyn Keepseagle said. ""It's been a long time brewing and finally today it came to a positive end. And I'm happy about that."" She said she wants to use some of the money to pay off bills and to make much needed repairs to their home of 40 years. Claryca Mandan of the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation, who is a member of the lawsuit, said she was unfairly denied farms loans in the past. Mandan and her husband still reside on land that was allocated by the Dawes General Allotment Act of 1887, which intended to settle Native American tribes and turn them into farmers and ranchers. ""It definitely was long, and it definitely was worth it, to voice some measure of justice for our community,"" Mandan said of the settlement. ""It's always a rare day and one we rejoice in. We are very happy to be put back on equal footing again with the rest of America."" The settlement also calls for future changes to the USDA's farm loan program. It will create the Native American Farmer and Rancher Council, a new federal advisory committee, which lawyers said will bring together Native American and USDA officials to discuss the USDA's programs. ""I think the leadership in the USDA genuinely wants to see them succeed,"" Sellers said, adding that it will take time to implement the changes. ""But we have the mechanism that will begin the process of delivering these services to Native Americans so [with] the next generation of farmers, the USDA will be a better partner than it has in the past."" He praised the leadership of Marilyn Keepseagle and Claryca Mandan and others, saying their perseverance showed such a case could succeed. ""This illustrates the power of the individuals,"" Sellers said, adding they had ""pursued this with great courage and determination, and it's a great tribute to them and others like them who may want to take on a mission like this."" The agreement follows a similar settlement in February on behalf of African-American farmers against the USDA, known as Pigford II. However, that settlement depends on congressional appropriation of the necessary funds, which hasn't happened. Obama's statement called on Congress to authorize the more than $1 billion in funding for the Pigford settlement. Payment to the Native American farmers will come from the Judgment Fund maintained by the Department of Justice. The fund was established to provide monetary awards for court judgments and settlements against the government, and therefore needs no separate congressional authorization for the Native American farmers settlement. According to the 2007 Census of Agriculture, there are about 60,000 Native American farmers in the United States -- double the number of African-American farmers.","Plaintiffs say the long wait was worth it .

"London, England (CNN) -- The 48th season of the Bundesliga will commence this week with champions Bayern Munich looking to defend their title against Steve McClaren's Wolfsburg. So what's new? After Die Mannschaft's exhilarating performances at the World Cup, the profile of German football is higher than ever before. Star performers in South Africa, Werder Bremen's Mesut Ozil and Stuttgart's Sami Khedira may have been snapped up by Real Madrid but with the likes of Thomas Muller and Arjen Robben still at Bayern Munich and Spain legend Raul signing for Schalke, the race for the Bundesliga title could be the closest yet. Bayern Munich may have won all the baubles last term but their championship defense will be far from straightforward. The likes of Schalke, Wolfsburg, Werder Bremen, Hamburg and Bayer Leverkusen all stand a chance of snatching the crown from Bayern -- a club nicknamed 'FC Hollywood' because of its reputation for big-name stars and high-octane drama. Ballack and Ozil: Will recent fortunes be reversed? Surprisingly, however, the team that has made the transfer headlines this summer hasn't been the Bavarians but Schalke. Under the management of Felix Magath, the club secured the signature of Spain's record top scorer Raul as well as the injury-plagued but highly talented center-back Christoph Metzelder -- both from the Bernabeu. Magath isn't the only manager who's signed some 'new' old talent. Veteran German captain Michael Ballack has been lured from Chelsea to his alma mater Bayer Leverkusen by boss Jupp Heynckes. At the other end of the table, Kaiserslautern return to the Bundesliga for the first time in four years and eccentric outfit St Pauli are back in the top flight for the first time in eight. They replace Vfl Bochum and HSC Hertha and will be expected to battle for survival against Nurnberg, Koln, Hannnover and Mainz. Key players: All eyes will be on new boy Raul as he looks to make an impression on the Bundesliga. Initial signs look promising for the former Madrid captain as he scored a brace on his debut against Bayern in a 3-1 victory in the LIGA total! Cup final. Raul and Metzelder's arrival at Schalke combined with the return of Jermaine Jones from long-term injury could help Felix Magath close the gap (just five points last term) on title favourites Bayern. The big news for Bayern is their having retained the services of superstars Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery. Add to that the blossoming of World Cup golden boot winner Thomas Muller and the maturing Bastian Schweinsteiger means the champions will certainly prove a tough test. The challenge for Louis Van Gaal however will be to keep his stars fit. Although Ribery -- who suffered a nightmare last season because of recurring injuries -- looks set to be ready for the opening game, Robben has been ruled out of action for up to eight weeks with a torn muscle. Key clubs: Despite the dominance of Bayern Munich, three clubs have won the title in the last four years -- making the Bundesliga one of the most competitive in Europe. This season, Van Gaal's side will be considered favourites but Felix Magath, who won the championship twice with Bayern and once with Wolfsburg, will be looking to repeat that feat as Schalke coach. One outside bet for the title is Wolfsburg under new manager Steve McClaren. The former England boss had left the Three Lions under a cloud -- albeit beneath a nice big umbrella -- when they failed to qualify for Euro2008 but subsequent success with Dutch side FC Twente has seen his stock rise once again. If McClaren, the first Englishman to manage in the Bundesliga, can successfully retain his Bosnians: striker Edin Dzeko and midfielder Zvjezdan Misimovic, then the Wolves could mount a serious challenge this season. Expert view: CNN's Kate Giles - ""It always feels like a mistake to bet against Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga... and it might be more based on hope than conviction... but I think that in 2010 Bayern might just have to settle for second. ""I can't deny Bayern do have the best squad in all of the German league, plus a very experienced and capable coach in Louis Van Gaal. And yes, this is his second season in charge, so they probably won't have the same rocky start to this campaign as they did the last. They also go into the new season as reigning league and cup champions. ""So they're pretty much a safe bet. It's the Bundesliga. Bayern are always a safe bet. But -- and here's something I never thought I'd say -- I think Schalke have what it takes to beat them. ""They're a new force under Felix Magath. The coach proved how far he can take a pretty average side when he took Wolfsburg to the title in 2009. In his first season at Schalke he took them to second place. ""This season, he's brought in some much-needed experience to the side, not to mention goal-scoring prowess in the form of Raul. I admit there are big question marks. How quickly will Raul adapt? And will Schalke manage the added burden of the Champions League? However, I think they will have the heart to triumph over perennial champions Bayern, who might have misplaced confidence after last season's trophy haul. ""I can't say I have much confidence that any of the other sides can mount a challenge but there's a few worth keeping an eye on. I'm hoping to be impressed by Steve McLaren at Wolfsburg -- after the club managed to hold on to Grafite and Edin Dzeko. ""And Hamburg, Leverkusen and Stuttgart should be battling for the Champions League -- but they'll probably have to settle for a tier lower. Whilst Bremen saw their chances of challenging walk out the door with Mesut Ozil's exit to Real Madrid.""","Arjen Robben injury could hinder Bayern Munich's defence of Bundesliga.

"(CNN) -- CNN senior international correspondent Nic Robertson analyzes the fallout from the publication of tens of thousands of U.S. military and diplomatic reports about Afghanistan by whistleblower website WikiLeaks. Q: What do these documents tell us about the war in Afghanistan? A: It's more detail than we've ever seen before about the war. The newspapers -- the New York Times, the Guardian in the UK and others -- have had access to the documents for several weeks and have had the chance to do the most digging. What they've been able to do -- and this is just the tip of the iceberg because nobody has had time top go through all 92,000 of them -- is to make a comparison with some of these individual documents and then the information and reporting that came out in the subsequent days after those documents were filed. What they're able to show is that there is sometimes a discrepancy, or there is sometimes some very revealing information. So it's in those small details that you really see how the war is being played out. That's what WikiLeaks boss Julian Assange wants to do. He wants to put that out in the public domain. Q: So what have we learned that we didn't know before? A: I think what we're hearing here is what a lot of people have suspected about many situations. For instance, this allegation that the Pakistani intelligence service -- the Inter-Services Intelligence -- has been supporting the Taliban fighting U.S. troops in Afghanistan. We've known for a long time that Pakistan sees huge importance in having a government that supports it in Afghanistan. They fear India on the other side of the border and therefore they want a friendly government on the other side of the country. These are things that have been discussed before and that's the tone of what you are seeing. These are things that have been suspected; now you have some factual evidence about them. Q: Just how sensitive is this information? A: All of these documents that we're seeing at the moment are, at their most sensitive, ""secret,"" as opposed to ""top secret."" Some of them do say ""not for foreign eyes,"" so perhaps there is an indication there that they're not for coalition partners inside Afghanistan. So they're clearly very sensitive, but not at the most senior level. Q: How damaging are these documents to the U.S.-led war effort in Afghanistan? A: They're absolutely damaging, the military says, because it puts troops in harm's way, it gives away factual details about how troops operate; for instance, the fact U.S. troops know heat-seeking surface-to-air missiles are being used against them is something they didn't want to put in the Taliban's domain. They say the Taliban will use this against U.S. troops, they will look at all the analysis and they will use that to their advantage in the field; they will use these details of civilian casualties in their own propaganda. Of course, the people who are putting this out are saying: ""Look, if you're going to fight a war everyone really needs to know the details of what is happening."" We are learning here details of things that we haven't found out and wouldn't have been able to find out on the ground. It is revealing information and it is only when you can go through all of these documents that you can really fit it all together into a bigger analysis and really frame it, rather than just seeing this snapshot that we're getting so far.","Documents reveal unprecedented wealth of detail about Afghan war .

"(CNN) -- Mexico celebrates its bicentennial Wednesday, an event known as ""El Grito,"" the shout for independence first credited to a Catholic priest who demanded freedom from Spain. For many Mexicans today, though, it's a quiet shout of despair. The country is mired in a bloody drug war that has seen more than 28,000 people killed in less than four years. The economy has barely begun to rebound from the global downturn, which hit Mexico harder than most Latin American countries. Tourism, a major lifeblood for the nation, is drastically down because of the violence and a flu pandemic last year that began in Mexico. And oil revenues, long a rich sustenance for the nation's economy, also have suffered a major collapse. Despite government efforts to hold a vast celebration that one leading newspaper called part Disney and part infomercial, many Mexicans are just not feeling it. ""The climate in which we're living in this country does not lend itself to a real celebration,"" said Adrian Jesus Garrido Gomez, who owns a car rental company and chauffeur service in Villahermosa, the capital of southeastern Mexico's Tabasco state. Garrido sounds leery of the nearly $232 million (about 2.97 billion pesos) the government says it has spent on celebrations in Mexico City. The lavish events Wednesday night will feature a parade, fireworks and a show that has merited visits by five Latin American presidents and dignitaries from 50 nations. ""They are grabbing it as an effort to make us forget everything that is happening in the country,"" Garrido said. ""It's more of a distraction."" That distraction does not seem to be working. ""Mexico is downbeat,"" said Peter Hakim, president emeritus of the Inter-American Dialogue, a non-partisan policy institute in Washington. ""People are nervous about the future."" Andrew Selee, director of the Woodrow Wilson Center's Mexico Institute, sees Mexico at a crossroads. ""It's a time of soul-searching,"" he said Wednesday. It's also a time of anxiety for authorities, who want to make sure the festivities go off without any major incidents or violence from the nation's organized crime groups. A bombing at a Grito celebration two years ago in Michoacan state left eight dead and more than 100 wounded. More recently, narcotrafficking cartels have taken to setting off car bombs, an unprecedented event in the nation's drug wars. Authorities have dispatched more than 14,000 police and troops to the streets of Mexico City to guard the peace. More than 2 million people are expected to throng the streets of the central city to watch the parade. Mexico formally recognizes its independence day each September 16 -- Thursday -- but the major celebration traditionally begins the night before. Close to midnight, President Felipe Calderon will make the symbolic shout ""Viva Mexico"" in the city's Plaza de la Constitucion, better known as the Zocalo. It is one of the largest plazas in the world. The shout pays tribute to a priest who called for sparked Mexico's struggle for independence from Spain on Sept. 16, 1810. Other cities have canceled celebrations. Juarez, the most violent city in the country, is one of them. Celebrations also were canceled in Tabasco state. That's probably a good thing, Garrido said. ""You can't openly go out and celebrate,"" he said. Besides the security concerns, there's another reason Garrido does not feel like celebrating -- the economy. Rain and recent storms have washed over much of Villahermosa, damaging the tourist trade upon which the father of two young boys relies for his chauffeur and car rental business. ""The little that I make goes to pay bills,"" he said. Gone this year, he said, is the usual trip over the holiday to visit his wife's parents in nearby Veracruz. ""We're going to have to do it in a more simple way,"" he said. Despite the problems and the worries, Selee says Mexicans will rally around the flag this week. ""By tonight, people will celebrate,"" he said Wednesday morning. ""When people around the country shout, 'Viva Mexico,' they will come together with pride about Mexico."" But how long will that last? ""People will put aside their differences for 24 to 48 hours,"" Selee said. Some might say it's not much of a reprieve for a country celebrating 200 years since it first tried to gain independence.","The 200-year anniversary comes amid drug-war deaths and a slumping economy .
Some residents see lavish celebrations as an attempt to try to distract the population .
Analysts see Mexico as ""downbeat"" and ""nervous"""
"(CNN) -- FIFA have announced the seedings for Friday's 2010 World Cup finals draw in a statement on their official web site. Hosts South Africa take their place in Pot One with the seven top placed sides in the world rankings as of October, these being Brazil, Spain, Holland, current holders Italy, Germany, Argentina and England. A new formula to decide the seedings has been implemented for the first time which sees teams selected on rankings places alone, rather than basing the decisions on rankings and previous tournament performances. Under the previous formula France, who qualified in controversial fashion with a playoff victory over the Republic of Ireland, would have been seeded instead of Holland. Had November's rankings been used France could have been seeded instead of England, FIFA's general secretary Jerome Valcke told the British Press Association this would have been unfair. ""We made the decision last month that the October rankings would be used because they were fairer,"" said Valcke. ""Countries who had been involved in the play-offs would have had an unfair advantages because they would have played more games and that affects their rankings."" Portugal, semi-finalists in 2006, join France and the other European qualifiers in Pot Four. As always geographical criteria is taken into consideration with the draw, meaning each group will contain a maximum of two European teams but no two teams from the remaining confederations can be drawn together. Pots for Friday's World Cup draw: . Pot One (Seeds): South Africa, Brazil, Spain, Holland, Italy, Germany, Argentina, England. Pot Two (Asia, Oceania and North/Central America): Japan, South Korea, North Korea, Australia, New Zealand, USA, Mexico, Honduras.

"Manila, Philippines (CNN) -- As the bodies of eight tourists killed in a bus hijacking in the Philippines arrived in Hong Kong, China, on Wednesday, the Hong Kong government urged citizens not to take their grief and anger out on Filipinos despite ""the poor way"" the hijacking was handled by authorities. The Cathay Pacific flight, which also carried eight survivors and 19 relatives as well as dozens of officials, was greeted by a large crowd on its arrival at Hong Kong International Airport. In a somber ceremony, bagpipers played ""Amazing Grace"" as coffins were carried from the plane and wreaths laid upon them. Several people were helped down a flight of stairs from the plane; one man's hand and arm were bandaged. Chief Secretary Henry Tang received the arrivals and then told reporters his government would urge its Philippine counterpart to conduct an ""comprehensive, thorough, and impartial"" investigation. ""The truth is the best consolation for the victims and their families,"" he said. He added that Hong Kong is prepared to aid the Philippine authorities during the investigation. ""In order to facilitate a fair and thorough understanding of the incident, we believe it is imperative that the investigation report should at least cover a detailed account of the whole incident; and a detailed account of the causes of death and injuries,"" he said. Two of three remaining hospitalized victims had been expected to be released from Philippine hospitals in time for the flight, but it was not known if they were on the plane that landed in Hong Kong.  A third, more seriously injured tourist, remained in an intensive care unit in the Philippines. Hong Kong's Chief Executive, Donald Tsang,  was to lead a ceremony to raise the flag and lower it to half-staff on  Thursday, and a three-minute period of silence was scheduled for 8 a.m.,  according to the Hong Kong government. Citizens were urged to join the ceremony or pay tribute in other ways during that time. Meanwhile, residents in the Philippines observed a national day of mourning Wednesday in the aftermath of this week's bus hijacking in Manila. Hong Kong's Equal Opportunities Commission said in a statement it ""understands the strong feelings of Hong Kong people on the poor way that the crisis had been handled by the Philippine authorities."" ""The EOC urges all members of the community to stay calm and, in line with our good tradition of tolerance and understanding, refrain from shifting our anger towards an innocent group, particularly the Filipinos who are living and traveling in Hong Kong,"" the statement said. ""The people of Hong Kong have every reason to take pride in the racial harmony of this city, and we should guard against any action that may cause racial hatred or discord."" Former police officer Rolando Mendoza, who was apparently upset about having lost his job, took hostage a busload of tourists from Hong Kong on Monday. Witnesses said Mendoza was initially willing to cooperate, but he was shot dead by police after authorities say he became violent and started shooting hostages. Rodolfo Matibay, district director of Manila police, took responsibility for how the incident was handled, saying he ordered the police assault on the bus, according to Gen. Leocaldo Santiago, regional director of Manila police. He has been placed on administrative leave while the case is being investigated. Four men and four women were killed in the standoff.  One passenger was critically wounded and six others were hospitalized with less serious injuries. The gunman had previously released nine of the hostages, including a mother and her three children, a man with diabetes and two photographers. The bus driver escaped. Santiago said police killed none of  the hostages, though a ballistics investigation has yet to be completed. Philippine President Benigno Aquino ordered all flags at public institutions in the Philippines, its embassies and consulates around the world lowered to half-staff. In Hong Kong, flags also were lowered and traders at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange paused in silence. The Chinese territory, meanwhile, issued a black travel alert for the Philippines, advising residents to avoid all travel there. The government's Home Affairs Department has set up 18 condolence points around Hong Kong to allow people to mourn the victims and offer messages of sympathy. Tsang made an appearance at one of them on Tuesday to observe a minute of silence. A Facebook page also honors the victims. At the Hong Kong Management Association David Li Kwok Po College, students and faculty remembered Jessie Leung, 14, who was killed along with her father and sister.  Her brother remains in critical condition; her mother also survived the incident. ""Jessie was a helpful girl -- cheerful, lovely, a good academic,"" said Catherine Chan, the school's development manager. ""We hope her brother will recover soon."" In Manila, a makeshift shrine was erected in front of the bus, with flowers left for the victims. The deadly standoff unfolded live on television, which the gunman was able to watch on a monitor on the bus. Santiago blamed the live broadcasts for contributing to the violence as the standoff quickly deteriorated while police surrounded the vehicle. ""We do not want to pass sweeping judgment or make early conclusions except to say that our intention to peacefully end this hostage drama was spoiled when the hostage-taker suddenly exhibited violent behavior and began shooting the hostages,"" Philippine National Police Chief Director Gen. Jesus A. Verzosa said Tuesday in a statement. National police said officials noted ""some observations and defects during their close monitoring of the unfolding events."" The statement did not provide details. However, it listed poor handling of the hostage negotiations; inadequate capability, skills, equipment and planning of the assault team; improper crowd control; inadequate training and competence of the assault team leader; and noncompliance to media relations procedures in hostage situations. ""The investigation has got to find out, what was the turning point? What happened?"" said Richard Gordon, chairman of the Philippine National Red Cross. Gordon said survivors said the situation inside the bus changed dramatically toward the end of the 10-hour standoff. ""Apparently the man went berserk. He was telling everybody he was not going to harm [them]. ... He said that nobody's going to get harmed. He said that he was probably going to die, but not the hostages,"" he said. Santiago said that Mendoza's family members spoke with him early in the standoff and that he appeared ""very reasonable and very psychologically stable."" Mendoza was a decorated police officer, winning several accolades. But his career spiraled downward when he was dismissed a year ago for extortion, Manila Vice Mayor Ikso Moreno said, and he wanted his motion for reconsideration to be heard. Moreno said that Mendoza's brother was arrested during the standoff because he was ""guilty of conspiring with his brother"" and allegedly helped instigate the shooting. Gordon said the brother's arrest may have pushed the gunman over the edge. ""When he saw his brother getting accosted by the policemen, he went berserk and he started firing,"" he said.

"(Mashable)  -- Sony has announced that it will drop the price of the PSP Go portable gaming system from $249 to $199 just in time for the holiday rush. The price cut is already effective -- just check out any online retailer like Gamestop or Amazon and you'll see the device selling at its new price point. It's a welcome change, and it makes the device more competitive with the Nintendo DSi ($149) and the iPod touch ($229 -- $399). Given the capabilities of the device, $199 seems like the perfect price point. The PSP targets the core gamer market, which is willing to pay a little bit more for impressive graphics than it would get on the DSi. Still, neither device is as dynamic as the iPod touch. Sony boasts that the PSP has moved 61 million units since it debuted in 2004, but the various DS models have sold more than 140 million units in roughly the same time period. The iPod Touch has sold at least 45 million since its 2007 launch -- and that's not counting iPhones, which play the same games. © 2010 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- At least one tornado ripped through northeast Texas Sunday evening, destroying homes, turning over vehicles and knocking train cars off tracks, local authorities said. A tornado struck Rice Texas at 5:30 p.m., Navarro County Chief Deputy Mike Cox said. The twister destroyed three homes, damaged at least two more, turned over an 18-wheeler truck onto a passenger car and knocked cars from a freight train off their tracks, he said. It also caused extensive damage to Rice Elementary School. Four people were transported to the hospital with minor injuries, Cox said. In addition to ""significant damage"" from a tornado moving through Navarro County, witnesses have also spotted possible tornados in other parts of northeast Texas, the National Weather Service said. Betty Montgomery of the Lone Oak Fire Department said callers had reported a debris cloud and structural damage to homes, but authorities had not confirmed whether a tornado had touched down. At least one home in Lone Oak was destroyed, Red Cross spokeswoman Anita Foster said. Joey Romero, 24, said he and his girlfriend rode out the storm in the freezer of a Sonic restaurant at a service station in Rice. They were driving from Dallas to Houston when it started to hail, he said. ""We pulled over under some covering. Hail the size of golf balls started falling. Then, we saw hail the size of baseballs,"" he said. Someone screamed when they saw the tornado forming behind Sonic, he said. The wind roared and the station lost power. ""The first few seconds it was all sort of surreal. I couldn't really believe it was happening...We all walked back in the freezer. It was cold in there and there wasn't light and people were starting to cry,"" he said. The hail shattered car windows, Romero said. The second-year medical student at University of Texas, Houston, said he helped treat injuries. A police officer told him a truck and a car had flipped over on the highway. After several hours inside Sonic, Romero was on the road back to Houston late Sunday. ""Even now, we can see the storm off to the east of us. The sky is pitch black,"" he said. CNN's Jacqui Jeras, Catherine E. Shoichet and Jessica Jordan contributed to this report.","NEW: A tornado destroys homes and knocks train cars off their track .

"Hong Kong, China (CNN) -- Typhoon Megi cut a deadly path into Asia on Friday, triggering mudslides that killed seven people and trapped more than 400 others in automobiles in Taiwan, officials said. At least 23 people, including 19 passengers on a tour bus, remained missing Friday night, Taiwan's official Central News Agency reported. Rescuers were searching for the missing and providing food to other stranded tourists trapped in the mountainous region of northeastern Taiwan. Helicopters were able to evacuate about 70 people, China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported. The driver and a passenger of a second tour bus were also listed as missing Friday after their vehicle was buried by a landslide, CNA reported. Soldiers were deployed to rescue those trapped, including about 200 visitors from China, said Cai Min, a spokesman for Taiwan's National Disaster Prevention and Protection Commission. More than two dozen travelers had been rescued by late afternoon Friday, officials said. The rock slides happened mainly along the Suhua Highway, in northeast Taiwan, Cai said. Megi, which killed at least 11 people in the Philippines, is expected to reach the Asian continent in southern China early Saturday, according to the Hong Kong Observatory. On the streets of Hong Kong, there were no signs of the typhoon yet. ""Although it is difficult to predict Megi's exact track, the public should stay alert and attend to their personal safety. They should stay away from the shoreline, avoid unnecessary outdoor activities and ensure drains are not blocked,"" acting Secretary for Security Lai Tung-kwok said. As precautions, crews in Hong Kong were deployed to pile sandbags, inspect and trim trees and check drains. Temporary shelters were being opened, and myriad boats were moored. Megi may be the strongest typhoon to hit China this year, the state-run Xinhua news agency has said. In southern China, strong gales arrived ahead of Megi. Domestic and international flights have been cancelled, and ferry services have been suspended in Guangdong, Fujian and Hainan, state-run China Daily said. In Guangdong, crews have fanned out to inspect reservoirs, dikes and water-conservation projects, in an effort to prevent storm-related injuries and deaths. Nearly 130,000 fishing boats have been recalled in Fujian, Guangdong and Hainan provinces, and more than 150,000 people have fled for safety in Fujian, according to Xinhua. Officials have issued the highest of four warnings, bracing for possible devastation in coastal areas, Xinhua said. The warning allows local officials six hours to evacuate residents, close schools and airports, and recall vessels that are considered at risk. On Thursday in the Philippines, lawmakers placed the province of Pangasinan under a state of emergency, to help municipalities recover from Megi, which was known in the Philippines as Typhoon Juan. The typhoon affected an estimated 258,844 Filipinos, leaving thousands homeless. CNN's Helena Hong contributed to this report.","NEW: At least 23 people are missing, including 19 on a tour bus .

"(CNN) -- Attention, please! Did you know that you should not talk about ""fat"" this week. That includes phrases like: • Does this make my butt look big? • I look so bloated. • I'm still trying to lose weight after the baby. • You look big-boned in that swimsuit. This idea that ""friends don't let friends fat talk"" is part of the Fat Talk Free Week international campaign which encourages women to end fat talk. ""I believe all women deserve to feel good about themselves. We need to prevent negative body images and get away from this obsession over the thin ideal. We should focus on our health instead of our size and weight,"" says Stacy Nadeau, a former model for Dove soap's Campaign for Real Beauty. Nadeau is the official spokeswoman for Fat Talk Free Week. The fraternity Tri Delta and The Center for Living, Learning and Leading have teamed up with partners and sponsors to raise public awareness about the campaign. Nadeau is traveling to college campuses and promoting the end of fat talk. She has been busy this week, writing on the campaign's Facebook page  and participating in events like writing fat phrases on pieces of paper, then crumpling them up and tossing them in the air. Another activity is compiling a list of prominent women from history who did something significant that had nothing to do with their looks. ""I think this week is important for people to be aware of because it has unfortunately become a norm to bash our bodies and talk awful about ourselves. This week is a great week to encourage women to stop talking fat talk,"" Nadeau said. Since it began three years ago, Fat Talk Free Week has gained sponsors and partners like The Academy for Eating Disorders. And as the active participants increase, so has media attention. Rosie O'Donnell addressed the issues on Sirius Radio. ""For people who have been overweight for a long part of their life, it's part of the vernacular -- you always say, 'I look so fat,' or 'I'm so fat.' You berate yourself. It's just part of the culture,"" O'Donnell said. Twenty-five million Americans suffer from anorexia, bulimia and binge eating disorders, According to Jeff Cannon at the National Eating Disorders Association.  Ninety percent of those sufferers are women. Psychology Professor at Trinity University, Carolyn Becker, helped found the Reflections Body Image Program, through which Fat Talk Free Week runs. ""Fat talk causes an incredible amount of misery among women. Statistics show that body dissatisfaction leads to eating less fruits, vegetables and even exercise. So body dissatisfaction likely also contributes to the problems we have with weight gain,"" Becker said. ""It's like a car. Imagine you have one you hate. How do you treat it? Terribly. But when you have a car you love how do you treat it? Much better. When we hate our bodies we treat them badly. When we care about them we treat them with respect,"" Becker said. The research used to create Fat Talk Free Week is based on the understanding of psychological dissonance. ""We don't like it when our beliefs and actions don't match up,"" Becker explained. ""So by having people speak and act against this ideal thin female beauty we create an uncomfortable psychological state."" This is the third year the one-week public awareness program has been in effect and according to Tri Delta's Director of Education Initiatives, Sarah Williamson, the viral videos and social media's expansion has greatly increased knowledge of the campaign. One YouTube video from 2008 has been viewed by over 140,000 people. The footage reports, ""54 percent  of women would rather be hit by a truck than be fat"" and ""If mannequins were women they would be too thin to bear children.""","Don't use the ""F"" word on final days of ""Fat Talk Free Week""

"(CNN) -- Defending champions Chelsea marched five points clear at the top of the English Premier League on Saturday with a 2-0 victory that left Wolverhampton in the relegation zone. Carlo Ancelotti's team bounced back from last weekend's goalless draw at Aston Villa to put the onus on title rivals Manchester City, Arsenal and Manchester United. Arsenal travel to City on Sunday, while United face a potentially tricky clash with Stoke in the club's first match since England striker Wayne Rooney -- who is sidelined with injury -- made a surprise turnaround and decided to sign a new five-year contract after threatening to leave. Chelsea faced a Wolves team who had not won since the opening day of the season, but made hard work of the victory after taking the lead in the 23rd minute. Nicolas Anelka helped Yuri Zhirkov --  his fellow goalscorer in the midweek Champions League win over Spartak Moscow -- set up France winger Florent Malouda for the opener. The visitors belied their lowly league position and squandered several chances to equalize, coming closest when halftime substitute Stephen Hunt's header was cleared off the line by Michael Essien. Hunt was booed when he came on the pitch by the home fans, who have still not forgiven him for the collision that left Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech with a fractured skull four years ago. Salomon Kalou replaced Malouda with 18 minutes to play, and the Ivory Coast forward made it 2-0 on 81 when he finished off a series of passes involving him, Essien and Didier Drogba, who returned from injury to lead the attack. Tottenham Hotspur moved up to third place with a 1-1 home draw against Everton in Saturday's early kick-off, after Rafael van der Vaart's first-half strike equaled Leighton Baines' goal for the visitors. Defender Baines put David Moyes' men ahead at White Hart Lane in the 17th minute with a deftly-struck left-foot free-kick that sailed into the top right-hand corner from the edge of the area, but the advantage proved to be short-lived. Spurs, who made three changes to the side who lost 4-3 to Inter Milan in the Champions League in midweek, equalized three minutes later. Capitalizing on a defensive mix-up between Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard and Phil Neville from a deep cross, Van der Vaart celebrated his return from European suspension to slot home his fourth of the season on 19 minutes when the ball fell at his feet just yards from the goal line. Everton looked to have greater energy as the game progressed though Yakubu, who had managed well as Everton's only forward, was replaced with France striker Louis Saha after sustaining an injury. The move prompted Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp to shuffle his pack and introduce the presence of striker Roman Pavlyuchenko in place of speedy winger Aaron Lennon, as both sides gambled for the win. Promoted West Brom joined Tottenham on 15 points with a 2-1 victory at home to Fulham, moving up to fourth place ahead of Arsenal and Manchester United. Roberto Di Matteo's team, had to come from behind after Scott Carson could only push Zoltan Gera's ninth-minute effort onto  the post -- and the ball bounced back off the former England goalkeeper and into the net. But Congo midfielder Youssouf Mulumbu leveled eight minutes later after collecting Chris Brunt's throughball and beating keeper Mark Schwarzer. Striker Marc-Antoine Fortune made it 2-1 five minutes before halftime with a cool finish after winger Jerome Thomas cut the ball back from the byline. Fulham boss Mark Hughes brought on former England striker Andy Johnson for his first appearance since January, but his team could not equalize and have now not won away since the opening day in August. Sunderland moved up to seventh place after beating Aston Villa 1-0 to end a run of five successive draws, as Richard Dunne's first-half own-goal proved the difference between the teams. The Republic of Ireland defender could only divert French midfielder Steed Malbranque's 25th-minute cross into his own net, and Villa earlier saw winger Stewart Downing hit the post and striker Emile Heskey completely miskicked in front of goal in the second half. Sunderland have scored just 11 times in nine league matches -- seven from England striker Darren Bent, two from record signing Asamoah Gyan, and two own-goals. Bolton joined Sunderland on 12 points with a 1-1 draw at Wigan, who moved above Fulham into 14th place. Wigan took the lead just before the hour mark through Colombia striker Hugo Rodallega, but Sweden forward Johan Elmander leveled in the 66th minute. Birmingham moved up to 12th place with a 2-0 win over Blackpool, who also have 10 points along with Everton, Stoke and Wigan. Defender Liam Ridgewell scored Birmingham's first home goal since August 21 in the 36th minute, nodding in from close range after Nikola Zigic headed against the crossbar. The giant Serbia striker scored his second goal in successive matches 10 minutes after the halftime break when Blackpool could not clear Ridgewell's cross. Newcastle won 2-1 at bottom club West Ham in the late match to move above Villa on goal difference, with young striker Andy Carroll netting a 68th-minute winner for his fifth league goal this season. West Ham went ahead in the 12th minute through striker Carlton Cole's first of the campaign, but visiting captain Kevin Nolan leveled 10 minutes later.","Chelsea beat lowly Wolverhampton 2-0 to move five points clear of Manchester City .

"(CNN) -- The cold has cleared the sunbathing crowds from New Jersey's beaches, yet the freezing temperatures won't keep some surfers out of the water. They have grown up with ""ice cream headaches"" -- the painful ache when you eat something cold too fast -- they are the surfers from New Jersey. ""I've had times when icicles form in my hair,"" says surfer Andrew Gesler. Even the smallest waves will have the hardcore surfer walking over the snow-covered sand to take advantage of the power of the chilly Atlantic Ocean. For years, professional surfer and cancer survivor Dean Randazzo has been among those in the frigid waters, wearing a full wet suit, hoodie, gloves and booties. ""You just deal with your surroundings,"" says Randazzo, ""if you love something so much you just keep doing it."" Randazzo kept surfing year-round and it paid off in 1990 when he started making a living off the ocean. Early in his career at contests around the world, he would often be asked, ""Are there waves in Jersey?"" As filmmaker Alex DePhillipo shows in his newly released surfing documentary ""Dark Fall"", not only is the surf good in New Jersey, but there are a lot of good surfers in the state. The movie credits Randazzo, a New Jersey native, with proving that East Coast surfers are worthy contenders. ""He has absolutely paved the way for any surfer that wants to become a professional from New Jersey,"" says DePhillipo. Randazzo now just started his own line of surfboards. Gesler -- the narrator of ""Dark Fall"" and a professional surfer -- concurs, ""Randazzo is our big brother, coming from New Jersey you don't have a lot of people that have made the impression that Dean has."" It was the impression of a surfer and a state that took years for Randazzo to change. The money to be made in surfing comes from sponsors, appearances and editorial photographs. Only a few in the profession make enough money in surf contests to support themselves. Randazzo became a professional surfer in 1990, yet he still couldn't find a sponsor to support him. A sponsor pays the athletes to use or wear their product and they usually pick up the expenses incurred when traveling to contests. Randazzo couldn't find a sponsor to believe in him, no one wanted to get behind a surfer from the Garden State . ""I had to win money,"" recalls Randazzo, ""there were places on the tour when I wasn't eating if I didn't win money in that contest, or I didn't have a plane ticket home."" Winning money meant winning contests and in 1996 Randazzo became just one of 44 surfers to qualify for the World Championship Tour. ""Somehow I managed to do that with no sponsorship,"" says Randazzo, then dryly adding the word ""barely."" He also managed to put credibility into the New Jersey surf scene. ""Dean has paved the way,"" DePhillipo says, ""There's never been a surfer from New Jersey or the Northeast that's made the World Tour."" The success Randazzo has enjoyed is no surprise when you learn a bit more about this Jersey boy. Fighting to be respected in the surf scene was nothing compared to the four battles Randazzo fought and won against cancer. It was in 2001 when he was first diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph nodes. ""Everyone has their hometown hero, but in this case Dean's just like a state hero,"" says DePhillipo, ""he's even motivation for people who aren't from Jersey because of his fights, his battles."" When Randazzo isn't in the water he uses his celebrity status along with the sport he loves to raise money for the Dan Randazzo Cancer Foundation. Currently residing in California, Randazzo frequently returns to New Jersey. Not forgetting where he came from, the foundation sponsors an annual event called ""Surf for a Cause"" in his hometown of Margate. ""It's just one of those events that everybody wants to support even if they're not surfing, they want to support Dean,"" says Stacey Marchel, a Jersey surfer and the owner of Stacey's Surf Camp. As the film ""Dark Fall"" points out, it is because of Randazzo that being a surfer from New Jersey is no longer, as he puts it, ""like trying to be a professional snowboarder and growing up in Miami Beach."" Florida doesn't have snow but as captured in this new surf film, New Jersey definitely has waves. The state also experiences winter and that freezing season is what separates the surfing fraud from the fanatic. But as Randazzo or actually any Jersey surfer will tell you, the passion doesn't waiver with the weather.","Dean Randazzo surfed year around off the New Jersey shore until he went pro .

"(CNN) -- The stepmother of a missing 10-year-old North Carolina girl joined police as they searched for the girl's body Monday, the same day the girl's father landed behind bars. Elisa Baker, who police said last week admitted to writing a fake ransom note a day after the girl's disappearance was reported, was taken by police to a search site near a home she lived in three years ago, according to CNN affiliate WSOC. Earlier on Monday, shortly after 3 a.m., Adam Troy Baker was arrested in Catawba County on eight charges, including five counts of submitting worthless checks and three counts of failing to appear in court. Police earlier acknowledged that Adam Baker faced bad-check charges, which are unrelated to the disappearance of his daughter, Zahra Clare Baker. But they did not initially arrest him, as he had been helping authorities in their search. Zahra was reported missing October 9. But no one other than a family member has reported seeing her since September 25, when a woman saw her at a furniture store. Elisa Baker was arrested on October 10, initially on several charged unrelated charges, including writing worthless checks. Last week, she was additionally charged with obstruction of justice -- a felony -- after leaving the ransom note at the family's home. Authorities on Friday ended an unsuccessful search at a North Carolina landfill for a mattress connected to Zahra's disappearance, said police in Hickory. The adolescent's disappearance is being investigated as a homicide, police said. Local, state and federal authorities, along with cadaver dogs, are continuing to search Caldwell County and thereabouts for signs of Zahra. Zahra's father, Adam Troy Baker, was at Charlotte-Douglas International Airport picking up a family member Sunday before he voluntarily went to the police department in Hickory, about 60 miles northwest of Charlotte, to talk to authorities. At the request of Adam Baker -- an Australian citizen -- the closest Australian consulate, in Atlanta, Georgia, was notified of his arrest. The disappearance of Zahra, a freckle-faced youngster who wears a prosthetic leg and hearing aids, has made international news. The girl lost her leg to bone cancer, according to CNN affiliate WCNC-TV in Charlotte. Family members and neighbors have told reporters that Zahra's stepmother abused her -- an allegation her attorney has denied. Police also have said they had been in contact with Zahra's biological mother in Australia and asked for the girl's medical records.","NEW: The arrested stepmother of a missing 10-year-old joins police on search .

"(CNN) -- A man eating at his favorite fast-food restaurant took action Sunday night during an attempted armed robbery, teaming up with the store's manager to tackle the gunman and hold him down until police arrived. The incident took place at a Miami Subs in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Richard Barret told CNN affiliate WSVN that he didn't see the gunman enter, but he later saw him scuffling with restaurant manager Steve Lebrun. ""I went up and I grabbed the guy with like a WWE [wrestling move],"" Barret said Wednesday, describing how he and Lebrun drove the gunman into the floor headfirst. The scene was caught on the restaurant's surveillance video. Lebrun told WSVN he attacked the gunman after the gunman pulled the trigger and it did not go off. ""That's when I rushed and grabbed his wrist, took the gun from his hand and beat the living daylights out of him,"" Lebrun said. Another customer had dialed 911 during the scuffle, and he handed the phone to Barret while the gunman was incapacitated. ""He hands me the phone, and I'm laying on top of this guy, and I was there with the phone, and I'm going, ""Well, hello. I'm a little busy.' ... Now, looking back, it was kind of a comedy, but it sure wasn't at the time,"" Barret said. A 16-year-old suspect was arrested and, because he is a minor, was not identified. Police told WSVN they are investigating his possible connection with other robberies in the area.

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- Family members of 19 Chinese tourists, who went missing in Taiwan after Typhoon Megi triggered rock slides, are headed to the island, China's state media said Monday. The tourists from Zhuhai city in southern China went missing about 10 p.m. Thursday. Two other people -- a Taiwanese bus driver and a Chinese tour group leader from another tour bus -- also are missing, according to official Taiwanese media. Emergency crews rescued hundreds of other people who were trapped by the rock slides, which happened mainly along the Suhua Highway, in northeast Taiwan. Sections of the scenic highway, which is perched along a cliff on Taiwan's eastern coast, gave way. Typhoon Megi made landfall in China's southeastern province of Fujian on Saturday, affecting nearly 650,000 people and destroying 500 houses, China's Xinhua news agency said. About 270,000 people had evacuated. Damage in Fujian from the strongest typhoon of the year was estimated at 1.59 billion yuan ($238 million). No deaths or significant injuries were reported, thanks to rigorous typhoon precautions in Fujian, Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces, the state-run China Daily said Monday. Megi killed at least 13 people and injured nearly 100 others in Taiwan last week. It struck the Philippines earlier in the week, affecting an estimated 258,844 people and leaving thousands homeless.","Typhoon Megi triggers the rock slides .

"Morganton, North Carolina (CNN) -- Investigators spent another fruitless day Thursday looking for a 10-year-old North Carolina girl missing since last weekend and now believed dead, the local sheriff said. Authorities spent a third day combing an area about 20 miles north of Zahra Clare Baker's home in Hickory, North Carolina. This time, as many as 70 searchers were backed by dogs and a backhoe that was used to clear piles of wood and mulch, Burke County Sheriff John McDevitt said. The goal of Thursday's effort was to eliminate the possibility that Zahra's body had been dumped on the roughly 60 acres, McDevitt said. ""For the community's sake, we wanted to clear this area,"" he said. ""And for a large majority, we did that."" Zahra was reported missing Saturday afternoon. Her disappearance is being investigated as a homicide, and her stepmother has been arrested on charges of obstructing justice. The searches near Morganton started Tuesday as investigators focused on a lot where Zahra's father, Adam Baker, frequently worked hauling loads of wood and brush to be mulched. Wednesday, investigators came up empty after draining a pond next door. Police said this week that the stepmother, Elisa Baker, admitted to writing a fake ransom note that was left at the family's home. She was arrested Sunday on an unrelated charge of passing bad checks, prosecutors said. Elisa Baker remained jailed on those charges Thursday. Her bail has been set at a combined $70,000, an amount her lawyer called ""excessive."" Police said Adam Baker also faces bad-check charges, but is not being arrested while he assists police. ""At this point, he's doing what we ask him to do. If we need him to do something, he shows up,"" said Clyde Deal, Hickory's deputy police chief. Deal said other searches have been conducted, but the warrants have been sealed and no details are being released. Police said earlier this week that no one outside the girl's immediate family had reported seeing her for nearly a month. But Deal said Thursday that another witness had come forward to say they had seen Zahra in mid- to late September. Zahra reportedly suffered from bone cancer and used a prosthetic leg and hearing aids. The hearing aids have been found, but not the prosthesis, Hickory Police Chief Tom Adkins has said. Relatives and friends of the family have alleged that Elisa Baker physically abused Zahra and said she was reported to state social services officials. The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services has declined comment on the case. Hickory is about 60 miles northwest of Charlotte. HLN's Natisha Lance and Beth Carey contributed to this report.","A third day of extensive searching turns up nothing .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama announced new steps to help unemployed Americans on Friday, targeting people who are out of work and want to go back to school. President Obama has made education reform a top legislative priority. The president outlined a plan under which the Department of Education will send colleges legal guidance, encouraging them to increase financial aid packages for the unemployed so they can enroll in educational and training programs while keeping their unemployment benefits. Under Obama's initiative, colleges would consider a person's current financial situation to make it possible for them to receive Pell grants, which are available for low-income students. The unemployed person would not lose any unemployment benefits and the maximum Pell grant would be increased in July by $500 to $5,350. Current unemployment rules create a Catch-22: In most cases, if you are receiving unemployment compensation, you have to be actively looking for a job. If you want to get more education or training, you have to give up unemployment benefits. But if you return to school, you don't qualify for federal education grants since, in most cases, your qualification is based on the previous year's income. The government has started a Web site with information on the plan: www.opportunity.gov. The Labor Department will also issue guidance ""strongly encouraging"" states to modernize their rules to allow more unemployed to continue their education without forfeiting their benefits. ""In a 21st-century economy where the most valuable skill you can sell is your knowledge, education is the single best bet we can make,"" Obama said. The unemployment system should not just be a safety net but ""a stepping stone to a new future. ... It should offer folks educational opportunities they wouldn't otherwise have and give them the measurable and differentiated skills they need to not just get through these hard times but to get ahead when the economy comes back."" Obama's remarks came shortly after the government announced that the unemployment rate hit a 25-year high in April, rising to 8.9 percent from 8.5. percent in March. There were signs of hope, however, as the monthly job loss total fell to the lowest level in six months. CNN's Jill Doherty and Chris Isidore contributed to this report.","NEW: President Obama says ""education is the single best bet we can make""

"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- With all eyes focused on how the Democrats will do this November, the story about the divisions unfolding within the Republican Party have equally important long-term consequences for national politics. And now with the Tea Party movement as an additional force in the party, Republican leaders are struggling to contain tensions between right-wing activists and fiscal conservatives. In recent months, these tensions have been growing because new faces have emerged within the Republican Party that don't fit neatly within the Tea Party fold. One of the candidates who has received the most buzz in Republican circles is New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, dubbed ""Gov. Wrecking Ball"" by one columnist. How Christie fares in the coming year will be a critical test to gauging where the GOP might be in 2012. The blunt and humorous Republican who replaced Democratic Gov. Jon Corzine has been making a name for himself by taking on New Jersey's fiscal mess. Christie, a former U.S. attorney general who looks and sounds like the kind of guy you would sit next to at a New York Jets game, has focused all of his energy on reducing the budget and limiting property tax increases. He has been willing to challenge powerful interest groups like the teachers' unions, and he didn't budge when citizen protesters took to the streets and railed against the impact of his budget. Christie also instituted reforms to the pensions of government workers. He has received some grudging support from Democrats and has persuaded the state legislature to go along with many controversial proposals, primarily because most experts acknowledge tough steps are needed to avoid having New Jersey become another California. The first test for Christie will be the political response when New Jersey residents see the impact of the budget cuts. Historically, at the national level, Republicans have often backed off from tough talk about spending reduction when programs proved to be more popular than conservatives expected. This is what happened when President Ronald Reagan was forced to back off Social Security cuts in 1981-1982 and the Republican Congress stepped away from Medicare cuts in 1995-1996. In New Jersey, it is one thing for voters to hear tough talk on controlling spending coming out of Trenton, but quite another to see your child's school program shut down. Now that congressional Democrats are on the verge of passing legislation to provide aid to the states in these areas of government, the contrast will be even sharper. There are also many questions about whether Christie's actions will really be able to stop property taxes from rising. The second test has to do with whether Christie, assuming that he continues to be successful, can find a place at the national Republican Party table. In the era of the Tea Party, the Republican leadership has been moving toward the right on many nonfiscal issues. Last week, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said he favored the idea of reviewing the 14th Amendment -- originally passed to protect the citizenship rights of freed African-American slaves. Some Republicans, including South Carolina Sen. Lindsay Graham, want to make sure that citizenship rights are not granted to children who are born to illegal immigrants in the United States. Also, the ruling by a federal judge that California's ban on gay marriage is unconstitutional is sure to generate pressure on Republicans to take a tough stand on this issue. Following the 2008 election, the conservative commentator and former speechwriter for President George W. Bush, David Frum, a CNN contributor, had warned that Republicans needed to be cautious about doing things to win in 2010 that would harm them in 2012 and beyond. The threat is to radicalize the party by moving it so far off center that future Republican candidates would have trouble winning national office. As Frum wrote in his blog post with regard to health care reform, ""We followed the most radical voices in the party and the movement, and they led us to abject and irreversible defeat."" If Republicans want to rebuild their party, they must make room for more pragmatic, fiscally minded conservatives like Christie, who are generating excitement in famously blue states. If Christie can survive politically from the fallout of the budget cuts, he and other Republicans like him could cause significant trouble for Democrats by focusing on issues like taxes, deficits and spending that, at least on the campaign trail, have often had far more impact than the social issues that tend to excite the Republican Party's base. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is earning praise for tackling budget problems .

"(CNN) -- The mother of an 11-year-old boy who hanged himself after allegedly being bullied at a Georgia school says her daughter also has been a victim of taunting. Masika Bermudez-Carrasquillo, who Friday asked the White House for help in a campaign to end school bullying, said her daughter, 12, was also recently harassed by a boy who kept referring to her dead brother. The boy was disciplined but still taunted the girl before he was suspended and his mother withdrew him from a middle school, she said. Since then, the boy's mom has failed to meet with her, Bermudez said. ""I guess she doesn't care."" The mother, who wrote a letter to President Barack Obama about bullying, held a news conference Friday to ask for help. Jaheem Herrera was found dead in his closet in April. ""Til this day, I live with that memory of seeing my son hanging in the closet; my daughters are so hurt too,"" Bermudez wrote in the letter. Bermudez told CNN that Jaheem, a fifth-grader, had been complaining about bullying at Dunaire Elementary School in DeKalb County. Bermudez said that at the time, she did not know that the bullying had gotten so bad. Friday, she indicated Jaheem once passed out after boys put him in a sleeper hold at the school. Administrators and others won't take responsibility for this and other incidents at the school, she said. ""I feel like I failed him,"" Bermudez said of Jaheem. ""I can't get justice. A year has passed, and they keep denying it."" Her letter asked for assistance from the White House. ""Mr. President, bullying is still an issue here in Georgia, and all over the United States. Our children are dying, because they think this is the only way out. I think parents and administrators should be held accountable for the safety problems in the nation's classrooms,"" Bermudez said. She says her son's case helped to get a new anti-bullying law passed in Georgia. The law, which pushes schools to aggressively investigate bullying incidents and provide counseling to victims, is scheduled to go into effect in 2011. But Bermudez said more needs to be done. ""No other parent should feel the pain I feel.  Mr. President, I need your help,"" she wrote. ""It is my hope that you hear my plea and join the campaign for Justice for Jaheem."" Families of bullying victims should be able to file federal lawsuits against local officials and parents of those who bully, she said. Gerald Rose, who heads the nonprofit New Order National Human Rights Organization, said the type of discipline that might prevent bullying needs to begin at the home. ""We need to get justice for this mom,"" Rose said. CNN's Max Newfield contributed to this report.","Mother says her daughter also has been bullied .

"Washington (CNN) -- The owner of one farm at the center of a massive egg recall apologized to anyone who may have been sickened by his product Wednesday, while another refused to answer questions about conditions at his operation. Orland Bethel, president of Hillandale Farms of Iowa, invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination when asked whether he knew about unsanitary conditions at one of his farms before an August e-mail from a production manager. Bethel was appearing before a House subcommittee investigating the outbreak of Salmonella enteritidis that sickened more than 1,600 people and triggered the recall of more than half a billion eggs. Duane Mangskau, Hillandale Farms production representative, told the committee that the recall has forced his firm ""to take a hard look at our operations."" ""And even if the source of the salmonella illness is never confirmed, where we have fallen short in Iowa, we are committed to improving our operations,"" Mangskau said. He said Hillandale has cut its marketing relationship with another DeCoster-owned farm ""because we were disappointed with the test results there."" Meanwhile, the owner of the other agribusiness firm involved in the recall said he was ""horrified"" that eggs from his company may have sickened anyone. ""We apologize to everyone who may have been sickened by eating our eggs. I pray several times each day for all of them and for their improved health,"" Austin ""Jack"" DeCoster, the owner of Wright County Egg, told the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee. DeCoster -- whose chicken and hog farms have been repeatedly cited by state regulators in the Northeast and Midwest -- said his company's compliance with food safety regulation suffered as it grew, and ""I am sorry for those failings."" ""I accept responsibility for those mistakes in our operations,"" he told the committee. And DeCoster's son Peter, Wright County Egg's chief operating officer, told the subcommittee that ""while we always believed we were doing the right thing, it is now very clear that we must do more."" But the DeCosters faced sharp questions throughout the hearing from lawmakers, including the chairman of the full committee, Rep. Henry Waxman. Salmonella occurs naturally in chickens, but Food and Drug Administration inspectors reported in August that neither Wright County nor Hillandale fully followed their plans to prevent Salmonella enteritidis, the strain behind the outbreak. Federal investigators reported finding salmonella bacteria in chicken feed and in barn and walkway areas at the farms, as well as rodents, heaping piles of manure, dead animals and uncaged birds and flies too numerous to count. ""It's hard for me to reconcile your words, that you wanted to clean up and you did clean up the facility, with the record before the committee,"" said Waxman, D-California. ""The conditions in your facility were not clean. They were not sanitary. They were filthy."" But the committee's ranking Republican, Texas Rep. Michael Burgess, also questioned why Department of Agriculture inspectors failed to report conditions at Wright County Egg to the FDA. ""If you know this is a high-risk food and a high-risk practice -- and the deCosters kind of have a history -- why wouldn't someone say something?"" Burgess asked Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, the FDA's principal deputy commissioner. Burgess suggested the outbreak could have been averted ""if one federal agency had used common sense and talked to another feeral agency. "" Sharfstein said the FDA and the USDA, which regulate different aspects of the industry, ""are working on improving communication."" But he said new regulations on egg producers and a food-safety bill pending in the Senate ""would allow us to make those inspections as effective as possible."" At the outset of the hearing, Waxman said the DeCoster family has had ""warning after warning"" about conditions at its operations for decades. Despite those warnings, DeCoster family companies ""continue to raise chickens in slovenly conditions and make millions of dollars by selling contaminated eggs,"" he said. And DeCoster's remarks were briefly interrupted by a protester the Farm Animal Rights Movement, a group critical of industrialized agriculture. The man carried a banner that proclaimed, ""Recall ALL egg production."" ""DeCoster and his cohorts are a mere piece of a larger picture,"" the man said before being escorted from the hearing room. There were fireworks among members of the committee as well, as its ranking Republican tried to rebut Democrats' criticism of Oklahoma Republican Sen. Tom Coburn, who is fighting new food safety legislation supporters say could have prevented the outbreak. At one point, subcommittee Chairman Bart Stupak, D-Michigan, cut off Burgess's microphone when he tried to read a statement blaming the Senate's Democratic leadership for stalling the bill. Burgess later accused Stupak of ""censorship."" Stupak said Burgess -- who supported the legislation -- tried to ""back-door"" a statement from Oklahoma Sen. Tom Coburn into the record after his time had expired and without the consent of the committee. One of those sickened in this summer's outbreak was Sarah Lewis, who told the subcommittee she ended up in an intensive-care unit after eating a custard tart at a party for her sister's college graduation. Her sister also fell ill. She said she still suffers from severe abdominal cramps, diarrhea and fevers and has to take between five to 10 drugs a day. ""I lost 30 pounds,"" she said. ""My sick joke is, 'You can cure my salmonella in 30 more pounds,' you know what I mean? But it's not funny.""","NEW: Hillandale CEO takes the Fifth Amendment in salmonella hearing .

"(CNN) -- The Portuguese Football Federation has banned national coach Carlos Queiroz for a month following an incident involving an anti-doping team before the 2010 World Cup. The 57-year-old will miss next month's opening Euro 2012 qualifiers against Cyprus and Norway for his part in the confrontation when the drug test controllers visited Portugal's training camp in Covilha in June. Queiroz had initially fought the charges, and brought in his former mentor Alex Ferguson of English club Manchester United as a character witness. The former Real Madrid coach was also fined $1,280 for his part in the matter, as the FPF said on its website on Thursday that his ""aggressive behavior"" had disrupted the testing procedure. The Ministry of Youth and Sport filed a report after the Sports Institute of Portugal complained about Queiroz. He will now miss the home match against Cyprus on September 3 and the trip to Norway four days later. Queiroz is under pressure to produce results, having needed to go to the playoffs to qualify for the World Cup and then losing to eventual champions and neighbors Spain in the second round in South Africa. Portugal failed to score in three of the four World Cup matches despite being led by the world's most expensive player, Real's Cristiano Ronaldo.","Carlos Queiroz will miss Portugal's opening Euro 2012 qualifiers after being banned .

"(CNN) -- A flat-faced frogfish, bug-eating slug and carnivorous sea sponge are some of the top new species named by scientists. They appear on a ""top 10"" list of new species released Saturday amid warnings from the United Nations that the world is not doing enough to protect vulnerable eco-systems. ""Biodiversity loss is moving ecological systems ever closer to tipping point beyond which they will no longer be able to fulfill their vital functions,"" said Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on the International Day for Biological Diversity,  which is being marked in 11 countries. More coverage: Environment . A report released in late April by researchers from the United Nations Environment Program showed that world leaders had failed on a 2002 commitment to reduce the global rate of biodiversity loss by 2010. It found that since 1970 animal populations had dropped 30 percent, the area covered by mangroves and sea grasses was down 20 percent and the coverage of living corals had fallen 40 percent. ""The deadline has arrived, yet the deterioration of our natural resources continues apace,"" the secretary-general said in a statement. He warned that communities everywhere would ""reap the negative consequences,"" but that the ""poorest people and most vulnerable communities will suffer most."" A number of events were held around the world Saturday to mark the International Day of Biodiversity. A garden was created along Paris' Champs-Elysees, children in Brazil were encouraged to dress up as animals, and the European Environment Agency unveiled a ""living wall"" at its headquarters in Copenhagen, Denmark. The release of a top 10 list species for 2009 continues an annual tradition that marks the anniversary of the birth of Carolus Linnaeus, who initiated the modern system of classifying plants and animals. The new list, issued by the International Institute for Species Exploration at Arizona State University,  was chosen from 18,225 species new to science in 2008, the most recent year for which data has been compiled. They come from Africa, Indonesia, Madagascar, Myanmar, New Zealand, the Philippines, Thailand, the U.S. and Uruguay. The new discoveries include a golden orb spider able to spin webs of more than a meter in diameter. It is the first of its species named since 1879. A minnow with fangs found in Myanmar is the first example of oral teeth-like structure found in the largest family of freshwater fishes. And, the sea slug that eats bugs was an unusual find in Pak Phanang Bay in the Gulf of Thailand as nearly all sacoglossans, or sea slugs, eat algae. ""Most people do not realize just how incomplete our knowledge of Earth's species is or the steady rate at which taxonomists are exploring that diversity,"" said Quentin Wheeler, director of the International Institute of Species Exploration.","Top 10 new species list includes frogfish, golden orb spider, bug-eating slugs .

"(CNN) -- A major rainstorm washed over the water-weary Northeast Tuesday, flooding much of the already saturated region but focusing its withering power on the tiny state of Rhode Island. ""Right now, most of our eyes are on the Pawtuxet River in Cranston,"" said Tom Econopouly, a senior hydrologist at the Northeast River Forecast Center in nearby Taunton, Massachusetts. The river was predicted to crest Wednesday morning near 20 feet -- flood stage is 9 feet, he said, adding, ""It's very high."" Another record was set in Yantic, Connecticut, where the Yantic River crested Tuesday at 13.6 feet, 4.6 feet above flood stage, he said. Yet another record was predicted for Saxonville, Massachusetts, where the Sudbury River was expected to reach 13.4 feet Wednesday afternoon. Flood stage is 10 feet. ""I've been working here for over 10 years and I really haven't seen anything like this in my career,"" Econopouly said. Is it flooding near you? Share photos, videos and stories . The cause of all the records was a storm system ""that just didn't move"" since it formed Sunday night, he said. By late Tuesday, the storm was lifting, but several rivers had not yet crested, he said. In all, the storm system dumped 8.75 inches of rain in East Providence, 7.6 inches in downtown Providence, and 5 inches in Cranston, all in Rhode Island, he said. Compounding the misery was the fact that parts of the region were still trying to shake off the effects of a storm two weeks ago. And this week's system -- with heavy winds and rain -- has left thousands of customers without power. On the National Weather Service map posted on its Web site, the coast was covered in bright green from Maine to Delaware, indicating widespread flood warnings. ""We haven't seen the worst of it yet,"" Rhode Island Gov. Donald Carcieri told reporters Tuesday night after seven to eight inches of rain had inundated much of the state. He pleaded with state residents to stay off the roads. ""We are very concerned about flooding on the highways,"" he said. The Blackstone River in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, and the Pawcatuck River in Charleston, Rhode Island, were not expected to crest until 8 a.m. Wednesday, he said. ""None of us alive have seen the kind of flooding we are experiencing now,"" he said, calling the downpour an event that occurs once every 100 years to 500 years. Sewage treatment plants around the state were swamped, with one in Warwick, Rhode Island, ""completely inundated,"" he said. That led the Department of Health to order the closure of all beaches in the state. Emergency officials asked residents of affected areas to try to conserve water. Decisions about school closings were to be announced in the morning, he said. Carcieri urged residents of low-lying areas not to jeopardize their safety by refusing to comply with officials' requests to evacuate. He noted that some members of the National Guard have been deployed to help. Cranston Mayor Allan Fung said about 120 homes had been evacuated in the western part of the city. Dam safety was to be monitored overnight, said Dave Smith, director of the Emergency Management Agency. ""The water that's running through the throats of some of those dams is remarkable,"" he said. A spokesman for National Grid Energy Services said 12,000 to 14,000 customers were without electricity in the Cranston area, where a substation was underwater. In Westerly, Rhode Island, another 9,600 customers were in the dark, the spokesman said. He told area residents to expect rotating outages throughout the night and predicted they would continue for ""a period of days."" Gas was turned off in some areas, too, he said. Shelters have been set up throughout the state, said Rhode Island Lt. Governor Elizabeth Roberts. ""We are looking at historic levels,"" said Luke Peterson, the assistant town manager for West Warwick, Rhode Island. The Pawtuxet River in Cranston and West Warwick, about 13 miles southwest of Providence, flooded a few weeks ago at record levels. This time, Peterson said, the town has received reports predicting that the river, which reaches flood stage at 9 feet, will crest at 17.5 feet at nearby Cranston. The river crested at 14.98 feet more than two weeks ago. ""There's not a whole lot we can do,"" Peterson said. ""If we try to hold back on our side, we'd make it worse for the neighboring community."" Still, no deaths have been reported in Rhode Island. That was also the case in Massachusetts, where four to seven inches of rain had fallen in the eastern part of the state during this latest storm, said Scott MacLeod, a public information officer with the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency in Framingham, Massachusetts. Most of the flooding in Massachusetts occurred in the Bay State's southeastern corner county of Bristol, Massachusetts, where about 200 people were evacuated, he said. On Monday, Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard, which was prepared to assist overnight, MacLeod said. A handful of shelters were open, though few people were staying there, and there were no reports of power outages in the state, MacLeod said. ""It's mainly flooding issues -- closed roads, flooded roadways and basements."" Though the rain was expected to stop overnight in Massachusetts, ""the flooding will continue throughout the week for a number of our rivers and streams,"" MacLeod predicted. The storm delayed flights at Boston's Logan International Airport, all three New York-area airports and Philadelphia International Airport in Pennsylvania, according to the Federal Aviation Administration's Web site. Connecticut Gov. Jodi Rell said she was putting the state National Guard on alert to assist with flood control and sandbagging efforts. By Tuesday night, a spokesman for the state's Department of Emergency Management and Homeland Security said rivers were still rising. ""We do have significant flooding in the southeastern part of the state,"" said public information officer Scott DeVico. Particularly affected were the areas around the Connecticut cities of Norwich, Stonington and Groton City, he said. But no fatalities had been reported and fewer than 400 customers were without power, he said. Though no major highways were shut, a number of secondary roads were closed in low-lying areas, he said. In New Jersey, the city of Wayne issued a flood warning but said it was not issuing evacuations. In Paterson, New Jersey, minor flooding was reported, the city fire department said. In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and the Delaware Valley, the National Weather Service issued a coastal flood advisory.","Pawtuxet River in Cranston, Rhode Island may crest 11 feet above flood stage .

"(CNN)  -- Rebel leader Laurent Nkunda wants to merge his forces with the Democratic Republic of Congo's army as part of a peace agreement, a mediator said Monday. Rebel leader Laurent Nkunda has urged the Congolese government to find ways to protect minority groups. Former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo told reporters that talks between Nkunda and Congo's government are progressing. Nakunda ""has made demands that I do not consider outrageous and demands that the government of Congo can meet,"" said Obasanjo. The rebel leader has also urged the Congo government to find ways to protect minority groups in the country, Obasanjo said. Obasanjo, a U.N. special envoy, said the ongoing talks may quell violence in the country. More negotiations have been scheduled for Friday. The recent fighting has prompted the U.N. Security Council to approve sending more than 3,000 troops in coming weeks to bolster the 17,000-strong peacekeeping force already there. The goal is to stop the violence that has deepened the stark humanitarian crisis in North Kivu province of Congo. The fighting has displaced an estimated 250,000 people many who have fled to refugee camps. Fighting broke out in eastern Congo at the end of August between government forces and Nkunda's rebels. The fighting is spurred by lingering tensions over the 1994 slaughter of ethnic Tutsis by majority Hutus in neighboring Rwanda. Nkunda says his forces are fighting to defend Congolese Tutsis from Hutu militants who escaped to Congo.","Rebel leader Laurent Nkunda wants to meld his forces with army, mediator reports .

"(CNN) -- Somalia may need to triple its peacekeeping troops to 20,000 in the coming months to combat a surging threat by militants, a U.N. official said. ""The threat level in Mogadishu and in southern-central Somalia has actually increased,"" Augustine Mahiga told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday. Mahiga said he is concerned about the security in the country and its impact in the region. ""A scaled up assistance from the international community is needed to make a difference,"" said Mahiga, the special envoy to Somalia. The additional troops, he said, will help fight Islamist rebels who have been battling peacekeeping troops and government forces. The African Union Mission in Somalia has been helping government forces fight al Shabab rebels in the country. African Union peacekeepers are mostly from Uganda and Burundi. The troop currently has about 6,000 troops -- 2,000 short of its authorized limit, Mahiga said. The envoy said plans are under way to submit a request for more troops in Somalia to the United Nations Security Council. Al Shabab has claimed responsibility for July suicide attacks in Uganda that left more than 70 people dead. The United States considers the group, which is al Qaeda's proxy in the country, a terrorist organization. Al-Shabaab is waging a war against Somalia's government in an effort to implement a stricter form of Islamic law, or sharia. Somalia has not had a stable government since 1991, and fighting between the rebels and government troops has escalated the humanitarian crisis in the famine-ravaged country.","The threat level is going up, a U.N. envoy says .

"(CNN) -- Two planes collided in midair Saturday in Boulder, Colorado, killing three people, authorities said. One of the planes, a single-seat Piper Pawnee, was towing a glider. The pilot of the Piper died in the collision, said Rick Brough of the Boulder County Sheriff's Office. But the pilot of the glider, which was carrying two passengers, detached from the plane and landed safely, Brough said. Two people on the second plane, a Cirrus SR 20, also died, Brough said. Authorities began receiving reports of a plane crash around 1:30 p.m. MT, Brough said, adding that people had seen flames in the air in an area less than five miles from the Boulder Municipal Airport. The collision was described as ""immediate disintegration and explosion of both planes,"" said Jennifer Rodi, an air safety investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board. Rodi called the glider's occupants ""very lucky"" during a news conference Sunday and praised the glider's pilot. ""The glider was attached to the Piper Pawnee when the pilot observed the Cirrus aircraft out of the corner of his eye,"" she said. ""He immediately noted they were on a collision course and elected to separate the tow strap from the Piper Pawnee."" ""He did his job that he signed up for as a commercial pilot,"" Rodi said. Rodi said the Cirrus was traveling south and the Pawnee was traveling west at the time of the collision. The debris field was spread out over a couple of miles, Brough said. ""I was in my house and I heard a loud bang,"" iReporter Zac Mitchell, of Boulder, told CNN. ""I looked out my window and saw a giant fireball in the sky."" When he went outside, he said he saw smoke and two objects, including a parachute, falling from the sky. Cirrus aircraft come equipped with an airframe parachute system that deploys in the event of an in-air emergency. It's designed to safely lower the plane to the ground. The NTSB and the Federal Aviation Administration are involved in investigating the incident, Brough said. CNN's Leslie Tripp, John Branch and Nick Valencia contributed to this report.","Three people were killed Saturday in a midair collision over Boulder, Colorado .

"(CNN)  -- Houston Rockets team physician Tom Clanton has said the foot injury currently sidelining Chinese center Yao Ming could threaten the seven-foot-six-inch player's career. Yao Ming's entire basketball future could be in danger due to his persistent foot injury. ""At this point, the injury has the potential for him missing this next season and could be career-threatening,"" Clanton told the Houston Chronicle regional newspaper. ""One of the things we are trying to get is a consensus opinion on that, to make certain there is no option we are overlooking that would provide an earlier return or would be an option for treatment that he would prefer rather than doing additional surgery,"" he added. Yao fractured his left foot last month during a semifinal match against the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Western Conference semifinals and has been visiting specialists ahead of treatment since then. Clanton continued: ""At this stage, he is having no symptoms or physical signs, he has no tenderness, no swelling, no redness. When he came back in, he was feeling like everything was perfect, and he would start rehabilitation and get ready to play. ""The findings on the CT were shocking for him and for us. You don't treat a CT scan; you treat a patient. We are looking for every reason to treat this on clinical findings but don't want to put him at risk for a greater fracture,"" he added. The diagnosis raises doubt over the playing future of one of the biggest stars in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and one of the most famous celebrities to hail from China. Yao is a national hero in his homeland, and the news has prompted a frenzy of postings on the internet, arguing about the why's and wherefore's of his injury. ""He is really tired,"" says one Netizen posting on Sina.com. ""He needs to rest, we cannot let the giant fall!"" ""I wish everything will work out well for Yao Ming,"" says another teenage basketball fan. ""There is always a way to deal with injuries. We should not give up."" Some Yao supporters think he should take a long break -- even for the whole season -- and make a comeback later. ""I think his injury is very bad,"" opines Ma Jian, a TV commentator who played for the Chinese national team. ""With all the weight training the team have put him through in the past seven years, Yao has gained about 20 kilos in his upper body. But his lower body, especially his feet, did not gain much strength to hold his large frame."" The 28-year-old Yao has been a perennial pick for the NBA All-Star teams since moving from the Shanghai Sharks to the Rockets in 2002. Yao also captained the Chinese team as hosts at the 2008 Beijing Games, as well as taking the role of flag-bearer in the opening ceremony. Yao was awarded the honor of ""model worker"" in 2005 by China's ruling Communist Party. However, despite his popularity, Yao still has his share of detractors. Known as ""Yao hei"" -- they are people who are out to smear the player. ""He is a man made of glass,"" says one posting on Sina.com. ""Should we call him Yao the glass or Yao the porcelain?"" asks one rhetorically. Yao is now a multi-millionaire, earning millions of dollars yearly, not just from his NBA team but from lucrative commercial endorsements. Admirers say Yao has done more for improving China's image overseas than any modern-day politician or diplomat. Next to the giant panda, Yao is perhaps China's best known and much loved, icon, in part because exudes a wholesome, feel-good image. ""He is such an affable, likeable guy,"" recalls Colin Pine, who used to serve as his personal translator during his years as an NBA rookie in Houston. His demeanor on and off the court has endeared him to the media and multitude of basketball fans overseas, who admire his modesty and maturity. His loyal fans hope Yao will get an extension of his already long and successful career.","Houston Rockets physician says Yao Ming injury could ""threaten his career""

"New Haven, Connecticut (CNN) -- Steven Hayes, convicted of killing three members of a Connecticut family, has shown ""suicidal tendencies"" and expressed concern his food was tainted, a psychiatrist testified during the penalty phase of Hayes' trial Monday. Dr. Justin Schechter, a Stamford, Connecticut, forensic and clinical psychiatrist, said that Hayes exhibited signs of depression after his 2007 arrest, but told him, ""I would rather they kill me"" -- reflecting Hayes' apparent hope that he'd be executed for his role in in the deaths of Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her daughters, 17-year-old Hayley Petit and 11-year-old Michaela Petit. The jury must decide whether to sentence Hayes to death. Hayes wasn't in solitary confinement or considered ""actively suicidal,"" said Schechter, though there were concerns he had a seizure disorder, depression and anxiety. The high school dropout said he had a long history of substance abuse and had fathered two children out of wedlock, Schechter said. Hayes believed that a doctor was ""manipulating"" his food and wouldn't eat it, said Schechter, though he did eat food from the prison commissary. The court session ended with Schechter's testimony on Monday afternoon, and will resume Tuesday. Hayes, 47, was convicted this month of 16 of the 17 charges against him -- including nine counts of murder and capital murder and four counts of kidnapping -- in the deaths of Hawke-Petit and her daughters. Prosecutors allege that Hayes and Joshua Komisarjevsky invaded the Petit home in Cheshire, beat Jennifer Hawke-Petit's husband bloody, strangled Hawke-Petit, set the house afire and tried to flee. Komisarjevsky is to be tried separately. Earlier in the day, Fred Levesque, former director of offender classification and population management for the state Department of Correction, testified that Hayes was written up for 24 disciplinary reports during a stretch in state prison. One of those was for hoarding medication, a charge to which Hayes voluntarily pleaded guilty. Asked by the defense if he had any knowledge of whether Hayes was a threat to the general population, Levesque answered ""no."" Last week, a forensic psychiatrist testified that Hayes attempted suicide several times since his arrest and has said he wants to receive the death penalty. On cross-examination, Dr. Paul Amble said his panel did not address the question of whether Hayes' suicide attempts were sincere. But in his opinion, he said, Hayes was ""making decisions that were rational, given his situation"" when he said he wanted to receive the death penalty. ""I want to plead guilty to everything now, because I just want it over now,"" Hayes told an evaluation team, said Amble, the assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Yale University School of Medicine. Hayes described a plan to ""look like a monster"" to the jury, expressing no remorse, in an attempt to move the jurors to sentence him to death, Amble wrote in his evaluation of the defendant. Prosecutor Michael Dearington asked Amble whether Hayes truly wanted to be executed. ""I don't know,"" the doctor said. ""I'm not here to say I can exactly divine his thoughts, only what he said."" In March, Hayes told a psychologist that he no longer wanted to commit suicide ""but intended to let the state do it,"" said Amble, who had been asked by the judge in the case to determine whether Hayes was competent to stand trial. Police testified that in the 2007 home invasion, Hayes and Komisarjevsky found evidence of a bank account containing $20,000 to $30,000 and forced Hawke-Petit to go to a bank in the morning and withdraw money from the account. Prosecutors said Hayes took her to the bank while Komisarjevsky stayed behind. When Hayes and Hawke-Petit returned with the money, officials said, the two men set the home afire and fled. Inside the home, authorities said, Hawke-Petit, 48, was found raped and strangled. Her two daughters, one of whom had been sexually assaulted, died of smoke inhalation. Petit, the sole survivor, escaped to a neighbor's home. CNN'S Brian Vitagliano contributed to this report.","NEW: A psychiatrist says Hayes has exhibited ""suicidal tendencies""

"(CNN)  -- Togo international Emmanuel Adebayor scored a timely hat-trick as Manchester City all but guaranteed their passage into the knockout stage of the Europa League with a 3-1 win over Lech Poznan at Eastlands. It was the first goals of the season for Adebayor and a reminder of his talents to manager Roberto Mancini with City heavily linked with a move for Manchester United's star striker Wayne Rooney in the January transfer window. Rooney would be reunited with Carlos Tevez should he choose to join United's city rivals, the Argentine rested by Mancini for Thursday's match against spirited Polish opposition. Adebayor put City two-up early in the first half, but Lech hit back through Joel Tshibamba just after the break and had chances to equalize before the striker sealed victory with his third goal late in the second half after being set up by the excellent David Silva. England winger Adam Johnson nearly scored a superb individual fourth, but the night belonged to Adebayor, who might have also added to his tally. The win sees them top of Group A ahead of Lech, with Juventus in third after their 1-1 draw in Salzburg. Earlier, fellow English Premier League side Liverpool battled to a goalless draw against Napoli in the southern Italian city. There was a massive police presence at the San Paolo stadium after attacks on Liverpool supporters prior to the tie. Liverpool manager Roy Hodgson, under pressure after their dismal start to the English Premier League season, fielded an inexperienced side lacking Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres and they did him proud. With five points from three games, they remain top and favorites to qualify from Group K . ""We're going through a very bad passage in the league, things haven't gone our way for a variety of reasons and that's why we find ourselves down the bottom and desperate to get away,"" Hodgson told AFP. In other Europa League action, Portuguse giants Porto scored their third win from three as they triumphed 3-1 at Turkey's Besiktas - despite having two men sent off. Falcao hit the opener and Hulk scored the other two goals before Bobo netted a consolation for the hosts. Paris St Germain remain unbeaten in Group J as the French side thanked Clement Chantome for a late equaliser against Bundesliga leaders Borussia Dortmund. The Germans had gone ahead through Nuri Sahin penalty. Spain's Sevilla are chasing PSG in second in a tough group, one point behind, after a 1-0 win at Karpaty Lviv with Frederic Kanoute scoring the winner.","Emmanuel Adebayor scores a hat-trick as Manchester City beat Lech Poznan 3-1 .

"(CNN) -- Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger asked the White House to make a federal disaster declaration in the aftermath of last week's pipeline explosion and fire in San Bruno, California, his office said Wednesday. ""This event has destroyed and caused serious damages to homes, infrastructure, and other public facilities in San Mateo County,"" Schwarzenegger said in a letter to President Obama. ""The response and recovery costs for this event are estimated at nearly $10.4 million."" A disaster declaration from the White House would free federal funds to cover those costs. The request came as a consumer watchdog group said pipeline owner Pacific Gas & Electric had planned in 2009 to replace a section of its gas pipeline just a couple of miles from the section that exploded, but never spent the $5 million in rate increases to do the work. TURN [The Utility Reform Network] also said the utility asked for another $5 million for the same project in 2009 -- the year it should have completed the work it hasn't even started -- saying it wouldn't be completed until 2013. ""The money was spent on what they call higher priority work,"" said TURN senior attorney Mike Florio. ""You can't track the dollars one by one, but we do know they spent $62 million more on management incentive business than they had forecast in 2009,"" he said. ""They spent $60 million on going back and re-doing gas leak surveys that they had botched elsewhere on their system."" PG&E responded that it ""is committed to performing the work necessary to assure the safety of its gas transmission system."" The utility said it had identified the line section as a ""high priority project"" in the earlier transmission rate filing, but ""rescheduled the project"" after an updated assessment in 2009. But the company did not explain why it needed an additional $5 million and three years to complete repairs on a section it said, in its most recent rate filing, was in the top 100 risks for failure. ""Coupled with the consequences of failure of this section of pipeline, the likelihood of a failure makes the risk of a failure at this location unacceptably high,"" the company said in that filing. TURN officials think they know where some of the money went -- in 2009, the year PG&E didn't spend $5 million on fixing the pipeline, the company did spend $5 million on bonuses for six top executives. ""The company's priorities appear to be skewed,"" TURN executive director Mark Toney said. The line that exploded in San Bruno was laid down in 1948, as was the section PG&E was supposed to replace. In the first filing, the utility noted that the ""vintage 30-inch pipeline"" runs through ""several High Consequence Areas."" In the second, it said the pipeline was ""located in a heavily urbanized area."" Four people were killed in the September 9 explosion and fire in the San Francisco suburb, and three are still missing. The blast blew in the doors of a grocery store a quarter-mile (400 meters) away, and the explosion and resulting fire injured 52 people and destroyed 37 homes. The explosion blew a 28-foot section of the pipeline 100 feet in the air. In the filing documents provided by TURN, the section of pipe to be replaced is identified as in the top 100 for highest risks of failure. Since exact locations of pipelines are generally kept secret because of terrorism threats, residents may not even know they live near one until it's too late. ""If they fixed that section that they said wanted to fix maybe they would have found something that led them to look a mile or two south of there,"" Florio said. ""We don't know that. We do know that the project was slated for 2009. It didn't get done. Now they're proposing to do it again in 2013."" The California Public Utilities Commission has not made a decision on this latest increase request. PG&E has agreed to set up a $100 million fund to help rebuild parts of San Bruno.

"(CNN) -- South Korea's Red Cross has offered $8.4 million in flood aid to North Korea, the Yonhap news agency said Tuesday. The aid includes medical kits, food and emergency supplies, South Korea Unification Ministry spokesman Chun Hae-sung told reporters. The Red Cross is Seoul's main channel for humanitarian aid to North Korea. The communist nation has not replied to the offer, Chun was quoted as saying. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies blamed a flash flood for displacing more than 23,000 people in a North Korean province bordering China. ""The whole city of Sinuiju with its 350,000 residents is without piped drinking water at the moment because the main pumping station was inundated,"" said Henk Schipper, Red Cross water and sanitation delegate in North Korea. In August, nearly 260,000 people in northeastern China and North Korea fled their homes as heavy rains caused the Yalu River to overflow its banks, state news outlets in those countries reported Sunday. Tensions between North Korea and its southern neighbor have escalated since a May report from Seoul blamed North Korea for the sinking of a South Korean warship in March. The report, whose findings have been endorsed by the United States, alleged that a North Korean sub sank the ship, the Cheonan, with a torpedo, killing 46 sailors. North Korea denies it was responsible for the sinking.","The Red Cross is South Korea's channel for aid to North Korea .

"(CNN) -- It should come as no surprise that even after consumer-friendly bank reform it costs more than ever to use your own money. A veritable credit card fee frenzy over the past decade meant many banks could easily offer free checking and other perks, subsidized by the big fees generated elsewhere. (A checking account costs the typical bank $100 to $200 to set up and maintain.) But now that these fees have been tamed by new rules, fees are rising elsewhere. New analysis by Bankrate.com shows fewer banks offer free checking and the costs associated with your bank account are rising. You can be charged by the bank to hold your money for you, if you don't have a minimum balance. You can be charged to take your own money out of an ATM. And you will still pay if you bounce a check or overdraw your account with a debit card. Average ATM fees are up 5 percent, to an all-time high of $2.33, and the average out-of-network charge to use an ATM for another bank is $1.41. Overdraft fees rose another 3 percent to $30.47 and the cost to maintain a checking account rose on average to $13.04 a month -- that's the cost for not keeping the minimum in an interest bearing account. The typical consumer pays $620 year in unnecessary and avoidable fees, Bankrate's senior financial analyst Greg McBride figures. Here's how to avoid paying the bank for the use of YOUR money: . Never use an out of network ATM machine . Walk or drive the extra distance. It is literally the easiest money you can save in your budget. Avoid overdrafts . Avoiding one overdraft a month saves you $360 a year. There are new rules to protect you from the most egregious overdraft fees, but make no mistake, you can't spend money you don't have in the account. Do not opt in for overdraft protection for your debit card. Unfortunately, the consumers getting dinged by overdraft fees tend to be what I call ""fee-quent fliers."" Bank of America reported last week that 10 percent of its customers generate 70 percent of its overdraft fees. Strive to not be a fee-quent flier. Shop around for bank accounts . If you have a low balance and your bank will charge you a few dollars for dipping below a minimum level, check out community banks and credit unions. Bottom line, don't pay to use your own money.","Fewer banks offer free checking, according to new analysis by Bankrate.com .

"Las Vegas, Nevada (CNN)  -- Nevada Republican Senate candidate Sharron Angle just might be the Tea Party's biggest gamble yet. A staunch conservative with a history of making bold and sometimes controversial comments, Angle insists her comments have been taken out of context in her campaign to oust Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid in upcoming midterm congressional elections. ""I'll be a mainstream senator,"" said Angle. A grandmother of 10 children who secured the backing of Tea Party leaders on her way to winning the GOP nomination for U.S. Senate, Angle has been both praised and criticized for her views. In past remarks during the campaign, Angle has said Social Security and Medicare should be phased out. She's also advocated the elimination of the Departments of Education and Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency and the IRS. Angle established herself as an ardent conservative during her six-year tenure in the Nevada State Assembly. ""Sharron Angle was the Tea Party before the Tea Party existed,"" Nevada political journalist Jon Ralston said of the Republican, adding she was a ""far right"" candidate. While Angle's controversial stances have bolstered her standing with the Tea Party, they have provided fodder for Democrats, who perceive the 60-year-old Tea Party candidate a threat to one of Washington's most prominent Democrats. In response, Reid has called his opponent ""too extreme"" in TV ads airing across the state, and even President Obama weighed in at a July event for Reid, saying, ""[Angle] favors an approach that's even more extreme than the Republicans we've got in Washington. That's saying something."" When CNN caught up with Angle at one of her Las Vegas, Nevada, campaign stops, she complained some of her more controversial statements had been taken out of context. ""As you speak, as we're conversationally speaking, sometimes when you pick out words, they're not the best words you could have used,"" she told CNN in a rare one-on-one interview. ""When taken out of context, you can make anybody look like they don't know what they're talking about,"" she said. ""It's a little hard to take out of context when they say they want to phase out Social Security,"" Reid responded to CNN. ""Her words are what she is. My words are what I am. So I don't think you can run from what you say and what you do."" Angle has also made some contentious comments on friendly conservative talk radio programs, which have bolstered her detractors' views that she is an extremist. In a January appearance on the Reno, Nevada-based Bill Manders Show, Angle implied the purpose of the Second Amendment right to bear arms might be to keep the federal government in check. ""I'm hoping that we're not getting to Second Amendment remedies. I hope that the vote will be the cure for the Harry Reid problems,"" she said, generating a slew of questions about her intent. When CNN asked about Angle's ominous-sounding warning, she laughed off the notion she was promoting an armed revolution. ""Those are not the issues people are concerned about. They're concerned about our economy, our homes, our jobs. That's what people are concerned about,"" she said, not offering an explanation of her remarks. CNN also asked Angle about her affirmation of the same conservative host's observation that there are ""home-born, homegrown"" enemies operating in Congress. ""The larger focus of that conversation is what has happened domestically here and our country for the last 18 months,"" Angle said, pointing out that no names were mentioned during the conversation, and again not addressing directly the intent of her statement. It's easy to see how Angle's staunch views appeal to the Tea Party, but even some of her fellow Nevada Republicans are wary that she is too conservative. In an interview with CNN affiliate KLAS, Reno Mayor Bob Cashell, who is a Republican from Angle's hometown, called Angle ""an ultra-right winger"" who he will not support in November. Another prominent Nevada Republican, former Rep. Barbara Vucanovich described Angle as ""rigid"" in her beliefs in an interview to the Las Vegas Review Journal. ""She's a very difficult person. She's very positive in her own way, but when you're elected you have to work for everybody,"" Vucanovich told the newspaper. But it's not just politicians who are concerned. In a poll released by the Las Vegas Review Journal on August 27, 71 percent of Nevada Republicans admit they would prefer to see a different Republican candidate take on Reid. Of those Republicans who voted for Angle in the primary election, 66 percent now say they'd like another nominee. Reid fares better with his own party, but is still far from a perfect candidate in the eyes of Nevada voters, many of whom see the high-profile Democrat as a Washington insider who brokered deals infamously known as the ""Cornhusker Kickback"" and ""The Louisiana Purchase"" to pass health care reform. ""Harry Reid is the most negatively viewed person in this state and there is a hardened opposition to him. I think Sharron Angle could be arrested for a felony tomorrow and still get percent 40 percent of the vote,"" Ralston told CNN. That explains why, despite Angle's controversial candidacy, polls show Nevada voters evenly split between the ""extremist"" challenger and the ""establishment"" senator. The high-profile race is considered a statistical dead heat where, even in the gambling capital of the world, there is no odds-on favorite, making it a bellwether of just how influential the Tea Party might be in future elections.","Tea Party favorite Sharron Angle insists her words have been taken out of context .

"(CNN) -- Fantasia Barrino did not deny an alleged relationship with a married man, but a statement from her manager said the singer-actress did not wreck his marriage. A North Carolina woman, in a child custody case filing, charged that Barrino carried on a year-long affair with her husband, Antwaun Cook, who is the father of her two young children. Paula Cook alleged her husband and the ""American Idol"" winner ""have at times recorded their illicit sexual activity,"" although her lawyer stopped short of explaining whether a sex video existed. The woman is seeking full custody of her sons, 2 and 6, along with child support, alimony, the family home and a car. The suit was filed last week in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina. ""Fantasia is certain that she is not responsible for the deterioration of the Cook's marriage,"" manager Brian Dickens said in a statement to CNN Monday. Barrino has said in past interviews that she was friends with a married man, but she has consistently denied there was a sexual relationship. Photos of Barrino and Cook together, including on a personal watercraft and also walking hand-in-hand, have circulated on the internet for months. Paula Cook's petition said her husband ""frequents bars, restaurants, nightclubs and the like"" with Barrino. She accused her husband of enjoying ""the lavish benefits associated with the high-profile relationship."" ""Ms. Barrino flew defendant/husband to places such as Atlanta, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and Barbados"" where he ""attended celebrity parties, concerts, photo shoots and award shows with Ms. Barrino."" The petition, which said the couple separated in June, described a phone conversation in July in which Barrino allegedly told the wife: ""He don't want you. ... Maybe the next time that you get a husband, you'll know how to keep him. ... That's why he is here with me."" While Barrino is not directly involved in the current legal case, North Carolina is one of only a few states that allow a spouse to sue a third party who interferes with a marriage for alienation of affection. ""Fantasia will weather this storm with the dignity and grace that she has exemplified throughout a life in which she has repeatedly overcome obstacles and challenges,"" Barrino's manager said. The High Point, North Carolina, native has enjoyed a successful recording and acting career since winning ""American Idol's"" third season.","A North Carolina woman's petition claims her husband had a year-long affair with Barrino .

"(CNN)  -- Roger Federer cruised into the quarterfinals of the Toronto Masters tournament with a 7-6 6-3 win over Frenchman Michael Llodra on Thursday. It earns the former world number one a rematch with Czech Tomas Berdych, who beat him in the quarterfinals to end his reign as Wimbledon champion in a massive upset. Earlier, seventh seed Berdych continued his fine form this season with a hard-fought 6-3 6-7 6-4 win over Alexandr Dolgopolov of Ukraine. Federer, who is playing his first tournament since the grass court grand slam, showed he is returning to best form after an early scare. Llodra went up an early break in the first set, but once Federer drew level it was one-way traffic. The third seed claimed the subsequent tiebreak seven points to two and early breaks of service in the second put him in command. Federer, who has slipped behind Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic in the rankings, will be intent on revenge when he faces his Wimledon nemesis. ""Playing Berdych is going to bring back memories, some not so nice,"" he told Sky Sports. Defending champion Andy Murray survived a second set slump to record a 6-2 0-6 6-3 victory over 15th seed Gael Monfils. Scot Murray was in total command in the opener but his French opponent hit back with a vengeance as he whitewashed him in the second. But fourth seed Murray regained his composure and with the injury-hit Monfils receiving treatment for a shoulder problem in the decider, he eased to victory. Washington champion David Nalbandian is also into the last eight, claiming the scalp of fifth seed Robin Soderling as he claimed his 11th straight victory on the ATP Tour, a personal record. The Argentine won 4-6 6-4 6-1 as he broke the Swede's powerful service six times, sweeping through the decider after falling a set behind. Sixth seed Nikolay Davydenko is also out, the Russian beaten 6-3 6-2 by unseeded Frenchman Jeremy Chardy. World number one Rafael Nadal was playing his last 16 match later Thursday in the night session, taking on giant South African Kevin Anderson.","Roger Federer reaches quarterfinals of Rogers Cup tournament in Toronto .

"(CNN) -- Four months after a criminal investigation began into the disappearance of an Oregon boy, officials continue to ask the public for leads and tips. Thursday marks Kyron Horman's 8th birthday. Desiree Young, Kyron's biological mother, said she will celebrate the birthday by releasing red balloons outside a church in Medford, Oregon. His stepmother, Terri Horman, said she dropped him off at Skyline Elementary School on the morning of June 4. She has been the subject of intense scrutiny for several months. In divorce filings, her ex-husband, Kaine Horman, said he believes that Terri Horman ""is involved"" in the boy's disappearance. Court documents also allege Terri Horman attempted to hire a man to kill her husband. Meanwhile, Skyline Elementary began its first day of classes for the year on Tuesday with additional security measures to protect the children and staff. In a letter to parents, Principal Ben Keefer said video cameras will be installed this weekend at Skyline. ""These cameras will show external views of the building as well as the main hallway,"" he wrote. Also, security procedures will be reviewed to ensure they are effective, he added. Tributes, messages, posters and cards that adorned a ""Wall of Hope"" for Kyron were moved from school property to a fence outside a nearby fire station, said the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office. ""We're happy that the fire district can provide this service to the community,"" said Tualatin Valley Fire & Rescue Communications Officer Brian Barker.

"(CNN) -- A drive to turn China's only tropical island into a golfing haven is causing uproar among environmental groups. Luxury golf resorts are springing up in all corners of Hainan as the local government steps up its campaign to transform the island into the Hawaii of the east. The biggest project is Mission Hills Hainan, a vast undertaking that when finished will have at least 10 courses and cover an area nearly one and a half times the size of Manhattan. Environmentalists are alarmed by the potentially damaging effects of golf course construction on an island featuring rainforests, mountains, volcanoes and more than 300 endangered species. ""Where does this begin and where does it end?"" said Jonathan Smith, chief executive of the Golf Environment Organization, a non-governmental organization aimed at promoting sustainable golf. ""What level of economic development can Hainan sustain while still having functioning ecosystems? You have to set a threshold on the level of development that can hit a region otherwise you will simply destroy its natural and cultural aspects,"" Smith told CNN. Golf development in Hainan has gone into overdrive since January, when the state announced plans to make the island an international tourist destination by 2020, sparking a full-scale property boom. Clearwater Bay Golf Club is planning to compliment its three courses with a six or seven star hotel, while Yalong Bay Golf Club has bought the land to open a second course. But those developments are dwarfed by the scale of Mission Hills, where there are three courses, a 525-room hotel, 11 restaurants and plans for three conference rooms, three shopping malls and a spa. In October, Hollywood actors including Hugh Grant and Matthew McConaughey will join multiple major winners Greg Norman and Nick Faldo for the Mission Hills Star Trophy, with the winner set to scoop $1.28 million. The sheer scale of development has also raised eyebrows at international environmental activists Greenpeace. ""Because Hainan is known for its vast and dense rainforest, it is very important to China and to the world,"" Yi Lan, a forest campaigner for Greenpeace China, told CNN. ""Any large-scale construction of golf courses would damage the local ecosystem. ""We are very concerned about the rapid development of golf courses in Hainan and we think the local government should take strong measures to ensure the golf projects do not damage the local ecosystems."" Dan Washburn, a China-based journalist who has visited the Mission Hills complex in Hainan, says although the development mostly occupies an area designated as wasteland, fruit trees have been uprooted and local residents displaced from their homes. He told CNN: ""I met with the head of a local environmental group who thought he had secured rights to open up a forest park on part of the land. They had worked for years to get approvals from the government and local village groups. ""Then, all of a sudden, they were told their plans had been shelved. They soon found out the reason why. It was because of the Mission Hills project."" Mission Hills, which also owns a massive 12-course golf complex in Shenzhen on the Chinese mainland, say their Hainan project has created thousands of jobs and was subject to stringent environmental impact assessments. ""Mission Hills has always strived to balance economic benefits to the community with proper stewardship of the environment,"" Dr Ken Chu, Group Executive Vice Chairman and Group Chief Executive Officer of the Mission Hills Group, told CNN by email. ""By incorporating low-density development with vast open-space greenbelts, our current project in Haikou has transformed a barren, lava-rock landscape into an economically productive community."" Their claims are backed up by the local government, with spokesman Mr. Zhao telling CNN that the location of the complex followed ""careful"" investigation. ""Therefore, the project will not pollute the environment,"" he said. But those statements are not enough to pacify environmental groups, with Greenpeace vowing to investigate the case. ""You have to say that the Mission Hills developments have been high-impact in environmental terms,"" says Smith. ""You can't deny that when there's the level of earth-shifting and movement of land form that there has been in the previous development. It's large-scale and each development couldn't really be defined as light touch. ""Then you have the longer-term concerns over where does the water come from, where does the energy come from? Is it all fossil fuels? How much energy is required to desalinate or treat the sewage water?"" Shane Templeton, a golf course consultant on Hainan for six years, says the sport can bring huge benefits to the island's economy if it is kept in balance with the local infrastructure. ""Golf is great for Hainan and it's a vehicle for bringing a lot of foreign exchange, but it's got to be done carefully and within reason,"" he told CNN. ""I don't know who is regulating these people. You don't want 50 golf courses but no buses and no sewage systems -- it's got to grow together with everything."" Smith wants to see an end to the clandestine culture surrounding golf course construction in China. ""What we would like to see is more transparency,"" he said. ""We would like to see the government's plans for the levels of development in Hainan clearly depicted so that people can understand the levels and type of development that are likely to take place in such regions."" ""There comes a point, particularly on an island setting, where too much development puts too much pressure on the natural resources, and the cultural heritage and the landscape of that particular region.""","Hainan is at the center of an environmental row over development of golf courses .

"(CNN) -- Anjali Thakur is living in fear in India. She is a mother afraid for her son. ""We are all having sleepless nights,"" Thakur says. Sourabh Sharma -- one of the Indian students attacked in Melbourne. Her son isn't in a war zone or even a country known to be dangerous. He is a student in Melbourne, Australia. ""Three years back when we sent him,"" she says, ""it was one of the safest places for the children to go."" The Australian government says it is still safe but a spate of vicious attacks on Indian students in recent weeks has parents like Thakur and hundreds of students shaken and angry. From Melbourne to Victoria to Sydney Indian students say they are targets of racially motivated attacks. At least 10 Indian students have been attacked over the past month, the most severe case left an Indian student in a coma, another student was stabbed in the stomach, and a third left with a nasty black eye. So far more than a dozen arrests have been made. Australia authorities say they don't believe the attacks and robberies are racially motivated but instead crimes of opportunity against soft targets: students who typically travel alone at night on public transportation. But hundreds of Indian students see it differently. They have reacted with protests in at least three Australian cities. Police say at one point Indian students decided to take the law into their own hands and retaliate which has been condemned in both India and Australia. The situation has gotten so much attention Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has made several statements on the matter, insisting the attacks are isolated incidents. In an interview on Australian radio he said: ""Every city has violence, let's put this into perspective, and Australia I'm advised on the statistics is one of the safest countries in the world for international students."" In India though the perception of a safe Australia has been shattered partly due to the widespread publicity of the recent cases. The story has been front page news for days while local television media has been going with breaking news every time it receives a report of an Indian student attacked anywhere in Australia. Political tension has even bubbled up between India and Australia with India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh addressing the attacks and asking Australia does something to safeguard India's young people. Australia has responded with a 10-point action plan to help safeguard students. A helpline has also been set up. As for Anjali Thakur, she says her son has lived in Australia for three years and never experienced violence; in fact she says he didn't even know about the attacks in Melbourne where he lives until she called him to warn him. But Thakur has been watching the news in India and seeing a totally different picture of Australia. ""It's a lovely beautiful peaceful country,"" Thakur says, ""but now what you see on TV and what you hear, that's a total contrast to what we know of Australia."" The Thakur family has responded by refusing to let the youngest son study in Australia and keeping their eldest son from enrolling in a master's program at his university. If that kind of sentiment spreads, it could have serious consequences for Australia's $12.6 billion-a-year education export industry. More than 80,000 students from India study in Australia. ""Any parent will tell you,"" Thakur says, ""they are not going to send a child for the best education in the world at the cost of his life.""","Spate of attacks on Indian students in Australia makes headlines in India .

"(CNN)  -- Top seed Rafael Nadal made short work of fellow Spaniard Fernando Verdasco on Thursday to advance to the semifinals of the U.S. Open with a 7-5, 6-3, 6-4 win. Mikhail Youzhny now stands between Nadal and his first final at Flushing Meadows after the Russian edged out Stanislas Wawrinka in five sets, 3-6, 7-6, 3-6, 6-3, 6-3. Five-times winner Roger Federer will face Novak Djokovic of Serbia in the other semifinals after the Swiss second seed battled high winds to beat fifth seed Robin Soderling in a repeat of their 2009 quarterfinal 6-4, 6-4, 7-5. Nadal started slowly on a cold and windy evening in New York and dropped his serve for the first time in the tournament early in the first set. But he finished the match with just 16 unforced errors to complete a routine victory over eighth seed Verdasco. ""It's great news for me, especially this year without losing a set,"" Nadal said. ""Today I played, for the conditions, I think I played a great match against very difficult opponent like Fernando. ""So for me, to be in semifinals is amazing. But I have to keep going and keep playing better if I really want to have a chance to be in the final."" Federer's victory reaffirmed his dominance in the tournament; the five-time champion has not dropped a set in New York, and remains on course for a record-breaking sixth U.S. Open crown. Federer beat world number three Djokovic in the 2007 final at Flushing Meadows and in the semifinals the past two years. ""Here we go again,"" Federer said in comments carried by AFP. ""He has been playing great. He's hungry to make a breakthrough. It's going to be a tough match."" Home hopes distant ahead of U.S. Open . Soderling's only victory over Federer came in the French Open quarterfinals this year, ending the Swiss champion's run of 23 consecutive grand slam semifinals. Federer saved three break points in the second game of the match and another in the sixth before snatching the set by converting his first break point. The Swiss broke again in the fifth game of the second before closing out for a 2-0 lead. Soderling broke in the eighth game of the third and served for the set, but Federer came roaring back with four straight games to surge into the last four. ""I just feel happy that I played a good match under tough circumstances against a player who's really hard to beat these days, especially on the hard courts,"" Federer told the U.S. Open website. ""It really favors his game, and he's had a wonderful run the last couple of years. For me, this is obviously a big victory.""

"(CNN)  -- Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has been charged with improper conduct by the English Football Association (FA) after his angry disagreement with a match official following his side's 1-1 draw against Sunderland. Arsenal appeared set for three points at the Stadium of Light on Saturday as they led 1-0 deep into injury time. But the home side equalized through Darren Bent 15 seconds after the end of the allotted four minutes of extra time. Clearly furious, Wenger confronted fourth official Martin Atkinson and appeared to shove him in the back. The Frenchman faces an £8,000 ($12, 440) fine and one-match touchline ban if he accepts the charge under the FA's new fast-track disciplinary process. ""Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has been charged with using insulting and/or abusive language and behavior amounting to improper conduct,"" a statement on the FA's official website read. Wenger has until Thursday September 23 to respond to the charge and could opt for the case to be heard by a disciplinary panel. On Saturday he was unrepentant about his actions. ""Take the pictures and look at it. I complained to nobody,"" Wenger insisted in the post-match press conference. Meanwhile, Cesc Fabregas, who scored Arsenal's freak opener at the Stadium of Light, but then limped off injured could make a quick return to action. The Spain World Cup hero told his official Twitter account: ""Good news on my injury. ""I have some fluid but nothing bad in the muscle. I hope I can be playing in two weeks.""

"(CNN) -- A new study released Thursday suggests mammograms might not be as effective in reducing deaths from breast cancer in women over 50 as previously thought. The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, analyzed data from more than 40,000 women with breast cancer. It concluded the availability of mammography screening corresponded with a reduction in the rate of death from breast cancer, ""but the screening itself accounted for only about a third of the total reduction."" The study involved women in Norway between ages 50 and 69. Researchers from Norway and Harvard University compared the death rates from breast cancer in four groups: one group of women from 1996 through 2005 who were living in Norwegian counties with screening; another group in the same time period who were living in counties without screening; and two similar groups from 1986 through 1995. ""Among women in the nonscreening group, there was an 18 percent reduction in the rate of death from breast cancer, as compared with the preceding 10-year period, presumably as a result of increased breast-cancer awareness, improved therapy, and the use of more sensitive diagnostic tools,"" the findings state. ""Among women in the screening group, there was a 28 percent reduction in mortality from breast cancer during the same period. Thus, the relative reduction in mortality that was causally related to the screening program alone was 10 percent."" The publication notes that in 2002, the World Health Organization concluded that mammography screening for women between ages 50 and 69 reduced the death rate from breast cancer by 25 percent. Researchers said challenges in measuring the effectiveness of mammography screenings include increases in breast-cancer awareness and advances in treatment.","Study: The difference in mortality related to a screening program alone was 10 percent .

"(CNN) -- More than 7,200 children in Gaza dribbled their way to an unofficial record Thursday night at an airport in Rafah, officials from a United Nations agency said.

""Children of Gaza once again show they have fantastic abilities, fantastic talent, and all we need to do is help them to realize their potential."" Relief agency spokesman Chris Gunness said the mass-dribbling record still needs to be verified by the Guinness Book of World Records. Organized by the U.N. agency, the Great Gaza Global Bounce is part of the annual Summer Games program that provides recreational activities for more than a quarter of million children across Gaza. Now in its fourth year, the games are the largest recreation program for Gaza's children and are designed to bring a positive summer experience for many of the children who have been affected by poverty and unrest. Children in Gaza, who often have few outlets for recreation outside of school, attend the camps to engage in sports, arts and craft, theater, and drama activities. The record attempt wasn't the first for the children of the U.N.-backed summer camp. Last year, Summer Games participants set the record for the number of kites flown simultaneously.

"Phoenix, Arizona (CNN) -- Jorge Ramos has been the face of Univision's News broadcast for 24 years. The program's estimated audience of more than 2 million viewers exceeds most English language news broadcasts. Ramos is also a best-selling author of 10 books. His latest is ""A Country for All: An Immigrant Manifesto."" CNN spoke to him in Phoenix where he was covering Arizona's controversial immigration law, SB1070: . CNN: You came to the United States as an immigrant yourself. What is your story? Jorge Ramos: Well I was working as a journalist in Mexico, and one day when I was very young out of college they censored one of the stories that I was doing on the president of the country. And back then I was very idealistic -- and I still am -- and I decided to quit. I quit my job in Mexico. I sold my car for $2,000, got a student visa and came to the United States. And it was supposed to be for only one year, that was January 2, 1983, and that year has become 27 years. So this country gave me the opportunities that my country of origin, Mexico, couldn't give me. CNN: How were you able to stay in this country on a student visa? JR: The student visa became a work permit. With the work permit I started working as a reporter in Los Angeles and then after being a few years in Los Angeles I became at 28 the anchorman for Univision news. CNN: You have written 10 books in your time here, often focusing on Latinos. But why immigration? Why now? JR: It's a book on the urgent need to have immigration reform. As we can see what happened in Arizona [the overturning of parts of SB 1070] it's a step in the right direction for Latinos and immigrants, but it's simply not enough. Things are exactly the same as two weeks ago or two months ago or two years ago or even 20 years ago because we still have 11 million people in the U.S. without any rights whatsoever. It's really incredible that the most powerful country in the world is treating 11 million people as second-class citizens or second-class human beings. CNN: You're getting a lot of criticism with this book not for criticizing the conservatives who are targeting immigrants, rather for accusing President Obama of breaking a campaign promise. Please explain this. JR: Yea, when Barack Obama was running for president he told Univision in an interview that he was going to have an immigration bill during his first year in office. It was an important promise because back then Barack Obama was trying to the get the Democratic nomination against Hilary Clinton. Hillary Clinton had promised that she was going to do it during the first 100 days. Anyway, Latinos believed Barack Obama; 67 percent of Latinos voted for Barack Obama and at the end President Barack Obama didn't keep his promise. He broke a promise. So, Obama broke his promise, Democrats don't have the political will to push for immigration reform right now and Republicans are missing in action during immigration. Nobody is really doing anything for immigrants right now. CNN: As an anchor for one of the largest Spanish-speaking news networks in the world, have you been able to get the Democratic leadership or the president to tell you what is behind the delay? JR: I think it's politics, simply politics. Democrats are very scared of losing the elections in November. The Democrats are afraid of losing control of the House of Representatives, if not the Senate. So they are not willing to push their luck right now on immigration and since immigrants, especially undocumented immigrants, can't vote there is really nothing to gain. But it was a campaign promise. Democrats were, most of them, for immigration reform and right now when they see the political wings are going the other way they are doing nothing. Because of the lack of action and leadership in Washington, that's why things like this are happening in Arizona. Other states realize that nothing is happening in Washington and they're taking immigration into their own hands. It's wrong, but that's what they're doing. CNN: Let's talk about the Republican Party at the national level. There's a movement within Christian Republicans, many of whom are Latino, who are trying to promote a ""Not Arizona but not Amnesty"" position. Is the Republican Party listening to them? JR: I don't think honestly that the Republican Party is listening to them. The Republican Party has to make peace with Latinos, otherwise they're going to keep on losing election after election after election. Latinos will become the majority in this country in less than 100 years. We won't be here to see it, but without the Hispanic vote, no one can make it to the White House. If Republicans don't make peace with Latinos, Texas is going to become a blue state and Republicans are going to keep on losing elections. They don't get the fact that immigration is the most important symbolic issue for Latinos. Other issues are more important jobs, education, health care, but immigration is the most important issue. If Republicans don't get it, they are going to keep on losing the Hispanic vote. CNN: Millions of Spanish-speaking people living in America watch Univision. During the SB1070 story when you were in Phoenix at the State Capitol, you were surrounded by hundreds of people watching your live shots. What do your viewers want in the way of immigration reform? JR: It's very simple. They want to be legal in this country. They know that they are not criminals. They know that they are not terrorists, yet they're being blamed for the crime in this country. Those who are criticizing them, they're completely wrong. Crime is down in all the United States. Most immigrants are not terrorists or criminals. They pay taxes. They create jobs.

"(CNN) -- The National Football League has sent a memo to all 32 of its teams, reminding players and league employees that female reporters should be treated professionally and with respect. The note comes on the heels of news that the New York Jets team is investigating allegations of harassment by team members toward television sports reporter Ines Sainz. The memo cites the NFL's Media Relations Playbook, which states that ""by law, women must be granted the same rights to perform their jobs as men. Please remember that women reporters are professionals and should be treated as such."" Among other things, the playbook stresses that ""it is important to you and this organization that you present yourself to the media in a manner and style in which you yourself would like to be received and treated."" The memo also notes that ""barring individual members of the regularly accredited media ... for what is perceived as 'unfair coverage' or any similar reason is not permitted."" It is still unclear what exactly happened when Sainz, from the Mexican network TV Azteca, entered the Jets locker room last Saturday after practice but Sainz told CNN's Rick Sanchez on Monday that from the moment she entered, she felt all eyes were on her. ""I feel [a] little uncomfortable because evidently it is not easy to be in the locker room and hear and notice that everybody is speaking about you,"" Sainz said. CNN was not able to contact anyone else in the locker room at the time but Sainz said that a female colleague took her aside and expressed concern and embarrassment for the situation she was in. But Sainz said she was just trying to focus on her job, and not the joking and talking going on behind her. ""But I really know that she heard something that I didn't hear, and the rest of the media that was inside heard things that I didn't hear,"" Sainz told CNN. The Association of Women in Sports and Media spoke out Monday on Sainz' behalf, calling for a sharp rebuke. ""If Jets players, coaches and staff allegedly involved in the incident are found to have acted in unprofessional and harassing behavior toward Ms. Sainz, we expect and demand reprimand and punishment by the NFL and Jets,"" the association said in a statement. The Jets released a statement on Sunday saying, ""We will continue to work with the league to gather the facts and take any appropriate steps necessary to maintain a respectful environment for the media."" Sainz confirmed in her interview on CNN's ""Rick's List"" that Jets team owner Woody Johnson called her personally to stress that all Jets members are expected to act professionally and to extend courtesy to members of media regardless of gender. Sainz told CNN that she accepted the apology from Johnson and that she also made a statement to the NFL about the incident. Although Sainz at first seemed surprised by the attention she was garnering, she told CNN that she does not believe this type of behavior is acceptable. ""I think that it's not good that these kinds of things happen and it mustn't happen anymore,"" Sainz told CNN. ""Everyone knows that a woman or a man deserves the same treatment in the locker room."" CNN's Chris Kokenes and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report .","The NFL is reminding players and other league employees that women journalists should be treated with respect .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Last year, downtown Atlanta lost a convention to another Southern city because the visiting group perceived the other city as ""greener"" than Atlanta. The loss propelled Holly Elmore into action. Hotel food waste is diverted from Atlanta landfills, turned into compost soil, which is then sold to urban gardens. ""Environmental practices are fast becoming a strong consideration in business decisions,"" explains the Green Foodservice Alliance founder. Elmore teamed up with Atlanta Recycles and Laura Turner Seydel -- eco-awareness consultant and an Atlanta native -- to create the South's first Zero Waste Zone. First stop: The downtown Atlanta convention district, where the EPA estimates hundreds of thousands of tons of ""waste"" are sent to landfills -- ""waste"" that could be recycled into reusable products. If it grows, it goes . In 2008, the Hyatt Regency Atlanta served an average of 8,143 meals per week, a total of 423,433 meals in a single year. Imagine the ""waste"" that was sent to rot and pollute the overflowing landfill.  Watch how the project saves landfill space and grows food » . The hotel already recycled common goods such as plastic and glass, but now every little bit that is able to be reused, is. The food residuals are organic matter that when sent to landfills actually formed into dangerous greenhouse gases. Now that the Hyatt is part of the ZWZ, an estimated 928,000 pounds of residual food product will be diverted from the landfill and instead be turned into valuable compost. Every single plate returning from the dining area is scraped clean into the compost containers -- berries, salad, meat and bones -- everything. Excess food, in accordance with the Good Samaritan Food Donation Act, is donated to the Atlanta Community Food Bank, which aids in feeding the city's hungry. Even spent grease from frying is captured in bins and then suction-collected and turned into bio-fuel. The full circle effect . Grease into gas. The grease is transformed into commercially available biodiesel fuel, now selling for $2.29 a gallon at a pump for any engine that runs on diesel. ""We use only locally collected used fryer oils ... By sourcing this way, we avoid issues related to the food versus fuel debate, and issues surrounding land use change and deforestation ... we make a local fuel in the most sustainable way,"" explains Refuel Biodiesel program manager Robert Del Bueno. With Chick-fil-a and Emory University, Del Bueno's group collects their fryer oils, converts them into biodiesel and supplies the biodiesel back to them for use in their produce trucks and bus fleets. Crumbs, compost, cabbage. Greenco Environmental collects the residual food from places like the Hyatt and blends that with wood and yard ""waste"" from tree companies, landscapers and municipalities. After 90 days, a high-quality organic compost is ready for landscapers, farmers and gardeners to fertilize their soil. ""We are running out of room on our planet with the amount of waste we produce,"" says Tim Lesko, founder and president of Greenco Environmental. ""Paper and food waste are the highest proportion of garbage in our landfills, and food waste composting is the next step in recycling in the U.S."" ""Due to land clearing, development and erosion, our soils have been stripped of their natural, beneficial nutrients,"" Lesko explains. Compost added to soil replenishes the nutrients and promotes plant growth. ""Adding compost to the soil dramatically increases its ability to hold water, aiding in water conservation,"" he adds. Eco-friendly Daron ""Farmer D"" Joffe then buys this soil and uses it in his urban gardens and at his Organic Garden Center. Farmer D believes ""good compost is an essential ingredient in organic gardening, as it rapidly improves the structure and vitality of the soil, thus increasing the health of the plants growing there, making them more resistant to disease, drought and pests."" ""Organic gardening helps foster healthy soils, clean water and nutritious food,"" he says. Farmer D closes the circle: ""If more people grew their own food and ate locally, it would greatly reduce the amount of fuel, chemicals and energy that are exhausted to put food on the table, while keeping money in the local economy and improving the quality of life for everyone."" Money does grow on trees . There also are direct financial benefits for Zero Waste Zone participants. ""In addition to our commitment to responsible, sustainable practices, recycling is just good business. Increasingly, our customers share our commitment to sustainability, and demand these efforts from the hotels where they choose to stay,"" says Randall Childers, senior director of engineering at the Hyatt Regency Atlanta. ""The economics of recycling are also good, with most of these efforts representing cost savings to our operation, or at least are cost-neutral. With respect to our food waste recycling, we expect to save $8,000 this year,"" Childers says. Reduce, reuse, recycle . Georgians dispose of more than 17 million tons of solid waste in municipal solid waste landfills per year, according to the Georgia Environmental Protection Division. Recoverable products (paper, organics, and plastics) make up 82 percent of the recyclable materials disposed in landfills, says the Georgia Department of Community Affairs. With the ZWZ, these tons of perfectly reusable products are effectively being recycled. What's next? Holly Elmore and the ZWZ crew hope to expand the program across the state and nation soon with the strong support of the federal Environmental Protection Agency.","Hotel now turns food scraps into compost rather than sending them to landfill .

"(CNN) -- More state restrictions on fishing in the Gulf of Mexico were lifted Monday as the fall shrimping season began, but efforts to permanently plug the ruptured BP oil well were delayed again. The worst oil spill in U.S. history has hobbled fishermen across the Gulf as federal and state authorities put much of its waters off-limits due to safety concerns. With the well capped on a temporary basis for a month, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration and the Gulf states have begun lifting those restrictions -- but Louisiana shrimpers like Anthony Bourgeoif say more needs to be done, and soon. ""It's open down over here with small shrimp, where it should be open over there where the big shrimp are,"" Bourgeoif told CNN. ""Can't make no money with no little shrimp, man."" Bourgeoif said he planned to go out, because ""I ain't made nothing since the BP spill."" But he was concerned that inspectors might find signs of oil in his catch and make him dump it. ""So why go out there and catch it if they're just going to be dumped, and I ain't going to make no money off it?"" he asked. ""I've got to make money. I've got four grandkids I'm raising, man."" Deborah Long, a spokeswoman for the Southern Shrimp Alliance, said it will likely take days to assess what impact the spill has had on the Gulf catch. And while some shrimpers are eager to get back out, many are still working for the well's owner, BP, which has hired many boats to skim oil off the surface and lay protective booms along the shorelines. And concerns about the long-term impact of the spill persisted with a new report from researchers at the University of South Florida, who reported that oil from the Deepwater Horizon spill may have settled to the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico further east than previously suspected -- and at levels toxic to marine life. Initial findings from a new survey of the Gulf conclude that dispersants may have sent droplets of crude to the ocean floor, where it has turned up at the bottom of an undersea canyon within 40 miles of the Florida Panhandle. The results are scheduled to be released Tuesday, but CNN obtained a summary of the initial conclusions Monday night. Plankton and other organisms at the base of the food chain showed a ""strong toxic response"" to the crude, and the oil could well up onto the continental shelf and resurface later, according to researchers. ""The dispersant is moving the oil down out of the surface and into the deeper waters, where it can affect phytoplankton and other marine life,"" said John Paul, a marine microbiologist at USF. The spill erupted April 20 with an explosion that sank the offshore drilling platform Deepwater Horizon. The blast killed 11 men and uncapped an undersea gusher that spewed an estimated 205 million gallons of oil into the Gulf before it was temporarily shut in July 15. Thad Allen, the federal government's point man in the Gulf, said Monday that attempts to permanently seal the well won't start until the latest potential problem is evaluated. Allen said engineers are now concerned about how to manage the risk of pressure in the annulus, a ring that surrounds the casing pipe at the center of the well shaft. The ""timelines won't be known until we get a recommendation on the course of action,"" Allen said. Scientists began new pressure tests last week to gauge the effects of the mud and cement poured into the well from above during the ""static kill"" procedure that started August 3. From those pressure readings, they believe that either some of the cement breached the casing pipe and leaked into the annulus, or cement came up into the annulus from the bottom. The scientists believe that process may have trapped some oil between the cement and the top of the well, inside the annulus. Now, given that new variable, they're trying to figure out how to safely maintain the pressure within the well before launching the ""bottom kill,"" a procedure aimed at sealing the well from below. Allen told reporters that when it comes to giving a green light to the ""bottom kill"" of the well through the nearby relief well, ""nobody wants to make that declaration any more than I do."" But the process ""will not start until we figure out how to manage the risk of pressure in the annulus."" ""We're using an overabundance of caution,"" he said. Allen said crews could remove the capping stack that sealed the oil in the well on July 15, then replace the well's blowout preventer with a new one stored on the nearby Development Driller II in the Gulf. Allen said a new blowout preventer would be ""rated at much higher pressure levels than the annulus."" The other option would require BP to devise a pressure-relief device for the current capping stack. Once crews get their marching orders, it will take them about 96 hours to prepare, drill the final 50 feet of a relief well and intercept the main well. Then, the bottom kill process of plugging the well from below would begin. BP acknowledged Monday that the disruption the oil spill has caused to lives across the Gulf coast has built up tension among residents.  In response, the company announced Monday it is providing a total of $52 million to five behavioral health support and outreach programs. BP released a statement saying it would give the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration $10 million; the Florida Department of Children and Families, $3 million; the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals, $15 million; and the departments of mental health in Mississippi and Alabama, $12 million each. ""We appreciate that there is a great deal of stress and anxiety across the region, and as part of our determination to make things right for the people of the region, we are providing this assistance now to help make sure individuals who need help know where to turn,"" said Lamar McKay, president of BP America and incoming leader of BP's Gulf Coast Restoration Organization.

"Washington (CNN) -- The District of Columbia public school system announced Friday that it is letting 226 employees go for poor performance under the education assessment system IMPACT. Another 76 employees will be terminated because of licensing issues, schools Chancellor Michelle Rhee said in a news release. Of the 302 employees who are losing their jobs, 241 are teachers, she said. ""Every child in a District of Columbia public school has a right to a highly effective teacher -- in every classroom of every school, of every neighborhood or every ward, in this city,"" Rhee said. Rhee said on CNN's ""John King, USA""  that she thought the cleanup was a long time coming. ""We want to get along with the union. We want to get along with this person or that person. We don't want to fire anyone,"" she said. ""But in the meantime, children have been done a disservice every single day. We have graduated a generation of Washingtonians who don't have the skills and knowledge that they need to be  productive members of society because our schools have failed them."" Rhee did not break down the number of teachers fired for poor performance versus licensing issues. Under the IMPACT program, teachers were judged on five classroom observation visits by principals and outside education experts. The system also rates teachers based on their students' achievement. In response to the firings, the Washington Teachers Union released the results of a membership study showing that ""a large majority of teachers believe that IMPACT is not a fair evaluation system."" Washington Teachers Union President George Parker said, ""It is evident from this survey that our members agree that IMPACT is a flawed instrument with many loopholes."" The union claims that teachers under the IMPACT system need clearer communication on expectations, among other things. The teachers union has no say in which evaluation system that the D.C. public school system chooses to use, and by contract, teachers can be let go for low evaluations. Parker added that the union plans to challenge the firings of about 81 of the teachers. Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, told CNN's Rick Sanchez that the IMPACT system needed more evaluation itself.. ""Everyone who teaches gets better with time and gets better with experience, just like ballplayers and others,"" she said. "" ... All we're saying is that if an evaluation system is thorough, competent, comprehensive, measures how we're doing as teachers and how students are learning, then it's fine,"" she said. ""But the thing is, in the whole year, we have raised, and the teachers have raised, lots and lots of different issues about the evaluation system, and the person who turned a blind eye to it was Michelle."" Rhee told King that she had heard the teacher's union say teachers with poor evaluations should have been given more time to improve. ""But the question that I ask to them is 'Whose children are we going to put in the classroom of ineffective teachers next year?' My two kids go to DCPS. I'm not willing to put my kids in those classrooms, and I don't think any parents anywhere in this city should be forced to make that decision,"" Rhee said. The 2009-10 school year was the first full year of implementation of the IMPACT program for the D.C. Public Schools. Also Friday, the district announced that it has notified 737 employees that if their performance doesn't improve, they will be terminated after the upcoming school year.","NEW: Schools chancellor Michelle Rhee says children are done ""a disservice"" by poor teachers .

"(CNN) -- It is a problem of massive plastic proportions -- a giant floating debris field, composed mostly of bits and pieces of plastic, in the northwest Pacific Ocean, about a thousand miles off the coast of California. Researchers recover nets from the Pacific Ocean on August 3, 2009. It's called the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and it covers a vast area of hundreds, maybe even thousands, of miles of open ocean. Now researchers are trying to learn more about the sea-bound trash zone and perhaps find answers to basic questions. A crew of scientists from the University of California's Scripps Institution of Oceanography has embarked on a three-week mission aboard the research vessel New Horizon, heading for the debris field to study it. The mission is not as straightforward as it sounds. ""There may be a misapprehension ... that if you got out there and stood on the middle of a deck you'd see nothing but plastic litter from horizon to horizon,"" said Robert Knox, deputy director for research at the Scripps Institution. ""It's relatively sparse, and you might or might not see something visible to the human eye at any particular location out there,"" Knox says. ""Certainly one does encounter pieces of plastic stuff that are big enough to see. But the other side of the puzzle is all the little bits and pieces of plastic that you can't even see unless you scoop up a sample of seawater and see what's in there."" ""I think it's a little misleading to think of it as a great big island that you could practically get out and walk on, but the point is it's a big area of ocean. So even a few pieces of plastic per square meter amounts to a lot of plastic when you add it up over this enormous ocean area."" There has been some previous research on this garbage field, but not much. It's been very poorly studied in a scientific sense. Major questions remain: . How how much stuff is there? What size is the stuff? Where is it distributed in the ocean, at the surface or at what depth? What does it do to the food chain, especially the small particles of plastic that may be ingested by smaller organisms at the bottom of the food chain? While the main focus of the Scripps mission is the impact of this plastic trash on marine life, researchers will gather information on a wide variety of issues. Here's what scientists do know: They know the size of this zone is huge, maybe as big as Texas. And they know that all the plastic accumulated in the patch has mostly broken down into smaller bits, floating just under the water's surface like confetti, basically a soupy mix of plastic-filled seawater that stretches for maybe thousands of miles. They know the garbage patch has been growing for many years, and scientists first became aware of the problem years ago when fisherman reported encountering widespread debris. They know there are other debris fields in other oceans of the world, but this one is the biggest. Rusty Brainard with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says this giant garbage patch, in addition to plastic, also contains huge masses of fishing nets, which destroys ecosystems around the Hawaiian Islands. But the plastic is really the toxic killer. While it slowly degrades, it turns into increasingly smaller bits of plastic. Seabirds mistake it for food and they dive down and eat it. Brainard says they find a lot of skeletons of seabirds on the Islands and ""their gut content is just filled with plastic."" Brainard says that has scientists wondering what other animals are eating this plastic. As the larger animals and marine life eat the smaller animals, this plastic eventually ends up in the human food supply, too. But even the size is of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is uncertain. ""It's not a hard and fast number. It's a little bit like a whirlpool on the surface of a river or a lake. You'd be hard-pressed to tell me where the edge is. All you know is that it's stronger in the middle than it is in the outer reaches. But it's an area of many hundreds of miles -- perhaps thousands -- in which the ocean currents tend to bring it together,"" according to Knox. NOAA has tracked the Great Pacific Garbage Patch movement to some degree. Scientists know it moves as much as a thousand miles north and south in the Pacific seasonally. And during warmer ocean periods, known as El Nino, it drifts even further south. A kind of large, clock-wise circulation of currents driven by the wind around the Pacific ocean basin causes the plastic and other garbage to mix together in convergence zones, forming this giant trash zone and making its movements comparable to a whirlpool. Researchers believe this enormous trash zone accumulated over many years from trash being dumped off boats and ocean-going ships, and from trash accumulated on beaches, where it eventually washed in the Pacific Ocean and into the huge zone. This study mission may even help scientists determine whether there's any way to clean up the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and, if so, the best way to do it. CNN's Ninette Sosa contributed to this report.","Researchers are trying to learn the effects of the plastic and debris on wildlife .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN)  -- Corey Haim seemed to be winning his battle against drug abuse in the weeks before his death, his manager and closest friend said Wednesday. The 1980s teen movie actor and heartthrob died early Wednesday after collapsing in the Los Angeles apartment he shared with his mother, authorities said. Haim was ""weaned down to literally zero medications"" in the last two weeks by an addiction specialist, manager Mark Heaslip said on HLN's ""Issues With Jane Velez-Mitchell."" The doctor ""put him on a new line of medications,"" Haim's longtime friend and frequent co-star Corey Feldman said on CNN's ""Larry King Live."" Feldman pleaded with people not to draw conclusions that Haim died from a drug overdose. He said that until the autopsy report is issued, ""nobody knows and nobody's going to know."" ""I know that there were symptoms that he was showing that expressed it could be a number of things,"" Feldman said. ""This could have been a kidney failure. This could have been a heart failure."" Heaslip said Haim's mother, Judy, told him ""there were no signs of him overdosing."" His death came as his career was picking up, with Haim booking ""movie after movie,"" Heaslip said. His latest film is set for release soon, he said. Haim ""really became a man"" in recent months as he helped his mother in her battle with cancer, Feldman said. ""He's been there for her, taking care of her, being responsible,"" he said. Haim, 38, was taken to Providence St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, California, early Wednesday, where he was pronounced dead at 2:15 a.m., Los Angeles County Deputy Coroner Ed Winter said. Haim was in the apartment he shared with his mother, Judy, when he ""became a little dizzy, he kind of went to his knees in the bedroom,"" Winter said. ""His mom assisted him in the bed. He became unresponsive."" His mother called paramedics to the apartment, which is between Hollywood Hills and Burbank, he said. Los Angeles Police Sgt. Frank Albarran said earlier that Haim's death appeared to be accidental and may have been because of an overdose. Haim had suffered flu-like symptoms for two days, the deputy coroner said . ""We found no illicit drugs; however, we did recover four of his prescription meds at the location,"" Winter said, adding he does not know what those drugs were. An autopsy, including toxicology tests, will be conducted Wednesday, Winter said. It is likely to be weeks before any conclusions are made public. The actor was under the care of his doctor, who visited him Tuesday night, as well as another doctor who specializes in treating addictions, Heaslip said. Feldman said he was angry about how Haim has been snubbed in recent years by the entertainment industry. He was broke, without a car and living in a month-to-month rental apartment with his mother, he said. ""We build people up as children, we put them on pedestals and then when we decide that they are not marketable anymore, we walk away from them,"" he said. Haim's most famous role was in the 1987 movie ""The Lost Boys,"" in which he appeared with Feldman. Haim played the role of a fresh-faced teenager whose brother becomes a vampire. In later years, the two friends, who appeared in eight movies together, struggled with drug abuse and went their separate ways. They reunited for a reality show, ""The Two Coreys,"" in 2007, but A&E Network canceled the program after slightly more than a year. In a 2007 interview on CNN's ""Larry King Live,"" Haim and Feldman discussed their battle with drugs. Feldman told King that he had gotten clean, but it took Haim longer. Haim called himself ""a chronic relapser for the rest of my life."" ""I think I have an addiction to pretty much everything,"" he said. ""I mean, I have to be very careful with myself as far as that goes, which is why I have a support group around me consistently."" iReport: Share your memories of Haim . In 2008, Feldman told People magazine that he would no longer speak to Haim until his former co-star got sober. In a clip from ""The Two Coreys,"" Feldman and his wife, along with two other former teen stars, called on Haim in an effort to get him to admit he needed help, the magazine said. The meeting followed an incident in which Haim, scheduled to film a cameo appearance in a direct-to-DVD sequel to ""The Lost Boys,"" appeared on the set ""clearly under the influence,"" People reported. Feldman told King on Wednesday that he renewed his contact with Haim in the past year because of the progress he made against his addiction. Haim was born December 23, 1971, in Toronto, Ontario, according to a biography on his Web site. He made his first television appearance in 1982 on the Canadian series ""The Edison Twins."" His first film role was in the 1984 American movie ""First Born."" Haim also won rave reviews for his title role in the 1986 film ""Lucas."" Film critic Roger Ebert said of him at the time, ""If he continues to act this well, he will never become a half-forgotten child star, but will continue to grow into an important actor.""

"(CNN)  -- When international supermodel Naomi Campbell took the witness stand Friday in the trial against Liberia's former President Charles Taylor, Western media outlets showered unprecedented attention on this largely ignored war crimes trial. But many witnesses besides Campbell have testified since the trial began in January 2008. Judges have heard accounts of bravery and fortitude by ordinary civilians whose limbs were amputated, who were raped or forced into slavery; stories of horrifying acts of wickedness by faction commanders and their fighters; and the unsavory involvement of outsiders, often business opportunists. These business leaders' willingness to seek profit in diamonds, timber, rubber or weapons on the back of the war is shocking. Yet despite the dramatic and horrifying nature of this testimony, the trial garnered only minimal Western media coverage. That is, until the trial took a surprising twist, with supermodel Naomi Campbell and actress Mia Farrow testifying about a dinner in South Africa that happened nearly 13 years ago. At that dinner, then-newly elected President Charles Taylor allegedly gave the supermodel a parcel of rough diamonds. The judges will ultimately determine what exactly happened that night and how it relates to Taylor's case. But the Campbell-Farrow-diamond saga might bring public attention to an issue that goes far beyond the celebrities and even the trial itself. The supermodel, perhaps unintentionally, said it best when she described the gift she received at that dinner in South Africa. She called them ""dirty little stones"" unfamiliar to her because she was used to seeing diamonds ""shiny and in a box."" Campbell's comment spoke not only of her relative naïvety, but of the troubling nexus between Western economies and some of the world's worst resource-based conflicts and most corrupt regimes, particularly in Africa. The wars in Liberia and Sierra Leone were perhaps the first and most vivid examples of the new nature of post-Cold War conflicts in Africa. The Liberian civil war and eventually the larger regional war involving four neighboring countries started on December 24, 1989, the day that some mark as the end of the Cold War. The old client patronage support system for belligerents quickly evaporated. Commercial entities and transnational organized criminal networks, often overlapping, filled the void, providing weapons and a market for resources that sustained military campaigns conducted by both governments and rebel forces. In Liberia, it was timber, rubber and gold. In Sierra Leone, it was diamonds. But the pattern was evident in other wars as well, whether it was diamonds, oil, timber, or even rare minerals like coltan, used in today's cell phones. Commentators in the West typically point to the corruption and human rights abuses of African leaders, as if this happens in isolation. But it is a two-way street. In nearly every armed conflict or instance of a highly corrupt regime coupled with some desired resource, a network of outsiders extending from organized criminal networks to reputable financial institutions facilitates and exacerbates some of the world's worst abuses. This is not simply about a few unsavory businessmen willing to make back-room deals. It is also about major international financial institutions that exercise little due-diligence as they oppose stricter transparency regulations. It's about major corporations that transact with shell companies representing criminal networks, or that make payments to off-budget bank accounts. In short, it involves the ""see no evil"" approach by some of the world's largest mineral extraction, oil and financial institutions. For the people of Sierra Leone and Liberia, Naomi Campbell's association with this whole affair is of little consequence. But it is a cruel reminder of another stark fact: In the years of war that engulfed both countries, not only were thousands of innocent lives lost and people maimed, not only were women and girls raped or made sex slaves, not only were children conscripted to fight, but the people's resources also were stolen out from under them and never returned. The diamond industry has given almost nothing back to Sierra Leone, despite the critical role diamonds played in the war.

"(CNET) -- An attack directed at the DNS provider for some of the Internet's larger e-commerce companies -- including Amazon, Wal-Mart, and Expedia -- took several Internet shopping sites offline Wednesday evening, two days before Christmas. Neustar, the company that provides DNS services under the UltraDNS brand name, confirmed an attack took place Wednesday afternoon, taking out sites or rendering them extremely sluggish for about an hour. A representative who answered the customer support line said the attacks were directed against Neustar facilities in Palo Alto and San Jose, California, and Allen Goldberg, vice president of corporate communications for Neustar, confirmed that at about 4:45 p.m. PST, ""our alarms went off."" Goldberg said the company received a disproportionately high number of queries coming into the system, and analyzed it as an attack. Neustar deployed ""a mitigation response"" within minutes of the attack, he said, and brought matters under control within an hour. The response limited the problems to Northern California, he said. In addition to the high-profile sites, dozens of smaller sites that rely upon Amazon for Web-hosting services were also taken down by the attack. Amazon's S3 and EC2 services were affected by the problems, according to Jeff Barr, Amazon's lead Web Evangelist, who retweeted a report to that effect without clarification and confirmed it in later tweets. For a brief period Wednesday evening, ""ultradns"" was the top search term on Google, likely as frantic technicians at Web sites attempted to figure out what was going on with their sites. Web sites need DNS providers to translate the character-based URLs that people can remember to the IP addresses that Web sites actually use to list themselves on the Internet. When a DNS provider is overwhelmed with malicious requests for IP addresses, the system can overload and prevent legitimate users from reaching their destinations. Amazon's Web Services Health Dashboard declared an all-clear around 6:40 p.m. PST, saying that DNS resolution had returned to normal. Amazon and several other big sites seemed to recover around 5:40 p.m., but some other sites continued to report problems until around 6 p.m. Needless to say, the timing of such an outage could not have been much worse, as holiday procrastinators rushed to make sure they could get one-day shipping for gifts to be delivered before Christmas Day on Friday. Wolf Austad, a CNET reader, wrote in around 5:00 p.m. PST Wednesday to report that a last-minute gift purchase for his wife from Amazon.com had gone awry. He later reported that his transaction was stored in Amazon.com's history once he was able to get back into the site. However, ""now I need to explain to my wife why she is getting her gift on the 26th,"" he wrote in an e-mail. UltraDNS suffered a similar attack earlier this year, which took out Amazon, Salesforce.com, and other sites. Goldberg described Wednesday's attack as smaller than that one, in that it affected fewer customers. However, Amazon is no small customer. Goldberg declined to comment on specific customers affected by the outage, and said Neustar had not yet determined the source of the attack. One expert thought the attack might have been more widespread. ""This was wider than just UltraDNS,"" said Bill Woodcock, research director at Packet Clearing House, which operates domain name servers and supports Internet exchange points around the globe. ""It's difficult to tell at this point how much is a DDoS attack and how much is collateral damage from the attack that is being felt in other ways,"" like a domino effect, he said. ""There were routing problems at some major European exchanges at the same time that caused major Internet service providers' routers to encounter a higher load and pass fewer packets.""

"(EW.com) -- Shad Gregory Moss hasn't gone by the name Lil' Bow Wow for some time now. But if you squint hard enough and try to ignore the barrage of broad African-American stereotypes in his latest film, ""Lottery Ticket,"" it's easy to see that the former pint-size Snoop Dog protégé has grown into a likable leading man. In this frenetic, family-friendly riff on the Friday formula, Bow Wow plays Kevin, an honest, hard-working high school grad who lives in an Atlanta housing project and punches the clock selling Air Jordans at the local Foot Locker. That is, until he realizes he's holding the winning ticket in a $370 million lottery. After his loose-lipped, Bible-thumping grandma (Waiting to Exhale's Loretta Devine) spills the beans about his imminent payday, a flood of characters (or, to be more accurate, caricatures) cozy up to him to get their cut. Gangsters, gospel preachers, gold diggers -- Kevin sees through their greed and ulterior motives. But not before going on a wild spending spree that would make Pretty Woman proud. The problem is, music video director Erik White's blue-collar fantasy wants to have it both ways: For every well-intentioned speech Kevin gives about the lottery being a rigged game designed to keep poor folks down, there's a montage of him giddily blowing wads of cash on sneakers and sports cars.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- British forces in southern Afghanistan have handed responsibility for security in the Sangin district of Helmand province to the U.S. Marines, the British and American militaries said Monday. British forces have been in Sangin since 2006. The transfer of authority was first announced by the British defense secretary in July. It follows heavy British losses in the area, a Taliban stronghold. The British sustained 105 casualties in Sangin -- roughly a third of all British deaths in the country, according to Lt. Campbell Spencer, a spokesman for the International Security Assistance Force. British Defence Secretary Liam Fox acknowledged that ""the level of sacrifice has been high"" in praising the British mission in ""one of the most challenging areas of Afghanistan."" Campbell described the militants in the area as ""very skillful, very organized (and) very difficult to combat,"" adding that the Taliban is ""very well entrenched"" in Helmand province. NATO's International Security Assistance Force said the handover was possible because of the increase in the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Shamsullah Sahrai, a Sangin resident and a candidate in Saturday's parliamentary election, told CNN that residents in the district are happy that the United States is taking over because ""they believe that the United States has more decisiveness in the war than the British."" Sahrai said that under British control the security situation worsened, adding that residents are waiting to see whether security improves under U.S. control. ""They are waiting to see if the Americans can create security, job facilities, opening schools and investment on reconstruction projects,"" Sahrai said. The switch of command in Sangin is not a defeat for British troops, but simply works well militarily, said Michael Clarke, director of the Royal United Services Institute, an independent defense and security think tank in London. ""It never made much military sense to put troops into the northern areas of Sangin, Musa Qala and Kajacki in the first place,"" Clarke said in July when Fox announced the plan. ""But in 2006 they were sent there at the insistence of [Afghan] President [Hamid] Karzai, and once established, any pullback would have represented a victory for the Taliban."" With the arrival of some 18,000 U.S. Marines in the region by the end of August, it makes sense for the British troops to reorganize themselves and reinforce their numbers in central Helmand, Clarke said. It will make the British force more effective and safer, he said. The political fallout of the move, however, is unpredictable, Clarke said. When the Brits ended operations in the southern Iraqi city of Basra last year, it was under similar circumstances, but still appeared as a ""furtive retreat,"" he said. ""The image at home that Britain was giving up a job it could no longer handle was impossible to shake off,"" Clarke said. ""The same may attach to Sangin. This war is as much about image and perception as it is about who controls the ground in Afghanistan."" Spencer emphasized Monday that the handover ""is in no way the British backing away from Sangin. It's the redeployment of forces."" CNN's Melissa Gray and Ivan Watson contributed to this report.","British Royal Marines turn control of Sangin district to the U.S Marines .

"(CNN) -- Former champion Maria Sharapova was the biggest name to fall as she lost an epic three-set match with fellow-Russian Maria Kirilenko on a wet and windy opening day at the Australian Open. Sharapova committed 66 unforced errors to lose 7-6 3-6 6-4 in a match that lasted a marathon three hours and 21 minutes. It was a disappointing early exit for 14th seed Sharapova and continued a poor recent run in majors after she lost in the second round at Wimbledon and third round at the U.S. Open last year. The 2008 winner told reporters. ""I could be disappointed or I could take it as it is and just go back on the court and keep working. ""I choose option two. It's just a bad day. A bad day's not going to stop me from doing what I love. ""I'm still going to go back on the court and work hard and perform. I'll be back here on a Saturday of the second week, so you watch."" The anticipated second-round clash between returning Belgian Justin Henin and fifth seed Elena Dementieva will occur after they both negotiated the first round. Henin made her return to a grand slam after a 20-month retirement by beating compatriot Kirsten Flipkens 6-4 6-3, before Dementieva conceded just three games to see off Vera Dushevina 6-2 6-1. Both players are in form with wild card entrant Henin reaching the final at Brisbane a fortnight ago in her first tournament back, while Dementieva won the Sydney International last week after beating world number one Serena Williams in the final. Henin's fellow-returning Belgian Kim Clijsters hardly needed to raise a sweat as she beat Canadian qualifier Valerie Tetreault 6-0 6-4. The U.S. Open champion raced through the opening set in just 23 minutes, and while she took her foot off the accelerator in the second, the match was always within the 15th seed's keeping. Last year's runner-up and second seed Dinara Safina was made to battle for her first win beating Magdalena Rybarikova 6-4 6-4 in 89 minutes, while fellow-Russian and third seed Svetlana Kuznetsova was a straight-sets winner over Anastasia Rodionova 6-1 6-2.","Former champion Maria Sharapova is the biggest name to fall in the first round of the Australian Open .

"(CNN) -- Police in Texas are looking for a convicted murderer after a tip led them to a body in his back yard. Last week, Harris County Sheriff's Office investigators received a Crime Stoppers tip about a body being in a barrel at a northwest Houston address. The homeowner, Dennis Anderson, 64, was not home when police arrived but a roommate allowed them to check the property. Court documents say an old, rusted barrel with black paint on it was found and pried open. ""Upon opening the barrel, investigators discovered the skeletal remains of an unknown person,"" a statement from the Harris County Sheriff's Office says. The decaying body was that of a female, and it had been wrapped in a bed sheet and trash bags and was covered in dirt, the documents say. The legs had been tied together by what appeared to be weed trimmer line that also was tied to the neck of the victim. Authorities examining the barrel said it appeared to have been in place for some time, and noted that the bolts on top were rusty. The victim had been dead for several months, the documents say. The remains were taken to the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences for identification and to try to find the cause of death. While no charges have been filed against the homeowner, authorities are now searching for him. ""Mr. Anderson is only wanted for questioning at this time,"" said Christina Garza of the Harris County Sheriff's Office. Michelle Lyons of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice said Anderson was sentenced to life in prison for committing a double murder in 1972, but was paroled after serving 17 years. He also had concurrent sentences for theft and arson, Lyons said. More recently, he was sentenced to 180 days in prison for theft, and was held from July 12 to August 13 of this year. According to court documents, the tipster who led police to the body said Anderson had told him he had strangled a person and placed the body in the barrel. The informant also said Anderson had told him he takes the barrel with him when he moves from state to state.","A Crime Stoppers tip led police to look for a body in a backyard barrel .

"New York (CNN) -- A New York police officer getting her hair done over the weekend thwarted a would-be robber in a beauty salon, shooting the weapon from the gunman's hands, Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said in awarding the officer a promotion. Kelly praised the actions of newly promoted Det. Feris Jones Tuesday, saying she ""showed the steely courage and professionalism that epitomizes the finest traditions of the New York City Police Department."" ""Well done and congratulations,"" the commissioner said as he pinned a gold detective shield to Jones' uniform. Mayor Michael Bloomberg also expressed his gratitude at the news conference. ""This officer, like the other officers that are out there every day, really do take care of us,"" he said. Kelly said Jones was a customer in a salon Saturday when a man walked in with a gun. ""'This is no joke, this is a robbery. I will kill you,""' Kelly quoted the gunman as saying. After the man ordered the customers and employees into the bathroom, Jones reemerged with her weapon drawn, identified herself as a police officer, and told the man not to move, Kelly said. The suspect fired four shots at Jones, narrowly missing her head with one, the commissioner recounted.  She fired five shots back -- emptying her service revolver and marking the first time she'd ever fired her weapon in the line of duty -- and hit both of the man's hands, causing him to drop his 44-caliber gun. Her shots also knocked the handle off the door of the salon, briefly trapping the man as he tried to escape, Kelly said.  He eventually broke the window in the door and fled on foot. ""She knew the gunman might shoot, and when he did, she was ready for him, demonstrating stunning marksmanship in the process,"" the commissioner said. ""To describe Officer Jones as cool under fire would be a gross understatement,"" he added. ""That's my personality.  I don't fuss about much,"" Jones responded modestly, asking reporters to address her as ""Jonesy"" instead of Detective Jones. The new detective said she got her start in the department when her then-husband brought home an application for the force because he ""liked the coverage and medical benefits."" The accused gunman was arrested Monday, police said.  Winston Cox, 19, is charged with attempted murder, attempted aggravated robbery, and criminal possession of a weapon.","An off-duty cop getting her hair done stopped an attempted robbery .

"(CNN) -- With his nine special-needs children in his house and one of them with him in the master bedroom, a Florida man was on his knees when an armed intruder shot him in the face, then fired twice more after the victim had fallen face down on the floor, a medical examiner said Wednesday. Byrd Billings died execution-style the night of July 9, 2009, as did his wife, Melanie, after a band of people dressed as ninjas broke into their Beulah, Florida, home. Prosecutors say Leonard Gonzalez Jr., 35, led six other men into the house looking to steal an expected $13 million and personally killed the defenseless couple. Dr. Andrea Minyard testified Wednesday, the second day of Gonzalez's first-degree murder trial in Escambia County Circuit Court in Pensacola. She pinned needles on human-sized dummies to show how nine bullets hit the Billings' couple. Video footage aired earlier in the trial showed a masked, armed man hovering over a shirtless Byrd Billings in the palatial home's living room shooting a shirtless Byrd Billings twice, with one shot in each leg. Frederick Thornton -- part of the group who testified after pleading guilty to second-degree murder -- fingered Gonzalez as the man who fired the shots, then led the couple into the first-floor bedroom. After shooting Byrd Billings the first time, Gonzalez said ""where's the money at, and he told him to get up,"" said Thornton, 20. Defense attorneys dispute Thornton's assertion, claiming he's not a credible witness and saying another masked man fired the shots. The Billingses had 16 cameras around their home, set up to keep tabs on the nine special-needs children for whom they cared. There was no camera in the master bedroom, but prosecution witnesses Wednesday cited DNA tests as showing that Gonzalez likely handled the rifle used in the fatal shootings. One of the videos aired in court Tuesday shows the scene from one girl's bedroom as a red van packed with people arrives outside the house. The girl gets up out of bed as the masked men enter the house, then hides under the covers pretending to sleep after hearing the commotion nearby. The team had started, then called off, an armed invasion at the home on July 4. Before the second try, Rakeem Florence -- who, like Thornton, plead guilty to second-degree murder for his role and testified for the prosecution -- said there was no mention anyone would be killed until he overheard Gonzalez minutes before they went to the house. ""He said he was going to kill somebody,"" Florence, now 18, said of Gonzalez. Florence and Thornton claimed Gonzalez captained the scheme, leading pre-invasion meetings, supplying the firearms and all-black clothing, and ordering they destroy the clothing afterward. Florence testified that he was told the plotters were trying to get laundered cash believed to be in a safe at the house, as the Billings family was ""washing money from the Mexican mafia."" Defense attorneys for Gonzalez questioned the credibility of the two witnesses, since they are related (Florence is the father of a child born to Thornton's sister) and had changed the stories they told their family and police, saying they had ""practiced lying."" Also Wednesday, the jury of 11 women and two men saw prosecutors try to establish the guns used in the crime, as well as see the safe taken from the Billings' home. Prosecutors say a small safe containing prescription medication, family documents and some jewelry was later was found in the backyard of a woman who said she was a friend of Gonzalez, authorities said. Two sources familiar with the investigation told CNN that a second safe at the home contained at least $100,000. The defendant's wife, Tabitha Gonzalez, testified Tuesday that the family's business, a karate school, had gone under. Byrd Billings had even donated $5,000 to the Gonzalez's school. Prosecutors argue this indicates that financial gain was Leonard Gonzalez's overriding motive in the armed invasion. ""He was so broke ... that his mother had to buy him a car, which turned out to be a big red van that was used in the murders,"" prosecutor Bill Eddins said in his opening statements of Gonzalez, who had six children with Tabitha. Of the eight people arrested in the case, seven males faced charges of murder and home invasion robbery. Two of them have already pleaded guilty to second-degree murder charges. The woman is accused of being an accessory after the fact. The remaining males, including a 16-year-old charged as an adult, have pleaded not guilty to the charges. If convicted, Gonzalez could be sentenced to death. In Session's Jean Casarez and Nancy Leung contributed to this report.","Medical examiner claims Florida man was shot twice when he was face down .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai on Sunday stoody by a decree to disband private security firms operating in his country, despite objections from the United States and other countries that the move would leave international development organizations without adequate protection to do their work. Karzai said that he has wanted to disband the organizations for some time and had warned about security for development organizations before, but that his words went unheeded. ""I mentioned that problem five years ago but international friends called it impossible and threatened to close the development projects at that time,"" Karzai said. ""Again, I mentioned that problem three years ago and I requested the international community to help us in implementing it but they asked me to give them time more two years. Now the Afghanistan government is committed in its decision to disband the private security companies."" Karzai believes that the private security companies are creating a parallel security system that challenges the Afghan security forces, his office said. Regarding protection for the development organizations, Karzai asked other countries to present a list of security requirements for large national projects and that the Afghan government would take decisions on whether and how to safeguard them. The only exception to the closure of private security firms is their work protecting embassies and diplomats. Meanwhile, some U.S.-funded development organizations have begun implementing contingency plans that could result in those organizations pulling out of the country. The U.S. government and NATO have been talking to the Afghan government about the ramifications of the measure. The most recent meeting was Sunday, when Karzai and members of his government met with U.S. Ambassador Karl Eikenberry, Gen. David Petraeus -- top U.S. military commander in Afghanistan -- and others. All the participants at the meeting reiterated their support for the decree and agreed to continue working together on implementing the ban in a way that doesn't leave development agencies in a lurch, U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said. ""As a matter of priority, the United States will continue to work with the Afghan government and international community to fully implement the decree over a period of time to ensure the protection of our development implementing partners as they continue their operations,"" Hayden said. One day earlier, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke to Karzai to offer ideas on how to implement the ban on private security firms, according to State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley in a Twitter message. Crowley said the Clinton suggested building a joint plan to steadily replace contractors while managing the impact on existing operations. Clinton also pledged to work cooperatively with Karzai to support a smooth transition to full Afghan security responsibility, he said.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The grease-covered orange overalls can't hide 14-year-old Nazer Ahmad's frail frame. As he leans under the hood of a wrecked car, torn plastic sandals on his feet, I know I cannot possibly understand the life this young boy is forced to lead in war-torn Afghanistan -- where jobs are few, pay is appalling, and young children must work rather than go to school and play with their friends. Nazer is one of the boy mechanics of the Sarai Malim yard in western Kabul. CNN producer Matiullah Mati has brought me here. As an Afghan, Mati sees a side of life here that the NATO generals and politicians never see. There are dozens of young boys here -- thin and frail because of a lack of nutrition brought on by staggering poverty. They are typically brought to the muddy yard by a male relative. Dozens of ramshackle huts, lean-tos and tiny one-room buildings house auto mechanics and repair shops where cars, buses and trucks are brought by local Afghans to be fixed. There is no safety gear. Welding sparks hit one young boy's eye as Nazer carries large pieces of metal across the yard. Another young boy struggles under the weight of large pails of supplies he is carrying. Nazer agrees to sit for a few minutes to talk to me, with Mati translating. His words are few. I quickly learn he works ten hours a day, six days a week. The boss pays him less than a dollar a day. And his wages are the only income for his family of five. His father was blinded years ago in a Soviet rocket attack and cannot work. His mother has two other small children at home. Nazer has had three years of school. Then, last year, his uncle brought him here. It takes Nazer one hour to walk from his one-room home to the yard. He arrives at 7 a.m. and begins to work. He and the boys get a morning and noon meal. At the end of his ten-hour day, this small boy walks home again, often in the very lonely dark. When I ask if he ever plays with friends, I get a heartbreaking answer of one word: ""No."" In Nazer's world there is no time for play. He tells me he just works and there is ""no time for fun."" He tells me he is happy to have the job and be able to help his family. But these boy mechanics of Kabul do have dreams of another life for themselves -- and, remarkably, for their country. Nazer tells me he would like to go back to school and become a teacher. He says he feels it's a way he can ""serve"" his country. Throughout our chat, Nazer never smiles. Not once. Across the yard we meet 12-year-old Mohammed Azam inside one of the dark shops, bent over his cooking pots. His father brings him here to cook for the workers and then he can go to school. Mohammed says he doesn't want to be a mechanic. He says he wants to be a doctor so he can ""serve society."" Mohammed's father Najibullah has a philosophical outlook tempered by the reality of life in this country. ""Knowledge is good, education is good. But most of these boys are poor and they must work."" CNN's Matiullah Mati contributed to this report.","Boys in their early teens work as mechanics with no safety gear in Afghan capital .

"(CNN) -- A roadside blast killed a NATO service member Wednesday in northern Afghanistan, the International Security Assistance Force said. The international alliance does not provide the nationalities of victims. An alliance statement did not provide an exact location of the improvised explosive device attack. This year is already the deadliest for coalition and U.S. forces since the battle against the Taliban started some nine years ago. Last year, 516 coalition troops were killed in Afghanistan. More than 600 have died so far in 2010, according to a CNN tally -- with more than two months left in the year. The morbid milestone comes as the United States is making a strong effort to fight the Taliban. U.S. President Barack Obama ordered the deployment of 30,000 extra U.S. forces to Afghanistan this year, increasing the total American troop commitment to almost 100,000. At least 25 other countries pledged an additional 7,000 troops. The international alliance was formed under a U.N. mandate to bolster a secure environment and support the reconstruction of Afghanistan. NATO took command in 2003. The force comprises troops from dozens of countries.","This year is already the deadliest for coalition and U.S. forces .

"Washington (CNN) -- Chandra Levy's mother averted her eyes Wednesday as prosecutors showed the jury a photograph of her daughter's skull discovered in woods by a man and his dog, a year after the Washington intern vanished in 2001. Philip Palmer testified he found the skull while walking his puppy ""Paco"" in an area away from established paths in Washington's Rock Creek Park. Authorities believe the young woman was attacked while jogging and dragged away from a trail by suspect Ingmar Guandique, who allegedly killed her when she resisted. Guandique denies killing the woman, who had just turned 24 and was preparing to return to her parents' home in California after a federal internship. Her mother, Susan Levy, who also is on the government's witness list, has been in the spectator gallery throughout the trial. When prosecutors brought out the 8-by-10 glossy police photograph, she turned her head aside and avoided watching as the picture was placed on an overhead projector for the jury to see on a large screen in the courtroom. Prosecutors then played an audio recording of a call to 911 Palmer made from a borrowed telephone at a construction site some distance away. After explaining he had been walking with his dog in the woods, Palmer was heard telling police, ""I came across a human skull.""  The emergency worker answering the phone asked him if he was sure, and Palmer replied that he was ""not sure anything else looks like that, that has (dental) fillings."" The emergency worker seemed to chuckle at the description and said ""guess not,"" as he took down a location.  ""I've got a dog leash marking the spot,"" Palmer added. The jury Wednesday also heard from Guandique's former landlord, who said she twice allowed Guandique to stay at her own apartment after what were said to be fights with his girlfriend. ""She had attacked him,"" property manager Sheila Phillips quoted Guandique as saying. Phillips said there were family ties with the suspect that began while ""Ingmar was living with my husband's uncle."" Eventually he moved in with a woman in the same apartment complex, but the two didn't get along, Phillips testified. Guandique showed up at her place with cuts and a swollen lip around May 1, 2001, saying he'd had another fight with the girlfriend, Phillips told prosecutor Fernando Campoamor-Sanchez. The date was at about the same time Chandra Levy is thought to have been attacked and killed. Prosecutors hope to prove Guandique's injuries are from Levy fighting for her life.  ""He told people his girlfriend did it,"" said prosecutor Amanda Haines during opening statements Monday. ""But the girlfriend at four-foot something and 90 pounds, will say no,"" Haines told the jury. Defense attorney Santha Sonenberg, during cross-examination of the landlord, challenged the time frame of Guandique's purported May 1 fight, saying Phillips later said she was not sure of the exact date. Prosecutors prepared to call the former girlfriend to the witness stand later Wednesday. The woman was expected to tell the jury Guandique physically attacked her during the arguments. On Tuesday the jury heard from Robert Levy, the dead woman's father, who described the family's frantic search for Chandra, who by the first week of May was overdue for a flight home, and missing her graduation ceremony in southern California. Looking through her cellphone records, Levy testified he called one that rang at the office of then-California Rep. Gary Condit. The family immediately thought he was linked to her disappearance. ""We were mad at Condit, trying to point him as the villain,"" Robert Levy testified on cross-examination Tuesday. ""I was suspicious of him. He was the primary suspect,"" Levy said, reflecting on a transcript of what he earlier had told a grand jury investigating the case. ""We were thinking Condit was the guilty one before we knew about this character here,"" Levy testified, looking toward the defendant. Levy's disappearance nine years ago received widespread publicity because  of her alleged relationship with the sitting California Democrat. The  revelation contributed to the political downfall of Condit, who will be called  to testify during the trial. Police said Condit was never a suspect in the case, although he was questioned intensively as investigators tried to find Levy. A police supervisor testified Tuesday he was taken off the case when he told his superiors their pressure to pursue Condit was interfering with the investigation. Still, when authorities questioned Condit in the weeks after Levy's disappearance, he seemed evasive, according to detective Sgt. Ronald Wyatt of the Metropolitan Police Department. He testified Condit ""was a bit arrogant and not forthright"" in a 2001 meeting at the congressman's condominium in Washington.       Wyatt said Condit denied having an intimate affair with Levy. Guandique's public defenders say DNA evidence exonerates him since it does not match the suspect, Levy, or Condit. Assistant U.S. Attorney Amanda Haines told the jury in opening statements Monday that the ""dozen or so skin cells"" found on Levy's jogging tights are the result of contamination by poorly-handled evidence.

"(CNN) -- At least 20 people have died in severe flooding in Vietnam, official media reported Monday. But the death toll varied as the state-run Vietnam News Agency (VNA) said the death toll is 30 as of Sunday, sourcing a government flood committee. Floods damaged crops and hindered transportation leaving passengers stranded in trains and blocking roadways, and flood waters covered more than 150,000 homes, VNA reported. Seven died in Ha Tinh province after Sunday's rainfall reached more that 800 millimeters (31.5 inches), according to VietNamNet. The province accounted for more than half the homes reported flooded. A similar amount of rain fell on Nghe An province, triggering flooding that killed eight people but inundating far fewer homes, VietNamNet reported. Four more died in Quang Binh province. One person has been reported missing in this week's floods. Throughout the region, people and cattle could be seen sitting on roofs, while boats floated through what would otherwise have been the nation's streets. About 1 meter of water lay over some parts of a Highway 1A, a north-south connection through Vietnam, and service on the north-south railway through the southeastern Asian nation was suspended, reported state-run Vietnam News. The Vietnamese government is distributing 2,000 tons of rice and $10 million worth of aid to the worst-hit areas, in Ha Trinh and Quang Binh provinces, reports said. Record-setting rains a few weeks earlier in central Vietnam spurred severe flooding that killed 66 people and inundated more than 10,000 dwellings. Hundreds of Vietnamese troops were dispatched to the region in the first week of October to help with rescue operations and help residents and business owners deal with millions of dollars of damage.","Heavy rains and severe flooding in central Vietnam led to the deaths of 20 people .

"(CNN) -- A massive drilling machine broke through rock beneath the Swiss Alps on Friday, creating what is being touted as the world's longest railroad tunnel. The Gotthard Base Tunnel is 57 km (34 miles) and links northern and southern Europe, AlpTransit Gotthard company said in a statement. ""The world's longest tunnel should become operational at the end of 2017,"" the statement said. The tunnel will cut regional travel time on routes including Zurich, Switzerland, to Milan, Italy, an important business link. Officials say demands for railroads have increased as international trade goes up and road traffic worsens. Freight traffic in the entire Alpine region will grow by as much as 75 percent by 2010, according to a study by the EU Commission. The trend will affect the environment, prompting Switzerland to adopt environmentally-friendly means of travel. The company says the tunnel is an environmental feat and will allow millions more tons of items to pass through the Alps by rail. ""Only by upgrading its railway infrastructure can Switzerland meet the rising demand for freight transportation and the increasing needs of customers,"" the statement said.","The tunnel will cut travel time in the region, including between Switzerland and Italy .

"(CNN) -- Arab nations meeting in Libya said they will support Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' decision to refrain from direct peace talks unless Israel stops settlement construction. ""Restarting negotiations is conditional to the complete stop of settlement building on occupied Palestinian land, including East Jerusalem,"" according to a statement issued Friday from the Arab League Ministerial Committee on the Arab Peace Initiative. ""The Israeli government is responsible for halting the direct negotiations ... as a result of its continued unlawful settlement policy."" The Israeli prime minister's office had no immediate comment on the developments in Libya. The statement supported U.S. peacemaking efforts and President Barack Obama's speech at the U.N. General Assembly last month regarding Palestinian rights. It also called for a ""U.S. recognition of an independent Palestinian state with pre-June 4, 1967, borders and east Jerusalem as its capital."" The statement also said there won't be ""real peace with Israel"" unless the Jewish state withdraws from occupied Arab lands, including Syria's occupied Golan and Palestinian territory. The statement said the international community should ""take necessary steps"" to end Israel's blockade of Gaza and it called for ending political differences among Palestinians. The peace initiative committee comprises the foreign ministers of Jordan, Bahrain, Tunisia, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, the Palestinian Authority, Lebanon, Egypt, Morocco, Yemen, United Arab Emirates, Oman and Qatar. Nabil Shaath, an adviser to Abbas, told CNN on Friday that all the efforts should be focused on settlement activities and that the United States should pressure Israel to halt all the settlement activities. He also said Abbas will be delivering an important speech during the Arab League summit this weekend. The United States had been scrambling to find a way to save the recently started direct Middle East peace talks ahead of the Arab League meeting in Libya this weekend. U.S., Israeli, Palestinian and Arab sources say intensive negotiations continue between the United States and Israel to find a formula on Israel's construction of new settlements that will keep Abbas at the talks. Sources said the Obama administration has floated a possible set of assurances the United States could offer if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would agree to extend a freeze on new settlements.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama gently sparred with Jon Stewart on ""The Daily Show"" in the final run-up to next week's midterm elections, after the comedian called his legislative progress ""timid."" Playing off the title of Obama's book ""The Audacity of Hope,"" Stewart challenged the forcefulness of the president's political agenda during his first two years in office. ""Is the difficulty that you have here the distance between what you ran on and what you delivered?"" Stewart said.  ""You ran with such, if I may, audacity ... yet legislatively it has felt timid at times."" ""Jon, I love your show, but this is something where I have a profound disagreement with you ..."" Obama said, leaning forward and intently tapping his finger on the desk, ""this notion that health care was timid."" ""This is what most people would say is as significant a piece of legislation as we have seen in this country's history,"" the president continued, saying the Affordable Care Act will provide health coverage for 30 million people, introduces a Patient's Bill of Rights and will cut the deficit by over a trillion dollars. ""What happens is, it gets discounted because the presumption is we didn't get 100 percent of what we wanted, we only get 90 percent of what we wanted -- so let's focus on the 10 percent we didn't get as opposed to the 90 percent we did,"" Obama said. The 30-minute program taped at Washington's Harman Center for the Arts took place before a packed house, with some waiting in line for up to four hours to attend.  ""The Daily Show"" is in Washington all week ahead of Stewart's planned ""Rally to Restore Sanity"" on the National Mall on Saturday. ""You ran on the idea that this system needed basic reform ... feels like some reform was done in a political manner that has papered over a system that is corrupt,"" Stewart said, again challenging the pace and extent of change initiated by the Obama administration. ""Over the last two years, in emergency situations, our basic attitude was we have to get things done, in some cases quicker,"" the president said, acknowledging the global economic crisis that was swirling at the time he took office.  ""[Democratic leaders] worked within the process instead of transforming the process."" During a lighter moment, Stewart presented Obama with Mug Force One -- a presidential coffee cup. The men traded quips over ""The Daily Show"" stage, which resembled a Grecian temple. ""This is a nice set,"" Obama said. ""It reminds me of the convention."" ""We actually bought it, it was in a warehouse,"" Stewart retorted. The president's theme of change from the 2008 race resurfaced during the show, along with a popular campaign slogan. ""When we promised during campaign 'change you can believe in,' it wasn't 'change you can believe in' in 18 months,"" Obama said to applause from the audience. ""We're going to have to work for it."" Noting the tough election climate, the president said he hopes Democratic members of Congress are rewarded on election day for the tough votes they took on health care and financial regulatory reform. Near the end of the interview, Obama invoked his famous campaign phrase, ""Yes we can, but it's not going to happen overnight,"" prompting a laugh from Stewart. CNN's Ed Payne and Padma Rama contributed to this report.","President Obama appears on the show .

"(CNN) -- Help trickled in Thursday, three days after a magnitude-7.7 earthquake struck off Indonesia, triggering a tsunami that has killed at least 311 people and left more than 400 missing. An assessment team from the nonprofit group SurfAid International had reached the disaster zone, but the area's remoteness prevented further contact with headquarters in Sumatera Barat, Indonesia. SurfAid had shipped 1,000 shelter kits to victims, and is preparing to send more supplies once communication is established, spokeswoman Jossi Syahrial said Thursday. The group was trying to work with government officials to establish an information and coordination hub for all non-governmental organizations, she said. The hard-hit Mentawai Islands region is among Indonesia's myriad islands. ""It's very difficult"" to reach the region either by boat or road, said Andrew Judge, CEO of SurfAid. The trip takes at least 10 hours in good conditions, according to aid agencies. The Indonesian Red Cross also had sent at least two aid teams. One aid shipment included about 400 body bags. Urgent needs are expected to include clean water, food, blankets, clothing, medical attention, emergency shelter and hygiene kits, said Ita Balanda, a program manager for the World Vision aid organization in Padang, Indonesia. An estimated 7,900 households were affected, she said. ""The worst hit area is North and South Pagai Island. Reports of villages flattened are coming from there,"" said Antorizon of the West Sumatra disaster management agency, who like many Indonesians goes by one name. The first pictures from North Pagai Island showed damaged and flattened structures. Monday's quake generated a ""significant"" tsunami, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said. Some of the missing might include people who are unaccounted for after fleeing to higher ground, said Henri Dori Satoko, head of the Mentawai Islands parliament. Though communication poses a challenge in the remote area, some witnesses in West Sumatra reported seeing a wave 6 meters (nearly 20 feet) high. Other reports described the tsunami as being about 3 meters (almost 10 feet) high. At least one village with a population of about 200 people was swept away, with only 40 people recovered, Satoko said. The quake struck at 9:42 p.m. Monday, triggering a tsunami warning. Its epicenter was 240 kilometers (150 miles) south of Padang, at a depth of 20.6 kilometers (12.8 miles), according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The magnitude was revised upward from a preliminary magnitude of 7.5. ""On Mentawai, a [tsunami] warning was issued seven minutes after detection of earthquake, which is what the existing system is capable of doing. Preliminary report indicates the destructive waves hit the Mentawai Islands after five minutes. ... For Mentawai villagers, the warning is late, as they are very close to the tsunami source,"" said Sanny Jegillos of the U.N. Development Programme. He oversees the Indian Ocean tsunami warning system, including Indonesia. Indonesia's government has since warned residents of West Sumatra province to stay alert and stay away from the coastline for up to five days because of the possibility of more earthquakes, Balanda said. The city of Padang and the Mentawai Islands are at the meeting place of two tectonic plates, making them vulnerable to earthquakes and tsunamis. On December 26, 2004, a 9.1-magnitude earthquake struck off northern Sumatra. A tsunami generated by that earthquake killed more than 225,000 people in 14 countries -- mainly India, Indonesia, Maldives, Sri Lanka and Thailand. The Indonesian region of Banda Aceh was hard-hit: About 150,000 died there. CNN's Kathy Quiano and Stan Grant contributed to this report.","The area's remoteness has limited help and communications .

"CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- As a young man, Barack Obama idolized the leaders of the Civil Rights Movement. A young Barack Obama, left, joins fellow Chicago community activists for this snapshot in the mid-1980s. ""Reading about people not that much older than me who had gone to jail and suffered beatings in order to liberate a people,"" he said, ""I thought there's something powerful about that."" Fellow Harvard University student Kenneth Mack remembered walking around the Harvard Law campus with his friend, who was constantly quoting the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. "" 'The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice,' "" Mack remembered Obama saying. ""For other people to say things like that, people wouldn't take it seriously, but with Barack, people really did take him seriously. They thought of him as someone who really sincerely believed it."" But Obama was about 20 years too late to join King's movement. So, he decided to do the next best thing. In 1985, a few years before he went to Harvard, Obama took a job as a community organizer.  Test your knowledge about Obama » . He worked with Jerry Kellman's Developing Communities Project. As a leader, he stayed in the background, but he taught residents of Chicago's poor South Side how to effectively lobby their government to get badly needed services. ""Remember, at the time in Chicago, the wards were really politically motivated,"" said the Rev. Alvin Love, pastor at Lilydale First Baptist Church. ""If you weren't onboard with the political process and people in leadership, then your garbage didn't get picked up on time and your street didn't get fixed."" Obama helped bring pastors like Love and other community activists together to work on their neighborhood's problems. En masse, they showed up at city meetings, and in a professional but firm manner made their concerns heard. ""Politicians understand that the number of community residents that come out for a community meeting probably represent 10 times the number of votes,"" Love said. ""So they pay attention.""  See Obama timeline » . At first, the group achieved simple things. It got the city to clean up Palmer Park, a park filled with garbage and overrun with drug dealers. It got the city to start an after-school program. It even got the area its first badly needed job center.  See photos of Obama campaigning » . ""It might have been small victories to the outside world, but to us, it was big. It meant those kids could get the jobs; they could buy things to start back to school,"" said Yvonne Lloyd, one of the residents Obama trained to lead lobbying efforts. The small success gave residents something that would last a lot longer than a clean park or a job center. Residents said Obama gave them hope. ""We saw what could happen. We saw what can be done if the community has the resources and somebody to come in and train them. I'll always be grateful for that,"" Lloyd said. The biggest challenge Obama's group faced was the one that eventually ended Obama's career as a community organizer. Linda Randle, a fellow activist, brought a dramatic injustice to Obama's attention. At her job at the Ida B. Wells housing project, she noticed workers removing asbestos from the Public Housing Authority's offices in that building. When she asked management when they planned to remove the dangerous substance from residents' apartments, she said they told her they had no such plans. She was livid. ""I'm a lot more of a hothead than Barack is,"" she said. ""Barack is more for compromise, you know. He'll wait and see."" Obama joined the growing effort to lobby the city to remove the asbestos from public housing. Randle said he counseled calm and added that was good for her, because he encouraged her to take the high road in negotiations. ""So I would say to myself, OK, I'm not really great at the high road, because the road is already crumbling, OK? So, I don't know if I can make the road higher."" Eventually, the Housing Authority gave in to the residents' pressure. The management promised to remove asbestos from all parts of the buildings, not just its offices. The effort took years, and the slow pace of this change frustrated Obama. He told friends at the time he felt he'd be more effective on the other side of the negotiating table. Soon, he left Chicago for Harvard. But before he left, he told residents he would come back and help. Twenty years later, a few of those same residents he trained to speak truth to power appeared in his Senate offices. They were recently in Washington to lobby him for federal funds to extend the elevated train to their neighborhood. ""This is the only area of Chicago where real transportation does not run to the city limits,"" Love said. ""We have a whole community that's isolated with no way to get to jobs."" After lobbying their old friend, Love and his fellow residents got some of the money they requested. ""With Sen. Obama's help, we wound up getting President Bush to sign the transportation bill allocating $580 million for the extension of the Red Line train,"" he said. But the group is still waiting for Illinois to come up with its share of the funds. If that doesn't work, Love said, he hopes he will be able to take the issue even higher. ""We may someday soon have a president in the White House who will listen to people like us,"" Love said. ""Then maybe, finally, we'll have someone who will respond to our needs.""","Presidential candidate worked as community organizer in Chicago in 1985 .

"London, England (CNN) -- Three Pakistani cricket players at the center of a gambling scandal have been charged with ""various offenses"" by the sport's governing body, the International Cricket Council announced Thursday. Team captain Salman Butt, Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir have all said they were innocent but have been provisionally suspended pending a decision on the charges, the council said. ""We will not tolerate corruption in cricket -- simple as that,"" said the council's chief executive, Haroon Lorgat. ""We must be decisive with such matters and if proven, these offenses carry serious penalties up to a life ban."" A fine could also be imposed as part of the punishment. Lorgat cautioned that the players' guilt has not been proven. ""That is for the independent tribunal alone to decide,"" he said. Meanwhile, Pakistani High Commissioner Wajid Shamsul Hassan told reporters after meeting with the players that he believes their claims of innocence. ""They have not been proven guilty,"" Hassan told a throng of reporters. ""And until you are proven guilty, you are innocent."" A police investigation into the alleged scandal is continuing, but no further meeting with police or questioning of the men is scheduled, he said. Hassan did, however, vow to take legal action to defend the players if necessary. ""I think we will go to the court of law to defend them,"" he said. Eighteen-year-old Amir is the youngest-ever bowler to reach 50 Test wickets. He took six wickets -- considered an impressive feat -- against England in the Test on which the betting allegations are centered. For such an exciting prospect, already hugely popular in his homeland, to be tarnished by a scandal like this has depressed many cricket fans in Pakistan. Asif has already courted controversy in his career. He has tested positive for steroids twice, and soon after the second offense, he was caught with a recreational drug in his wallet at the Dubai airport and was kept in detention for three weeks. The betting allegations emerged Sunday in the British tabloid News of the World, which reported that two Pakistan players deliberately bowled ""no balls,"" or fouls, during their Test series with England in London last week. It said the alleged ringleader made 150,000 pounds ($232,800) in the scam. England won the match at Lord's Cricket Ground. It ended Sunday afternoon, after the scandal broke. Hassan said Thursday it is possible the players are the victims of a setup, saying they have been ""maligned by the media"" and are the victims of ""character assassination by the media."" ""You have to investigate to find out whether they've been set up or not,"" he said. Referring to the News of the World -- a newspaper known for its sensational headlines -- he added, ""What is the reputation of those people who have brought us this story?"" Team manager Yawar Saeed said London's Metropolitan Police have already questioned him and the three players. Several people have been arrested in connection with the case. The Met Police arrested a 35-year-old man late Saturday on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud bookmakers and released him on bail Sunday, and customs officials arrested three people Sunday on suspicion of money laundering. Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari also ordered an investigation into the scandal, his spokesman said Sunday.

"(CNN) -- Tour de France legend Laurent Fignon has died from cancer in a Paris hospital aged just 50. Fignon won the Tour in 1983 and 1984 but was perhaps most famous for the 1989 contest, when he was beaten by Greg Lemond by only eight seconds -- the smallest winning margin in the history of the race. The Frenchman actually held the lead going into the final stage time-trial into Paris, but he let his advantage slip to allow American Lemond to snatch victory in the most dramatic finish ever seen. As well as his two Tour victories, Fignon won nine stages and held the leader's yellow jersey for 22 days. His other big race successes included two wins in the Milan-San Remo one-day classic and two stage wins in both the Giro d'Italia and Vuelta Espana. Fignon was a colorful character on and off the bike, famous for his flowing blond hair and glasses, and was also regarded as an anti-establishment figure. In his autobiography, ""We Were Young and Carefree"", Fignon admitted taking amphetamines and cortisone during his career but did not establish a direct link with his cancer. ""In those days everyone was doing it,"" he explained in his book. ""But it is impossible to know to what extent doping harms you. ""Whether those who lived through 1998, when a lot of extreme things happened, will get cancer after 10 or 20 years, I really can't say."" Meanwhile, tributes for Fignon have poured in from the world of cycling. Defending Tour de France champion Alberto Contador led the tributes on his Twitter page, saying: ""Today we lost a great champion, Laurent Fignon, after a hard struggle. It was a privilege to share some time with him in Paris. Rest in peace. Lance Armstrong, who himself battled cancer before becoming the greatest Tour de France champion of all time, said on his official website:  ""I awoke today to the terrible news that my dear friend and legendary cyclist Laurent Fignon has passed away. ""I will never forget the early 90's when I first turned pro, of course terrified of the older guys. Laurent was always a friendly face with words of advice. He was a special man to me, to cycling, and to all of France. Laurent, we will all miss you."" And fellow-American Lemond, whose name will always be linked with Fignon after their epic 1989 duel, echoed those sentiments. ""I will miss Laurent Fignon as a great person and competitor. A truly sad day for everyone whose lives he touched."" In later life, Fignon became a consultant for French television and commentated on the Tour de France in 2009 and 2010 despite the treatment he was receiving.","Tour de France legend Laurent Fignon has died from cancer in a Paris hospital .

"(CNN) -- Brazilian striker Robinho, the most expensive player in English football history after Manchester City paid Real Madrid 42.5 million euros for him two years ago, has joined AC Milan on a four-year contract for an undisclosed fee. The 26-year-old became the first big-name signing in City's recent revolution, but he failed to settle in the north of England -- going back home to join Santos on loan in January before eventually leaving Eastlands on a permanent basis for the San Siro. Robinho will link up with recent Barcelona loan signing Zlatan Ibrahimovic and compatriots Ronaldinho and Alexandre Pato in an exciting-looking forward line for the new Serie A season. ""I am really happy to be here,"" Robinho told Milan's official website. ""I am delighted to have been given this opportunity and I want to prove my worth. ""My ambition is to play well and to help Milan regain the title,"" added the Brazilian, who scored 14 goals in 41 appearances for the English side. With Robinho's arrival, Milan have allowed Klass Jan Huntelaar to leave the club with the Dutch striker signing for German Bundesliga side Schalke, as the final day of the summer transfer window saw a host of players move clubs. Schalke have paid Milan 14 million euros for the 27-year-old, who was a member of the Netherlands squad that reached the World Cup final in Soouth Africa. Huntelaar failed to establish himself as a regular in his one season at the San Siro following his move from Real Madrid in 2009. ""Negotiations were tougher than expected,"" Schalke coach Felix Magath told German newspaper Bild on Tuesday, ""I am happy to have Klaas Jan. He will help us."" Huntelaar was not alone in leaving the San Siro with long-serving defender Kakha Kaladze ending a 10-year association with Milan by joining Genoa. And striker Marco Borriello has also been allowed to move on following the signings of Robinho and Ibrahimovic, joining Roma on a one-year loan deal. Huntelaar will link up again with fomer Real Madrid team-mate Raul, who signed for the Gelsenkirchen-based side earlier in the year. On a busy day for Schalke, they have also signed 24-year-old Spanish midfielder Jose Manuel Jurado from Atletico Madrid and Lille defender Nicolas Plestan on a three-year deal. Elsewhere in Germany, Bundesliga leaders Hoffenheim have announced the signing of Icelandic midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson on a four-year deal from English Championship side Reading for a fee of seven million euros. Meanwhile, Stuttgart have announced the arrival of Italian international Mauro Camoranesi from Juventus on a one-year deal with an option for an additional year. The 34-year-old moves on after eight seasons with the club and joins Frenchman David Trezeguet, who has joined Spanish Primera Liga newcomers Hercules, in leaving the Turin giants as coach Luigi del Neri continues reshaping his squad. Hercules added to the signing of Trezeguet by completing the capture of Real Madrid's Dutch midfielder Royston Drenthe on a one-year loan deal. Another player to leave Juventus is French defender Jonathan Zebina, who has joined Brescia on a two-year contract. Juve have replaced Zebina in their squad with Arsenal left-back Armand Traore, who has joined on a season-long loan deal. In England, Sunderland have smashed their transfer record with the signing of Rennes striker Asamoah Gyan on a four-year contract. Gyan, who starred for Ghana in the World Cup finals, has cost Sunderland 15 million euros, beating the fee paid last year for Tottenham striker Darren Bent. The biggest domestic transfer in England saw Liverpool swoop for Fulham left-back Paul Konchesky for an undisclosed fee on a four-year contract. Liverpool manager Roy Hodgson, who was in charge of Konchesky when he was at Craven Cottage, has allowed Finnish striker Lauri Dalla Valle and Swedish winger Alex Kacaniklic to move to London in the opposite direction. Elsewhere in England, Birmingham City have pulled off a transfer coup by signing former Arsenal winger Alexander Hleb on a one-year loan deal from Barcelona. On a busy day for Birmingham manager Alex McLeish, the club also confirmed the signings of Spartak Moscow's Czech defender Martin Jiranek on a one-year contract and the capture of Chile international midfielder Jean Beausejour from Mexican outfit Club America on a three-year contract. Meanwhile, Argentine midfielder Javier Mascherano was unveiled as a Barcelona player to fans at the Camp Nou on Monday, after passing a five-hour medical at the Catalan club. The 26-year-old had made no secret of his wish to leave Liverpool and expressed his delight at signing a four-year deal with the Spanish champions. ""When I landed, I said that I was achieving a dream. At last I will be able to say that I play for Barcelona, the team who I wanted to play for,"" Mascherano told the official FIFA website. ""I'm going to have the chance to play with players who I admire. This is an opportunity of a lifetime.""","AC Milan complete the signing of Brazilian striker Robinho from Manchester City .

"Washington (CNN) -- Bullying and harassment in schools often includes violations of federally protected civil rights, the federal government warned Tuesday in new guidelines for educators on how to address the problem. If school administrators fail to properly deal with harassment based on gender, race or other issues, they risk being cited for contributing to a pattern of civil rights violations that could, in extreme cases, lead to a cut in federal funding, according to top officials who spoke to reporters on a conference call about the new guidelines. ""In extreme cases, schools could be stripped of their federal education monies if they don't comply with all of our civil rights laws,"" said Russlynn Ali, assistant secretary for civil rights. Also on the call were Arne Duncan, secretary of education, and White House Domestic Policy Council Director Melody Barnes. The issue of harassment gained prominence this year after a spate of suicides by students who were being bullied. President Obama has called for greater awareness of the problem, saying the nation must ""dispel the myth that bullying is just a normal rite of passage or an inevitable part of growing up."" The guidelines were part of a letter that began ""Dear Colleague"" sent Tuesday to thousands of schools, colleges, universities and school districts around the country that included examples of bullying and harassment cases that constituted violations of federal civil rights laws. In addition, the government said the White House will host a conference next year on preventing bullying and harassment, building on efforts by Duncan's department and other agencies. In August, the Obama administration hosted the first National Bullying Summit and launched a national campaign against bullying. Ali said the government proposed $410 million in fiscal year 2011 spending for ""successful, safe and healthy students,"" a 12 percent increase over 2010. In a statement Tuesday, the American Civil Liberties Union welcomed the new government guidelines for making clear that most religious, gender and sexual harassment comes under federal civil rights prohibitions, but it called for expanding the federal law to eliminate any doubt. ""Though the guidance goes far under current law, it does not replace having a federal statute that explicitly protects"" lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students, said Laura Murphy, the director of the ACLU's Washington legislative office. Murphy called for Congress to pass the Student Non-Discrimination Act, a bill pending in the House and Senate that the ACLU said would guarantee that homosexual and transgender students are explicitly protected from harassment and discrimination under federal law.","New federal guidelines sent to nation's schools and colleges .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama got help from baseball great Joe Torre at a White House event Wednesday highlighting new steps the government is taking to reduce domestic violence. Torre told the East Room audience about domestic abuse in his childhood home, where he said his father beat his mother. He pledged to help in any way he could to better protect the nation's children, whom he called ""our treasure."" ""Awareness is probably the biggest deterrent to domestic violence and abuse that goes on,"" said Torre, who with his wife started the Joe Torre Safe At Home Foundation to raise awareness about domestic violence. ""What better place than the White House to raise awareness?"" The new initiatives announced Wednesday include creation of a national advisory committee on violence against women that will work with U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and others to come up with best solutions for reducing domestic violence and helping the victims. Obama noted 25 percent of women in America experience domestic violence at some point in their lives. He described new initiatives that focus on protecting children, improving legal protection for victims, increasing arrests and successful prosecutions of sexual assault cases and helping victims attain financial independence. ""Nobody in America should live in fear because they are unsafe in their own home. No adult. No child,"" Obama said, adding that one goal is to make sure ""no one has to choose between a violent home and no home at all."" A background document provided by the White House said Obama ""has called on every agency in the federal government to be part of the solution to ending violence against women.""","Baseball great Joe Torre tells White House event about his abusive father .

"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Senior police officers failed to pursue extensive intelligence that indicated a Catholic priest was involved in one of Northern Ireland's worst terrorist attacks, an independent report concluded Tuesday. Nine people died and 30 were wounded July 31, 1972, when three bombs went off in the town of Claudy, in County Londonderry. The first was a car bomb that had been parked outside a local pub. Minutes later, bombs exploded outside a post office and a hotel, according to Irish state broadcaster RTE. No one was ever charged in the case, but there have long been suspicions that a Catholic priest was involved. Tuesday's report was issued by the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, an independent body that investigates complaints against the police. The report found that, rather than acting on the information about the priest's possible involvement, the police sought the government's help in dealing with the Catholic Church. The police then accepted the government's ""understanding"" that was reported back to them, the report found. ""The consequence of their acquiescence was that the investigation was further compromised,"" wrote Al Hutchinson, the police ombudsman. ""The decision failed those who were murdered, injured, and bereaved in the bombing. The police officers who were working on the investigation were also undermined."" The priest at the center of the controversy was identified by the report as Father James Chesney, who died in 1980. According to the ombudsman's investigation, police had ""extensive intelligence"" after the bombing from which they concluded Chesney worked for the Irish Republican Army as its regional director of operations. Police also knew of allegations he had been directly involved in both the Claudy bombings and other terrorist incidents, the report found. That should have led the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) -- the police force in Northern Ireland at the time -- to pursue further investigation that could have either implicated or cleared the priest, the report said. A detective wanted to arrest Chesney in the months after the bombing, but an assistant chief constable turned down that request, the report found. That senior officer then suggested to the government that it hold a meeting with Catholic officials about the issue. A government official wrote to the RUC in December 1972 to say the secretary of state for Northern Ireland met with Cardinal William Conway to express ""disgust"" at the priest's behavior, and that the cardinal said he knew the priest was a ""very bad man."" The cardinal promised to see ""what could be done"" about the priest, including a possible transfer to another parish. Then-chief Constable Graham Shillington wrote back to say only that he had seen the letter about the meeting and preferred a transfer. Chesney was moved to a parish in the Republic of Ireland in late 1973. Church records indicate that when questioned by his superiors, Chesney denied involvement in terrorist activity, the report said. As a result of the way police handled the case, the report said, the priest's denials were never tested. Hutchinson, the ombudsman, said the decisions made by those in charge at the time have to be considered in the context of the time. He said 1972 was one of the worst years of violence in Northern Ireland and the arrest of a priest could have aggravated the security situation. Without more information about why the police failed to follow up the leads, however, Hutchinson said their actions look like a collusive act. ""The key police decision-makers referred to in this statement are deceased,"" he said. ""Had they been alive today, their actions would have demanded explanation, which would have been the subject of further investigation."" The report found no evidence of criminal intent on the part of any government or Catholic official. It also found no evidence that the police had information that could have prevented the bombings. In a joint statement, Cardinal Sean Brady, Archbishop of Armagh, and Bishop Seamus Hegarty said they accepted the report's findings and conclusions. They said the church had made all known material available to investigators. ""Throughout the Troubles (the 30-year period of violence in Northern Ireland), the Catholic Church, along with other churches in Northern Ireland, was constant in its condemnation of the evil of violence,"" they said. ""It is therefore shocking that a priest should be suspected of involvement in such violence. ""This case should have been properly investigated and resolved during Father Chesney's lifetime. If there was sufficient evidence to link him to criminal activity, he should have been arrested and questioned at the earliest opportunity, like anyone else. We agree with the police ombudsman that the fact this did not happen failed those who were murdered, injured and bereaved in the bombings."" They appealed for any information about other suspects in the case. ""Father Chesney is dead and, as a suspect in the Claudy bombing, he is beyond the justice of earthly courts,"" they said. ""Clearly a number of people were involved in the planning and carrying out of this terrible atrocity, some of whom may still be alive. Those bereaved and injured deserve to know the truth. We appeal to anyone who has information in relation to this horrific crime to provide it to the Police Service of Northern Ireland."" The RUC became the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) in 2001. The ombudsman began its investigation in late 2002 after the PSNI said the RUC had information that a priest was an active IRA member and had been involved in the Claudy bombings .","The bombing in Claudy killed nine people and wounded 30 .

"(CNN) -- Now that 33 miners who have been trapped in the earth for 19 days have been found alive, the focus is shifting to their physical and mental health as they face a potentially long period before being rescued. Chile is calling on experts from space and sea to consult on how to maintain the psychological well-being of a group of men crammed into a small space. Experts from NASA and Chilean navy submarine experts have been called to help, Mining Minister Laurence Golborne said Tuesday. The miners have been trapped inside the San Jose copper and gold mine since an August 5 cave-in. A probe over the weekend reached the miners, who survived inside a shelter some 2,300 feet underground. Officials have estimated that it could take three to four months to reach the miners. So far, authorities have spoken with the miners via microphone, but have not disclosed to them their lengthy prediction for a rescue. ""We have still not told them the timetable, but we are sure that as miners, they know this will take a long time,"" Health Minister Jaime Manalich said. As it is, relief such as food and nutrients will also be reaching the miners in small amounts. Manalich said that the miners will likely not be given solid food for five days. Instead, authorities will send down fluids, liquid proteins and liquid vitamins. The strategy is a precaution, Manalich said, as doctors do not know the exact health of the miners. So far, however, the diagnosis looks good, he said. None of the men suffered major injuries, though some have minor injuries, Manalich said. Some of the miners reported eye irritation from the dust. Health officials are designing an exercise program and light work to keep the trapped miners physically and mentally active, Manalich said. On Monday, the trapped workers cheered, applauded and sang the country's national anthem in their first verbal contact with officials. Several of Chile's top officials gathered around a white telephone outside the mine as the miners' voices crackled through the speakers in an emotional conversation that was also broadcast on television. ""We are listening all of us, strong and clear. Who's speaking?...How are you doing?"" said Golborne, according to CNN Chile. Miner Luiz Urzua responded: ""We are well and hoping that you will rescue us."" The miners cheered as officials informed them that their family members had been keeping vigil outside the mine, CNN Chile reported. The San Jose mine is near the town of Copiapo, in the Atacama region in northern Chile. ""Yesterday, all of Chile celebrated in all the plazas of the country that we had made contact with you. Today they are going to be even happier that we have spoken,"" Golborne said. The miners survived for more than 17 days by sharing small amounts of tuna and mackerel that were in a shelter, along with water, President Sebastian Pinera told CNN en Espanol on Monday. ""They had very little food,"" he said. ""They told us they ate tuna and mackerel every other day, and that they shared ... a jar of peaches among the 33."" The area where the miners find themselves is about 50 square meters (538 square feet), Pinera said. He described the shelter as a type of cavern where they had access to an area called the ""workshop,"" where they found batteries for light and water for consumption. Pinera estimated the temperatures where the miners are hover between 32-35 degrees Celsius (90-95 degrees Fahrenheit). ""They've got the immediate problem of getting supplies and food to these individuals who have been trapped for 18 days now. ... They've got to satisfy their basic needs,"" he said. ""Then, they've got the secondary problem, longer-term problem, of drilling down a 28-inch, 30-inch hole and getting it down 2,500 feet in very unstable rock conditions. And to do that, in order to make it successful, they have got to go slow. And that's the problem, is that despite the fact that everybody wants to rush, the fact is they have to use a slow drill in order to try to stabilize and get stable the hole so that they can, in fact, pull people out from that entrapment underground,"" McAteer said. McAteer told ""American Morning"" the mental and emotional components of the miners' entrapment may be difficult to overcome. ""How do you come up with things for them to do and arrange things so that they can get their attention diverted from just sitting there waiting? That's going to be the real challenge for the Chileans and for the rescuers,"" he said. ""I think the fact that they've made it these 18 days is very, very positive. But the euphoria of making contact with the surface is going to last a couple days and then it is going to be a long slope."" McAteer added that the Chilean government and counselors were helping the ""resilient"" miners, but modern technology could be the biggest boon to the caged miners' mental health. ""I see no reason why you couldn't pass cellphones down to them or computers, tethered down to them. We're in a new day. There'll need to be -- something will need to be done to divert their attention,"" he said. Chile's mining minister reiterated Monday that those responsible for the cave-in will be prosecuted, a point also made a few minutes later at a separate event by the Chilean president. ""We will investigate and punish those who are responsible,"" Pinera said. Family members had cheered Sunday when Pinera held up a handwritten note pulled from the mine. The note was tied to a probe authorities had lowered earlier Sunday. Written in Spanish in red ink, it said simply: ""We are fine in the shelter, the 33 of us.""

"(CNN) -- Former President Jimmy Carter predicted that Republicans' obstructionist ways should change and President Obama's re-election prospects could improve after next week's midterm elections. Speaking Wednesday on HLN's ""The Joy Behar Show,"" Carter said the Republican party has been ""completely irresponsible"" in the past 18 months by opposing most legislative initiatives backed by Obama and his fellow Democrats. But the nation's 39th president said that approach might not work as well, if Republicans go from the minority to the majority in either the Senate or House of Representatives. He said it could also end up leading to less of a logjam on Capitol Hill. ""If they, maybe, gain control, ... they'll have to show some responsibility, so that Obama will will have an opponent with whom he can debate with some degree of rationality,"" Carter said. Carter praised Obama for doing ""an extraordinary job"" despite numerous challenges, including an environment in which most every move he made, even if it had once been championed by Republicans, faced immediate opposition. If and when Republicans engage the White House after voters hit the polls on November 2, Obama may be more able to engage them as well as voters in drawing a clear distinction between himself and his opponents, Carter said. ""They've been able to snipe away at what he does, and (Obama) hasn't had a target to debate,"" he said. ""But that's going to change over the next two years. So I think he'll have a better chance to be re-elected than I think he (may seem to have) now."" A devout Christian and longtime Sunday school teacher, Carter also addressed recent comments from Republican senatorial candidates Sharron Angle of Nevada and Christine O'Donnell of Delaware talking openly about religion on the campaign trail. He said that it's very different from when he was president in the 1970s, because ""there's sort of a marriage between religious groups and one political party"" -- the Republicans. Carter said the growing role of money in politics had poisoned the process, not only in funding relentless rounds of negative advertising, but also when the candidates set up shop in Washington. ""That's been the main cause of the change in the political environment -- the enormous influence of vast amounts of money, (sometimes) secretly without identifying donors. A lot of that money is used in negative advertising to destroy the reputations of opponents,"" said Carter. ""That animosity, that hatred, carries over.""","Former President Jimmy Carter says Obama's re-election prospects could improve .

"(CNN) -- An Argentine government report released Tuesday alleges that two of the country's largest newspapers, Clarin and La Nacion, resorted to human rights violations against the owners of a paper company in what was an illegal appropriation of its shares. Founded in 1972, Papel Prensa is the main manufacturer of newsprint in Argentina and is owned by Clarin, La Nacion, and the government. The report alleges that the two newspaper conglomerates colluded with Argentina's dictatorship in 1976 to force the sale of the shares through torture and threats. Both newspapers have denied the claims, and say the shares of Papel Prensa were bought legally. President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner presented the 233-page report herself. The government will present the findings of the report to the judiciary to see if criminal charges will be brought against the papers. She also accused Clarin, which owns 49 percent of Papel Prensa, of managing a monopoly that put some competitors out of business and kept other newspapers from emerging in Argentina. The government is the second largest stakeholder in the company, with more than 27 percent of the shares. La Nacion owns 23 percent of the company. The report comes amid tensions between the government and the media, particularly Clarin. Clarin has been highly critical of the leadership of Fernandez and her husband and predecessor, Nestor Kirchner. Last year, Fernandez spearheaded a controversial audio-visual communication policy that critics said was aimed at hobbling the holdings of Clarin, which also has business interests in cable, television and radio. In a recent editorial, Clarin accused the government of trying to gain control over Papel Prensa in order to control the print media in the country. Fernandez agreed that whoever controls the company controls the print media, but said that Clarin has abused that power. The president announced that she would send a proposal to congress to create a commission that would regulate the production of newsprint ""as a public interest"" to make its access more equitable among publishers. Among the evidence that Fernandez cited was the price the then-owner of Papel Prensa, Linda Graiver, sold the company for. According to the report, Graiver sold it for just under $1 million, when records show the firm was worth between $2.3 million and $4 million. In the end, Fernandez said, Graiver was paid only $7,000 before she was detained by elements of the dictatorship. ""When you read this, you feel you are reading a thriller, an Argentine thriller,"" Fernandez said.","A report alleges that Argentina's largest newspapers illegally obtained shares of Papel Prensa .

"Washington (CNN) -- The message from President John F. Kennedy's January 20, 1961, inaugural address has withstood the test of time, but not the elements at his grave site at Arlington National Cemetery. To remedy that, workers Thursday began to restore the legibility of the inscription on a granite wall near Kennedy's tomb. ""Ask not what your country can do for you -- ask what you can do for your country,"" it reads in part. Generations of Americans and international visitors have thronged to Kennedy's grave and eternal flame, which lie on the slope beneath the Custis-Lee Mansion. Words from other Kennedy speeches also are on the wall, which was erected in 1965. The original engraving was done by master stone mason John Everett Benson, who was on hand Thursday to advise workers. The project is being underwritten by the Knights of Columbus. Kennedy, the first Catholic president, was a member of the Catholic fraternal organization from 1946 until his assassination in November 1963. The restoration work is being done by Gordon Ponsford, the Knights of Columbus said. The work will take about a week and will cost less than $10,000, said Knights spokesman Patrick Korten. The group noticed the weathering in August after members walked to the site after a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknowns. ""We all looked at the wall and we could not read it,"" said Korten. The organization also is sponsoring a high school essay contest to mark the 50th anniversary of Kennedy's inaugural address.

"(CNN) -- Veteran Portugal international Deco is poised to end his career in the country of his birth after agreeing to join Fluminense, the Brazilian club announced on Saturday. The 32-year-old midfielder will leave English champions Chelsea and sign a two-year contract on Monday, Fluminense revealed on the club's website. ""The vice president of Fluminense, Alcides Antunes, has officially signed Deco from Chelsea,"" a statement said. ""After intense negotiations, the player, who participated in two World Cups for the Portugal national team, got his release from the English club and will sign a two-year contract with the Tricolor. Deco will be officially presented to the press at 12:30 (local time) on Monday."" Deco, who played just once as Portugal reached the second round in South Africa, made only 14 starts for Chelsea in the Premier League last season. He struggled to make an impact in England, having been signed by former Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari in 2008. Deco, who was born in Sao Bernardo do Campo in Sao Paulo state, was previously a big hit at Spanish club Barcelona, where he won the Champions League for the second time in 2006 following his triumph with Porto two years previously. He started his career in Brazil, playing for Corinthians before Benfica took him to Portugal in 1997, and he subsequently played more than 70 times for his adopted nation. Deco will join former Barcelona teammate Juliano Belletti at Fluminense, who signed the Brazil international defender last month following his release by Chelsea. Meanwhile, Spanish midfielder Mikel Arteta has signed a new five-year contract with English Premier League club Everton, ending speculation that the 28-year-old would be leaving.","Brazilian club Fluminense to unveil signing of Chelsea midfielder Deco on Monday .

"(CNN) -- They were elected to serve their small towns, but recently, mayors throughout Mexico have found themselves the targets of violent killings believed to be perpetrated by drug cartels. As the cartels face challenges from the military and rival cartels, many of the groups have sought to increase their influence over the towns in the areas where they operate. Not only do they traffic in drugs, but cartels have diversified into human smuggling, extortion, and even into public works. A typical drug trafficking organization has a network of lookouts on city streets, ""tax"" collectors who collect protection money, and hit men who enforce their will on populations. The result has been situations where the duties of mayors -- to collect taxes, provide security, and carry out public works -- have butted against the interests of the cartels, oftentimes with fatal results. Thirteen mayors have been killed so far this year in Mexico, in states around the country. The killings represent just a fraction of all the mayors throughout the country, but illustrate a disturbing new development in the drug war. The turf wars that the cartels are fighting are reflected in the office of the mayor, said Ana Maria Salazar, a television and radio political commentator in Mexico City. ""These groups are demanding more from the mayors,"" Salazar told CNN. The cartels seek information, police protection and means of communication from the local governments, she said, adding that she was surprised that more mayors have not been killed. This year, the largest number of mayors -- four -- have been killed in the border state of Chihuahua, a hotbed of fighting between the Juarez cartel and the Sinaloa cartel. Killings have also been recorded in hot spots such as the state of Michoacan, home to the Familia Michoacana cartel. Also affected have been Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon, two border states where the Zetas drug cartel is battling an alliance comprised of the Sinaloans, La Familia Michoacana and the Gulf cartel. George Grayson, a Mexico expert and professor of government at the College of William and Mary, said that he sees the Zetas, who got their start as army defectors, as a force behind some of the killings. The Zetas have been on the defensive against the alliance that formed against them, as well as from the government forces. ""They are trying to demonstrate they are still important players,"" Grayson said. ""They want to regain the reputation they think they have lost as the most ruthless organization in the Americas."" While the Zetas are not known for doing public works, some of their illicit activities -- collecting money for protection, for example -- shadow the responsibilities of the local government. ""You are expected at least to turn a blind eye, if you are a mayor, especially,"" Grayson told CNN. Most of the violence against mayors has happened in small towns in drug cartel territory, where the leaders are more vulnerable than their big-city counterparts. One example is the small border town of Puerto Palomas, known locally simply as Palomas, in Chihuahua. A year ago this month, the mayor, Estanislao Garcia, was kidnapped and then found executed. Palomas, located across the border from Columbus, New Mexico, literally scrapes along the border with the United States. As a town, it is known as a staging area for immigrants looking to steal across the border, and lacks an industry of its own. ""It's been a difficult challenge,"" Maria Lopez, the current mayor of Palomas, said of her position. But since that killing, things have been relatively calm. ""I have not had any problems, thank God,"" she told CNN. At first, she says that she was not scared when she succeeded Garcia. Then, she restated her answer. ""I first I was scared, why should I lie? But not anymore"" No drug traffickers have come to negotiate with her on any issues, she said. Lopez says she doesn't know who killed Garcia, though speculation is that it was one of the cartels that work in the area. ""It's sad. It's truly sad. I don't know what is behind it,"" she said. Garcia had been in a quarrel with local teachers at the time of his death, but she doesn't think they were the ones who ended his life. Other killings offer more clear evidence of cartel involvement. In September, in the town of El Naranjo in San Luis Potosi, witnesses saw four armed and hooded men exit a white truck in front of city hall in the early afternoon. Two men waited in front of the building while the other two went inside Mayor Alexander Lopez's office and shot him. Other killings have been even more violent. The mayor of Tancitaro, Michoacan -- Gustavo Sanchez -- was found stoned to death on the side of the road. An aide who was with him met the same fate. Being a mayor in Mexico these days requires great courage because they face intimidation, threats and bribes, Mayor Jaime Dominguez of Ascension, Chihuahua, told CNN. ""As mayors we are under a lot of risk,"" he said. Dominguez says that he tries to focus on his job, helping the people of his community with infrastructure and water projects in his agricultural town. The only crime he is concerned with are local ones, such as robbery and domestic violence. Drug trafficking and murders fall to the state and federal authorities to investigate. ""Our job is to work closely with the community,"" he said. ""I feel safe, I feel secure. My hands are clean."" Still, he wishes for more federal and state help for issues such as social development and security. ""In a way, this (violence) was expected,"" Salazar said, referring to how cartels continue to push the limit to who they can kill. Before the mayors were targeted, cartels had been targeting police chiefs throughout the country. Grayson agreed. ""I think the death toll will rise with the mayors."" Could governors be next? A leading gubernatorial candidate in Tamaulipas state, Rodolfo Torre Cantu, was gunned down in June.","Thirteen mayors have been killed in Mexico this year .
Most are from small towns where they are more vulnerable .

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Help trickled in Thursday to remote islands where whole villages were flattened by a earthquake and tsunami in western Indonesia. At least 343 people died and another 340 were missing after the magnitude 7.7 earthquake Monday, according to Indonesia's National Disaster Agency. Meanwhile, nature continued to shows its force, with hot clouds and ash spewing from a Java volcano that erupted and killed more than 30 residents. A magnitude 5.3 earthquake rumbled in Maluku province to the east. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage there. The delivery of aid to the devastated islands near Sumatra is a logistics challenge. An assessment team from the nonprofit group SurfAid International began surveying villages on the islands of North Pagai and South Pagai, the group said Thursday. The nonprofit is one of the few to have reached the remote disaster zone. The trip takes at least 10 hours in good conditions, according to aid agencies. The hard-hit Mentawai Islands region is among Indonesia's myriad islands. ""The village of Sabeugungung has been completely wiped out, with 50 dead and 150 missing presumed dead. Sikakap hospital is overflowing with over 200 people seeking assistance,"" SurfAid said in a blog post. Ten villagers in Bosua had been killed, another was missing, and 78 houses had been destroyed, the nonprofit said. Late Wednesday, SurfAid sent 1,000 shelter kits, 500 building kits and 500 hygiene kits to victims by charter boat. Another charter boat had delivered an initial batch of supplies, including blankets, tarps and water containers, and more aid shipments were planned, SurfAid said. The group was trying to work with government officials to establish an information and coordination hub for all non-governmental organizations, spokeswoman Jossi Syahrial said. The Indonesian Red Cross also had sent at least two aid teams to the disaster zone. One aid shipment included about 400 body bags. Urgent needs are expected to include clean water, food, blankets, clothing, medical attention, emergency shelter and hygiene kits, said Ita Balanda, a program manager for the World Vision aid organization in Padang, Indonesia. An estimated 7,900 households were affected, she said. ""The worst hit area is North and South Pagai Island. Reports of villages flattened are coming from there,"" said Antorizon of the West Sumatra disaster management agency, who like many Indonesians goes by one name. The first pictures from North Pagai Island showed damaged and flattened structures. Monday's quake generated a ""significant"" tsunami, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said. Some of the missing might include people who are unaccounted for after fleeing to higher ground, said Henri Dori Satoko, head of the Mentawai Islands parliament. Though communication poses a challenge in the remote area, some witnesses in West Sumatra reported seeing a wave 6 meters (nearly 20 feet) high. Other reports described the tsunami as being about 3 meters (almost 10 feet) high. At least one village with a population of about 200 people was swept away, with only 40 people recovered, Satoko said. Indonesia's government has since warned residents of West Sumatra province to stay alert and stay away from the coastline for up to five days because of the possibility of more earthquakes, Balanda said. The city of Padang and the Mentawai Islands are at the meeting place of two tectonic plates, making them vulnerable to earthquakes and tsunamis. On December 26, 2004, a 9.1-magnitude earthquake struck off northern Sumatra. A tsunami generated by that earthquake killed more than 225,000 people in 14 countries -- mainly India, Indonesia, Maldives, Sri Lanka and Thailand. The Indonesian region of Banda Aceh was hard-hit: About 150,000 died there. To the east, on Java, the death toll from Tuesday's eruption of Mount Merapi has climbed to 32, medical officials said Thursday. Merapi, which looms on the horizon north of the major city of Yogyakarta, is one of Indonesia's most active volcanoes and lies in one of the world's most densely populated areas. The volcano has a summit elevation of nearly 10,000 feet (3,000 meters). Hundreds of displaced residents have crammed a small government building in Yogyakarta. Many had fled with only the clothes on their backs. Some refused to flee, holding out to watch over their crops and livestock. Some residents awaited word from the traditional gatekeeper of Mount Merapi. But Maradjin, the gatekeeper, fell victim to the volcano as well. He was to be buried Thursday. He died in his 80s, after being appointed about two decades ago by the last Sultan of Java. Maradjin's father was gatekeeper before him. ""Merapi is a house of spirits, which also means a living mountain,"" Maradjin told CNN in a 2006 interview. ""When Merapi emits smoke, we have to be respectful.""

"(CNN)  -- Tiger Woods may have clung on to his world number one status but after a disappointing final round at the PGA Championship will have to rely on captain Corey Pavin to play in the Ryder Cup. Woods needed to finish in the top 15 at Whistling Straits to have any chance of forcing his way into the eight automatic selections for the United States team to face Europe at Celtic Manor in October. Handily placed after three rounds, Woods stumbled to a one-over 73 to end up in a tie for 28th. ""I hit my irons really good today. I drove it terrible,"" was his verdict. His performance was certainly an improvement on a disastrous showing in the preceding WGC-Bridgestone Invitational and Woods briefly led at the start of his first round, but after that the inconsistencies crept in. ""I didn't miss a shot for the first four holes. And then after that I hit it awful,"" he added. Woods could have done with replicating the final round 67 of arch-rival Phil Mickelson, which lifted him into a tie for 12th, but not enough to surpass his fellow American in the rankings. Woods is now hoping that U.S. captain Corey Pavin will make him one of his four captain's picks. ""Corey texts me a lot so, I'm sure he'll be texting me or calling me and I'm sure we'll be talking.

"Washington (CNN) -- Latinos in the United States are divided over a host of issues, including what to do about unauthorized immigrants, a reflection of the national political controversy over illegal immigration, a national study released Thursday finds. Slightly more than half of the nation's Hispanics say illegal immigrants should pay a small fine but not be deported, according to a report by the Pew Hispanic Center. Another 28 percent of the Latino respondents to the Pew poll say unauthorized immigrants should not be punished. On the other side, 13 percent say they should be deported. Explainer: Illegal immigration 101 . Latinos also are feeling increased concerns about discrimination, again the result of the national controversy over illegal immigration, the survey found. This year, 61 percent of Latinos say discrimination is a ""major problem,"" an increase from the 54 percent who categorized it that way in 2007, Pew said. ""Asked to state the most important factor leading to discrimination, a plurality of 36 percent now cites immigration status, up from a minority of 23 percent who said the same in 2007,"" the report states. ""Back then, a plurality of respondents -- 46 percent -- identified language skills as the biggest cause of discrimination against Hispanics."" In addition, the Pew report says, Latinos are divided about the impact of illegal immigration on Hispanics living in the United States. ""Roughly equal shares say the impact has been positive (29 percent), negative (31 percent) or made no difference (30 percent),"" the report says. ""This mixed judgment stands in sharp contrast to views that Latinos expressed on this subject in 2007. Back then, fully half (50 percent) of Latinos said the impact was positive, while just 20 percent said it was negative."" The latest survey also finds that Latinos are divided over whether immigrant and native-born Hispanics are working together to achieve common political goals. About half (45 percent) say they are and about half (46 percent) say they are not. Both the native born (who comprise 47 percent of the adult Latino population) and the foreign born (who comprise 53 percent) are roughly equally divided on their perceptions of political solidarity, Pew said. ""The native born and foreign born have different views on many topics explored in the survey,"" the report says. ""For example, seven in 10 (70 percent) foreign-born Latinos say discrimination against Hispanics is a major problem preventing Latinos from succeeding in America. Less than half (49 percent) of the native born agree. ""And when it comes to their views of immigrants, fewer than seven in 10 native-born Hispanics say immigrants strengthen the country, while 85 percent of immigrant Hispanics say the same."" Although the survey found differences of opinion among Latinos, it also revealed areas of broad agreement. For example, Pew said, 86 percent of Latinos support providing a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants if they pass background checks, pay a fine and have jobs. That level of support surpasses the 68 percent of the general public who favor such a path to citizenship, Pew said. Among Latinos, 82 percent of the native born and 90 percent of the foreign born say they support providing that path. Latinos also are united in their opposition to Arizona's SB 1070, a controversial law enacted this year that authorizes police to check the immigration status of anyone who is being investigated for another suspected crime. According to Pew, 79 percent of Latinos oppose the measure, most of which has been stayed pending a lawsuit by the federal government. The Pew Research Center for the People and the Press found this year that the general population supports the law by a 2-to-1 ratio. With regard to rising concerns about a backlash triggered by illegal immigration, the Pew survey found no increase over past years in the percentage of Latinos who report that they or someone they know have been targets of discrimination or have been stopped by authorities and asked about their immigration status. About one-third of all Latinos (34 percent) say they, a member of their family or a close friend have experienced discrimination in the past five years because of their race or ethnic group, Pew said. That amount is largely unchanged from 2009, when it stood at 32 percent. Perhaps even more significantly, only 5 percent said they had been stopped by police or other authorities and asked about their immigration status, down from 9 percent in 2008. Despite the immigration controversy, Pew also found that Latinos are more satisfied this year with the direction of the United States. Thirty-six percent said they are satisfied, a significant increase over the 25 percent who said the same thing in 2008. By contrast, the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press in a late summer survey found 25 percent of the general public satisfied with the country's direction. Latinos also remain as upbeat about their lives as they were three years ago, Pew said, with 24 percent rating it as ""excellent"" and 45 percent as ""good."" About 80 percent on the nation's estimated 11.1 million unauthorized immigrants are of Hispanic origin. Latinos are the nation's largest minority. The 47 million Hispanics in the United States make up nearly 15 percent of the nation's population. About 38 percent of the nation's Latinos are immigrants. Of those, about 19 percent are unauthorized. The study results come from a new national survey of 1,375 Latino adults conducted by land line and cellular telephones in English and Spanish from August 17 through September 19, Pew said. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.3 percentage points for the full sample and larger for subgroups. The Pew Hispanic Center is a nonpartisan research organization that does not take positions on policy issues. It is part of the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan institute based in Washington that is funded by The Pew Charitable Trusts, a Philadelphia-based public charity.","The divisions come from the national political row over illegal immigration, Pew says .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) --   Lorna Irungu sits on a hospital bed looking extremely frail. She has lupus and her kidneys continue to fail. Lorna Irungu, 35, had to travel from Kenya to India to receive her third kidney transplant. ""At some point I just wanted it to be over,"" said Irungu, 35. ""I was just tired. I was really, really tired of the fighting, of the struggling, of being sick."" But Irungu did decide to fight, with the help of a very giving family. Three times she has needed a kidney transplant, and three times her family members insisted on donating. First her father donated, then her sister, and then her brother. Irungu says what she couldn't find was a doctor who would do the tricky third transplant in her own country of Kenya. When she checked in neighboring countries, the cost was impossibly high. Irungu, who's single and has no children, has no insurance. So the former television host was paying for the surgery and medicines out of her own pocket. ""When we looked at the price of getting things done in South Africa. I'm like, 'We're never gonna get there.' It's $45,000. Where do I even begin?"" The cost of a kidney transplant in the United States can be $25,000 to $150,000, also out of Irungu's price range.  Watch more on Lorna Irungu's odyssey » . So she began looking elsewhere, sending out e-mails and making phone calls to hospitals in other countries. Doctors at Fortis Hospital in New Delhi, India, were the only ones who responded to her somewhat complicated case. Dr. Vijay Kher, the hospital's director of nephrology, first talked to Irungu by phone. ""When she called me from Kenya, she was very sick,"" Kher said. ""She had uncontrolled blood pressures, and she was having fever. She had been in ICU for about three weeks."" But Irungu made it to India. Once her condition was stabilized, doctors performed the third transplant, which is a rare operation in India. Of the 1,500 kidney transplants performed at Fortis Hospital, doctors remember having done only two in which the patient was having a third transplant. Doctors had to remove one of the previously transplanted kidneys to make room for the new kidney, Kher said. Doctors said it was unnecessary to remove the three other kidneys because they were not causing harm and they didn't want to subject her to more surgery than was necessary. Even with the complications that can arise during a third transplant, the cost of it and the weeklong hospital stay in India came to about $8,000. It's a fraction of the price she was quoted elsewhere, as is the cost of the post-transplant medication. ""This last surgery, I keep saying, has been remarkable."" Irungu said. ""I haven't felt as good post transplant as I did this time around."" After three months in India, Irungu is leaving with four kidneys inside her. Irungu says for now the newly transplanted kidney seems to be working great. ""From my experience, the cost here and the quality of care is worth it,"" Irungu said. ""It's worth it because instead of you sitting wherever you are, thinking, 'This is the end for me,' or just getting depressed or getting into this struggle,  (you can) just pack up and go.""","Woman travels from Kenya to India for a tricky third kidney transplant .

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Nigeria's national security adviser has resigned from his post in order to run in the 2011 presidential election, he told CNN on Sunday. In announcing his bid for the presidency, Gen. Aliyu Gusau will compete against President Goodluck Jonathan, who appointed Gusau to his national security post earlier this year to help quell religious clashes in the city of Jos. Gusau is one of four main contenders from the country's north who announced Friday that they would put forth a single candidate to challenge Jonathan in next month's primaries for the People's Democratic Party. Gusau's announcement comes a day after Jonathan formally declared that he will run in the 2011 elections. ""I have decided to humbly offer myself as a candidate in the presidential primaries of our party, the great PDP (People's Democratic Party),"" he said Saturday. Under Nigerian ""zoning"" rules, power must shift to different regions and ethnic groups every eight years. Jonathan -- who is from the Niger Delta, in the south -- was part of the joint ticket of the late President Umaru Yar'Adua, who was from the north. Yar'Adua's death in May, after a long illness, upset the order of the zoning. Yar'Adua was elected in 2007 and his southern replacement threatened to halt the north's turn at holding power. Under an agreement with the four contenders from the north, Gusau will challenge Jonathan and the bloc will support his bid to try to win the election in favor of the north. The challenge has the potential to split the ruling party when primaries are scheduled to be held between October 18 and 20. However, Nigeria's Independent National Electoral Commission indicated in a communique Sunday that it could extend the timeline for the election. CNN's Christian Purefoy contributed to this report.","Gen. Aliyu Gusau will challenge President Goodluck Jonathan .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Hundreds of energy workers across the UK have taken strike action Friday in protest over the use of foreign workers on a multimillion-dollar oil refinery project on the northeast coast of England. Protesters gather outside the Total Lindsey oil refinery in north-east England on January 30. The dispute surrounds the decision by oil giant Total to award Italian company IREM a contract to build a new hydro desulphurization facility at its Lindsey Oil Refinery in North Lincolnshire. The British Press Association reported that several hundred demonstrators had gathered for a third day outside the plant, following a walk-out by contractors on Wednesday, but the unofficial action has now spread to other parts of the UK, including Scotland and Wales. In Scotland, hundreds of workers at the giant Grangemouth oil refinery walked out following an early morning meeting Friday. According to PA, the mechanical contractors, who work for BP and INEOS, said they were supporting their colleagues in Lincolnshire. Elsewhere, PA reported that police were called to the Aberthaw power station near Barry in South Wales after workers staged a protest, while around 400 workers staged a demonstration at the Wilton oil refinery in Teesside, north-east England. In a statement released Friday, Total said: ""We recognize the concerns of contractors but we want to stress that there will be no direct redundancies as a result of this contract being awarded to IREM and that all IREM staff will be paid the same as the existing contractors working on the project. ""It is important to note that we have been a major local employer for 40 years with 550 permanent staff employed at the refinery. There are also between 200 and 1000 contractors working at the refinery, the vast majority of which work for UK companies employing local people. ""On this one specific occasion, IREM was selected, through a fair and competitive tender process, as the most appropriate company to complete this work. We will continue to put contracts out to tender in the future and we are confident we will award further contracts to UK companies."" But Bernard McAuley, a representative of Britain's Unite union, was quoted by the BBC telling demonstrators in Lincolnshire that there was ""sufficient unemployed skilled labor wanting the right to work on that site and they are demanding the right to work on that site."" Five British companies and two European contractors bid for the work before it was awarded to the Italian firm on the basis that it was supplying its own permanent workforce, PA said. The news agency added that 100 Italian and Portuguese workers are currently on site, with a further 300 expected to arrive next month. The workers are being accommodated in large, gray housing barges moored at nearby Grimsby. Meanwhile, The Guardian newspaper reported Friday that British Prime Minister Gordon Brown was quizzed about the strikes during a news conference at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. He said: ""I understand people's worries about their jobs. I understand people's anxieties about employment across the country. But we are doing everything we can both to get economic growth moving in our country and to help people who are unemployed, to help them into new jobs.""","Dispute over Total's decision to award oil refinery contract to Italian company .

"Washington (CNN) -- Airline passengers can expect to see as well as feel new pat-down procedures at U.S. airports over the coming weeks in an effort to provide another layer of security for travelers, the Transportation Security Administration said Thursday. ""Pat-downs are one important tool to help TSA detect hidden and dangerous items such as explosives,"" according to a TSA statement sent to CNN. The TSA said passengers should continue to expect ""an unpredictable mix of security layers that include explosives trace detection, advanced imaging technology, canine teams, among others."" But it's the hands-on procedures that have at least one traveler concerned that the TSA may be going too far. Rosemary Fitzpatrick, a CNN employee, said she was subjected to a pat-down at the Orlando, Florida, airport on Wednesday night after her underwire bra set off a magnetometer. She said she was taken to a private area and searched, with transportation screening officers telling her the pat-down was a new procedure. According to Fitzpatrick, a female screener ran her hands around her breasts, over her stomach, buttocks and her inner thighs, and briefly touched her crotch. ""I felt helpless, I felt violated, and I felt humiliated,"" Fitzpatrick said, adding that she was reduced to tears at the checkpoint. She particularly objected to the fact that travelers were not warned about the new procedures. Fitzpatrick sent an e-mail complaint about her experience to the TSA that said the agency needs to get the word out so that travelers know their rights. The TSA employees ""conducted themselves in a professional manner, so my complaint is not about them professionally,"" Fitzpatrick wrote. She told the TSA the agency needs to get the word out so the travelers know their rights. ""I am appalled and disgusted at the new search procedures and the fact that passengers have not been made aware of the new invasive steps prior to entering the security area,"" Fitzpatrick wrote. ""It appears once you enter the security area, passengers forfeit their rights. There were no signs, video information, etc. at the entrance of the security area the airport. Why?"" She added: ""As an experienced traveler for work who was in tears for most of the search process, I have never experienced a more traumatic and invasive travel event!"" The TSA sent an automated initial e-mail response to Fitzpatrick saying, ""Thank you for your inquiry to the Transportation Security Administration. We have forwarded your e-mail to the appropriate group for response."" In its statement to CNN, the TSA said: ""Pat-down procedures are used to resolve alarms that occur at a walk-through metal detector, if an anomaly is detected during screening with advanced imaging technology or during random screening."" The statement also indicated that ""passengers who opt out of advanced imaging technology screening will receive alternate screening to include a thorough pat-down.""

President Barack Obama called Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on Thursday to express his ""deepest condolences"" for Russian losses in the fires, which have killed hundreds of people this summer, the White House noted. ""The president told President Medvedev that he is monitoring the situation closely, and that the United States is responding to Russia's request for technical assistance in combating the fires,"" the White House said. U.S. deliveries include ""water tanks, pumps, hand tools, fire-protective clothing, and medical kits,"" a State Department release said Friday.

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- An official with the Indian lawn bowls team has been diagnosed with dengue fever but is in stable condition, doctors confirmed Monday. Ruptu Gogoi was hospitalized on Friday, according to doctors, who suspect the 30-year-old male patient could have contracted the mosquito-borne viral disease from outside the Commonwealth Games athletes' village in New Delhi. Gogoi had complained of feeling sick a day after he arrived at the athletes village last month, said Rajiv Sagar, a spokesman for the G.B. Pant Hospital in the city. Doctors, therefore, think he may have acquired the  mosquito-borne viral disease from outside the facility, Sagar said. Dengue is the most common virus transmitted by mosquitoes in the world. It causes as many as 100 million infections and kills 25,000 people every year. Dengue is found in tropical and sub-tropical climates worldwide, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas, according to the World Health Organization. Meanwhile, after harsh criticism and controversy, the 2010 Commonwealth Games began Sunday with a lavish opening ceremony. Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium gleamed with multi-colored lights as representatives from Commonwealth countries walked the length of the field by turns, waving their flags and wearing traditional native costumes. It's the first time India has hosted the international sporting event between countries of the former British Empire. The games, held every four years, include many Olympic events as well as other sports played traditionally in those countries. Among the competitions is lawn bowling, where the object is to get more of one team's ball closer to a small white ball, or jack, than the opponent. Britain's Prince Charles and Indian President Pratibha Devisingh Patil officially declared the games open. Prince Charles was representing his mother, Queen Elizabeth. The games have been a tough act for a nation that has never hosted such a large international event. Parliament has been forced to deal with accusations of corruption in the planning of the games. Two weeks ago, gunmen fired on a tourist bus in New Delhi and injured two Taiwanese tourists. A car blaze turned out to be a crudely manufactured bomb. And a militant group warned that it planned to target the games. Indian law enforcement authorities responded with a heightened security plan, placing thousands of extra forces on the streets of the capital. If all that weren't enough, two days before athletes were scheduled to begin arriving, complaints rang out across the globe about their shoddy living quarters. ""You know, construction dust is still there, filth, excrement, it really is disgusting in parts and it really requires a professional deep clean throughout the entire complex,"" said Michael Hooper, chief executive officer of the Commonwealth Games Federation. As if to amplify Hooper's complaint, a pedestrian bridge leading to Nehru stadium collapsed that same day. Two world-class athletes canceled their trips, citing security and health concerns. Entire teams threatened to do the same, while others delayed their arrival date. Indian officials went to work on a massive clean-up effort. In the end, athletes from 71 countries showed up. CNN's Moni Basu contributed to this report.","Doctors think Gogoi may have contracted the disease outside the athletes' village .

"(CNN) -- FIFA will investigate the latest allegations of corruption which have further brought into question the integrity of the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Football's ruling body faces further embarrassment after its former secretary general was accused of identifying members of the current executive committee who are open to bribery. Committee members Amos Adamu, of Nigeria, and Oceania representative Reynald Temarii of Tahiti have already been provisionally suspended ahead of another ethics hearing next month, along with four other FIFA officials. Britain's Sunday Times newspaper, which provided evidence that led to that decision after an undercover investigation, has now released secretly-filmed video of Michel Zen-Ruffinen offering inside information on others who might be open to selling their votes ahead of the December 2 decisions on which countries will host the 2018 and 2022 tournaments. FIFA must challenge any potential corruption cancer . Zen-Ruffinen was forced out of his FIFA post before the 2002 World Cup, having prepared a report which led to FIFA taking unsuccessful legal action against president Sepp Blatter over allegations of corruption and financial mismanagement. He told undercover Times reporters that two current executive committee members could be bribed with money, another would accept sexual favors from women and that a fourth -- ""the biggest gangster you will find on earth"" -- would require a payment of $500,000. ""FIFA has already requested to receive all the documents and potential evidence that the newspaper has in relation to this matter, and will in any case analyze the material available,"" the Switzerland-based body said in a statement on Monday. ""As announced on October 20, the FIFA ethics committee decided, at the request of FIFA, to open an investigation into alleged agreements between member associations and between their bid committees in relation to the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bidding process. FIFA will provide all of the information collected on this matter to the ethics committee."" The Sunday Times reporters posed as lobbyists linked to the United States' initial bid to host one of the tournaments. The U.S. has since withdrawn from the running for 2018, meaning a European nation will host the event as only England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and Belgium-Holland remain as candidates. The Americans will bid against Australia, Japan, South Korea and Qatar for the right to host in 2022.","Soccer's governing body faces more claims of corruption in World Cup bidding process .

"(CNN)  -- France captain Thierry Henry says he considered quitting international football over the handball controversy as Les Bleus qualified for the World Cup finals at the expense of Ireland last week. Henry told the French sports paper L'Equipe that he felt ""truly alone"" as the row raged over his blatant handball to assist William Gallas for the winning goal in the playoff match with the Irish at the Stade de France. The Barcelona striker faced a barrage of criticism at home and abroad and admits he questioned his future in French colors. ""Yes, I asked myself the question.

But Henry was repentant over his celebration with teammates after referee Martin Hansson had waived away Irish appeals to award the goal. ""I should not have done it,"" he said. ""But frankly, it was uncontrollable. After all that had happened... yes, I regret it. That's why right after I spoke with the Irish one by one.""

"Paris, France (CNN) -- Former Colombian hostage Ingrid Betancourt tells the story of her six-year captivity in a book due to hit the shelves Tuesday. Betancourt, a former presidential candidate in Colombia, was held for more than six years by Marxist rebels before the Colombian military rescued her and 14 others in 2008. ""Meme le Silence a une Fin,"" or ""Even Silence Has an End,"" will go on sale around the world, the publishing house Gallimard said. In June, Betancourt filed a suit, asking for about $7 million from the Colombian government for the years she spent as a hostage. Betancourt and her family members say the government did not do enough to protect her. Betancourt was freed in a high-profile helicopter rescue mission in July 2008. Colombian commandos posed as humanitarian aid workers to free the group, which included three U.S. military contractors and 11 Colombian police and military members. In a memoir published last year, the U.S. military contractors rescued along with Betancourt painted an unflattering portrait of the dual citizen of France and Colombia, describing her as someone who hoarded belongings and let her temper flare during their time in the rebel camp. CNN's Sarah Goddard contributed to this report.","The book tells the story of her six-year captivity in Colombia .

"(CNN) -- Cattle carcasses dot the desert. More beggars show up at street corners in the capital, Niamey. These are indications that Niger is on the brink of catastrophe, say aid workers. But few outside the country have noticed these signs in one of the world's least developed nations. And now an encroaching emergency caused by months of severe drought is threatening to leave 8 million people, or half the nation's population, hungry. The United Nations' World Food Programme announced Tuesday that it is ""massively scaling up"" food distribution to people who have lost crops and livestock. In this nomadic, pastoral nation, they are people who have lost everything. ""The drought in Niger is an unfolding catastrophe for millions of people and we are struggling against time to scale up quickly enough to reach the escalating number of hungry,"" said Josette Sheeran, executive director for the U.N. agency. Sheeran traveled to Niger to see the crisis for herself and saw a landlocked, drought-prone nation where hunger has been growing steadily since the last harvest in September 2009. ""We are massively scaling up special nutritional help for children under two years of age, whose brains and bodies face permanent damage from acute malnutrition,"" said Sheeran in a statement released Tuesday after her visit. The agency said it aims to feed about 8 million people through the end of the year by distributing food rations that include a corn and soy supplement, a peanut paste and vitamin-fortified sugar and milk for children. Earlier this month, 10 leading international aid agencies had called for a surge in the humanitarian response to the hunger crisis across the Sahel region of west and central Africa -- 2 million more people are threatened in Chad and thousands others in Mali, Mauritania, parts of Burkina Faso and northern Nigeria. But Niger is at the heart. And despite months of warnings, the money for emergency aid has been what aid agencies described as paltry. The United Nations needs another $229 million to reach its recently revised target aid amount of $371 million. The World Food Programme's appeal follows a similar call by the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which earlier this month increased the aid requirement for Niger to $253 million from $191 million. The food agency said it only has half the $213 million it needs to expand its feeding operation. ""I think it has been a really slow onset emergency,"" said Johannes Schoors, chief of missions in Niger for the aid agency CARE International. ""We got very little response from donors."" That's partly because Niger's has been an invisible problem so far. There are not yet thousands of people starving. Nor are there images of distended bellies and bones piercing out of flesh, as there were in the Sudan famine in the 1990s. The markets still carry fresh fruit for those who can travel far and have deep pockets. But, Schoors said, if things are allowed to go on this way, human suffering will become unbearable. Schoors' colleague Stephane Petitprez, CARE's emergency director who just returned from 10 days in eastern Niger, said the people of Niger have no way to survive without their livestock. Their future is dying with the animals. ""They have to start a new life,"" she said. But without rain, it will be difficult.","Half of Niger's population is threatened by a food shortage caused by prolonged drought .

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- Turkish authorities have detained American activist and freelance journalist Jake Hess in the southeastern, predominantly Kurdish city of Diyarbakir. At a court appearance Sunday, a prosecutor charged Hess with ""taking orders from a terrorist organization"" and called for his immediate deportation from Turkey, witnesses said. Turkish officialdom regularly refers to the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, as a terrorist organization. U.S. diplomats say Hess rejected their offer of assistance after he was taken into custody. ""We have spoken with him on the phone regarding his situation, and he specifically asked us not to share any information on his case,"" said Deborah Guido, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in Ankara. ""He did not sign a privacy waiver. We can take an oral privacy waiver [by phone], and it was his choice. He did not want to be helped."" Asked why he rejected the American offer, Hess answered that ""the U.S. is an imperialist country, and I disagree with U.S. policy towards Turkey and the Kurds. It would be hypocritical to support an American journalist who is persecuted for human rights journalism while at the same time supporting the Turkish policy of criminalizing Kurdish political activists."" Hess spoke with CNN by telephone on Monday from the detention center in Diyarbakir. He said he was initially detained by a Turkish anti-terrorist police unit on August 11. ""I am being targeted for criticizing the Turkish government and criticizing human rights abuses,"" he said. ""The prosecutor accused me of waging a smear campaign against the Turkish republic."" Turkish officials in Diyarbakir and in the capital, Ankara, have declined to comment on Hess' case. The 25-year old American said he hoped his detention would focus attention on the arrest of hundreds of ethnic Kurds in recent years, including elected mayors from Turkey's Peace and Democracy Party (BDP), a Kurdish nationalist political party. ""Some of these people have been in custody since April 2009 without trial,"" he said. ""It's an absolutely unbelievable and outrageous injustice."" Hess is a native of New Hampshire who studied at Suffolk University and Brown University. He said he previously volunteered as an activist with several Kurdish activist organizations in Europe and in Turkey. After moving to Diyarbakir more than a year ago, Hess volunteered with the Human Rights Association (IHD), a local non-governmental organization that has reported extensively on abuses committed against ethnic Kurds during Turkey's quarter-century long war with PKK guerrillas. More than 30,000 people, most of them ethnic Kurds, have been killed in the conflict. Hess had also begun writing as a freelance journalist with the online Inter Press Service news agency, filing a report this month from Iraqi Kurdistan about periodic Turkish and Iranian artillery bombardment of Kurdish villages on the Iraqi side of the border. Hess denied charges that he was an active accomplice to the PKK, which is formally classified by the Turkish and U.S. governments as a terrorist organization. ""The only relationship I had with the PKK was maybe two months ago, when I went to northern Iraq and interviewed a PKK spokesman there,"" Hess said. Media watchdog organizations are demanding Hess's release. ""We call for Hess's immediate release. Neither placing him in pre-trial detention nor deporting him are appropriate solutions,"" said the Paris-based group Reporters Without Borders in a statement. ""Kurdish media and journalists who cover the consequences of Turkish policy towards the Kurds are too often the target of harassment, which the authorities clumsily try to justify as a necessary part of their efforts to combat terrorism."" Turkish police also briefly detained several other residents of Diyarbakir in connection with Hess's case, including Yilmaz Akinci, a respected Kurdish journalist who has worked with Reuters, National Public Radio, ABC News and CNN, and who is now a producer with Al Jazeera's Arabic language service. Akinci said Hess approached him in June, looking for work. ""He had been applying for jobs everywhere,"" Akinci said. ""He came to me and said, 'I want to be a journalist.' "" Turkish police detained Akinci at his family's home in a predawn raid Sunday. He said he later learned that security forces had secretly photographed him during his earlier meeting with Hess. Akinci said he was released later Sunday, after authorities learned that he was a journalist.","He is charged with taking orders from a terrorist organization .

"London, England (CNN) -- The three Pakistani cricket players at the center of a betting scandal have been summoned to meet their country's top cricket authorities in London, England, where the alleged fixing took place, team manager Yawar Saeed told CNN on Tuesday. Salman Butt, Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Amir may remain in London for two days for meetings with the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board, their manager said. They have not been arrested, suspended, or summoned for further questioning by police, Saeed said. Saeed made his remarks two days after allegations surfaced that gamblers fixed part of a Pakistan match against England last week. Separately, customs authorities said Tuesday that three people were arrested Sunday in connection with the scandal. They were held on suspicion of money-laundering, a representative of Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs told CNN. The head of cricket's world governing body said Tuesday he wants disciplinary action within days if anyone on the Pakistan team was involved in the alleged betting scheme. Haroon Lorgat, chief executive of the International Cricket Council, said he wants any action taken by Thursday, if at all possible, an ICC spokesman told CNN. ""The integrity of the game is of paramount importance,"" Lorgat said in a statement. ""Prompt and decisive action will be taken against those who seek to harm it. However, the facts must first be established through a thorough investigation and it is important to respect the right of due process when addressing serious allegations of this sort."" Investigators from the ICC, the sport's governing body, are already in the United Kingdom making inquiries into the allegations, the council said Tuesday. The investigators, from the council's Anti-Corruption and Security Unit, are working with London's Metropolitan Police on their criminal investigation, the council said. Federal investigators from Pakistan had been expected to arrive in England on Tuesday to look into the alleged scandal, but Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik later said their plans changed. ""We have requested Interpol and Scotland Yard to provide us with [the] preliminary report, and we have asked for permission to send our team there,"" Malik told CNN. ""The moment we get permission, we will send them."" Lorgat said that if any players are found guilty, ""the ICC will ensure that the appropriate punishment is handed out. We will not tolerate corruption in this great game."" Police have questioned four people over the scandal, Pakistani manager Saeed said Sunday. The four are Saeed, team captain Salman Butt, and two players, he said. The alleged scandal came to light Sunday when a British tabloid newspaper reported that two Pakistan players deliberately bowled ""no balls"" -- fouls -- during their four-day series with England. A ""no ball"" is when the bowler -- the equivalent of a pitcher in baseball -- steps over the line as he unleashes the ball. The batting team gets a run when that happens. The News of the World posted video of what it said was an undercover reporter meeting with a man identified as Mazhar Majeed, who tells the reporter exactly which bowlers will bowl ""no balls"" and when, then lays out 14 thick stacks of bills on a table. The video of the meeting -- which the newspaper said took place Wednesday, the day before the match between Pakistan and England began -- is intercut with clips from the following two days, where the players perform as Majeed said they would. The tabloid said the alleged ringleader pocketed 150,000 British pounds ($232,800) in the scam. The Met Police said a 35-year-old man was arrested late Saturday on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud bookmakers and released on bail Sunday. Police said no date had been set for a hearing or further proceedings, but that the investigation was continuing. Saeed did not name the two players questioned by police, but Britain's Press Association earlier reported he identified them as bowlers Mohammad Amir and Mohammad Asif. Police refused to confirm to CNN who was being questioned. The Pakistani players at the center of the scandal were free to leave the country, police said Monday. Team captain Butt said Pakistan gave 100 percent throughout the match. ""We have given our best,"" Butt said after his team lost to England. The team manager refused to comment on the report that Pakistan players intentionally committed three fouls during the match. ""No allegations are true until they are proved either way,"" said Saeed. ""So that this point in time they are just allegations. Let's wait until the case is complete."" England beat Pakistan in the four-day match at Lord's Cricket Ground, which ended Sunday afternoon, after the scandal broke. Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari ordered an investigation into the scandal, his spokesman said Sunday. He directed the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board to submit a preliminary report ""immediately,"" Farhatullah Babar said, adding that Zardari asked to be kept informed about any British investigations as well. It is the second allegation of corruption directed at the Pakistan cricket team this year. Betting on cricket matches is legal in England. CNN's Melissa Gray in London, England, and Samson Desta in Islamabad, Pakistan, contributed to this report.","NEW: Pakistan Cricket Board summons team captain and two bowlers .

"(CNN) -- A Pennsylvania woman was charged Monday with criminal homicide after forensic tests showed her to be the mother of four infants whose remains were found in her home in July, according to Berks County, Pennsylvania, District Attorney John Adams. Authorities also linked her to a fifth set of infant remains found in a nearby landfill. Michele Kalina, who has been in jail since she was arrested August 9 on charges relating to the discovery of the infants' remains at her home in Reading, was charged Monday with criminal homicide and five counts of ""abuse of corpse"" and is being held without bail, Adams said in a statement released by his office. Kalina's teenage daughter first contacted authorities on July 29, unsure of what she had discovered in the living room closet, Adams told CNN. Later that day, officers recovered the suspected remains of three infants from Kalina's apartment. ""These remains were stored in a living room closet and each infant was recovered from an individual plastic container,"" according to the district attorney's statement. ""One of the containers contained an amount of cured cement, which was later determined to have encased the remains of one of the infants."" Detectives later recovered a fourth set of infant remains at the house, and found a bone believed to be from a fifth set of infant remains in a landfill. Adams said DNA testing matched her positively to four of the five remains and a man Adams described as her boyfriend to three. Adams said both the boyfriend and Kalina's husband denied knowledge of any pregnancies. Kalina, a nurse's aide, ""always sort of wore those scrubs and hid [her pregnancies] well,"" Adams told CNN. According to the statement from Adams' office, the pathology report indicated four of the deaths were, ""consistent with asphyxia, poisoning, or neglect."" ""We may make the determination that we will charge her with four separate counts,"" Adams said. ""However, this is a very unusual case and frankly we're going to have to discuss this with our forensic pathologist."" Kalina's attorney, public defender Holly Feeney, had no comment.","Police discovered four sets of infant remains at a Pennsylvania house in July .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- India has unveiled a $35 computer prototype as part of its program to provide connectivity to its students and teachers at affordable prices. Kapil Sibal, the country's human resources development minister, displayed what he called a low-cost computing and access device in New Delhi on Thursday. The ministry said the price would gradually fall to $10 apiece. India said connectivity to all its colleges and universities is key to achieving its education goals. Home to a billion-plus population, the country's literacy rate stands at 65 percent, according to the 2001 census figures. Nevertheless, the South Asian nation has made giant strides in various areas since it opened up its economy in the early 1990s. The country ushered in a telecom revolution that delivered mobile telephony to nearly 600 million people in just a little more than a decade with highly competitive call tariffs. Now, India is preparing for another leap into the digital world. Recently, it auctioned off its airwaves for third-generation services to enable super-fast multimedia streaming of wireless. The move is aimed at bringing India's online market on a par with its booming cell-phone business through Internet penetration with technology allowing quick access, data transfer and entertainment on mobile handsets. The country has announced plans to link up all its 250,000 village councils by 2012 in a bid to plug massive broadband divides between rural and urban communities as it emerges as one of the world's few growth markets. Authorities say technical institutions involved in designing the new device are now setting up research to address price and quality issues in developing budget gadgets for students. ""The aim is to reach such devices to the students of colleges and universities, and to provide these institutions a host of choices of low-cost access devices around Rs 1,500 [$35] or less in near future,"" the human resources ministry said at the launch of the computer. Ministry spokeswoman Mamata Varma said the government aimed to introduce the new touch-screen computing tool at higher educational institutions in 2011. The ministry, she said, is expected to tender out contracts to private companies for mass production of its prototype. The Linux-based computer is equipped with an Internet browser, a PDF reader and several other facilities, she said.","India: Connectivity to all colleges is key to achieving education goals.

"Sykesville, Maryland (CNN) -- It's the dirty little secret of the racing industry. Thoroughbreds who don't make the winner's circle, are injured or simply too old to race are discarded by their owners, auctioned off -- sometimes to the slaughterhouse. Now these horses are getting new lives. The twist? Prison inmates looking for their own second chances are helping save them. In the rolling hills of Carroll County, Maryland, is Second Chance Farm. Alonzo Pickett leads a horse to the pasture to graze. ""Greek is a beautiful horse. I love him,"" says Pickett. ""I think he's a gentle giant."" The 7-year-old gelding came to the farm after a leg injury ended his racing career. Each year thousands of racehorses in the United States like Greek are sent to slaughterhouses and their meat sold overseas, according to the nonprofit Thoroughbred Retirement Foundation. That's why the foundation funds programs in eight prisons across the United States to rescue these abandoned horses and train prisoners to ""gentle"" them so they can be adopted. The inmates also have duties beyond grooming the horses. They maintain the farm buildings and the grounds. Pickett, 44, figures he has spent at least 14 years of his life behind bars. It is his third prison sentence, this time for drug possession. ""It could have been a lot worse,"" he confides. ""A lot of guys that I grew up with ... are deceased."" But Pickett maintains this will be his last time in prison and he thinks working with Greek as part of this program is what has changed him. ""It gave me a chance to really evaluate who I am,"" he says. ""Everybody thinks it's about the horses,"" says Gary Maynard, Secretary of Public Safety for Maryland prisons. Maynard saw the benefits of the program in other prison systems where he worked and brought it here. ""It's really about the men that work with the horses and what changes they go through as they learn to care for an animal, as they learn mutual trust and self-respect."" The bond between Pickett and Greek is evident as the inmate gently prods the animal for grooming and softly speaks to him. Pickett calls the bond they share a mutual support system. ""I have a chance to face my obstacles head on and to overcome [them],"" he says, and ""[Greek] knows we are here for him ... [that] we love him."" Conni Swenson worked with racehorses many years ago before coming to work for the Maryland Department of Corrections. She is the program coordinator for Second Chance Farm and says she daily observes the unconditional acceptance the horses have for the inmates as each come to trust the other. ""They learn compassion. They learn patience,"" says Swenson. ""If you have a 150-pound gentleman and you have a 1,200-pound horse and you need the horse to do something, you're not going to teach that horse to do it through brute force."" There is a striking difference between the farm and the prison, where the inmates return each night. There are guards at the farm but no bars, no razor wire. Pickett notes the atmosphere of serenity at the farm, far from what he calls ""negative conversations"" at the prison. ""You look at these grounds, the meadows, the horses grazing in the field,"" says Felicia Hinton, assistant commissioner, Maryland Department of Corrections. ""It can only put gentleness inside of you,"" she says, smiling. It's her responsibility to make sure each inmate is ready to begin life outside the prison walls. ""It gives them a sense of humanity,"" she says. Hinton calls the program an opportunity to change a life. Pickett agrees. He will be released from prison in just a few months. He plans to move to his grandfather's farm to care for his aging father. ""If I could come out here and take care of Greek every day,"" he says, ""then I can go home and take care of my father."" Hinton considers that a measure of the success of the program. ""Our responsibility is to send a man or woman out of prison a better person."" As Pickett cleans and scrapes Greek's hooves, he speaks with pride about his time at Second Chance Farm. ""I love the work and I love to know that I have a responsibility and they can depend on me for that responsibility being met."" Swenson says she believes in each of the inmates who has gone through the program. She likes to quote visitors her favorite Winston Churchill passage, ""There is something about the outside of a horse that is good for the inside of a man."" ""That is absolutely true here,"" she says. ""I see it every day.""","Inmates care for horses as part of a pre-release plan in Maryland .

"(CNN) -- Ryder Cup hero Graeme McDowell has revealed he will join the U.S. PGA Tour next year, but Europe teammate Lee Westwood insists he will not be switching allegiance. U.S. Open champion McDowell, who beat Hunter Mahan in the deciding singles match at Celtic Manor on Monday, told reporters that he plans to try to qualify for the lucrative FedEx Cup playoffs. ""I won't be playing as many events in America as, say, Luke Donald and Justin Rose, but I am taking up my card,"" the Northern Irishman said on Wednesday. ""I had one in 2006 but got injured early in that season, and now I want to give it a real try."" But world No. 2 Westwood, who can topple Tiger Woods from the top of the rankings if he finishes first or second at the Dunhill Links Championship in Scotland this week, has decided to stay on the European Tour -- which he won last year. If he succeeds, he will be the first European golfer to reach No. 1 since compatriot Nick Faldo in 1994. ""The FedEx Cup sits right in the middle of the kids' summer holidays, and I like going on holiday with them,"" said the Englishman, who has twice finished second in major events this year. ""I don't want to be dictated to by having to go to America to play FedEx Cup when it doesn't really mean that much to me. It doesn't mean enough to me, anyway. ""I think they [the PGA Tour] would like me to go and be a member there, but as of Monday evening I became an individual again and I do what's right for Lee Westwood now."" The 37-year-old could end Woods' five-year reign even if he took the next fortnight off, but has decided to defend his Portugal Masters title next week as well. ""That's not me. That's not the way I want to do it. I want to get to world number one by playing the way I have for the last two years and proving I'm the best,"" he said. Woods, who has struggled following his return to action after his well-publicized marital problems, will not play again until November, when he plays tournaments in China and Australia. Westwood is paired with Ryder Cup teammate Rory McIlroy for Thursday's opening round at Gleneagles, and the 21-year-old Northern Irishman revealed that he will be cutting back his schedule next year. McIlroy played on both circuits this year after finishing second overall in Europe in 2009, making his breakthrough triumph on the PGA Tour at Quail Hollow in May. ""I will only be playing 25 tournaments in all next year as against 29 on both tours this year,"" he said.","U.S. Open champion Graeme McDowell plans to take up PGA Tour card in 2011 .

"(CNN) -- Water testing by a private environmental engineering firm has discovered toxic chemicals in wells in a township in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania. Victoria Switzer, a resident of the northeastern Pennsylvania township of Dimock, revealed the results of the water tests from her well this week at an Environmental Protection Agency hearing on hydraulic fracturing in Binghamton, New York. Hydraulic fracturing, or ""fracking,"" is a controversial process used to extract natural gas from deep underground. Critics say chemicals used in the process can be injected into groundwater. How fracking works . Farnham & Associates confirmed that ethylene glycol, propylene glycol and toluene were present in her water, Switzer said. ""I'm fighting for my home,"" Switzer said Thursday. ""Hasn't this proven that [fracking] hasn't been done safely?"" The contaminated Dimock wells are in the Marcellus shale formation underneath parts of Pennsylvania, New York, West Virginia and Ohio, one of the largest natural gas deposits in the nation. The profitable natural gas reserve is attracting a flurry of gas companies wanting to drill. Fracking yields fuel, fear in Northeast . The tests, which were verified by three certified laboratories, found chemicals in the majority of samples taken from water wells in Dimock, said Daniel Farnham, president of Farnham & Associates, based in Scranton, Pennsylvania. ""For anybody to say this was occurring prior to drilling is ludicrous,"" Farnham said Friday. ""The water was not like this before."" In 2008, Farnham was contracted by Cabot Oil and Gas Corp., the company working in the Dimock area, to perform pre-drilling tests on numerous wells in Susquehanna County, he said, adding that he did not test for nor discover ethylene glycol, propylene glycol and toluene. Despite his latest findings, however, Farnham said he cannot reach any conclusions about the source of the chemical compounds found in the drinking water wells. ""Unfortunately no one can say that right now, until there is a way to track frac fluids,"" he said. ""And I think the gas companies know that."" Ethylene glycol, propylene glycol and toluene are on the list posted on the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's website of chemicals used by hydraulic fracturing companies in the state. But George Stark, a spokesman for Cabot Oil and Gas Corp., said his company does not use the chemicals discovered by Farnham & Associates. ""When we look at the ingredients we use in fracking and completing of wells, these chemicals are not found. Toluene is not at all used,"" Stark said. ""If you look at what Dan said, he found these and he can't trace these to fracking. ""The fact is that we don't use these chemicals,"" Stark said. The chemicals have a number of common applications and appear in products ranging from toothpaste to antifreeze, Farnham said. But they can be toxic in higher concentrations. The Department of Environmental Protection is conducting its own water tests across Dimock, spokesman Tom Rathbun said. ""We want to see if our findings agree with Farnham,"" Rathbun said. ""We want to see if we can duplicate it."" Department water tests in April across Dimock for ethylene glycol and propylene glycol were negative, and the agency is testing for ""toluene and a host of other constituents,"" he said. On Friday, Rathbun said that Department of Environmental Protection Secretary John Hanger plans to make a ""major announcement"" regarding water supplies in Dimock at the end of September. He would not elaborate about the details of the announcement. The Environmental Protection Agency concluded its final hydraulic fracturing hearing on Wednesday in Binghamton. The EPA plans to begin a study in January and release initial results by late 2012. Switzer is among a group of Dimock residents who sued Houston-based Cabot Oil and Gas in November, alleging that the company contaminated their well water with methane gas and other contaminates. In hydraulic fracturing, drillers pump large amounts of water mixed with sand and chemicals into the shale formation thousands of feet underground under high pressure. Fracturing the shale around the well then allows the natural gas to flow freely. ""This industry is cradle-to-grave,"" Switzer said. ""And this baby has teeth.""","Tests show toxic chemicals in water wells in northeastern Pennsylvania .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- HBO's ""True Blood"" is already in its third season and it is one of the most watched shows on cable. The last show on HBO to garner as large an audience was ""The Sopranos."" The show has tons of fan sites and more ""True Blood"" fanatics worldwide than you can shake a stake at. So what better time to launch a comic book right? Well, that's exactly what creator Alan Ball thought. He, along with publishers IDW and HBO, are putting out the first ""True Blood"" comic book in a series which debuts at Comic-Con. But if you think it's just like the TV show, think again. CNN recently spoke with Ball about the comic book, the show and what's next for ""True Blood."" CNN: So we are going into the third season of ""True Blood."" Alan Ball: Yeah. CNN: It's as popular as ever. There couldn't be a better time to bring out the comic book. Ball: Well, we were approached last year by some comic book publishers and it seemed like a great fit. I mean it seems like there's definitely characters and a story to fill comic books outside of the world of the show. So I said yeah, let's go for it. We got together and we talked about stories, and we came up with a story. Now issue one is ready and it's going to be available at Comic-Con on July 21. CNN: Was it hard to create this comic book series? ... The TV show is based on a book, so are you paralleling the comic book to the actual show? Ball: Well it was a little difficult for me because comics are such a distinct medium in which I have never worked. So I had to learn a little bit about the medium and what it was all about. What we decided to do was to take the characters of the show and put them in a story that's independent of the show itself, but is very true to the mythology of the show. It's not something that is dependent on the show or the show is dependent on it, which makes a lot of sense. CNN: But is it hard to essentially write two different ""True Blood"" scripts? Ball: Well, you have to stay on top of the mythology. You can't have vampires being made one way in the comic book and a different way in the show. You can't have characters having different histories in the show and another one in the comic. ... You just really have to stay true to what we call the bible of the show and not deviate from that. And that's hard. As each year goes on there's more stuff to stay on top of. CNN: The creatures are very interesting in the comic book series. Ball: There is a new creature in the comic book that is different from any creature that we've done on the show. But who's to say what's going to happen in the future. CNN: How hard was it to develop the picture for that? Ball: We actually knew what the creature was. But in terms of how it manifested physically and what powers it had to work with -- well, I sort of left that up to the artist. We knew that it was vicious, it was supernatural, it was not human, and it could do some real damage. And that sort of got incorporated into the writing of the script. CNN: Are you influenced by the fans because many times these fans know stuff that even the ""True Blood"" writers and publicists don't know about. Ball: It's true, they are very hardcore. CNN: Putting a comic book together, are you looking at some of those fan sites to see what people want or what they're saying at all? Are you influenced by that? Ball: I'm not. I personally do not go to those sites. I don't read what people post. There are plenty of people in the writers room who do and communicate things to me. I just don't have the time. And obviously I spend so many hours per day working on ""True Blood"" that in my free time the last thing I want to do is have more ""True Blood"" -- you know what I mean? I tend to read or play with my dogs or go in the canyon or something like that, because I don't want to go crazy. I want to maintain some reality. CNN: So you guys are unveiling the comic book at Comic-Con this week. Who's going to be there? What are we going to see at Comic-Con? Ball: A lot of us are going to be there -- a lot of the cast. I know that Anna and Stephen and Ryan and Sam and Rutina and Nelson and Deborah will be there. I think Joe is going to be there. I don't think Alexander Skarsgard is going to be there because he's going to be shooting a movie. I'm assuming it'll be pretty much the same group, and we have a big panel discussion. We're going to sign autographs and just sort of partake in the wackiness that is Comic-Con. It's really fun. CNN: How many comic books are in the first series? And how many will be put out? Ball: We're going to do six issues this year. I think there will be a new one every month. And then once all six issues are published, they will be bound in a special collector's anthology edition. And I'm assuming we'll do it again next year if it works out well. CNN: So where do you hope to rank in the world of comic books? Ball: Oh I don't know, I'm such a newbie. To use a ""True Blood"" term, I'm such a newbie to the world of comics that I'm not really sure. I know the comic book is really good. It's a really fun story. It's really entertaining. It's all the characters that you know and love in a new situation fighting a new adversary. You also get some very interesting back story on all the characters, which is very true to who they are. I'm very pleased with it. CNN: Since it's independent of the actual show, will you have new characters being introduced into future issues of the comic book series? Ball: There is a main story where one known character encounters this creature in a situation that they can't get out of, and each of them sort of shares a story from their past and that's where we might meet some new people. We'll see some people who may no longer exist on the show. CNN: Okay so give us a sneak peak of upcoming episodes on season three. Ball: Very soon you're going to find out something that is very important from Eric's past and that is going to motivate him and has been motivating him for years. That is a little bit of a big shocker.","""True Blood"" is capitalizing on popularity with a comic book .

"(CNN) -- His past largely defined by his World Series heroics, Jim Leyritz's future is now in the hands of a Florida jury that could send him to prison for up to 15 years for hitting and killing a woman while allegedly driving drunk. Opening statements begin Monday in the trial of the former baseball star, who is charged with two counts of vehicular manslaughter while driving drunk in a 2007 wreck. A jury of five men and one woman, plus two alternates, has been seated in the case. According to court documents, the incident began as a nighttime celebration for Leyritz, who was ringing in his 44th birthday with friends by bar-hopping in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. While driving a friend home shortly after 3 a.m. ET on December 28, 2007, his red 2006 Ford Expedition hit the vehicle of 30-year-old Freida Veitch, a Fort Lauderdale police report stated. She was thrown from her dark green 2000 Mitsubishi Montero, knocked unconscious and pronounced dead at 4:08 a.m. Blood drawn from Leyritz three hours later showed he had 0.14 percent blood alcohol level, above the 0.08 benchmark in Florida. He also failed field sobriety tests, according to police. Veitch was also legally drunk with a 0.18 blood alcohol level and was not wearing her seat belt, according to court documents. In pre-trial court actions, questions have also been raised as to whether Veitch was distracted by calls and texts on her cell phone, how fast she was driving and if her headlights were on. Still, beyond determining if he was legally intoxicated, Leyritz's fate may be most tied to one key question: whether the light he went through, prior to hitting Veitch, was red or yellow. Based on court documents, defense attorneys are also expected to argue that Veitch was to blame for the accident and there's little to nothing Leyritz could have done, sober or not. Leyritz and his passenger, Bruce Barger -- a 19-year-old who was with the former baseball star from midnight on and who was getting a ride home -- claim the light was yellow and turned red while Leyritz's SUV was in the intersection, court documents state. But a pedestrian at the scene, Garth Henry, said it was red even before Leyritz drove through. Leyritz played eleven years in the major leagues, including all or parts of eight seasons with the New York Yankees. His career highlight came in 1996, when he hit a winning home run in Game 4 of the World Series. He also hit pivotal homers during the 1995, 1998 and 1999 postseasons.

"(CNN)  -- Former German international star Lothar Matthaeus is to take charge of the Bulgarian national team, it was announced Tuesday. The much-traveled Matthaeus replaces Stanimar Stoilov, who quit after Euro 2012 qualifying defeats to England, and more damagingly, Montenegro earlier this month. ""Lothar Matthaeus is the new national team coach,"" Bulgarian Football Union president Borislav Mihaylov told a press conference Tuesday. Mihaylov said Matthaeus will be given a one-year contract with an option to extend for two more years. The 49-year-old enjoyed a glittering playing career, taking part in five World Cups and leading Germany to their 1990 triumph. He was also named as the first-ever FIFA World Player of the Year in 1991 and earned a record 150 caps for his country. Matthaeus also won Bundesliga and Serie A titles with Bayern Munich and Inter Milan. But his managerial career has been less successful and his last job was a one-year spell in charge of Maccabi Netanya in Israel and he has also coached Partizan Belgrade and Red Bull Salzburg. The former midfielder's only international experience was with the Hungarian national side from 2003-2005, leaving after they failed to qualify for the 2006 World Cup finals. His first game with Bulgaria will be against Wales next month as they attempt to get their qualifying campaign back on track in the October 8 clash. Meanwhile, Paulo Bento was confirmed Tuesday as the new Portugal coach until the end of Euro 2012. The 41-year-old, who won 35 caps for Portugal, succeeds Carlos Queiroz, who was sacked earlier this month. Real Madrid boss Jose Mourinho had been linked with the job on a temporary basis but later ruled himself out.","Lothar Matthaeus to take charge of the Bulgarian national team .

"New York (CNN) -- Not everyone expects a response when they write a letter to the president of the United States. But Caroline Jamieson got much more than she expected when her husband ended up in jail and afraid he would be deported. Jamieson, vice president of marketing at a new-media advertising company, wrote President Barack Obama in January because her husband, Hervé Fonkou Takoulo, was facing deportation to his native Cameroon. Takoulo failed in a bid before political asylum almost a decade ago, and a judge issued a deportation order after they were married. After he and Jamieson married on 2005, Takoulo applied for a green card based on his marriage to a U.S. citizen. But immigration law requires that the deportation order be lifted before the couple can appear before immigration officials to argue their case that the marriage is legitimate and not a ploy to legalize Takoulo's presence in the United States. ""We want to be given the chance to interview and prove that we are a married couple, so Hervé can get a green card, and that has proven extremely difficult to do,"" Jamieson told CNN. They never received a direct response to the letter. But they did get two Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers waiting outside their East Village, Manhattan apartment on June 3 when Takoulo was leaving the apartment to go to the gym. Jamieson told CNN that the officers cornered her husband and asked him if he had written a letter to the president. ""He said 'No, but my wife did.' And they explained that with that letter -- when it was brought to their attention -- that the Obama administration wanted them to resolve this quickly,'"" Jamieson said. Her husband was held at ICE headquarters for six hours, alone in a room, until he was chained at the wrists, around his stomach and his ankles and taken to the Hudson County Correctional Center in New Jersey, she said. For the next two weeks, a frantic Jamieson wrote letters to politicians and anyone else who might be able to help. She got responses, she said, but none seemed to lead anywhere. Takoulo was allowed to call his wife once a day at designated times but he knew little about his situation. He spent his days with repeat sex offenders and men accused of felonies, fearing imminent deportation. ""I did everything I could and went into survival mode and pushed for all these connections to the press,"" she said. ""We are fortunate to have that leverage. What about the people in the country who don't have access to those means?"" Then, on Thursday, he was brought to an immigration processing jail in Manhattan and released. There was no explanation offered for his release, but Takoulo is now wearing an electronic ankle monitor while his case is being reviewed. ICE spokesman Brian P. Hale said the circumstances of Takoulo's arrest were undergoing an internal review and he was released as ""an alternative to detention pending a review of his case."" Investigators are looking to determine whether ""appropriate separation"" between Jamieson's letter to the president and Takoulo's deportation case were violated. If so, he said, the case will go to the ICE Office of Professional Responsibility and the Homeland Security Department's inspector general for ""immediate and appropriate action."" Takoulo graduated from the State University of New York at Stony Brook with an engineering degree in 2008 and received several job interview offers after graduation. But the deportation order hung over his head and prevented any followup. ""All he wants to do is contribute to this economy,"" Jamieson told CNN. ""We want to be a productive couple. He's been dying to work."" The couple has been following Barack Obama's rise in the political world since 2004. ""I felt a special kinship to him because I'm of mixed race, and my husband obviously has a similar background,"" Jamieson told CNN. Regardless of whether or not her letter was mishandled, the incident has deeply affected the couple's faith in the Obama administration. ""I feel really confused, I don't understand how something like this is possible. I can't imagine that at the top of the Obama administration that they realize that something like this is happening,"" Jamieson told CNN.","Woman sends letter to President Obama about fears of husband being deported .

"Srinagar, India (CNN) -- The Indian army accused Pakistani troops of violating a cease-fire agreement early Thursday by firing across the Line of Control that divides Kashmir. Pakistani border troops fired for about 90 minutes in Poonch district of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, said Biplab Nath, an Indian army spokesman. The Pakistanis used heavy volumes of small arms, and heavy caliber weapons such as mortars and rocket propelled grenades, Nath said. Indian troops retaliated ""appropriately"" to the ""unprovoked"" firing, he said. A spokesman for the Pakistani military confirmed the gunfire, but said Indian troops fired at their soldiers. Spokesman Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas said the two nations have agreed to meet soon to discuss the incident and seek clarification. Nath said there were no casualties on the Indian side. ""Our assessment is that this firing was to primarily assist infiltration of terrorists,"" he said. Such ceasefire violations have been common since 2003, but Nath described the latest incident firing as ""major."" Kashmir has been a source of bitter dispute between India and Pakistan since the independence of both nations in 1947. Under terms agreed by the two countries, Kashmir's rulers could either opt to merge with India or Pakistan or remain independent. One part sided with Pakistan. The ruler of the other part sided with predominantly Hindu India, sparking a controversy among the region's Muslim majority. India and Pakistan have fought three wars over Kashmir and militants, who India says are backed by Pakistan, have been fighting since the late 1980s to end Indian rule in the region. A cease-fire to end the violence was agreed to in 2003. Both India and Pakistan routinely accuse each other of firing across the border.

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- A lot of work remains to be done at the venues and athletes' village at the Commonwealth Games in India, just a week before they are due to begin, the head of the games said Saturday. ""It's not over yet. There is still a lot of work to be done,"" said Mike Fennell, president of the Commonwealth Games Federation. Fennell spoke to reporters in New Delhi after a week of criticism and concern about safety and security, and the apparent poor state of the athletes' accommodation. He said the Indian organizing committee was ""responding to the needs in a very positive way"" and that now was not the time for finger-pointing, with the games due to open Oct. 3. ""I'm well aware that we could say to them this should have been done before, yes, but right now we're concentrating on getting it right, and all systems are geared toward ensuring that the remedial work that's necessary is done and completed in time,"" Fennell said. The ""great concern"" remains safety and security at the athletes' village and making sure the buildings are equipped with the necessary fire and alarm systems, Fennell said. Organizers scrambled to pull the games together after a pedestrian bridge at a stadium collapsed Tuesday and officials called village accommodation uninhabitable and filthy. Pictures emerged showing soiled rooms that included excrement, exposed wiring, and animal footprints on a mattress. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and other top officials got involved. Indian Home Minister P. Chidambaram told CNN on Friday that all security issues had been addressed and that the midnight Friday deadline to clean up the venues was met. Chidambaram said 10 of the 11 village venues had been taken over by security, with another to be taken over shortly. More than 1,000 cleaners entered the athletes' village Friday, armed with brooms, mops and other cleaning supplies to get the facility into shape. Asked why there hadn't been more monitoring of the progress in the seven years since New Delhi was awarded the games, Fennell said on the contrary, he has noted the poor progress before. ""Last year, when I paid a visit, I made some very critical remarks about what needed to be done, and there were a lot of people that were upset about those remarks at the time,"" Fennell said. ""But I said far more needed to be done very urgently, and I have had visits subsequently ... and we pointed out all along the way what needed to be done. So this is not something that was just discovered now."" Fennell said it is the local organizing committee that is ultimately responsible for the preparation of the games. He pointed out the committee depends on developers to deliver the venues on time, though he said organizers must monitor the progress of that construction. New Delhi organizing committee Chairman Suresh Kalmadi said Fennell was not singling out organizers for blame. ""We have taken on the venues a little late, and that's where the problems came,"" he said. As head of the committee, ""I will take on the blame,"" he said, ""but I wish the venues were handed over to me last year."" Concerns about the conditions for the New Delhi games have prompted some teams like Canada and New Zealand to delay their departures and some athletes to cancel their trips altogether. Other teams, like Scotland and Wales, departed for the games after receiving assurances from organizers. English diver Peter Waterfield on Saturday became the latest athlete to withdraw, citing security fears and conditions at the village. ""I have a wife and two young children who were very concerned about me attending the event and this decision is one that we have made as a family,"" said Waterfield, an Olympic and Commonwealth Games medalist. ""My decision to pull out of the Commonwealth Games has been especially hard because I am probably in the best form I have ever been in at the moment."" Such concerns led to the withdrawals Friday of New Zealand cyclist Greg Henderson and four British cyclists -- Peter Kennaugh from the Isle of Man, Geraint Thomas from Wales, and Ian Stannard and Ben Swift from England. The withdrawal of the four British cyclists was confirmed by Team Sky, their professional cycling team. The Commonwealth Games take place every four years among members of the former British empire. Fennell defended the decision to give the games to India and called it the right host for the competition. ""We've got to give these people an opportunity to learn how to host these events,"" he told Olympic news website Around the Rings after arriving in New Delhi. ""India's the largest Commonwealth country that we have, with 1.2 billion people. How will you ever know unless they're given an opportunity to make an effort?""","Mike Fennell says a lot of work still needs to be done at the games .

"(CNN) -- A flu shot can do more than just fight against influenza, a new study suggests. It may also fight against heart attacks. Adults who take the flu vaccine may be less likely to get their first heart attack the next year, researchers say. The study, published Monday in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, was conducted to add to other studies that suggested that there is a link between respiratory infections and heart attacks. ""By the nature of the study, it does not prove cause and effect. So it does not prove that the flu vaccine prevents heart attacks. But it does show that the flu vaccine is associated with the reduction,"" said Niro Siriwardena, one of the authors of the study and a professor at the University of Lincoln in England. British researchers, who conducted the study, compared the medical records of a little more than 16,000 first-time heart attack victims age 40 and older with the records of nearly 62,700 people who had not had heart attacks. After factoring other major risks for heart attacks, such as smoking and family history of heart ailments, the research found that the flu shot was associated to a 19 percent reduction in the rate of first heart attack, the study found. And the benefit was even more for those that received flu shots earlier in the flu season. Those who got the shots early had a 21 percent reduction in the rate of heart attacks in the next year, the study found.","NEW: Study does not prove cause and effect, researcher says .

"London, England (CNN) -- Artwork that used to adorn the walls and halls of Lehman Brothers' offices in London is expected to fetch two million pounds ($3.1 million) when it goes up for auction Wednesday. Christie's auction house in London is selling the art, which includes works by Lucian Freud and Anthony Gormley, antique maps and surveys, Chinese ceramics, and even Lehman Brothers signs. Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in the United States two years ago following a nearly $4 billion loss, the failure of buyout negotiations with Bank of America and Barclays Capital, and the refusal of U.S. regulators to offer a government-backed bailout. At the same time, Lehman in the United Kingdom went into liquidation, with administrators PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) appointed to sell off the assets. Christie's said there are many people who may like to own art with a Lehman connection. ""We look forward to presenting what is a fascinating glimpse into the history of what was a giant of the financial world,"" said Benjamin Clark, director of corporate collections at Christie's London. The sale takes place Wednesday and the art will be up for public viewings starting this weekend. Barry Gilbertson, a partner at PWC, said the auction date was chosen to coincide with the second anniversary of the Lehman collapse. Old masters up for sale include seascapes and naval scenes. Tea caddies, cigar boxes, porcelain, and leather-bound books including the works of Charles Dickens, Samuel Johnson, and William Shakespeare are also being offered. Modern art includes ""Madonna"" by Gary Hume, once described by the Guardian newspaper as ""disconcertingly featureless,"" and estimated between 70,000 and 100,000 pounds ($110,240 and $157,000). Two etchings by Lucian Feud are also up for sale. Lehman Brothers corporate signs, including a plaque commemorating then-Chancellor Gordon Brown's opening of the European headquarters in 2004, estimated at 1,000 to 1,500 pounds ($1,566 to $2,349), are also available. Lehman Brothers has its roots in Montgomery, Alabama, where Henry Lehman -- who had emigrated from Bavaria -- founded a convenience store in 1844. His brothers, Mayer and Emanuel, soon joined the business and later steered it toward the local cotton trade. They opened an office in New York, which became their headquarters, and in 1870 Mayer Lehman was one of the founding members of the New York Cotton Exchange. It was the earliest commodities exchange in the city and still exists. The company developed into primarily an investment bank by World War I. ""The brothers Lehman collected artwork which adorned their offices since the 19th century,"" Gilbertson said. ""Over the subsequent years, of course, as the business expanded and the leadership changed, so did their corporate taste in art.""","The art and signage used to be at their offices in London .

"San Bruno, California (CNN) -- California Sen. Barbara Boxer demanded answers Saturday to questions about why a gas transmission line ruptured in a suburban San Francisco town, triggering a massive fire that killed four people and left five people missing. Accompanied by state and federal officials, Boxer toured blocks of the charred neighborhood in San Bruno that now looks like a war zone. The Democratic senator saw firsthand the intensely hot fire's wrath: melted cars, burned out skeletons of houses. At a news conference later, she said it was hard to put into words how a beautiful neighborhood almost disappeared. ""Many questions must be answered by all of us whose job it is to protect our people,"" Boxer said. ""What was the cause of this blast of course, first and foremost?"" she asked. ""Were there reports that there were odors escaping from the pipeline? If there were those reports, what actions took place in response to those complaints? Were emergency systems such as water supply up to the task? Was the gas flow shut down as quickly as possible? Does danger lie in similar pipelines in populated areas?"" Lt. Gov Abel Maldonado said he has written a letter to the California Public Utilities Commission, seeking information on gas pipelines across the state, including their age, inspection dates and records. New remains were found in the debris left by the large fire, Steve Firpo, a city spokesman, said on Saturday, though he could not immediately confirm whether they were human. He had initially told CNN two more bodies were found. San Bruno Police Chief Neil Telford said five people were still missing. Residents packed a town hall meeting later Saturday, seeking answers from public officials about when they can go home and other rebuilding and compensation issues. Pacific Gas and Electric President Chris Johns said the company has been scouring phone records and so far, there is no evidence that complaint calls were placed. Nor was there evidence, he said, that utility crews had been in the area Thursday, the day of the blast. Firefighters were able to fully contain the blaze Friday, but federal and state investigators had not yet determined the cause. ""We are not hear to determine liability or blame, but we are here to determine the cause of the accident,"" National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Vice Chairman Christopher Hart said. Hart said the 30-inch natural gas pipe was installed in 1956. ""We have seen that piece of pipeline that was blown away, and it is really quite amazing to see this huge piece of pipeline blown the distance it was blown,"" he said. Hart said investigators will look closely at the pipe's welding and whether the pipe properly emitted an odor that may indicate a gas leak. There have been allegations of a smell in the neighborhood at least a week before the blast. Officials have identified three of the dead. Rescue workers initially feared the death toll would climb higher as they combed through the smoldering scene with cadaver dogs. Jacqueline Greig, 44, and her 13-year-old daughter Janessa were killed, San Mateo County Deputy Coroner Michelle Rippy said. A third victim was identified as Jessica Morales, 20. Another 52 people were injured, including three patients who were taken to the hospital with third-degree burns and four firefighters who suffered from smoke inhalation. Boxer assured those affected by the fire that state and federal authorities would do all they could in ensuring recovery. ""We must leave no stone unturned,"" she said about getting assistance to the devastated community. Some residents remained in shelters and watched the harrowing drama unfold on television in a Starbucks or other restaurants at the Bayhill Shopping Center. Patty Blick did not know whether to laugh or cry. Anger, she told CNN iReporter Brad Bailey, has not yet set in, even though she watched her entire block burn to the ground and her home of seven years vanish into ashes. Blick was still worrying about some of her neighbors. She didn't know whether they were lying in a hospital or whether they had escaped unscathed. Outside in the parking lot, food and other donated items piled up as San Bruno residents chipped in to help their neighbors. One person even left a baby stroller. The NTSB investigation will include analyzing many aspects of the blast and its aftermath, Hart said, including the history of the pipeline, the training and performance of its operators, emergency response and injuries sustained. Employees involved in operating the pipeline have been tested for drugs and alcohol, he said. The fire destroyed 37 homes and damaged eight, California Emergency Management Agency Secretary Matthew Bettenhausen said. Those numbers were considerably lower than the estimate of roughly 170 homes that NTSB's Hart originally said were affected by the blaze. Companies operating natural gas transmission pipelines reported an average of one death per year from 2004 to 2008, a February report from the Congressional Research Service. Carl Weimer, head of the watchdog group Pipeline Safety Trust, told CNN that, unfortunately, when it comes to pipelines, for most of the public it's ""out of sight, out of mind."" ""I'm betting in San Bruno most people didn't even know the pipeline was under their neighborhood,"" he said. Weimer noted that there can be multiple causes for a pipeline failure, including unintentional excavation-related damage and, more often, age and corrosion.

"(CNN) -- Two decades ago, the Americans with Disabilities Act was signed into law, becoming a hallmark of American civil rights legislation. The act forbids discrimination against individuals with disabilities in a range of areas like employment, access to public facilities, transportation and telecommunications. Over the last 20 years, sidewalk ramps have been installed and accessibility to most public places has been improved. Yet, vehicles largely have been ignored. But that's about to change. Vehicle Production Group, a Miami, Florida-based company plans to start production of the MV-1, which stands for first mobility vehicle, at a plant in Mishawaka, Indiana, late this year. ""This is the first vehicle that's been built from the ground up for wheelchair accessibility and the only vehicle that's factory-produced that meets the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act,"" according to Dave Schembri, the CEO for Vehicle Production Group. Schembri said there are 54 million Americans who have some kind of of disability, with 4 million of them being wheelchair dependent. Those needing wheelchair accessibility typically have to convert a new or used vehicle, including the addition of a ramp, which Schembri says compromises vehicle's structural integrity. That, he said, negates the safety ratings of the vehicle and negates the factory warranty as it pertains to those modifications. ""Our vehicle, you drive up the ramp, and you turn right and immediately you're sitting in the prime seat of the vehicle which is shotgun next to the driver,"" Schembri said. During a test drive, Schembri said he took a friend of his, who is a member of the New York Knicks wheelchair basketball team, out to lunch. ""He's sitting there having a sandwich and his coke and he says 'I'm sitting in the front seat using a cup holder looking out the front window of this car. And I can't even remember the last time I did that,'"" Schembri said. Smaller than your typical passenger van converted to handle wheelchairs, the MV-1 will be rated as a car, standing about five-feet tall. The 36-inch door opening and access ramp complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act, while fitting nearly every size wheelchair. Schembri said he expects the MV-1 to start below $40,000, noting the company has received 4,000 reservations.","The new vehicle is made for wheelchair-bound passengers .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israel's anti-missile system, the Iron Dome, will become operational within four months, the Israeli Defense Ministry said Monday. The security system -- which was designed to protect Israel from short-range missiles and rockets -- is part of a larger defense system that includes protection from mid- and long-range missiles, intended to protect Israel from a possible Iranian attack, the ministry said in a statement Monday. Video released by the ministry shows the interception of Grad and Qassam-like rockets, similar to those launched into Israel from Gaza in recent years and from Lebanon during the second Lebanon war of 2006. Israel has considered rockets and missiles the main threat to its security since it withdrew its troops from southern Lebanon in 2000 and from Gaza in 2005. ""This is an important landmark for the security system and the security industries,"" Defense Minister Ehud Barak said in a written statement. ""We will work to station the systems on the ground as soon as possible."" ""The importance of the new system is major,"" concurred Ron Ben Yishai, national security and defense commentator for Yediot Aharonot newspaper and its website, known as Ynet. ""The IDF can easily identify and target heavy missiles before being launched because of the time required to prepare them, whereas short-range rockets can easily be hidden behind any bush or house in southern Lebanon,"" he said. ""It is the lighter -- up to 70 kilometers range -- rockets that pose the serious nuisance to the Israeli population."" In Washington, the White House is asking Congress to approve $205 million to help Israel build the system, Obama administration officials said. White House spokesman Tommy Vietor explained the administration's rationale, saying, ""The president recognizes the threat missiles and rockets fired by Hamas and Hezbollah pose to Israelis."" According to an Israeli defense ministry spokesman, the cost of developing and manufacturing the first two batteries was approximately $218 million. The cost of each additional battery is estimated at $13 million and rises to $21 million with the addition of radars and missiles. ""A good coverage of Israel's borders requires 15 to 20 batteries,"" Ben Yishai said. He said he believes the advantages of the system justify the cost. ""Each intercepting missile costs the IDF $50,000, yet the price should not be compared to the cost of the cheap Qassam but rather to the cost of the damages it causes both in human lives and in property. When examined this way, (the) equation is clear."" The funds proposed by the White House are expected to pay for up to nine more Iron Dome batteries. Two senior administration officials said the $205 million would be in addition to the $3 billion the United States spends each year to support Israel's defense. One senior administration official said a U.S. team traveled last fall to Israel to see work on Iron Dome, and concluded that it was ""a system that made sense."" Another senior administration official said the funding is part of an ongoing partnership between the United States and Israel to promote steps ""we can jointly take to improve Israel's security."" Israel's short-range rocket-defense system is ""one of the security measures we've been talking (about) with them over time,"" the official added. The Obama administration is helping Israel enhance its security systems, in part, to address Israeli fears that the establishment of a Palestinian state would create a safe launching pad for rocket attacks. The batteries ""can be transferred anywhere within Israel within a matter of hours,"" the defense ministry said.","NEW: ""The importance of the new system is major,"" said YNET commentator .

"(CNN) -- Retired baseball star Roger Clemens says he's looking forward to fighting perjury and other charges brought against him Thursday and again denied he ever used performance-enhancing drugs. A federal grand jury in Washington has charged the seven-time Cy Young winner with perjury, obstruction of Congress and making false statements over his insistence to a House committee that he never used steroids or human growth hormone. ""I never took HGH or steroids. And I did not lie to Congress,"" Clemens said in a statement posted on the website Twitter. ""I look forward to challenging the government's accusations, and hope people will keep an open mind until trial. I appreciate all the support I have been getting. I am happy to finally have my day in court."" Clemens left baseball in 2007 after 24 seasons in the major leagues, during which he played for the Boston Red Sox, Toronto Blue Jays, Houston Astros and New York Yankees. He was the first pitcher to win seven Cy Young awards, ranks third in all-time career strikeouts with 4,672 and ninth in all-time wins with 354. The charges stem the longtime pitcher's February 2008 appearance before the House Oversight and Government Affairs Committee. Both Clemens' former trainer, Brian McNamee, and a report by former Sen. George Mitchell stated that Clemens had used banned substances at points in his career. Rep. Henry Waxman, then the committee's chairman, said perjury and false statements ""are serious crimes that undermine the ability of Congress to perform its duties."" ""Whether he committed a crime will be up to the judge and jury,"" the California Democrat said in a written statement. But he said the investigation, which Waxman and then-ranking Republican Tom Davis requested, ""are important actions to protect the integrity of the Committee's oversight work in this area and to help end the use of steroids and performance enhancing drugs in professional sports."" During the February 2008 hearing, Clemens vehemently denied using performance-enhancing drugs. Steroid use ""is totally incompatible with who I am and what I stand for,"" he told lawmakers, adding, ""I cannot in good conscience admit to doing something that I did not do, even if it would be easier to do so."" The six-count indictment, returned by a grand jury in Washington, states that Clemens ""did corruptly endeavor to influence, obstruct, and impede"" the congressional investigation into the use of steroids by him and other major league players. It includes three counts of making false statements to investigators about the use of human growth hormone, steroids and vitamin B12, and two counts of perjury stemming from his appearance before Waxman's committee in 2008. That testimony put him at odds with McNamee as well as one-time Yankees teammate Andy Pettite, who told a league investigation led by Mitchell that Clemens admitted using human growth hormone. A few weeks later, the committee's leaders asked the Justice Department to launch a perjury probe of Clemens. Clemens' lawyer, Rusty Hardin, told reporters Thursday that the pitcher expected the indictment. ""Roger has known from the very beginning that if he chose to publicly deny the accusations in the Mitchell report, that this day would come,"" Hardin said. He said he warned Clemens he would be called before the House committee if he issued that denial, and if he repeated it in front of Congress, he would likely face perjury charges . If he had used steroids, ""All he had to do was just admit he did it and move on like Andy,"" Hardin said. But he added, ""I think people will understand sometimes the government's wrong."" ""Now that they are ready to move forward, we are too, and we'll let everything get taken care of in the courts,"" he said.

"Paris, France (CNN) -- All 12 of France's oil refineries have reopened after being shut down for two weeks or more following a series of massive union-led actions protesting the government's planned pension overhaul. Strikes ended Friday at all six of Total's refineries, according to a spokesman for that company. It should take about a week for those facilities to start producing fuel again. Yves le Goff, a spokesman for the French Union of Petroleum Industries, said industry leaders planned to meet Friday afternoon to discuss the situation. The refineries and the nation's 219 petroleum depots were targets this month when hundreds of thousands of people hit the streets to rail against a plan to raise the retirement age from 60 to 62. Unions call the move unfair, though France's government say it is critical to keep public finances in order. The latest round of nationwide protests took place Thursday. France's Interior Ministry estimated that 560,000 people demonstrated, while unions -- six of which called for the protest, along with another one planned for November 6 -- put the number at a much higher 2 million. A day earlier, the lower house of France's parliament approved the controversial pension reform bill; the Senate had approved it Tuesday. But lawmakers can still force the bill to go to the Constitutional Council before it becomes law. The opposition Socialist party has said it will try that route, which requires 60 legislators. The pension plan is the latest in a continuing round of moves by President Nicolas Sarkozy's administration to pare down France's deficit and curtail government spending. While many nations in Europe and elsewhere have undertaken or proposed major cuts, such moves are especially significant in France, where historically one in four jobs has been tied to the public sector. Already, 40,000 teachers and staff have been laid off since 2008 in schools and universities. And 54,000 military jobs are set to be lost through 2015, per a plan announced two years ago. The government says that another 100,000 civil service jobs have been cut since Sarkozy took office in May 2007. CNN's Winnie Andrews contributed to this report.","NEW: All of France's 12 oil refineries have reopened after several strikes ended Friday .

"Washington (CNN) -- A Virginia man was arrested Wednesday for allegedly attempting to help others he thought were members of al Qaeda in planning multiple bombings at Metrorail stations in the Washington area, the Department of Justice said. Farooque Ahmed, 34, appeared briefly Wednesday before federal Magistrate John Anderson at the U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia. The court will appoint an attorney for Ahmed, and he was ordered to remain in custody until a detention hearing Friday, said Peter Carr, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Alexandria. A federal grand jury returned a three-count indictment against Ahmed on Tuesday, the Justice Department said in a statement. ""In announcing this arrest, officials emphasized that at no time was the public in danger during this investigation and that the FBI was aware of Ahmed's activities from before the alleged attempt began and closely monitored his activities until his arrest,"" the statement said. ""The public should be assured that there was no threat against Metrorail or the general public in the Washington, D.C., area."" Metrorail is the name of the subway system that serves the greater Washington area, including suburbs in northern Virginia and south-central Maryland. Ahmed is charged with attempting to provide material support to a designated terrorist organization, collecting information to assist in planning a terrorist attack on a transit facility and attempting to provide material support ""to help carry out multiple bombings to cause mass casualties"" at the Washington-area stations, authorities said. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of 50 years in prison. An administration official said Wednesday that Ahmed has no known connections to any overseas terrorist groups or individuals. The investigation is continuing, the official said on condition of not being identified. White House press secretary Robert Gibbs told reporters the arrest is ""another important example"" of work by the FBI, all levels of law enforcement and the national security team ""to keep our country safe."" ""At no point was the public in any danger,"" Gibbs said. In a statement, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority said, ""This arrest reinforces the need for continued vigilance by Metro and its customers."" Carr said Ahmed was dressed in casual clothes and had a long beard at the court appearance, where he appeared reserved and ""addressed the judge respectfully."" Ahmed was arrested at 9:40 a.m. Wednesday at a hotel in Herndon, Virginia, according to Carr. Ahmed attempted to assist others ""whom he believed to be members of al Qaeda"" from April through Monday in planning multiple bombings at the stations, according to the indictment. Federal authorities declined to provide further information on the identities of the purported al Qaeda members who allegedly were in contact with Ahmed. On April 18, Ahmed allegedly drove to a hotel in Dulles, Virginia, and met with a courier who he thought was affiliated with a terrorist organization, the indictment said. That person ""provided Ahmed with a document that provided potential locations at which future meetings could be arranged,"" the Justice Department said, citing the indictment. On May 15, Ahmed allegedly agreed to ""watch and photograph"" a Washington hotel as well as a Metrorail station in Arlington, Virginia, ""to obtain information about their security and busiest periods,"" the department said. Ahmed, a naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in Pakistan, ""allegedly participated in surveillance and recorded video images of Metrorail stations in Arlington, Virginia, on four occasions,"" the statement said. On or about July 19, in a Sterling, Virginia, hotel room, Ahmed allegedly gave a memory stick containing video images of the station to ""an individual whom Ahmed believed to be affiliated with al Qaeda,"" according to the indictment. That same day, he allegedly agreed to assess the security of two other Metrorail stations in Arlington as possible locations of terrorist attacks, the Justice Department statement said. And in a Herndon hotel room on September 28, Ahmed allegedly handed over a USB drive containing images of two Arlington Metrorail stations to a person he thought was affiliated with al Qaeda, authorities said. He also allegedly provided diagrams he drew of three Arlington Metrorail stations and provided suggestions as to where explosives should be placed on trains at the stations ""to kill the most people"" in simultaneous attacks planned for 2011, the Justice Department said. ""Today's case underscores the need for continued vigilance against terrorist threats and demonstrates how the government can neutralize such threats before they come to fruition,"" said David Kris, assistant attorney general for national security. ""Farooque Ahmed is accused of plotting with individuals he believed were terrorists to bomb our transit system, but a coordinated law enforcement and intelligence effort was able to thwart his plans."" CNN's Jeanne Meserve, Dan Lothian, Carol Cratty and Devon Sayers contributed to this report.","Source says suspect has no known terrorism links .

"(CNN) -- The body of Edelmiro Cavazos Leal, the mayor of the city of Santiago in Nuevo Leon state, was found Wednesday, two days after he was abducted, Mexico's interior ministry announced. His handcuffed and blindfolded body was found on the outskirts of Santiago along a road leading to a tourist attraction, the state-run Notimex news agency reported. There were signs of torture, Notimex said. Interior Minister Jose Francisco Blake Mora said he will travel to Nuevo Leon to confer with local officials. Nuevo Leon, which borders Texas, has been the frequent site of drug cartel violence, especially around the state capital of Monterrey. Santiago is on the outskirts of Monterrey. Cavazos was kidnapped by gunmen early Monday, Nuevo Leon state officials said at a news conference later that day. Mexican President Felipe Calderon lamented the killing Wednesday. ""Edelmiro's death makes us indignant and obligates us to redouble our fight against these cowardly criminals who kill our citizens,"" Calderon posted on the online service Twitter. More than 28,000 people have been killed in Mexican drug violence since Calderon initiated a crackdown against the cartels shortly after coming into office in December 2006.","NEW: His bound and blindfolded body was found with signs of torture, Notimex says .

"Zhouqu, China(CNN) -- A day after a miraculous rescue, the sounds of cheers were replaced by crying families, the roar of bulldozers and dynamite blasting debris in Zhouqu, China, on Wednesday. More than 24 hours after a man was pulled from the debris of his collapsed home, the grim reality is setting in that the death toll in the region is rising rapidly. Recovery teams pulled another dead body from one destroyed building. Another group carried what appeared to be the remains of a young child through the streets. The bodies are delivered to a makeshift morgue just outside the city. The roads in are also jammed with trucks carrying hundreds of coffins, along with the much needed supplies of water, food and medicine. The official death toll stands at 702, with more than a thousand still reported missing after mudslides and flooding engulfed this ethnic-Tibetan city in northwest China Saturday night. One village of 300 houses that local people said was home to more than 2,000 people was completely wiped out. The mud is becoming a threat to rescue teams as well. Pockets of air remain just below the surface, threatening to swallow up anyone who steps through them. The heat also hampered the rescue efforts, compounded by a severe lack of drinking water and the growing threat of disease. Temperatures on the ground are hovering around 34-degrees Celsius (93-degrees Fahrenheit). Teams of workers combed through the city spraying for insecticide and disinfectants. With so many dead bodies still believed to be decomposing in the heat and mud, fears of epidemic were on the rise. State media reported that 7,000 tents were delivered to the city to help house the displaced. But a lack of flat and stable ground to pitch camps meant that most survivors faced the prospect of another day without shelter, while digging through debris in search of loved ones. China's rainy season started with a vengeance in early May and has brought the worst flooding in a decade. More rain is forecast in the next few days. Some of the rocks and debris from the mudslide landed in the middle of the Bailong River that snakes through the area. The river overflowed and inundated low-lying neighborhoods. The government has been using explosives to break up the river debris, in an attempt to gradually release the water safely. CNN's Emily Chang in Zhouqu, China, and Brian Walker in Atlanta contributed to this report.","The death toll stands at 702 .

"(CNN) -- Iran unveiled the first long-range military drone manufactured in the country on Sunday, state media reported. The unmanned aerial vehicle is capable of carrying out bombing missions against ground targets and flying long distances at a high speed, Press TV said. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad attended the unveiling of the drone, dubbed the ""Karrar,"" in a ceremony marking Iran's Defense Industry Day. In February, Iran inaugurated the production line for two types of drones with bombing and reconnaissance capabilities, the semiofficial Fars news agency reported. Iran has manufactured its own tanks, armored personnel carriers, missiles and fighter planes since 1992, according to Press TV. The country successfully tested a radar-evading drone with bombing capabilities in June 2009, Press TV said. In March 2009, U.S. military officials said U.S. fighter jets in Iraq shot down an unmanned Iranian spy drone aircraft. At the time, most major state-run media outlets in Iran did not carry news of any incident involving an Iranian drone and Iraq's national security adviser declined to comment. Unmanned vehicles have become a staple of modern combat. U.S. military officials have said remotely-controlled drones minimize risk and allow troops to spy on and attack enemy combatants. Ahead of the drone's unveiling, Iran's defense minister said the country's military planned to reveal a project of ""great importance"" on Sunday, according to state-run Press TV. ""Iran's defense capability has reached a point which does not need any aid from other countries,"" Defense Minister Brig. Gen. Ahmad Vahidi said, according to the semiofficial Iranian Students News Agency. It is not clear whether the unveiling of the long-range drone was the announcement he was referring to. Vahidi's announcement Saturday came as Iran began fueling its first nuclear energy plant in the southern city of Bushehr, the nation's state media reported. Press TV said the effort will help the country create nuclear-generated electricity. But some Western nations have questioned whether the nuclear fuel will be used solely for electricity, suggesting that Iran would eventually try to enrich uranium on its own, providing material for nuclear weapons. The United States has questioned Iran's motives in continuing to enrich uranium within its borders. ""Russia is providing the fuel, and taking the fuel back out,"" White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said earlier this month. ""It, quite clearly, I think, underscores that Iran does not need its own enrichment capability if its intentions, as it states, are for a peaceful nuclear program,"" he said. Iran has maintained all along that the site will produce energy, but the United States and some other international observers remain unconvinced. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, speaking to Russian reporters in the Black Sea resort of Sochi on Wednesday, brushed off Western concerns about the Bushehr facility, calling it ""the most important anchor holding Iran to the nonproliferation regime,"" according to the Russian news agency RIA-Novosti.","State media: The unmanned aircraft can carry out bombing missions .

"(CNN) -- At least two carriages of a passenger train fell into a river Thursday after floods destroyed a bridge in southwest China's Sichuan Province, state-run CCTV reported Friday, citing Chengdu Railway authorities. It was not immediately known how many passengers were inside the carriages, which a firefighter said were swept 200 meters downriver. Local authorities said they were doing their best to carry out rescues. The accident occurred in Guanghan at about 3:20 p.m. Thursday on the Shi-ting-jiang Bridge, part of the railway line that links Chengdu and Baoji, in northwestern Shaanxi Province. Floods caused the bridge piers to collapse, which forced the train from its track, they said. People aboard five other carriages were taken to safety. The train was traveling from Xi'an, the capital of Shaanxi, to Kunming, the capital of southwestern Yunnan Province.","The fate of passengers and crew is not clear .

"(CNN) -- It was the kind of experience I couldn't make up. A few weeks ago, my husband and I were invited to a large dinner party. After we arrived, we were seated at a round table with four other couples. Introductions were made, and glasses of wine were poured. Kids and sports were discussed. Then, out of the blue, one of the men at the table made an announcement. ""Tom's wife writes Amish romances,"" he said while smiling, almost as if I should be embarrassed that he divulged my secret. My husband squeezed my hand, told how I write inspirational romances and said he was proud of me. The conversation moved on. I picked up my fork, ready to dig into my salad and listen to everyone else talk. Really, that's what I do best. But then I realized everyone was staring at me. ""You write religious books?"" one of the women asked. ""About people in buggies?"" I nodded. And then came the million-dollar question: ""Why?"" Of all the answers brewing inside of me, only one came to mind; the one answer that still feels the best: It gives me joy and enriches my readers' lives. Well, that's it in a nutshell, as one of my characters would say. I feel lucky to spend much of my days writing about people loving the Lord and falling in love at the same time. I don't feel those two things are mutually exclusive. Being a Christian is part of who I am, just like me being left-handed. It would be impossible to park my faith on the sidelines, pulling it out only on Sundays when it's time for church. I don't think I'm alone in this. Several articles have appeared lately in the media about the popularity of inspirational romances. The Wall Street Journal, Business Week and USA Today have noticed the popularity of inspirational fiction -- ""bonnet romances"" in particular. It's become one of the most profitable industries in publishing. Since I'm a working writer, I'm glad of that. But in my heart, I also see the need for this genre. In today's society, it's hard not to be blindsided by swearing, violence or suggestive language. Things that used to be thought of as unmentionable are now on television and in movies, and of course, in books. There's a large market for entertainment that pushes the envelope. I certainly don't shield myself against all of this. But sometimes, it's nice to know that there's a haven for people who don't necessarily want to spend their time around those elements. And that's where the inspirational market comes in. My readers know if they pick up one of my novels, they won't be shocked by anything in its pages. Furthermore, I work very hard to ensure that my characters will be spiritually challenged and lifted. I want my readers to believe in love and romance and maybe even God's grace by the time they read the last page. I enjoy Amish inspirational novels because they depict a lifestyle that is vastly different from mine. Like a lot of other women my age, I'm busy working, running to my children's sporting events and doing a hundred other activities that seem to take up too much time and leave me exhausted. However, in my Amish-themed novels, the pace is slower. Driving to town in a buggy means there's time to look at the flowers on the side of the road, or to actually talk to the person you're sitting next to. There's a quiet appeal to a way of life that doesn't involve computers, cell phones, traffic, radios or GPS systems. In the Amish community, family and faith are integral to every decision -- and with that comes comfort. When I write about my characters spending the morning in prayer, passing an afternoon canning with friends or piecing a quilt for a charity auction, I wish I were doing those things, too. And when my characters speak with absolute certainty that the Lord is with them, I also yearn to feel that way. I feel fortunate to be able to spend my days writing inspirational fiction, and even talking about it to people at a dinner party. And though people were still smirking at me at the end of the dinner, I'm hopeful that maybe one or two of them will pick up an inspirational novel from the shelves and give it a try. They might be pleasantly surprised.","Shelley Shepard Gray writes Amish romances, also known as bonnet romances .

"(CNN) -- Remote and wild, the windswept island of Newfoundland off Canada's Atlantic Coast offers Viking history, stunning rocky landscapes and warm, welcoming locals. iReporter Margaret Zubert, from Sudbury in the Canadian province of Ontario, recently traveled to Newfoundland as part of a travel quest. ""My goal is to visit all the Canadian provinces on the premise that even though I love to travel to other countries, I should also know my own country too. So, after the Newfoundland trip, I only have one more province to go!"" she said. The large island, which is part of Canada's easternmost province, Newfoundland and Labrador, even has its own time zone -- a half-hour ahead of neighbors to the west. Zubert, 63, made the trip to Newfoundland with her sister-in-law, Sylvia. They two took a 12-day bus tour from Deer Lake in the northwest, along the Northern Peninsula and then south along the east coast to St. John's. The tour was operated by McCarthy's Party, a local company. ""Our tour escort was a retired school principal who was just a fountain of information about the history, the people and the culture of the province,"" Zubert said. Zubert answered the following questions about her trip: . Favorite spots . That is a tough one to answer since we visited so many wonderful places. I'll give two places: St. John's, the capital city, because it's so different from most North American cities, and Conche, a small fishing village on the Northern Peninsula, which has the most fabulous tapestry I've seen outside of Europe. Don't-miss experience . Don't miss the chance to hear the locals perform! At almost every stop, local fiddlers and singers performed their own music. At times, it was toe-tapping dances or sea shanties; at other times, sad ballads that brought a tear to the eye. Share your travel experiences on iReport.com: Just back from . First impression . I was amazed by how rugged the landscape was and how close the sea was to every community. It's obvious that this harsh environment has helped to shape a tough and resilient people. Lasting memory . I will always remember the friendliness of the people. They were courteous yet funny, helpful but proud. Three adjectives that capture this place . Scenic, rugged, resilient . Biggest surprise . The amazing history -- from Vikings, to explorers, to current-day oil rigs off the coast. Most delicious food, drink or place to eat . Maybe not most delicious, but most notable is the local rum, Screech. If you go to Newfoundland, you have to be Screeched in! Most meals featured fish, and the featured fish there is cod.  We had wonderful fish chowders and fish cakes. Atlantic salmon was also very good. Check out Zubert's photos above for more on the places she visited. Have you been on a trip recently?

"(CNN) -- Defending champion Roger Federer will seek to claim his fourth Cincinnati Masters title on Sunday when he faces Mardy Fish. The third seed Federer leads Fish 5-1 in career meetings, but Fish beat Federer in their last meeting in 2008 at Indian Wells, according to ATP World Tour's Web site. In Saturday's semifinal, Fish beat fellow American ninth seed Andy Roddick 4-6, 7-6(3), 6-1 after rallying from a set down and near-defeat in the second set, according to ATP World Tour. Two rain delays went in favor of Fish, the first coming when Roddick led 5-4 in the first set, giving each players an hour respite. The second delay came during the second set when Fish was facing near-defeat at 2-5. Fish would return and force a tie-breaker, which he'd win, followed by a dominant deciding set. ""I've never felt better on the court, and I've never been more confident and I've never played better,"" Fish said, according to ATP World Tour's Web site. ""I've won a lot of matches this summer. [The weight loss] has a ton to do with it,"" he added, referring to some 30 pounds (13.6 kilos) he has shed. Of the weather, Roddick said, according to ATP World Tour, ""That's the thing with rain delays. The momentum can shift really fast."" Federer, playing against Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis in the other Saturday semifinal, won handedly 6-4, 6-3. The five-time ATP World Tour No. 1 from Switzerland dropped only three points on first serve and attributed a more aggressive game, including rushes to the net, to his downtime since Wimbledon. ""After Wimbledon I had six weeks to work on a few things. On the hard courts it's nice to play forwards and not always be defensive and let the other guy dictate,"" ATP World Tour quoted Federer as saying. ""I'm happy that the hard work is paying off right away."" Baghdatis, now ranked 20th, on Friday upset world No. 1 Rafael Nadal for the first time in his career following six defeats to the Spaniard. Federer is seeking only his second title this year following January's Australian Open success.","Fish beats fellow American Andy Roddick 4-6, 7-6(3), 6-1 .

"(CNN) -- Kim Clijsters will play Maria Sharapova in the final of the WTA tournament in Cincinnati after both had contrasting semifinal victories.

Belgian ace Clijsters is 4-3 ahead in career meetings with Sharapova and both will be bidding for a season-leading third title of the season on Sunday. Ivanovic will be hoping that the injury does not ruin her chances of continuing her improvement at next month's U.S. Open in New York, the final grand slam event of the tennis year. ""I was very scared. All of a sudden on that one shot, I felt something crack a little bit,"" she told reporters. ""Just on that one forehand when I went to step around it, I just felt like pain all of a sudden, so much pain in my foot and I couldn't step on it anymore. ""I tried a bit of tape, but I could not put any weight on it and there was no point in me continuing.""

"(CNN) -- The divorce of golfer Tiger Woods and wife Elin Nordegren was finalized Monday, according to a joint statement issued by their attorneys. The marriage's end comes nine months after allegations surfaced that Woods carried on several extramarital affairs. ""We are sad that our marriage is over and we wish each other the very best for the future,"" the statement said. ""While we are no longer married, we are the parents of two wonderful children and their happiness has been, and will always be, of paramount importance to both of us."" The judgment, issued Monday in Bay County, Florida, Circuit Court, allows for ""shared parenting of their two children,"" their attorneys said in a statement. The estranged couple asked for privacy as they ""adjust to a new family situation."" In the dissolution of marriage petition filed Monday, Nordegren cites the marriage as ""irretrievably broken"" as the reason for divorce. According to the document, the couple reached a settlement agreement July 3 in which they agreed to a joint parenting plan. Both Woods and Nordegren agreed to waive the 20-day delay period offered in Florida before a final judgment. ""The parties have been separated for a substantial period of time ... and the delay would generate unnecessary public attention,"" according to the waivers. The couple were married October 5, 2004. Allegations of infidelity first began to surface in November when Woods crashed his Cadillac Escalade into a fire hydrant and tree outside his family's home in Orlando. The November 27 incident, which left him with a sore neck and a cut on his lip that required five stitches to close, also set in motion the crash of his storybook life. A few days beforehand, the National Enquirer had reported he was having an affair with a New York nightclub hostess, who denied it. But that allegation was followed by others, and Woods' tightly controlled world and image soon began to crumble. Just after Christmas he entered a rehabilitation center, where he stayed for 45 days getting treatment for undisclosed ""issues."" ""It was to take a hard look at myself, and I did, and I've come out better,"" he said in April when he made his return to the PGA tour. Woods also has acknowledged that he engaged in multiple extramarital affairs over the course of his nearly six-year marriage.","The couple reached a settlement July 3, document says .
