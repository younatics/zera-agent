"(CNN)Even the grungiest rock stars have owned credit cards. Now, fans of Nirvana have the chance to have the gold-colored Visa that belonged to deceased front man Kurt Cobain. The Seafirst BankCard Visa has Cobain's signature on the back in blue. There's also what appears to be a phone number scribbled next his signature. The expiration date reads February 1995. Nearly a year before, on April 5, 1994, the musician shot himself in the head at his Seattle home. Paddle8, a marketplace for collectors of art and memorabilia, estimates that the card is worth around $7,000 to $9,000, according to its website. With five days left before the auction ends, the card is currently drawing bids of more than $12,000. The online platform, which claims the credit card is in excellent condition, is offering the item as part of its ""Legendary: Memorabilia From Rock Gods and Pop Stars"" collection. The credit card is one of the top valued items on the auction house's site, which is offering pop culture-inspired memorabilia, including Frank Sinatra's driver's license from 1944, and a handwritten U2 setlist from their tour supporting the band's 1983 album ""War.""","Kurt Cobain's Visa is auctioning off for more than $12,000 .

"Atlanta (CNN)Almost three weeks after she was found unresponsive in a bathtub, Bobbi Kristina Brown is still fighting for her life. Doctors have removed her breathing tube, two sources close to the family told CNN on Thursday, one day after the procedure supposedly took place. Brown, daughter of late singing star Whitney Houston, will now be ventilated through a hole in her throat. ""This is an indication that the patient will need this for weeks and months to come, as opposed to hours and days,"" said CNN's chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. He said the move lowers the risk of infection and is standard procedure. Brown, 21, remains in a medically induced coma at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. Doctors are attempting to slowly lift her coma, according to sources close to the family. The extent of her injuries is not known. Police have said they're treating Brown's case as a criminal investigation. She was found  in a bathtub full of water on January 31 at her Roswell, Georgia, residence. Her mother, who died in 2012, was similarly found in a bathtub, just hours before she was to attend a pre-Grammy Awards party.  A coroner ruled Houston's death an accidental drowning, with heart disease and cocaine use listed as contributing factors. Brown is her only child. CNN's MaryLynn Ryan, Sunny Hostin and Carolyn Sung contributed to this report.","Brown, daughter of late singing star Whitney Houston, will now be ventilated through a hole in her throat .

"(CNN)Video footage of Chelsea soccer fans apparently pushing a black man off a train in Paris on Tuesday have startled news followers around the world. It isn't hard to see why. Not only do the menacing fans, who were in the French capital to watch their team play Paris Saint-Germain, gruffly prevent the man from boarding the Metro; they then start to chant: ""We're racist, we're racist, and that's the way we like it!"" To behave in a racist fashion is bad enough; to boast of being racist takes things to a whole other level of wrongness. So it's not surprising that everyone from the French press to FIFA -- the Federation Internationale de Football Association -- has condemned the men's behavior, and that the video of the alarming episode is trending on Twitter, accompanied by outraged hashtags. Yet while it is right to find the conduct of these fans nauseating, it is wrong to hold this incident up as Exhibit A in a show trial of British soccer more broadly. Sadly, that is what is happening. Many observers are using this incident as hard evidence that British soccer remains an unreconstructed backwater, a sport stuck in a past, malign time, followed by prejudiced people. But actually, soccer isn't like that anymore. A columnist for the Daily Mail described the Chelsea men as a ""mob of filthy fans"" whose behavior was a ""throwback to the Eighties terrace culture"" -- that era when hooliganism was a genuine problem at English soccer games and racist attitudes were fairly widespread. He slams us all for ""foolishly believ(ing) this shameful behaviour was a thing of the past."" The fans' shoving and chanting spoke to the ""lingering nastiness"" in the so-called Beautiful Game, said one Guardian writer. Another suggested soccer is inherently racist, because it is ""all about feeling that you're part of one group and are opposed to another group ... the mentality of the racist."" So should we assume that soccer fans are more likely than others to harbor hateful thoughts for the Other? These shrill responses to one ugly incident do a grave disservice to both soccer and the millions of good people -- men, women and children of all races -- who follow it. The truth is that racism and violence at British soccer games, which were big problems in the past, have thankfully become rarer and rarer. According to figures from the UK Home Office, the number of arrests for ""racist or indecent chanting"" at soccer matches has declined steadily over the past 15 years -- from 82 in the 2000/01 soccer season to 21 in 2013/14. (And not all these chants will have been racist; the Home Office doesn't distinguish between chants that are racist and chants that are foul in other ways, for example, containing sexually explicit words.) The specter of the rough English hooligan is also disappearing. Home Office figures show that arrests in general at soccer, for all crimes, have declined over 15 years, from more than 4,000 in 2000/01 to 2,273 in 2013/14. And bear in mind that last year there were 30 million attendances at soccer matches. That means a measly 0.0075% of fans got into trouble with police, which is statistically insignificant. Today, more than 30% of soccer players in Britain are black. This represents a huge increase in the space of a decade: In 2004 the Commission for Racial Equality found that 12.2% of players were black. Can the media outlets deriding soccer for its alleged built-in racism show that 30% of their employees are black? As the number of black players increased, so the disgusting behavior of some fans of the past has declined. To be sure, some fans have behaved in a shockingly racist way over the decades. In the 1960s, when black players were a rarer sight, two black players for West Ham United, Clyde Best and Ade Coker, were the victims of monkey chants and banana throwing. As late as the 1980s, bananas were thrown at black players: In one infamous photo from 1987, black Liverpool player John Barnes could be seen kicking off the field a banana that had been hurled at him. Yet it is rare indeed to read newspaper reports of such behavior today. We should not condemn an entire sport and its millions of followers on the basis of what a tiny number of men did and said on a train in Paris. In fact, to do so is to promote another kind of prejudice, a view of the largely white working-class fans of soccer as uncouth, stupid, unenlightened. One commentary piece used the word Neanderthal to describe fans. That's the great irony of much of the outrage over the Chelsea fans' terrible behavior: In seeking to expose the alleged prejudices of the soccer family, many observers end up exposing their own.","Brendan O'Neill: Video of fans pushing black man, shouting racist chants plays to stereotype .

"(CNN)Barcelona's chances of winning the Spanish league where dealt a huge blow Saturday as they were beaten 1-0 by Malaga at the Camp Nou Stadium. A mistake by Barcelona defender Dani Alves in the eighth minute allowed Juanmi to fire Malaga in to the lead, a lead they maintained relatively comfortably. The defeat left them in second place just a point behind behind Real but with their Madrid rivals still to play its one game in hand. Much of the talk before this weekend's round of fixtures surrounded the effectiveness of MSN versus BBC;  acronyms for the players that have been pivotal in attack for Barcelona and Real Madrid this season. Messi, Suarez and Neymar for the former; Benzema, Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo for the latter. Up until the start of the year, Real Madrid's strike force had dominated. But since the start of 2015 Barcelona's new look triumvirate has thrived. Lionel Messi has scored 14 goals alone, two more than the entire Real strike force, whilst Neymar has bagged ten goals, and Suarez four. But the three players were surprisingly subdued and had no answer to Malaga's resolute defending. ""We're used to these kind of games. I'd like it to be an accident but it is becoming habit, the opposition close up and we can't find a way through,"" Barcelona boss Luis Enrique told AFP after the game. ""These kind of results are sometimes a good reminder that other sides have their qualities. You could consider this a deserved defeat."" The result ended a superb run of form for Barcelona, who had won their last 11 matches in all competitions and scored 42 goals in the process. ""They scored and shut up shop,""  added a frustrated Sergio Busquets. ""They let us use the ball out wide and we tried, but the final ball wasn't there and we didn't create clear cut chances.""

"(CNN)World champion Lewis Hamilton emerged from his sick bed for a marathon stint in his Mercedes but it was Red Bull rival Daniel Ricciardo who set the fastest time on the second day of F1 pre-season testing in Barcelona Friday. Hamilton had to cut short his session on the first day as he complained of a fever and his reappearance for the afternoon runs at the Circuit de Catalunya came as something of a surprise to the fans and media following proceedings. He duly completed 89 laps and ominously for Mercedes' rivals for the upcoming season set the fifth fastest time, despite running on slower medium compound tires. The 30-year-old Briton was just over a third of a second slower than the one minute 24.574 seconds posted by Ricciardo, who set the time on a soft tire, generally reckoned to be about one second faster per lap than the medium. Hamilton's teammate Nico Rosberg had taken the wheel for the morning session and completed 66 laps -- eventually finishing sixth on the time sheets, with his best lap also set on the medium tire. Rosberg, troubled by a neck injury Thursday, had double reason to celebrate his promising showing as he announced on social media that his wife Vivian was expecting their first child. While Mercedes appears set to continue its 2014 dominance into the new season, it was undoubtedly an improvement for Ricciardo and Red Bull, as the Australian attempted to simulate race conditions and totaled 143 laps over the two sessions, the most by a single driver on the second day. Ferrari -- so off the pace in Fernando Alonso's final season with the famous marquee in 2014 -- has also found encouragement from the two pre-season tests to date and Kimi Raikkonen was second fastest behind Ricciardo. Third best was the Williams of Felipe Massa, with less than a tenth of a second separating the top three.  Sergio Perez was fourth fastest in the year-old Force India VJM07. With the first race of the season less than a month away from March 13-15 in Australia, time is running out for team's struggling with their 2015 cars, not least CNN-sponsored McLaren-Honda, with former world champions  Alonso and Jenson Button in its driver lineup. Alonso, who has switched from Ferrari, was finally able to get some meaningful action under his belt with a total of 59 laps and the seventh fastest time. McLaren's MP4-30 is using cutting edge technology combined with a new Honda engine, but there have been extensive teething problems. Two sons of illustrious motorsport fathers were also in action Friday.  Jolyon Palmer, whose father Jonathan raced in F1, was eighth best for Lotus in his first test at this level. Carlos Sainz Jr, the offspring of the former world rally champion, drove for Toro Rosso and racked up 100 laps although triggering a red flag when he went off and into the gravel on Turn 9 at the Spanish circuit. Testing continues for the next two days at the same venue and the teams return from next Thursday for a final four days to iron out problems before the season starts for real.","Daniel Ricciardo sets fastest time in second day of testing at Circuit de Catalunya .

"(CNN)Two UK Royal Air Force jets intercepted a pair of Russian aircraft flying near British airspace this week, the British Defence Ministry said Thursday, marking the latest in what NATO has said is an increase in Russian military flights near alliance members' territory. The British Typhoon jets intercepted the Russian aircraft Wednesday over international waters near Cornwall, in southwestern England, a ministry representative said Thursday. ""The Russian planes were escorted by the RAF until they were out of the UK area of interest. At no time did the Russian military aircraft cross into UK sovereign airspace,"" the representative said. The Defence Ministry didn't specify what type of aircraft the Russians were flying. In November, NATO said its members' jets had been scrambled more than 400 times in 2014 to intercept Russian military flights close to members' territories -- a 50% increase over the previous year. The increase harkens back to the days of the Cold War, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said November 20 during a visit to NATO member Estonia. In a November report, the European Leadership Network listed more than 40 ""close military encounters between Russia and the West"" in the eight months from March to October. Three of those -- including a near collision between a Russian military plane and a Swedish passenger aircraft carrying 132 people -- were classified as ""high-risk"" incidents that could have led to direct military confrontation between Russia and the West, according to the report, titled ""Dangerous Brinksmanship."" UK jets intercepted more than 100 Russian aircraft last year, according to the British Defence Ministry.","UK: Russian military planes were flying in international waters near Cornwall .

"(CNN)She scored the second best goal of 2014 and now Irish forward Stephanie Roche has landed herself a move to U.S. National Women's Soccer League side, Houston Dash. Roche's volley for Peamount United against Wexford Youths in a Irish league game watched by fewer than 100 spectators became the first goal scored by a woman to be named a finalist in the FIFA Puskas Award for goal of the year. ""I am so excited about the signing of Stephanie, we are getting a player that has great technical ability, a superb left foot, and possibly the best goalscorer to come out of Ireland since (former international striker) Olivia O'Toole,"" Dash head coach Randy Waldrum said on the club's website. ""Stephanie will bring a wealth of international experience to our team, and another great attacking option that is different from what we have already,"" he added. ""All our Dash fans and fans of women's soccer in general will be excited about this signing."" James Rodriguez won the Puskas Award for 2014, but the Colombian was gracious enough to say that Roche's fabulous volley, which took second place at FIFA's glitzy ceremony in January, just might have trumped his goal against Uruguay at the World Cup last year saying it ""deserved to win, but only one can."" Rodriguez's goal came in front of thousands at Rio's Maracana Stadium, with millions more around the world watching on TV. It was a very different setting when Roche collected the ball with her back to goal, flicked it over her head and crashed it home while playing in the Irish Woman's National League. Nevertheless, her brilliant goal, filmed by chance, beat Robin van Persie's flying header for Holland against Spain at the World Cup into third place. Victorious Real Madrid forward Rodriguez hailed Roche's effort as ""a golazo""  (an amazing goal), while Italy legend Alessandro del Piero described her as the ""moral winner."" ""She is great,"" Del Piero added. ""She needs to score another one for next year. That is what I would say to her."" The FIFA award, voted for by the public, saw Roche take 33% of the vote, with winner Rodriguez on 42% and Van Persie some way back on 11%. Roche first represented the Republic of Ireland when she was 14 years old playing for the Under-17 team, and has since earned 35 senior caps for her country. The 25-year-old's move to America follows a brief stint with French club ASPTT Albi where she struggled with the language barrier according to the Irish Times. Roche's boyfriend Dean Zambra, who plays for League of Ireland side, Bray Wanderers, will join her in the U.S. for three months to help the striker settle in. ""I've been given a huge opportunity by Houston Dash and I'm hoping I'll be able to go over and do well and hopefully be successful over there"" Roche told RTE Radio. No terms of the deal have been revealed.","Stephanie Roche is off to America to play for Houston Dash in the U.S. Woman's National Football League .

"For Urban Treuil, there's no escaping the misery. Because of Hurricane Isaac, Treuil's home in Braithwaite, Louisiana, is ruined by floodwaters. So, too, is the gas station and convenience store he owned and ran in the community, 15 miles by car and 10 miles as the crow flies from New Orleans. But all that pales to what Treuil, the fire chief for Braithwaite and Woodlawn in Plaquemines Parish, saw when he and fellow volunteer firefighters steered their boat up to the home of a couple he knew. Inside, they found the pair floating in the kitchen, the first of at least three fatalities in Louisiana being blamed on Isaac. ""It's not something I want to see, and I hope it's the last ones we do see,"" said an exhausted Treuil on Friday, a day after he pulled the couple from the home. In terms of total deaths, Isaac doesn't compare to Hurricane Katrina, which led to nearly 1,800 fatalities in New Orleans and the vicinity seven years ago. Isaac struck Louisiana on Tuesday night as a Category 1 hurricane, not a Category 3 like Katrina. Don't tell that, though, to the thousands of residents in St. Tammany, Ascension, Plaquemines and other parishes who Friday found their homes and hometowns still deluged. Even with a few drops of drizzle falling all day and with levels down considerably from the previous day, waters were still 10 feet deep in spots. ""This is unbelievable. Deja vu, man,"" Billy Nungesser, president of Plaquemines Parish said Thursday as he surveyed the town of Ironton, inundated by floodwater and sludge. ""There is more water here than Katrina."" It was a sentiment echoed by an assistant fire chief in the parish, while on a boat moving through an area in which floodwaters almost universally covered the first floor of 200 homes. Red carpet still out for New Orleans tourists . Most people had heeded a mandatory evacuation order issue Monday, but not all. Video footage from CNN affiliate New Orleans WWL showed rescuers pulling out an ax and hacking an attic vent. Soon after, 70-year-old Fred Leslie climbed out and slid down his roof. Rescuers also managed to get out his four dogs, one of whom fell into the water and another who jumped into a reporter's arms. Dressed in a T-shirt and shorts, Leslie said that he had evacuated ahead of Katrina. He told WWL that he'd stayed this time because ""I didn't think it would happen again."" But within just five minutes, Leslie said his home was ""six feet deep"" with water. He then grabbed whatever he could, got the dogs, and rushed to the attic. There will be no rebuilding here this time, as Leslie did after Katrina. ""It's just one of those things,"" he said, still drenched, of the storm. ""I'm going to find someplace else. I'm getting too old for this."" About 35 miles northeast in Slidell, along the shores of Lake Pontchartrain, CNN iReporter Vincent Molino said that he came across at least 10 vehicles flooded and ""unsalvageable"" while surveying the city Friday. Water had also gotten into several homes, especially those without crawl spaces or, like Molino's, not built up on stilts. Ironically, some of the luckiest residents were those who'd had their homes destroyed by or after Katrina -- because their rebuilt homes were elevated or otherwise protected, per new requirements to qualify for insurance. Businesses along one strip in Slidell, a community of about 27,000 people, were soaked in an inch or more of water, even though they are about five miles from the lakefront. ""There are so many ups and downs,"" Molino said of the floodwaters. ""It seeps in all these weird ways."" At the same time, Molino said that many people he'd talked to were both philosophical and confused about what Mother Nature had wrought this time -- ""happy"" that they weren't hit harder but still ""shocked that this, basically, tropical storm could have made such a strong surge."" Inside New Orleans, anyone who lived through Katrina knew it could have been worse. That didn't change the fact Friday was not a fun day -- ""hot, muggy, sticky, nasty,"" especially for the many without electricity, according to Eileen Romero, another iReporter. Some kept their refrigerators and such running with generators, which in Romero's case required five 5-gallon gas containers to operate every 24 hours. A shortage of gas made keeping generators humming and cars moving difficult, and lines were long at the grocery and other stores that did open for business. Yet they were bright spots under the still gloomy skies, Romero said. Such the electrician from down the street who came over to fix her generator, she recalled. Or those who cleared limbs and branches from their neighbors' sidewalks, piling them up with no questions asked. New Orleans, and all of southeastern Louisiana, has been here before -- not just being socked by a hurricane, but rallying around each other afterward. And they're doing it again, said Romero. ""It's just people helping people,"" she said. ""It's amazing to me, it's nice to me. It's a beautiful kind of thing.""","Isaac hit Louisiana as a hurricane and lingered, causing massive flooding .

"Atlanta (CNN)The day before Susan Bennett came out as the original voice of Siri in the United States, she lost her iPhone. Siriously. But that's just one smile-inducing twist in a less-than-two-week journey that's left this suburban Atlanta voiceover actor ""gobsmacked"" and feeling like ""some strange tropical bird"" on display, she said. ""I had no idea this would be such a big deal."" On October 4, exactly two years after Apple's virtual ""assistant"" was introduced to the masses with the release of the iPhone 4S, CNN revealed her identity. Hours after our in-depth story was published online, she was sitting on the New York set of CNN's ""New Day"" morning show. And a new day it was for Bennett, who -- without her phone -- had no idea how much her world was about to change. At her airport gate to head home from New York, she got a sense. A man who kept staring at her finally approached with a question: ""Are you that Siri person?"" Coming forward, in itself, had been cathartic. She'd grappled with the idea, mostly at the urging of her son, ever since she was surprised to find out she was the voice behind Siri. The recordings used for the Siri voice had been laid down by Bennett in 2005, long before anyone outside of Apple knew that something called an iPhone was even on the horizon. ""I can't tell you how freeing it was to make that decision,"" she said. ""I'd been torturing myself for two years."" After a whirlwind 10 days of travel and newfound exposure, Bennett sat down over coffee and talked about what her life has been like since she took the leap from anonymity. The media frenzy . To say that she got slammed with media requests would be an understatement. By the time Bennett got back to Atlanta from her morning TV appearance on CNN's ""New Day,"" between 400 and 500 e-mails were waiting for her. Most of them were requests for interviews. Meanwhile, her husband, Rick Hinkle, sat at home fielding phone calls as they poured in and asking, through the front door, for a local TV crew to leave. ""I thought I might get a couple e-mails. Maybe the (The Atlanta Journal-Constitution) would want to do a little story,"" Bennett said. ""This is craziness."" 15 of Siri's best (and worst) jokes . The requests have been global, coming from places as far-flung as the United Arab Emirates, New Zealand, Ireland and Israel. She stared at what was in front of her, knowing she was in over her head. She had no idea where to begin. Fortunately, a hot-shot publicist in Los Angeles, Monique Moss of Integrated PR, was prepared to take over. Bennett would quickly go on to read a Top 10 list for David Letterman and make appearances on ""The Queen Latifah Show"" and HLN's ""Showbiz Tonight."" She's done interviews with a handful of media outlets, including USA Today and the Los Angeles Times, and hit the radio morning show circuit: 18 programs in three hours alone. A new stable of handlers . The publicist is just one person helping Bennett navigate her new normal. She's also landed Wes Stevens of VOX Inc., one of the top voiceover agents in the nation and someone she hopes will help her reach her ultimate dream: to voice a cartoon character. Bennett doesn't want to discuss details but said after last week, that dream finally feels possible. And then there's her son, Cameron Bennett, a photographer in Los Angeles. On a four-day trip Bennett recently took to L.A., her son played chauffeur, schlepping his sleep-deprived mother from meeting to meeting. He also has stepped in to manage his mom's growing social media presence, something she'd never focused on before. And that's how her new Twitter handle, @SiriouslySusan, was born. Finding comfort in the spotlight . When asked to appear on CNN's ""New Day,"" Bennett was at first reticent. Years earlier, she'd done on-camera work, mostly for corporate videos. But in a world where appearance -- and, by association, age -- matters, she found herself being phased out. As a voiceover actor, she doesn't have to worry about looks and can wear what she wants. There's tremendous comfort in that. So the decision to step in front of live cameras wasn't immediate for her. But she then realized that coming out as the voice of Siri had been the big hurdle. That was the scary part. Once she did walk onto the set of ""New Day,"" she was surprised by how comfortable she was. ""All of a sudden, that old memory of how to behave on camera came out,"" said Bennett, who declines to give her age. ""I wasn't nervous at all."" The caked-on makeup, though, she can do without. By the time she got back from her L.A. jaunt, she said, her skin -- what with all the makeup, the drier air, the lack of sleep -- felt like it had aged 10 years. She got home and said all she wanted to do was face-plant into a tub of moisturizer. Well, that and sleep. Over four days in L.A., this night owl thinks she got no more than 18 hours of sleep. ""I felt really proud of myself that I was able to do everything I was asked to do,"" she said. ""It was exciting but also exhausting."" Unexpected -- and moving -- messages . In the past 10 days, Bennett has heard from old friends, people she hasn't been in touch with for decades. And while most close family members were privy to her Siri secret, some distant relatives were not, which has meant some reconnecting that way, too. Strangers have written, begging her to record their outgoing messages for them. And wannabe voiceover actors seeking advice have reached out to Bennett, who's trying to make a point to answer each and every e-mail -- which at last count numbered more than 600. But the most moving responses have come from members of the blind community. Bennett has long been a voice of many TTS, or text-to-speech, services, beyond the technology used to create Siri. For the first time, she's received thank-you notes from people she's served, people who've relied on her but didn't know her name until now. Their common message: ""Thanks for enabling us to do all we do,"" she said. One writer specified that she'd helped him work his computer, use his phone and ""read"" textbooks. Realizing the tangible difference her voice has made in other people's lives made her cry. ""This can be a thankless business,"" she said. ""It's so nice to know my voice is being used in a good way."" What's next . Bennett feels blessed to love what she does in Atlanta. She came home to her loving guitarist husband, her kitties, the lush trees and her quiet home. She's back with her community of colleagues, musicians and friends she couldn't appreciate more. Between resting her voice from all the recent attention, she's getting back to work -- serving the same clients, recording in her home booth, laughing with the engineers who feel like family. She doesn't expect this flood of attention to last forever. She suspects that most of her ""15 minutes of fame"" already came and went. If she continues doing what she does, she says, she'll be fine. But she's open and excited to see what might happen next. ""Life is change,"" she said. ""It's inevitable."" There's talk of a book deal and a speaking tour, two ideas that make her shake her head in amused disbelief. She's already been asked to give a keynote address at a big telecommunications conference next year. And if other new jobs come out of this experience -- like a cartoon offer, perhaps -- she would, of course, be thrilled. ""I'm grateful for all of it,"" she said. ""It's absolutely surreal."" But, Bennett insisted, none of this has changed or will change who she is. She looked down at her new iPhone 5S, the one she can't seem to figure out -- ""Why can't I get e-mail?"" -- and headed back to real life.","On October 4, CNN revealed Susan Bennett as the original U.S. voice of Siri on the iPhone .

"(CNN)The dissident Russian punk band Pussy Riot has dedicated its first English-language song, ""I Can't Breathe,"" to Eric Garner. ""This song is for Eric and for all those from Russia to America and around the globe who suffer from state terror -- killed, choked, perished because of war and state-sponsored violence of all kinds -- for political prisoners and those on the streets fighting for change,"" the band said Wednesday. ""We stand in solidarity."" Garner, an unarmed black man, died in New York in July after a white police officer put him in a chokehold. A grand jury in December decided not to indict the officer, Daniel Pantaleo. Garner's last words, ""I can't breathe,"" became a rallying cry for protests over police treatment of minorities in the United States and inspired Pussy Riot's latest song. The band recorded the track in New York in December, amid the protests following the grand jury decision not to indict Pantaleo. They released two different videos for the song Wednesday. One is a compilation of footage filmed at the site of Garner's death on Staten Island. It shows memorials and demonstrations after the grand jury decision and features members of Garner's family. ""It was a cold and militarized winter, a time of grief and outrage,"" the band said. The other video shows Pussy Riot's two highest-profile members, Maria Alyokhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, gradually being buried in a grave.

"(CNN)Three games without scoring constituted a slump for Cristiano Ronaldo. But the drought is now over for the three-time world player of the year. Ronaldo netted the opener and assisted on Marcelo's thunderbolt as Real Madrid moved closer to a place in the quarterfinals of the Champions League by defeating Schalke 2-0 in Germany on Wednesday. The result couldn't match Real's 6-1 thrashing of Schalke in the first leg in the same round last year but the home side still faces an uphill task of eliminating the defending champion. ""It was good,"" Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti told Sky Sports. ""I think we started well with a good rhythm in the game and a good attitude and then after the first goal the game was easier. ""We didn't need to push to score and we controlled the game well. At the end the victory was good for us."" Real Madrid -- bidding to become the first club to retain the title in the Champions League era -- won for a 10th straight time in the competition to equal Bayern Munich's record, although the early stages of the contest favored Schalke. Indeed in the battle of Italian coaches who have lifted the Champions League trophy, Roberto di Matteo and his team bettered Ancelotti's troops for the first 25 minutes. Schalke neutralized the attacking trio of Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema, with Iker Casillas forced to dive to keep out Klaas-Jan Huntelaar's long range effort. Real Madrid took the lead in the 26th minute when Ronaldo headed Daniel Carvajal's cross past an out of position Timon Wellenreuther -- and was never really troubled thereafter. Buoyed by his goal, Ronaldo attempted a bicycle kick moments later and then saw the inexperienced Wellenreuther soar to his right to repel his free kick. A vital interception from the 19-year-old Wellenreuther foiled Bale's bid to set up Ronaldo. ""It is clear that Cristiano Ronaldo lives to score goals,"" Ancelotti was quoted as saying by UEFA. ""It's never a problem for us when he doesn't score for a couple of games. But he, of course, minds."" Not one to sit back and protect a lead, Real Madrid continued to race forward in the second half. A poor touch from Ronaldo near the box prevented a chance but Isco should have done better when Bale's clever flick sent the Spanish international in all alone in the 72nd minute. Having barely tested Casillas, Schalke caught the Real Madrid defense napping in the 74th minute and almost equalized. A long ball over the top found its way to Atsuto Uchida, whose layoff fell perfectly to Felix Platte. Platte -- in for the injured Huntelaar -- struck the crossbar. Marcelo settled the affair -- and probably the tie -- when he sent a rocket into the top corner with his right foot, not his favored left, in the 79th minute. He exchanged a hug with a joyous Ancelotti. ""We are not used to seeing Marcelo score with the right foot, so for this I was really surprised,"" Ancelotti told Sky. Ancelotti then laughed when it was suggested to him that Real Madrid was under less pressure in the Champions League this season because it captured a 10th title -- or 'Decima' -- last year. ""The pressure is the same,"" he said. ""Last year we spoke of the 'Decima.' This year it's about (an 11th title) so the pressure is the same."" In Wednesday's other game, Basel and Porto played to a 1-1 draw in Switzerland. Basel scored with its lone shot on target in the 11th minute thanks to Derlis Gonzalez but Porto -- which had a goal disallowed for offside in the first half -- earned a valuable away goal through Danilo's penalty in the 79th.","Real Madrid defeats Schalke 2-0 in the Champions League .

"(CNN)She looks every inch a Bond girl, reclining in the Caribbean shallows, the breakwater washing over her bronzed body as she runs her fingers through her long, lustrous tawny locks. Slim, toned with rock-hard abs, she has a physique that 007 himself would probably kill for. ""It's important to accept your body for what God gave you,"" the star of the U.S. women's soccer team Alex Morgan tells CNN in a phone interview, as she talks about her career -- and the importance of being comfortable in your own skin, whatever shape you are. Football's answer to Ursula Andress, the 25-year-old Morgan has posed for Sports Illustrated's Swimsuit Edition. Twice. The publication's annual homage to scantily-clad women divides opinion, with critics arguing it serves only to objectify the female athletes who occasionally feature on its pages. Away from the camera lens, the pacey striker's achievements have propelled her to the summit of women's football. Morgan has half a century of goals for her country and already has an Olympic gold medal in her back pocket. Those years of grafting to build a career and sculpt a seemingly flawless form led to the Sports Illustrated photo shoots. ""I certainly don't feel like I have the perfect body type ... It's through your own eyes,"" says the California native. ""And for every female, you're going to see flaws in that, you're going to see flaws regardless. ""So for me it's just important to have that confidence and self-esteem no matter what body type you have. I guess that's why I did Sports Illustrated."" Not that Morgan is a natural exhibitionist. Her willingness to disrobe is born of a confidence cultivated by sporting excellence and she readily admits to having hang ups about her body just like any other woman -- ""no matter if I have bigger legs than upper body,"" as she puts it. ""The reason I'm given these opportunities is because of my talents on the field and I expect myself to continue to improve and show people exactly what I have to offer."" She's fully aware that her pictures might serve as titillation for an audience less concerned with her footballing prowess, but Morgan argues the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issues are a powerful platform to get U.S. women's football into the nation's mindset. ""I think there's a certain degree which guys like to buy the issue for themselves,"" admits Morgan. ""But, from my point of view, I'm doing this for myself. I'm doing this for the sport and for young girls to see the confidence that I am showing and that I am expressing."" Morgan is all too aware that, for women, objectification is an everyday occurrence. ""Being objectified, for a female, is going to happen no matter if you're posing for a magazine or walking down the street, that's just going to happen in every female's life,"" she argues. ""What I wanted to do was to express my confidence and be proud of the hard work I put in on the field to have the body that I have."" Engendering that confidence in younger women was also part of the motivation for ""The Kicks"" -- a series of books authored by Morgan about a young girl's experiences on a soccer team. Released in 2013, the first novel ""Saving the Team"" debuted at No. 7 on the New York Times Bestsellers List for Children's Middle Grade literature, while Amazon is said to have ordered a pilot for a small screen adaptation of the series. ""There's not a lot of young, female athlete books out there, aimed just towards girls,"" says Morgan,  who once described herself as ""never a great writer,"" before adding: ""For me, that's why it was so successful. ""The commitment I had for soccer was just ridiculous. A ridiculous passion that no one shared with me. It's really great to be able to talk to young girls now and have them feel so proud of what they're doing and so confident from a simple book like 'The Kicks.'"" However, Morgan's debut at the Women's World Cup four years ago didn't quite have the happy ending the forward was after. Japan were the U.S. team's opponents in a nail-biting final in Frankfurt, Germany. The match finished 2-2 after extra-time, with Morgan opening the scoring in the 69th minute, and went to a penalty shootout. It was Japan who earned an emotional victory, just four months after the country had been devastated by a tsunami that killed over 15,000 people. Ahead of this year's tournament in Canada, Morgan is confident the Americans can go one step further this time around. ""The last World Cup was my first and it was heart-breaking,"" she admits. ""Losing to Japan on penalties, feeling like we were deserving and they were just as deserving. ""We had two World Cup championship teams fighting for one spot and that was really hard. ""We feel really confident. We have the potential to be the best team in the world and we have great players."" Asked if the U.S. team will ultimately lift the trophy, Morgan's response is succinct. ""Let's talk in July."" It's often said that the harder you work the luckier you get, which brings us to the question of just why Morgan wears the No. 13 shirt for the USWNT? ""Me and my sister ... we never really understood the unluckiness of the number 13,"" laughs Morgan. ""We would go to hotels and we would go on vacations with our family and there was never a floor 13. We thought that was the strangest thing. ""We always told ourselves that when we got old and rich we would have a hotel called ""The Lucky 13"" and all of the floors would be 13a, 13b, 13c... It was something that we joked about, just the ridiculousness of people thinking a simple number was unlucky."" And serendipity came knocking when Morgan started her club career and it was the only number available to her. ""So I thought 'I'm going to take it!' I've never seen any unluckiness in this number and it's done great things for me.""

"Washington (CNN)He ousted Egypt's first democratically elected president in a coup, crushed political dissent, let foreign journalists languish in jail and just jabbed the U.S. by greeting Vladimir Putin as a hero. Yet Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi is fast becoming the favorite Middle East strongman of American conservatives and Republican presidential hopefuls. Jeb Bush says he can't understand why the White House has told Sisi ""you're not on our team"" as jihadism spreads like wildfire through the Middle East. Ted Cruz, another GOP 2016 pretender has also praised him, and key conservative media figures are lionizing Sisi. The rush of affection for the former Army Chief contrasts with the strained relationship between Sisi and the White House, reflected in the Obama administration's decision not to publicly back air strikes by Egypt on a common enemy -- ISIS -- in Libya this week. It's also the latest manifestation of the decades-long tussle between the U.S. and Egypt, which pits a push for human rights and democracy against the yearning for a stable pro-U.S. partner in a chaotic region, whatever the character of its regime. The spur for the conservative infatuation for Sisi was a speech in January in which the Egyptian leader warned Islam was being ""torn"" and ""destroyed"" by extremism. ""It's inconceivable that the thinking that we hold most sacred should cause the entire Islamic world to be a source of anxiety, danger, killing and destruction for the rest of the world,"" said Sisi. Sisi spoke in a highly symbolic venue, the Al Azhar Mosque in Cairo, one of the most vaulted seats of learning in the Muslim world. ""It's antagonizing the entire world! Does this mean that 1.6 billion people (Muslims) should want to kill the rest of the world's inhabitants -- that is 7 billion -- so that they themselves may live? Impossible!​"" On the face of it, Sisi's speech was a call to cleanse Islam of extremist thought and elements which groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda have used to justify jihad. It continues to impress conservatives in the United States amid a fierce political debate about how to contain ISIS's march across the region. ""He gave this incredible speech about Muslim extremism, and saying it's the responsibility of the Arab world to step up to fight this; that the first risks are for countries like Egypt,"" Bush said in Chicago on Wednesday. It's no coincidence that Republicans are praising the speech's blunt message at the same time as they are accusing President Barack Obama of falling prey to political correctness in his unwillingness to state the U.S. is at war with radical Islam. That comparison is also frequently being made on conservative talk radio. Cruz also praised Sisi on Fox News on Wednesday. ""What would be far better to see was the kind of courage that was demonstrated just a few weeks ago by President al-Sisi in Cairo,"" Cruz said. ""Why don't we see the president of the United States demonstrating that same courage, just to speak the truth, about the face of evil we are facing right now?"" Cruz asked. Mike Huckabee, another potential Republican presidential contender, said ""thank God for President al-Sisi in Egypt"" in an interview with NewsMax TV. Southern Baptist leader Richard Land wrote in The Christian Post that the Sisi speech could be as historically resonant as Martin Luther King's ""I have a Dream"" speech or president John Kennedy's declaration : ""Ich bin ein Berliner."" Conservative commentator George Will said on Fox News Sunday last month that Sisi may deserve the Nobel Peace Prize. But are U.S. political figures ripping a speech redolent with Egyptian political overtones out of context to back up their own positions? Professor Nathan Brown of George Washington University said that Sisi's remarks were not that unusual and that a number of Arab leaders have previously given similar speeches to limited effect. ""It is standard stuff,"" he said. And Sisi's record toward political opponents and extremists, especially the Muslim Brotherhood, which formed Egypt's first democratic government until it was ousted by his army amid mass protests in 2013, paints a different picture of the Egyptian leader. ""The way that Sisi represents dealing with them is not through abstract theological arguments but through a severe security and political response,"" said Brown, who is also with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""That is what he represents. That part of the message gets lost."" The State Department and rights groups fault Egypt for the removal of a civilian government, using lethal force to disburse MB protests, and for killing hundreds of protestors nationwide and say discrimination against Christians and Jews in Egypt remains widespread. Some analysts interpreted Sisi's speech as a way to justify the exclusion from politics of Islamist elements from political life in Egypt following his landslide win in an election last year in which the Brotherhood was banned. Since the election, the Obama administration has tried to carefully restore ties with Egypt on the grounds that it remains a vital strategic partner. Secretary of State John Kerry visited Cairo in September and Obama met Sisi on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York last year. Close intelligence cooperation continues behind the scenes. But relations have remained strained. After the coup the U.S. temporarily held up a tranch of $500 million in military aid to Egypt and an order of attack helicopters. Reconciliation has been made more difficult by the detention in Egypt of foreign journalists. The spectacle of Putin getting a warm welcome from Sisi in a visit last week did not go unnoticed in Washington, and was an apparent sign from the Cairo government that if the U.S. does not take better care of its friends, Egypt  will look elsewhere. The Pentagon, meanwhile, said it was not even told in advance about Egyptian air strikes this week on ISIS targets in Libya in revenge for the beheadings of 21 Egyptian Coptic Christian workers by an ISIS-affiliated group. ""It's a complex relationship that we have with Egypt,"" said Pentagon spokesman John Kirby. ISIS's swift spread in the Arab world has some realists in Washington considering whether it's time to re-emphasise the stability dimension of the U.S. relationship with Cairo. Bush suggested as much on Wednesday, in remarks that were especially noteworthy because the second term administration of his brother, George W. Bush, angered the government of then Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak by issuing a call for democracy in the Arab world as part of its Freedom Agenda. Jeb Bush asked Wednesday: ""Is (Sisi) a little ""L"" liberal democrat that believes in freedom like we do?"" ""No, he isn't. But I think we have to be practical,"" Bush said in the first foreign policy speech of his putative presidential campaign which could augur another turn in the roller coaster US-Egypt relationship. ""We have to balance our belief in liberty with a belief that security and engagement will create the possibilities for the Egyptians to garner more freedom.

"(CNN)He moves grown men to tears, entrances millions with his footwork and sparks delirious celebrations from adoring fans -- and now Lionel Messi has become a famous artist's latest muse. Japan's Takashi Murakami portrait of the Barcelona great sold for £317,000 ($488,000) at a charity auction in London Thursday. ""Lionel Messi and a Universe of Flowers"" depicts the Argentine surrounded by a psychedelic bouquet and forms a central part of an auction hosted by one of the world's largest brokers of fine art Sotheby's. The 1in11 charity -- launched by the Lionel Messi & FC Barcelona Foundation, UNICEF, and Reach Out To Asia that funds access to education and sports for children across the world, raised a total of $3.8 million. ""It was extraordinary. It's a spectacular number, and we are very happy,"" Ramon Pont, vice president of the FC Barcelona Foundation, said in a statement. ""Today, in addition to the artworks and the stars who have inspired them, the true protagonists are the children of Nepal, Indonesia, and Bangladesh, who will find it easier to go to school and fulfill their dreams."" British art enfant terrible Damien Hirst -- famous for pickling dead animals in formaldehyde -- also had a piece up for sale, capturing the beauty of Messi in a spin painting which sold for $562,000. The art of football . Many members of football's elite are collectors of art -- David Beckham, Thierry Henry, Roman Abramovich and Fabio Capello, to name a few -- and the ""beautiful game"" serves as inspiration to a host of artists across the globe. The artworks take wildly varying forms, from bright abstract compositions to painstaking tapestries. While Nicolas de Stael's ""Footballeurs,"" comprised of blobs of colors splashed liberally across the canvas, might look like it was done by somebody who got carried away with paint samples, it actually depicts one of the first ever football games to be played under floodlights in France 1952. De Stael was so inspired by what he saw that he immediately went home and stayed up the whole night to create this masterpiece worth millions, attracting interest in a separate Sotheby's auction. Francesco Vezzoli's ancient Greek themed ""Portrait of Gerard Pique as Apollo del Belvedere"" goes as far as to liken Messi's Barca teammate to a god. ""These people are divas -- but not in a negative sense, they're icons and they represent their own sport but they represent the universe of financial interest, they advertise things... for me they are the Latin answers to Posh and Becks,"" Vezzoli told CNN. The Italian believes football clubs have more in common with galleries than you might think. ""People don't like to admit it but you know, the biggest galleries are like the biggest football clubs, and they swap athletes... they are fabled,"" explains Vezzoli. ""There's always a hot name -- there's a young one that everybody's eyes are on, then everybody changes their mind."" Vezzoli also argues that the world's fascination with football could be because the sport represents the pursuit of perfection and beauty. ""In different degrees we are all influenced by the need or the desire of being more perfect, more beautiful."" The collection also demonstrates football art can provide a dialogue for important social issues. Manal Al Dowayan's ""The Choice IV"" shows a Saudi woman holding a football aloft, challenging the limits that religion and tradition can place on women. ""I do feel excluded out of my society -- women are perpetual minors in my Saudi,"" Al Dowayan told CNN. ""The woman in that picture is a young Saudi woman who received a scholarship for high school through football, so she really did play very well -- obviously she doesn't play it anymore because there is no league in the country. ""Everybody watches football. Everybody appreciates a winning team. Sportsmanship, and what it does to an individual, a group, a community is something that everybody should include in their structure, or the fabric of their social existence."" This has been especially true of the Africa Cup of Nations, which had a gripping finale on Sunday: ""The Ivory Coast has gone through many years of struggle and civil war, and for them to win there was such a deep celebration within their country and beyond,"" added Al Dowayan. As the 1in11 auction shows, art really does have a place in football -- whether you're a professional, an artist or a spectator. ""That's what's interesting about football and art -- it includes everybody... it's something that transcends language, politics and borders,"" said Al Dowayan.","Takashi Murakami's 'Lionel Messi and a Universe of Flowers' sells for  $488,000 .

"(CNN)They are unlikely Internet celebrities: two bald eagles tending their young on the campus of Berry College in North Georgia. But there's no denying that they've become an online sensation.  Thousands of people tuned in last weekend to watch as two tiny eaglets emerged from their carefully-guarded eggs, thanks to a live streaming Eagle Cam installed by the school. Since then, online viewers have been able to watch Mom dutifully warming her hatchlings while Dad works around the clock to hunt and bring back food.  The birds have been featured on TV news broadcasts and been the subject of national and international stories.  They even have their own Facebook and Tumblr pages. ""People are personally invested,"" said Christine Reinolds Kozelle, director of news and editorial services at Berry College.  ""You have this 'Truman Show'-like experience.  People want to be part of it and say they saw it happen.  Plus, they are so beautiful."" The eagle pair first appeared on the main campus of Berry College in spring 2012, nesting in a 100-foot pine tree between the main entrance and the athletic center.  Soon, cameras were installed: one on the approach to the tree and two infrared cameras with direct views into the nest. ""When it was discovered, we were really excited about it,"" Kozelle said.  ""Animal science is one of our most popular majors, so there were a lot of very curious people.  We figured we'd put up the camera and we'd be able to sell our story as well.  We had no idea it would be this popular.  No idea.  The first year we put it up, we had to move it because we couldn't handle the traffic; it almost crashed our server."" Kozelle said there have been over 20 million views since the livestream was set up last year.  But interest spiked significantly last week, as the projected ""hatch date"" for the eggs approached.  ""We've gotten calls from all over the world,"" she said.  ""Handling them has become a full-time job in and of itself.  After the U.S., the second largest number of people following us is in Brazil.  Then India.  Then Pakistan."" However, the livestream has revealed aspects of life in the wild that are uncomfortable for some viewers. The winter storm that just moved through the region prompted a flurry of worried posts.  Even more distressing for some has been the behavior of the larger hatchling.  It will peck at its smaller sibling and prevent it from eating -- behavior that has generated a huge amount of commentary online. But school officials point out that this natural behavior for eaglets.  ""It's very common when there is more than one sibling for one to dominate,"" Kozelle said.  ""This is natural, and we don't interfere.  This is a way to educate people about the natural world."" Still, Kozelle understands why it can be difficult to watch this behavior.  ""The struggle with the nest and the temperatures, humans identify with that,"" she said. ""We take care of our children and our homes.  It's easy to get attached."" The eagles bring thousands of visitors to the campus of Berry College.  Kozelle said exact numbers are hard to come by, but she estimates that 5,000 people come for a glimpse of the eagles every year. The college is pleased with all of the attention.  ""One of the wonderful takeaways is that it has brought to light the resurgence of eagles,"" Kozelle said. ""They were endangered, and now they are coming back from the brink.""

"(CNN)Talks between the United States and Iran on the Tehran's nuclear program will resume in Geneva on Friday, Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said. A final outcome to what has been monthslong series of negotiations is expected to have a lasting effect on Iran's relations with the West. Speaking to Iran's IRNA news agency, Araqchi said the talks will be at the deputy ministerial level, followed by a meeting of the two countries' foreign ministers. Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zari and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry are scheduled to join the talks in Geneva on Sunday and Monday, Araqchi said. There was no immediate confirmation from the U.S. side. ""At the end of the four days of bilateral talks between Iranian and US nuclear delegations, discussions will possibly continue with participation of all members of the Group 5+1,"" Araqchi said. Better known as the P5+1, that group consists of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council: United States, Russia, China, United Kingdom and France. The plus one is Germany. A comprehensive agreement could bring about an end to significant sanctions against Tehran and a warming of relations with the West. The absence of a deal would most likely ramp up tensions and could lead to more punitive measures -- and even confrontation -- over Iran's controversial nuclear program. Iran insists that like other countries, it has a right to develop nuclear power for peaceful purposes. But Western powers have accused it of trying to develop not just nuclear energy but nuclear weapons as well.","Kerry and the Iranian PM will meet Sunday, Araqchi says .

"(CNN)""I'm in love with cities I've never been to and people I've never met."" It's a quote that you may have seen online, attributed to best-selling author John Green. The sentiment is certainly thought-provoking, but there's one problem: Green never wrote it. The writer, whose hit book ""The Fault in Our Stars"" was made into a hit movie last summer, made the revelation in a YouTube video he posted on Tuesday, after only recently having realized what he said was a mistake. ""When I saw the quote, I assumed it came from [my book] 'Paper Towns,'"" he said. ""People kept sourcing it as coming from 'Paper Towns.'"" The quote originally popped up on the social network Tumblr, which like other social media is a haven of quotes, both real and not-so-real. Because of what he says was a mistaken belief, Green sold posters of the quote, attributing it to himself. He said he did not remember writing the line, but he doesn't remember writing a lot of things he wrote years ago. In the video, he said, ""Instead of blindly assuming something I'd written, something the Internet said I wrote, I should have done some research."" He was alerted to the fact on Reddit, learning that a teenage fan of his, Melody Truong, had come up with the quote in 2009, and Green was then given credit by many people online as the quote went viral over the years. Green was upset that Truong was being accused of stealing his quote: ""I'm the thief!"" he proclaimed. (Oddly enough, Green said he determined he had never written the line after illegally downloading and digitally searching a copy of ""Paper Towns"" for the quote.) Green fell on his sword in the video, and added that Internet culture as a whole is guilty of this sort of thing. ""We do an epically bad job of acknowledging one another's work and checking our sources."" Green is retroactively paying royalties from sales of the posters to Truong, who learned about the quote being misattributed a few years ago, but didn't think much of it. ""They were just little graphics with the quote on top of images, typical Tumblr stuff,"" she said. Once posters of the quote were sold, ""I felt a bit hurt,"" said Truong, who is now 18. Truong tried to reach out to Green to no avail, but last week her friend posted about it to Reddit and Green responded. ""I'm still in a state of shock about the situation, actually,"" she said. ""I never expected any of this to happen. I've always looked up to John Green as a role model. I know that if this happened to me with another person or company, nothing of this caliber would have occurred. He is the prime example of a wonderful person.""

"(CNN) -- Former New York Giants receiver David Tyree's celebrated catch in the closing seconds of Super Bowl XLII was pivotal to his team's victory. Now out of football, he is trying to claim a last-minute win over another foe -- same-sex marriage. On the same day that the New York State Assembly approved a same-sex marriage bill, Tyree warned of dire consequences if the legislation becomes law. The bill's passage would ""be the beginning of our country sliding toward ... anarchy,"" he said . Tyree made the comments in a video released Wednesday by the National Organization for Marriage, which is spearheading opposition to the bill. The legislation must now clear the Republican-controlled State Senate where its fate is uncertain. His disapproval of gay marriage is based on religious as well as secular grounds, Tyree said. ""Marriage is the only relationship that actually mirrors the relationship with God,"" he said. He also argued that same-sex parents are ill-equipped to raise a child of the opposite sex. ""You can't teach something that you don't have,"" Tyree said in the video. ""So two men will never be able to teach a woman how to be a woman."" It is not justifiable to alter a long-standing institution ""because a minority -- an influential minority -- has ... an agenda,"" he said. In an opinion column for Yahoo News, the group's chairman, Maggie Gallagher, said Tyree told her he decided to speak out after his former teammate Michael Strahan declared his support for gay marriage last week. The video appeared to take a page out of the playbook of the group's adversary, the Human Rights Campaign, which has released a steady stream of video testimonials from celebrity advocates of gay marriage in recent months. Uma Thurman, Whoopi Goldberg, Sean Avery of the New York Rangers and others have appeared in their videos. Tyree seemed to chide notables who oppose same-sex marriage, but keep their opposition to themselves. ""I am disappointed when ... not enough guys ... lift up something as honorable and near to God's heart as marriage,"" he said. ""We're doing God an injustice by not making his heart known to our country.""","The New York State Assembly approves a same-sex marriage bill .

"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- Vice President Dick Cheney arrived Saturday night in Israel, where he pledged America's ""enduring and unshakable"" commitment to the security of the Jewish state as it approaches its 60th anniversary. Vice President Dick Cheney, left, and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert reaffirmed their alliance Saturday. Cheney met with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to kick off a weekend of talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders. ""Our two countries have been more than just strong allies. We've been friends, special friends,"" Cheney said at a news conference with Olmert. ""Both our nations share the ideals of liberty, equality, human dignity and representative government."" ""Both our nations have stood firm against forces of terror and intimidation. ... We are natural allies,"" Cheney added. He reaffirmed that the United States was committed to Israel's ""right to defend itself against terrorism and rocket attacks and other threats from forces dedicated to Israel's destruction."" In turn, Olmert called Cheney ""a very good supporter and friend of the state of Israel.""  Watch Cheney discuss the U.S.-Israel relationship » . The Israeli prime minister said the two leaders would discuss Iran and peace negotiations with the Palestinians as well as Syria and Hezbollah. ""We will always be happy to hear your advice and your observations about these very important issues, which are on the top of the agenda of the state of Israel,"" Olmert told Cheney. Cheney, who spent the past two days in Saudi Arabia, planned to attend an Easter service Sunday in Jerusalem before heading to Ramallah in the West Bank for talks with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Cheney's visit comes on the heels of a similar trip by President Bush, who pushed renewed Mideast peace talks that he hoped would achieve a resolution before his final year in office ends. Cheney reiterated Bush's goals, saying Abbas and Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad ""too can be certain of America's goodwill in this process."" ""It's not America's role to dictate the outcome, but we will help with the negotiations and provide all the support and encouragement we can,"" Cheney said. ""We want to see a resolution to the conflict and an end to the terrorism that has caused so much grief for the Israelis."" Southern Israeli towns have faced a near-daily stream of rocket attacks from Palestinian militants in Gaza for months. In response, Israeli troops launched a five-day push into Gaza this month that left at least 110 Palestinians and two Israeli soldiers dead. And earlier this month, a man armed with an automatic weapon and a handgun slipped into a Jewish seminary in Jerusalem and killed eight students. ""We must not and will not ignore the darkening shadows of the situations in Gaza, in Lebanon, in Syria and in Iran and the forces there working to derail the hopes of the world,"" Cheney said. A delegation of Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives, led by Minority Leader John Boehner of Ohio, also arrived in Jerusalem on Saturday. ""This congressional visit will give us the opportunity to discuss important issues of mutual concern between our two countries, the peace process and regional security, including Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Lebanon,"" Boehner said in a statement.

"Sen. Mary Landrieu made headlines last November when she hitched a ride home on Air Force One with President Obama, but chose not to attend his event in New Orleans. Another lesser-known flight Landrieu took that same day mistakenly cost taxpayers more than $3,000. CNN has learned that the vulnerable Louisiana Democrat used government money to charter a private plane to travel to a campaign fundraiser, in violation of federal law. Landrieu spent more than $3,200 in taxpayer money to fly 400 miles round trip from New Orleans to Lake Charles, Louisiana, where she attended a $40-per person fundraising lunch with hundreds of women, according to Senate records and Landrieu campaign information. It is illegal to spend government money campaigning. Landrieu's campaign spokesman, Fabien Levy, said in a statement that the charter company mistakenly billed Landrieu's Senate office instead of her re-election campaign. Levy said the campaign noticed the error a few weeks ago and asked the company to refund the Senate office and bill the campaign, which the company did. Levy said Landrieu's re-election campaign paid for the flight August 4, almost nine months after the November 8 trip. ""We take our finances very seriously and are glad we caught the vendor's mistake and were able to rectify the matter as soon as possible,"" Levy said. The campaign didn't notice the mistake until July 29. Two days later, on July 31, USA Today published a story showing that Landrieu was one of the Senate's most frequent fliers, spending $47,000 last year on taxpayer-funded charter flights. Levy told CNN that media scrutiny of Senate office expense reports spurred the campaign to review its travel records. Even though the mistake was corrected, the campaign still violated federal law and could face civil fines, said Paul S. Ryan, senior counsel at the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan campaign watchdog. ""It is the senator and the senator's staff responsibility to comply with federal laws. It's not the job of the vendor, per se,"" Ryan said. ""It sounds like their excuse is, 'We didn't do anything wrong; it's the vendor.' It's the job of the senator and her staff not to pay bills out of a Senate office account if those bills were not for Senate business."" Ryan argued that even though Landrieu fixed the error, the law should still be enforced. ""If senators were allowed to pay for their campaign expenses out of taxpayer dollars that challengers don't have access to, that's a major unfair advantage to incumbents,"" he said. Landrieu took the charter flight the same day Obama delivered a speech on the economy in New Orleans. The senator cited her busy schedule as the reason she didn't accompany the President in her hometown. ""I was hosting a lunch in Lake Charles for 300 women and I wasn't going to stand them up. I'm sorry I couldn't be with the President,"" she told CNN's Wolf Blitzer a few days later. At the time, Obama was under fire for the disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov and breaking his promise that people could keep their health insurance coverage under Obamacare. Landrieu's decision not to attend his event was widely seen as an acknowledgment that the President, who was already deeply unpopular in Louisiana, was a political liability for the vulnerable Democrat, especially since she cast a pivotal vote in support of Obamacare. 2013: Jesse Jackson Jr., wife plead guilty to charges involving campaign funds .","$3,200 plane flight bill paid from Senate budget instead of campaign account .

"(CNN)There has been a new twist in the curious case of leading golfer Robert Allenby who last month reported being beaten and kidnapped in Hawaii. Hawaii Police have confirmed they have arrested a 32-year-old man on charges of identity theft, attempted theft and unauthorized possession of confidential personal information. But in a press conference, Lieutenant John McCarthy told reporters there was no evidence of a kidnapping or a physical altercation. ""Honolulu police booked a 32-year-old male this afternoon for three counts of second-degree identity theft, three counts of second-degree attempted theft, and one count of unauthorized possession of confidential personal information,"" the police statement read. ""The suspect was arrested at the Oahu Community Correctional Center where he was being held on a contempt warrant for an unrelated incident. The male has five previous convictions, including one felony drug conviction. ""Investigators identified numerous unauthorized charges made on Mr. Allenby's credit cards. The charges were made at various retail and convenience stores on Oahu. ""No additional suspects are being sought, and this case has been turned over to the Office of the Prosecuting Attorney."" Channel Seven in Australia reported that Allenby told them his initial version of events may not have been accurate because he had concussion and was drugged. Australian Allenby did not respond when contacted by CNN. The police also said there was no credible evidence the golfer had visited a strip club, as was reported by several media outlets. Allenby, a four-time winner on the PGA Tour, was in Hawaii for the Sony Open and after missing the cut went out for dinner on Friday 16 January with his caddie Mick Middlemo and another friend. Soon after the incident the 43-year-old said in an interview with the Golf Channel that as he left the wine bar he was approached by a group of men who then attacked him. ""Somebody hit me and I woke up on the streets in the gutter. I'd been thrown out of the trunk of a car and I'd been robbed,"" said Allenby, who was pictured sporting cuts on his nose and forehead in the interview. ""It was scary, you just never know. You see it in the moves -- I've seen Taken and Taken 2 and it's kind of like a spitting image,"" he added, referring to the 2008 French thriller that starred Liam Neeson. But a woman who witnessed the incident later told Australian network Nine News that she found Allenby a block from the wine bar and not 10 kilometers away as he had suggested. ""Two homeless people were kicking me -- I don't know if they were just trying to see if I was alive. But they were trying to take stuff off me, but all I had on me was my clothes,"" Allenby explained. ""I started running down the street away from them once I'd pulled myself together, and this lady was helping me, she was fantastic."" Asked about the golfer's claims he was beaten, Lieutenant McCarthy said: ""I don't know what physical altercation you are talking about. ""There is no kidnapping investigation going on. I don't want to get into the details but his (Allenby's) story with us has been very consistent."" Allenby released a statement through the PGA Tour on Thursday. ""I want to thank the Honolulu Police Department (HPD) for their ongoing work in this investigation,"" he said. ""As I have continually said, these detectives are the best at what they do and I was always confident they would discover what happened. ""I continue to fully cooperate with the HPD and I look forward to this matter being fully resolved. ""I also want to thank the many people who have expressed their support and concern for me in the last month.""","Honolulu police make an arrest in the case of PGA Tour golfer Robert Allenby .

"(CNN)Limpet teeth may contain the strongest biological material ever discovered, say researchers in the UK. The aquatic, dome-shaped creatures that are found clinging to rocky shores have set a new record previously held by spiders. ""Until now we thought that spider silk was the strongest biological material because of its super-strength and potential applications in everything from bullet-proof vests to computer electronics,"" Professor Asa Barber who led the study said in a statement. ""But now we have discovered that limpet teeth exhibit a strength that is potentially higher."" The researchers from the University of Portsmouth's School of Engineering said they used atomic force microscopy to pull apart the material, almost 100 times thinner than the diameter of human hair, right down to the atom. The findings were published in the Royal Society journal Interface. They are not only surprising, but Barber said they are a source of inspiration for engineering, setting the blueprint for structures such as Formula One racing cars, boat hulls and aircrafts. ""All the things we observe around us, such as trees, the shells of sea creatures and the limpet teeth studied in this work, have evolved to be effective at what they do,"" said Barber. The key substance in the tiny teeth is a hard mineral known as goethite, which forms in the limpet as it grows and enables them to move over rock surfaces and feed on algae while the tide is in. And the teeth maintain their strength regardless of their size. ""Generally a big structure has lots of flaws and can break more easily than a smaller structure, which has fewer flaws and is stronger. The problem is that most structures have to be fairly big so they're weaker than we would like."" said Barber. "" Limpet teeth break this rule as their strength is the same no matter what the size.""","Researchers in the UK say limpet teeth may contain the strongest natural material known to man .

"Put your dog in a bow tie: weird but cute.  Dress your cat in a bear costume: odd, but let the kitty dream. Push your overweight dog in a stroller: ridiculous, but sweet. Give your dog a tattoo covering its entire stomach and pierce its ears with mini barbells: WAIT! The New York Legislature believes some pet obsessions have gone too far. A bill banning the piercing and tattooing of companion animals, the most common of which are cats and dogs, was unanimously passed in both chambers on Wednesday. The bill awaits signing by Gov. Andrew Cuomo. If Cuomo signs the bill, violators face possible fines or imprisonment. The legislation was initially introduced in 2011 when a groomer, Holly Crawford, of Sweet Valley, Pennsylvania, began marketing ""Gothic kittens"" on eBay. New York State Assemblywoman Linda B. Rosenthal, who represents Manhattan, introduced the legislation immediately after reading an article about the kittens, said Lauren Schuster, her chief of staff. The kittens were pierced down their entire back, according to Schuster. That practice was brought to the attention of law enforcement by the animal rights group PETA. The groomer was prosecuted and convicted in Pennsylvania. Court documents showed she was sentenced to six months of electronic home monitoring and a period of probation. Crawford did not return a CNN call seeking comment. Under the New York bill, tattooing is acceptable as a form of identification for animals or to indicate that a medical procedure has been done, but ""not for design purposes."" Animal advocates hope people will move to having pets ""microchipped"" instead. Last year, a North Carolina man came under fire for putting tattoos on his two dogs. Ernesto Rodriguez, a tattoo artist, said he put the intricate tattoos on the bellies of his dogs so they could be easily identified if they were lost, CNN affiliate WGHP-TV reported. New York's bill gained momentum in early March, when a Brooklyn resident tattooed his pitbull while it was having surgery to have its spleen removed. This was the ""catalyst for [the bill] to move again,"" said Schuster. Response from the public and animal rights groups was immediate, said Schuster. ""I think people have a natural knee jerk for something like this,"" she said. People began to ask the question, ""This really happens?"" said Schuster. Under the bill, piercing and tattooing of companion animals would only be allowed for medical or identification purposes and must be performed by a licensed veterinarian. While tattooing in the past has been used as a form of identification, PETA says it prefers the microchip because it is the most effective. ""Under no circumstance should an animal be pierced,"" said Daphna Nachminovitch, senior vice president of cruelty investigation for PETA. Nachminovitch calls the bill a ""wonderful thing"" even though this ""should be common sense,"" she says. While many states have animal cruelty statues, this is the only ban she has heard of to legally ban the tattooing and piercing of companion animals.

"Copenhagen, Denmark (CNN)Mourners gathered Wednesday in Copenhagen for the funeral of Jewish community member Dan Uzan, killed in a weekend terror rampage that also targeted a free speech forum in the Danish capital. Uzan, 37, was providing security for a bat mitzvah party taking place behind a Copenhagen synagogue when the gunman struck. Large numbers attended Uzan's funeral, held at the Mosaiske Vestre Jewish cemetery in Copenhagen amid heightened security. Armed police patrolled the area, and a sniper could be seen on a nearby rooftop. Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt was among those present for the somber ceremony. Danish authorities are continuing to investigate the events that led to the two shootings. The suspect in both attacks has been named as Omar Abdel Hamid El-Hussein, 22. He was killed early Sunday in a shootout with police outside a Copenhagen apartment building. The two police officers who shot El-Hussein fired 30 shots toward the suspect, who was still firing in their direction as he dropped to the ground, the police attorney representing the officers told CNN on Wednesday. Attorney Torben Koch said that the officers were in a car carrying out  surveillance on the suspect when he suddenly made a turn to enter a building. At this point, the police officers pulled over, got out of their cars and called out to him, Koch said. When El Hussein turned, he opened fire using two guns. The officers returned fire with automatic weapons and a handgun. Police have stated the suspect fired three shots using two pistols. El-Hussein was known to authorities as a gang member but was apparently not on their radar for Islamist extremism. The deadly series of events began with the attack on the free speech forum Saturday afternoon. A 55-year-old man was killed in that shooting, named by the Danish Film Institute as director Finn Noergaard. Three police officers were injured in the melee.","The funeral for Dan Uzan, killed in a shooting outside a synagogue, is held in Copenhagen .

"A teenager in India, who had more than 200 ""teeth"" growing in his mouth due to a benign dental tumor, has had them removed. Ashik Gavai, a 17-year-old student from Buldhana, underwent the six-hour operation, which involved four doctors at Mumbai's J.J. Hospital on July 21. The teen had 232 denticles -- abnormal teeth-like growth -- lodged in his mouth due to a complex composite odontoma, a benign dental tumor. The abnormal teeth were embedded in the bone inside the lower right jaw and were not visible from outside the mouth. Surgeons say the surgery was ""dangerous"" and the patient's jawbone will take three to four months to heal. ""It is very common for a person to have a (small) number of abnormal teeth, but this many is very rare,"" said Dr. Sunanda Dhiware, head of the Department of Dentistry at J.J. Hospital. She adds that she knows of cases where 40 to 50 teeth were removed. Gavai's normal teeth are to remain in his mouth, although the doctors did help to remove a wisdom tooth. The teen is currently recovering in the hospital and has been put on a liquid diet of mainly coconut water and milk. According to Dr. Vandana Thoravade, surgeon in the ENT department at J.J. Hospital, the operation could have cost as much as 250,000 rupees (about $4,000), which the Gavai family could not afford. The teen's father is a farm laborer who earns 150-200 rupees ($2-3) a day. The government's Rajiv Gandhi Jeevandayee Arogya Yojana program -- which supports low income patients -- took care of the bill. Gavai's doctors said the denticles likely started to form when the patient was six years old, but Gavai did not notice the abnormal teeth until a month ago, when his mouth began to swell. The village doctors near his home in Buldhana District, about 500 km from Mumbai, were unable to treat Gavai's condition, and referred him to the Mumbai hospital. Doctors say denticles are likely to grow again in Gavai's mouth, but probably not in such a large number. Dental screening that could save your life .

"""We don't negotiate with terrorists,"" has long been the standard refrain of governments when it comes to violent extremists. But these days, when it comes to the realm of social media, they are at least talking to them. In recent years, the U.S. State Department has launched social media efforts to engage jihadists and their sympathizers online, contesting their claims with the intention of dissuading potential converts to Islamic extremism. ""We are actually giving al Qaeda the benefit of the doubt because we are answering their arguments,"" says Alberto Fernandez, coordinator of the State Department's Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications (CSCC), which runs the program. ""The way I see it is we are participating in the marketplace of ideas."" That marketplace is now online, and the corners of it dedicated to Islamic extremist talk can be surreal, noisy, sometimes horrifying places. Jihadist social media: Decapitations, appeals for wives . Like no conflict before, the Syrian war, the prime focus of the world's jihadists, is being discussed, disputed -- and waged, in its propaganda aspects -- on social media. The content ranges from the shockingly grisly to the bizarre. Combatants post photos of decapitated heads as trophies of battlefield victories, or images of victims from their own side, captioned with vows to avenge them. Links to grainy phone-camera footage abound, documenting everything from group executions, to a video appeal summoning Muslim women to come to Syria to find a husband among the Islamist rebels. On Twitter, jihadists post their theological quandaries: how to watch football when it means being exposed to men's bare legs? Often informed by the memes and language of the broader Internet, the content is disseminated swiftly around the world through a diverse network of jihadists and their supporters, journalists, analysts and onlookers. In this way, social media has become a prime conduit for motivating budding extremists to take up arms. A study recently published by researchers at King's College London traces how Western-based radical preachers with strong social media influence have inspired a wave of Western Muslims to fight in Syria, where they are now estimated to account for about a quarter of the 11,000 foreign jihadists in the country. In response to this threat, the U.S. government has been ""messaging"" in social media in Arabic, Urdu and Somali for three years now, attempting to penetrate the virtual echo chambers of jihadist thought with contrary points of view. But it is only since their English-language Twitter feed was launched in December, becoming a pugnacious new voice in the conversation, that their efforts have increasingly drawn attention -- and raised eyebrows -- in the West. This development has led to the spectacle of the U.S. government publicly bickering with jihadists and their ideological fellow travelers on social media, debating Syria, the War on Terror, ""the clash of civilizations"" in 140-character bursts. A typical exchange occurred recently when a pro-jihadist Twitter user admiringly posted an image of a desecrated Buddha of Bamiyan, one of the monumental statues in Afghanistan destroyed by the Taliban in 2001. The CSCC account tweeted in response: ""Destroying ancient culture out of hatred and backwardness are a feature of al Qaeda's ideology."" ""Crying about so-called ancient culture when there was no food and children were dying out of hunger,"" scoffed the Islamist. ""The shortage of food in Afghanistan was due to Taliban's disastrous policies,"" replied the State Department account. Another user chimed in with a tweet at the State Department: ""Al Qaeda just bombed a kindergarten and school with your funding and guns."" Trolling the terrorists? Some observers have been dismissive of the State Department's efforts, conducted under the banner: ""Think Again, Turn Away."" Jonathan Krohn, a journalist who, with a colleague, has launched a Twitter account and podcast dedicated to jihadist social media, and sometimes tussles with the State Department account online, describes their activities as ""trolling."" ""As a psy-op tool, it's pretty laughable,"" he said. ""They target journalists and analysts with as much verve as attacking jihadis."" But others say the efforts appear to having some success at ""getting in the heads"" of senior Islamic militants. ""For years, al Qaeda had gotten in the heads of the U.S. government, and the U.S. government had become very sensitive to various al Qaeda talking points,"" says Will McCants, a scholar of militant Islam at the Brookings Institution, who was involved in setting up the CSCC. ""I felt there's no reason why we can't return that favor... The more you can make them think on these points, the more you can damage their credibility and shape their behavior."" For his part, Fernandez, a former U.S. ambassador to Equatorial Guinea, rejects the ""State Department troll"" label. ""Some people use that because I think it's convenient shorthand for an adversarial relationship,"" he said. ""To me, (a troll) ... is a person who is annoying and obnoxious and stupid. Well, we're none of those things, because we're answering their charges with facts."" But he admits to drawing on the same emotional arsenal as an Internet troll in the center's work. ""People who study the Internet more than I do... mention that the two things that motivate people the most when it comes to social media are comedy and anger,"" he said. ""If you're talking about al Qaeda -- let's face it, it's going to be negative. So it might as well be pointed."" 'An ungoverned space' For the U.S. government, entering the social media fray to argue with terrorists has required a substantial paradigm shift. The default posture had been not to dignify the extremists with a response. But gradually, said Fernandez, the government realized that doing so was simply surrendering ground to their opponents. ""We seek to contest space that previously had been ceded to our adversary,"" he said. Al Qaeda tends to thrive in ""the ungoverned spaces of the world,"" such as ""the Sahara desert, or places in Somalia or Yemen or Syria. The Internet is also an ungoverned space, so it's an area of opportunity for them."" Al Qaeda has long publicly acknowledged the crucial importance of propaganda to their cause, he said, with its leader Ayman al-Zawahiri quoted as saying that ""more than half"" their battle to win the hearts and minds of Muslims was being waged through media. ""We in the West think kinetic strikes or arresting people or fighting... that's important,"" said Fernandez. ""Media stuff... it's secondary or tertiary. Al Qaeda doesn't see it that way."" The aim was also, broadly, to make ""life more difficult for the extremists."" ""It's very easy if you're out there and able to say whatever you want and nobody contradicts you,"" said Fernandez. READ MORE: Unsettling video shows large al Qaeda meeting in Yemen . McCants said the online space taken up by jihadist chatter has expanded and become much more diffuse in recent years, as it had migrated from discussion boards to social media platforms like Twitter, and been increasingly conducted in English. ""There are many more people talking,"" he said, adding that while that meant they could be harder to find, ""once you find them you really can insert yourself and engage directly. They have to listen to it, at least until they block you."" Fernandez said the CSCC's efforts were aimed not at converting extremists -- although ""it would be nice"" -- but reaching the wider audience of onlookers that jihadists were trying to influence. ""In a way, we're picking a fight with the extremists, because the extremists are there to radicalize other people,"" he said. Their ""bread and butter"" was using jihadists' own content to make the case against them, he said, such as when they recently hijacked a hashtag in Arabic -- ""accomplishments of the Islamic state"" -- that had been started by supporters of the bloodthirsty Islamist militant group ISIS. The CSCC account used the hashtag on 176 tweets that Fernandez said listed the true achievements of ISIS: ""Things like poverty, murder, detracting from the decency of the Syrian revolution, helping the Assad regime by trading oil with them."" Is it working? Studies have pointed to the potential shortcomings of this kind of work: that the counter-messaging is simply ignored, as Krohn suggests it often is, or stirs up antagonism by providing an opponent for extremists to rally against. So is the project working well enough to justify its 50 staff and a $5 million a year budget? Fernandez says feedback had been positive and the work would continue, although it was difficult to quantify results objectively. ""We are never going to know ... unless they put up their hand and say 'I saw your stuff and decided not to become a terrorist',"" he said. ""You're almost never going to get that."" The initiative, already active across Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, would look to branch out to other social media where jihadists were active. ""What about Ask.fm? What about Instagram? What about Pinterest?"" said Fernandez. ""In a way, we're mirroring or shadowing what they do."" McCants said he considered the program ""a qualified success,"" and that criticisms of the work tended not to be data-driven. ""I don't think anyone believes this has been a dramatic blow against terrorism recruitment... But I think on this particular measure of getting inside the heads of terrorist recruiters and leaders -- at least in the al Qaeda orbit -- it has been successful."" He believed jihadist groups had been rattled by certain of the CSCC's claims -- in particular, that the victims of Islamic extremists were predominantly other Muslims. It was possible to tell when messaging had struck a nerve, he said, as jihadist leaders would typically respond ""by putting messages out on the discussion boards saying, 'Listen, they're putting these lies out, don't engage them'."" ""We got quite good at this during the Cold War, and then we forgot, because as the only superpower, we didn't really have to do it,"" he said. ""(But) the U.S. government is rediscovering its skills in this sort of thing."" WATCH: What new video reveals about al Qaeda .

"(CNN) -- In 2007 and 2008, the American economy suffered through its greatest crisis since the Great Depression. The Treasury Department estimates that from 2007 to 2009, the heart of the Great Recession, more than 8.8 million American jobs disappeared and more than $19 trillion in household wealth was lost. In response to the crisis, the federal government took steps to reform our financial system, most significantly, passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Signed into law by President Barack Obama four years ago Monday, this bill was designed to improve accountability and transparency in our financial system, ensuring we never again face a financial crisis of this magnitude. Regrettably, Dodd-Frank has done little to address the root causes of this crisis. Instead, by institutionalizing bailouts and undermining a competitive and fair marketplace, this law has joined Obamacare as another example of big government overreach that has ultimately done more harm than good for the American people. Wall Street reform law only half done . At 849 pages, Dodd-Frank touches nearly every aspect of our financial system, from capital ratios of large financial institutions down to new rules on the credit cards most Americans have in their wallets. Dodd-Frank has only grown larger since Obama signed it. Much of the statutory text tasks Washington bureaucrats with writing nearly 400 rules. As of the first of this month, law firm Davis Polk reported 45% of rulemaking deadlines have been missed. Since its enactment, Dodd-Frank has imposed $21.8 billion in compliance costs while producing regulations that require nearly 60 million hours of paperwork with which to comply, according to estimates by the American Action Forum, a center-right policy institute. These compliance costs can be devastating to small community banks and credit unions. Often they are the only financial institutions serving small towns and rural areas such as those throughout my district in western North Carolina. Assuming these small institutions can withstand this Dodd-Frank-induced regulatory onslaught and stay in business, they will join larger banks in passing these added costs along to consumers, driving up the cost of borrowing and reducing access to much-needed credit. Among the great indignities of the financial crisis: American families were footing the bill for the massive taxpayer-funded bailouts of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and other large financial institutions while struggling to scrape by in the broken economy. In 2009, Bloomberg estimated that the U.S. government and other federal agencies had committed nearly $13 trillion to support these failing institutions. The nearly $13 trillion represented 90% of the U.S. gross domestic product for 2008. In signing the law, Obama claimed that never again would the American people foot the bill for these large firms. Yet amazingly Dodd-Frank does not just fail to end these bailouts, it cements them into law and greatly increases the likelihood the American people will be stuck with the federal government's bailout tab again in the future. In addition to an alphabet soup of new agencies, such as FSOC (Financial Stability Oversight Council) and OFR (Office of Financial Research), Dodd-Frank also gave us the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a uniquely (some might say dangerously) unaccountable addition to our federal bureaucracy. Designed with the noble goal of consumer protection, the agency was given significant power to regulate financial offerings but was designed in a manner to leave it free of oversight from both the White House and Congress. Among the agency's ""accomplishments"" is its qualified mortgage rule that has negatively affected credit availability in the mortgage market. The rule has especially harmed those who have typically struggled to access credit in the past, women and minorities. A recent report from the Federal Reserve Board showed roughly one-third of black and Hispanic borrowers would not qualify for mortgages under the rule. Even more troubling is the bureau's latest project, the National Mortgage Database. In an apparent effort to make the National Security Agency jealous, this database will track individual Americans and their personally identifiable information, including the most intimate personal and financial details, going back as far as 30 years. And this does not even begin to address the consumer agency's management failures that have led to claims of discrimination and retaliation against minority employees going unpunished and spending $216 million to renovate its rented office space. Put simply, Dodd-Frank is but another failed big government ""reform"" -- just like Obamacare, the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, and the stimulus.

"(CNN)Forget the cloud, and rework your mental image of those mysterious data centers. Sony has reinvented a tool for storing a mind-numbing amount of data: . A cassette tape. But this isn't one of those rattling plastic tapes you used to compile your ultimate summer road-trip jams and, too often, were probably forced to rewind with a pencil. Sony's record-breaking magnetic tape technology allows it to store 180 terabytes of data on a single cartridge. That's the same amount of storage  as 1,184 iPod Classics, Apple's roomiest music player, which can hold about 40,000 songs. Using that number, Sony's new cassette could technically store about 47.3 million songs of its own. That's enough jams for a really long road trip -- say, driving in Atlanta during a snowstorm. If you're more of a movie buff, think of it this way. The cartridge, which stores 148GB of data per inch of tape, has room for 3,700 Blu-ray discs full of your favorites. The number obliterates the standing record, set in 2010 when Fuji developed a tape that could hold 35 terabytes of data. Sony, which worked with IBM on the tape, presented the new technology over the weekend at InterMag Europe, a magnetics conference in Dresden, Germany. In very simple terms, the technology involves shrinking the microscopic magnetic particles on tape that store data. On average, the new particles are 7.7 nanometers wide. There are 10 million nanometers in one centimeter. In a news release, Sony said it would like to pursue a commercial use for the new cassette tape technology, as well as continuing to improve it. But if you're dreaming of someday popping that tape into some sort of digital-age boombox and pushing ""play,"" you may be in for a bit of a disappointment. Tape has the potential for massive data storage, but it's unwieldy to actually use. Recording to, and retrieving data from, tape takes a lot longer than digital storage devices and players we've become accustomed to in an era of Web streaming. So, it's a lot more likely that tape will be used to back up huge databases than to save, and play, our music collections. That's too bad. We liked the idea of needing only one cassette for a cross-country drive.","Sony has made a cassette tape that can store more than 1,100 iPod Classics .

"(CNN) -- The Syrian regime has carried out a ""systematic"" series of abuses against protesters that could ""qualify as crimes against humanity,"" and the United Nations must hold the government accountable, a leading humanitarian watchdog organization said Wednesday. Human Rights Watch makes these assertions in a report titled ""'We've Never Seen Such Horror': Crimes against Humanity in Daraa."" The 57-page document contains chilling detail from dozens of victims and witnesses to abuses in Daraa province, the southwestern Syrian powder keg where the anti-government protest movement began in mid-March before spreading across the country. The government reacted with a tough crackdown against protesters. At present, the report says, there have been about 887 deaths ""across Syria,"" including at least 418 people in Daraa province. ""For more than two months now, Syrian security forces have been killing and torturing their own people with complete impunity,"" said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. ""They need to stop -- and if they don't, it is the Security Council's responsibility to make sure that the people responsible face justice."" Human Rights Watch said the Syrian government should take ""immediate steps to halt the excessive use of lethal force by security forces"" and that the U.N. Security Council ""should impose sanctions and press Syria for accountability."" If the government ""doesn't respond adequately,"" the council should refer Syria to the International Criminal Court, the group said. One major diplomat on Wednesday echoed the international outrage over Syria's crackdown and raised the issue of ICC involvement. Australian Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd, speaking to the National Press Club in Canberra, said it is ""high time the Security Council"" considered a formal referral of President Bashar al-Assad to the ICC. There was no immediate Syrian government reaction to the report, which ""is based on more than 50 interviews with residents of Daraa and several Jordanian nationals who were in Daraa during the protests."" Human Rights Watch said it has also ""reviewed dozens of videos, filmed by the witnesses, which corroborate their accounts."" The report notes that the demonstrations began in Daraa city with the ""detention and torture of 15 young boys accused of painting graffiti slogans calling for the downfall of the regime"" and that the release of the ""bruised and bloodied"" boys ""fanned the flames of popular anger."" ""On March 18, following Friday prayer, several thousand protesters marched from al-Omari Mosque in Daraa calling for the release of the children and greater political freedom, and accusing government officials of corruption. Security forces initially used water cannons and teargas against the protesters and then opened live fire, killing at least four,"" the report says. The protests then snowballed outside Daraa. Activists have blamed Syrian security forces for the deadly crackdown but Syria has blamed the violence on ""terrorist groups,"" ""armed gangs,"" and ""foreign elements."" Human Rights Watch said witnesses from Daraa ""provided consistent accounts of security forces using lethal force against peaceful protesters."" ""In some cases, security forces first used tear gas or fired in the air, but when protesters refused to disperse, they fired live ammunition from automatic weapons into the crowds. In most cases, especially as demonstrations in Daraa grew bigger, security forces opened fire without giving advance warning or making any effort to disperse the protesters by nonlethal means. ""Security forces deliberately targeted protesters, who were, in the vast majority of cases, unarmed and posed no threat to the forces; rescuers who were trying to take the wounded and the dead away; medical personnel trying to reach the wounded."" The report says witnesses regularly noted ""the presence of snipers on government buildings near the protests"" and ""other evidence obtained by Human Rights Watch also suggests that security forces participating in the operations against the protesters (in Daraa and other cities) had received, at least in a number of cases, 'shoot-to-kill' orders from their commanders."" Several elite army units and branches of the intelligence services were part of the crackdown. ""On several occasions army units deployed to quell the protests seemed reluctant to shoot at protesters, allowed them to pass through checkpoints, and, in at least two cases documented by Human Rights Watch, refused orders to shoot and either surrendered to the protesters or handed over their weapons to the protesters,"" the report says. Many arrests ""seemed entirely arbitrary with no formal charges ever brought against the detainees"" and witnesses described the detention conditions as appalling. ""Released detainees interviewed by Human Rights Watch said that they, as well as hundreds of others they saw in detention, were subjected to various forms of torture and degrading treatment,"" the report says. ""The methods of torture included prolonged beatings with sticks, twisted wires, and other devices; electric shocks administered with Tasers and electric batons; use of improvised metal and wooden 'racks'; and, in at least one case documented by Human Rights Watch, the rape of a male detainee with a baton. ""Interrogators and guards also subjected detainees to various forms of humiliating treatment, such as urinating on the detainees, stepping on their faces, and making them kiss the officers' shoes. Several detainees said they were repeatedly threatened with imminent execution."" The majority of witnesses interviewed by Human Rights Watch also referred to the existence of mass graves in Daraa. There was a punishing Syrian security siege that lasted at least 11 days from April 25 and extended to neighboring towns. ""Witnesses said that Daraa residents experienced acute shortages of food, water (because security forces shot and damaged water tanks), medicine, and other necessary supplies during the siege. Electricity and all communications were cut off for at least 15 days, and, at the time of this writing, remained cut off in several neighborhoods in the city,"" the report says. Authorities put an information blockade into effect on Daraa ""to ensure that abuses were not exposed"" and cell phones with damning videos were regularly confiscated during searches, it says. ""No independent observers could enter the city and one international journalist who managed to report from Daraa during the first two weeks of protests in March was arrested upon his return to Damascus."" From April 25 to around May 22, Daraa residents were not permitted to ""pray in mosques and all calls for prayer were banned,"" the report says. ""Security forces occupied all of the mosques in the city and, according to witnesses who saw the mosques after they reopened, desecrated them by writing graffiti on the walls.""","The Human Rights Watch report focuses on Daraa province .

"(CNN) -- Steven Soderbergh made certain his new movie, ""Che,"" about the life of revolutionary Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara, couldn't be attacked -- at least on a factual level. Steven Soderbergh hewed close to the facts in making the four-hour ""Che,"" starring Benicio Del Toro, right. ""I didn't mind someone saying, 'Well, your take on him, I don't really like,' or 'You've left these things out and included these things.' That's fine,"" Soderbergh said. ""What I didn't want was for somebody to be able to look at a scene and say, 'That never happened.' "" But he's aware that he's going to be accused of romanticizing the Argentine doctor and Marxist guerrilla who helped Cuba's Fidel Castro launch the first and only victorious socialist revolution in the Americas. He doesn't buy the criticism. ""I don't have sort of a personal investment in making him look one way or another,"" Soderbergh said in one interview with CNN. ""I picked [these periods in his life] because I was interested in the specifics of how you wage a war like this -- mostly because I don't believe you can wage a war like this anymore."" In a separate interview, he added, ""He killed people and he was pretty up-front about it, and he was a hard character. And the movie's kind of a process film about trying to wage a certain kind of revolution. ... I think he comes across as pretty tough."" For the director, profiling Guevara meant a lot of research. Soderbergh read everything he could find on Guevara from both supporters and opponents; he wanted to make sure he correctly told the story many Cubans know by heart.  Watch an extensive interview with Soderbergh: Part 1 »  Part 2 » . ""Che"" is the kind of project that few directors besides Soderbergh might try. The director is known for varying his Hollywood productions, such as ""Erin Brockovich"" and ""Ocean's Eleven,"" with quirky personal films such as ""Full Frontal"" and ""Bubble."" ""Che,"" shot in Spanish, is a two-part biographical film that runs more than four hours overall. Part one, ""The Argentine,"" portrays Guevara's role in the revolution that overthrew Cuban leader Fulgencio Batista in 1959. Part two, ""Guerrilla,"" shows his later efforts in Africa and Bolivia. Guevara was executed in Bolivia in 1967 after trying to foment revolution in the South American country. ""I have to say, it is probably one of the most difficult movies I've ever made,"" actor Benicio Del Toro said. ""The way I felt on a Monday in [shooting] this movie is the equivalent to how I felt at the end of the week of another movie."" Del Toro, who also co-produced ""Che,"" plays Guevara in the film, and Mexican actor Demian Bichir plays Castro. Although Del Toro is well known for his Oscar-winning performance in ""Traffic"" (also directed by Soderbergh), Bichir is not as recognizable outside his native country. ""Demian, though, was very crucial,"" Soderbergh said. ""Because if we don't have someone who can go head to head with Benicio and feel like he's just as strong, then the movie doesn't work at all. And I was really impressed by [Bichir's] confidence. Because that's what Fidel really has more than anything, is that confidence."" Soderbergh, who said he was first approached by Del Toro to do the project while making ""Traffic"" in 2000, is just as happy with his language choice for the Spanish-language film. He feels ""Che"" would not have earned respect as an English-speaking movie. ""It seemed weird to make a movie about one of the most vocal anti-imperialists of the 20th century and use the language of the imperialists,"" he said. ""That just didn't make any sense to me."" Soderbergh hopes the practice of doing foreign films in English will go out of practice completely, and Del Toro agrees. The actor believes it is time the United States, Britain and Australia see movies the way the rest of the world has been seeing them for decades -- with subtitles. ""I think it helps relationships,"" Del Toro said. ""I think it's good to have movies from different cultures. And, you know, the only way you are going to understand them is [with] subtitles."" Though he was born and spent part of his childhood in Puerto Rico, Del Toro -- who describes himself as ""a Hollywood actor"" -- said speaking Spanish in ""Che"" didn't come easy. ""I'm lucky that I'm bilingual,"" he said. But Soderbergh readily admits he was greatly affected by the language barrier. Fortunately, he added, he understands enough Spanish to know when there was a problem with translation, and the rest he accepted peacefully. ""I found it really pleasant to not understand the language completely, because then it becomes like music and you can tell when the notes don't sound right,"" he said. The cast filmed on location in Spain, Mexico, Puerto Rico and Bolivia. While Soderbergh was frustrated by the U.S. embargo on Cuba that kept him from filming in the country itself, he enjoyed working in remote places without distractions. ""I like the 'man with the movie camera' aspect of going out there and getting stuff that you can't get any other way,"" Soderbergh said. ""I got a sense that that part really did appeal to Che. That he really did love being out there with the group, doing this one thing that they were trying to do."" The New Year marks the 50th anniversary of Guevara and Castro's overthrow of the U.S.-supported dictator Batista. Though realizing Cuba and its revolutionary personalities remain a subject of controversy in America, Soderbergh hopes people take a step back and look at the big picture from the perspective of history. ""I think there's a lot of information, a lot of detail about both these campaigns -- Cuba and Bolivia -- that don't generally come out in the stories about these two battles,"" he said. ""I thought it was all pretty interesting."" Del Toro agreed. ""Because I got this job, I learned a lot about -- more than what I knew -- about the history of Latin America, the history of Cuba, the history of the '60s,"" he said. ""That was part of the fun of doing this movie.""","Steven Soderbergh's new film a four-hour epic on Che Guevara .

"This year's Nobel Prize for Chemistry was awarded to an Israeli scientist who ""fought a fierce battle against established science"" and ""fundamentally altered how chemists conceive of solid matter,"" the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced Wednesday. Daniel Shechtman ""tore apart what we thought we knew about crystals,"" a scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said. Shechtman discovered that crystals do not have to have a regular repeating pattern, Peter Mueller said, comparing the revelation to the fall of the Berlin Wall. ""There are a few things that you know in life, like 'The Berlin Wall is not going to fall.' That was one of things that I knew growing up in Germany,"" Mueller said. Shechtman's discovery in 1982 was as disruptive to chemistry as the fall of the wall was to world politics, Mueller said. The very definition of a crystal was that it was ""periodic,"" or that its molecules were packed together in a regular, repeating way. ""Dan Shechtman comes along and proves us all wrong,"" said Mueller. ""It's the next step in crystallography. It is outrageous. It is fantastic. Before Dr. Shechtman's discovery, this was thought impossible. It absolutely deserves the Nobel."" Shechtman is a professor at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology. His discovery is called quasicrystals. Unlike other crystals, quasicrystals do not have a repeating pattern at the molecular level.  They are very hard, but break easily, like glass. Interestingly, the structure of quasicrystals seems to have been foreshadowed in medieval Islamic art that contradicts what Western geometry had always taught. ""If you want to tile a bathroom floor with squares, you can do it out to infinity,"" said Peter J. Lu, a post-doctorate researcher at Harvard University  who has studied Islamic tile work. ""If you want to do it with five-sides figures, there are gaps,"" he explained. But Islamic artists figured out how to do it without leaving gaps by making the pattern irregular rather than repeating -- the same thing that happens in quasicrystals, he said. ""Aperiodic mosaics, such as those found in the medieval Islamic mosaics of the Alhambra Palace in Spain and the Darb-i Imam Shrine in Iran, have helped scientists understand what quasicrystals look like at the atomic level,"" the Swedish academy said. Islamic tile patterns dating back to the early 1400s were put together in ways not understood in the West until 1973, Lu and Paul Steinhardt of Princeton University argued in a paper in 2007 in the journal Science. The Muslim artists discovered ways to tile shapes with five, 10 or 12 shapes without leaving gaps between them -- a structure thought by standard geometry to be impossible. British mathematician and physicist Roger Penrose explained in 1973 how it was done, and just over a decade later the same pattern was found at the molecular level in quasicrystals, according to a report in Lu and Steinhardt's work in the journal Nature in 2007. Lu said he was ""thrilled to pieces"" that Shechtman had won the prize. ""The discovery was incredibly monumental, and he's just the nicest guy,"" Lu said. Mueller, a principle research scientist at MIT, said he was ""fascinated"" by the structure of quasicrystals, even as he admitted he would not have the knowledge to analyze them himself. But specialists in quasicrystals will eventually ""gain knowledge of some structures which we cannot analyze with conventional methods,"" he predicted. The academy that awards the Nobel Prize in Chemistry said quasicrystals have a ""unique atomic structure"" which makes them ""bad conductors of heat and electricity, and (they) have nonstick surfaces."" ""Their poor thermal transport properties may make them useful as so-called thermoelectric materials, which convert heat into electricity,"" the academy said. The prize in chemistry is worth 10 million Swedish kronor (about $1.44 million). On Tuesday, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences named Saul Perlmutter from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of California, Berkeley; Brian P. Schmidt of Australian National University and Adam G. Riess of Johns Hopkins University and the Space Telescope Science Institute, the winners of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics. They made the discovery that our universe apparently is expanding at an accelerating rate some 14 billion years after the Big Bang. The Nobel committee on Monday named Ralph Steinman, a biologist with Rockefeller University, and scientists Bruce A. Beutler and Jules A. Hoffmann, the winners of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The announcement came three days after Steinman died of pancreatic cancer at age 68. This week, the committee also will announce prizes in literature and peace. The prize in economics will be announced Monday.","Daniel Shechtman's discovery was like the fall of the Berlin Wall, a scientist says .

"Sen. Mary Landrieu will reimburse the Senate more than $5,700 for a charter flight she paid for with taxpayer money after CNN questioned the expense. The Louisiana Democrat chartered a private plane last September to travel from New Orleans to Shreveport, where she attended an official event. She then traveled on to Dallas, where she attended a fundraiser. Under federal law and Senate rules, the cost of a trip that includes official and campaign stops must often be prorated between Senate and campaign accounts. However, if the campaign activity is ""incidental"" to the official trip, the expense doesn't need to be split up. In this case, Landrieu's Senate office picked up the whole cost of the trip. Asked Wednesday about the trip, Landrieu's Senate spokesman, Matthew Lehner, said in a statement: . ""Sen. Landrieu was invited to an official evening event in Shreveport. She was traveling back to D.C. through Dallas, and a fundraiser in Dallas was added to her schedule,"" he said. ""Out of an abundance of caution in case there was a cost allocation error connected to this flight, the Senate will be reimbursed for the (Shreveport to Dallas) flight."" A Senate aide said that because Landrieu was already going to be in Dallas, the office considered the fundraiser incidental and not an expense that had to be partially covered by the campaign. The reimbursement comes just one day after CNN learned that the vulnerable Louisiana Democrat used government money last November to charter a private plane to travel to a campaign fundraiser, in violation of federal law. Landrieu spent more than $3,200 in taxpayer money to fly 400 miles round trip from New Orleans to Lake Charles, Louisiana, where she attended a $40-per person fundraising lunch with hundreds of women, according to Senate records and Landrieu campaign information. It is illegal to spend government money campaigning. Landrieu's campaign spokesman, Fabien Levy, said in a statement Monday that the charter company mistakenly billed Landrieu's Senate office instead of her re-election campaign. Levy said the campaign noticed the error a few weeks ago and asked the company to refund the Senate office and bill the campaign, which the company did. Levy said Landrieu's re-election campaign paid for the flight August 4, almost nine months after the November 8 trip. ""We take our finances very seriously and are glad we caught the vendor's mistake and were able to rectify the matter as soon as possible,"" Levy said. The campaign didn't notice the mistake until July 29. Two days later, on July 31, USA Today published a story showing that Landrieu was one of the Senate's most frequent fliers, spending $47,000 last year on taxpayer-funded charter flights. Levy told CNN that media scrutiny of Senate office expense reports spurred the campaign to review its travel records.","Louisiana Sen.

"It was late in the day with the House oversight hearing on Benghazi winding down. On social media and elsewhere, there was conservative grumbling that Hillary Clinton was getting off relatively unscathed. Then came conservative Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina's second round of questions. ""If anyone wants to ask 'What difference does it make?' it always matters whether or not you can trust your government,"" Gowdy said, borrowing some words from the former secretary of state. ""And to the families, we're going to find out what happened in Benghazi, and I don't give a damn whose career is impacted,"" Gowdy continued. ""We're going to find out what happened."" Tough legitimate congressional oversight or partisan politics? Leading Republicans say the former; most Democrats the latter. Truth is, it is both. And as the Benghazi investigations continue, that presents both parties with challenges. For Republicans, if they want public support for continued hearings and questions beyond the GOP's conservative base, the challenge is to stress the legitimate questions about the Obama administration's response to the deadly attack on the U.S. consulate -- and its conflicting explanations of why it believes the attacks happened. House Speaker John Boehner served notice on Thursday that GOP pressure would not subside. The speaker said the administration should make public a series of e-mails and other records he said would provide key details about the attacks and the response. Boehner calls for White House to release Benghazi emails . Among the records, he said, should be an e-mail from a top State Department official from the day after the attack. The e-mail, Boehner said, refers to ""Islamic terrorists"" as carrying out the attack. ""A senior State Department official e-mailed her superiors that the Libyan ambassador, she had told the Libyan ambassador, the attack was conducted by Islamic terrorists. The State Department would not allow our committees to keep copies of this e-mail when it was reviewed,"" Boehner said. The White House and its allies in Congress make the case that any confusion and conflicting information in the early hours and days after the attacks stemmed from the ""fog of war"" -- not  any deliberate effort to mislead the American people about the source of the attacks. Doomed Libya ambassador: 'We're under attack' Traveling in Rome, the man who replaced Clinton, Secretary of State John Kerry, said he was as determined as the Republican House leadership to answer any legitimate questions. ""I have already made it crystal clear to the chairmen of the relevant committees that I have assigned my chief of staff, David Wade, to be responsible for liaising with them to answer any questions that they have,"" Kerry said. ""I am absolutely determined that this issue will be answered, will be put to bed."" ""And if there is any culpability in any area that is appropriate to be handled in some way with some discipline it will be appropriately handled. But that judgment awaits me in a report that will be forthcoming and I am confident that any recent evidence will be a component of that consideration,"" Kerry said. Gregory Hicks, who became the top diplomat in Libya after Ambassador Christopher Stevens was killed, suggested at Wednesday's House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing that he was demoted and otherwise punished or making it clear he believed the Obama administration was withholding or ignoring key facts about the Benghazi attacks and response. After hearing, Republicans say there's more to story . The committee chairman, California GOP Rep. Darrell Issa, said Democrats on the panel had shown little interest in finding the truth. In turn, committee Democrats, including ranking member Elijah Cummings of Maryland, said Issa and other GOP members were to blame for a reckless campaign designed to ""smear public officials."" Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, took the most direct heat because of her assertions in a Sunday television interview days after the attack that linked the attacks to a demonstration outside the Benghazi consulate. Hicks said there was no demonstration and that top State Department officials had been told that, and he told the committee he was ""stunned"" and ""embarrassed"" by Rice's televised account. What the Obama administration has said about the Libya attack . The administration concedes Rice spoke from flawed talking points, but insists the mistakes were born of understandable confusion. Many Republicans see it differently -- alleging the Obama White House, in the closing days of the presidential campaign, wanted to play down the idea of a successful, coordinated terrorist attack on a U.S. diplomatic post. ""I do think that was the political motivation behind it,"" Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio said Thursday on Fox News. ""What I think is sad is how many people around the administration, including the former secretary of state, Secretary Clinton, knew this to be the case, and allowed this to move forward anyway. Mother of Benghazi victim: I blame Hillary . ""You would've hoped that people would have stepped up and said this was wrong and the American people deserve the truth. That didn't happen."" Democrats are quick to suggest it is Rubio playing politics, noting his own interest in a possible 2016 presidential campaign. Democrats make the same argument when asked about the harsh criticisms of Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul, another potential 2016 Republican contender. Paul calls Clinton's handling of Benghazi a ""dereliction of duty"" that, in his view, disqualifies her from higher office. Boehner tried to take a less confrontational tone on Thursday, but nonetheless said the White House was refusing to make public e-mails and other documents he says show the political calculation behind the Rice TV appearance and other elements of the administration's Benghazi response. ""The White House continues to claim it only made stylistic changes to talking points used by Susan Rice, ignoring the fact that senior White House officials directed the changes being made"" to those talking points, Boehner said. Conservative media outlets also clearly see an opportunity to raise questions about Clinton that could be a factor in her 2016 calculations. Respected conservative writer and commentator Terence Jeffrey reminded his readers this week of the initial Clinton Benghazi statement suggesting, ""Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the internet."" Jeffrey said the State Department refuses to provide information about who told Clinton an Internet posting might be a possible cause. Hicks told the hearing on Wednesday that U.S. diplomats in Libya reported back from the very beginning that they believed it was a terrorist attack. Among the conservatives urging House Republicans to demand answers from Clinton directly is former Vice President Dick Cheney. On Thursday, Cheney spoke to the weekly ""Theme Team"" meeting organized by House conservatives and two people present at the breakfast said the former vice president said if Clinton declined to voluntarily answer questions, then she should be subpoenaed to testify. Another veteran of the George W. Bush administration also weighed in Thursday, in a way that highlights the intersection of Benghazi oversight and Benghazi politics. In an e-mail sent to conservatives, former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton said, ""What happened with Benghazi is not how it's supposed to be handled and I think it could be a hinge point for the Obama administration."" The Bolton note was distributed by the House GOP's campaign arm -- the National Republican Congressional Committee -- and asks for political contributions to the GOP. In fact, if you click on the links in that Bolton e-mail, it takes you to an NRCC fund-raising website that declares ""Benghazi was a cover-up"" over a photograph of Clinton and President Barack Obama. That definitive assertion on a House GOP official fund-raising site is par for the course in Washington these days. But it gives Democrats fodder for their argument that Republicans have already made up their minds and aren't conducting oversight hearings with an open mind. Clinton is now a private citizen. But close allies on the committee, including New York Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney, came to Clinton's defense during the proceedings. And other longtime Clinton political loyalists were privately nudging reporters and media outlets about the tone of the Benghazi coverage. One veteran Democratic strategist, who spoke only on condition of anonymity because Clinton chafes at those who publicly speculate about her 2016 interest, noted her overwhelming popularity among Democrats. ""She will have to deal with this,"" the strategist said, ""but it will not be central to the campaign."" Longtime Clinton ally and Democratic strategist Paul Begala takes a similar view. ""Once more, the GOP runs the risk of appearing to be blinded by their partisanship,"" Begala said. ""I have no idea if Hillary will run. But I know this: If she does this issue will not be a major stumbling block."" Begala drew historical comparison -- between Clinton now and then-Vice President George H.W. Bush heading into the 1988 presidential campaign. ""Remember Iran-Contra?"" Begala asked. ""Infinitely more damaging than Benghazi. The Reagan administration sold weapons to the ayatollah's regime in Tehran, then diverted some of the proceeds to the (Nicaraguan) Contras, then lied about it. The scandal paralyzed the Reagan administration for 18 months."" There were high-level resignations and criminal convictions, Begala recalled. ""There was a major joint congressional investigation, with highly publicized, televised hearings. There was a special prosecutor. It was one of the biggest scandals of the 20th century. And two years later, it had no impact on Vice President Bush's campaign.""","Republicans say Benghazi investigation legitimate congressional oversight .

"(CNN) -- The Ebola outbreak in West Africa has hit ""unprecedented"" proportions, according to relief workers on the ground, with the WHO reporting 844 cases including 518 deaths since the epidemic began in March. There is no cure or vaccine to treat Ebola, but the aid agency MSF has shown it doesn't have to be a death sentence if treated early. Ebola typically kills 90% of patients but the death rate in this outbreak has dropped to roughly 60%. One man who survived the disease describes how the virus took hold. How did you contract Ebola? I am an agronomist and I have two children, one boy and one girl. I work in the pharmacy at the health center of Gueckedou in southern Guinea. When my father was hospitalized at the health center I naturally volunteered to be at his bedside so other family members would not have to make the daily trek of tens of kilometers, traversing the trails between their village and the facility. I cleaned him when he vomited and also did his laundry. I also often gave him food and drink. He had diarrhea at least eight times per day but I did not know he was suffering from Ebola. Five days after being hospitalized, [my father] passed away. After his death the medical staff realized he had presented Ebola symptoms and as I had close contact with him, it meant that I was at risk. So they told me that I needed to be followed up for 21 days and if ever I felt a small fever I had to come to the health center. The countdown then started for me: after nine days I got fever and this persisted until the 11th day. Finally I went to the treatment center -- where I did an Ebola test which was positive. What were the symptoms? How did you feel while you were ill? I first got a fever which persisted. My body temperature reached nearly 40C (104 degrees Fahrenheit). After that I had diarrhea, vomits, dysentery and hiccups [all symptoms of Ebola]. I went to the toilet several times a day and I felt so tired and uncomfortable. How and where were you treated? I received medical assistance at the Ebola treatment center, put in place at the health centre of Gueckedou. The medical staff provided me with oral medications and infusions. They also provided me with food. I suffered at lot in the beginning with diarrhoea and hiccups but with the treatment I started to feel better. What was the initial reaction in your home village after you recovered? Joy, for my family because everyone thought that I would not survive this disease as many others people had died. However before the medical staff released me to go back to my family they tested me three times to make sure that I really had recovered. Afterwards they gave me a certificate of discharge. They also visited my family, the leaders and elders of my community to inform them that I had recovered and I was no longer contagious. Despite this, I was stigmatized. Some people avoided me in the beginning but now, over time, they have learned to accept me. Now they call me ""anti-Ebola."" You're now working with Red Cross volunteers in Guinea to raise awareness of the disease: what lessons are passing on? I am part of a team of Red Cross volunteers, visiting communities, raising awareness on how to prevent the spread of the disease. One of the messages I try to pass on to the communities is to go early to the health center when sufferers first feel symptoms. The treatment is free of charge. People there will give you food and clothes and you can get a chance to survive. What's your message for the outside world about Ebola? How can they help? Everyone should be mobilized. We need to educate people and increase the sensitization. This is the key to stop the dangerous disease Ebola. Many people have already died, that is why I participate in activities [to educate people]. I urge people to go the isolation and treatment centres if they experience the earliest symptoms of the disease, to increase their chance of being cured and surviving.","The WHO reported 844 cases including 518 deaths since the Ebola epidemic began in March .

"Official documents, correspondence and other papers from the period of time Chuck Hagel held his U.S. Senate seat are closed to public viewing by the archives entrusted to hold them. The lack of access has created yet another controversy around the embattled nominee to become the next defense secretary, raising questions among some about whether he might be hiding something in those files. GOP critics of Hagel call on Obama to withdraw nomination . The ruckus started earlier this week when a reporter from the conservative publication, the Weekly Standard, tried to access the documents but was rebuffed by administrators at the University of Nebraska, Omaha. The documents were given to the school by Hagel, who retired from the Senate after two terms in 2009. The archive is comprised of legislative papers, including speeches, memos, handwritten letters, photos and other correspondence Hagel accumulated during his 12 years in office, according to the school. Republicans not happy with Hagel, some of whom have questioned whether he has been truthful about his position on issues from Iran to Israel and Hezbollah, are now wondering what might be in his archives. In a statement to CNN, a spokesman from the University of Nebraska, Omaha, said there is good reason to deny access to the papers. ""Once the archive is processed and indexed, according to the standards and best practices of the Society of American Archivists, they will be open to the public. Until that time, they are not open to the public. We are working toward the day when the archive is processed and available to researchers,"" Charles Reed, a media relations coordinator at the school, said. A spokesman for Hagel would not comment beyond what the university said and referred CNN to the school. But some members of Congress looking for any documents that might contradict statements Hagel made at his recent confirmation hearing in the Senate say he is not living up to his pledge to be forthcoming about his record while he served there. Hagel letter disavows alleged old comments on Israel . ""The University of Nebraska flatly denied a direct request from our office that they provide access to the archives to Senate staff and journalists,"" a spokesman for U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk (R- IL), said in an e-mailed response to CNN. Kirk's office made the request earlier this week. ""The archive is filled with videos, speeches, letters, notes and other information about Sen. Hagel's record that senators have a right to review. We have requested Sen. Hagel's assistance in opening up the archive and are waiting for a reply from his confirmation liaisons at the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Sen. Hagel promised he would provide senators access to all available information about his record and Sen. Kirk remains hopeful Sen. Hagel will keep his word,"" according to the statement. Steve Shorb, dean of the University of Nebraska at Omaha's library, which houses the Hagel archives, says the status of the file is not unique. ""To my knowledge, none of the other senators who left office around that time have open archives either — these things take a long time,"" Shorb said. Two former senators, who left office in the same year as Hagel, also have archives housed at public universities which are not open to the public or researchers yet. The archives of Sen. Pete Domenici and Sen. Ted Stevens are kept by the library at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces and the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, respectively. The website of the Domenici archives said boxes of documents arrived between 2007 and 2008 and are still being sorted and catalogued. ""The entire collection will take several years to complete,"" according to the Domenici archive website. The archive for Stevens, who died in 2010, said the collection arrived the previous year and ""parts of the collection that are not restricted will be reviewed and made available as soon as archival processing is complete.""","Hagel's official papers from Senate service housed at university .

"3-D television was heralded as the breakthrough technology of the 2010 Consumer Electronics Show. Hot on the heels of James Cameron's eye-opening Avatar, 3-D HDTVs were everywhere on the show floor. One year later, at CES 2011, 3-D was back again -- this time iterating. We saw bigger 3D HDTVs, 3-D displays that didn't require special glasses, and camcorders that captured 3-D content. But where is 3-D now? It's certainly not showing up big on our CES 2012 radar, and now looks like over-hyped technology in hindsight -- especially to those of us who always thought 3-D's natural home was in the movie theater, not the living room. Indeed, a variety of obstacles -- high prices, a lack of 3-D content, and uncomfortable viewing experiences -- have kept 3-D TV adoption in the single digits nationwide. Manufacturers and content providers are working to address these issues, but one has to wonder if 3-D was nothing but a flash in the CES pan -- a technology story rather than anything consumers actually wanted. In 2010, consumers purchased a paltry 1.1 million 3-D TV units, and although sales have grown in the two years since, the widespread 3-D fervor that TV manufacturers were anticipating never took root. According to a January Display Search report, just more than 23 million 3-D TVs were shipped in 2011 worldwide, with only 3.6 million shipped in the U.S. Display Search analyst Paul Gagnon says that U.S. household penetration for 3-D TVs is at about 3%. ""To be fair, 3-D TVs have only been available for sale in a significant way for about 18 months, so that's why the penetration is so low,"" Gagnon says. ""That said, it's still lower than what many in the industry had hoped for."" Markets like China and western Europe are seeing far more enthusiasm for 3-D TV than in North America, but worldwide adoption is still likely less than 2%. So what's to blame? The content, for one. ""We have disappointed our audience multiple times now, and because of that I think there is genuine distrust -- whereas a year and a half ago, there was genuine excitement, enthusiasm and reward for the first group of 3-D films that actually delivered a quality experience,"" Dreamworks animation chief Jeffrey Katzenberg said in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. After ""Avatar,"" a string of unsuccessful, rushed-to-market 3-D flicks -- we're looking at you, ""Clash of the Titans"" -- zoomed to theaters hoping to cash in on the craze. Moviegoers were left with a bad taste in their mouths (and oftentimes headaches, too, as 3-D viewing can cause eyestrain). Since then, better-quality 3-D films like ""Tron: Legacy,"" and, more recently, ""Tin Tin"" and ""Hugo,"" have tried to improve 3-D's image. Meanwhile, small-screen content providers have branched out to provide live and on-demand 3-D offerings. Currently, there are 55 3-D channels worldwide, including ESPN 3-D. Another 35 channels offer 3-D content on-demand. If content and a disillusioned audience are the biggest problem, that's bad news for manufacturers: They have zero control over the content side of the equation. To this end, 3-D TV manufacturers are doing whatever they can to make the 3-D viewing experience as pleasing and trouble-free as possible. This includes doing away with uncomfortable, unattractive 3-D glasses, which have also been cited in studies as barriers to consumer adoption. LG, for one, has announced it's making 3-D glasses that are lighter and more stylish. But even handsome 3-D specs can't mitigate the headaches and fatigue suffered by some viewers of 3-D content, or the high prices of 3-D TVs. So, yes, 3-D TVs are expensive. And they can cause headaches. And they aren't supported by a lot of quality content. All of which begs the question: Who's buying these things at all? The existing sales, however paltry, can be attributed to consumer desire to purchase high-end TVs. Consumers don't really want 3-D specifically, but if they want that priciest, top-of-the-line unit, they'll receive 3-D capability whether they like it or not. ""Sometimes consumers are even unaware [that they're getting a 3-D set] at the time of purchase,"" Futuresource Consulting's Fiona Hoy said. Whatever the reason for purchase, the most recent studies indicate consumers are slowly warming up to 3-D. An October report from the Digital Entertainment Group found that the majority of 3-D TV owners say the experience is positive: 88% of those surveyed rated 3-D picture quality positively, and 85% of those 3-D TV owners prefer to watch more than half of their programming in 3-D. As prices come down, more content becomes available, and 3-D glasses improve (or are replaced by glasses-free technology), 3-D TV adoption will only increase. Whether we reach the near 50% adoption rates that have been projected for 2014 and 2015 is yet to be seen. But whether you like it or not, 3-D does not appear to be in its death throes just yet. Yes, we'll see new 3-D displays and accessories at CES next week, but you can rest assured the manufacturers' over-reaching hype campaigns are over.","3-D television now looks like over-hyped technology in hindsight .

"Just this summer, the British government was directly targeting illegal immigrants with a campaign that turned heads, and, in many cases, turned stomachs. In an initiative designed to persuade illegal immigrants to pack up and voluntarily return to their home countries, officials deployed two trucks to drive around London for a week. Each vehicle carried a large billboard with the message: ""In the UK illegally? Go home or face arrest."" Then it offered instructions to text the word ""home"" to a government-run number for ""free advice and help with travel documents."" What was the free advice? Sounded like ""Get the hell out!"" Not exactly the Welcome Wagon, was it? The campaign stirred up so much public outcry that the government backtracked and decided to keep the trucks in the garage. But there's more, and it's still happening. According to a recent article in The Wall Street Journal, the Conservative Party of Prime Minister David Cameron has pledged to reduce annual net migration to the United Kingdom. For the British, the problem is Eastern Europeans. The annual figure of newcomers is about 200,000. The conservatives want to bring it down to the tens of thousands. This is just plain foolish. Just who does the British government think is going to swoop in and take over the jobs that are left behind if immigrants are run off? British citizens? Not blooming likely. By now, several generations of British citizens have grown up thinking of these kinds of jobs as beneath them and themselves as entitled to better. They're not going to miraculously change their way of thinking and find their way back to this kind of work just because the immigrants are gone. European countries -- Great Britain, France, Germany, etc. -- don't have the best track record of dealing with racial and ethnic differences. Besides, it's not every day that a country puts up a ""no vacancy"" sign to keep out even those immigrants who come legally. Most countries like to at least maintain the pretense that they only have a problem with illegal entrants. If nothing else, this approach is refreshingly honest. It seems that Americans haven't exactly cornered the market on bigotry and xenophobia. Sure, we have our own peculiar issues with the foreign-born. It's not easy being a nation of immigrants that has, in reality, always despised immigrants. It's tough being a country that boasts about its diversity, and then does everything it can to boil it away in the fabled melting pot. But we Americans are not alone in our narrow-mindedness. Just about every industrialized country on the globe vacillates between needing immigrants to do jobs that natives won't do and resenting the changes that immigrants bring with them. Parts of the immigration debate playing out on the national and international stage are complicated. And yet this part is simple: Countries that encourage legal immigration, and make the process easier, will thrive. Those that pull up the drawbridge and put up barriers to keep out even immigrants who try to enter legally will founder. Who says? Economists say so. Life experience says so. U.S. history says so. World history says so. This is true of legal immigrants whether they come from China, Vietnam, India, Brazil or any other country. Yet it is also the case with illegal immigrants, as former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan made clear in April 2009 when he testified before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Refugees and Border Security. Greenspan said illegal immigration make a ""significant"" contribution to U.S. economic growth by providing a flexible workforce and that illegal immigrants act as a ""safety valve"" for the economy since demand for workers goes up and down. ""There is little doubt that unauthorized, that is, illegal, immigration has made a significant contribution to the growth of our economy,"" Greenspan said in calling for an overhaul of U.S. immigration laws. We can assume Cameron's government didn't get the news. After those trucks drove around six areas of London, humanitarian organizations, opposition parties and labor groups in the United Kingdom complained that the tactics were offensive and heavy-handed. They said they harked back to an ugly time in British history when nativist groups had much greater sway in the halls of government. What a shame that this is what has become of a once-great nation and one of the world's great superpowers. Now the United Kingdom is in a defensive stance, trying to ward off invaders and hold on to what it has. Contrast all this with what is happening in Israel. Consider the diversity of the tech corridor in Tel Aviv, where some of Silicon Valley's most successful companies come to poach workers and invest venture capital. Everywhere you go, you're reminded that Israel is one of the most diverse nations in the world and one with a proud immigrant tradition. Israeli officials will tell you, without hesitation, that much of what has been accomplished in the country's lifespan of only 65 years can be attributed to the fact that this tiny country benefits from immigrants and draws the best and brightest from around the world. Of course, no nation is perfect. The Israelis have their own problems with immigration. They struggle with the challenge of assimilation of refugees from Sudan and Ethiopia. But still, they understand the restorative power of immigration. Meanwhile, at least the United Kingdom's government realized the error of its ways when it shelved the billboards. Government officials acknowledged that the message was too blunt and the results unconvincing. Score one for decency and common sense.

"For years, the payments went out of the woman's bank account. Nobody batted an eyelid. Bills were paid. And life went on as normal in the quiet neighborhood of Pontiac, Michigan. Neighbors didn't notice anything unusual. The woman traveled a lot, they said, and kept to herself. One of them mowed her grass to keep things looking tidy. At some point, her bank account ran dry. The bills stopped being paid. After its warnings went unanswered, the bank holding the mortgage foreclosed on the house, a common occurrence in a region hit hard by economic woes. Still, nobody noticed what had happened inside the house. Nobody wondered out loud what had become of the owner. Not until this week, when a worker sent by the bank to repair a hole in the roof made a grisly discovery. The woman's mummified body was sitting in the back seat of her car, parked in the garage. The key was halfway in the ignition. Authorities say they believe the woman died at least five years ago. They're still trying to figure out what happened. ""I've been doing this 37 years. Never seen anything like this before,"" said Undersheriff Mike McCabe of Oakland County, just outside Detroit. Rarely heard from . The woman, who the sheriff's office believes to be Pia Farrenkopf, paid her bills from her bank account through auto-pay, according to McCabe. If she were still alive, Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard said, Farrenkopf would be 49 years old. Neighbors said they didn't know much about the woman, describing her as of German descent. ""She really kept to herself. We never really heard anything from her,"" neighbor Caitlyn Talbot told CNN affiliate WXYZ. Talbot said she wasn't aware of anyone having seen the woman, who traveled a lot, in about six years. ""She was probably there for a couple of days, then she'd leave for a week, then she'd come back. Then she'd leave for a month and come back,"" Talbot said. McCabe says neighbors chalked up the woman's absences to her returning to Germany for long periods of time. According to the sheriff, Farrenkopf's employer last saw her in September 2008. Despite years without a living owner, the house was never broken into, Talbot said. And McCabe said  one of the neighbors cut the grass for years. Authorities told WXYZ that the house appears to have black mold inside, and that detectives entered the building Thursday wearing hazardous material suits. Bouchard, the county sheriff, said Friday that there were few outward signs of anything awry. Her mail didn't pile up, since the post office was collecting it. And nothing inside in her home or car pointed to a cause of death. ""Nothing remarkable (was) found in the home,"" the sheriff said. Cause of death undetermined . Police were dispatched to the house for a welfare check in 2007 after a neighbor reported not having seen the owner in a while. After seeing no signs of anything amiss, police went on their way, McCabe said. While authorities believe the body is that of Farrenkopf, they will rely on dental records to positively identify her. Farrenkopf's estranged sister has been contacted, according to the undersheriff. Authorities are awaiting for a toxicology report, which will take four to six weeks, before determining the cause of death. The medical examiner found no signs of trauma to the body, McCabe said. Dr. Bernardino Pacris, the county deputy medical examiner who conducted the autopsy, told the Detroit Free Press that the woman's skin was still intact, but that the internal organs had decomposed. Bouchard, the country sheriff, noted that her body was inside a closed vehicle inside a closed garage -- and, thus, not exposed to outside air or other factors that might contribute to decomposition. Pacris told the newspaper that during the mummification process, skin develops a parchment-like consistency and leathery texture. Finding a body in such a condition is unusual, he said, but ""once in a while, we see this.""","Authorities believe the dead woman is Pia Farrenkopf, who would be 49 .

""It started to rain. Students were complaining about being hungry. The school provided some snacks, finally, at about 10 o'clock in the morning."" Callers into the CNN Voting Hotline reported waits in the St. Louis, Missouri, suburbs of Jennings and Velda City as long as four to six hours.

Election officials throughout Missouri reported extremely high turnout rates, on track to meet the state's projected 76 percent voter turnout rate, said Secretary of State spokesperson Laura Egerdal. While that doesn't meet the 77 percent voter turnout the state reached in 1992, the higher number of registered voters will likely translate to a larger number of overall votes, Egerdal said. In the battleground state of Virginia, voters reported waits as long as five hours in Norfolk.

"What happened in Benghazi, Libya, was a tragedy -- not a scandal.  And no amount of Republican witch hunting or wishful thinking will make it otherwise. Now a new e-mail ""reveals"" what was already plainly known, that the White House participated in crafting talking points in the aftermath of attacks in Libya and around the globe.  Republicans claim the White House ""politicized"" the talking points.  The irony, of course, is that Republicans have been desperate to politicize Benghazi from day one.  Fueled by the  relentless conservative message machine, it can be hard to have a reasonable discussion about Benghazi, one that relies on facts.  So let's try to have that conversation here. What exactly are the Republican accusations regarding Benghazi? The main Republican critique appears to be that the White House and State Department politicized talking points given to U.N Ambassador Susan Rice, who spoke about the attacks on American TV five days later.  Republicans argue the White House deliberately downplayed the involvement of al Qaeda and played up the spontaneous nature of the protests as a reaction to an anti-Islam video, to avoid tarnishing President Obama's national security record in advance of the 2012 presidential election.  This, despite the fact that the White House talking points matched those produced by the CIA. Republicans also have criticized the Obama administration for not responding to the attacks more aggressively when they happened, though a bipartisan Senate investigation found that military resources simply weren't in position to help.  Similarly, Rep. Darrell Issa, the Republican most aggressively pressing Benghazi accusations, says he has ""suspicions"" that Hillary Clinton gave ""stand down"" orders to stop military resources from deploying to Benghazi even though a Republican report to the Armed Services Committee says that no such ""stand down"" order was issued. In addition, Republicans have criticized the Obama administration for not doing more to prevent the attacks, such as beefing up consular security.  Yet it was the same House Republicans who initially denied the Obama administration's request for additional embassy security funding. What do we believe actually happened that night in Benghazi? The answer to that question depends on when you're asking it.  We know that the killing of four Americans on September 11, 2012, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, was in part the result of pre-coordinated terrorist activity.  According to an extensive investigation by The New York Times, ""The attack does not appear to have been meticulously planned, but neither was it spontaneous or without warning signs.""  The Times also reports that the attack was ""fueled in large part by anger at an American-made video denigrating Islam."" But in critiquing the Obama administration's comments in 2012 in the moments during and after the Benghazi attack, what would seem more relevant is what the White House and intelligence community reasonably believed was happening. After all, at the same time as the unrest in Benghazi, violent outbursts very clearly in reaction to the anti-Islam video were going on in Egypt, Yemen and Sudan.  The night of the Benghazi attacks, Al Jazeera reported they appeared to be spontaneous protests against the anti-Islam film. Of course we don't know the classified intelligence, but it would not seem preposterous to believe what was happening in Benghazi was more spontaneous protests rather than pre-planned terrorism.  And even if affiliates of al Qaeda were suspected to be involved, it's not surprising that the intelligence community would not want to show its hand amid active efforts to track and capture those responsible. It was the CIA that removed the reference to al Qaeda, according to e-mails released to CNN by the White House. Here is what Susan Rice said, four days later, that in retrospect seems so wildly misleading to conservatives: . ""Our current best assessment based on the information that we have at present is that, in fact, what this began as was a spontaneous, not a premeditated, response to what had transpired in Cairo. In Cairo, as you know, a few hours earlier, there was a violent protest that was undertaken in reaction to this very offensive video that was disseminated. ""We believe that folks in Benghazi, a small number of people, came to the embassy to—or to the consulate, rather—to replicate the sort of challenge that was posed in Cairo. And then, as that unfolded, it seems to have been hijacked, let us say, by some individual clusters of extremists who came with heavier weapons, weapons that, as you know, in the wake of the revolution in Libya, are quite common and accessible. And it then evolved from there."" That seems not only responsibly cautious in the wake of a complicated and still-unfolding national tragedy, but strikingly accurate. But the talking points were edited!  For political motivations! That's what talking points are, they are the way political figures on both sides of the aisle attempt to tell the facts in the most favorable light.  That said, the CIA gave both parties in Congress the same ""talking points"" it prepared for  Rice.  And, as noted, there are plausible national security reasons for not wanting to show our entire intelligence hand amid an active investigation. This responsible caution stands in direct contrast, for instance, to the Bush administration deliberately distorting not only talking points but also actual intelligence reports for political purposes to justify the war in Iraq.  Or consider that just hours after the Benghazi killings, even before the White House had made a statement, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney condemned the Obama administration's response.  Those talking points were definitely political. The talking points not only seem consistent with events on the ground at the time but with what we now know, per The New York Times and several congressional reports.  Yet that hasn't stopped Sen. John McCain from suggesting that editing talking points amounted to a ""cover-up"" and Rep. Eric Cantor from saying the White House ""misled"" the American public. Can't we have an honest, open investigation and settle this once and for all? We have.  Several times.  And then some.  So far, Politico reports, Republican congressional investigations on Benghazi have included ""13 hearings, 25,000 pages of documents and 50 briefings.""  In a letter written in March 2014 responding to a request for information from a ranking Democrat in the House Armed Services Committee, the Pentagon notes: . ""The department has devoted thousands of man-hours to responding to numerous and often repetitive congressional requests regarding Benghazi, which includes time devoted to approximately 50 congressional hearings, briefings and interviews which the department has led or participated in.  The total cost of compliance with Benghazi-related congressional requests sent to the department and other agencies is estimated to be in the millions of dollars."" A bipartisan report by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence determined that ""there were no efforts by the White House or any other executive branch entities to 'cover-up' facts or make alterations for political purposes.""  The report did say the attack could have been prevented and blamed the State Department, military and U.S. intelligence community for failing to do so. What difference does it make? Great question.  And one taken from a quote by Hillary Clinton, made during her testimony on Benghazi to the House Oversight Committee.  Conservatives use the line to suggest that Clinton is callous toward the loss of life in Benghazi.  No.  Here's the full context: . Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin: ""No, again, we were misled that there were supposedly protests and that something sprang out of that -- an assault sprang out of that -- and that was easily ascertained that that was not the fact, and the American people could have known that within days and they didn't know that."" Clinton: ""With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they'd go kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again. ""Now, honestly, I will do my best to answer your questions about this, but the fact is that people were trying in real time to get to the best information. ...  But you know, to be clear, it is, from my perspective, less important today looking backward as to why these militants decided they did it than to find them and bring them to justice, and then maybe we'll figure out what was going on in the meantime."" ""I take responsibility,""  Clinton said four days after the Benghazi attacks, before Susan Rice ever said a word.  ""I do feel responsible,"" Clinton reiterated at the hearings in January 2013.  When things went wrong in Benghazi, the Obama administration took responsibility. But when Republicans have the facts wrong on Benghazi, they don't do the responsible thing and drop it.  They keep pursuing their partisan witch hunt, wasting millions of taxpayer dollars desperate to smear Obama and 2016 presidential front-runner Clinton with anything that will stick. The facts on Benghazi simply do not undercut the Obama administration, but that won't stop Republicans from digging for mud.","Sally Kohn: GOP has been desperately ""politicizing"" Benghazi since it happened .

"Japanese fishermen rounded up more than 250 bottlenose dolphins in a secluded cove to kill for meat or sell into a lifetime of captivity, U.S. conservationists warned. The annual hunting of dolphins at Taiji Cove highlights the rift between conservationists worldwide who see it as a bloody slaughter and Japanese who defend it as a local custom. The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society first raised the alarm over the plight of the dolphins Friday, saying five separate pods of bottlenose dolphins had been ""driven into Taiji's infamous killing cove."" The group warned that the dolphins would ""face a violent and stressful captive selection process. Babies and mothers will be torn from each other's sides as some are taken for captivity, some are killed, and others are driven back out to sea to fend for themselves."" By the end of Saturday, 25 dolphins had been removed from their pod and taken ""to a lifetime of imprisonment,"" the group said. One of them died in the process and will be butchered, it said. The dolphins will be kept penned in the cove for another night before the selection process begins again Sunday. 'Panicked, frightened and fatigued' The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society live-streamed video of events in the cove Saturday and posted frequent updates on Twitter. ""Killers continue to ruthlessly wrap bottlenose dolphins into nets and drag them to the shore for selection,"" one update said. Another, a few minutes later, said, ""Panicked, frightened, and fatigued, another portion of the bottlenose pod is driven closer to the shore."" ""Killers and trainers tore half of the pod apart today, and will finish tomorrow,"" was the final post on the day's hunt. Caroline Kennedy, who was sworn in last year as the U.S. ambassador to Japan, tweeted her condemnation of the process. ""Deeply concerned by inhumaneness of drive hunt dolphin killing,"" she said. The U.S. government ""opposes drive hunt fisheries."" CNN was unable to reach anyone at the town office for Taiji, a community of about 3,000 that juts into the Pacific Ocean, or the local fishermen's union for comment. But local officials have reacted angrily in the past to Western criticism of what they say is a traditional practice dating back centuries. Officials say criticism is biased, unfair . A 2009 Oscar-nominated documentary film, ""The Cove,"" brought the issue of dolphin hunting in Taiji to the fore with bloody scenes of dolphin slaughter. The Wakayama Prefecture, where Taiji is, condemned the film in an online response as distorted, biased and unfair to the fishermen. ""The Taiji dolphin fishery has been a target of repeated psychological harassment and interference by aggressive foreign animal protection organizations,"" it said. ""Taiji dolphin fishermen are just conducting a legal fishing activity in their traditional way in full accordance with regulations and rules under the supervision of both the national and the prefectural governments. Therefore, we believe there are no reasons to criticize the Taiji dolphin fishery."" The Japanese practice of whale hunting has also put it in conflict with the views of much of the world. Japan's fleet carries out an annual whale hunt despite a worldwide moratorium, taking advantage of a loophole in the law that permits the killing of the mammals for scientific research. Whale meat is commonly available for consumption in Japan. Environmental activists warn that dolphin meat, also sold for consumption in Japan, contains dangerously high levels of mercury and other toxins. 'Stop the cruel slaughter' Celebrities joined in the condemnation of the latest Taiji dolphin hunt via Twitter. Former Guns N' Roses drummer Matt Sorum, who works with the Dolphin Project, posted in support of Kennedy's message, saying he had been to Taiji himself. ""You could be a world hero if you can put pressure to stop the cruel slaughter in Taiji,"" he said to Kennedy. Actress Kirstie Alley tweeted, ""HUNDREDS of DOLPHINS awaiting SLAUGHTER in #THECOVE ... JAPAN, STOP THIS HORROR!!"" CNN first learned about this story through a CNN iReport posted by Martha Brock, an environmental attorney and activist in Georgia. ""There are activists around the world that are calling the embassy and the press, but I knew I couldn't do much, so I wrote this iReport,"" she said.","More than 250 dolphins have been herded into a cove by fishermen, U.S conservationists say .

"George Zimmerman ""didn't do anything unlawful"" and was ""justified"" in shooting 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, according to one of the jurors who acquitted Zimmerman. The woman, known as Juror B37, spoke exclusively to CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360."" Part 1 of the interview aired Monday, and part 2 aired Tuesday night. Shortly after the interview segment Tuesday, four other jurors released a statement responding to her comments. ""We, the undersigned jurors, understand there is a great deal of interest in this case. But we ask you to remember that we are not public officials and we did not invite this type of attention into our lives,"" they said. ""We also wish to point out that the opinions of Juror B37, expressed on the Anderson Cooper show were her own, and not in any way representative of the jurors listed below."" The jurors identified themselves only by their jury pool numbers. CNN Exclusive: What Juror B37 said that left people riveted . Juror B37 told CNN she wanted to find Zimmerman guilty of ""not using his senses,"" but that ""you can't charge him with anything because he didn't do anything unlawful."" She said Zimmerman ""started the ball rolling"" and could have avoided the situation by staying in his car. ""But he wanted to do good. I think he had good in his heart, he just went overboard,"" the juror said. Asked later whether she thought Zimmerman was within his rights, she was unequivocal: ""He was justified in shooting Trayvon Martin."" Opinion: Best way to respond to Martin verdict? Vote . 'We can't give them the verdict that they wanted' The woman was part of a six-person, all-female jury that found Zimmerman not guilty. As the first juror to speak about the case, she offered insight into what happened behind closed doors. The jury was initially split -- three and three along the line of guilt -- she said. Juror B37 was among those who believed Zimmerman was not guilty from the start. There was one holdout, the juror said. ""She wanted to find him guilty of something, but couldn't because of the way the law is written. He wasn't responsible for negligible things that he had done leading up to that point,"" she said, stressing that she and the other jurors took their responsibility seriously. ""I don't want people to think that we didn't think about this, and we didn't care about Trayvon Martin, because we did. We're very sad that it happened to him,"" she said. The juror said she cried after the verdict and before it was read. At one point during the interview, she struggled to speak as her voice cracked. To Martin's parents, the juror said she would tell them that she is terribly sorry for their loss. ""I feel bad that we can't give them the verdict that they wanted, but legally, we could not do that,"" she said. Her emotion was echoed in the statement from the four other jurors. ""The death of a teenager weighed heavily on our hearts, but in the end we did what the law required us to do,"" they said. Martin friend 'upset, angry' by verdict . 'I hope he gets some peace' Just as she believes Zimmerman was guilty of not using common sense, Juror B37 thinks Martin was not without fault. ""I believe he played a huge role in his death,"" she said about the teenager. ""He could have ... When George confronted him, and he could have walked away and gone home. He didn't have to do whatever he did and come back and be in a fight,"" she said. The juror had no doubt that Zimmerman feared for his life. She said she didn't have a strong impression of Martin. ""All we really heard about Trayvon was the phone call that he had, and the evidence they had found on him. We basically had no information what kind of a boy Trayvon was, what he did. We knew where he went to school and that was pretty much about it, and he lived in Miami,"" she said. Asked about what role race might have played in the trial, which grew into a national debate about gun laws and race in America, the juror said it did not matter. Zimmerman did not target Martin, who was African-American, because of the color of his skin, she said. The juror believes he profiled him because of the suspicious way he acted. ""I don't think race had anything to do with this trial. I mean just because he was black and George was Spanish or Puerto Rican, I don't think it had anything to do with this trial. But I think people are looking for things to make race play a part,"" the juror said. She added that she hopes Zimmerman will be able to move on. ""I hope he gets some peace,"" she said. ""I hope his family can live a normal life after a while. I don't know how he's ever gonna do that, but I hope he can. He'll never forget, but I hope he can.""

"On March 10, 1968, Sen. Robert F. Kennedy made a pilgrimage to the central California farm town of Delano to attend a Catholic Mass and to help Cesar Chavez break a 25-day fast intended to draw attention to the plight of farmworkers. Some of Kennedy's advisers had warned him not to go. He was thinking about entering the race for president, and his inner circle worried that the gesture to Chavez, president of the United Farm Workers, might antagonize farm groups, a powerful political force in the San Joaquin Valley. Kennedy went anyway, citing his fondness and respect for Chavez, whom he called ""one of the heroic figures of our time."" Weakened by his fast, Chavez still managed to write a powerful statement that was read by a union supporter, the Rev. Jim Drake. It went: ""It is my deepest belief that only by giving our lives do we find life. I am convinced that the truest act of courage, the strongest act of manliness is to sacrifice ourselves for others in a totally nonviolent struggle for justice. To be a man is to suffer for others. God help us to be men!"" Obama to honor iconic Latino activist with new monument . Kennedy responded by telling those who had gathered: ""When your children and grandchildren take their place in America, going to high school and college, and taking good jobs at good pay, when you look at them you will say, 'I did this, I was there at the point of difficulty and danger.' And though you may be old and bent from many years of hard labor, no man will stand taller than you when you say, 'I was there. I marched with Cesar!'"" President Obama made his own pilgrimage Monday to the farmland of central California. In his first visit there as president, Obama will formally establish the Cesar E. Chavez National Monument on a piece of property in Keene, east of Bakersfield.  Known as Nuestra Senora Reina de la Paz, or Our Lady Queen of Peace, the property served as the national headquarters of the United Farm Workers. Kennedy made his visit despite the politics of the day, but Obama's visit is all about politics. The Chavez dedication is some campaign aide's bright idea of how to turn out Latino voters -- 70% of whom support Obama over Mitt Romney -- on Election Day. It's a rookie mistake -- the kind you expect from people whose knowledge of America's largest minority is limited to mariachis and margaritas. I have studied and written about Chavez and the United Farm Workers for more than 25 years. I was also born and raised in the San Joaquin Valley,  where so much of the UFW drama played out. I had a confrontation with Chavez in 1990 over the union's failures, and I've had a few run-ins since then with UFW Vice President Delores Huerta. And I can tell you this much: Politically, Obama hit a foul ball. Chavez has significance as a historical figure. It is because of the UFW that farmworkers now have clean water and toilets in the fields, collective bargaining, lunch breaks and other legal protections. But Chavez was never a leader for all Latinos. Mexicans and Mexican-Americans might represent more than two-thirds of the U.S. Latino population, but the other third is made up of Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Dominicans and others. To them, Chavez probably means nothing. Even Mexican immigrants don't have a stake in the legend of Cesar Chavez; they hear the name, and most of them probably think of the great Mexican boxer, Julio Cesar Chavez. The group that Chavez has the strongest hold on is Mexican-Americans, but not all of them. He matters to baby boomers, but not to Generation X or the so-called millennial generation. And given that most Mexican-Americans now live in the cities -- Los Angeles, Phoenix, Denver, San Antonio, Dallas -- how are they supposed to relate to the memory of someone who was focused on the farms? In the end, the small sliver of Latinos who will be impressed by Obama's gesture -- Mexican-American lefties over 50 -- was going to vote for him anyway. So where's the benefit? Last, most Latinos disapprove of the president's heavy-handed immigration policies and record number of deportations. It's immigration, stupid, say Latino voters in Nevada . Chavez earned many titles in his life, but ""champion of immigrants"" was not one of them. He was primarily a labor leader who was concerned about illegal immigrants undercutting union members, either by accepting lower wages or crossing picket lines. He never pretended to be anything else, and he resisted attempts by others to widen his agenda. When he pulled workers out of the field during a strike, the last thing he wanted was to see a crew of illegal immigrant workers take away his leverage. According to many historical accounts, Chavez ordered union members to call the Immigration and Naturalization Service and report illegal immigrants who were working in the fields so that they could be deported. Some UFW officials were also known to picket INS offices to demand a crackdown on illegal immigrants. In the 70s, the UFW set up a ""wet line"" to stop undocumented Mexican immigrants from entering the United States. Under the supervision of Chavez's cousin, Manuel, UFW members tried at first to persuade Mexicans not to cross the border. One time when that didn't work, they physically attacked and beat them up to scare them off, according to reports at the time. The Village Voice said that the UFW was engaged in a ""campaign of random terror against anyone hapless enough to fall into its net."" A couple of decades later, in their book ""The Fight in the Fields,"" journalists Susan Ferris and Ricardo Sandoval recalled the border violence and wrote that the issue of illegal immigration was ""particularly vexing"" for Chavez. UFW loyalists will never admit to this ugly history. But that doesn't change it. And this is the person Obama is honoring today with a national monument? One immigration hardliner paying his respects to another. I guess, in some perverse way, that makes sense. But it won't make most Latino voters any more enthusiastic about re-electing Barack Obama.

"A group of former service members who left the military because of the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy will get the full separation pay they were denied, according to a recent $2.4 million court settlement. The settlement was announced this week by the American Civil Liberties Union, which sued the U.S. government on behalf of about 181 troops who were honorably discharged for violating the pre-2011 military ban on service members being openly gay. ""There was absolutely no need to subject these service members to a double dose of discrimination by removing them from the armed forces in the first place, and then denying them this small benefit to ease the transition to civilian life,"" said Laura Schauer Ives, an ACLU lawyer. The total payment in the settlement is about $2.4 million or about $14,000 per former service member, according to the ACLU. The lead plaintiff in the case, according to court documents, was Richard Collins, a former staff sergeant in the Air Force who served for nine years until he was discharged. Military club closes ranks to gay wife . Collins was stationed at a New Mexico base before he was seen by a co-worker kissing his boyfriend in their car while stopped at an intersection off-base, the ACLU said. Collins applauded the decision. ""This means so much to those of us who dedicated ourselves to the military, only to be forced out against our will for being who we are,"" said Collins. ""We gave all we had to our country, and just wanted the same dignity and respect for our service as any other veterans."" The settlement covers service members who fit the criteria and were discharged after November 10, 2004, the ACLU said. The policy, known as ""don't ask, don't tell,"" had been in place since 1993, and had permitted gays and lesbians to serve in the military, provided they didn't reveal their sexual orientation. The policy, first enacted during the Clinton administration, was officially repealed on September 20, 2011.","The settlement was announced this week by the  ACLU .

"A U.S. soldier charged with plotting to blow up troops from the nation's largest Army post has been found guilty of a battery of federal charges, prosecutors announced Thursday. Naser Jason Abdo was found guilty of attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction, attempted murder of federal employees, and weapons charges, the U.S. attorney's office in Waco, Texas, said. Prosecutors said the 22-year-old private first class wanted to bomb a restaurant frequented by soldiers from Fort Hood, in Killeen, Texas. Special coverage: The Fort Hood shootings . Abdo was absent without leave from Fort Campbell, Kentucky, when he was arrested in Texas in July 2011. Prosecutors said he was in the process of building a bomb when he was caught.

But he said he went AWOL after military police learned he had visited gun stores and bought a variety of tools he planned to use in that attack, including a cattle prod, handcuffs and shovels. Instead, he turned his attention to Fort Hood, where another Muslim-American soldier, Army Maj. Nidal Hasan, is accused of gunning down 13 comrades and wounding more than 30 others.

"Aimee Curry recalls sitting on her couch one day, her back contorted, as spasms -- remnants of a car accident that almost killed her in 1992 -- rippled up and down her back. A friend who had been visiting that day left, saying she would bring back some medication. ""She came back with pot,"" said Curry, who says at first she was aghast. ""I was like, 'I can't smoke that, my daddy said no,'"" said Curry, 39, whose father is an ordained minister. ""'I can't do that, it's bad.'"" ""But I was in so much pain, and they were promising me, 'Aimee, this will take the pain away.'"" Curry ignored the preaching voice in her head and tried the marijuana. Soon after she mastered the inhale, she says, her back muscles relaxed. Her pain did not melt away -- it still hurt when she finally got up from the couch -- but, Curry said, ""I didn't care."" ""It states in the Bible not to abuse a drug, it doesn't say you can't use it,"" said Curry.  ""If you ask me, cannabis is a gift from God."" Dr. Sanjay Gupta: 'Doubling down' on medical marijuana . While some in the religious community may take issue with Curry's interpretation of the Bible, the scientific foundation for cannabis as a medical treatment, especially as it relates to treating pain, is solid. Pain is the most common condition for which medical cannabis is taken, and one of the few for which there is promising clinical data in humans. According to doctors who prescribe cannabis for pain, the current wave of U.S. legalization is bringing an unintended side effect: a greatly-reduced need, and in some cases complete cessation, of opioid-based prescription medications. Dr. Mark Rabe, a Northwestern University School of Medicine-trained physician who treats Curry, said he sees it among his own patients. ""Patients often come into my office and drop down a brown bag full of pill bottles on my desk and say, 'I'm off Oxycodone; I'm off muscle relaxants. I'm off Ambien; I'm off Trazodone,' because medical cannabis does the job better,"" said Rabe, who runs Centric Wellness in San Diego. ""Time after time these patients tell me that medical cannabis works better than the pills, and with fewer side effects."" Side effects of cannabis are well-known to both medical and recreational users -- dry mouth, red eyes and insatiable cravings -- while opioids' side effects can include nausea, constipation and an ironic hyper-sensitivity to pain. A more stark contrast between the two: Since 1999, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the number of accidental overdose deaths associated with opioids (also called opiates) went up about 400%. Cannabis researchers say it is virtually impossible to overdose on cannabis. ""Cannabis has such a good safety profile and is much less addictive than opiates,"" said Rabe. ""In my mind, cannabis is a good potential replacement for opiates."" Dr. Donald Abrams, a leading researcher on pain and cannabis, said that clinical data supports cannabis as a treatment for pain -- especially among cancer and HIV/AIDS patients with neuropathy, a painful condition involving nerve damage. What's up with legalization of medical marijuana . Anecdotally, he said he has encountered many patients who have used cannabis to either reduce their need for opioids or get rid of them altogether. Abrams described a recent scenario involving a 58-year-old patient with diabetes suffering with neuropathic pain. ""She had already lost two toes and they told her in the ER not to use cannabis for her pain relief,"" said Abrams, chief of hematology and oncology at San Francisco General Hospital.  ""She said to me, 'When they give me pain meds they make me feel awful, and cannabis works.'"" It may work, but among pain physicians, receptiveness to cannabis as a viable therapy is muted, and complicated. One such physician said that the debate is not about whether cannabis-based medications -- like Marinol, which is approved for use in patients by the Food and Drug Administration -- help with pain, especially among cancer patients. They do, he said. ""I think that debate should be put to rest,"" said Dr. Jay Joshi, CEO and medical director of National Pain Centers, adding that overzealous proponents may be clouding the real issues surrounding cannabis.  ""I see the enthusiasm for marijuana kind of like the enthusiasm we had for opiates years ago. ""A few years down the road I think you're going to see problems from this liberalization of marijuana,"" he added.  ""We've seen these pendulums swing before and reality is somewhere in the middle."" Joshi said that, despite how it is framed, cannabis is not always safe. Some of the hundreds of chemicals inhaled when cannabis is smoked, he said, are lipophilic -- they have an affinity for fat cells -- so that they stick to nerve and brain cells for months or years. That could prove problematic over the long-term, he said. And, Joshi said, smoked marijuana introduces hundreds of chemicals to the body, some of which could prove harmful to the brain over time. 3-year-old is focus of medical marijuana battle . ""I don't think (cannabis) is risk-free and there's no long-term potential side effects,"" said Joshi, who also is chief medical officer and director of Wellness Center USA.  Those who tout that, he said, ""are drinking a little too much of the Kool-Aid. No medication is risk-free."" The issue, say cannabis researchers, is relative risk. To bolster his case for cannabis Rabe cites patient safety data. According to the FDA, in 2011, 98,518 patients died in association with drugs approved by the agency, while 573,111 had serious outcomes -- hospitalization, disability, or some other life-threatening situation. ""Nearly 100,000 die from FDA-monitored drugs,"" said Rabe.  ""If you look at those kind of numbers and then you hear about the properties of cannabinoids, it makes sense that there is increasing interest in something other than what pharmaceuticals have to offer."" What medicine offers in the distant future may reside somewhere between what doctors like Rabe and Abrams -- and Joshi -- are currently offering their patients. A small study, authored by Abrams, published in 2011, found that taking cannabis in combination with opioids may enhance pain relief, reduce side effects of opioids and --  possibly most importantly -- reduce the dosage needed for both drugs. More, and bigger, studies need to echo those results -- and cannabis needs to be rescheduled by the Drug Enforcement Agency -- before mainstream pain physicians get onboard. Right now, it is a Schedule I drug -- what the DEA classifies as ""drugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse."" ""If (cannabis) was rescheduled I think there are a lot of physicians, including myself, that would not only reconsider it but would probably prescribe it,"" said Joshi.  ""A lot of doctors are scared to prescribe something when the actual drug itself is Schedule I."" In the meantime, patients like Curry, who have become staunch proponents of medical cannabis, are confounded by the debate. ""I don't get why the government can recommend narcotics, your doctor can prescribe you Percocet or Oxycontin and you can literally die if you take too much,"" said Curry.  ""But if you smoke too much pot you'll just ... fall asleep."" She said that her father's voice alternates between a whisper and roar in her mind as she considers her future use of medicinal cannabis. Today, she is leaning toward honoring her father. But when the pain comes, ""God's gift"" may override everything.","Aimee Curry found marijuana helped her pain .

"The theory of evolution. The theory of relativity. The Cat in the Hat. All were brought to you by introverts. Our culture is biased against quiet and reserved people, but introverts are responsible for some of humanity's greatest achievements -- from Steve Wozniak's invention of the Apple computer to J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter. And these introverts did what they did not in spite of their temperaments -- but because of them. As the science journalist Winifred Gallagher writes: ""The glory of the disposition that stops to consider stimuli rather than rushing to engage with them is its long association with intellectual and artistic achievement. Neither E=mc2 nor Paradise Lost was dashed off by a party animal."" Watch an interview with Susan Cain . Introverts make up a third to a half the population. That's one out of every two or three people you know. Yet our most important institutions -- our schools and our workplaces -- are designed for extroverts. And we're living with a value system that I call the New Groupthink, where we believe that all creativity and productivity comes from an oddly gregarious place. Picture the typical classroom. When I was a kid, we sat in rows of desks, and we did most of our work autonomously. But nowadays many students sit in ""pods"" of desks with four or five students facing each other, and they work on countless group projects -- even in subjects like math and creative writing. Kids who prefer to work by themselves don't fit, and research by educational psychology professor Charles Meisgeier found that the majority of teachers believe the ideal student is an extrovert -- even though introverts tend to get higher grades, according to psychologist Adrian Furnham. TED.com: Carl Honore praises slowness . The same thing happens at work. Many of us now work in offices without walls, with no respite from the noise and gaze of co-workers. And introverts are routinely passed over for leadership positions, even though the latest research by the management professor Adam Grant at Wharton shows that introverted leaders often deliver better results. They're better at letting proactive employees run with their creative ideas, while extroverts can unwittingly put their own stamp on things and not realize that other people's ideas aren't being heard. Of course, we all fall at different points along the introvert-extrovert spectrum. Even Carl Jung, who popularized these terms in the first place, said there was no such thing as a pure introvert or a pure extrovert -- that ""such a man would be in a lunatic asylum.""  There's also a term, ambivert, for people who fall smack in the middle of the spectrum. But many of us recognize ourselves as one or the other. And culturally we need a better balance of yin and yang between the two types. In fact, we often seek out this balance instinctively. That's why we see so many introvert-extrovert couples (I'm an introvert happily married to an extrovert) and the most effective work teams have been found to be a mix of the two types. TED.com: Using our practical wisdom . The need for balance is especially important when it comes to creativity and productivity. When psychologists look at the lives of the most creative people, they almost always find a serious streak of introversion because solitude is a crucial ingredient for creativity. Charles Darwin took long walks alone in the woods and emphatically turned down dinner party invitations. Theodore Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss, dreamed up his creations in a private bell tower in the back of his house in La Jolla. Steve Wozniak invented the first Apple computer alone in his cubicle at Hewlett Packard. Of course, this doesn't mean that we should stop collaborating with each other -- witness Wozniak teaming up with Steve Jobs to form Apple. But it does mean that solitude matters. And for some people it's the air they breathe. In fact, we've known about the transcendent power of solitude for centuries; it's only recently that we've forgotten it. Our major religions all tell the story of seekers -- Moses, Jesus, Mohammed, Buddha -- who go off alone, to the wilderness, and bring profound revelations back to the community. No wilderness, no revelations. This is no surprise, if you listen to the insights of contemporary psychology. It turns out that you can't be in a group without instinctively mimicking others' opinions -- even about personal, visceral things like who you're physically attracted to. We ape other people's beliefs without even realizing we're doing it. Groups also tend to follow the most dominant person in the room even though there's zero correlation between good ideas and being a good talker. The best talker might have the best ideas, but she might not. So it's much better to send people off to generate ideas by themselves, freed from the distortion of group dynamics, and only then come together as a team. I'm not saying that social skills are unimportant, or that we should abolish teamwork. The same religions that send their sages off to lonely mountaintops also teach us love and trust. And the problems we face today in fields like economics and science are more complex than ever, and need armies of people to solve them. But I am saying that we all need alone time. And that the more freedom we give introverts to be themselves, the more they'll dream up their own unique solutions to the problems that bedevil us.","Susan Cain: Many of the world's great advances have been made by introverts .

"TV history will be made Sunday night with the premiere of ""Devious Maids,"" the first prime-time program featuring an all-Latina leading cast. But even before the first episode has aired, the Lifetime show is receiving a slew of criticism. Marc Cherry of ""Desperate Housewives'' is the creator and executive producer, and he's joined by two fellow ""Housewives"" alums: Sabrina Wind and Eva Longoria. The soapy comedy-drama is about five Latina maids who work for wealthy families and dream of a better life. The pilot opens with a Beverly Hills hostess scolding her maid: ""I think what you people do is heroic. You wash clothes you can't afford. You polish silver you will never dine with. You mop floors for people who don't bother to learn your name,"" finally ending with, ""That said, if you don't stop screwing my husband, I'm going to have you deported."" ""Devious Maids"" is loosely based on a Mexican telenovela ""Ellas son la Alegría del Hogar,"" and stars Judy Reyes (""Scrubs""), Dania Ramirez (""Premium Rush""), Ana Ortiz (""Ugly Betty"") and Roselyn Sanchez (""Chasing Papi""). Newcomer Edy Ganem plays Reyes' daughter. Recently, some in the Latino community have expressed their disappointment for the show, calling it a ""wasted opportunity"" in that it will only perpetuate the ongoing issue in Hollywood that Latinas can play only stereotypical roles such as maids, gardeners and nannies. ""It is not wrong to be a maid, or even a Latina maid,"" wrote Alisa Valdes-Rodriguez, author of ""The Dirty Girls Social Club,"" in an opinion piece, ""but there is something very wrong with an American entertainment industry that continually tells Latinas that this is all they are or can ever be."" Longoria responded to the backlash on The Huffington Post: ""I take pride in the fact that these characters are not one dimensional or limited to their job title. As the minority becomes the majority and the United States becomes more diverse, it is important that the protagonists on television embody this diversity."" ""However,"" she continued, ""television is a business. If we don't support shows that have diverse content, we won't see shows with diverse content! They will simply go away, and the hurdles to make the next show with diversity will be even more challenging."" Michelle Herrera Mulligan, editor in chief of Cosmopolitan for Latinas, countered: ""Well, Eva, I've watched the show, and I'm genuinely sad to say that I disagree. It's not a complex portrait; it's an insulting disgrace."" ""I saw the first [episode] and thought it was annoying,"" Valdes-Rodriguez said. ""I just don't like the flamenco guitar tone every time there's a Latina on the screen. It's very unimaginative and predictable. I have no interest in the show at all."" The National Hispanic Media Coalition is supporting the show, stating members of the coalition watched the pilot and saw nothing wrong. They said if Lifetime were depicting Latinas in negative stereotypical roles, the coaliton would be the first ones to criticize the show. ""Some of the issues that Latinos go through in this country is characterized by each of these maids, things they are trying to overcome,"" said Alex Nogales, executive director of the coalition, interview with CNN. ""If I came from a poor migrant experience, does that mean that story doesn't get told? That's silly."" Part of the criticism is the frustration that Hispanics don't have more characters on television that represent them as nurses, doctors and lawyers. Nogales says that to imagine Latinos being represented on-screen as successful professionals before telling the immigrant stories of hardship, assimilation and struggle first just won't work. Actress Ramirez said on a phone interview with CNN that Cherry has hired two Latina writers, Gloria Calderon and Tanya Saracho, ""to make sure that the Latino voices were really present and heard."" ""We have, as Latina maids, been portrayed on television and movies, but none of them have been humanized,"" she said. ""None of them are real life stories, choosing to take this role is more interesting to me because I get to tell a story of struggle."" For Ramirez, playing the role of Rosie Falta on the show strikes an emotional chord. Her character is a widow who left her son back in Mexico when her husband died and is working as a maid to help bring him to America. ""Not only do I tell this real compelling immigrant story, but I get to tap into my own experience because my parents had to leave me as an infant with my older sister, Danilda, back in the Dominican Republic and that took a lot of courage,"" Ramirez said. Ramirez's mother worked as a clothing factory worker but was a nurse back in the Dominican Republic, and her father was a taxi driver, although he was a chemist back in his home country. ""Now, I finally have a chance to portray the stories of the older generation,"" said Ramirez. ""If we are going to tackle Hollywood, then we need to educate Hollywood first. You gotta start there."" However, Valdes-Rodriguez says that people form their idea of reality by what they see on television. She used the racist comments about the boy from San Antonio who sang the national anthem at the NBA finals as an example of people ""who don't know anything about Latinos' different cultures."" ""I would advise those people to take a closer look at the people who attacked this boy ... where did they get the idea that we're all illegal immigrants? Well, the opening of the pilot episode of 'Devious Maids' has a boss threatening to deport one of the maids. Is this the only image Hollywood sees of us?"" Ramirez hopes audiences see that the leading ladies on ""Devious Maids"" as more than maids who are not defined by their jobs who happen to be Latina. Even though Ramirez has played every role from ""the hot girl"" to a superhero, she asks audiences, ""how is that better?""","For the first time on TV, there'll be a prime-time program featuring all Latina leads .

"Half of Americans believe Republican control of both chambers of Congress will be bad for the country, and a majority say it will in fact cause more gridlock in Washington, according to a new CNN/ORC nationwide poll. But the poll also shows the Republican Party's brand has improved over the past year, and they now are only slightly less popular than the Democratic Party. Democratic Party approval levels, meanwhile, have remained static. According to the survey, 50 percent of Americans believe the GOP taking control of the House and the Senate next year will be bad for America, and 52 percent expect it to lead to more gridlock. Another 37 percent, however, expect to see no difference in the levels of gridlock in Congress. But Americans seem to believe the GOP should be the ones to budge. Sixty-eight percent of Americans polled say the GOP isn't cooperating enough with President Barack Obama, while 57 percent say it's Obama who's not cooperating enough with the GOP. Democrats remain the more popular of the two parties — but not by much. Forty-four percent of Americans view the Democratic Party favorably, to the 50 percent who view it unfavorably. But Republicans have rebounded since October of 2013, increasing their favorability by 11 percent. Now, 41 percent of Americans view the Republican Party favorably, while 52 percent view it negatively. Obama remains underwater in the poll as well, with 48 percent of respondents viewing him favorably while 51 percent view him unfavorably. Obama's persistently low approval rating contributed to his party's resounding defeat this midterm election cycle, and the Republican Party regaining control of the Senate. Indeed, the CNN/ORC poll shows that a vast majority of Americans — 74 percent — saw the GOP's wins earlier this month as a repudiation of Democratic policies, far more than the 16 percent who saw it as a mandate for Republicans to pass their own. And there's one proposal in particular being floated by some Republicans that doesn't sit well with Americans — a potential government shutdown. Only 17 percent of Americans would see it as no problem at all if the government shut down for a few days. A fifth would see it as a crisis, and another 39 percent would see it as a major problem. A shutdown lasting weeks would be seen as even more dire for Americans. Thirty-nine percent would see such a shutdown as a crisis at that point, and another 38 percent would see it as a major problem. Some Republicans have suggested the party should attach a measure defunding implementation of the President's unilateral action on deportations to a must-pass spending bill as a way to respond to what they see as an unlawful abuse of executive power. Obama has indicated he'd veto any such approach, however, effectively shutting down the government. While some of the GOP proponents of such a tactic have argued the party could avoid responsibility for the shutdown, the CNN/ORC poll suggests that, regardless of the reason, Republicans would take the blame. Fifty percent of Americans say Republicans would be more responsible for a shutdown, while 33 percent would peg the blame on the president. The CNN/ORC poll was conducted among 1,045 adults via telephone from Nov. 21-23, and has a margin of error of 3 percentage points.","A new CNN/ORC poll finds 50 percent of Americans think GOP control of Congress will be bad for America .

"(CNN) -- As beer bottles flew and bonfires burned at the annual Pumpkin Fest in Keene, New Hampshire, over the weekend, those following the events online compared the ""riotous behavior"" near Keene State College to protests in Ferguson, Missouri. Their common refrain: a racist double standard in law enforcement response and media coverage that they attempted to mock using hashtags #PumpkinSpiceRiots and #Pumpkinfest, among others. 'Apples to oranges' Such comparisons are complicated, experts say, because Keene and Ferguson arose from different circumstances. Yes, law enforcement deployed tear gas and rubber bullets at both scenes, but otherwise, the two events are an ""apples to oranges comparison,"" said Donna Murch, associate professor of history at Rutgers University in New Jersey. Based on what we know about Keene, the mostly white riots appear to have stemmed from alcohol-fueled parties. Ferguson is an ongoing, organized movement prompted by the shooting death of an unarmed black teen, said Murch, whose research focuses around civil rights, social movements and policing. ""It demeans Ferguson and St. Louis to compare them to Pumpkin Fest,"" said Murch, who has spent time with protesters in Missouri. ""While the use of tear gas reflects how normative these militarized population control measures have become, Ferguson is a political movement, and looting (in Keene) is quite different from the civil disobedience we're seeing in Ferguson."" Sentiments about the militarization of law enforcement echoed throughout social media over the weekend, but they were largely overshadowed by racial discourse. That's where the conversation took a productive turn, Murch said: by shifting the discussion from comparisons between Ferguson and Keene to differences in how society perceives black and white behavior. ""That kind of comparison is really important because it's those attitudes that make state violence possible,"" Murch said. ""White youth are allowed to be children and have a sense of protection no matter how they behave, while black youth are criminalized by justice system. They're not allowed to have childhoods."" Perceptions of behavior . Those perceptions extend to riots, too, which most people tend to associate with the black community, said Victoria W. Wolcott, director of undergraduate studies at the University of Buffalo-New York and author of ""Race, Riots, and Roller Coasters: The Struggle Over Segregated Recreation in America."" ""Race riots"" tends to conjure memories of the Rodney King acquittal or 1967 Detroit, but those are anomalies, Wolcott said. Throughout history, white mobs have perpetrated the majority of racially motivated riots against the black community over integration in public and private life -- from the 1863 draft riots to the civil rights battles of the 1960s. ""It speaks to the notion that white violent behavior is not something talked about or stigmatized in the media or in mainstream society to extent that African-American rioting or looting behavior is,"" Wolcott said. Pumpkin Fest was a dramatic version of that because of initial characterizations of crowd behavior as rowdy: vandalization of cars and streets signs, fighting police and setting fires in the streets. White people frequently get ""rowdy"" at sporting events or music festivals, but that behavior is not associated with the white community on the whole in the same way that instances of looting or vandalization tend to be associated with the black community, she said. ""White behavior gets normalized,"" she said. ""In the African-American community, the long-term complaint is that the behavior of a small number of people stigmatizes the entire race or community. But you don't hear that same racialized language about small groups of white people that behave badly. They do not stigmatize the community in the same way."" Picking battles . Journalism professor Douglas M. McLeod of the University of Wisconsin-Madison agrees that comparing the nature of the two events is ""preposterous,"" seeing as Ferguson arose from ""enduring, longstanding"" issues related to race and inequality that keep the protests alive, unlike in Keene. But as far as media coverage goes, he sees the two as having more in common than others might believe. Both instances were framed as narratives in which the media strove to maintain neutrality by depicting facts on the ground -- what happened, who was there, how many arrests -- essentially, a story pitting police against the crowd instead of going deep into the themes and issues. ""When we do that, the underlying message is, here's a group that was creating chaos or disrupting order, and the response of police was to restore order,"" said McLeod, whose research focuses on the impact of media coverage in social conflicts. ""If there is justification for being upset about the coverage, it's the fact that the Ferguson situation was treated so much like the New Hampshire, not that they were treated differently. They were treated like they didn't have enduring issues or evidence to support their frustrations and claims."" He understands the history of discrimination and inequality that gives rise to frustrations when incidents like this occur. But ""If I were them, I'd pick their battles to focus on the bad coverage in Ferguson,"" he said. ""There are a lot of things to be concerned about in racial inequity and discrimination. This may not be the best example case to hold up.""","Experts say what happened in Keene was a riot; Ferguson is a political movement .
And yet Pumpkin Fest violence prompted important debate about racial perceptions ."
"A 4.1 magnitude earthquake struck Friday night in west-central South Carolina, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. The quake was the strongest to hit South Carolina since 2002, local emergency management officials said. The quake was centered 7 miles (12 kilometers) west-northwest of Edgefield, which is about 25 miles north of Augusta, Georgia, and 60 miles southwest of Columbia, South Carolina. The town of Edgefield has some 4,750 residents, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The USGS estimates the quake's depth was about 3 miles (4.6 kilometers). The same federal agency initially estimated a 4.4 magnitude quake. An emergency dispatcher in Edgefield said there were no reports of damage or injuries tied to the tremor. Columbia County, Georgia, and the South Carolina Emergency Management Division also reported no damage or injuries. Still, the quake was big enough to be felt as far away as metropolitan Atlanta some 160 miles west. The shaking stirred up a lot of instant reactions online in an area recently battered by a powerful winter storm. But unlike the snow and ice that just fell, the tenor of the tremor banter appeared to be light. ""Earthquake ... don't even think about canceling school,"" one tweeter from South Carolina wrote. ""My KIDS are going to school next week if they have to sit in parking lot."" Another Palmetto State resident was incredulous about the roller coaster Mother Nature has been on lately: ""So, South Carolina has had 70° weather, snow, and now an earthquake all in one week..."" As many as 20 quakes a year . Though it may seem rare, South Carolina does experience a number of earthquakes, officials said. But most of them are minor. Friday's quake was actually the 13th earthquake in South Carolina in the past 12 months, the South Carolina Emergency Management Division said. The state usually experiences 15 to 20 earthquakes a year, the agency said. In November, 2002, a magnitude 4.4 earthquake hit near Charleston. Friday's quake is the strongest one since that quake, the agency said.","The quake was centered near Edgefield, South Carolina, not far from Augusta, Georgia .

"Sharon Edwards of Salem, Oregon, may have to move to Mexico, where the cost of living is cheaper, so she can afford her retirement. She was always good about saving, but because of forced retirement at 62, the self-employed interpreter is now limited to a $500 monthly budget. Her finances are determined by Social Security, savings and the cost of treating a chronic lung disease. She worries about meeting her basic needs during her later years and thinks about selling her house to finance her expenses. ""When I budgeted for life as a single woman, I didn't budget for 3% inflation, the loss of half of my retirement savings in the market crash, my hearing loss or early retirement,"" she said. Almost daily, we hear stories of the crisis stemming from the breakdown of the three-legged stool of retirement: traditional pensions, Social Security and individual savings. For the majority of Americans, one of the legs of the stool is already gone -- traditional pensions. With its replacement, the 401(k), the stool is in danger of tipping retirees into poverty. Recent research finds 401(k)-style defined contribution plans have lost their shine. IRAs and 401(k) plans lost a combined $2.8 trillion, or 47% of their value, between September 2007 and December 2008, the height of the economic recession. Retirement experts find that these plans have numerous shortcomings, including high operation costs and low investment returns. The biggest problem with defined contribution plans is that alone they do not provide retirees with guaranteed retirement income. If employees don't make the right large contributions into the right investment mix at the right time, they are at high risk for poverty during retirement. This risk continues to spread as the job of planning and managing retirement savings continues to be transferred to workers who have to learn in their spare time to do what professional money managers are trained and paid to do full-time. The switch from traditional pensions to defined contribution plans in the private sector also challenges workers to determine their own life expectancy as they manage their savings plan. Edwards may live to 70 or she may live to 95, but she has to manage her retirement savings as if she'll live to 95, or else longer-than-average life expectancy could cause her to run out of money. This means both that she needed to save more, and invest much more conservatively, than if she had a traditional pension. If workers continue to be forced to play the dual role of employee and retirement actuary, stories of older workers like Edwards will not change for the better. We must work to improve and expand retirement options. We need to explore new innovative retirement models that provide guaranteed retirement income for all workers if we are going to be a country where once again working people can reasonably expect to be able to retire. This year, California State Sen. Kevin De León and Darrell Steinberg, the Senate president pro tempore, made headlines for introducing legislation that would allow private-sector workers to enroll in a modest, state-operated retirement program. A similar proposal has been championed by New York City Comptroller John Liu. The plan, based on a new retirement model created by New School economics professor Teresa Ghilarducci, would pool employee and employer contributions into a professionally managed, citywide retirement fund. Although the future of these proposals is uncertain, they are a step in the right direction. Traditional pensions usually outperform their counterparts because they are managed professionally, and because they can use the average life expectancy of their participants for their investment time horizon. We should look at what has worked well with traditional pensions, which keep nearly 5 million older Americans out of poverty, and use those attributes to reach more retirees. After all, shouldn't retirement stories come with happy endings? Part of what we aspire to as Americans is being able to stop working with our dreams and reasonable expectations of retirement still intact. What does it say about the American dream if Sharon Edwards can't continue to afford her home or actually has to move to another country to retire?","Yvonne Walker: 401(k)-style plans create danger of tipping retirees into poverty .

"(CNN) -- It met the definition of a major one, but the magnitude-7.2 earthquake that struck Friday in southern Mexico's Guerrero state didn't land the kind of punch that it might have. ""There was no way not to feel it,"" Gustavo Lozano told CNN about the temblor, which struck at 9:27 a.m. (10:27 a.m. ET) and was centered 22 miles (36 kilometers) north-northwest of Tecpan. He was with his family at their home in Barra de Potosi, a fishing village nearly a three-hour drive northwest of Tecpan, when the earthquake hit. ""It was extremely strong."" Afraid of a possible tsunami, and unaware that no advisory had been issued for one, he and his family drove to a shelter at the Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo International Airport, where dozens of other people also were gathering. En route, they noticed a few walls from older buildings had collapsed, but nothing worse. Once there, they concluded they needn't have bothered taking shelter. ""It seems like the worst has already happened,"" he said. The quake's depth at the epicenter was a shallow 15 miles (24 kilometers), the U.S. Geological Survey said. The Mexican National Seismological Service measured its depth at 6 miles (10 kilometers) and its magnitude as 7.0. USGS classifies any quake magnitude 7.0 to 7.9 as ""major,"" and any at 8.0 or more as ""great."" The earthquake's timing and location could have proved devastating -- it occurred on the Pacific coast between major resort towns of Acapulco and Zihuatanejo during Holy Week, when Mexicans traditionally flock to the beaches, and resorts typically run at full capacity. Its impact was also felt in Mexico City, 170 miles (273 kilometers) northeast of the epicenter. ""I was working in my radio news program ... and we were talking about (author) Gabriel GarcÃ­a Marquez's death, when I started to feel how the ground was shaking and the lamps were moving,"" journalist Sol Rivera said via e-mail. She urged her listeners to remain calm and to move to a safe space. Reporters soon called to inform her that everything was OK. At least one building in the capital was damaged, but there were no reports of major damage, Mexico City Mayor Miguel Angel Mancera told CNN affiliate FOROtv. The city's secretary of civil protection, Fausto Lugo, said electricity failed in some areas and that some people reported being trapped inside elevators, but that there were no reports of injuries. Tecpan is 54 miles (87 kilometers) northwest of Acapulco, where the city's civil protection office said via Twitter that basic services were operating without reports of damage. Seated on top of three tectonic plates, Mexico is in one of the most seismically active parts of the world.

"""UglyGorilla,"" ""KandyGoo,"" and ""WinXYHappy"" are some of the aliases used by the Chinese accused of hacking U.S. companies on Monday. The men behind these handles are officers of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) under a unit known simply by the code 61398. Little is confirmed about the mysterious unit 61398, a section that the Chinese authorities have not officially acknowledged. The Chinese defense ministry said the country's military ""has never supported any hacker activities."" But the U.S. indictment notice pinpoints a non-descript building on Datong Road in Shanghai's Pudong District as one of the locations for unit 61398's alleged cyber espionage activities. When CNN tried to visit the building last year, our correspondents were chased away by security guards, as seen in the video above. What is unit 61398 and what do they do? U.S.-based Internet security firm Mandiant released a 60-page report last year detailing allegations against the shadowy unit over a six-year period. According to Mandiant's document and the U.S. indictment, here's what we know about the secret division. Capable . Mandiant says unit 61398 is also known as the ""comment crew,"" and has systematically stolen hundreds of terabytes of data from at least 141 organizations across 20 industries worldwide since as early as 2006. Large . Mandiant estimates that more than 1,000 servers are being used by unit 61398. The security firm believes the unit employs anywhere from hundreds to thousands of staff. A look at the physical size of the building in Shanghai -- 12 floors high, with more than 130,000 square feet of space -- suggests the unit could house around 2,000 people. Focused . Mandiant observed 141 companies targeted by unit 61398, out of which 115 were in the United States. These were blue-chip companies in important industries such as aerospace, satellite and telecommunications, and information technology -- strategic industries that were identified in China's five year plan for 2011 to 2015. ""It's really a who's who of American companies,"" says Grady Summers, Mandiant's vice president. Some of the alleged victims included in the latest indictment are U.S. Steel Corp., Westinghouse, Alcoa, Allegheny Technologies, the United Steel Workers Union and SolarWorld. Well-supported . Unit 61398 was given a special fiber optic communication infrastructure by state-owned enterprise China Telecom in the name of national defense, Mandiant reported. Tricky . The accused Chinese hackers reportedly use spear-phishing to hack into companies. The simple trick makes scam emails appear like they are from someone the receiver actually knows. For example, the emails would be personally addressed and signed by another employee in the same company. Spear-phishers may scan social media to find out personal details about a victim to make the scam emails seem legitimate. Tip of the iceberg .

"With domestic labor costs rising, many Asian manufacturing producers are now looking to relocate their factories in other regions of the world. Could Africa replace Asia and/or China as the world's next manufacturing hub? To be sure, Africa has a number of manufacturing advantages that it has yet to realize. Besides low labor costs and abundant resources, these include duty-free and quota-free access to U.S. and EU markets for light manufactures under the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act and the Cotonou Agreement. Is this enough to offset Sub-Saharan Africa's generally low labor productivity relative to that of its Asian competitors? Yes, if Africa can implement appropriate supportive policies to leverage its opportunities soon. This is the finding from a recent book by a team of World Bank economists. China dominates the global export market in light manufacturing, and its competitive edge far exceeds that of low income exporters that recently entered the global market. But steeply rising costs of land, regulatory compliance, and especially labor in China's coastal export manufacturing centers have begun to erode the latter's cost advantage, a trend likely to accelerate in the coming years. The ongoing redistribution of cost advantages in labor-intensive manufacturing presents an opportunity for Sub-Saharan Africa to start producing many light manufactures, enhance private investment and create millions of jobs. Read more: Brazil competes with China, India to invest in Africa . According to new evidence, feasible, low-cost, sharply focused policy initiatives aimed at enhancing private investment could launch the region on a path to becoming competitive in light manufacturing. These initiatives would complement progress on broader investment reforms and could foster industrialization and raise the market share of domestically produced goods in rapidly growing local markets for light manufacturers. And as local producers scale up, product will improve, and experience with technology, management and marketing will accumulate, allowing them to seize emerging export opportunities. In Sub-Saharan Africa, as in China and Vietnam, policies that encourage foreign direct investment can speed up industrial development and export expansion. Isolated successes can be multiplied, as with Ethiopia's recent foray into selling cut flowers in EU markets: a single pioneering firm opened the door to an industry that now employs 50,000 workers. Previous studies identified long lists of constraints, including corruption, red tape, inadequate utilities, poor transport and skills, inadequate access to finance, and so on. In contrast, the book proposes smaller, more specific, and sometimes newly identified constraints. Narrowing the analysis can make the reform agenda more manageable within the financial and human resource constraints of most African countries. Take the leather industry in Ethiopia. This sector employs about 8,000 workers and exported about $8 million in 2010, a fraction of similar countries in Asia such as Vietnam. Ethiopia's labor costs are lower than Asia's and the country has Africa's second largest cattle population, next to Sudan. Read more: Why Asian giants scent opportunity in Africa . Furthermore, climatic conditions mean Ethiopian animal skin is among the best in the world. Yet the most binding constraint is the shortage of quality processed leather due to poor disease control, lack of quality processing of raw hides and restrictive trade policies on processed leather. Once the problems are identified, the proposed solutions are straightforward. Treat ectoparasites (the skin disease that causes blemishes) at modest cost; allow imports and exports of raw hides and processed leather to help alleviate this constraint; and provide technical assistance. Some of these measures require changing existing policies. Others require provision of public goods such as industrial parks that could be inexpensive. Ethiopia's comparative advantage in wages, productivity, and natural resources has led the Huajian Group, a Chinese shoe maker, to build a factory in Ethiopia in three months, with two production lines starting in January 2012, exporting 20,000 pairs of shoes a month and creating some 550 jobs. So the opportunities and the preconditions are certainly there, provided African policy makers speedily seize them, as the book notes. But will Africa be the world's next manufacturing hub? Not likely. Manufacturing can be an unprecedented opportunity for Africa to industrialize and provide productive jobs to millions of Africans, especially young people who make up as much as 36% of the total working-age population; three in five of Africa's unemployed are under the age of 25. Read more: Is the West losing out to China in Africa? But the emergence of China as a powerhouse producing a variety of manufacturing goods at very cheap prices thanks to the large scale and skilful exploitation of the supply chain means that not all manufacturing jobs will be transferred from China to Africa. Due to widely varying country conditions, some African economies can take advantage of favorable wages and natural resources and benefit from taking timely measures to develop and export manufacturing goods. But large-scale production requirements also mean that some jobs will be transferred to countries such as India, Bangladesh, Cambodia and Vietnam while others will move to China's interior. In short, the invisible hand of globalization will work to ensure a redistribution of cost advantages to the benefit of the ultimate consumers around the world.","Low labor costs and abundant resources are some of Africa's manufacturing advantages .

"Rivers fed by torrential mountain rains spilled across the prairies of southern Alberta, Canada, Friday, leaving two people dead and covering downtown Calgary in brown floodwater. The two victims were caught up in the river that runs through the town of High River, about 40 miles south of Calgary, said Sgt. Josee Valiquette of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The two people have not been identified; a third person, a woman, remains missing. High River is one of several communities where residents have been evacuated because of the flooding. Red Deer, 90 miles north of Calgary, and Lethbridge, about 130 miles to the south of the city, also have evacuations in place. About 10,000 people in Medicine Hat, in southeastern Alberta, were being evacuated Friday ahead of the expected cresting of the South Saskatchewan River on Saturday, city spokeswoman Brandy Calvert said. That's about one-sixth of the city's 62,000 residents, she said. Officials expect Saturday's flood to surpass the one they had in 1995, which was the biggest on record, Calvert said. In Calgary, Mayor Naheed Nenshi said the Bow and Elbow rivers were carrying as much three times as much water through Calgary as they did during the city's monstrous 2005 flood, which obliterated roads, chased residents from their homes and drowned livestock on the way to causing more than $400 million in damages. ""The Bow River looks like an ocean at the moment,"" he said. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper toured affected areas by helicopter Friday afternoon along with Alberta Premier Alison Redford and Nenshi. ""Difficult day seeing so much devastation in southern Alberta, but encouraged by resilient spirit of so many Albertans,"" Redford tweeted. She said Harper pledged federal support. Redford gave her condolences to the families of the flood victims and urged Albertans in flood-affected areas to stay safe. In Calgary, the 17,000-seat Saddledome -- home to the NHL Calgary Flames -- was flooded, along with parts of Calgary Zoo and the Calgary Stampede grounds, where the famous annual Calgary Stampede rodeo is scheduled to take place in less than two weeks. At the zoo, on the bank of the Bow River, staff moved the potbellied pigs and zebras to a safe location off site. The zoo said the other animals were moved to higher ground. As of Friday night, 25 neighborhoods in Calgary including most of downtown, were evacuated. They were also without power after the city ordered ENMAX, the energy utility, to shut it off in evacuated areas. Clean water continued to flow to homes, but the city asked residents to limit their use as much as possible. Residents in Calgary seemed alternately shocked by the flooding and willing to take it in stride. ""I don't think anybody's ever seen water flow through the streets,"" Calgary resident Rylan Broadbent told CNN Friday after evacuating his apartment building in the Erlton neighborhood, next to the overflowing Elbow River. Others were more melancholy about the scope of the flooding, which forced more than 75,000 residents out of their homes and left the heart of the city largely deserted. ""We're not out of the woods yet,"" Neala Barton, the spokeswoman for the Alberta government, told CNN. Some shelters in the city were filled to capacity, Calgary officials said Friday. Schools were closed. Officials said most of the city's many bridges were holding against the water, but at least one was under water and another had washed out. Still, the city's director of roads reassured residents the bridges are safe. ""The piers, the abutments on either side of the bridges, are right down to bedrock. What that means is what they are standing on is absolutely tied to the ground,"" Ryan Jestin said in a video posted on the city's website, standing in the rain overlooking the flooded Bow River downtown. Meanwhile, Calgary police said they were patrolling evacuated areas to ensure that vacant homes and businesses would remain as safe as possible. See also: Colorado's devastating Black Forest Fire 100% contained . Authorities declared a state of emergency in several cities, including the mountain town of Canmore, where on Thursday, raging water tore out a portion of the Trans-Canada Highway. Rescue crews used heavy construction equipment to rescue people from homes and businesses Thursday in High River, the network reported. Canada's military was pitching in with helicopters and other assets to help local officials with rescue and evacuation efforts, Prime Minister Stephen Harper said. See also: Survivors of India floods recount horror . The flooding was caused by a slow-moving storm that dumped 154 millimeters (more than 6 inches) of rain on the region from Wednesday to Thursday, CNN meteorologist Sherri Pugh said. As much as another inch of rain, about 25 millimeters, is possible northwest of Calgary on Friday, and yet another front is expected Monday, bringing the threat of more rain. Calgary, near the Canadian Rocky Mountains, is perhaps best known for its rodeo, held each July. More than 1.4 million people attended last year, organizers say. This year's Stampede events are due to begin in 13 days. It was unclear if the flooding would affect the event, but organizers did say on their website that other events scheduled at the park where the Stampede is held have been canceled through Sunday. Calgary authorities are using the park as a staging area for flood response efforts. Survival kit: supplies for weathering a disaster .","A third person is missing in the floods, the RCMP says .

"Equipment failure and human error likely caused propane tank cylinders to explode at a central Florida refilling plant late Monday, a fire official said Tuesday. The blasts at the Blue Rhino plant in Tavares injured eight plant workers, said John Herrell of the Lake County Sheriff's Office. The situation is now contained and an evacuation order issued overnight has been lifted, the Florida Division of Emergency Management said in a news release. Residents nearby saw a pulsating glow in the sky. One Tavares resident, Norma Haygood, told CNN affiliate WESH it felt like ""bombs going off."" The fire was out by 2 a.m., three hours after the explosions began, and authorities are investigating the cause, according to Tavares Fire Chief Richard Keith. Keith, who lives a few miles away from the fire, said he ""knew it was bad right off the bat."" ""It truly sounded like a car hit our house,"" he said. There had been earlier reports of 15 missing workers, but all 15 were found safe, Keith said. Some had fled the scene; some drove themselves to hospitals. No residents were hurt, authorities said. Texas fertilizer plant fell through 'patchwork' of safety rules . There were 53,000 20-pound cylinders of propane at the facility -- more than a million pounds in all, Herrell said. Firefighters immediately set up a half-mile evacuation area around the plant. The nearest homes -- about 50 of them -- are about three-quarters of a mile away, Herrell said. And they began pouring water onto the facility. Trucks parked at the plant went up in fireballs as the cylinders they were carrying exploded. The nighttime sky flickered in hues of orange. ""You could see the explosions from across the lake,"" said Ashley McCormick, a resident in nearby Mount Dora. ""They were very intense."" 1 killed, 8 injured in blast at Louisiana chemical plant . There were 24 employees at work at the time of the blasts, according to Scott Brockelmeyer, a spokesman for Ferrellgas, the parent company of Blue Rhino. He said the company is cooperating with investigators. The incident was ""as sobering as you can possibly imagine,"" he told CNN. ""We're sending good vibes their way from all over the country."" The employees perform such tasks as refurbishing cylinders and loading them on pallets and vehicles. There were some management personnel on site as well, the spokesman said. Brockelmeyer confirmed that several employees were injured and had been taken to hospitals. The plant produces 2.3 million tanks annually, and serves all of Florida, southern Georgia and southern Alabama, he said. It opened in 2004. Brockelmeyer would not speculate on the cause of the explosion and declined to comment on the fire chief's statement that equipment failure and human error likely caused the incident. ""The fact that there are no fatalities is a blessing,"" said John Drury, the city administrator of Tavares, a community of some 14,000 people about 30 miles northwest of Orlando. ""This was a big deal, and a lot of people responded quickly."" Now, the focus shifts to what caused the blasts. The Blue Rhino facility refills propane tanks used in gas grills. The company's tank exchange service allows customers to trade in an empty tank for a full one at retail locations. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined Blue Rhino in 2011 over a ""serious"" safety violation involving tools and equipment. It is not clear whether safety violations had anything to do with the fire. According to Brockelmeyer, the 2011 OSHA violation was due to an air nozzle at the facility that had a missing component. He did not give CNN any further information about the component or what it does.

"MINDEN, Nevada (CNN) -- Fellow aviation enthusiast Sir Richard Branson said Wednesday he was worried that rescuers had found no sign of his friend, adventurer Steve Fossett, who disappeared two days ago after taking off from another friend's desert ranch. Fossett poses after accepting his induction into the National Aviation Hall of Fame on July 20, 2007. However, the billionaire president of Virgin Atlantic also was optimistic that Fossett -- whom he calls ""a tough old boot"" -- will surface soon. ""If he's landed and he's not too badly hurt, he's the one person in the world who will be mentally and physically equipped to get out of it,"" Branson said. Rescuers began looking again Wednesday for Fossett. Search organizers at the Minden-Tahoe Airport, just south of Carson City, Nevada, said they expect the wind will not hamper search efforts, as it did Tuesday.  See a map of the area » . ""The winds have cooperated much more today, so that will allow the helicopters -- the three being dispatched out here today -- to fly much closer to the ground to get a better look at what's going on,"" said 1st Sgt. Chuck Allen, spokesman for the Nevada Department of Public Safety. Five planes being used in the search will be able to cruise at about 1,000 feet, the spokesman said. The California and Utah wings of the Civil Air Patrol joined the search Wednesday, said Maj. Cynthia Ryan of the Nevada Civil Air Patrol. She is leading the rescue effort. One of the search planes is equipped with ARCHER, a modified version of the Navy's hyperspectral imaging technology. To use it, search-and-rescue personnel input such information as the shape, size and color of what they are looking for, and imaging equipment compares those parameters with what it sees on the ground. ""It can see as little as 10 percent of the target and extrapolate from there,"" Ryan said. Helicopters or ground searchers can follow up on anything of possible significance, she added. Though there were no signs of Fossett on Tuesday evening, searchers and friends remained optimistic that the eclectic adventurer was safe. ""We're confident if his plane only sustained minor damage that he's strong enough to survive the elements,"" Allen said. Fossett, 63, was in a single-engine Bellanca Super Decathlon when he took off at 9 a.m. (noon ET) Monday in good flying conditions from hotel magnate Barron Hilton's Flying M Ranch in Nevada, Ryan said. A world-record-holding pilot, yachtsman and balloonist, Fossett is an accomplished sportsman who knows how to handle himself in the wild. In addition to skippering flights and voyages around the globe, Fossett has competed in cross-country skiing competitions, the Iditarod Sled Dog Race and the Ironman Triathlon. He also swam the English Channel and ran in the Leadville Trail Run, a 100-mile foot race through the Colorado Rockies. He has prevailed in the past after experiencing complications during a flight, once walking 30 miles for help after making a forced landing, Ryan said. Branson -- whose Virgin Atlantic company has sponsored some of Fossett's attempts to shatter world flight records -- said Tuesday that Fossett's track record suggests ""we'll get some good news soon.""  Watch as Fossett's plane is described » . ""Steve is a tough old boot. I suspect he is waiting by his plane right now for someone to pick him up,"" Branson said in a written statement. ""The ranch he took off from covers a huge area, and Steve has had far tougher challenges to overcome in the past."" Branson struck a more cautious tone Wednesday, saying he was ""obviously worried"" that Fossett may be injured because he was wearing a watch capable of emitting an emergency distress signal. If Fossett were OK, Branson surmised, he would have been able to activate the manually operated signal. However, he added, ""If anyone's going to end up walking back up [to] the ranch and apologizing for pranging the Hiltons' plane, it's likely to be Steve Fossett."" Though Ryan was optimistic that Fossett will be located, she noted the challenges facing the rescue mission -- namely a 600-square-mile swath of desert, covered with sagebrush and deep ravines, and swept by tricky wind conditions that confounded Tuesday's aerial search. ""It's a very large haystack,"" she said. ""And an airplane is a very small needle. No doubt about that."" Fossett was supposed to return to the Hilton ranch, about 30 miles south of Yerington, Nevada, at noon (3 p.m. ET) Monday. The search began six hours later, Ryan said. Fossett did not file a flight plan, but one is not required on flights using visual navigation. When he left, he had four to five hours of fuel for flight, Ryan said. ""Steve took off toward the south and was going to fly southbound, looking around for some dry lake beds for some plans he had for the future,"" Ryan said. Those plans, she said, involved testing a vehicle in an attempt to set a world land speed record. Fossett was in Sparks, Nevada, last month preparing a jet racer to break the land speed record at Bonneville Flats in northwest Utah. Ryan said Tuesday that authorities were analyzing information from radar intelligence to track Fossett. There has been no sound detected from the plane's emergency locator radio beacon, which goes off if there is a hard impact. In 2005, Fossett piloted the first nonstop, solo flight around the world without refueling. Virgin Atlantic sponsored the plane, the GlobalFlyer, which Fossett used a year later to break the world's flight distance record, traveling almost 26,000 miles in 76 hours and 43 minutes from Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, to Bournemouth, England. He made an emergency landing during that flight after electricity on the aircraft failed over Shannon, Ireland. His goal had been to land at Kent International Airport in Manston, England. In 2002, he achieved the first solo balloon flight around the world, traveling 20,626 miles in 14 days. He's credited with 115 world records or world firsts, and holds official world records in five sports, according to his Web site. In a interview with CNN last year, Fossett said his favorite record-breaking feat was the 2002 solo balloon flight. ""We had to really upgrade the technical capability of balloons, and the flight was much more difficult than I'd ever imagined it would be. I tried six times over the course of six years before succeeding,"" he said.  See Fossett's adventures via land, sea and air » . Asked how long he'll keep going, Fossett answered, ""I imagine that when I'm 80 years old and sitting in a wheelchair that I might do something like take a remote control airplane and try and fly it around the world. I plan to be setting and breaking records indefinitely."" Fossett was born in Jackson, Tennessee, and grew up in California, where he attended Stanford University, graduating with a degree in economics in 1966. After earning an MBA at Washington University in St. Louis, he became a commodities broker and launched in 1980 the Chicago-based securities company Lakota Trading, the income from which he used to fund his adventures. He and his wife of almost four decades, Peggy Viehland, have no children. E-mail to a friend .","Searchers say weather will let 5 planes, 3 choppers ""get a better look""

"The surviving suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings suffered an injury to his throat and may not be able to talk, a federal official told CNN on Saturday, possibly hindering attempts by authorities to question him about a  motive in the attack. With one suspect dead, authorities believe answers to a motive and whether the brothers had help rest with Dzhokar Tsarnaev, who was captured Friday night just minutes after authorities had indicated that a massive manhunt for the suspect appeared to come up empty. The official, who was briefed on Tsarnaev's condition, spoke on condition of anonymity. Tsarnaev was in ""serious but stable condition"" and ""not yet able to communicate yet,"" Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick told reporters during an impromptu briefing on Saturday. Federal prosecutors are at the heavily guarded Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where Tsarnaev is being treated for wounds. Authorities have not publicly detailed the injuries sustained by the teen, but an official who has been briefed said Tsarnaev has been ""intubated and sedated."" The official also spoke on condition of anonymity. ""I, and I think all of the law enforcement professionals, are hoping for a host of reasons that the suspect survives, because we have a million questions, and those questions need to be answered. There are parts of the investigation, in terms of information and evidence, that still needs to be run to ground,"" Patrick said. Authorities have not said whether they have questioned Tsarnaev, nor have they publicly said what charges will be filed against the teen. But a Justice Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told CNN the teen will face federal terrorism charges and possibly state murder charges. The government has invoked the public safety exception, a designation that allows investigators to question the teen without reading him his Miranda rights and without a lawyer present, another Justice Department official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, told CNN. Tsarnaev, 19, and his older brother, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, are accused of setting off two bombs near the finish line of the Boston Marathon on Monday, killing three people and leaving more than 170 wounded. The arrest of Tsarnaev brought to an end a manhunt that paralyzed Cambridge, Watertown and Boston as authorities searched door to door for a suspect not only believed to be behind the bombings, but who they feared also could unleash more explosives. Acting alone? So far, evidence suggests that the two brothers acted alone in the bombings and subsequent shootout, Watertown Police Chief Edward Deveau said. ""From what I know right now, these two acted together and alone,"" Deveau told CNN on Saturday.  ""I think we have to be ever vigilant, and we're learning as we go along, but as far as this little cell -- this little group -- I think we got our guys."" Even so, questions remain. ""Why did these young men who grew up and studied here as part of our communities and our country resort to such violence? How did they plan and carry out these attacks? And did they receive any help? The families of those killed so senselessly deserve answers,"" President Barack Obama said Friday in a televised address. 24 hours of chaos . Shortly after the FBI released photos of the suspects Thursday night, Tsarnaev and his older brother led authorities on a wild car chase and shootout. Officials say the brothers, for no obvious reason, killed Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer Sean Collier while he was sitting in his car. The Tsarnaevs then hijacked a Mercedes, telling the driver they were the marathon bombers, and hurled explosives at the pursuing officers, authorities said. ""There was an exchange of over 200 rounds of gunfire, there were improvised explosive devices, and handmade hand grenades thrown at the officers at the scene,"" Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis said. Tamerlan Tsarnaev ran out of ammunition during the shootout and was tackled by officers. That's when the younger Tsarnaev drove the Mercedes toward the officers and his brother. ""They dive out of the way, and he (the younger brother) drives over his brother and drags him a short distance down the street,"" Deveau said. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was later pronounced dead at the hospital. He was wearing explosives and a triggering device when he died, a source briefed on the investigation told CNN. The FBI, while executing a search warrant at a residence believed to have been affiliated with Tsarnaev, took three people into custody for questioning Friday. It was unclear Saturday what information the FBI was seeking and whether the three were released. 'Pool of blood' The dramatic end to the manhunt came when a Watertown man, cooped up in his house all day because of a ""shelter in place"" order, finally stepped outside when the order was lifted. David Henneberry soon noticed the tarp covering the boat in his backyard was flapping in the wind and a retention strap was cut. He also noticed a small amount of blood on the tarp. ""He basically stuck his head under the tarp, noticed a pool of blood,"" Henneberry's stepson Robert Duffy told CNN. Henneberry called 911, Duffy said. Authorities arrived and evacuated Duffy's stepfather. Using a bullhorn, they called out to the suspect: ""Come out with your hands up."" The man refused. ""We used a robot to pull the tarp off the boat,"" David Procopio of the Massachusetts State Police said. ""We were also watching him with a thermal imaging camera in our helicopter. He was weakened by blood loss -- injured last night, most likely."" A gunfight ensued, with more than 20 rounds fired. Authorities eventually rushed the boat and took the teen into custody. Cheers and mourning . As word of the arrest spread, hundreds of residents swarmed the streets of Watertown and Boston, surrounding police cars and cheering them on. But the celebrations were tempered by the deaths of four people this week, all allegedly by the hands of the Tsarnaev brothers. Three spectators were killed in the marathon bombings, and Collier, the MIT police officer, was fatally shot early Friday. At least 57 people remained hospitalized Saturday afternoon, including three in critical condition, according to a CNN count. On Saturday night as Collier's body was driven from the morgue to a funeral home, Boston-area police officers and firefighters lined the route to pay respect to their slain colleague. Mistaken identity adds to family's grief over Boston victim . The family of 8-year-old Martin Richard, who was killed in the bombings, issued a statement thanking the authorities and members of the public who helped track down the two suspects. ""None of this will bring our beloved Martin back, or reverse the injuries these men inflicted on our family and nearly two hundred others,"" the Richard family said. ""We continue to pray for healing and for comfort on the long road that lies ahead for every victim and their loved ones."" Chinese student killed in bombings had followed her passion to Boston . 'Boston Stands as One' Boston sports teams Saturday honored victims of the attacks. The Boston Red Sox planned a special pre-game ceremony at their Saturday game against the Kansas City Royals, which was played amid heightened security at Fenway Park. Their Friday night game against the Royals was postponed because of the city lockdown and will be played Sunday, the team said. The Boston Bruins hockey game against the Pittsburgh Penguins, originally scheduled for Friday night, was rescheduled for Saturday afternoon. The Bruins and Penguins, along with the Red Sox, all plan to auction their Saturday jerseys to support the bombing victims. Limited-edition T-shirts reading ""Boston Stands as One"" are being sold by the Boston Celtics to support the victims. Players planned to wear some of the shirts while warming up for Saturday's game, the team said. 'Seek forgiveness' What's next for the Boston Marathon bombing suspect? The Tsarnaevs' uncle Ruslan Tsarni said their alleged actions were abhorrent. ""You put a shame on our entire family -- the Tsarnaev family -- and you put a shame on the entire Chechen ethnicity,"" Tsarni said. Tsarni promised Saturday to help his nephew seek forgiveness from the bombing victims and advised him to tell police everything he knows. The brothers come from a family originally from the Russian republic of Chechnya and fled the brutal wars there in the 1990s. It's unknown how their Chechen roots may have influenced their alleged actions. Tsarni said he believes Tamerlan Tsarnaev influenced his younger brother. FBI agents interviewed the elder Tsarnaev in 2011 at the request of a foreign government that suspected he had ties to extremist groups, the FBI said. It declined to name the government, but a senior U.S. official told CNN on Saturday that it was Russia that made the request of the United States. The request was based on information that Tamerlan Tsarnaev was a follower of radical Islam, the FBI said, adding it found no evidence of terrorism activity. ""I think unless we see some horrible dropping of the ball, I don't think this is an intelligence failure,"" said former CIA operative Robert Baer. ""In retrospect, it might look like one, but I don't think it is."" The suspects' father, who lives in the Russian republic of Dagestan, told CNN on Saturday that he believes his sons were ""never, ever"" involved in the Boston attacks. He also said he plans to go to the United States, though he didn't say when.","Dzhokar Tsarnaev is ""intubated and sedated,"" an official says .

"""I think, when the moment finally comes, I'll probably have mixed feelings about it,"" Dick Cole said. ""It will be like coming to the last page of a book you don't want to end. The book has been a good one, but you're sad that it's over."" He is 98 years old. He was part of a military unit whose valor is written indelibly on the pages of this nation's history. The Doolittle Raiders flew their ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo"" mission in April 1942, when, in the wake of Pearl Harbor, spirits in the United States were at a low point. The 80 Raiders, flying 16 bombers under the command of Jimmy Doolittle, showed the world that America would never give up. ""We had planned on waiting until there were only two of us left to open the bottle and have our final toast,"" Cole said.  ""But we don't want to wait any longer. As fragile as most of us are, it's time."" So, on Saturday, at the National Museum of the United States Air Force on Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, the few Raiders who still are alive will open the bottle of 1896 Hennessy Very Special cognac -- 1896 was the year of Jimmy Doolittle's birth -- and raise a solemn toast to their crewmates who have died. ""All 80 of us knew each other, from all our training missions,"" Cole said. ""I can still close my eyes and see their faces, hear their voices. We were a pretty good team."" Pretty good? They were the finest and bravest warriors this nation had to offer. Cole was Doolittle's co-pilot in the first of the 16 planes to take off from the deck of the USS Hornet in the Pacific. ""We knew that we had just separated ourselves from civilization,"" he said. ""There were no long-range radios in the planes. And, of course, there was no turning back."" There was a time when every schoolchild in the U.S. was taught about the courage of the Raiders. It was a true-life story the country knew by heart: . The U.S., after Pearl Harbor, was in terrible trouble in the Pacific. Launching a counterattack on Japan seemed impossible, because there were no U.S. airfields close enough. And then came the Doolittle Raiders, 80 volunteers with guts enough to thrill their countrymen. They would fly 16 specially modified B-25s from the deck of the Hornet. Launching heavy bombers from a carrier had never been tried; returning to the ship was not an option. The plan was to hit Tokyo, then hope to make it safely to China. But when there were reports on the day of the raid that Japan had learned of the mission, a decision was made: The planes had to take off from much farther out in the Pacific than had been anticipated. From that distance there was not enough fuel to get them to safety. And those men took off anyway. ""I was scared, frightened -- just about any word you can think of that describes being apprehensive,"" Cole said. ""But I knew I was flying with the best pilot in the world."" Doolittle's men hit Tokyo, then flew as far as they could. Eleven crews had to bail out; four crews crash-landed and one plane made it to Russia. Two Raiders died as they bailed out. Eight were captured by the Japanese; three of them were executed, and five were sentenced to life in prison. One died of starvation; the others were grievously mistreated for more than three years. When 2013 began, there were five surviving Raiders, but then Tom Griffin died. So now there are four: Dick Cole, Robert Hite, Edward Saylor and David Thatcher. Their annual April reunions have come to an end. But even with all their somber and prayerful annual toasts to those they have lost, they have never opened the bottle of 1896 cognac. The Doolittle bottle. Now, at the Air Force Museum, they will. It is unclear whether Robert Hite is in good enough health to make it to Dayton; the others plan to be there. This will be it, forever. When the bottle is opened, Cole said, ""I know there will be tears, at least in my case."" He said he hopes that today's young Americans will take one lesson from what the Doolittle Raiders did: . ""I would like for them to understand that there are times in one's life that require a lot of sacrifices. If you want to live free, you've got to make those sacrifices."" There is one piece of unfinished business: . Jimmy Doolittle, who died in 1993, was awarded the Medal of Honor. But the raid was not a one-man mission; Doolittle would have been the first to vociferously point that out. Friends and admirers of the Raiders have been trying to persuade Congress, in recognition of the Raiders' contribution to this country, to award the entire 80-man squad not the Medal of Honor, but the Congressional Gold Medal, one of our nation's highest tributes. No one is asking for Congress to strike 80 gold medals -- just one, in the Raiders' name, while some of the crew are still alive. You wouldn't think it would be difficult. The Congressional Gold Medal has been presented to, among others, Frank Sinatra and Arnold Palmer. You'd think the Doolittle Raiders would rate one. And their supporters have gone about the request in the proper way. A bill asking for authorization of the medal was introduced in a bipartisan manner: A Democrat, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, introduced it in the Senate, and a Republican, Pete Olson of Texas, introduced it in the House. Yet there it languishes. There are not enough co-sponsors in either chamber to get the medal authorized. The slowness seems to come not from any animosity, but from indifference. Congress has other things to do. Meanwhile, the clock ticks on the Raiders. Cole is 98; Saylor and Hite are 94; Thatcher is 92. As Brian Anderson -- a friend and longtime admirer of the Raiders who has worked to get the medal authorized and has tried to get the attention of members of Congress -- said: ""Time is not on the Raiders' side."" So those brave men will gather in Dayton next weekend for their final toast. Before they do, here is a simple question for Congress: . Can you not even do this right? The Doolittle Raiders have earned that medal. But it isn't the Raiders who should be grateful to be associated with Congress. It is Congress that should be proud and grateful to be permitted to be associated with the Raiders.","Bob Greene: The four remaining Doolittle Raiders are planning a final reunion on Saturday .

"(CNN)Having helped to plan my fair share of international conferences and summits, I know a real success when I see it. And the White House's summit on countering violence and extremism this week wasn't one. As an exercise in focusing on the homegrown aspects of countering extremism and facilitating better communication among religious, educational,  community leaders and law enforcement,  this week's three-day meeting had merit. But if the purpose of the summit was to craft a strategy -- even a political one -- to help defeat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), then its impact is likely to prove very limited indeed. That goal -- if it can be accomplished at all -- will only be realized by demonstrating that ISIS can't expand the territory under its control and govern effectively in the territory it currently controls. And that will require a long war and a sustainable military and political strategy involving local and regional allies. Of course, it is understandable why the summit was called -- the Obama administration's failure to send a high-level representative to Paris in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo terror attacks was widely criticized; and the summit had been postponed once before. It was, therefore, particularly important that the President demonstrate leadership in the fight against extremism. And it has to be said that convening a meeting of some 60 nations is no small achievement. Indeed, perhaps the most useful contribution of gathering so many officials together was that it will aid coordination of domestic efforts on how to preempt homegrown radicalism among young people. In that sense, the President was right to refer to the challenge as generational, something American Muslims have been active and alert to even before the summit began. But the summit also highlighted the limitations, contradictions and flaws in the approach the administration has embraced. The President went to great lengths to offer a strategic view of how to combat ISIS that focused on the importance of changing the way states in the region govern themselves. ""When people are oppressed and human rights are denied, particularly along sectarian lines or ethnic lines, when dissent is silenced, it feeds violent extremism,"" he said. There's no doubt that bad governance -- or even no governance -- has enabled the rise and success of ISIS. But the suggestion that democracy is an antidote to radical Islam only shines a light on some of America's key allies in the fight against ISIS, including the monarchies and sheikhdoms of the Arab Gulf, such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and states such as Egypt and Jordan. None could be described as anything close to a democracy, and none have any intention of undertaking serious reforms to become one. In fact, if the President wants to preserve his Sunni Arab coalition against ISIS, he'll have to do the opposite of what he's suggesting -- not push these countries to serious reform. Because if he does, they won't cooperate with him. This contradiction leads to a second problem -- the idea that a summit in Washington, or indeed anything made in America, will somehow lead to an effective counter narrative that will halt ISIS success at recruitment. The reality is that the United States has been particularly ill-suited to capturing the hearts and minds of Arab and Muslim youth, partly because of our policies in Iraq and Afghanistan, but also our support for authoritarian regimes, our drone strikes and our support for Israel. We may not actually have the problem in the right sequence. Instead of hearts and minds, it should be minds and hearts. First, you appeal to people on the basis of their interests, and then the emotional component follows. Many of the governments in the region lacking political inclusiveness and employment opportunities can't do this. And if their own governments can't provide a compelling alternative to the ISIS religious vision of some kind of Islamic caliphate, then how can the United States be expected to? There may be many reasons why ISIS succeeds in attracting followers -- personal frustration, alienated lives, a perverted fascination with violence and terror, a sense of identity and belonging. The question, then, is how do you craft a compelling counter vision for young people in the region or aggrieved European Muslims other than to say hammer ISIS's depravity? And when you do that, you simply reinforce conspiracies about the West and supposed plots against Islam. Neither democratic reform in the Arab world (highly unlikely), nor counter-messaging (probably ineffective), will check the rise of ISIS. That can be achieved only by a military and political strategy designed to demonstrate that ISIS has failed. And that means containing and reversing the group's gains through the use of air power, standing up local allies, marshaling a Sunni Arab coalition, and most likely by deploying additional U.S. Special Forces. There are many constraints inherent in this approach. Iranian-backed Shia militias feed ISIS recruitment by killing Sunnis. And Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria does the same. Meanwhile, ungoverned spaces in Libya and Yemen offer new opportunities for IS affiliates. But stopping ISIS gains and rolling them back in Iraq and over time in Syria are critical, and would be the best counter-narrative possible. The legitimacy of ISIS, Graeme Wood argues in a must-read piece in The Atlantic, depends on its ability to control territory -- its putative caliphate. In fact, that's what gives ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi his legitimacy. Rolling that back in Iraq and bleeding ISIS in Syria is the only way to demonstrate that the group has failed to deliver. All this underscores that we are in a long war, and one that will include some tough choices -- including how to deal with al-Assad, Iranian ambitions in Iraq, non-democratic allies, and the deployment of additional U.S. forces on the ground. Right now, however, this is the best approach we have. Hold another summit and try hearts and minds if you must. But the fight against ISIS will be won on the ground by showing the world that this quasi-state that aspires to re-create an 8th century, violent form of Islamic rule will not succeed in the 21st.","White House hosted summit this week on countering extremism .

"I'm one of the lucky ones. I landed a tenure-track job at a liberal arts college, a position that offers lots of personal interaction through teaching and advising. I get to bond with my students not only in the classroom, but also on nature retreats, at national conferences, and during travel seminars to other countries. When my students graduate, they tell me excitedly about their job offers and their acceptance letters to graduate school. I have a wonderful job. But my story is the exception. If higher education continues down its current path, full-time professors — already an endangered species — may become extinct. The reason: Uncontrollable fervor for online education. According to a jaw-dropping 2013 report by the Association of Governing Boards of Colleges and Universities, the percentage of tenure track (i.e., permanent, full-time) positions has plummeted from 78% in 1969 to about 33% today. The report warns that ""the rising numbers of non-tenure-track faculty in higher education are negatively affecting student success."" Even before the online revolution, full-time professor jobs were already on the decline as colleges and universities came to rely on an army of inexpensive adjunct instructors. William Pannapacker, an English professor and columnist for The Chronicle of Higher Education, notes that adjuncts make about $2,700 per class, ""without job security, benefits, academic freedom, or any say in institutional governance."" But large-scale online education initiatives may do even more harm to the profession of full-time college teaching. In the 2012 book ""The Idea of the Digital University,"" Frank McCluskey along with co-author Melanie Winter, argue that online learning is a direct cause of the rapid decrease in full-time, tenure-track positions. McCluskey, the retired provost of the American Public University System, believes online learning can be saved, but he says it's going in the wrong direction. ""As online learning has grown, tenure has declined,"" McCluskey told me. ""As technology has removed jobs from other sectors, such as finance and publishing, it is doing the same thing in higher education. But because we are labor intensive and low-tech, it got to us late."" When done right, online education can be a helpful complement to traditional classrooms. For example, my employer, Asbury University, has found a great balance between small online courses and traditional education. But in this season of economic uncertainty, the urge to convert traditional classes into impersonal, large-scale online courses is becoming irresistible to colleges and universities less committed to the sacred bond between teacher and student. The result? Fewer full-time professors. In the short term, it cuts costs. But in the long term, it could destroy America's higher education system. Quite depressingly, some online education experts have already disposed of the word ""professor."" ""The roles of those who decide to stay in higher education will shift to things such as content specialists, course facilitators, course designers and researchers,"" said Jonan Donaldson, instructional design specialist at Oregon State University and co-author of ""Massively Open: How Massive Open Online Courses Changed the World."" Donaldson believes a world without traditional professors is imminent. ""The job of the college professor as we know it will continue to exist in elite institutions, but in most cases it will cease to exist,"" he said. ""I predict that the change will come more rapidly than we can structurally or emotionally accommodate."" Sometime in the future, Donaldson predicts an improved higher education system, with better accountability and increased access for economically disadvantaged students. But in the meantime, Donaldson said: ""If our main concern is the happiness and well-being of professors, I'm afraid bad news is coming."" Bad news, indeed. In a recent Wall Street Journal article, ""Private Colleges Squeezed,"" Jonathan Henry, the vice president of enrollment management at Husson University in Maine, predicted that 30% of small, non-elite private colleges will vanish in the next decade. The ones who survive ""will have to learn to live with less,"" he told the Journal. Online education advocates often tout studies that supposedly show that online classrooms are just as effective as traditional classrooms. But loan default rates at online-only institutions tell another story. For years, we've seen reports that students from for-profit universities, which specialize in large-scale online models, have loan default rates that are much higher than those from nonprofit schools. In 2010, Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa published ""Debt Without a Diploma"" in which he stated that nearly a quarter of students from for-profit institutions default on their loans within three years. The Government Accountability Office subsequently launched an investigation and found deceptive recruiting practices at many of the largest universities in the online for-profit sector. Nevertheless, the mad scramble to contain costs by using large-scale online classes continues unabated. Between 2008 and 2013, the number of college students taking at least one online course nearly doubled, to 45%, according to a survey by Crux Research. While only 2.6% of higher education institutions currently have a ""massive open online course,""  or MOOC, more than 9% are planning for it, according to a study by Babson Survey Research Group. The logic seems to be: ""Why hire your own Ph.D. when you can show pre-recorded lectures to students hundreds of miles away, and then have their tests graded by a computer?"" Not all online education experts believe the job of full-time professor needs to vanish. McCluskey, for example, argues that by preserving tenure and keeping online classes small, universities can adapt to an online culture without losing their essence. ""I have watched MBAs use new management theories to make colleges more efficient,"" McCluskey told me. ""But higher education should not be efficient. Fast food restaurants are efficient."" Kim Zarkin, associate professor of communication at Westminster College in Salt Lake City, believes there will be a backlash against online courses done on the cheap. She predicts that negative experiences with impersonal programs will ultimately drive students into the arms of institutions focused on teaching and personal interaction. ""Saying that the MOOCs are a solution to everything is the equivalent of saying, 'There's the public library. Go get an education,'"" Zarkin said. For the sake of both students and professors, I hope Zarkin is right. I hope the job of full-time professor doesn't go the way of the dinosaur. But I see an asteroid coming.","David Wheeler: Tenure-track full-time professors are an endangered species .

"When Carole Kang woke up each morning, she grabbed her iPhone, pressed a few buttons and saw her son, Spencer, in a hospital a few miles away. Spencer, who weighed 2 pounds, 2 ounces when he was born prematurely, was in the neonatal intensive care unit at St. Jude Medical Center in Fullerton, California, for more than 11 weeks. Kang and her husband, Stephen, visited their son as often as possible while juggling responsibilities at work and home. But even when they couldn't be with Spencer, they could see him around the clock -- as long as they had an Internet connection. A camera mounted above Spencer's incubator provided the couple access to a live video stream that they could watch from their phones, laptops or computers. ""There were times in the middle of the night that I would have to see him,"" said Kang, who has logged on at 2 a.m. ""It would give me such a sense of relief."" St. Jude Medical Center is one of the first hospitals in the country to implement a webcam system called NICVIEW, which gives parents a virtual window to their newborns. Most of the babies in St. Jude's neonatal intensive care unit, which has 14 incubators, are born prematurely and are released within four or five days. Some, however, stay for months. The password-protected webcam system is also being used at a handful of hospitals across the country, including UMass Memorial Medical Center in Worcester, Massachusetts, and Deaconess Women's Hospital in Newburgh, Indiana. Parkview Community Hospital Medical Center in Riverside, California, expects to introduce the system in the next few weeks. Numerous other facilities are exploring the idea or looking for funding. Cameras run about $1,000 each in addition to an annual service fee that covers technical support and other costs. Those who have used the system said it is well worth the investment. ""The family feels that they are really connected to their infant, which is important for bonding. In the past, the bonding process had to be instituted every few days,"" said Dr. David Hicks, medical director of the neonatal intensive care unit at St. Jude Medical Center. ""The family dynamics are improved."" While the St. Jude unit has an open visitation policy, only adults are allowed in so as to protect the babies' immature and susceptible immune systems. In most cases, babies get well under intensive care. Individual cameras above each baby's incubator provide a continuous stream of live video. Hicks said he often waves to the camera to reassure family members. At St. Jude, one camera is designated per baby and is turned off only during medical treatments, rounds or at a doctor or nurse's discretion. ""The NICU is a special example of a time when parents need that bonding experience,"" said Blake Rutherford, one of the four partners/founders of NICVIEW, based in Kentucky. Parents have the option of sharing the password with relatives or friends who live far away, he said. About half of the sessions originate from Web-enabled devices such as iPads, iPhones, Droids and Blackberries, said Bill Nold, one of Rutherford's partners. ""We can tell that people are using these while they are sitting in a car,"" Nold said. Kang remembers how vital that access was for her family. When her husband returned to work, he hooked up another screen to his computer so he could see Spencer. ""When he had to be at one place to support his family, it gave him such closeness,"" said Kang, recalling the anguish the couple felt about having to leave their son at the hospital. ""He could have a connection with him every minute of the day. It's a priceless feeling. It's just an absolutely amazing tool."" Tracey Van Dell, governance manager for the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses, can see only one potential downfall to the system: the possibility that a parent witnesses an emergency situation before the camera can be turned off. Van Dell gave birth to premature twin sons, one of whom died in the neonatal intensive care unit. The other was released after six months. She said the advantages of the camera system far outweigh any possible downsides. ""I think it would help encourage parents to take care of themselves because it's an emotionally and physically draining experience,"" she said. Rutherford and his team, which includes developer Dominic Foster, came up with the idea for the camera system after visiting Deaconess, which was using cameras at infants' bedsides. Rutherford and his partners enhanced that basic camera system so that it would be compatible with any Web-enabled device and designed it so that it would not affect the performance of the hospital's network. Parents who had problems seeing their babies when the hospital was using its own system called the unit. Now those calls go straight to NICVIEW, freeing up the nurses to do their jobs, said Mary Stephens, nurse manager of the neonatal intensive care unit at the Women's Hospital. ""It really connects the families with their baby,"" Stephens said. ""It helps that separation. While that mom is at work, she can have access to seeing her baby and she doesn't feel like she missed that much."" Stephens said she sees other applications for the technology and said it could be used on older patients with dementia or other illnesses. Maureen Guzzi, nurse manager of the neonatal intensive care unit at UMass, agreed and said she sees an application for oncology. Using the cameras in the neonatal intensive care unit is particularly important, given the strain on a family that goes along with having a sick child, she said. Some babies can be there for six to eight months, she said. ""It's a very emotional time because (the parents) want to be here, but they have to go back to work,"" she said. UMass has six cameras that are mounted on IV poles. Guzzi said she hopes the hospital can buy enough to have one camera per infant and allow families access around the clock. Several staff members already have been trained on the system, learning where to place the cameras, how to turn them off and how to explain the process to parents. There have been some minor technical challenges, she said, but overall the hospital is thrilled with the system. The webcams recently were installed at Parkview Community Hospital Medical Center in Southern California. Staff members are being trained on the system, and the hospital is scheduled to begin using NICVIEW by Christmas, said Marlene Burnett, vice president of business development. Many babies who are brought to the neonatal intensive care unit at Parkview are transported from other hospitals. The system will make it easier for parents who live 30 minutes or more away to see their babies, she said. ""It's more important for them to have that Internet access to their babies,"" Burnett said. Betty Rowzee, clinical manager of the neonatal intensive care unit, said babies at Parkview typically stay for seven to 14 days. While most are premature, others are full-term babies with infections or feeding or blood sugar problems. Noelani Dauphinee, who delivered at St. Jude, said the system was a blessing for her and her family. Her son, Jonathan, lived for only a week. Relatives in Hawaii, Arizona and on the East Coast saw him on the webcam and talked about how much that meant at the baby's funeral, she said. ""You just never know how precious those moments will end up being,"" she said. ""In our case it went from being OK to a lot worse in a matter of hours, and it made such a huge difference to be able to know that we had that access.""","California's St. Jude Medical Center is one of the first hospitals to use webcam system .

"After years policing Illinois streets for criminals, Drew Peterson is now among them -- and will be for more than three decades, a judge ruled Thursday. Will County Judge Edward Burmila sentenced Peterson to 38 years in prison in the murder of his third ex-wife, Kathleen Savio, said state's attorney spokesman Charles B. Pelkie. The former Chicago-area police sergeant will get credit for the nearly four years that he has been in custody, according to Pelkie, a spokesman for Will County State's Attorney James Glasgow. He could have received as many as 60 years in prison; Illinois does not have a death penalty. ""The reason that I never looked Drew Peterson in the eye is because I never acknowledged his existence,"" said Glasgow, describing the convict as a ""cold-blooded killer."" ""But I looked him in the eye today,"" the prosecutor said. ""He knows that we did our job."" Peterson was convicted of murder in September but had fought for a new trial, an effort that Burmila denied Thursday, just before the sentencing. Peterson's lawyers promised Thursday that they would press on with their appeal and expressed confidence they would prevail. They stood by their client, who defiantly claimed in court that he didn't kill Savio. ""Wouldn't you be angry if you were wrongly convicted?"" said one of his attorneys, Steve Greenberg. ""In this case, (the prosecution) changed everything ... How would you feel if you were railroaded?"" Savio was found dead in her dry, clean bathtub on March 1, 2004. Prosecutors said Peterson killed her; the defense contended that she fell, hit her head and drowned. The case did not grab headlines until after Peterson's fourth wife, Stacy, disappeared in October 2007. It was during the search for Stacy Peterson -- who still has not been found -- that investigators said they'd look again into Savio's death, which was initially ruled an accidental drowning. Authorities altered their judgment and ruled Savio's death a homicide in February 2008, setting the stage for the first-degree murder trial last year of Peterson, a former police officer in Bolingbrook, Illinois. A Will County jury ultimately convicted him of murder after nearly 14 hours of deliberation. That was four months ago. On Thursday, all the parties were back in court to see whether Peterson would get a new trial or, if not, what his sentence would be. Perhaps the most emotional part of this court proceeding was Peterson's long and emotional remarks, which were interrupted at times by shouts from Savio family members, several of whom were asked to leave the courtroom. He unloaded ""pent-up anger"" that had built up over time -- against Savio and her family, the legal process, the media, even a TV movie about the case, according to his attorneys and the prosecutor. Above all, Peterson loudly insisted that he did not kill Savio. Why was he upset? One of his lawyers, David Peilet, said part of it has to do with Peterson feeling the system that he served -- as a military veteran and longtime police officer -- had failed him. ""(He is angry) especially when you are somebody who has defended the Constitution and served and protected the public, now being faced with the same system coming up and biting (you) in the butt,"" Peilet said. Glasgow, the state's attorney, had a different take. He called Peterson's remarks ""pathetic,"" especially in how he ""attacked"" Savio and her mental state. ""Just depraved,"" the prosecutor said. ""... We all got an opportunity to see a psychopath reveal himself in open court."" It was a sentiment echoed by the victim's sister, Susan Doman. She said she couldn't stand to hear ""the devil"" demean her sister, almost nine years after her death. ""He battered her to the very end."" Pam Bosco, a spokeswoman for Stacy Peterson's family, lauded the prosecution for making ""this world a safer, better place"" by fighting to convict Peterson and expressed hope he'd next be held accountable for what happened to his fourth wife. ""It's not over for us, but of course, a win for the Savio family is a win for the Stacy Peterson family,"" Bosco said. ""We have a long journey ahead. We still want to see justice for Stacy. We won't give up."" Several Savio family members specifically mentioned Stacy when they addressed reporters late Thursday afternoon in Joliet. Henry Savio Jr., a brother of Kathleen Savio, said Stacy Peterson's relatives ""deserve the same thing that we're getting right now: justice."" As to Peterson's fate, Henry Savio said he wanted him to ""stay in jail forever, to die there."" ""(Then) he is going to go to hell,"" the victim's brother said. ""And my sister is going to be watching him.""","Drew Peterson's lawyer says his client feels the system he served failed him .

"Most of us with 401(k) plans watched in horror, as our retirement savings plummeted in the stock market crash of 2008. That year, the average 401(k) balance dropped by a third, forcing older Americans to delay retirement or cut back on spending. Since then, as the market rebounded, some of our savings have recovered in fits and starts. The crash showed one serious downside to 401(k)s: their complete exposure to the wild swings of the market. But what you may not realize is that even when the stock market is zooming ahead, hidden fees take an unacceptably high share of your investment return. If your immediate response is, ""Oh, I know how much my 401(k) is costing me,"" then you're one of small numbers of Americans who's in the know. According to a recent AARP survey, 71% of people with 401(k)s didn't even know they were paying fees for their retirement accounts. So how much do these fees really cost you? The answer may shock you. Fees can, on average, reduce your 401(k) balance by up to 30%, regardless of whether you have $1 or $1 million in your retirement account. You may wonder -- is 30% a big deal? Yes. Let's look at a hypothetical model of say, an average two-earner household where the combined earnings is between $50,000 and $70,000 a year over the course of 40 years (from ages 25 to 65). This couple, unlike most Americans, consistently saves between 5% to 9% of their salaries each year and puts that money into a 401(k) account, gradually increasing their yearly contribution over time. And atypically, they never have to withdraw from this account. They invest their 401(k) account equally in a stock mutual fund and a bond mutual fund, each of which charges average market fees. For such a household, 401(k) fees will cost $155,000 over a lifetime, which leaves the couple with about $350,000 in 401(k) income at retirement. This may sound like a large amount, but if the couple spends this nest egg at the 4% annual rate recommended by financial advisers, they will have a mere $14,000 yearly supplement to their Social Security benefits -- not exactly a king's ransom. However, $350,000 is by far more than what most Americans save. According to the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances, the average household approaching retirement has only $100,000 in total retirement savings among all of their accounts. What are these fees, then, that are taking such a big bite out of your retirement account? There are four kinds: administrative fees, marketing fees (sometimes called 12-b1 fees), investment management fees and trading costs. The first three types of fees are shown, as an aggregate total, in each mutual fund's expense ratio, and are generally reported in your 401(k)'s ""summary documents"" as a percentage of assets. For example, if you had $50,000 invested in a mutual fund that has an expense ratio of 1%, it means that you pay 1%, or $500, of the total balance you have invested in the fund in fees. This 1% is charged each year regardless of the mutual fund's performance. However, the expense ratio does not include the last type of fee -- trading costs. Despite this omission, rest assured that you are indeed paying this fee as well. Trading costs are pretty complex, but the best way to understand them is to know simply that they rise the more often a mutual fund buys and sells its assets, i.e., the more it is being ""actively managed."" If you knew that 30% of your retirement savings are chipped off, you would probably be outraged. It seems like a steep price to pay for investment management, doesn't it? But the investment industry disagrees, arguing that such costs are justified because mutual fund expenses are regulated by the competition of the free market, and what consumers are paying is simply the cost of doing business. The problem with this argument is that it's not true. Index funds, for example, have often outperformed actively managed mutual funds while charging a small fraction of the fees. But investing more in index funds will not come close to fixing the broken, expensive 401(k) system. There's no way around it: the mutual fund system we have can't be fixed, and must be replaced. Why? Because everything about the 401(k) is too individualized: investment management, risk and fees. We need a new type of retirement account that is somewhere between a traditional pension and a 401(k) that combines some of the best features of each. To minimize the excessive risks of the stock market and keep down investment management costs, we can invest the funds from all the individual retirement accounts as a pool, mirroring the way that the assets of a traditional pension fund are invested. Pooling maximizes returns for all participants by allowing managers to invest in a more diversified portfolio and over a longer investment horizon. The government should administer these retirement accounts, making sure that everyone can participate and the pools are as large as possible. However, investment management can and should be bid out to private companies  to foster competition. This is one proposal. It's worth exploring.

"In terms of online entertainment, the World Cup seemed to have it all. There was a cannibalistic Luis Suarez. Tim Howard saving ... well ... everything. Sad Brazilians. And Cristiano Ronaldo's hair. Oh, yeah ... and the actual matches, which saw the U.S. team make an inspiring run, the powerhouse Brazilians unravel in shocking fashion and the Germans ultimately capture first prize on Sunday. The month-long spectacle also captured another prize: It's now the biggest social event in Web history. On Facebook, Sunday's final between Germany and Argentina alone spurred 280 million interactions by 88 million people, according to the company. That easily surpassed the former champ, last year's Super Bowl, with its 245 million interactions. Things were similarly fast and furious on Twitter, where the match was inspiring more than 618,000 tweets per minute, a new record for the site. There were a total of 32.1 million tweets about the match. Take those numbers and tack them onto the huge online engagement the tournament had already inspired and it's a no-brainer that Brazil 2014 enjoyed online fandom like no event before it. From June 12 to July 13, 350 million people generated a massive 3 billion World Cup posts, comments and likes, according to Facebok. In just its first week, from June 12-18, the tournament inspired 459 million Facebook interactions -- more than this year's Super Bowl, the Academy Awards in March and the Sochi Winter Olympics combined. FIFA, international soccer's ruling body, says that more than 1 billion people engaged with World Cup content through its website, social media accounts and mobile app. The official FIFA app became the biggest sports-event app ever, with 28 million downloads, 451 million Facebook users were reached by FIFA's page and its Instagram account rocketed from 42,000 followers to nearly 1 million in 31 days. ""This has been the first truly mobile and social World Cup,"" FIFA President Sepp Blatter said. ""The 1 billion attendance in the global stadium created the sense of togetherness the World Cup brings and the shared excitement that digital platforms offer."" Certainly, the global appeal of the World Cup played a huge part in the tournament's popularity. But the big numbers were clearly being bolstered by growing interest in the United States, one of the few nations where soccer isn't, hands-down, the most popular sport. During Sunday's final, 10.5 million of the people engaged on Facebook were from the United States. Compare that to the 7 million people in Argentina and 5 million in Germany, the match's actual participants, and you can see that U.S. interest in the tourney didn't disappear when the American side bowed out. In the 28 days before the U.S. team lost to Belgium in the knockout round,  36.7 million U.S. fans engaged with the World Cup's online properties, a spokesman for the organization said. That's 11.2% of the country's population and accounted for 23% of the total activity during that time. In all, 42 million U.S. fans visited FIFA Web and mobile tools during the entire tournament. As the U.S. men's team played its way out of a tough opening-round group that included Germany, Portugal and Ghana, U.S. Web users spent a total of 847 years and 143 days engaged with FIFA content. That's more than soccer-crazy rivals Brazil, Germany, England and France combined. ""The popularity of the World Cup in the USA shows what a nation of sports lovers and enthusiasts they are,"" Blatter said. ""The carnival atmosphere experienced at the World Cup viewing parties, where fans filled whole city blocks across the U.S., shows the passion that Jürgen Klinsmann's side has instilled in U.S. sports fans.""","The World Cup tournament shattered social-media records .

"It began for Nickolay Lamm as a question: What would Barbie look like if she had the dimensions of an average woman? His answer came in the form of the Lammily doll: a shorter, broader, brunette version of the idealistic blond Mattel doll. Now Lammily is ready to make her debut, complete with a sticker pack that features pimples, moles, cellulite and scars that can be applied. ""I feel she looks so real, so ordinary, that you don't focus on what she looks like but ... on what she does,"" he said by telephone on Wednesday. That perspective helped propel Lamm's crowd-funding effort to build the doll. The 26-year-old toy maker said the dolls will be mailed to his crowd-funding backers no later than Black Friday, the traditional kickoff for holiday shopping. Thousands more, which were preordered, will also be shipped before the holidays, he said. Here's what you need to know about Lamm and the doll: . Germ of an idea . It began in 2013, when Lamm began playing with the idea of what Barbie would look like as an average woman. But what were those dimensions? He got the answer from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (For the record, the CDC says the average American woman weighs 166.2 pounds and has a 37.5 inch waist.) The initial version of the doll was an art project of sorts, with Lamm creating a model of the average woman and doing a side-by-side comparison with Barbie. The response to the project was overwhelming, with even actress and singer Demi Lovato taking to Twitter to call Lamm's doll ""awesome."" The response in turn prompted Lamm's crowd-funding effort to create the doll. He raised nearly $100,000 in a single day, and within 30 days he had raised more than $500,000. Average is beautiful . The doll, with its wide hips, thick legs and rounded rump, goes against the concept of the perfect figure. ""The message I want to send is that it's not what you look like. That doesn't define you. What you do does,"" he said. Lamm said he took inspiration for the doll from his own experience in high school, which he described as the ""worst time in my life."" ""I really cared about how I looked, and I didn't feel good about myself,"" he said. Acne and a clothing line . Billed as Lammily Marks, the $5.99 accessory pack will be on sale in January. The idea, Lamm said, is two-fold: Realism and innovation. People have acne, tattoos, moles and scars, he said. While realism is an issue, Lamm said to grow the fledgling company there also has to be innovation. ""You have to be one step ahead,"" he said. Part of the step also includes launching a doll clothing line, dubbed Lammily's World of Fashion. Down the road, Lamm said he plans to release a boy doll. Eventually, he said he would like to follow the Build-A-Bear Workshop model, where children could design their own Lammily dolls with custom features. What's in a name? The doll is not named Lammily. Rather, Lamm said, that's the name of the company. ""With the name, I combined by my Lamm and family,"" he said. A number of his family members have played a role in helping him develop the doll, including creating the box and the stickers. So, what's the doll's name? Whatever you want it to be, Lamm said. The dolls come with a numbered passport that allows you to name the doll. Lamm said the company website will eventually include a database where people can register the name of their doll. What does Mattel have to say? Nothing at the moment. Mattel did not return a telephone call from CNN seeking comment about the doll.","The Lammily doll is the antithesis of Barbie .

"Former NFL star Darren Sharper has been charged in another sexual assault case -- this time in Arizona. A grand jury in Tempe indicted Sharper on two counts of sexual assault and three counts of administering dangerous drugs relating to an incident alleged to have happened on November 21, Tempe police said Wednesday. Detectives served an attorney for Sharper with the indictment on Wednesday morning, police said. Authorities have said Sharper, 38, is under investigation in four other states -- California, Louisiana, Nevada and Florida -- in cases of alleged sexual assault. So far, he has been charged only in California and Arizona. New Orleans police have issued an arrest warrant for Sharper, who is in custody in Los Angeles and is scheduled to attend an extradition hearing Thursday. Another man accused in the New Orleans case, Erik Nunez, was charged last week with two counts of aggravated rape and released on $400,000 bail Monday, CNN affiliate WVUE reported. ""I'm more than sure that when it's all said and done, he'll be vindicated,"" his attorney Jeffrey Smith told the station. The application for the arrest warrant states that New Orleans detectives interviewed two women who said they were raped on September 23. The two accusers told police they were so impaired that they don't recall ""the entirety of the sexual intercourse,"" and that they never agreed to have sex. The document describes how a friend came to the apartment and saw Sharper in his underwear and Nunez exiting Sharper's bedroom in just his boxer shorts. Police said through further investigation they found other witnesses who told them Sharper and Nunez admitted to sexual acts without the women's permission or knowledge. In February, Sharper pleaded not guilty in a Los Angeles court to charges of rape by use of drugs, furnishing a controlled substance and possession of a controlled substance, all felonies. Those alleged rapes occurred in October 2013 and last month, authorities said. His attorneys said he maintains any sex was consensual. In addition, a Florida woman last month filed a sexual battery complaint in Miami Beach against Sharper relating to a 2012 incident, a police report said. According to the report, the woman was with two friends at a Miami Beach club in September or October 2012 when she met Sharper. The woman, her friends and another person went to Sharper's condo, where the woman claims the battery took place. Miami Beach police are investigating the case, Miami Beach Detective Vivian Hernandez said last month. Sharper played for the Green Bay Packers, Minnesota Vikings and New Orleans Saints from 1997 through the 2010 season. The five-time Pro Bowl player intercepted 63 passes in his career, tying for seventh all-time; and he is tied for second all-time in interceptions returned for touchdowns with 11, according to Pro-Football-Reference.com. He was recently fired as an NFL Network analyst.","Former NFL Pro Bowler Darren Sharper is charged with two rapes in Tempe, Arizona .

"The first human trial of an experimental Ebola vaccine has produced promising results, U.S. scientists said, raising hopes that protection from the deadly disease may be on the horizon. All 20 healthy adults who received the vaccine in a trial run by researchers from the National Institutes of Health in Maryland produced an immune response and developed anti-Ebola antibodies, the NIH said Wednesday. None suffered serious side effects, although two people developed a brief fever within a day of vaccination. The vaccine is being developed by the NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and British pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline. The process has been fast-tracked in light of the current catastrophic Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which has claimed more than 5,000 lives. ""Based on these positive results from the first human trial of this candidate vaccine, we are continuing our accelerated plan for larger trials to determine if the vaccine is efficacious in preventing Ebola infection,"" said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. In this trial, genetic material from two strains of the Ebola virus, Sudan and Zaire, was delivered using a chimpanzee cold virus that does not harm humans. The vaccine does not contain the Ebola virus and cannot cause a person to be infected with Ebola, the NIH said. The current outbreak involves the Zaire strain. Blood tested . The adults, volunteers ages 18 to 50, were split into two groups. Half received an intramuscular injection of vaccine at a lower dose and 10 received the same vaccine at a higher dose, the NIH said. Researchers tested the volunteers' blood at two weeks and four weeks after vaccination to determine if anti-Ebola antibodies had been produced. All 20 volunteers developed such antibodies within four weeks of receiving the vaccine, with levels higher in those who were given the higher-dose vaccine. The researchers also looked to see if the vaccine prompted production of immune system cells called T cells, after a previous study on primates using the same vaccine suggested they may also help to protect from the disease. They found that many of the volunteers did produce T cells, including CD8 T cells, which may play a crucial role in protecting against infection by Ebola viruses. Four weeks after vaccination, the CD8 T cells were found in two volunteers who received the lower-dose vaccine and in seven who had the higher dose, the NIH said. The two volunteers who briefly developed a fever had received the higher-dose vaccine. Unanswered questions . Professor Andrew Easton, a leading virologist at Britain's Warwick University, told CNN that the trial was an ""essential first step"" toward a vaccine to prevent Ebola and justifies some optimism. However, there are still some unanswered questions, he said. ""We know from some of the preliminary work that went on in animal studies previously that the antibodies that are generated in response to the vaccine don't last as long as we would like -- there was a clear reduction over a fairly long period of time, about 10 months,"" he said. ""So it's possible that that might be a problem in humans, but the reality is we won't know until it's actually been tested in humans. ""We can hope that it will provide a longer-term protection. If it doesn't, at least it gives us some level of protection over a window, which could be enormously valuable in protecting people from outbreaks at the time the outbreaks occur."" Other approaches are being looked at too, he said, and will also benefit from the World Health Organization's decision this summer to allow some processes to be fast-tracked. WHO: Sierra Leone cases may be increasing . If further clinical trials result in an effective vaccine, health care workers on the front line of the fight against Ebola are likely to be the first to receive it. The virus has already taken a heavy toll on those caring for Ebola patients, with 592 health care workers known to have been infected, including 340 who have died, according to WHO. In total, 5,689 people have died from the Ebola virus, as of November 23, the WHO said in an update Wednesday. There have been 15,935 cases in eight countries since the outbreak began, but Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone remain by far the worst affected countries. They reported 600 new cases in the week ending Sunday, with 385 of those in Sierra Leone. ""Case incidence is stable in Guinea, stable or declining in Liberia, but may still be increasing in Sierra Leone,"" the WHO said. The WHO update also warned that cases and deaths continue to be under-reported in this outbreak. Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone have between them recorded 15,901 cases and 5,674 deaths attributed to the virus since the beginning of the outbreak.","A virologist says the trial is an essential first step and justifies some optimism .

"Online delivery services have a checkered history at best. But Uber, the app-oriented car service, is giving it another go. The company, which lets app users hook up with nearby drivers for hire, has announced Uber Rush, which promises to let ""your packages travel like a VIP."" Being tested only in Manhattan, it's a lot like a typical courier service. First, users summon up a vehicular courier (the company's reportedly adding bike and foot messengers to its fleet). Next, the app quotes them a price. And then the courier hauls an item or items from Point A to Point B. The service doesn't allow users to order items, such as lunch, and have them delivered. It's just for transporting items already in their possession. Rush is now an option on the existing Uber app in areas where it is available. During the initial dotcom boom of the late '90s and early 2000s, several online delivery services tried, and failed, to catch on. Kozmo.com is a classic story from the dotcom bubble burst. The website, which promised to deliver items such as DVDs, food and Starbucks coffee within one hour, raised $250 million in capital, launched in 1998 and was out of business by 2001. Webvan, an online grocery-delivery service, went bottom-up the same year, in what some have called the biggest dotcom flop in history. But the emergence of mobile technology has some Web players reconsidering the quick-delivery model. Ebay Now promises delivery of good from local stores in less than two hours for a $5 fee. The Postmates app similarly offers food and other goods delivered for prices starting at $5. Prices for Uber Rush appear to be higher ($20-$25), more in line with what New York City couriers typically charge. Uber's model is to take 20% of whatever price their drivers charge. Uber uses drivers who have applied to participate and who have passed background checks and other vetting to ensure they are properly licensed and insured. They must be at least 23. The company says it will expand Rush to other areas of New York if it succeeds in its initial test phase.","Uber rolled out a new delivery service, Rush .

"It's a potential game changer in the fight against HIV, and doctors say it happened almost by accident. A baby with the virus that causes AIDS was given high doses of three antiretroviral  drugs within 30 hours of her birth. Doctors knew the mother was HIV positive and administered the drugs in hopes of controlling the virus. Two years later, there is no evidence of HIV in the child's blood. The Mississippi girl is the first child to be ""functionally cured"" of HIV, researchers announced Sunday. They said they believe early intervention with the antiretroviral  drugs was key to the outcome. A ""functional cure"" is when the presence of the virus is so small, lifelong treatment is not necessary and standard clinical tests cannot detect the virus in the blood. Timeline: AIDS moments to remember . The finding was announced at the 2013 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Atlanta. The unidentified girl was born HIV positive to a mother who received no prenatal care and was not diagnosed as HIV positive herself until just before delivery. ""We didn't have the opportunity to treat the mom during the pregnancy as we would like to be able do to prevent transmission to the baby,"" said Dr. Hannah Gay, a pediatric HIV specialist at the University of Mississippi Medical Center. Gay told CNN the timing of intervention -- before the baby's HIV diagnosis -- may deserve ""more emphasis than the particular drugs or number of drugs used."" ""We are hoping that future studies will show that very early institution of effective therapy will result in this same outcome consistently,"" she said on the eve of the Atlanta conference. High-risk exposure . Dr. Katherine Luzuriaga, an immunologist at the University of Massachusetts who worked closely with Gay, called the developments fascinating, including the fact that the toddler was found to have no virus in her blood even after her mother stopped giving her treatment for eight to 10 months. ""This is the very first case in which we've conclusively been able to document that the baby was infected and then after a period of treatment has been able to go off treatment without viral rebound,"" Luzuriaga told CNN. Once it was determined the Mississippi mother was HIV positive, Gay immediately began giving the infant antiretroviral drugs upon the baby's delivery in an attempt to control HIV infection. Read more: Why youths aren't getting tested for HIV . ""We started therapy as early as possible, which in this case was about 30 hours of age,"" the physician said. ""And because it was a high-risk exposure, I decided to use three drugs rather than one."" Within a couple of days, Gay confirmed the child was HIV positive. She said the baby had probably been infected in the womb. The child remained on antiretroviral drugs for about 15 months. Her mother then stopped administering the drug for some reason, and care was resumed after health officials intervened, Gay said. Researchers have long known that treating HIV-positive mothers early on is important, because they pass antibodies on to their babies. ""One hundred percent of (HIV-positive) moms will pass those antibodies, but in the absence of treatment, only 30% of moms will transmit the actual virus,"" Luzuriaga told CNN. HIV-positive mothers given appropriate treatment pass the virus on in less than 2% of cases, Luzuriaga said. ""So all babies are born antibody positive, but only a fraction of babies born to HIV-positive women will actually get the virus, and that fraction depends on whether the mom and baby are getting antiviral prophylaxis (preventative treatment) or not,"" Luzuriaga said. Newborns are considered high-risk if their mothers' HIV infections are not under control or if they are found to be HIV positive when they're close to delivering. Moving quickly to suppress the virus . Usually, these infants would get antiviral drugs at preventative doses for six weeks to prevent infection, then start therapy if HIV is diagnosed. Investigators said the Mississippi case may change that practice because it highlights the potential for cure with early standard antiretroviral therapy, or ART. ART is a combination of at least three drugs used to suppress the virus and stop the progression of the disease. But they do not kill the virus. Tests showed the virus in the Mississippi baby's blood continued to decrease and reached undetectable levels within 29 days of the initial treatment. Dr. Deborah Persaud, a virologist with Johns Hopkins Children's Center, was lead author on the report presented at the conference. The early treatment likely led to the infant's cure, she said. 'Like pulling teeth' to get doctors to test for HIV . ""Prompt antiviral therapy in newborns that begins within days of exposure may help infants clear the virus and achieve long-term remission without lifelong treatment by preventing such viral hideouts from forming in the first place,"" Persaud said. Persaud and Luzuriaga are part of a group of researchers working to explore and document possible pediatric HIV cure cases. The group was funded by a grant from amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research, and the National Institutes of Health. Dr. Rowena Johnston, amfAR vice president and director of research, said it is ""imperative that we learn more about a newborn's immune system, how it differs from an adults and what factors made it possible for the child to be cured."" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, said he is enthusiastic about the findings. ""The best way to either eliminate the virus or allow the immune system to suppress residual virus is to treat someone as early as possible after infection so as not to allow a substantial reservoir of the virus to take hold,"" Fauci told CNN. ""At the same time, you prevent the immune system from being severely damaged by the continual replication of (the) virus for an extended period of time,"" he said. ""The situation with a child born of an infected mother where most of the infections are transmitted to the newborn at or around the time of delivery provides an excellent opportunity to cure an infected baby, and this approach deserves further study."" 'Berlin patient' Researchers say the only other documented case of an HIV cure is that of Timothy Brown, known as the ""Berlin patient."" In 2007, Brown, an HIV-positive American living in Germany, was battling both leukemia and HIV when he underwent a bone marrow transplant that cured not only his cancer but his HIV. In an interview last year, Brown told Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, he was still HIV-free. ""I've been tested everywhere possible,"" said Brown, who now lives in San Francisco. ""My blood's been tested by many, many agencies. I've had two colonoscopies to test to see if they could find HIV in my colon, and they haven't been able to find any."" But Brown's case is rare. And the procedure, which is extremely dangerous, won't work in most patients because the bone marrow he received had a special genetic mutation that made the stem cells in it naturally resistant to the virus. Researchers tell CNN only 1% of Caucasians -- mostly Northern Europeans -- and no African-Americans or Asians have this particular mutation. In June, five years after he was ""cured,"" reports surfaced that ""traces"" of the virus had been found in Brown's blood. Even then, some HIV experts said that doesn't matter, that he's been cured. In fact, many AIDS experts said they believe Brown has experienced what's called a ""sterilizing"" cure, meaning the virus has been eliminated from the body entirely. Routine clinical testing on the Mississippi toddler continues, Gay said. So far, there is no evidence of the virus. ""On the ultra-sensitive testing, we are occasionally getting signals so we cannot say with certainty that this child is absolutely clear of HIV, but we will continue to follow up with the baby,"" Luzuriaga said. ""We have formed a hypothesis and that is already driving the design of new studies and clinical trials that will help us to answer the question of whether by coming in very early we will be able to treat children for a while and then remove them from therapy.""

"Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy's remarks about whether ""the Negro"" fared better under slavery represents the latest in a series of incendiary racial comments from a new crop of folk heroes embraced in some conservative circles. ""They abort their young children, they put their young men in jail, because they never learned how to pick cotton,"" Bundy said to reporters, according to The New York Times. ""And I've often wondered, are they better off as slaves, picking cotton and having a family life and doing things, or are they better off under government subsidy? They didn't get no more freedom. They got less freedom,"" he was quoted as saying. Bundy, 67, a rancher whose much-publicized land dispute with the federal government endeared him to conservatives, defended his comments as idle thoughts. ""In my mind I'm wondering, are they better off being slaves, in that sense, or better off being slaves to the United States government, in the sense of the subsidies? I'm wondering. That's what. And the statement was right. I am wondering,"" he said Thursday on ""The Peter Schiff Show."" Bundy stood by those comments in interviews with CNN on Thursday and Friday. That defense included a tense exchange Friday morning with ""New Day"" anchor Chris Cuomo. ""Maybe I sinned ... and maybe I don't know what I actually said. ... If I say Negro or black or slave ... if those people cannot take those kind of words and not be (offended), then Martin Luther King hasn't got his job done yet. ... We need to get over this prejudice stuff,"" Bundy said. ""I don't think I'm wrong,"" he also told CNN's Bill Weir on Thursday night. ""I think I'm right."" But politicians such as Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a potential 2016 presidential GOP contender, Republican Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada and other conservatives scrambled to distance themselves from the controversy. ""His remarks on race are offensive and I wholeheartedly disagree with him,"" Paul said in a statement. Heller ""completely disagrees with Mr. Bundy's appalling and racist statements, and condemns them in the most strenuous way,"" according to his spokesman, Chandler Smith. The Republican National Committee said Bundy's comments were ""completely beyond the pale. Both highly offensive and 100% wrong on race."" But experts on race and politics say the comments, much like those of rocker Ted Nugent, who created a firestorm when he called President Barack Obama a ""subhuman mongrel,"" also speak to complicated and deeply fraught cultural tensions running beneath the surface in some segments of America. ""We are looking at some of the 'last white men standing,' "" Mark Anthony Neal, an African-American studies professor at Duke University, said of demographic shifts that show minorities now represent more than half of the nation's population born in 2010 and 2011, according to the most recent census data. ""His comments represent that, and people rally around him because of this idea that white men are under siege. They are calling out the political establishment to stand by them,"" he said. Over the next several generations, political experts say minority voters will become more of a power base in the Deep South, the Southwest and in California. During the 2012 presidential election, Republicans faced huge losses among minorities and women, prompting the GOP to re-examine outreach to those groups. But Bundy's comments -- much like those of Nugent and ""Duck Dynasty "" star Phil Robertson, who shared during an interview with GQ last year pastoral recollections of blacks ""singing and happy"" as he and his family worked alongside them in Louisiana cotton fields -- speak to a certain politically active fringe element, political experts say. Among those who support views of limited government, there is often a ""higher than average endorsement of views that could be seen as racial resentment,"" said Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University. ""What this reflects is that there are groups of people who have not been accepted by politically correct circles and have never learned to frame their comments in a palatable fashion. They take pride in that,"" Gillespie said. ""The articulation of their views is somewhat fringe, but the underlying attitude is not. They are a minority viewpoint, but they are a large minority."" And that's put politicians who have previously embraced men such as Bundy, Nugent and Robertson as cause célèbres in an awkward position. For instance, Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, his state's Republican nominee for governor, took heat from some quarters when Nugent appeared at a campaign event for him this year. Abbott's campaign said it did not endorse Nugent's comments. Other Republicans viewed as potential presidential candidates, including Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and the state's governor, Rick Perry, also distanced themselves from Nugent's remarks. Paul said an apology was in order, which Nugent eventually offered for using the term. Conservative radio host Sean Hannity said on his show that he worries Democrats will now use Bundy's ""repugnant"" and ""despicable"" comments to paint everyone on the far right as racists. The Democratic National Committee pounced on Bundy's remarks. ""If you ever want to be taken seriously for your outreach efforts, you might want to start by not defending racists,"" DNC spokesman Mo Elleithee said in a statement.

"For many years, it was a rite of fall. You moved into your dorm room or new apartment. You started unpacking the car. And the first thing you set up in your new place was the stereo system: receiver, turntable or CD player, tape deck and speakers. The wires could get tangled, and sometimes you had to make shelving out of a stack of milk crates. But only when the music was playing on those handpicked CDs, mix tapes or (geezer alert!) vinyl records did you move in the rest of your stuff. Daniel Rubio wouldn't know. To the 23-year-old, new dorm rooms and new apartments have meant computers, iTunes, Pandora and miniature speakers. ""All I had to bring was my laptop. That's pretty much what everyone had,"" says Rubio, who attended Emory University in Atlanta and now works for a local marketing and communications firm. ""It was actually pretty good sound. It would get the job done."" ""Get the job done""? That sounds like the white flag for an era that used to be measured in woofers and tweeters, watts per channel and the size of your record collection. Related: Old LPs get second life . Indeed, the days of the old-fashioned component stereo system are pretty much over, says Alan Penchansky, an audiophile and former columnist for the music trade publication Billboard. ""What's happened in the marketplace, the midmarket for audio has completely been obliterated,"" he says. ""You have this high-end market that's getting smaller all the time, and then you've got the convenience market, which has taken over -- the MP3s, the Bluetooth devices, playing on laptops."" He wishes more people knew what they were missing. At its best, he says, audio reproduction has ""a religious aspect."" ""There's a primacy to audio,"" he says. ""It's a form of magic."" Wires and jacks . Of course, new technology changes things all the time. When was the last time you bought a roll of film for your camera? Still, for a long time -- and for a certain, often youthful, audience -- the stereo system was a point of pride. Greg Milner, the author of the audio recording history ""Perfecting Sound Forever,"" remembers the process. There were components. There were boxes of tapes and CDs. There might even be some vinyl. It could be a pain, no question. The equipment was heavy. There were all those wires, plugs and jacks -- Line In, Line Out, Aux, Phono, CD, keeping track of the positive and negative strands of speaker wire. It was an effort just to break down and set up the stuff, never mind moving it. Milner, for example, grew up in Hawaii, and when he went away to school in Minnesota, he had to figure out what he was going to do with his system. ""I remember agonizing, what do I do? I can't take my stereo,"" he recalls. ""There was this thing that, looking back on it, took up a ridiculous amount of psychic energy."" Audiophiles vs. AM radio . However, he observes that the history of audio technology has often been one of convenience. Even in the '50s and '60s, when stereo sound first became widespread, the audiophiles had their hi-fis -- and the younger generation listened to tinny AM radios and cheap phonographs. Indeed, music styles had a lot to do with music consumption, he points out. Audiophiles listened to classical and jazz, music from clubs and concert halls. On a good system, you could hear every pluck of a violin pizzicato, every inflection of a jazz singer's vocal, recreated in your living room. The kids, on the other hand, listened to cruder rock 'n' roll. ""The seeds of the decline of what it meant to own a stereo were planted way back then, because the original audiophiles were people who were baby boomers' fathers and mothers,"" he says. ""As rock 'n' roll starts to become more of a thing, a lot of that stuff is produced so it's meant to be heard on AM radios."" A Phil Spector Wall of Sound production -- in glorious mono! -- would probably have driven a hi-fi enthusiast up a wall, says Milner. The mass market moves on . In the '70s and '80s, the twain did meet, for a time. Rock and pop music production techniques improved. At the same time, grown-up baby boomers, now working adults, invested in better audio equipment, all the better to listen to Steely Dan's ""Aja."" There were whole mass-market stores devoted to audio gear -- Sound Trek, Hi-Fi Buys, Silo -- and no issue of Rolling Stone was complete without several ads for turntables, cassette decks and equalizers. But technology marched on, and so did change. Some was for the sake of convenience: Cassettes had more hiss and less range than LPs, but were more portable -- especially when listening on your handy Walkman or boombox. However, we also started focusing more on visuals. Penchansky traces the decline of the stereo system to the early '80s rise of the music video, which brought visuals to the fore. Suddenly, the concert hall in your living room -- or the audio imaging in your head -- was gone, replaced by surrealist pictures overwhelming the television's tiny speaker. That branch of consumption has helped lead to the home theater. Penchansky has nothing against HDTVs and 7.1 systems, but believes that, for the most part, it's a ""sonic compromise."" With a pure audio system, ""There was no way that television, even today, simulates the realism of visual experience the way (good) audio can simulate an audio experience."" Sure, technology has adjusted. New materials and processing technology have improved the sound of small and inexpensive devices, says Patrick Lavelle, president and CEO of the consumer electronics giant VOXX International, which manufactures such brands as Klipsch, Acoustic Research and Advent. Headphones and an iPod . And there's still a consumer market for good audio, adds Geir Skaaden, an executive at the high-definition audio company DTS. The top-selling products in Apple Stores, after Apple's own devices, are headphones, he says. (DTS recently introduced technology for an immersive system called Headphone:X, intended for mobile devices.) Still, convenience still rules. Which means it's out with the component stereo system and in with the computer. That suits Rubio, the Emory graduate, fine. He grew up in a house with a component system but doesn't believe he's missing anything. ""All you need is a good pair of headphones and an iPod and that's pretty much it,"" he says. Milner, the author, can't question his decision. ""Now, why even bother?"" he asks. ""If you can take your entire music collection and more in something that fits in your pocket, why would you not do that?""","For decades, the component stereo system was the way to listen to audio .
Now it's all about computers and MP3 devices .

"(CNN) -- Far beneath our feet, amazing caverns yawn and twist. The heart of anyone who stumbles on one must race with the thrill of discovery as well as a terror of encountering creatures in the dark. Formed by geological processes over thousands of years, caves in the United States were often used by Native Americans well before Europeans arrived. Though mapped, excavated and fitted with lights and guard rails, ""show caves"" -- those open to the public for tours -- are still fascinating to explore, especially when the sun burns hot above. Underground streams, spectacular rock formations and cool, consistent temperatures of about 44 F to 56 F (about 7 F to 13 C) lure visitors underground. Here are eight spectacular U.S. caves: . Carlsbad Caverns . Carlsbad, New Mexico . The most famous of America's underground destinations is the 46,000-acre Carlsbad Caverns National Park in New Mexico. Visitors can take a self-guided tour of the main rooms, or a ranger-led foray into creepily named niches such as the Hall of the White Giant, the Rookery and Spider Cave. Speaking of creepy, swarms of bats make a great show for visitors during summertime, leaving the cave each evening and returning in the early hours; call the park (575-785-3012) for exact times to watch their flight. Entrance fee is $10 for adults, free for children 15 and under. Guided tours are extra and vary in difficulty, length and age requirements. For guided tour reservations, call 877-444-6777 or visit recreation.gov. Glenwood Caverns . Glenwood Springs, Colorado . In the 1890s, the Fairy Caves in Glenwood Springs became some of the first caves in the world lit with electric lights. Following an 82-year closure, they reopened in 1999, and today visitors ride gondolas up a 4,300-foot tramway to the entrance. The original Fairy Caves, which contain nooks such as the Exclamation Point lookout and Eternal Towers underground canyon, were damaged by exposure early on but are undergoing gradual restoration. The fully preserved Glenwood Caverns section can be seen on foot or via a more challenging crawling tour. Glenwood Caverns Adventure Park also offers thrill rides such as roller coasters and the Giant Canyon Swing. Entrance and cave tour are $25 for adults, $20 for children; Wild Cave Tour $60. 800-530-1635; www.glenwoodcaverns.com . Luray Caverns . Luray, Virginia . At Luray Caverns in the Shenandoah Valley you'll find resplendent limestone formations, cascading like endless dollops of rich ice cream. They're also reminiscent of giant church organs, and in the 1950s mathematician Leland Sprinkle rigged up the Great Stalacpipe Organ, a contraption with mallets that strike stalactites to produce an otherworldly sound. It's played for every tour by an automated system. Admission -- including tour and entrance to Luray Valley Museum -- is $29 adults, $17 children 6-12 and free for children 5 and under. Tickets to a Garden Maze and Rope Adventure Park on site can be bought separately. 540-743-6551; www.luraycaverns.com . Howe Caverns . Howes Cave, New York . In a pasture 40 miles west of Albany in 1842, Lester Howe noticed his cows gathered on a spot where cool breezes could be felt. His investigations led him into dark recesses extending 15 stories below ground, including a subterranean lake extending for a quarter mile. Contemporary visitors to Howe Caverns can take a 90-minute walking tour with boat ride, a two-hour lantern tour that recreates the lighting of Howe's early descents, or a two-hour spelunking tour. The traditional tour is $25 adults, $13-$21 for children 5-15 and free for children under 5. Reservations are required on lantern and spelunking tours, which are $35 and $108, respectively, and have age and fitness requirements. Outside attractions such as a rock wall, air jumper and ropes course are ticketed separately. 518-296-8900; www.howecaverns.com . Niagara Cave . Harmony, Minnesota . Like Niagara Falls, Niagara Cave has made a name for itself as a home for romance and matrimony: Its underground wedding chapel has been the site of more than 400 nuptials. Located in Minnesota's Amish country southeast of the Twin Cities, the cave also boasts a 60-foot waterfall. Well-preserved marine fossils dating back hundreds of millions of years are another highlight of the hourlong tour, which costs $14 for adults, $8 for children 4-12, and is free for children 3 and under. 800-837-6606; www.niagracave.com . Oregon Caves . Cave Junction, Oregon . Nicknamed ""the Marble Halls of Oregon,"" the Oregon Caves National Monument is one of the few marble caverns to be found. It features rooms such as Paradise Lost, the Ghost Room and Banana Grove; an underground stream called the River Styx; and hunger-inducing formations named for popcorn, bacon and soda straws. Discovered by a 19th-century bear hunter, the cave contains the 50,000-year-old remnants of a grizzly, among other fossils. Tours are $8.50 for adults, $6 for 16 and under. Children must be 42 inches or taller to take part in the 90-minute guided cave tour, which covers 500 stairs and climbs 230 feet. Spelunking tours are available by reservation for $30 per person. 541-592-2100; www.nps.gov/orca . Marengo Cave . Marengo, Indiana . Accounts of Marengo Cave's discovery differ in their details, but the story of a young brother and sister who ventured in with candles in 1883 is enchanting enough to be represented on the attraction's logo. Choose from a 40- or 60-minute guided walking tour; the latter takes in the Penny Ceiling, an upside-down wishing well where coins tossed upward stick to thick silt. Tours are $14.50-$16.50 for adults, $8-$9 for children 12 and under. Also: cave exploring tours for $29-$99 per person and canoe trips on the nearby Blue River. 888-702-2837; www.marengocave.com . Penn's Cave . Centre Hall, Pennsylvania . Don't feel like trekking? Consider Penn's Cave, where you cruise along an underground stream, watching trout swim below and formations drift by. One stalagmite is dubbed ""the Statue of Liberty,"" but these caves were known well before that landmark was built. A fanciful legend describes an 18th-century French trapper who eloped with the Indian maiden Nita-Nee against Indian custom and was left to perish in the cave's far reaches. Tours cost $17.50 for adults, $9.25 for children 2-12, children under 2 free. Combination tickets also cover a bus tour of the adjacent wildlife park. 814-364-8778; www.pennscave.com . .","Formations at Virginia's Luray Caverns are reminiscent of giant church organs .

"Japan's military scrambled fighters Thursday after two Russian SU-27 jets entered Japanese airspace off Rishiri Island near the tip of Japan's northernmost Hokkaido Island, according to the country's Defense Ministry. The Russian jets left Japanese airspace without incident after a little more than a minute, the ministry said. The incident occurred near territory disputed by Japan and Russia since the end of World War II. Japanese officials lodged an official protest with Russia over the incident, Japan's Kyodo news service reported. Russian officials denied their jets entered Japanese airspace, the Russian Interfax news agency reported. The incident is the first since 2008, Kyodo reported. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has made a priority of resolving the longstanding dispute with Russia over what it calls the Northern Territories and Russia calls the Kuril Islands, according to Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun. Russia and Japan have squabbled over the islands -- Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan and Habomai -- since the end of WWII, when Russian forces took over the islands, according to the Japanese Foreign Affairs Ministry. Because of the dispute, the two countries never signed a peace treaty following the war.

"(CNN)It's said that lending to friends is a good way to lose them, but how about lending to a complete stranger? Since the world economies went into a tailspin in 2008, getting a bank loan has gotten harder. But it's also opened up the market for others to step in. Welcome to peer-to-peer lending, a platform where people lend money to each other over the internet. ""You can get actually a better deal by looking at people around you, looking at your community,"" says Soul Htite, the founder and CEO at Dianrong, a peer-to-peer lending company based in Shanghai. Acting as a broker between lenders and borrowers, peer-to-peer lenders say they can offer a better rate to both sides without the weight of regulation and the expensive branches that typically make high street banks so cautious. For many, these platforms are shaping up as the future of banking. ""I doubt that people born today are ever going to have a bank account the same way you and I have a bank account,"" Htite told CNN. ""I think we're going to see the banking world completely transform."" China is home to the biggest rise in peer-to-peer lending and Dianrong claims to be growing at a massive 20% each month. It fits well in China where people will typically first approach relatives for any large-scale loan. China's state lenders are also notoriously regulation-bound and cumbersome, meaning that for many 'shadow banking' and, now, peer-to-peer platforms are the only way to get small and medium-sized businesses off the ground. Peter Renton, a peer-to-peer blogger who recently made a foray into investing raising $28 million this year for Lend Academy Investments LLC, regularly writes for an audience of 20,000 on his website that provides news and advice on peer-to-peer lending. In the United States, peer-to-peer groups such as LendingClub and Prosper allow borrowers to apply for loans of as much as US$35,000 payable over three or five years. The companies use technology to do due diligence. When a borrower is accepted, the loans are listed on the websites calling on institutions and individuals to back them. Initially, the P2P platforms attracted retail investors, but increasingly big institutions and hedge funds have become interested in the platform. Companies such as have LendingClub currently projects returns of between 5.4% and 9.4%. ""It's funny because it's sort of come full circle,"" Renton said. ""Banks are now participating in P2P lending. ""It's very simple, it's very fast. Really, you can do it in your pajamas at two in the morning. That is the beauty from the borrower perspective. ""From the investor perspective, it's for the first time ever, people have been able to invest money in their fellow citizens.""","Acting as a broker between lenders and borrowers, peer-to-peer lenders say they can offer a better rate to both sides .

"Hundreds of onlookers crowded around a booth inside the cavernous Las Vegas Convention Center, hoisting cameras overhead and straining for a glimpse of the woman with the tiny frame and the big fake eyelashes: . Snooki. The ""Jersey Shore"" star, more officially but less-well known as Nicole Polizzi, was at the International Consumer Electronics Show here Tuesday to promote a forthcoming line of headphones for iHip, a company that makes audio accessories. Less than 200 yards away, a similar throng jammed the SMS Audio booth, where hip-hop star 50 Cent was appearing on behalf of his own brand of headphones. And on Wednesday, pop singer Justin Bieber was scheduled to appear at a CES event for TOSY, a robotics company that's unveiling an ""entertainment robot."" These celebrity endorsements can certainly make headlines at CES (witness this article). But will they translate into sales? In recent years, celebs have a mixed track record when it comes to launching tech gadgets. Musician Dr. Dre has had success with Beats, his popular line of high-performance headphones. But singer Lady Gaga showed up at last year's CES to unveil a prototype of camera-equipped Polaroid sunglasses that never reached the market. ""They definitely help attract people to the booth. You see people all crowding around the booth, and they're not looking at the new Bluetooth headset or whatever, they're taking pictures of the celebrity,"" said gadget analyst Andrew Eisner of Retrevo, the consumer-electronics site. ""It's Vegas -- it's showtime. But whether it carries any weight (beyond CES), I don't know."" A celebrity tech endorsement makes the most sense, Eisner said, if the person has some expertise about the product -- witness all the musical artists (Ludacris also is at CES, as he was last year, with a line of headphones) creating signature audio equipment. That's something 50 Cent understands. ""It actually speaks to what I do for a living -- making music,"" he told CNN in reference to his headphone venture. His product line, the wireless Sync by 50 ($399) and the wired Street by 50 ($299), hit the market last month. The rapper also understands that some star wattage can bring attention to a gadget that might otherwise get lost in the sea of gadgets here. ""CES is exciting,"" he said. ""But so many amazing things don't have proper marketing in place yet, so people won't get a chance to see them."" Back at the iHip booth, Snooki sat at a table and smiled patiently while fans lined up for autographs and photos. She wore a leopard-print top, a short skirt and five-inch heels, and fiddled with her white iPhone between visitors. Sometimes, she sang along to the dance music being spun by the event's DJ. Snooki was not available for interviews. But iHip spokeswoman Amanda Breault said the company approached the reality TV star to help build buzz around its products. ""We built the line around the things that she likes, like animal prints and bling. She designed everything to fit her attitude and her fashion sense,"" Breault said. ""We knew that by having her, we could instantly attract fans, sponsors, press. The response has been tremendous.""","""Jersey Shore"" star attracts crowds at CES promoting line of headphones for iHip .

"The Cold War aerial games of chicken portrayed in the movie ""Top Gun"" are happening in real life again nearly 30 years later. A U.S. Air Force spy plane evaded an encounter with the Russian military on July 18, just a day after Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was downed by a suspected surface-to-air missile that Ukraine and the West allege was fired by pro-Russia rebels in eastern Ukraine. The RC-135 Rivet Joint fled into nearby Swedish airspace without that country's permission, a U.S. military official told CNN. The airplane may have gone through other countries' airspace as well, though it's not clear if it had permission to do so. The U.S. plane had been flying in international airspace, conducting an electronic eavesdropping mission on the Russian military, when the Russians took the unusual action of beginning to track it with land-based radar. The Russians then sent at least one fighter jet into the sky to intercept the aircraft, the U.S. official said Saturday. The spy plane crew felt so concerned about the radar tracking that it wanted to get out of the area as quickly as possible, the official said. The quickest route away from the Russians took them into Swedish airspace. The U.S. official acknowledged that was done without Swedish military approval. As a result of this incident, the United States is discussing the matter with Sweden and letting officials know there may be further occurrences where American jets have to divert so quickly they may not be able to wait for permission. ""We acknowledge a U.S. aircraft veered into Swedish airspace and will take active steps to ensure we have properly communicated with Swedish authorities in advance to prevent similar issues before they arise,"" the U.S. State Department said. The incident was first reported by the Swedish news agency Svenska Dagbladet. Russian officials did not provide any immediate reaction about the encounter. This was at least the second potentially-dangerous encounter between a U.S. plane and Russia over the past few months. On April 23, a Russian Su-27 Flanker fighter jet buzzed within 100 feet of the nose of a U.S. Air Force RC-135U reconnaissance plane over the Sea of Okhotsk between Russia and Japan, a Defense Department official said. Russian fighter jet nearly collided with U.S. military plane in April . Russian and U.S. aircraft often encounter each other, both in Northern Europe as well as the area between the Russian Far East and Alaska. But the official said the land radar activity by the Russians in this instance was unusual. The ongoing civil unrest in Ukraine and the downing of MH 17 over eastern Ukraine on July 17, which killed all 298 people aboard, have heightened tensions between Washington and Moscow.  Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was brought down by a suspected missile. Pro-Russia rebels have denied allegations from Ukraine and the West that they shot down the Malaysian airliner, or that Russia supplied equipment used to shoot it down.","U.S. military official tells CNN the incident occurred on July 18 .

"(CNN) -- A nurse's aide in Spain catches Ebola; her dog is taken away and put to death. A nurse in Texas catches Ebola; her dog is fed, taken away and put into quarantine. The stark difference in treatment illustrates the lack of solid protocol on what to do with Ebola victims' pets -- and highlights what little is known about the risk. Why are we even talking about this? Focusing on the cases of two dogs can seem trivial compared to the 4,000 people in West Africa who have died from Ebola this year. But CNN's Anderson Cooper notes that concern about animals can have a broader impact on human health. ""We've seen this in disasters before, people not wanting to leave their homes because they couldn't bring their animals to a shelter,"" he said. ""The fear among health care workers and CDC officials and others is that if people are afraid that their dogs are going to be killed, they might not come forward if they're starting to show some symptoms."" So, can pets get or spread Ebola? ""At this time, there have been no reports of dogs or cats becoming sick with Ebola or of being able to spread Ebola to people or other animals,"" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. Some studies have shown that dogs may experience asymptomatic Ebola infections, the CDC says -- meaning they may have the virus but don't get sick. Also, the agency says, human infections haven't been linked to dogs. ""The risk activities that lead to human infections are direct contact with infected human body fluids, or through bats or consumption of infected wild meat."" But it's not yet clear whether a pet's body, paws or fur can pick up and spread Ebola to people or other animals. Biology professor David Sanders said some animals, like fruit bats, can carry the virus without showing any symptoms and could infect others. ""The concept that viruses in animals can be transmitted to humans and can have potential harmful consequences, that's obvious,"" said Sanders who teaches at Purdue University. ""So infected animals that are not showing signs of infection can potentially be capable of transferring virus to humans."" Do we really need to worry about pets getting Ebola? Not at all, said Dr. William Schaffner, chair of preventative medicine at Vanderbilt University. ""It is not a danger. We're not concerned,"" Schaffner told CNN's State of the Union with Candy Crowley. ""We know that this virus can circulate in animals, but pets have not been a feature of Ebola spread, whether in Africa and certainly not here in the developed world,"" he said. ""We all thought that the attention in Spain to the dog of the person who was ill was ill-advised and was a distraction."" So why did the dog in Spain have to die? More than 400,000 people signed an online petition asking Spanish authorities to spare the life of Excalibur, the dog of nursing aide Teresa Romero Ramos. Romero is in critical condition after helping treat an infected Spanish missionary. But Madrid health authorities insisted they had to euthanize Excalibur in case the canine had Ebola. Critics said the dog should have been quarantined, just like Romero's husband has been. What about the nurse's dog in Texas? Bentley, the dog belonging to infected Texas nurse Nina Pham, is now safe with Dallas Animal Services and Adoption Center and was taken Tuesday to Hensley Field, a decommissioned Naval Air base that's now owned by the city. He'll be monitored at the former military complex where he's been given bedding and toys to keep him comfortable. ""Bentley is in a safe place, away from hoomes, apartments and other animals,"" the City of Dallas said.","CDC: There have been no reports of pets getting sick with Ebola or spreading it .

"When you're a patient, you trust you're in good hands, but even the best doctor or nurse can make a mistake on you or someone you love. ""Mistakes are happening every day in every hospital in the country that we're just not catching,"" says Dr. Albert Wu, an internist at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Medical errors kill more than a quarter million people every year in the United States and injure millions. Add them all up and ""you have probably the third leading cause of death"" in the country, says Dr. Peter Pronovost, an anesthesiologist and critical care physician at Johns Hopkins Hospital. The harm is often avoidable, and there are strategies you can use to help doctors and nurses get things right. Here's a list of 10 shocking medical mistakes and ways to not become a victim: . 1. Mistake: Treating the wrong patient            • Cause: Hospital staff fails to verify a patient's identity.           • Consequences: Patients with similar names are confused.           • Prevention: Before every procedure in the hospital, make sure the staff checks your entire name, date of birth and barcode on your wrist band.           • Example case: Kerry Higuera . 2. Mistake: Surgical souvenirs     • Cause: Surgical staff miscounts (or fails to count) equipment used inside a patient during an operation.     • Consequences: Tools get left inside the body.     • Prevention: If you have unexpected pain, fever or swelling after surgery, ask if you might have a surgical instrument inside you.     • Example case: Nelson Bailey . 3. Mistake: Lost patients     • Cause: Patients with dementia are sometimes prone to wandering.     • Consequences: Patients may become trapped while wandering and die from hypothermia or dehydration.     • Prevention: If your loved one sometimes wanders, consider a GPS tracking bracelet.     • Example case: Mary Cole . 4. Mistake: Fake doctors     • Cause: Con artists pretend to be doctors.     • Consequences: Medical treatments backfire. Instead of getting better, patients get sicker.     • Prevention: Confirm online that your physician is licensed.     • Example case: Sarafina Gerling . 5. Mistake: The ER waiting game     • Cause: Emergency rooms get backed up when overcrowded hospitals don't have enough beds.     • Consequences: Patients get sicker while waiting for care.     • Prevention: Doctors listen to other doctors, so on your way to the hospital call your physician and ask them to call the emergency room.     • Example case: Malyia Jeffers . 6. Mistake: Air bubbles in blood     • Cause: The hole in a patient's chest isn't sealed airtight after a chest tube is removed.     • Consequences: Air bubbles get sucked into the wound and cut off blood supply to the patient's lungs, heart, kidneys and brain. Left uncorrected the patient dies.     • Prevention: If you have a central line tube in you, ask how you should be positioned when the line comes out.     • Example case: Blake Fought7. Mistake: Operating on the wrong body part     • Cause: A patient's chart is incorrect, or a surgeon misreads it, or surgical draping obscures marks that denote the correct side of the operation.     • Consequences: The surgeon cuts into the wrong side of a patient's body.     • Prevention: Just before surgery, make sure you reaffirm with the nurse and the surgeon the correct body part and side of your operation.     • Example case: Jesse Matlock8. Mistake: Infection infestation     • Cause: Doctors and nurses don't wash their hands.     • Consequences: Patients can die from infections spread by hospital workers.     • Prevention: It may be uncomfortable to ask, but make sure doctors and nurses wash their hands before they touch you, even if they're wearing gloves.     • Example case: Josh Nahum . 9. Mistake: Lookalike tubes     • Cause: A chest tube and a feeding tube can look a lot alike.     • Consequences: Medicine meant for the stomach goes into the chest.     • Prevention: When you have tubes in you, ask the staff to trace every tube back to the point of origin so the right medicine goes to the right place.     • Example case: Alicia Coleman . 10. Mistake: Waking up during surgery     • Cause: An under-dose of anesthesia.     • Consequences: The brain stays awake while the muscles stay frozen. Most patients aren't in any pain but some feel every poke, prod and cut.     • Prevention: When you schedule surgery, ask your surgeon if you need to be put asleep or if a local anesthetic might work just as well.     • Example case: Erin Cook .

"More details about the presumably imminent release of the next iPhone have emerged, if the typically anonymous spate of Internet sources are to be believed. iMore, the first blog to publish reports that Apple plans to unveil its latest iteration of the smartphone on September 12, is now saying that pre-orders will begin that day and that the phone will be released nine days later, on September 21. Both reports from the blog cite ""sources that have provided iMore with accurate iPhone related launch dates in the past."" Several other blogs later cited their own sources saying the September 12 date is likely correct. International launches in Europe and elsewhere will begin the first week of October, iMore said, possibly October 5. Apple, to date, has made no official announcement. iPhone speculation has focused on a handful of expected new features, including a slightly larger screen, a smaller dock connector and NFC technology that would make it easier for shoppers to make payments through their phones. There are also varying opinions as to whether CEO Tim Cook might also unveil a smaller ""iPad Mini"" at the event. Once considered a no-go because of late CEO Steve Jobs' statements that a smaller tablet wouldn't work, observers increasingly think Apple could offer one to compete with emerging competitors like Amazon's Kindle Fire and Google's Nexus 7. Current iPhone owners seem convinced that a rollout is imminent. Last week, Ebay reported that it was seeing a surge in the number of people using the site for trade-in offers on their smartphones. The site's ""Instant Sale"" feature, which offers a pre-determined amount for electronics based on what someone else has offered, saw its number of phone trade-in offers jump 70% between July 30 and August 1. That's when the September 12 release-date rumors began circulating.

"The Pakistani foreign minister Sunday described a NATO attack that killed dozens of soldiers as ""totally unacceptable,"" saying it plunges the nation's relationship with the United States into deeper crisis.

The attack wounded 13 others in Mohmand Agency, one of seven districts in the volatile region bordering Afghanistan, the Pakistani foreign ministry said in a statement. Many of the wounded were in critical condition, military officials said. The officials did not want to be identified because they are not allowed to talk to the media. The NATO secretary general said it was a ""tragic unintended"" incident, and pledged  to ensure such attacks don't reoccur. ""NATO remains strongly committed to work with Pakistan to improve cooperation to avoid such tragedies in the future,"" Anders Fogh Rasmussen said in a statement. But the Pakistani foreign minister said the attack violated the nation's sovereignty. ""Such attacks ... demonstrate complete disregard for international law and human life,"" Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar told U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a phone call early Sunday. The minister's office issued a news release describing the conversation. The attack ""negates the progress made by the two countries on improving relations and forces Pakistan to revisit the terms of engagement,"" Khar said. Pakistan shut down two NATO supply routes in response to the attack, military and intelligence officials said. NATO trucks have used the routes, in Khyber Agency and Balochistan, to supply U.S. and international forces fighting in Afghanistan. The foreign minister briefed Clinton on decisions to stop the supply routes, and asked the U.S. to vacate the Shamsi air base within 15 days. NATO and U.S. officials expressed their condolences about the deaths of the Pakistani soldiers, but circumstances surrounding what happened remained unclear. Pakistan said it will reassess its relationship with the United States, NATO and the International Security Assistance Force, marking a major setback in worsening U.S.-Pakistan relations. ""The prime minister will take the Parliament into confidence on the whole range of measures regarding matters relating to Pakistan's future cooperation with US/NATO/ISAF, in the near future,"" Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani's office said in a statement. The incident could be the deadliest for Pakistani soldiers involving NATO since a U.S. airstrike in June 2008, which Pakistan said killed 11 of its forces who were cooperating with the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan. That airstrike, also in Mohmand Agency, prompted Islamabad to summon the U.S. ambassador and lodge an official protest.","NATO secretary general says it was a ""tragic unintended"" incident .

"A federal judge has turned aside calls to publicly release video and photographs of the U.S. military raid and aftermath that left al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden dead. Judicial Watch, a conservative legal group, had asked the Department of Defense to comply with a Freedom of Information request for the material, especially photos of the September 11 mastermind lying dead on the third floor of his Pakistan hideout. The group argued it was being ""irreparably harmed"" by the Obama administration's ""unlawful withholding of requested records."" But Judge James Boasberg ruled Thursday there were legitimate national security interests to deny disclosure. ""A picture may be worth a thousand words. And perhaps moving pictures bear an even higher value,"" said the Washington-based judge. ""Yet, in this case, verbal descriptions of the death and burial of Osama bin Laden will have to suffice, for this court will not order the release of anything more."" Deported bin Laden family members head to Saudi Arabia . Judicial Watch made its initial request the day after the commando assault by Navy SEALs. A similar request for material was filed against the CIA. President Barack Obama had announced that the U.S. government would not reveal any photographs of the May 2, 2011, military action and bin Laden's subsequent burial at sea. Some members of Congress have been allowed to privately view the materials this week. Some al Qaeda-affiliated leaders, along with domestic and foreign websites and blogs, have questioned whether bin Laden was really killed and whether the details of his death released by the administration were accurate. A May 9, 2011, letter from the Pentagon to Judicial Watch -- mentioned in the legal complaint -- stated, ""At this time, we are unable to make a release determination on your request within the 20-day statutory time period"" required by federal law. The legal group had the option of filing an administrative appeal directly with the Defense Department, rather than going for a lawsuit. ""The American people have a right to know, by law, basic information about the killing of Osama bin Laden,"" Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said then. ""Incredibly, the Obama administration told us that it has no plans to comply with the Freedom of Information law, so we must now go to court. President Obama's not wanting to 'spike the football' is not a lawful basis for withholding government documents. This historic lawsuit should remind the Obama administration that it is not above the law."" Obama had barred any public release of photos or video, telling CBS News, ""It is important to make sure that very graphic photos of somebody who was shot in the head are not floating around as an incitement to additional violence or as a propaganda tool."" He added, ""We don't trot this stuff out as trophies. We don't need to spike the football.""

"Even death couldn't part two skeletons excavated from a lost chapel in an English county, found with their fingers entwined. A team of archaeologists from the University of Leicester Archaeological Services (ULAS) are working with volunteers on a four-year excavation project at the site, which overlooks the small village of Hallaton. Vicki Score, ULAS project manager, says the skeletons were placed together in this position, as there was enough room in the grave to have them buried apart. Aside from the bonded couple, 11 skeletons have been found so far, which are yet to be analyzed, but some discoveries have been made already. Score says one was of an older man aged 46 or over who appeared to have been struck on the head with a sharp weapon such as a pole axe. Another, she says, was in his mid-twenties, with teeth showing severe childhood trauma during the first nine years of his life. ""He was buried in a very unusual position in a pit with his legs splayed widely apart, arms flexed at the elbows and hands tucked beneath his chin. ""We have no idea why he was buried like this -- it could possibly be due to a medical condition."" Both skeletons also had lesions on their skulls which suggest they had head lice. The team are hoping to find out more about how the gravesite was chosen. Score says: ""We have seen similar skeletons before from Leicester where a couple has been buried together in a single grave. The main question we find ourselves asking is why were they buried up there?"" It is thought the chapel may have served as a pilgrimage, or the main church possibly refused to bury the bodies because they were criminals, foreigners or diseased. She adds that Roman archaeology beneath the chapel imply that something important already existed there, which made it a special place. Other findings include the walls and tiled floors of the site, fragments of stone masonry, wall plaster, tiles and lead from the windows. Silver pennies dating between the 12th and 16th centuries give clues as to when the chapel was in use. In 2000, the Hallaton Treasure was discovered, consisting of Iron Age coins, parts of Roman helmets and debris from feasting. The county was also where the remains of 15th-century monarch Richard III were uncovered beneath a parking lot in 2012, raising questions about how the controversial ruler lived and died.","Two skeletons were found holding hands, buried at a lost chapel in Leicester .

"A picture of popular Brazilian actress Juliana Paes climbing up onto a roof to catch a kite from the scene of TV soap opera ""Gabriela"" recently went viral online in the country. But the online image had been doctored and instead of a kite, Paes is seen clutching a smartphone and the caption reads: ""I finally got a TIM signal!"" It is an internet joke based on a catalog of complaints by Brazilian consumers against wireless carrier TIM, angry about its patchy coverage. In a survey on its Facebook page in July, Rio de Janeiro-based technology review site, TechTudo, asked: ""Which is the operator with the worst mobile signal?"" TIM, the second largest cell phone company in Brazil, was voted the worst with 2,127 people selecting it. The runner up was Oi with just 337 votes. Meanwhile a spoof video of Brazilian comic Fabio Porchat wearing blue make-up and acting as someone having a nightmare trying to cancel a TIM subscription, has attracted nearly three million views. The Blue Man Group, whose trademark is blue make-up, has done a series of commercials for TIM in Brazil. Brazilian mobile network operators have been in the firing line from the Brazilian telecoms watchdog in recent months following consumer complaints about poor service including calls suddenly disconnecting and customers unable to get a signal. In July, the telecoms regulator Anatel banned three mobile operators from selling new cellphone plans in certain states, telecoms market research firm TeleGeography reported. TIM, the Brazilian subsidiary of Telecom Italia, was barred from 19 states; Oi SA from five; and Telecom Américas (Claro) from three, according to TeleGeography. The ban was lifted in early August. Penetration of mobile subscriptions in Brazil stands at 131%, with 258 million mobile phone users, out of a population of approximately 200 million, but analysts have criticized operators for not investing in infrastructure while riding the mobile boom. According to the World Bank, 98% of the population of Latin America now have a mobile phone signal, with Argentina and Panama in particular seeing an explosive growth in subscriptions. Predictions are that by 2015, at least half of Brazil's population, or 100 million people, will have a mobile phone with internet access. Read related: Seven ways mobile phones have changed lives in Africa . Blogger Anthony Hurtado also thinks that despite having sky-high tariffs on mobiles and too much legislation and regulation, Brazil will soon see a smartphone revolution. Meanwhile the favelas, the illegal settlements in Brazil that spring up on the fringes of urban areas, known as shanty towns, which tend to be crowded, lack basic amenities and sanitation, and have informal market conditions, have experienced their own mobile revolution -- but not always a legitimate one. In the same way that they are havens for ""gatos"" (illegal connections to legal sources of water and electricity), they have become havens for selling and buying stolen handsets as well as special sim cards that allow you to make international calls for free for three months -- known as ""diretão."" These are especially popular among drug barons who run their drugs empires using them, according to Mobile Phone Appropriation in the Favelas of Rio de Janeiro, published in New Media & Society. About 20% of the population of Rio de Janeiro live in favelas, according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics and there are more than 6,000 favelas across Brazil in more than 300 cities. However mobile technology has also been a force for good in them. Brazilian NGO Viva Rio has been running the Viva Favela project since 2001. It started with 20 favela-based community correspondents in Rio and now has more than 300 from across Brazil who produce text, photos, audios and videos about their lives, news and cultural activities for its online magazine and website, read by favela residents. Read related: How the cell phone can improve health care . The cell phone has enabled those residents who cannot read and write well, to participate in the project, by submitting video stories and pictures created on their cell phones -- all at a low-cost as the charity does not have the funds to purchase camcorders, explains Editorial Coordinator of Viva Favela Viktor Chagas. ""Cell phones are a massive platform of inclusion,"" he says. ""With these new technologies there are more and more people producing culture, news and content."" Guilherme Junior, 31, an arts teacher and correspondent for the site, who lives in Bangu, Rio de Janeiro, explains:  ""We have to make an extra effort to create positive news as the newspapers always show only bad things about our communities."" ""We have helped people perceive favelas differently and we have helped favela dwellers identify themselves differently. Favelado had such a pejorative meaning in the 80s and 90s. Now the residents use their identity to strengthen their sense of belonging,"" Chagas adds. Viva Favela also trains the residents in how to make films and take photographs on their cell phones. A photograph and audiovisual workshop that Viva Favela held at the abandoned vandalized movie theater Cine Guaraci in Rocha Miranda in Rio even inspired residents to start a campaign to get it reopened, Chagas says -- and they were recently successful. Read related: Ex-Apple boss tackles poverty in India with mobile technology . The Alô Cidadão! (Hello Citizen!)  project which ran until 2009, enabled low-income residents, who often did not leave their favelas because of gang violence, to subscribe and receive free SMS messages each day about everything from community news, job openings and vaccination drives to cultural events that they otherwise would have missed. It was created by the non-profit Institute Hartmann Regueira (IHR) and funded by Oi Futuro, the social arm of the largest Brazilian telecommunications company Oi and Spring Wireless. The content was generated from local newspapers and partnerships with community groups and businesses. IHR is now looking at rolling out a new project with Oi using a smartphone application to counteract bullying in schools in the Brazilian city of Belo Horizonte. Rede Jovem, another social project, led by NGO Solidaritas, runs Mobile Rede Jovem: SMS for Social Change, which sends daily messages about job opportunities, cultural events, sports, courses and free public services to members of poor communities. It also runs WikiMapa, a program, in which favela residents, known as wiki-reporters, use GPS-enabled camera smartphones, with a WikiMapa mobile application, to map unregistered streets and add photos and videos of local points of interest such as hospitals, churches and stores, taken on their cell phones. These are then uploaded to www.wikimapa.org.br. The project has so far mapped 29 favelas in Rio de Janeiro, funded by Fundación Telefónica, the social investment arm of the Brazilian wireless provider Vivo. Read related: Smartphone explosion liberating China's migrants . Many slums and low-income areas do not exist on official online maps so the initial goal was to add the narrow, winding, often-chaotic, unregistered streets of the favelas onto virtual maps. This had a big impact on the favelados. ""This is the only project that we have to identify and cast good things within one of the slums already considered as the most dangerous in Rio de Janeiro"" says Camila Santos, 26, a wiki-reporter and resident of the Complexo do Alemao favela. ""The sense of marginalization after not even finding a reference to where they lived on virtual maps has been replaced by a twinkle in their eyes now that they can spot their streets and schools among many other used services locally available,"" says Natalia Santos, Executive Director of Rede Jovem. ""The results are a strengthened sense of identity and increased self-esteem,"" she adds.","There has been a rising tide of consumer complaints against network operators in Brazil .

"On paper, the race in Kentucky between Sen. Mitch McConnell and his Democratic challenger, Alison Lundergan Grimes, should be pretty clear-cut: The experienced veteran easily beats a political novice. But like most things, it's not. McConnell must cross the first hurdle by beating his primary challenger, Matt Bevin, before he engages in what is expected to be one of the most expensive and bitterly fought Senate campaigns this midterm season. A lot is at stake overall in November: control of the Senate and the political fate of one of the most powerful Republicans in Washington. Grimes' advantage . Grimes, 35, was just 7 when McConnell was first elected to the Senate. Mitch McConnell would face biggest challenge yet in Alison Grimes . While he rose up the ranks in Washington and became Senate Republican leader, Grimes practiced law and won statewide office as secretary of state in 2011. Despite her short political career, like McConnell, her name carries weight -- for better or worse. Grimes' family has a long history in state Democratic politics. Her father, Jerry, was the former chairman of the Kentucky Democratic Party and a state legislator. But he was forced out of those roles over legal problems facing his catering company. While the family name has been battered, its connections survive: She'll have access to the deep pockets and support of her father's allies, including Bill and Hillary Clinton. The former President has already hit the trail for Grimes, raising more than $600,000 at one Louisville event in February. That was a significant chunk of cash for the one-time, part-time kickboxing instructor, helping to build her war chest for a race that some experts predict could reach $100 million in spending. Grimes has already raised $8 million and she outraised McConnell in two of the past three quarters. Hollywood is among her biggest donors. Ousting the top Senate Republican has attracted national attention. Remember when actress Ashley Judd was rumored to be considering a run? Grimes' political career . But Grimes has built her own credentials in Kentucky politics, Stephen Voss, political science professor at the University of Kentucky in Lexington, said. ""She hasn't made any major errors in her statewide office,"" he said. ""Then again it's also not an office where you can distinguish yourself either."" Her relative inexperience, however, was an issue early on. She was heavily criticized and mocked after her Senate announcement last July. McConnell's campaign team created a video that pointed out that she used her secretary of state campaign banner, had no signs and few supporters in attendance. She also looked like a deer in headlights. While her ""official"" campaign announcement took place 30 days later and ran much more smoothly, Voss said her campaign has so far been ""passive."" 2014 midterms: What's at stake . Even though she announced in July, she didn't release her first television ad until two weeks ago. Voss said her strategy to lay low saved campaign cash, letting McConnell get beat up by his primary opponent. But critics say she missed an opportunity to define herself when the campaign noise was relatively quiet. ""Both she and the McConnell campaign will have a tug-of-war over how she will be defined,"" Voss said. Josh Holmes, senior adviser in McConnell's campaign, did just that in an interview with CNN. ""She was recruited to run by (Senate Democratic Leader) Harry Reid to help Democrats hold onto the Senate, and for most people in Kentucky, that's a pretty easy choice,"" he said. Grimes' campaign defends its strategy, saying the organization has spent its time and money setting up an extensive organization throughout Kentucky that will lead to voter outreach and Election Day votes. On primary night, she is concluding a 10-day, 50-county bus tour, an aggressive attempt to introduce herself to voters across the state, effectively launching her campaign in earnest. The issues . Like Democrats across the country, Grimes is touting her support for an increase of the minimum wage, an issue that is intended to persuade working women to vote on Election Day. Democrats take on the Koch brothers . But politics are still local. Kentucky is the nation's third-largest coal producer and who likes coal more is likely to be a major issue in the race. Grimes says she is a major supporter of coal and her campaign said she opposes the Environmental Protection Agency's carbon limits on power plants. That is a position opposite the one that President Barack Obama and most Democrats in the Senate take. The McConnell campaign is charging hypocrisy as she receives funds from Democrats who support the EPA's stricter standards. But Grimes will paint McConnell as a powerful elected official who stood by and watched coal jobs leave the state. With the general election now on the horizon, Grimes is in a good place. McConnell has low approval numbers and major polls show her about tied with the long-time senator. But as Voss points out, the number of people who don't know who Grimes is or have no opinion about her leaves a blank canvas for her to paint or McConnell to exploit.

"(CNN) -- Five people were killed Thursday after a man tried to attack the Dutch royal family during a Queen's Day celebration by crashing his car near the royal family's bus, Dutch police said. A car is pictured after crashing into the crowd waiting for the visit of the royal family in Apeldoorn. Authorities are not releasing the name of the man, but said they have charged him with with trying to attack the royal family. Twelve people were injured in the incident in the Dutch town of Apeldoorn, about 45 miles east of Amsterdam, police spokeswoman Esther Naber told CNN. Crowds had lined the streets to see Queen Beatrix and her family ride by in an open-top bus during the Netherlands' annual holiday. As the bus moved along, a black hatchback zoomed past it. The crowds were behind barriers off the road, but security officials and journalists, including many cameramen, were in the road as the car went by. The car crashed into the low metal railing around a column on the side of the road. The vehicle appeared heavily damaged even before the crash, but the reason for that was unclear. There was no one other than the driver in the car at the time, Naber said. Members of the royal family saw the crash and gasped, then quickly sat down as the bus continued driving. The driver is in the hospital, badly injured, Naber said. He is among the five seriously hurt -- three men and two women. Queen's Day is a national holiday in the Netherlands, the Netherlands Antilles, and Aruba. The tradition started in 1885 and celebrates the birthday of the queen. Although Queen Beatrix's birthday is January 31, she officially celebrates her birthday April 30, according to the Dutch government. Queen's Day is known for its free market all over the country, where anybody is allowed to sell things in the streets. Other activities include children's games and musical performances.

"The government is proposing to bribe communities with cheaper energy bills in exchange for dropping opposition to local fracking projects as part of plans to push ahead with shale-gas extraction. Several options to cajole rural England to accept the contentious drilling schemes are being discussed as ministers prepare to announce that the UK's shale-gas reserves are much larger than previously estimated. Fracking, an extraction technique that involves pumping water, sand and chemicals at high pressure into shale rock to release trapped pockets of oil and gas, has transformed the US energy market, triggering a production boom that pushed gas prices to 10-year lows last year. Environmentalists worry that the process can pollute ground water and cause emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. The government's paper on ""community benefits"" will propose policies that aim to persuade locals to drop their resistance to fracking in northwest and southeast England, where the largest shale-gas deposits are found. The biggest incentive being discussed by the coalition is cheaper household energy bills for people in the area, according to those familiar with the discussions. Neighbourhoods could also be offered funding for new sports clubs or community centres and other projects to improve local amenities. The House of Commons energy select committee said on Friday that communities affected by shale-gas projects ""should expect to receive, and share in, some of the benefits of development"". It suggested that local authorities hosting shale ventures should also be allowed to retain business rates. The system would be similar to the ""planning gain"" whereby councils that give planning permission to property developments can force the developer to pay for certain infrastructure improvements, such as roads and schools. A separate paper will make a similar proposal for new wind farms. The government could still face big protests against fracking sites, reminiscent of the widespread grassroots Tory hostility to onshore wind turbines and to the HS2 high-speed railway. One Conservative MP, Laura Sandys, has said that planning applications for shale-gas drilling will ""make onshore wind farms look like a walk in the park"". Britain's only fracking operation, by Cuadrilla Resources near Blackpool, was suspended after two minor earthquakes in 2011. It was allowed to resume last December. Last year, the government commissioned the British Geological Survey to produce a new estimate of Britain's shale-gas reserves, which is understood to show that they are much larger than previously thought.","Ministers prepare to announce UK's shale-gas reserves are much larger than previously estimated .

"A teenager tackled by a vice principal refused to drop the knives he'd used to stab 21 at his Pittsburgh-area high school, saying, ""My work is not done, I have more people to kill,"" according to a criminal complaint released Friday. While some underwent surgery, none of the 20 fellow students and one adult stabbed died. Two victims -- one in critical but stable condition, the other in fair condition -- were still at Forbes Regional Hospital in Monroeville, Pennsylvania, on Friday, hospital spokesman Jesse Miller said. Their alleged attacker -- 16-year-old Alex Hribal -- was eventually disarmed, handcuffed and taken into custody. On Friday, Westmoreland County District Attorney John Peck told CNN that Hribal is charged with 21 counts of attempted homicide, in addition to 21 counts of aggravated assault and having a weapon on school property. Hribal was denied bond after the new charges were filed, Murrysville police Sgt. Charles Tappe said. Hribal remains in Westmoreland County's juvenile detention center, even though he has been charged as an adult. The teenager stands accused of rampaging through the halls of Franklin Regional Senior High School early on the morning of April 9, using a pair of 8-inch kitchen knives  to slash those in his path. His parents and classmates insisted afterward that they didn't see the horror coming, with lawyer Patrick Thomassey describing him as a well-liked and ""typical young kid"" who had ""never been been in trouble."" Who is Alex Hribal? Authorities looking through his locker found ""a document"" -- dated April 6, three days before the mass stabbing -- signaling Hribal's intentions to kill, according to the criminal complaint. One part of it read: ""I can't wait to see the priceless and helpless looks on the faces of the students of one of the 'best schools in Pennsylvania' realize their previous lives are going to be taken by the only one among them that isn't a plebeian."" Franklin Regional Senior High indeed has a strong academic reputation. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, its students' average SAT scores for 2013 was 1603. The school is located in the middle-class enclave of Murrysville, a community of about 20,000 people located roughly 20 miles east of Pittsburgh. In less than five minutes, the scene at the school transformed from a regular morning to sheer terror, as students bled, screamed and -- in a few notable cases -- rallied to help one another. The rampage ended when Assistant Principal Sam King spotted the suspect holding the knives, as well as as a security guard, Sgt. John Resetar, bleeding nearby. Assistant principal who tackled suspect hailed as 'great man' According to the criminal complaint citing the school administrator, Hribal was ""facing Resetar (when King) grabbed the accused from behind and took him to the floor.""","Hribal is denied bond, continues to be held, police sergeant says .

"""This is a student at Sparks Middle School. Can you please send police out here? There's a kid with a gun."" ""Somebody brought a gun to school. They shot a teacher."" ""I got a kid down who's been shot."" As police tried to piece together how and why a seventh-grader shot and killed a teacher and wounded two other students at his Nevada school, recordings of the first calls to police captured the horror and chaos he unleashed. The 12-year-old boy, whose name has not been released, began by shooting a fellow student in the shoulder, police said Tuesday. Then he turned his gun on math teacher Mike Landsberry before shooting a second student in the abdomen, Washoe County School District Police Chief Mike Mieras said. After that, he shot himself to death with his pistol, which Sparks Deputy Police Chief Tom Miller identified as a Ruger 9mm semiautomatic. ""We got a guy with a gun. He's down from a head shot wound. Could be our shooter,"" one of the responding officers is heard telling dispatchers on the 911 calls. ""He's out there on the basketball court."" Landsberry walked toward the shooter on a playground basketball court after the first student was hit, saving lives, according to authorities. ""Mr. Landsberry's heroic actions, by stepping toward the shooter, allowed time for other students in the playground area to flee,"" Mieras said. Despite previous reports indicating the two wounded students had been shot inside the school building, all the shots were fired outside, police said. Miller, who said earlier on CNN's ""New Day"" that it wasn't yet clear if the boy was targeting specific people, declined to identify the boy out of respect for his family. ""They are grieving parents and are going through"" a challenging, difficult time, Miller said. 'I think he took out his bullying' Authorities haven't said why they believe the boy opened fire. Many have speculated that bullying might have played a role, 13-year-old Kyle Nucum told CNN's ""The Lead."" That could be the case, said Nucum, a student at Sparks Middle School who didn't know the shooter but ran for cover after seeing him shoot Landsberry. As he fled, he heard the shooter shouting. ""He was yelling a bunch of things while we were running,"" Nucum said. ""He was yelling stuff like, 'Why are you laughing at me? Why are you doing this to me?'"" Before Monday morning, the boy seemed like the antithesis of a school shooter. ""He was really a nice kid,"" schoolmate Amaya Newton said. ""He would make you smile when you were having a bad day."" But for whatever reason, the boy took his parents' handgun to school, a federal law enforcement source said. Miller said Tuesday that authorities aren't positive where the gun came from, but believe it belonged to the boy's parents. Amaya said she thought the two wounded students were friends of the shooter. They were in stable condition with non-life-threatening injuries Monday night, Miller said. Authorities have not released the wounded boys' names. Investigators haven't determined what prompted the shooting. Miller said only that police are exploring all avenues. Amaya said she ""saw him getting bullied a couple of times, and I think he took out his bullying."" Surviving Afghanistan, but not school . The teacher who died, Mike Landsberry, appeared to be trying to stop the incident when he was shot dead, Miller said Tuesday. ""It almost appears like he tried to talk him down,"" he said. Slain Nevada teacher 'put his life on the line' True to his character, the former Marine, a popular math teacher at Sparks Middle School, rushed to help others when the shots erupted. ""That was the kind of person that Michael was,"" said his brother, Reggie Landsberry. ""He was the kind of person that if somebody needed help, he would be there."" Landsberry was an Alabama native who graduated from high school in Reno, next door to Sparks, in 1986. After his stint in the Marine Corps, he got an education degree from the University of Nevada in Reno. He joined the Air National Guard in 2001, rising to the rank of master sergeant and serving as a cargo specialist in Kuwait and Afghanistan, the Guard said. A Facebook memorial page for the teacher had more than 10,000 ""likes"" by early Tuesday. Thousands more honored him on a ""Rest Easy Mr. Landsberry"" page. Teacher killed in Nevada school shooting was 'good all-around guy' Returning to a national debate . The Nevada shooting comes almost a year after a gunman killed 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, igniting a nationwide debate over gun violence and school safety. Since the Newtown shootings last December, proposed school security plans across the country have included arming teachers, adding armed security guards and bringing in bulletproof backpacks and white boards. Some teachers have started taking self-defense and combat classes in case a shooter enters their school. One class teaches how to escape or take cover but focuses most of its four hours on how to fight and disarm an attacker -- something few educators have ever considered how to do. Meanwhile, reports of school violence have continued. Last week, a student at an Austin, Texas, high school killed himself in front of other students. In August, a student at a high school in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, shot and wounded another student in the neck. Another shooting took place at an Atlanta-area middle school in January, though no one was hit. That same month, a California high school student wounded two people, one seriously. Teachers train to face school shooters . The mother of a student killed in Newtown said Monday's shooting reinforces the need to find solutions to keep students safe. ""The unthinkable has happened yet again, this time in Sparks, Nevada,"" Nicole Hockley said in a written statement. ""It's moments like this that demand that we unite as parents to find common sense solutions that keep our children -- all children -- safe, and prevent these tragedies from happening again and again."" But what those solutions are will remain fuel for ongoing debate.","Witness: Shooter yelled, ""Why are you laughing at me?""

"On Monday, a U.N. official said that Syrian rebels had likely used the nerve agent sarin. Carla Del Ponte, the veteran war crimes prosecutor and a commissioner of the U.N. Independent International Commission of Inquiry for Syria, made this claim on a Swiss-Italian TV station. Del Ponte explained, ""Our investigators have been in neighboring countries interviewing victims, doctors and field hospitals and, according to their report of last week which I have seen, there are strong, concrete suspicions but not yet incontrovertible proof of the use of sarin gas, from the way the victims were treated."" Del Ponte added, ""This was used on the part of the opposition, the rebels, not by the government authorities."" The U.N. commission later pedaled back from Del Ponte's statement, saying that it ""has not reached conclusive findings as to the use of chemical weapons in Syria by any parties to the conflict."" The context here, of course, is that President Barack Obama is under pressure to act in Syria because of his tough statement in August that the use of chemical or biological weapons in the Syrian conflict would cross a ""red line."" In the past few weeks, there have been multiple reports that Bashar al-Assad's regime has deployed chemical weapons. (And after Del Ponte's remarks were reported, a U.S. State Department official told CNN that the United States does not have information suggesting that rebels have ""either the capability or the intent to deploy or use such weapons."" But, the source said, the ""facts are not complete"" and efforts to obtain more information are ongoing.) But Del Ponte's statement that the opposition is likely using chemical weapons raises an important issue: How plausible is the use of such weapons by any of the many armed factions that are fighting al-Assad's regime? The most effective Syrian opposition group is widely considered to be al-Nusra Front. The U.S. State Department says that al-Nusra Front is simply a cover name for al Qaeda in Iraq, which has long operated in Iraq and neighboring Syria. It is a worrisome fact that al Qaeda in Iraq is the only al Qaeda franchise ever to have actually used chemical weapons. Al Qaeda in Iraq detonated a series of crude chlorine bombs in Iraq from late 2006 through mid-2007. A study by the New America Foundation found a total of 16 chlorine gas bombings in Iraq, the last of which was in June 2007. On October 21, 2006, al Qaeda in Iraq launched this campaign of chlorine bomb attacks by detonating a car loaded with mortars and chlorine tanks in Ramadi, wounding three Iraqi police officers and a civilian. Such attacks sickened many hundreds of Iraqis, but the victims who died in these assaults did so from the blast of the bombs rather than from inhaling chlorine. U.S. and Iraqi troops successfully killed or captured many of the people in al Qaeda in Iraq who were building the chlorine-laced bombs and captured much of the group's stockpiled chlorine. Charles Faddis, who headed the CIA's operations against al Qaeda in Iraq's chlorine bomb network, told me in 2010: ""There was a lot of effort to secure the chlorine, to get a hold of the tanks, to track these guys down (who were responsible for building the chlorine bombs), to kill them or capture them. Meanwhile, the attacks are not being particularly successful. The people are dying in the blast, but fortunately nobody is dying from chlorine."" There is no evidence that al Qaeda in Iraq stopped its campaign of chlorine bombing because of any qualms about the use of such weapons. Chlorine gas was used by both sides during World War I but was banned by the Geneva Protocol, along with the use of other poison gases, after the end of the war. The use of such weapons has been a matter of some debate within the leadership of al Qaeda. In documents found by the U.S. Navy SEALs who raided Osama bin Laden's compound two years ago in Abbottabad, Pakistan, there was a letter written by bin Laden five days before he was killed in which he urged his followers in Yemen who were considering using ""poison"" to be ""careful of doing it without enough study of all aspects, including political and media reaction."" As we consider the conflicting reports of the use of chemical weapons that have emerged from Syria over the past weeks, it is worth recalling that the al Qaeda affiliate in Syria has in the past used crude chemical weapons on multiple occasions in neighboring Iraq. Also al Qaeda's leaders such as bin Laden have pushed back on the use of such weapons only insofar as their use might damage the image of al Qaeda in the eyes of the Muslim public, not because of international norms that the use of these weapons is beyond the pale.","Official on U.N. commission says Syrian rebel group may have used nerve agent .

"When techno-whiz Seth Owusu left Ghana for the United States in 1991, he had never used a computer before. But two decades later, he's using the power of technology to provide computer literacy to the children of rural Africa, one refurbished computer at a time. Owusu is the founder of the Entire Village Computers Organization (EVCO), a Washington-based charitable organization that donates reconditioned old computers and accessories from the developed world and delivers them to those schools in need in the developing world. ""We try to put the computers there as electronic tools, also as a library, also to a place where not just the school but the entire villages around that school can come in and benefit from the computer,"" says Owusu, who moved to the United States at the age of 24. Underwater cables bring faster internet to West Africa . Growing up under difficult conditions in rural Ghana, Owusu was inspired at a young age by a group of missionaries who visited his school, willing to make a long and difficult journey to help strangers. He says that that incident has motivated him ever since  to try and make a difference in the lives of others. ""It showed me that regardless of how little you have, you can do something for somebody which can be great for their life and their future,"" says Owusu. Since 2004, EVCO says it has built and donated 25 computer labs in village schools and communities in Ghana and Nigeria for a total of 233 computers. The non-profit organization is funded entirely by Owusu, his family and a small pool of committed donors. But besides money, Owusu, who did computer studies in the U.S. and now works for an electronics company in Washington, also dedicates his personal time, putting a lot of hard work on the project that's become his mission in life. Using the monitor-crammed garage of his house in Washington as his base, he tests, fixes and upgrades all the donated computers himself before shipping them to Africa. He says it's all worth it: ""I feel very excited because it takes a lot to do it and finally when you get it done like this it's just joy,"" says Owusu. ""You feel overjoyed because finally you know that you've reached the destination and somebody is going to benefit from all the hard work that you have to put in,"" he adds. Web savvy Africans fuel growth in online shopping . But EVCO goes much further than just shipping hardware to African villages. The group also runs training workshops for teachers and students and provides technical support, maintaining an ongoing relationship with the recipients of their computers. ""When we do the donation, we enter into a three-calendar year agreement with the kids, with the school, to go back and fix them and make sure everything is working for the next three years,"" says Owusu, who runs EVCO with the help of four volunteers in Ghana. The non-profit organization also promotes local involvement and development, trumpeting Owusu's belief that an entire community benefits when computers are introduced in local schools. ""The whole concept about our donation process is first, not just the computers, but getting the entire community involved in the process"" he says. ""That makes them part of the process, so they know the kids are learning and so they can feel proud to have them go to school rather than tell them to go to the farm."" Ghana farmers lose out in gold mining boom . Owusu has visited his native Ghana 11 times after the launch of EVCO -- there, he doesn't only organize computer workshops but he's also giving motivational speeches and raises awareness about issues such as HIV and teenage pregnancy. He says that his goal is to run EVCO as a full-time project and be able to bring his work to many more rural areas across Africa -- he's currently working to implement the project in Sierra Leone but admits that he has had to turn down calls for help from people in other African countries due to funding difficulties and logistics issues. Yet, despite all the difficulties, Owusu is determined to carry on with his dream of introducing the world of computers to children across Africa. He hopes that by re-building old computers, he will also be give them the tools to compete globally. ""If we want to change the world we have to start by changing the people who are going to be the world tomorrow, who are the kids,"" says Owusu. ""So any seed we sow today are what's going to bloom tomorrow to shape our world and make a better world, so anything that you can do, regardless of how little it is, goes toward making the world a better place,"" he adds.","Seth Owusu is the founder of Entire Village Computers Organization .
The charity takes refurbished computers to rural communities in Africa .
It also runs training workshops and provides technical support .

"When Zhou Yuxia, 24, returned to Beijing after studying in the United States, she had real trouble securing a job. She had the right qualifications for the positions she was looking for -- she just wasn't a man. ""I was on a job hunting site and saw this ideal position as a marketing manager. One of the requirements was that I had to be male,"" she told CNN. ""If I am desperate I will apply anyway because I think I am qualified. But I'll send them an extra video outlining why I can do the job despite being female."" This happened a fortnight ago, just weeks after a similar gender discrimination case made headlines in China. Recent graduate Cao Ju took Beijing-based private tutor company Juren Academy to court after they refused to employ her on the basis of being female. The company later settled for 30,000 RMB (US$4,925), in what has been described as the first gender discrimination lawsuit of its kind in the China. 'Important breakthrough' Geoff Crothall from China Labour Bulletin, an NGO that promotes the rights of workers in China, described the Beijing case as ""an important breakthrough."" He says he expects more women to actively challenge discrimination moving forward but cautioned against being too optimistic. ""It is very difficult to get courts in China to accept discrimination cases, as Cao Ju herself experienced,"" Crothall told CNN. ""Very often employers blatantly discriminate because demand for a particular job is very high and they can get away with setting strict and discriminatory stipulations."" Wang Xiao, 28, knows a thing or two about this. Upon graduating from a top Beijing university, she spent a year working as a headhunter. There she was approached by clients who specified only male candidates. Factory-based jobs and those within engineering were two professions commonly demanding male applicants, as were roles that involved travel or working overseas. ""There's a perception that (travel) to certain countries is not safe for women, and also that if a woman is older her priorities will be more home-based, whereas the man's will still be work first,"" she said. Wang experienced discrimination herself upon changing jobs. She was working as a teacher's assistant at a well-established tutorial company in Beijing and when her boss left, he referred Wang to the director as the best person to fill his role. The director, though, wanted a man. Wang lost out to someone more junior than her. ""At my company the high-level positions were usually filled by men,"" she noted. These anecdotes are commonplace. Data in the Third Chinese Women's Social Status Investigation, jointly carried out in 2010 by the All-China Women's Federation (ACWF) and the National Bureau of Statistics of China, revealed that more than 72% of women had a clear perception of ""not being hired or promoted because of gender"" discrimination. Over 75% believed they were dismissed due to marriage and childbirth, with fears that this could worsen as China relaxes its one-child policy. Meanwhile, the federation calculated that urban Chinese women in 2010 earned 0.67 RMB for every 1 RMB men earned, down from 0.78 RMB in 1990. From overt to recessive . Women must also compete amongst themselves. In China, where applicants often attach a photograph to their CVs, there are jobs requiring women to measure up to a certain level of attractiveness. In her book, Buying Beauty: Cosmetic Surgery in China, anthropologist Wen Hua noted the prevalence of job ads with detailed appearance and height requirements for women. The Chinese government itself is guilty of this, she says. ""They are trying to attract the tallest or the prettiest people, because it makes (the government departments) look good,"" Wen wrote. ""The belief that better looks secure better jobs has pushed more and more Chinese college students to spend lavish amounts of money on cosmetic surgery."" She told CNN the situation has changed since her research back in 2006-7, saying there are fewer of these ads around nowadays -- but she is also wary. ""Gender discrimination in employment still widely exists in China's workplace in different ways that are hidden. The discrimination has changed from overt to recessive, whilst the situation might be even worse because hidden prejudice and discrimination against women is harder to avoid and punish."" Leveling the playing field . Some women adapt to the situation. As a teenager, Lin Wanru wanted to be a doctor. Her mother had other plans, telling her that, ""Medicine is not a good profession for a woman to be in -- it will not attract a man."" Instead Lin became a journalist and satisfies herself with writing medical stories. Lin's story touches on a greater phenomenon, namely women are still being engineered to see marriage as their first priority and career as second. Those who fail to conform to this stereotype risk being labeled a ""leftover."" READ MORE: China's 'leftover women' choose to stay single . Zhang Chao is a member of Lean In Beijing, a women's professional development group inspired by Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg's bestselling book Lean In. For her, this attitude is troubling. A 25-year-old HR coordinator in the telecommunications industry, she says that plenty of her female counterparts were ambitious at school and college, but their ambition later disappeared. ""When we step out of school and enter the society, all of the goals turn to the pressure of marrying a good husband. It becomes the major standard of how we evaluate our life,"" she told CNN. This is a far cry from when the Communist Party came to power in 1949, when elevating the status of women was central to their manifesto. Chairman Mao famously declared that women hold up half the sky and, superficially at least, went about promoting women into jobs previously designated to men. But it's not all bad in today's China. According to the 2014 Hurun Global Rich List, 17 of the 358 US-dollar billionaires living in Greater China are women (up from 14 a year ago), and 19% of Chinese women in management positions are CEOs. The perception women are on the rise has even led to the coining of a phrase -- yin sheng, yang shuai -- which means the female (yin) is on the up, while the male (yang) is moving down. Celebrating women the wrong way . The Chinese treatment of International Women's Day, which still features in the Chinese annual calendar on March 8, shows the disparity between rhetoric and reality. Once seen as an occasion to highlight the plight of women, it has now become another commercial opportunity, like Valentine's Day or Mother's Day. Some companies give women time off; others provide presents for their female staff -- often presents that feed into gender stereotypes. In 2013, a total of 1.72 million men bought gifts for women in the 10 days leading up to International Women's Day, according to a report issued by Taobao, China's largest online shopping website. Beauty vouchers and kitchen supplies were a dominant theme. Retailers commonly offer sales on women's products as well. With International Women's Day approaching, the offers are already on display --  bouquets of flowers, and nice accessories to give to your wife, mother or employee. Chinese women are once again being reminded that when it comes to work, there's a gulf between themselves and their male cohorts.","Discrimination against women in rife in China .

"Anthea Raymond no longer has to break the law to kayak on the Los Angeles River. This week, the namesake waterway of the nation's second-largest city opened for unrestricted public recreation for the first time since the 1930s -- when devastating floods prompted officials to close public access to the river and pave its banks with concrete to improve storm drainage, officials said. Raymond was the third person to paddle a 2.5-mile section that's now wide open for public use. Even the name of this stretch of the 51-mile river captures its natural allure: Elysian Valley. ""My experience was, 'wow,'"" said Raymond, who plied the waters as a representative of the Los Angeles River Expeditions and the Los Angeles Kayak Club. ""There's always the sound of water. That's what's so awesome."" Unlike other big city rivers -- such as New York's Hudson River or the Chicago River -- the Los Angeles River is more a seasonal desert waterway: It's flush with rapids during the rain season but becomes a modest stream in the hot summer, slowing to a trickle in some places. Except for guerrilla kayaking by river lovers such as Raymond and others in the expedition club, the concrete-lined river has been strictly off-limits since the Depression era because the river is technically an Army Corps of Engineers flood control channel, officials said. After public pressure and leadership from a local councilman and the corps' commander, officials at several levels of government created the Los Angeles River Pilot Recreation Zone along a lush segment that features tree-lined islands, vistas of the San Gabriel Mountains and abundant wildlife such as herons, egrets, hawks and kingfishers. Oasis parks are colorfully named Rattlesnake, Steelhead and Egret. And, yes, there are even fish in the river -- carp, catfish and bass -- and anglers can drop a line as long as they have a state permit. Opinion: When the audience paddles a canoe to the play . In this recreation zone, the public can launch a kayak, canoe or other nonmotorized boat without a permit or cost, said spokesman Dash Stolarz of the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority, which manages the pilot recreation zone. This soft-bottom portion of the river is also called the Glendale Narrows. The pilot program allows for the open recreation between Memorial Day and Labor Day, a period when local storms are unlikely. Officials expect the program to be renewed in subsequent years, Stolarz said. Accompanied by government officials, kayakers such as Raymond celebrated the river's opening Monday, and her kayak club even made a video. Raymond, who's in her 40s, compared the Los Angeles River to New York City's Hudson and East rivers, where she took up kayaking. New York's rivers are vastly larger and indeed are major commercial corridors, she said. The Los Angeles River, however, has a history of ridicule and neglect: A state legislator in the 1980s wanted to build a highway on it. It's better known as the cinematic home for violence and car chases in films such as ""Grease"" and ""Terminator 2."" In the 1990s, the conservation group American Rivers placed it six times on the list of the country's 20 most threatened and endangered rivers. In 2010, however, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency declared it a ""traditional navigable water,"" allowing for Clean Water Act protections, officials said. The river ultimately ends in the Pacific Ocean at Long Beach, California. Another maiden kayaker this week, Councilman-elect Mitch O'Farrell, almost capsized during his adventure. ""People were downright giddy to get into a kayak on the Los Angeles River,"" he said. ""Even that 2.5-mile has rapids. It takes some concentration. It's a real river. It does take certain risks."" Alissa Walker, a blogger who wrote about her experience Monday, said she was among a small group of enthusiasts who received federal permits last year for trips on another stretch of the river just to prove it was safe. Kayakers earn bragging rights in Green River Narrows . Like others, she hopes officials will open other sections of the river to the public. ""'Cool' is a good word for it,"" Walker said. ""The difference about kayaking here is that we're going under major freeways right in the city. That was the most jarring part of the whole experience. ""You never would have guessed we were in L.A. It was so lush. There were so many birds. And it didn't smell, which many people worried about,"" she said. ""There were a couple parts where we had to get out and hop over a rock because it was pretty shallow."" For the past two years, another portion of the Los Angeles River has been open to kayakers for short periods in the summer, but access was strictly limited under permits from the Army Corps of Engineers. Those tours were on a 1.5-mile section in a 2,000-acre park called the Sepulveda Basin Recreation Area, and the permits sold out in a matter of hours, denying large numbers of river lovers a legal chance to ply the waters. The Elysian Valley section was able to open without restrictions because of government cooperation, infrastructure improvement and public safety measures, said Councilman Ed Reyes, whose district includes the west bank of the river. The city relocated homeless people from riverside encampments, and the bicycling and running trail provides passersby a way to keep an eye on one another, Reyes said. For Reyes, the river opening is a capstone to a long campaign and elected office career. He's entering his last month of his 12-year tenure on the City Council, forced to step down because of term limits. He's now 53, but he recalls illegally swimming in the river and bicycling its banks as a 10-year-old boy with other youths -- until they discovered how filthy the water was, he said. About a decade ago, local AM radio shock jocks mocked Reyes' grand vision to revitalize the river: his school-age daughter even came home upset, Reyes said. But now there's been a shift in the Los Angeles culture and the way Angelenos view themselves. They can truly identify a river in the city, he said. ""They had me in the loony bin talking about my efforts as a mad man,"" Reyes said of the public mockery against him. ""For many years, it's been the butt of jokes and used as a throwaway and undesirable location and used as a backyard. ""Today, it's a front yard,"" Reyes declared. 15 ways to see the world on water .","Since the 1930s, the Los Angeles River has been an off-limits flood control channel .

"A man who captured video of the fatal confrontation between New York police and Eric Garner was arrested Saturday night on gun possession charges at a Staten Island hotel, according to a law enforcement official. Ramsey Orta, 22, was a friend of Garner, who died July 17 after a police officer used a chokehold while arresting Garner, who was accused of selling cigarettes illegally. Orta's cell phone video showed Garner -- an asthmatic -- on the ground screaming that he couldn't breathe. Orta is being charged with criminal possession of an unloaded weapon because he did not have a permit to carry a concealed weapon, the source said. Orta was arrested leaving the hotel after police said they saw him passing an object to his girlfriend, who placed it in her waistband, according to the source. Police stopped them both and recovered a gun from the girlfriend's waistband, the source said. The girlfriend was also charged with possessing the gun, in addition to a marijuana charge, the official told CNN. The gun, a .25 caliber Norton semiautomatic handgun, was reported stolen in Michigan in 2007, a second law enforcement official said. Police were at the hotel because it's a known drug location, the source said. The source said it was only after the arrest that police realized Orta filmed the deadly confrontation with Garner when he told police, ""You're only mad at me because I filmed your boy."" Demonstrators in New York called the police response during Garner's arrest excessive and criminal. On Friday, the New York City medical examiner's office ruled the death a homicide. Officer Daniel Pantaleo, who is seen on the video choking Garner, was put on modified assignment and stripped of his badge and gun amid the investigation, the New York Police Department said. A second police officer was placed on desk duty. The chokehold tactic is prohibited by the NYPD. Orta is awaiting arraignment and could not be reached. The Staten Island district attorney's office said Orta's arraignment will happen Monday. The office declined to provide any further details on the arrest.

"All the elements for a grand love affair with Anne Hathaway are there: the adorable pixie cut, the large, luminous dark eyes, the successful career that literally began with a fairy tale. But be honest. She kind of bugs you, doesn't she? Google ""Anne Hathaway"" and ""hate,"" and the evidence is overwhelming. Link after link highlights the great American pastime (though it may actually be international, but more on that later) of being annoyed by the Oscar-winning actress. It's clear from the abundance of articles and negative comments that some people don't even want to see her face. According to one academic, there may be a scientific reason why. ""When times are good we prefer actresses with rounder faces,"" psychology professor Terry Pettijohn told Salon.com writer Daniel D'Addario in a piece titled ""Anne Hathaway: Hollywood's most polarizing star."" ""They convey these ideas of fun and youth."" Pettijon concluded that Hathaway has a ""mature face"" made distinctive by its slender shape and bone structure: ""It suggests she would be popular when times are more challenging."" Salon.com goes on, ""As the economy improves, Hathaway -- whose peak of fame, post-boyfriend, pre-Oscar-hosting, came amid the 2008 economic crash -- may just be a reminder of bad times."" Try and find a correlation between dislike of any other actress and the recession. We dare you. Such high-brow hatred is usually reserved for the elite, say a Gwyneth Paltrow, but Hathaway currently reigns supreme as the star so many love to hate. Like really hate. In a deep, visceral way that makes it hard even to pinpoint why. ""People do not like Anne Hathaway,"" wrote Brian Moylan of Hollywood.com. ""They use the word 'hate' a lot when they talk about her. And their hatred is vehement, like Itchy's for Scratchy, like the Hatfields' for the McCoys, and Taylor Swift's for every man who she has ever talked to since her 15th birthday."" Apparently this really holds true for women of the universe. Even in the midst of The Onion tweeting a vulgar term during the Academy Awards about 9-year-old best actress nominee Quvenzhane Wallis, there was still time to bash Hathaway. ""And what the Onion missed is that it's Anne Hathaway who's the real (expletive). Right EVERY WOMAN ON THE INTERNET?"" tweeted Buzzfeed's Jack Moore. So what's the deal? Why so much hate for an actress who defined cute in ""The Princess Diaries"" and held her own against Meryl Streep in ""The Devil Wears Prada""? Richard Lawson of The Atlantic Wire told Hollywood.com's Moylan that Hathaway has ""got this theater kid thing where she adopts the mood of every situation she's in -- rude and bawdy on 'Chelsea Lately,' poised and 'classy' at the Oscars, etc. -- but wildly overcompensates every time."" Lawson continued, ""She always seems like she's performing, and her favorite act is this overstated humility and graciousness."" Writer Victoria Wellman is one half of the Oratory Laboratory, a site that helps clients craft speeches. Part of Hathaway's problem, Wellman said, is that the actress is ""just one of the people who just doesn't come off as sincere."" Take for example her award show acceptance speeches. The whole point of awards shows is that no one knows who is going to win and the audience counts on that element of surprise to be part of a winner's speech, Wellman says. But Hathaway's words of gratitude come off as way too rehearsed. ""The more you rehearse something, the more kind of presumptuous it comes across,"" Wellman said. ""We are used to seeing actors act, but we want to see a glimpse of their personality. With Anne Hathaway, the Golden Globes speech came off as rehearsed word for word."" And the disdain isn't confined to just these shores. When Hathaway won the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, or BAFTA, award this year for best supporting actress for her role as Fantine in ""Les Miserables,"" her acceptance speech did not go over well. ""Anne annoyed audiences by thanking everyone remotely connected with 'Les Miserables,' even the author of the original novel Victor Hugo,"" reported EntertainmentWise.com. ""One snide remark on Twitter said: 'If Hathaway thanked Victor Hugo, will (director Kathryn) Bigelow have to thank bin Laden?' "" Not that Hathaway doesn't have her supporters. Reacting to all of the negative Hathaway buzz, ""Girls"" star Lena Dunham implored her Twitter followers to think of the greater good. ""Ladies: Anne Hathaway is a feminist and she has amazing teeth. Let's save our bad attitudes for the ones who aren't advancing the cause,"" Dunham tweeted. The actress is not oblivious to the shade being thrown her way. After her Oscar win for best supporting actress Sunday night, she was asked backstage her reaction to being teased about her earnestness. ""It does get to me, but you have to remember in life that there's a positive to every negative and a negative to every positive,"" Hathaway responded. ""And I'm going to ... I'm going to go there. The miracle of the universe is that, as far as they know, there's 51% matter versus 49% antimatter. Things tip in the scale of the positive. And so, that is what I focus on.""","Hating Anne Hathaway has become a favorite pastime for many .

"A decades-old mystery that captivated Oklahoma has been solved after officials confirmed the identities of two groups of people -- some of them teens -- who went missing in 1969 and 1970. The first crack in the cold cases came when police in the tiny town of Sayre were testing sonar equipment in September 2013 in murky Foss Lake. They were stunned to discover a green 1952 Chevrolet and a blue 1969 Chevrolet Camaro. Human remains found in the Camaro matched the general descriptions of three teenagers -- Jimmy Allen Williams, 16, Leah Gail Johnson, 18, and Thomas Michael Rios, 18, all from Sayre, the state Medical Examiner's Office said. Oklahoma lake bodies: Diver, trooper recount discovery . The other remains matched the genders and ages of three passengers in the green Chevrolet who went missing in 1969, the medical examiner said last year. John Alva Porter, then 69, was in that car with Cleburn Hammack, 42, and Nora Marie Duncan, 58. DNA test results this week prove that the bodies belonged to the missing, the state Medical Examiner's Office said, adding that they all died from drowning and their deaths were accidental. One night in 1970, another in 1969 . The three teenagers who disappeared went for a ride around their hometown in Williams' blue Camaro with a white top, according to the Doe Network, a volunteer organization that helps law enforcement solve cold cases. Only six days before the 16-year-old and his friends went missing, Williams had bought the used Camaro, a slick muscle car that teenage boys loved at that time, said Dayva Spitzer, publisher of The Sayre Record & Beckham County Democrat newspaper. Johnson was Native American and, Spitzer said, was related to legendary Indian chief Sitting Bull. Residents regarded Johnson as an Indian princess, she told CNN. Williams and his friends had planned to attend a football game the night they went missing, but they may have gone hunting instead, Spitzer said. Two rifles were found, rusted and corroded, in the Camaro. In the other car, Porter, Duncan and Hammack were last seen when their car was ""given a push"" to help get it started, according to a July 1969 newspaper article published in Oklahoma.","Human remains found in 2013 were tested for DNA .

"Growing up as a child in Damascus, it was evident that the current president of Syria, Bashar al-Assad, was first perceived by majority of Syrian people as a shy, reserved, introverted, weak, and hesitant child. He seemed to inherit none of his father's (Hafez al-Assad) or his brothers' (Maher and Bassel al-Assad) intelligence, strength, and leadership skills. Even Bashar's physical appearance — his tall and thin frame — added to his image as a frail person in the eyes of the majority of Syrian people. But, more fundamentally, the invisible hand of history would soon sweep away these perceptions and prove the majority wrong. How did the blue-eyed, tall, Western-educated ophthalmologist and reserved al-Assad, the one who was trained as a doctor to diagnose and eradicate diseases, so misgovern the domestic, regional, geopolitical and socio-economic affairs of Syria? How did the soft-spoken, withdrawn al-Assad, who favors a thin mustache, transcend into one of the most despised political figures of his generation? Before Bashar al-Assad became president, he was viewed by various Syrian social groups as rather bookish, not someone with the instincts or the drive to lead a country. Even a sympathizer with the Assad regime, an Alawite named Abu Hisham said to me: ""Bashar cannot stand against powers such as Israel and the United States. We need a leader who is strong like Bassel."" ""He's certainly not a leader,"" my cousin (who was later killed in the recent uprising) and his friends would say of Bashar before he assumed power. Bashar's destiny changed dramatically when he received a phone call from his father Hafez al-Assad in 1994. While studying at the Western Eye Hospital in England to be a professional ophthalmologist— and later live a luxurious life in the West— he was told to return to Damascus. The news of his older brother, Bassel's death in a car accident had reached Bashar and changed the direction of his life. Bassel was a parachutist, an accomplished athlete, a ladies' man, and an outgoing statesman being groomed to succeed his father as president. As Bashar was far from the public eye and not as involved in political affairs, Hafez al-Assad and his old guard advisors trained Bashar for several years in military and political affairs, along with Socialist Ba'ath and secular ideals. The military and ideological training of the al-Assads' old guard altered Bashar. However, Bashar al-Assad seems to have a distinct vision for Syria, other than the Socialist Ba'ath agenda of his father's old guard. While he endorsed the old guard's use of hard power and mass repression, the lifestyle and wealth of the West still occupied al-Assad's mind when he assumed power. In his inaugural speech, Bashar al-Assad emphasized that it was time to begin modernizing Syria. He stated: ""I shall try my very best to lead our country towards a future that fulfils the hopes and legitimate ambitions of our people."" While Hafez al-Assad and the old guard favored the more fundamentally socialist agenda of the Ba'ath party and attempted to gain legitimacy and support through minorities (Christians, Alawite, Shiite, and Druze), Bashar al-Assad focused on gradually adopting economic liberalization, neo-liberal and capitalist policies. This economic policy change intended to accumulate capital and wealth for the gilded inner circle, as well as to gain the support of other crucial social base— the business class— besides minorities. Bashar al-Assad miscalculated his policy changes though, as economic liberalization requires parallel political liberations. While Bashar al-Assad transferred public assets into the hands of his inner circle and top members of the business class, he resisted political liberations, equality, and redistribution of the wealth. He also increased the political repressions against political dissidents and human rights activists. Those social groups, that opposed the trained doctor, became the diagnosed diseases which had to be eradicated. In addition, his policies tremendously increased the gap between the rich and poor. Bashar al-Assad also allowed Iran to enjoy greater influence in Syria. Internal clashes and tensions between Bashar al-Assad and the old guard founding members of the Alawite-Ba'athist and socialist regime of Hafez al-Assad occurred. Men such as Ali Duba (the former head of the Syrian military intelligence and a close adviser to Hafez al-Assad), as well as hardliners such as Maher al-Assad (Bashar al-Assad's brother and commander of the Republican Guard and the Army's elite Fourth Armored Division) disagreed with Bashar's departure from Socialist Ba'ath policies. Bashar and his inner circle did gain short-term benefits, however, the long-term consequences sparked in March 2011. When the popular uprising erupted, Bashar focused on retaining the support of three significant social and political groups: the business class, the minorities (Alawite, Christians, Shiite, Druze, etc), and his hard power apparatuses (the army, Shabiha, snipers, intelligence, police, etc). Additionally, Bashar responded to the uprising with mixed reactions, on one hand offering promises and on the other enforcing mass repression. Bashar also allowed the empowerment and return of the old guard and hardliners such as one of the orchestrators of the Hama massacre Ali Duba and Maher al-Assad. For Bashar, Maher, and the old guard, tolerance for dissidents and compromise meant encouragement of further revolt. Bashar al-Assad and the old guard managed to survive as Syria's civil war has entered into its third year. Besides the mass repression and use of brute force, a crucial reason that the regime has been able to retain power is that a considerable amount of the business class, the minorities, and the army have not yet defected. Secondly, Bashar is cognizant of the international political structure and how he can use the strategic and geopolitical significance of Syria in order to gain financial, military, and intelligence support from the Islamic Republic of Iran, Hezbollah, and Russia. Thirdly, Bashar al-Assad has been capable of creating distinct narratives among the minorities, the business class and the West. Finally, Bashar has worked to pass off, to the international community, the idea that there is no better or more efficient alternative to his rule. As Bashar al-Assad has repeatedly argued, either he, or the ""terrorists"" will rule Syria. He has infused this argument with a threat -- that if he does not rule over a unified Syria, he can instigate as conflict throughout the region and turn the nation into a conflagration.","Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was seen as a reserved child, writes Majid Rafizadeh .

"A powerful reaction to women-hater Elliot Rodger's killing rampage Friday night has been the Twitter hashtag #YesAllWomen, where women point out how misogyny and sexism damage them and restrict their lives. It emerged in response to the common, misguided argument that ""not all men"" are like that. Of course not all men are like Elliot Rodger. But he is the product of a culture that condones and in many cases endorses the belief that if you are a ""nice guy"" -- or a ""supreme gentleman"" as Rodger described himself -- you are somehow entitled to sex with women. Gun control, campus safety and mental illness are all issues raised by the massacre, but hatred of women concerns me most. I am the founder of The UnSlut Project, which fights ""slut shaming"" and sexual bullying in our schools and communities. I'm also a graduate student at University of California, Santa Barbara, where the rampage took place. Why #YesAllWomen took off on Twitter . Rodger and others like him believe that sex is a reward to be earned, not a consensual activity between adults who respect each other, and that women are prizes to be won, not actual people with the agency to make decisions about their own bodies. Nowhere is this mindset more obvious than in the reactions of some men who actually sympathize with Rodger. Many of these men are self-described Pick-Up Artists, or PUAs, who employ a series of strict rules in order to manipulate women into having sex with them, referring to those women as their ""targets."" Rodger allegedly participated in forums on the site PUAHate, which criticizes Pick-Up Artists not because of their obviously misogynist tactics, but because those tactics didn't work for him and other PUAHate members. The site shut down Saturday morning with the message: ""PUAHate is about to get a massive amount of press,"" according to the watchdog Southern Poverty Law Center. After the killings, the extent of misogyny in this community was revealed in the creation of a Facebook page called ""Elliot Rodger Is an American Hero,"" with the advice for everyone to ""share your thoughts and pay your respects to Elliot Rodger here. Also, view this final message from our beloved hero,"" which links to his videotaped rant, with commenters expressing solidarity with his desire for revenge against women. The page has since been taken down. The creator of the popular PUA site ""Return of Kings"" -- where ""women and homosexuals are prohibited from commenting"" -- claimed, ""More people will die unless you give men sexual options."" ""Manosphere"" sites like Return of Kings admire ""alpha males,"" disparage ""beta males,"" and promote hypermasculinity. But again, most  men are not members of these hate communities and not all men hold similar beliefs. That's not the point. These views are just extreme versions of very common, socially acceptable ideas about women and sex. Rodger was undoubtedly mentally unstable, but some of the sexist ideas in his manifesto are, unfortunately, not the invention of a madman. They're the norm. This is the first time I have publicly identified myself as a graduate student at UCSB. I founded The UnSlut Project by blogging my own middle school diary, so I use a pen name and guard my identity in order to protect people I mentioned in those diary entries. But in the wake of this crisis, I want to speak out. The university has responded in an admirable way: setting up a 24-hour call center and extensive counseling options to help students cope, establishing the U.C .Santa Barbara Community Fund to honor the victims, and organizing campuswide memorial events. Opinion: Shooter's rage at women too familiar in America . As the details of Rodger's history and the crime itself continue to emerge, we will have a better idea of the institutional steps that could have been taken to prevent it. We will write letters to our representatives and use our votes to speak up about what we believe should be done to prevent future tragedies. But in the meantime, on a personal level, we need to take responsibility for our own reactions to this story. We teach our children from a young age that a girl's value as a human being is inextricably linked to her sexual behavior. Her virginity is something to be ""given up"" or even ""lost."" Sex with her is a prize to be won -- and she herself is equated with that ""prize."" In stark contrast, boys are taught that their virginity is something to be ashamed of. Their masculinity depends on sexual prowess and physical dominance. It is from this understanding that the PUA movement arises, populated by boys and men who feel worthless because they don't have sex. Their anger is directed at the women -- the ""prizes"" -- who refuse to ""give"" them what they feel they deserve. So where do we go from here? Although it brought to light the various struggles of women across the country, #YesAllWomen is, ultimately, just a hashtag. It will stop trending. When it does, let's continue the conversation outside the realm of social media. Tuesday afternoon, I will join the rest of the UCSB community at a memorial service for Rodger's victims. As we mourn Katherine Cooper, Christopher Martinez, Veronika Weiss, Weihan Wang, George Chen, and Cheng Yuan Hong, conversations will focus on their lives, personalities, and accomplishments. But as we move forward and try to make sense of what happened, it's our responsibility to start productive, respectful conversations about the misogyny behind Rodger's actions. Instead of avoiding talking about sex, let's start age-appropriate conversations with our children about consent and respect. Let's speak up when a man in our group of friends speaks disrespectfully about a woman he's had sex with. And most important, let's analyze our own assumptions about what sex means with regard to different genders. Most men are not killers like Elliot Rodger. Most men don't sympathize with his motives. But all of us, regardless of gender, can contribute to changing the misogynist culture that inspired him.","Emily Lindin: Elliot Rodger is part of a culture that says nice guys are entitled to sex with women .

"On a windy hillside near Copenhagen, Denmark, are the headquarters of a company with a simple goal: to make the smallest hearing aids in the world. Widex, one of the globe's largest hearing aid companies, developed its first model in 1956. Back then, it came with its own battery pack and had to be strapped to the chest. They've been gradually shrinking ever since and 3D printing technology has now enabled the slender machines to vanish almost completely into the ear. ""The smallest are less than the size of the tip of a little finger,"" says Soren Westermann, the Widex CEO whose father co-founded the company nearly 60 years ago. Back then, hearing aid technology had just made a great leap forward following the invention of the electric transistor in 1948. Westermann recalls that when he was born, hearing aids had been hulking, impractical devices ""that you wore on your back."" But the energy efficiency and relatively small size of the transistor -- which is used to amplify electronic signals -- paved the way for the now familiar ""behind the ear"" style of hearing aid. Since then, the mechanics have become evermore sophisticated, moving from analogue amplification to digital and from behind the ear to right inside it. Widex are now the pioneers of a manufacturing process known as Computer Aided Manufacturing for Individual Shells for Hearing Aids or, less cumbersomely, CAMISHA. The process takes advantage of recently developed 3D printing technology to create staggeringly precise molds of the ear canal. ""First we make the impression of the ear,"" explains Westermann. ""It's still done the old-fashioned way: impression material (liquid silicone) is injected in the ear and as it sets it shows a perfect reproduction of the ear canal."" But it's the second stage of production where things get smart. Standing in the Widex lab, Westermann demonstrates how the finely detailed mold is scanned through a 3D scanner taking millions of measurements to create what he calls a ""3D point-cloud"" representing exactly the inside of a patient's ear. Then, layer-by-layer, a large 3D printer replicates the precise dimensions of the mold using photo-acrylic gel, a type of liquid plastic. Finally, the tiny mechanical components -- consisting of a microphone, a receiver, a battery, and an almost microscopic computer chip -- are inserted into the plastic shell. ""The detail that we can reproduce is down to a hundredth of a millimeter,"" claims Westermann. The precision and efficiency of the process has resulted in the world's smallest ever hearing aids. For Westermann, this is a significant development. ""Invisibility is extremely important ... It is so clear that nobody wants to demonstrate or show their hearing loss,"" he explains. But the CAMISHA process offers more than discretion. Unlike previous models, which blocked large parts of the ear with big plastic shells, the so-called Invisible In-Canal (IIC) hearing aids allow for more sound to be collected naturally by the shape of the ear, and to flow down the ear canal as it would with unassisted hearing, improving the fidelity and range of sound. The fact that the shell is modeled so exactly on the user's ear also prevents any noise from leaking out. According to Westermann, this was the cause of irritating ""whistling"" in previous models. ""The sound will leak from near the ear drum and out between the ear piece and the ear canal. It will leak out there and go back to the microphone, then it will feedback and whistle,"" he said. In addition to these technical improvements, the precision of the mold, says Westermann, means that it is substantially more comfortable. Previous manufacturing methods, which Westermann describes as more like a form of manual sculpting, allowed for small discrepancies between the silicone mold and the hearing aid, causing potentially significant discomfort. ""The ear canal is actually extremely sensitive, so the tiniest irregularity may be intolerable,"" he says. ""Now they are perfect every time. We know beforehand that they can fit, we know they are as small as they could possibly be and we know that we can make them exactly the same every time,"" he adds. At least for now, however, the premium sound and comfort comes at a premium price. While you can get a conventional hearing aid for a few hundred dollars, the CAMISHA produced models range from about $1,000-$3,000 per device. Westermann, as you might expect, says his customers rarely suffer from buyer's remorse. ""We get a lot of feedback letters, feedback from people who say 'I can't imagine why I waited five years to get one of these,'"" he says. ""People tell us they had forgot the sound of the birds. They were walking in the forest and suddenly heard these birds again and they hadn't heard them for 10 years and they had forgot they were still there. ""That makes a lot of difference in your work, to know that you made a difference to somebody else.""","Danish hearing aid company develops manufacturing process based on 3D printing .

"Colorado shooter Karl Pierson had written plans to attack at least five areas of Arapahoe High School on his arm, as well as the Latin phrase for ""The Die Has Been Cast,"" the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office said Tuesday. Specifically, he'd written five letters/ numbers on his arm, corresponding with the library and classrooms near it, that investigators believe indicate what he planned to do. ""Teams of Sheriff's Office investigators will attempt to determine the relevance of the list of numbers written on the shooter's arm to specific classrooms, while closely evaluating if the occupants of those classrooms may have also been targeted for harm by the shooter,"" the Sheriff's Office said in a statement. According to police accounts, Friday's shooting began at 12:33 p.m. when Pierson, 18, walked into Arapahoe High School armed with a pump-action shotgun, a machete and a backpack containing three Molotov cocktails, a bandolier of ammunition across his chest. He shot 17-year-old Claire Esther Davis once in the head amid shots fired randomly into school hallways. She is in critical condition. He also ignited one of the firebombs in the school library before killing himself in the back corner of the library. Police say Pierson was looking for revenge against a librarian but couldn't find the faculty member and killed himself as a school resource officer closed in. Davis was just a random victim, police surmised, and the gunman and victim didn't know each other. Pierson's parents released a statement Monday afternoon, offering prayers for Davis' full recovery. ""As parents, we loved our son Karl dearly and we are devastated by what happened Friday. We cannot begin to understand why Karl did what he did,"" Barbara and Mark Pierson said. They also offered prayers ""for the entire Arapahoe High School community, as we know your lives are forever changed by this horrific event."" Colorado's school shooting -- over in 80 seconds .

"""Do the Republican and Democratic parties do an adequate job of representing the American people, or do they do such a poor job that a third major party is required?"" A record 60% of Americans now yearn for a third major party, according to Gallup. Independents, unsurprisingly, are most likely to favor a third party, but a majority of self-described Republicans say yes, too. But what do they mean by that ""yes""? Obviously, they mean many different things. Some yearn for a third party representing the Michael Bloomberg center: fiscally conservative and socially liberal like the New York City mayor. But here's a caution about third parties in American history: They are much more likely to arise on the fringes of the political system, not the center. America has seen third-party efforts by socialists and segregationists; by right-to-lifers and libertarians. This is why you now hear so much ""third party"" talk coming from tea party Republicans rather than (as you might expect) the party's subordinated pragmatists. The sensible center is much more likely to exert itself inside existing parties, as Dwight Eisenhower did for Republicans in the 1950s and as Bill Clinton did for the Democrats in the 1990s. Pragmatists want to change the GOP so that it can win elections and govern effectively. Tea party Republicans prefer to express their principles regardless of consequences, which is why the Pew survey in September found that 71% of them favored a government shutdown even though nearly 40% of them expected that shutdown to have a ""major"" impact on the economy. Third-party threats frighten Republican leaders. They remember that Ross Perot's independent challenge badly hurt George H.W. Bush's re-election campaign in 1992. Canadian conservatives were locked out of power for nearly 15 years by a party split in the 1990s. British Conservatives fear that a rise in support for the United Kingdom Independence Party could drain support from Britain's Conservative-Liberal governing coalition. Yet politics is a complicated business, and it's not always true that a party is weakened by the departure of its most extreme supporters. Consider, for example, the case of the Democratic Party in the election of 1948. That year, the Democrats faced two groups that bolted. To protest President Harry Truman's turn to support civil rights, southern Democrats coalesced as a ""States' Rights"" party and nominated South Carolina Gov. Strom Thurmond for president. Left-liberal Democrats angered by Truman's tough Cold War foreign policy created an ""American Labor"" party and nominated former vice president Henry Wallace. Together, Thurmond and Wallace took almost 5% of the vote in 1948. Thurmond carried four Deep South states and 7% of the Electoral College. Yet Truman survived. In fact, there's a reasonable argument that Truman was actually helped by these third- and fourth-party challenges. In 1948, African-Americans remained very much a swing constituency. Hundreds of thousands of black Americans had moved north and gained voting rights in the 30 years between 1917 and 1948. As a group, they tended to prefer the New Deal policies of the Democratic Party, but they deeply distrusted that party's Southern white supremacist wing. Truman was a card-carrying member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans who had adopted the civil rights cause late in his career. Could he really be trusted? Truman's willingness to face down Thurmond convinced many Northern blacks that he could be. He carried an estimated 77% of the black vote in the North, and those votes provided the margin of victory in the three crucial states of California, Illinois and Ohio. Those three states provided 73 electoral votes in total, and they were each won by Truman with a margin of less than 1%. Meanwhile, the Wallace challenge helped Truman with more conservative voters. Truman had initiated the Marshall Plan and the Berlin Airlift, yet some questioned whether the Democrats were tough enough on communism -- an important question among voters of eastern European origin in states like Wisconsin and Michigan. With Wallace vehemently denouncing Truman as too tough on the Soviet Union -- sometimes in speeches that echoed  the editorials of the newspaper of the American Communist Party -- Truman gained the same kind of political cover on his right flank that Thurmond had provided him on his left. The result, everybody knows. Right now, tea party extremism contaminates the whole Republican brand. It's a very interesting question whether a tea party bolt from the GOP might not just liberate the party to slide back to the political center -- and liberate Republicans from identification with the Sarah Palins and the Ted Cruzes who have done so much harm to their hopes over the past three election cycles. It's worth repeating over and over again. Add Todd Akin in Missouri and Richard Mourdock in Indiana, Sharron Angle in Nevada and Ken Buck in Colorado, Christine O'Donnell in Delaware and Joe Miller in Alaska -- and you have half a dozen Senate races lost to the GOP by extremist nominations. Maybe the right answer to the threat, ""Shut down the government or we quit"" is: ""So sad you feel that way. Don't let the door hit you on the way out.""","David Frum: Tea party extremism contaminates the Republican brand .

"For the fourth year in a row, House Republicans have passed a balanced budget. Each time, we've put forward a plan that stops spending money we don't have, creates jobs with pro-growth reforms, strengthens the safety net, and expands opportunity for all. And each time we've learned a little bit more about where the two parties stand. If you look at President Barack Obama's budget -- Senate Democrats refused to write one this year -- it's clear where he and his party place their trust: Washington. He wants to raise taxes by $1.8 trillion -- on top of the $1.7 trillion he's already raised. He wants to increase spending by $791 billion. And he never balances the budget -- ever. Time and again, the President and his party put government in the driver's seat. They want to take more from families to spend more in Washington. Whether it's health care, energy, or taxes, Democrats want the federal government to play a bigger role in the lives of Americans and our economy. And that's great for Washington; it thrives on more power. But the American people will lose out. They'll face less opportunity, more debt, and fewer jobs. By contrast, House Republicans have put forward a plan that puts our trust in the people. Our plan balances the budget in just 10 years. We cut $5.1 trillion in spending over the next decade by eliminating waste and making much-needed reforms. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says the deficit reduction in our budget will grow the economy. Under our plan, in 2024, economic output will be 1.8% greater than it otherwise would be. That works out to about $1,100 per person. A quick reality check for the critics and big spenders in Washington: On the current path, the federal government will spend roughly $48 trillion over the next 10 years. By contrast, this budget will spend nearly $43 trillion. On the current path, spending will grow, on average, by 5.2% a year. Under our budget, spending will grow, on average, by 3.5% a year. Nearly $43 trillion is enough. Increasing spending by 3.5% instead of 5.2% is hardly draconian. Responsible spending restraint is just one part of our plan. We also call for pro-growth tax reform and greater energy production. We repeal Obamacare and clear the way for patient-centered reforms. We protect and strengthen Medicare. We repair the safety net so it's there for those who need it, and we give states the flexibility they need to help people move up the ladder of life. Our budget will root out cronyism, because we believe the American people deserve a level playing field. In fact, we eliminate $7 billion of corporate welfare within the Department of Commerce alone. We want the best and brightest to lead the way. Businesses shouldn't succeed because of the connections they have in Washington. They should succeed based on the value they generate and the jobs they create. We can expand opportunity by empowering people, not bureaucrats. All of these solutions would help create jobs. Instead of sending more money to Washington -- instead of funding more Solyndras and racking up more debt -- we return power to the people by cutting tax rates and wasteful spending. Under our plan, people will spend less time navigating the maze that is Washington and more time developing the new ideas that will power our economy. So this debate boils down to a question of trust. Do we trust Washington to know what's best for our health care, our economy, or our families? Or do we trust the people of this country to make an honest assessment about what's best for their lives? Republicans have made our choice. We've put forward a budget that harnesses the power of economic freedom and respects the dignity of every person. We trust the American people to lead our country forward.

"Beijing (CNN) -- China is all set to give out its own first-ever peace prize Thursday, a move apparently to counter the Norwegian Nobel committee's choice of imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo as this year's laureate. Organizers told CNN they will present the Confucius Peace Prize -- which comes with an award of $15,000 -- in Beijing to promote the ancient sage's philosophy, a day before the Nobel committee honors Liu in Oslo. ""China is a great nation that has been influenced by the Confucian concept of peace for a long time,"" said Tan Changliu, chairman of the awards committee. ""We want to promote world peace from an Eastern perspective."" ""Europe is full of small countries that had fought each other for centuries,"" he added. ""We don't want to see people who don't understand peace to ruin the concept."" Tan declined to give details about his group -- other than saying it is a non-government organization -- or how the five-judge awards committee operated. His committee has released a vaguely worded statement on its criteria for choosing the winner, but announced this year's nominees included Nelson Mandela, Bill Gates and the Panchen Lama, a Tibetan Buddhist leader loyal to Beijing. China has responded furiously since the Nobel committee announced its decision on October 8. Officials have repeatedly called Liu -- currently serving an 11-year sentence for ""inciting subversion"" -- a common criminal and the award a Western plot against China. A businessman first proposed a rival peace prize in a commentary on the November 17 edition of Global Times, an English-language newspaper published by the Communist Party mouthpiece People's Daily. Echoing government spokesmen, Liu Zhiqin said that by awarding the prize to a criminal, the Nobel committee created 1.3 billion ""dissidents"" in China. ""We often stress the need to fight for the right to speak,"" he wrote. ""China's civil society should consider setting up a 'Confucius Peace Prize'... to declare China's view on peace and human rights to the world."" China has warned other countries of ""consequences"" if they attend Friday's Nobel ceremony in Oslo. A foreign ministry spokeswoman said Tuesday that more than 100 countries and groups had joined China in boycotting this year's event. The Nobel committee, which said it had sent out 65 invitations to embassies in Oslo, counted 19 countries that had declined so far -- including China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Iraq and Iran.

"No matter what you call it -- bonuses, incentives, market or performance pay  -- the Department of Veterans Affairs gave out a lot to senior managers in recent years despite sometimes deadly waits for health care and other problems faced by American veterans. A top VA official confirmed to a congressional committee on Friday that 78% of VA senior managers qualified for extra pay or other compensation in fiscal year 2013 by receiving ratings of ""outstanding"" or ""exceeds fully successful,"" and that all 470 of them got ratings of ""fully successful"" or better. Such widespread laudatory performance appraisals occurred shortly before CNN started reporting in November how veterans waited excessive periods for VA health care, with some dying in the process. The VA has acknowledged 23 deaths nationwide due to delayed care. In Phoenix, CNN reported in April that the VA used fraudulent record-keeping -- including an alleged secret list -- that covered up the waiting periods. A fatal wait: Veterans languish and die on a VA hospital's secret list . That didn't stop the head of the Phoenix VA medical center, Sharon Helman, from getting an $8,500 bonus last year. Helman's bonus got rescinded earlier this year after the VA controversy made headlines. She was placed on administrative leave but continues to receive her salary, said Gina Farrisee, the VA assistant secretary for human resources and administration, at a House Veterans' Affairs Committee hearing. Questionable bonuses . Panel chairman Jeff Miller, a Florida Republican, cited numerous examples of what he characterized as unwarranted bonuses to VA officials overseeing a department with such problems in recent years: . •             The medical center director in Dayton, Ohio, receiving a bonus exceeding $10,000 despite an investigation of veterans getting exposed to hepatitis B and C at the facility; . •             The former director of the VA regional office in Waco, Texas, getting more than $53,000 in bonuses when the average processing time for disability claims increased to what Miller called ""inexcusable levels."" •             The director of the Pittsburgh health care system getting a top performance review and a regional director getting a $63,000 bonus despite a legionella outbreak in the Pittsburgh VA health care system that led to six patient deaths. ""To the average American, $63,000 is considered to be a competitive annual salary, not a bonus,"" Miller said. Farrisee offered administrative explanations about the bonus system that did little to satisfy committee members. In particular, the Helman case in Phoenix got a lot of attention, with legislators from both parties asking how it could happen. She explained how the bonus should never have been given because Helman was being investigated in connection with the problems at the Phoenix VA facility, and therefore the extra money was eligible to be rescinded. Can't go back . However, Farrisee said in almost all other cases, a performance rating and resulting bonus can't be rescinded later on. ""If we knew what we knew today at that time, it is unlikely that their performance would have reflected what it reflected at the time the reports were written,"" she said when asked by Miller about going back to change the performance review results. However, ""you cannot go back and change a rating once it has been issued to an employee as the final rating,"" Farrisee said, adding that was the law rather than a government rule. An exasperated Miller called it a law that needed to change as part of an overhaul of a culture throughout the VA motivated more by performance bonuses than serving veterans. ""We can't keep doing it the way it's been being done,"" he said, to which Farrisee responded: ""I concur, Mr. Chairman."" The controversy, with multiple investigations and increasing revelations of problems with newly returned veterans getting care on a timely basis, caused retired Army Gen. Eric Shinseki to resign on May 30 as Veterans Affairs secretary. Fear kept the VA scandal . His successor, interim Secretary Sloan Gibson, has ruled out any bonuses for senior managers in 2014 as part of initial steps intended to get more immediate care for hundreds of thousands of waiting veterans. Updated figures . Earlier this week, an updated audit revealed about 177,000 veterans were still waiting at least two months for an appointment at VA medical centers. Gibson said some of the delays on the audit update appeared worse than previously reported because hospital administrators were beginning to use proper scheduling procedures that accurately reflected the number of veterans waiting. For example, the update showed more than 43,000 veterans waiting longer than 120 days for an appointment, compared to 13,000 listed earlier this month. According to Gibson, more appointments have been added, but some VA hospitals lack the capacity to see patients quickly, which also contributed to a spike in the figures. The VA has reached out to 70,000 veterans waiting for appointments in order to get them into clinics, he said. At this point, the VA's Office of Inspector General is investigating 69 facilities for allegations that administrators altered appointment data or used secret waiting lists to make patient wait times appear shorter in order to earn financial bonuses. Farrisee said Friday that schedulers sought to meet their performance goal -- and therefore qualify for bonuses -- by showing veterans got appointments within 14 days. An internal audit by the VA called that 14-day goal implemented under Shinseki's leadership unattainable and reported 13% of schedulers were instructed to manipulate data in some form. Gibson has eliminated the 14-day target for the Veterans Health Administration, which has more than 1,700 facilities that serve almost 9 million veterans each year.

"Jahi McMath is no longer inside the hospital where doctors declared her brain-dead after tonsil surgery last month. But family members won't reveal where they took the 13-year-old after Children's Hospital & Research Center Oakland released her Sunday night. ""We're very relieved that she got safely to where she needed to be, because we were all very afraid, given the fragile condition as she wasted away at Children's, that she might not make it,"" attorney Chris Dolan told reporters Monday. The move ends one chapter of a weeks-long struggle between the hospital, which sought to remove Jahi from a ventilator after doctors and a judge concluded she was brain-dead, and her relatives, who fought in court to keep her on the ventilator and contended she showed signs of life. Why brain dead means really dead . ""As a family, we are definitely relieved that she's no longer at Children's Hospital, but we're all emotionally drained,"" Omari Sealey, the girl's uncle, told CNN's Piers Morgan Live on Monday night. ""This has been an incredible roller-coaster ride of emotions."" He said so long as his niece's heart is beating, Jahi is alive. ""She's moving a lot more. She responds to audio and touch, and more compelling evidence is the fact that she can move her head and neck,"" Sealey said. The hospital released Jahi on Sunday to the Alameda County coroner, who then released her to her mother's custody, said Dr. David Durand, the hospital's chief of pediatrics. The hospital had previously said it needed the coroner's consent for the transfer because Jahi was legally dead. Jahi -- who was declared brain-dead December 12 after post-surgery complications that her family says included severe bleeding and cardiac arrest -- was moved from the hospital Sunday accompanied by a critical-care team. She was attached to a ventilator, but with no feeding tube in place. On Monday, Dolan said Jahi was being given antibiotics to fight infections and nutritional support. ""They're giving her everything that a person who would have a chance to live would be getting,"" he said. He declined to provide details about the type of facility, citing privacy and security concerns. ""She's where she's going to be for a while,"" he said. ""She needs to be medically stabilized, medically treated."" On Sunday, the president of a rehabilitation center in New York told CNN that the facility would gladly accept Jahi. But Dolan said the family has no plans to give more details about her location. ""We've had people make threats from around the country. It's sad that people act that way,"" Dolan said. ""So for Jahi's safety and those around her, we will not be saying where she went or where she is."" At least five different facilities that originally offered to care for Jahi fell through, he said. But ultimately, the family chose from a number of offers. ""There were other facilities that still had their hand extended,"" he said. ""But we took the first one that we knew would pull us in."" Let parents decide if teen is dead . The surgery . Jahi's case drew national attention and fueled debate as a fierce court battle unfolded between devastated family members fighting to keep her on a ventilator and doctors arguing she'd already died. Family members say the eighth-grader was alert and talking after doctors removed her tonsils, adenoids and extra sinus tissue in a surgery at the Oakland hospital on December 9. Doctors had recommended the surgery to treat pediatric obstructive sleep apnea, a condition which made her stop breathing in her sleep and caused other medical problems. Before the surgery, Jahi said she was worried that she would never wake up, according to her uncle. She seemed fine after the surgery, but asked for a Popsicle because her throat hurt. Not long afterward, something went terribly wrong. In an intensive care unit, the girl began bleeding profusely, the family said. According to family members, Jahi went into cardiac arrest. Days later, she was declared brain-dead. Hospital officials have said privacy laws prevent them from discussing details of the case. The court battle and the medical debate . The family and the hospital disagreed over whether to disconnect her from a ventilator, and the issue wound up in Alameda Superior Court. In court documents and public comments, the hospital maintained that there's no doubt that McMath is brain-dead, describing the condition as irreversible. ""No amount of prayer, no amount of hope, no amount of any type of medical procedure will bring her back,"" Children's Hospital Oakland spokesman Sam Singer said last month. ""The medical situation here in this case is that Jahi McMath died several weeks ago."" A judge on December 23 appointed Dr. Paul Fisher, chief of pediatric neurology at Stanford Children's Hospital, to evaluate Jahi. Fisher concluded the next day that she met the criteria for brain death. According to a court filing, Fisher found that the girl's pupils were fully dilated and unresponsive to light and that she did not respond to a variety of intense stimuli. His report also says Jahi showed no sign of breathing on her own when a ventilator was removed: ""Patient failed apnea test."" The report says her heart was beating only because of the mechanical ventilator. In addition, an imaging test showed no blood flow to Jahi's brain, while another showed no sign of electrical activity. Fisher's conclusion: ""Overall, unfortunate circumstances in 13-year-old with known, irreversible brain injury and now complete absence of cerebral function and complete absence of brainstem function, child meets all criteria for brain death, by professional societies and state of California."" After seeing Fisher's report, Alameda Superior Court Judge Evelio Grillo concluded on December 24 that Jahi was brain dead. But Grillo twice ruled that the hospital had to hold off on disconnecting Jahi from life support, ultimately giving the family and the facility until January 7 to come to a resolution. The Alameda County coroner issued a death certificate for Jahi on Friday, listing December 12 as the date of death. The certificate still needed to be accepted by the health department to become official. Medical ethicists, meanwhile, say the high-profile case fuels a misperception: that ""brain death"" is somehow not as final as cardiac death, even though, by definition, it is. The case is ""giving the impression that dead people can come back to life,"" Arthur Caplan, director of the Division of Medical Ethics at NYU Langone Medical Center, told CNN last month. Family members say they've seen reason for hope . Jahi's family members maintain that they're hoping for a miracle. Her mother told CNN last month that she'd seen improvements, including indications from a hospital monitor that she said suggest her daughter was trying to breathe on her own. The girl's uncle, Sealey, told reporters last week that a pediatrician has seen Jahi and has sworn she is not dead. Hawaii girl, 3, dies after dental procedure . When asked about the girl's possible movement, Singer, the hospital spokesman, said he would not comment directly on any claims the family makes, citing privacy laws. However, Singer said it is ""quite common"" for the muscles of brain dead patients to move, stressing it's ""not a sign of life."" So far the family has raised more than $50,000 on GoFundMe.com to move her. According to the site, more than 1,300 people have donated money in 10 days. ""We're very grateful, very proud,"" said Sealey. ""We want to thank everyone that supported us, everyone that stood in our corner, everyone that prayed for us, everyone that helped donate to make this possible. Without you guys, none of this would be possible."" He didn't rule out the possibility that the family could eventually file a lawsuit against the hospital. But he dismissed concerns that details about what happened during and after Jahi's surgery could be lost if she remains on a ventilator. ""That's pretty much saying that she's evidence and she's a body, and we don't look at it that way,"" Sealey said. ""We're not worried about accountability. We're worried about survival."" In releasing Jahi, the hospital said: ""Our hearts go out to the family as they grieve for this sad situation and we wish them closure and peace.""

"A potent little painkiller is causing a big stir. A coalition of more than 40 health care, consumer and addiction treatment groups is urging the Food and Drug Administration to revoke approval of the prescription drug Zohydro. The hydrocodone-based drug is the latest in a long line of painkillers called opioid analgesics. The FDA approved the medication last fall to treat chronic pain, and it is set to become available to patients in March. ""In the midst of a severe drug epidemic fueled by overprescribing of opioids, the very last thing the country needs is a new, dangerous, high-dose opioid,"" the coalition wrote in a letter to FDA Commissioner Dr. Margaret Hamburg. ""Too many people have already become addicted to similar opioid medications, and too many lives have been lost."" One addiction expert who signed the letter was more forthright. ""It's a whopping dose of hydrocodone packed in an easy-to-crush capsule,"" said Dr. Andrew Kolodny, president of the advocacy group Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing. ""It will kill people as soon as it's released."" The letter is the latest in a series of entreaties to the FDA related to Zohydro. In December, 29 state attorneys general sent a similar letter to the FDA. The month before, members of Congress asked the agency to review its decision to approve the drug. The concerns echoed by all groups are broadly about the drug's potency and abuse potential. They say they fear that Zohydro -- especially at higher doses -- will amplify already-rising overdose numbers. ""This could be the next OxyContin,"" says a petition on Change.org asking the FDA to reconsider. Report: States failing to curb prescription abuse . According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, prescription opioid deaths more than quadrupled since 1999 -- there were 4,030 deaths involving the drugs in 1999, compared with 16,651 in 2010. ""You're talking about a drug that's somewhere in the neighborhood of five times more potent than what we're dealing with now,"" said Dr. Stephen Anderson, a Washington emergency room physician who is not part of the most recent petition to the FDA about the drug. ""I'm five times more concerned, solely based on potency."" Both Zohydro's maker, Zogenix, and the FDA assert the drug's benefits outweigh its risks. ""We do not expect the introduction of Zohydro ER (extended release) to increase the overall use of opioids,"" said Dr. Brad Galer, executive vice president and chief medical officer at Zogenix, in an e-mail. ""In fact, prescription data from the last five years shows that total use of ER opioids is constant and independent of new entrants to the market."" Galer said the company will focus its commercial efforts on a small group of doctors with good experience prescribing opioids, so that only appropriate chronic pain patients would receive the drug. Advocates for pain patients say that concerns about abuse, while valid for some, are not necessarily an issue for those patients. ""We know that a person with pain is not a person who abuses medications,"" said Paul Gileno, founder and president of the U.S. Pain Foundation, a group that receives some funding in unrestricted grants from the pharmaceutical industry.  ""A person with pain is a person suffering to get pain relief in order to live a fulfilling life."" Opinion: How safe are your prescription drugs? In their petition to the FDA for approval, Zogenix representatives cited examples of patients who might benefit from Zohydro: a 46-year-old male with chronic back and leg pain who had two failed back surgeries; a 52-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer experiencing diffuse pain; a 32-year-old woman with multiple orthopedic fractures. If Zohydro follows in the footsteps of its opioid-containing predecessors, such a narrow, focused patient group may expand -- to patients with low back pain, fibromyalgia, arthritis or countless other chronic conditions. ""The problem is, it costs a lot of money bringing a drug through clinical trials and then bringing it to market,"" said Anderson, past president of the Washington chapter of the American College of Emergency Physicians. ""You have to anticipate (the drug company) being able to market and get its money back. ""I see this as a marketing ploy where eventually it's 'I've got bigger, I've got stronger, why don't you prescribe this,' and I'm terrified of that."" Dr. Sanjay Gupta: Let's end the prescription drug death epidemic . Bigger, stronger opioids -- especially those containing hydrocodone -- are a concern. Hydrocodone (Zohydro's sole ingredient) is one of the most frequently prescribed -- and abused -- opioids. For that reason, in October, the FDA said it intended to shift hydrocodone-containing drugs from Schedule III to Schedule II. That rescheduling (still pending approval by the Drug Enforcement Administration) would mean much stricter dispensing and prescribing rules for hydrocodone-containing products. At the time of that recommendation, the FDA posted a statement on its website that it ""... has become increasingly concerned about the abuse and misuse of opioid products, which have sadly reached epidemic proportions in certain parts of the United States."" A day after announcing the proposed drug schedule change for hydrocodone, the FDA announced Zohydro's approval. It was a confusing juxtaposition, some say. ""Shocking, outrageous and genuinely frightening,"" said Kolodny of the Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing. FDA spokeswoman Morgan Liscinsky said that Zohydro's approval was separate and distinct from the agency's recommendation about rescheduling hydrocodone-containing products. ""I find great difficulty (with) the wisdom of the FDA's approval in terms of protecting the public's health,"" said Dr. Alex Cahana, professor of pain medicine at the University of Washington in Seattle, who was not among those who signed the letter to the FDA. ""Risk-benefit thinking suggests that not everything we can do, we should do."" Zohydro will enter the market already classified as a Schedule II -- one reason both the FDA and the drug's maker are confident it will not contribute to the broader overdose problem. Zohydro's labeling will feature warnings about abuse, addiction and misuse, and Galer said Zogenix is working on an abuse-deterrent version of Zohydro that should become available in three years. None of those precautions has assuaged concerns. Anderson said that while a small subset of patients may benefit from Zohydro, unleashing such a potent drug in the current environment is unsafe. ""Put more of this kind of drug out on the street and, I'll see more overdoses related to this, no question,"" Anderson said.

"The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A) is pulling millions of dollars in investments out of three U.S. companies tied to the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories. In a close vote at its annual assembly in Detroit on Friday, the church voted 310-303 to divest $21 million from Caterpillar, Hewlett-Packard and Motorola Solutions. The church says Caterpillar supplies products to Israel that are used to destroy Palestinian homes, Hewlett-Packard provides logistics and technology to help enforce the naval blockade of Gaza, and Motorola Solutions provides military and surveillance systems in illegal Israeli settlements. But immediately after the vote, church leaders said the decision was not a judgment against Israel. ""In no way is this a reflection for our lack of love for our Jewish sisters and brothers,"" Moderator Heath Rada said. The approved divestment proposal included a preface underscoring the denomination's longstanding commitment to peace in the region and the suffering on both sides. ""We recognize the complexity of the issues, the decades-long struggle, the pain suffered and inflicted by policies and practices of both the Israeli government and the Palestinian entities,"" it said. The church also stressed it still supports Israel and that the vote was not connected to the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, an international campaign to punish the Jewish state over the occupation of Palestinian lands and other hotly contested issues. Vote stirs passionate responses . But some Jewish organizations, even those that support a two-state solution to the ongoing crisis in the region, see the decision as a direct result of and support for the BDS movement. The American Jewish Committee (AJC) says the decision undermines the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. ""It is a very sad day for Presbyterian-Jewish relations when church leaders from across the U.S. align with the international Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement,"" Rabbi Noam Marans, the AJC's director of Interreligious and Intergroup Relations, said in a statement. ""This is an affront to all who are committed to a peaceful resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,"" Marans said. Rabbi Rick Jacobs, the president of the Union for Reform Judaism, issued a statement after the vote calling it ""a preference for a policy of isolation, rather than one of engagement."" ""Of course, we will continue to partner with our allies within the church who are committed to a two-state solution, reject the effort of the BDS campaign to delegitimize Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state, and work toward a just and fair solution to enable the Palestinians to achieve the state that they deserve,"" Jacobs said. The Anti-Defamation League called the move ""out of step"" with the majority of Presbyterians in churches across the United States. The ADL's National Director Abraham J. Foxman said the decision also creates an atmosphere of open hostility."" ""This resolution sends a painful message to American Jews and threatens the long-standing relationship between the Jewish community and the national Presbyterian Church with whom we have worked closely on many issues of mutual concern."" Some Presbyterians are condemning the vote, as well. The Rev. Katharine Rhodes Henderson, the president of New York's Auburn Seminary, is calling on Presbyterians opposed to the decision to reach out to their local Jewish communities to try to repair relationships following the controversial vote. Henderson said the vote ""sets back the work toward a just and peaceful resolution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict."" ""It hurts the Presbyterian place at the table for peacemaking, and creates barriers not just between Presbyterians and Jews, and Israelis and Palestinians, but also within the Presbyterian body."" Palestinian supporters of the BDS movement, meantime, said they are pleased with the church's divestment decision and see it as a sign the movement is gaining momentum in United States. Omar Barghouti, for one, calls the vote a ""sweet victory."" ""Presbyterian supporters of Palestinian rights have not only solidly introduced divestment from Israel's occupation to the U.S. mainstream, they have given the Palestinian people real hope in the face of the relentless cruelty of Israel's regime of occupation, settler colonialism and apartheid,"" said Barghouti, a founding committee member of the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel. Not a snap decision . The denomination, the largest Presbyterian body in the United States, says it still supports the Jewish state. ""We have significant investments in Israel,"" said church spokeswoman Kathy Francis. And the church is keeping them. The decision was about morality, not politics, she said. There are many Palestinian Christians in the occupied territories that the church is concerned about and obligated to support. Francis said the church no longer wanted to profit from investing in companies that have a hand in the destruction of people's homes and lives. Instead, she said, it will now shift some of its investments into economic development programs in the Palestinian territories. The divestment from the three companies was not a snap decision. The church has discussed and considered the issue for the past 10 years. It almost passed a divestment proposal at its 2012 assembly, narrowly voting it down by just two votes. Francis said the vote may make the Presbyterians seem unique among American Protestants, but  they are not alone. ""There are other denominations that are grappling with this,"" she said.","In a 310-303 vote, the church decides to pull $21 million in investments .
It is divesting from Caterpillar, Hewlett-Packard and Motorola Solutions .
Jewish groups, and some Presbyterians, condemn the decision .
The church is keeping other investments in Israel, while investing in Palestinian territories, too ."

"As the crisis in Syria enters its third year and the death toll exceeds 70,000, America's values and interests are increasingly at risk as others fill the void left by our inaction.  I saw this firsthand during a recent trip to the Middle East during which I met with Jordanians, Syrians and Israelis concerned about the fallout of a brutal civil war. In Jordan, the government and international aid agencies are scrambling to deal with more than 400,000 refugees fleeing the fighting, many of whom are women and children. Meanwhile, our allies in Israel are increasingly concerned about the nightmare scenario of chemical and advanced anti-aircraft weapons falling into the hands of terrorist groups such as Hezbollah or Islamist groups linked to al Qaeda. In April 2011, when the death toll stood in the low hundreds, I called on President Barack Obama to support the Syrian people's desires for freedom and an end to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime. I proposed a series of measures to immediately isolate al-Assad, including tough economic sanctions and severance of diplomatic ties.  Unfortunately, this and similar calls by Democrats and Republicans went unheeded at the time, only to be implemented by this administration months later -- slowly, hesitantly and ineffectually. There are now two conflicts underway in Syria. One is the battle to oust al-Assad.  The second is the emerging fight for control of a post-Assad Syria.  This latter fight will pit more moderate groups within the armed opposition against Sunni Islamists.  We need to ensure that the responsible actors win this battle and that Syria is no longer an ally of Iran and a staging point for destabilizing terror. America must not turn its back on the Syrian people.  Our interests are still served by the rapid resolution of the conflict and the removal of al-Assad from power. What might a successful Syria strategy look like? First, we cannot expect Syria's post-Assad rulers to respect our interests and wishes if we are not willing to support them in their fight.  While recent reports indicate that the rebels are increasingly in possession of much of the weaponry they have long sought, what they need now is ammunition.  We should do everything possible to get moderate elements within the opposition the ammunition, intelligence support, training and other equipment they need to help hasten al-Assad's fall. Ghitis: Syrian war is everybody's problem . While some worry that the Syrian opposition is entirely anti-American and made up of radicals, the reality is that Islamist forces remain in the minority.  Continued inaction, however, will only empower these anti-American elements of the opposition. We thus need to work more closely with groups such as the Syrian Opposition Council. The SOC has made great strides in unifying the more reasonable elements of the opposition and attempting to be inclusive of Syria's minorities, but it has suffered from slow and lukewarm support from Washington. The Obama administration should back their efforts to form a transitional government that can begin to govern rebel-controlled areas of Syria as soon as possible and put to rest any doubts about our support.  The additional nonlethal assistance to the SOC and to armed opposition groups announced by Secretary of State John Kerry in Rome on Thursday is a positive step, but much more needs to be done. Just as the Berlin airlift in the late '40s created a generation of Germans who remembered American support in their hour of need, Syrian children suffering today in refugee camps should understand that the U.S. government and American people care about their plight and are taking action to assist them. Although most of it cannot be traced back to us, the U.S. has actually provided hundreds of millions of dollars in humanitarian aid and nonlethal assistance since the conflict began.   However, in the camps outside of Syria, international aid agencies, often supported primarily by U.S. funds, have not made the source of their funding apparent to the refugees they are hosting.  Similarly, citing security concerns, the administration has been slow to brand U.S. assistance inside of Syria and make its origins clear to the populace. Even if these concerns are justified, there are ways to work with aid groups to utilize social media and with local leaders to highlight America's humanitarian assistance at work.  We should also be more willing to rely not just on international nongovernmental organizations and aid agencies, but also use the moderate groups we wish to strengthen as conduits for aid, helping them legitimize themselves with the Syrian people. We need decisive American leadership to avoid the worst outcomes in Syria. As one Syrian opposition figure recently told me, as long as ""the United States remains not present,"" the crisis is likely to only be prolonged. This may result in a post-Assad Syria that is a failed state in which Islamic radicals and Iranian agents with little interest in a liberal order flourish. For the sake of our security interests and the safety of our allies, we can and must do more to prevent such an outcome.","Marco Rubio: U.S. must step in with more assistance or other actors will fill void .

In recent years, however, this right, like so many others, has come under attack by the overzealous powers that be in Washington, eager to sacrifice liberty in the name of security, and using fear as a weapon to make us forget the importance of being free. In 2013, the revelation that the National Security Agency was collecting and storing the metadata from the phone calls and e-mails of millions of American citizens -- without any suspicion of criminal activity -- served as a striking wake-up call for the country. Americans do not like to think of their government as some Orwellian leviathan, engaging in surveillance tactics that we only expect to see in oppressive autocracies. That such surveillance could be going on in what is ostensibly the freest nation in the world is a chilling thought indeed. Since 2006, the NSA has been spying on us, treating American citizens as no more than common criminals, casting suspicion on honest people with not even a whisper of criminal activity about them. These are not the actions befitting a country that was once held up as a paragon of freedom and a model for the rest of the world. Online, live protests target NSA surveillance . We are told that these intrusive and unconstitutional measures are necessary to protect us from the forces of international terrorism. We are told that a surrender of our privacy rights is a small price to pay for the knowledge that we can sleep safe and secure in our beds. We reject this premise. We are committed to a safe America, but we do not accept the notion that a surveillance state is necessary to safeguard the lives and liberty of American citizens. These assurances of the necessity to give up a little privacy for the sake of safety are made all the less convincing by the fact that, after more than seven years, the NSA has been unable to provide any evidence that the collection of telephone metadata from Americans has led to the prevention of even a single terrorist attack. There can be no justification for the preservation of a domestic surveillance program that has utterly failed in its stated goals. In addition to the NSA's privacy violations, the existence of government spying serves as a significant obstacle toward citizens exercising their First Amendment rights to free speech. We have already seen government agencies like the IRS specifically target law-abiding citizens for their political views. The willingness of ordinary people to criticize the government will be greatly compromised by being under the constant, watchful eye of the government, and anyone deemed guilty of suspicious activity may consider an audit the least of their worries. For all these reasons, we have elected to file a class action suit on behalf of all Americans whose rights have been violated by the NSA's unconstitutional spying programs. We are requesting a ruling confirming that the blanket collection of Americans' telephone metadata without reasonable cause violates the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, and requiring that these programs be halted immediately and that all previously collected data be purged from government databases. It's time to hold government officials accountable for their habitual trampling on the Constitution and on our rights as individuals. Our case will be an important step down the road of restoring our Constitution and reining in our own overreaching federal government.","Sen.

"Rand Paul v. Barack H. Obama. That's the name of a lawsuit the Kentucky senator announced Wednesday against President Barack Obama and national security officials over government surveillance. ""We don't do this out of disrespect to anyone we do this out of respect to the Constitution,"" Paul said at a news conference. Paul's class-action suit, filed in federal court in Washington, was spurred by Edward Snowden's public disclosure last year that the NSA had gathered information on nearly every telephone call made in the United States since 2006. At a news conference, Paul called the legal challenge ""an important first step"" to ending the program that sweeps up numbers and other information known as metadata. With the suit, the son of Libertarian hero Ron Paul, who captured the hearts and minds of millions during his two presidential campaigns in 2008 and 2012, is rounding out his political persona through his Libertarian roots and adding another spoonful of political savvy. Paul v Candidate X . Paul v Obama in 2014 could be an effective way of helping Paul v the Democratic candidate in 2016, if he runs for President. Read the suit . It's no secret that Paul is considering such a step, but nothing's official yet. ""I keep looking at my schedule and I see New Hampshire, I see Iowa, I see South Carolina and I don't understand why I keep going to these states."" Paul said Sunday about the three key nominating states on Dallas TV station KXAS's program ""Lone Star Politics,"" according to the Dallas Morning News. Paul has crossover appeal on issues of war and national security that might help him down the road. According to a January poll by Quinnipiac, 48% of American support the phone surveillance program and 47% oppose. Similarly, 48% say it's necessary to keep Americans safe and 46% think it's not necessary. Additional polls show the split does not cut along party lines. And Paul's lawsuit is bursting with politics. Signed on to Paul's lawsuit is anti-establishment political organization FreedomWorks. Representing them is Ken Cuccinelli, Virginia's firebrand former attorney general, who lost his bid in November to be Virginia's governor. Paul is also promoting the suit through his political action committee, RandPAC, and while he said the legal move could impact hundreds of millions of people, he is asking 10 million of them to sign on to the class-action suit through his website. Asking for email addresses of class-action participants could be an effective way to increase a list of campaign supporters. ""Senator Paul can tap into those that are angry at the NSA and use the large number of class action participants to fundraise for a potential 2016 presidential run,"" Republican strategist Ron Bonjean said. In a CNN op-ed, Paul stayed away from politics and stuck to the policy prescription. ""It's time to hold government officials accountable for their habitual trampling on the Constitution and on our rights as individuals,"" he wrote. Opinion: Stop the NSA while we still can . Crossover appeal . While Paul's criticism of the government's surveillance programs has rankled both Democrats and Republicans who believe the program keeps Americans safe, he is also receiving bipartisan support. Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder of Tea Party Patriots, said Paul's suit follows his principles of limited government. ""I think it first and foremost is practical and necessary that we define the role of the NSA in terms of the Fourth Amendment in terms of today's modern technology,"" Martin said, praising Paul. On the other end of the political spectrum, the American Civil Liberties Union said it generally agrees with Paul's efforts to rein in the program. ""We agree with his view of the program and hope it will bring an end"" to the surveillance program, Patrick Toomey, an ACLU staff attorney, said. The ACLU also filed its own lawsuit six months ago against the program and hosted a day of action on Tuesday that resulted in 266,000 calls and emails to members of Congress opposing the mass surveillance program created to boost U.S. counterterror abilities. Paul gained national attention during a 13-hour filibuster last year of John Brennan, the nominee to lead the CIA when he also received praise from both conservatives and liberals. And after he announced his suit Wednesday, Paul had lunch to discuss restoring voting rights to ex felons, an issue that Paul has also drawn attention to and also crosses political ideologies. Hurdles . The efficacy of the suit is challenging, said legal analyst Alan Dershowitz. ""It's a serious legal issue,"" Dershowitz said on CNN's ""Wolf,"" adding that the issue will likely reach the Supreme Court but not via Paul's suit because of it's difficult to show that people were harmed by the surveillance. ""This is more of a political action than an action that has a chance of succeeding on its merits.""","Rand Paul filed a class action suit against President Obama over surveillance .

"(CNN)  -- The pilots of the commercial jetliner that last week overshot its destination by about 150 miles have said they were using their laptops and lost track of time and location, federal safety officials said Monday. The Airbus A320 was flying at 37,000 feet over the Denver, Colorado, area at 5:56 p.m. Wednesday when it last made radio contact, the safety board said. Northwest Flight 188 had departed San Diego en route to Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport carrying 144 passengers, two pilots and three flight attendants. Northwest recently merged with Delta Air Lines. ""Using laptops or engaging in activity unrelated to the pilots' command of the aircraft during flight is strictly against the airline's flight deck policies and violations of that policy will result in termination,"" Delta said Monday in a statement. Pilot Timothy B. Cheney, 53, was hired in 1985 and has more than 20,000 hours flight time; First Officer Richard I. Cole, 54, was hired in 1997 and has about 11,000 hours of flight time, the report said. Neither pilot reported having had an accident, incident or violation, neither had any ongoing medical conditions and neither said he was tired, it said. They each had a 19-hour layover in San Diego; neither said he had slept or argued during the flight, but both said ""there was a distraction"" in the cockpit, according to the report. The pilots said there was ""a concentrated period of discussion where they did not monitor the airplane or calls"" from air traffic control, though both said they heard conversation on the radio, the report said. Neither pilot said he noticed messages sent by company dispatchers, it added. It said the men were talking about the new monthly crew flight scheduling system put into place in the wake of Northwest's merger with Delta Air Lines. ""Each pilot accessed and used his personal laptop computer while they discussed the airline crew flight scheduling procedure,"" the report said. ""The first officer, who was more familiar with the procedure, was providing instruction to the captain.""Neither pilot said he was aware of where the plane was until a flight attendant called the cockpit about five minutes before the plane was to have landed and asked their estimated time of arrival, the report said. ""The captain said, at that point, he looked at his primary flight display for an ETA and realized that they had passed"" the airport, it added. After 78 minutes of radio silence, the pilots re-established radio contact with air traffic controllers, it said. After landing at Minneapolis-St. Paul, both voluntarily underwent alcohol breath tests, which proved negative, the report said. The safety board said its investigators interviewed the pilots separately Sunday in Minnesota for more than five hours combined. The investigation will include scrutiny of the flight and voice data recorders, it said. An airline spokesman said Monday the company has sent the passengers on the plane $500 travel vouchers to compensate them for their inconvenience, and that the pilots have been suspended until the conclusion of the investigations. The NTSB on Monday interviewed the three flight attendants who were on the plane, a spokesman for the Association of Flight Attendants said. The lead flight attendant told officers she was unaware there had been an incident aboard, according to the report. Police who met the wayward jet said the pilots were ""cooperative, apologetic and appreciative."" The NTSB is hoping the plane's cockpit voice recorder either will confirm the pilot's account or provide evidence of another possible explanation, including whether the captain and first officer fell asleep. Watch the co-pilot speak . The voice recorder is capable of recording only 30 minutes of audio, federal accident investigators said. The plane was in the air for another 45 minutes after radio contact was restored, meaning that if the recorder was working properly, anything the pilots would have said during the time they weren't answering radio calls would have been recorded over. But a former accident investigator said the voice recorder may still provide valuable information, because the pilots could have discussed the earlier events on the way back to Minneapolis after overshooting the airport. The flight data recorder also could prove valuable because it would have recorded actions taken by the pilots during the 78 minutes they did not respond to repeated calls from air traffic controllers, the ex-investigator said. Meanwhile, the North American Aerospace Defense Command, which scrambled fighter jets for the wayward plane but did not launch them, said it was reviewing procedures for launching the fighters to track potentially hijacked or suspicious aircraft. At issue is the Federal Aviation Administration's apparent delay in notifying NORAD the Northwest jet was not in contact with controllers, according to a senior U.S. official directly familiar with the timeline of the incident. Watch how the military is looking at a possible FAA delay . The official, who declined to be identified because the military and the FAA are reviewing the incident, said the FAA's request for military involvement came after the plane passed the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport. NORAD scrambled fighter jets at two locations. But as they approached the runway for takeoff, the FAA reported being back in contact with the Northwest flight, and the fighters stayed on the ground. ""My real question is why we did not know of the 'radio out' situation from the FAA sooner,"" the official said. ""The FAA is also looking into that."" Since the September 11, 2001, attacks, NORAD has regularly launched fighter jets to track aircraft in unusual situations such as when they deviate from flight plans, lose radio contact or enter restricted airspace. According to a second U.S. official, NORAD is in constant contact with the FAA so it can respond when situations arise. CNN's Mike M. Ahlers and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","NEW: Delta statement: ""Using laptops ... will result in termination""

"(CNN) -- On September 26, 43 student-teachers from the Ayotzinapa training college disappeared. Another three were found dead shortly afterward, one of them reportedly having had the skin stripped from his face. The students were in the town of Iguala, in southwest Mexico, on their way to protest the lack of school funding. The disappearances outraged Mexican society, driving citizens to protest en mass across the country. Popular opinion, that the crime was an act of state terrorism, has since been supported by reports that the students were abducted by local police on the order of Iguala's mayor, who has been charged, and were turned over to the gang that then killed them. Dozens of suspects have been arrested, including members of Iguala's municipal police force and Iguala's mayor and his wife, who reportedly have links with the Guerreros Unidos gang. Human Rights Watch called the Ayotzinapa incident the worst human rights crisis facing Mexico since the 1968 massacre of unarmed students at Tlatelolco. Yet this is only the most atrocious of many acts of state violence to have occurred since the Mexican government stepped up its war against the drug cartels. Much of the country has witnessed massacres resulting from confrontations between traffickers and agents of the state -- police and the armed forces -- or between rival groups of criminals for the control of routes and markets. The toll of this war on human life has been massive. According to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography there were 95,000 violent deaths in the country between 2006-2012, of which 60,000 are estimated to be associated with the drug war. In the same period, according to the Mexican Attorney General's Office, 25,000 people were reported missing. At the start of the crackdown on cartels, Mexico requested and received support from the United States in the form of the Mérida Initiative. Agreed on in March 2007, U.S. funding to Mexico increased from $40 million per year in the mid-2000s to $1.5 billion in stage one of the initiative. The focus of Mérida was to provide Mexican security forces with equipment and training to counter drug trafficking. In response to the criticism that stage one had not addressed capacity building and institutional reform, ""Beyond Mérida,"" or stage two, included resources to improve the rule of law and strengthen communities. The results, however, have been abysmal. The reality is that traffickers have taken advantage of the institutional weakness and corruption of municipal governments to control local police and politicians. The poverty and marginalization of the peasants -- who have no access to credit, have to pay high prices for seeds, fertilizers and transport for their products, and lack the technology necessary for crops with high market value -- create an opportunity for traffickers, who employ them in the production of opium poppies or cannabis. And although they are paid at low rates, their illicit incomes are still higher than what they would receive from traditional crops. If it weren't for prohibition, however, the illegal crops would not be profitable. Sadly, the absence of legal and moral limits is not exclusive to criminals, with state security forces committing atrocities under the pretext of the war on drugs. Most recently, in June, seven soldiers were charged over the extrajudicial execution of 22 alleged traffickers in Tlatlaya, a village not far from Iguala. According to witnesses, the victims had already surrendered. And this is by no means an isolated event -- extrajudicial executions are a recurrent practice of both the army and navy, involved in a war that respects neither human rights nor the existing legal order. Indeed, professors from the Center for Economic Research and Teaching and the National Autonomous University of Mexico recently noted, as one translation of their work notes, that when federal police confronted criminals, ""2.6 suspects died per every person wounded. When the army was involved, deaths increased to nine, and when the navy participated, the number rose to 17 fatalities per one wounded."" Meanwhile, after more than 10 years of the war on drugs, neither the supply nor the demand of illegal drugs has disappeared. In fact, there has not even been a reduction in supply on either side of the U.S. border. At the same time, in Mexico, the cartels have not gone away. In fact, they have multiplied as a result of fragmentation, while the level of violence has increased. The cases of Tlatlaya and Ayotzinapa are only the most visible tips of the iceberg, with a deep-spreading base that is quickly undermining the already troubled institutions of local government throughout Mexico. Violence is driving away investments that might otherwise bring development to marginalized zones even as the cartels, bolstered by the resources of the illicit drugs market, have diversified their activities and imposed Mafia-style protection rackets on legal markets. Ultimately, ending the failed war on drugs is now a matter of survival for Mexico. If Mexico is to recover peace and normality, resources now devoted to combating trafficking must be rechanneled into capacity building, institutional reform of local forces, and prosecution of predatory crime. In addition, a new drug policy focused on health, with an emphasis on prevention, harm reduction and treatment, must replace the focus on police and military persecution. The truth is that the war on drugs has caused more harm than good. It is time for it to end.","Jorge Javier Romero: Disappearance of 43 Mexican students led to protests .

"(CNN)Could you imagine a presidential election where two hopeful candidates had their campaigns run by the same communications firm? Welcome to the world of football where two men hoping to become the leader of FIFA, football's world governing body, are using the same campaign company despite ostensibly being in opposition. Luis Figo, the former Barcelona and Real Madrid midfielder and Jordan's Prince Ali Bin-Al Hussein have engaged London-based Vero Communications to help land them the top job. A public relations company with great experience in sport, Vero also has a wider communications brief working with UEFA, the European confederation within FIFA. Meaning truth in Latin, Vero has enjoyed great success helping Qatar win the hosting bid for the 2022 World Cup, running Brian Cookson's successful presidential bid for the International Cycling Union (UCI) and working with the city of Belo Horizonte during the World Cup in Brazil. Now it is set to play a key role in the presidential election --  by representing two of the candidates. Both men along with Dutchman Michael van Praag are hoping to bring an end to the 17-year reign of Sepp Blatter, who at the age of 78 is aiming for a fifth consecutive term in office. But why are Figo, one of the finest players of his generation and Ali, the Jordanian prince who sits on the FIFA Executive Committee, both using Vero to promote their campaigns? Responding to questions from CNN, Vero confirmed it was working on both campaigns. ""Vero is proud to be providing Prince Ali with strategic campaign and media relations support,"" said the statement. ""We also offer communications support, via the Portuguese Football Federation, to Luis Figo's campaign, and that includes his press conference in London this week. ""Vero also has an ongoing contract with UEFA, advising on a range of strategic communications matters. ""We share a common commitment with all three reforming candidates and UEFA to bring about positive change at FIFA."" FIFA did not immediately respond to CNN's questions as to whether Blatter was using a PR firm and how he was funding his re-election campaign . UEFA does not appear to have a problem with both the campaigns of Prince Ali and Luis Figo being run by the same company with the organization preferring to support a change of direction within FIFA rather than back one specific candidate. Rather than consider the two men opponents, the European governing body is believed to see the emergence of both Prince Ali and Figo as two men who are sharing the common goal of reforming FIFA and providing open and democratic debate. In a statement, UEFA told CNN: ""UEFA appointed Vero Communications as a consultant in March of 2014 to help support and develop its international communications activities. ""As part of the contract with UEFA, Vero deals with various matters concerning European and global football."" While van Praag's campaign is being run separately, all three candidates are expected to meet ahead of the election. UEFA president Michel Platini has been outspoken in his desire to see change at the top of world football and wants Blatter removed from the top job when the election takes place on May 29. He is likely to hold talks with the candidates a month or so before the election to see whether they have received enough support from the 209 national associations. It is thought that at least one of the three might pull out before the contest and instead pledge his votes to the candidate with the best chance of defeating Blatter. While FIFA's image has been tarnished by numerous scandals under Blatter's leadership, the Swiss remains favorite to retain his position. The resignation of ethics investigator Michael Garcia over the organization's handling of its own report into alleged corruption surrounding the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids brought great embarrassment. But Blatter's presidential rivals appear to have their work cut out to unseat the incumbent given the bedrock of support he enjoys, particularly in Africa. ""Blatter has been very key for the development of the game in Africa,"" Amaju Pinnick, head of the Nigerian Football Association told CNN. ""There's no fear. There are 54 countries -- I'm not going to say 100% that it's a secret ballot, it's not an open ballot, but everybody I've spoken to is in one direction. ""You need to decide that this man is an African, he feels African, he has supported Africa, and I will give him that support."" All four presidential candidates will be traveling to meet associations and hold talks over the election in the next couple of months. In an exclusive interview with CNN last month where he announced his intention to stand for president, Figo spoke of the need for change at the top of world football. The 42-year-old, who made 127 international appearances for Portugal, is admired by his fellow professionals and those who work within the game. ""I can say I'm a real candidate after today and I'm looking forward to opening the debate and trying to get the support of many federations to have the chance to be the president,"" added Figo. ""I think to [take] this step you have to be prepared. Of course I did my homework but I have a lot of things that I have to learn, to improve, but if your mind is open I think it's much more easy. ""I have my ideas about what is football and what is good for improving FIFA but I think my experience of my career is a positive thing that allows me to understand a lot of the game. My first priority is to know from the federations what they need. ""I think one important thing is to increase the solidarity payments to the federations, because right now FIFA has so many financial reserves that belong to the federations."" Prince Ali, who spoke exclusively to CNN earlier this month, said he would leave FIFA altogether if Blatter won re-election. ""I think the main point is to have a new culture"" Ali told CNN in an interview after he addressed the media for the first time since announcing his intention to run. ""It's about not having the game controlled by people's personal opinions or the whims of the president. It needs to be inclusive for all."" ""I've tried as much as I can to reform it from within... having seen what's happened I'm not going to allow another four years of this,"" Prince Ali added while talking about FIFA's internal workings.","Prince Ali bin Al-Hussein and Luis Figo both candidates in FIFA presidential election .

"We hire presidents to shoulder for us the weight of the world. Given the size and importance of their job, it's natural that we resent any time they spend not studying, discussing, thinking about or building support for the decisions they must make -- decisions that affect the lives of millions. How can a president ever feel well-enough informed? How can he turn off his desk light, close up shop and retire to the White House residence to help his children with their homework? Presidents belong to us. If the kids need help with homework, hire a tutor, whose time is not so precious. Except that it doesn't work that way. Until technology enables us to elect robots to the White House, we're stuck with presidents who, like the rest of us, are human beings, mere mortals who must spend time with family, unwind with friends, sleep, eat, veg out in front of the TV. Indeed, only a robot could perform so demanding a job without time spent away from it. Almost since he took office, President Barack Obama has faced criticism for a supposedly aloof style that causes him to neglect a key facet of his responsibilities. He lacks the human touch, goes this line of thinking, in a business that demands it. He refuses to attend to the care and feeding of the lawmakers whose votes he needs, and is reluctant to provide simple favors, such as posing for photographs, to the wealthy donors whose money he needs. Speaking to CNN's Jessica Yellin for the documentary ""Obama Revealed: The Man, The President,"" Obama denied that his apparent standoffishness results from an icy personality: ""Sometimes Michelle and I not doing the circuit and going out to dinners with folks is perceived as us being cool. It actually really has more to do with us being parents."" In other words, while he is America's only president, he is also his daughters' only father; his duty to them demands that he take time out from his duty to his country.  And so he makes sure that at 6:30 each evening he's seated at the family dinner table. After the meal, he helps his daughters with their homework. While the president's devotion to his family is something we can all admire, I wonder if he doth protest too much. It may be counterintuitive that people of elite status, whether by virtue of elective office or a hefty wallet, are so insecure that they need coddling before they will support a cause they believe in. But we all know that egos require stroking from time to time -- elite ones, perhaps, most of all.  It seems that Obama neglects that task less because of his devotion to his family than because of his distaste for the process. A recent New York Times profile of Obama's closest friend and adviser, Valerie Jarrett, revealed that the White House needlessly snubbed George Soros. Presumably acting at the president's behest, Jarrett turned down the liberal billionaire's request for a private meeting with Obama to discuss the economy. Whether or not that cold shoulder is the cause, Soros and his money are sitting this election out. With moguls such as the Koch brothers and Sheldon Adelson bankrolling super PACs on the other side of this tight race, Obama needs all the help he can get. While we may respect the president's disinclination to bow before great wealth, his failure to cultivate Soros may prove to be an expensive mistake. Bill Clinton, the last president in office with a child of grade-school age, tried to be present in his daughter's life. Craig Smith, a political consultant who worked for Clinton in Arkansas and Washington, recalled that when he and then-Gov. Clinton would travel for the day out of Little Rock they would start out at the Governor's Mansion: ""I'd get there in the morning and the first thing we would do is drop Chelsea off at school. He took Chelsea to school every day. He said, 'Let me give you a piece of advice if you're going to have a life in politics. Take your kids to school in the morning, because you never know what time you're going to get home at night.' "" As president, Clinton did spend time with his daughter during evenings when he could. Like Obama, he helped with the day's homework. When he was out of town, he'd supply the assistance by telephone. But unlike Obama, Clinton always found time to connect with people. While the self-contained current president is said to hold only a few friends close, the extroverted former president craves constant human contact. He would spend hours on the phone with members of Congress and his Cabinet, cajoling them on a vote or asking their advice or gaming out their appearance the next day on ""Meet the Press."" He also stayed in touch with friends -- from around the country, but particularly from Arkansas. When he couldn't make it to Little Rock to reconnect with home, home would come to him. Old friends would stay overnight at the White House, although they might not sleep much, given that games of hearts with the president would extend into the wee hours of the morning. As busy as they have been, all presidents have set aside personal time. Many -- Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, both Bushes, Clinton, Obama -- have played golf. Harry Truman took his daily constitutional and played poker with his pals. John F. Kennedy sailed. Nixon bowled. Ford swam. Jimmy Carter, perhaps the most diligent worker of the bunch, played tennis. Ronald Reagan rode his horse. George H.W. Bush drove his speedboat.  His son cleared brush. Lyndon B. Johnson found time for such activities as phoning a Texas clothier to order, in exacting and earthy detail, half a dozen pairs of pants. Nixon spent time, well-lubricated by Scotch whiskey, in Florida with his friend Cuban-American businessman Bebe Rebozo.  And, of course, Clinton and Kennedy put aside affairs of state to pursue affairs of a different nature. Clinton's obsessive need for human interaction led him to cross boundaries of appropriate behavior, and not just with Monica Lewinsky. Much to the consternation of those on the other end of the telephone, Clinton would call at all hours -- late in the evening, even well past midnight.

"A West Virginia man who fatally shot four people and then himself was apparently disappointed with people in his life, including his ex-girlfriend, Monongalia County Sheriff Kenneth ""Al"" Kisner told CNN on Tuesday. On Monday, Jody Lee Hunt, 39, of Westover, killed his ex, a man she was having a relationship with, a rival tow truck company owner and Hunt's cousin, Kisner said. Hunt shot himself to death in the woods, apparently using the same pistol, the sheriff said. When asked about Hunt's motive, Kisner said investigators looked at Hunt's Facebook page and found references to disappointments with people whom he considered friends. Kisner said Hunt also referred to a text from Michael Frum in which Frum said he was now dating Sharon Berkshire, Hunt's former girlfriend. Frum, 28, and Berkshire, 39, were found shot to death in the Cheat Lake area, CNN affiliate WDTV reported. Doug Brady, owner of another towing company, was shot to death at his business, WDTV reported. Hunt's cousin and partner in J&J Towing, 43-year-old Jody Taylor, was shot at Taylor's home, WTRF, a local station, said. Kisner said he didn't know the motive in the Taylor killing but noted that Brady and Hunt were vying for business throughout the county. Hunt planned to talk soon to a county commissioner because Hunt claimed another towing company had picked up an overturned truck when it was Hunt's company's turn in the rotation, WTRF reported. The sheriff said he wants to know how Hunt obtained a firearm, because the shooter had a criminal record. He had been imprisoned twice for firearms violations, Kisner said. In 2001, Hunt was convicted of wanton endangerment with a firearm and sentenced to five years in the West Virginia prison system, Kisner said. Hunt was convicted of abduction and use of a firearm in the commission of felony in 1999 and sentenced to three years in prison . Kisner said Hunt dated Berkshire about two years before they broke up. Berkshire filed domestic protection orders against Hunt in 2013 and 2014 but dismissed the orders and resumed the relationship with Hunt, WTRF reported, citing Kisner.","Sheriff: A  man killed his ex-girlfriend, a man she was dating, a business rival and a business partner .

"(CNN) -- Africa is facing the worst Ebola outbreak in history and it's arrival in America has prompted many people to finally take notice of the deadly disease. In Africa, especially Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, thousands continue to suffer. More than 5,000 people have died from the virus since March, and the CDC estimates that by the end of January there could be 1.4 million Ebola cases. Aid organizations are on the ground and in desperate need of assistance to stop this growing epidemic. They are mainly providing health care services, educational programs and delivering medical supplies. Here are some groups fighting this deadly disease and information on how you can make an impact. AmeriCares has been sending shipments to the region since the outbreak began. They are providing critical antibiotics, medical supplies and safety equipment for health workers including gloves and protective masks. There are more than 500 Samaritan's Purse staff in Liberia working to decrease the spread of the Ebola virus. The organization is providing administrative and logistical support and continues with Ebola public awareness and education. Since March, UNICEF and its partners have reached at least 5.5 million people in West Africa. They sent about 550 tons of supplies in the last few weeks, including protective equipment, hygiene items and essential medicines. Thousands of International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent volunteers have been trained and deployed to support the response. They help dispose of dead bodies, trace the path of the disease and provide emotional support to the communities affected by the disease. They plan on training more than 5,600 volunteers to ensure larger geographical areas can be reached. The main focus of Nothing But Nets is fighting Malaria, the leading cause of death among children in Africa. But since the Ebola outbreak, the threat of Malaria is on the rise. They are sending health workers to communities to provide critical malaria prevention, as well as diagnostic and treatment services. Doctors without Borders West Africa Ebola response started in March and now has activities in five countries: Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal and Sierra Leone. They currently employ 239 international and 2,000 locally hired staff in the region. The organization operates six Ebola management centers providing more than 500 hospital beds in isolation. Since the beginning of the outbreak, they have treated over 1,700 Ebola patients, and 520 have survived. More than 435 tons of supplies have been shipped to the affected countries. International Medical Corps has established a 70-bed treatment unit in Bong County, Liberia and is also opening a 50-bed treatment unit in Lunsar, Sierra Leone. In addition, teams are delivering critical personal protection equipment and training for local health workers on infection control and patient care. Save the Children works in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia to help prevent the spread of the virus, by training health workers, teaching tens of thousands of people in communities about how to limit the risks to themselves and their families, distributing protective kits, and providing much needed medical equipment. World Vision staff in Sierra Leone are organizing major public awareness and prevention campaigns to protect children from the disease through radio, public events and interfaith workshops. World Vision also is delivering massive numbers of medical relief supplies, including 4 million pairs of gloves, to Sierra Leone, to support health workers. Catholic Relief Services has been responding to the outbreak since earlier this year, and has staff in all the affected countries. They are providing medical supplies and training to healthcare workers and volunteers. They are also working with local leaders to raise awareness about Ebola. Operation Blessing International is responding to the Ebola outbreak by sending American aid workers, multiple chlorine generators and shipping containers full of hospital linens and protective gear. The World Food Programme has provided food and assistance to more than 430,000 people affected by the Ebola crisis. Rice, lentils, cooking oil and rations are being distributed, food for hospital patients is cooked by partner organizations, and quarantined populations get the food and take it home to prepare. ChildFund International helped to open the first Interim Care Center that provides a safe place for children during the 21-day quarantine period after their last contact with someone infected with Ebola. The center is staffed with a nurse, social and mental health workers, and eight Ebola survivors, serving as caregivers and working with children to alleviate the trauma and stigma of losing a family member to Ebola. ChildFund is working with health officials and the government to establish additional Interim Care Centers as the emergency continues. The UN Foundation Ebola Response Fund provides technical assistance to governments of Ebola-affected countries through field personnel and infection prevention and control experts. They also help deliver much needed supplies such as personal protective equipment and chlorine. International Rescue Committee staff and community health workers in Liberia and Sierra Leone are working to educate people on how to stop the spread of the virus. They are also bolstering local health systems with medical staff, protective gear and logistical support. Project Concern International or PCI has been fighting Ebola in Liberia since the outbreak began in March. The group was already in Liberia working with feeding programs and just switched gears to tackle raising public awareness of Ebola, training health care workers and providing medical supplies from bleach to hazmat suits. PCI has helped educate more than 140,000 people on how to prevent Ebola infection.","Officials say this is the deadliest Ebola outbreak in history .

"(CNN) -- The Civil Air Patrol has called off the search for multimillionaire adventurer Steve Fossett, nearly a month after he took off from a Nevada ranch, the agency announced Tuesday. Adventurer Steve Fossett has been missing since September 3. Fossett, 63, was last seen September 3 when he left hotel magnate Barron Hilton's private Minton, Nevada, ranch in a single-engine plane. He was reported missing after his Bellanca Super Decathlon failed to return from the flight. Fossett was said to be scouting test sites for a future attempt at breaking the land speed record. In a statement announcing the end of the effort, the Civil Air Patrol said rescuers covered 20,000 square miles in an effort to locate Fossett -- ""one of the largest, most intensive searches for a missing aircraft in modern history."" ""The Civil Air Patrol joins the rest of the aviation world and admirers worldwide in its disappointment in not locating Steve Fossett,"" said Brig. Gen. Amy S. Courter, the agency's acting national commander. Fossett was the first man to fly around the world in a balloon alone and the first solo pilot to circle the globe without refueling. He holds 14 world records in airplane flight, two for ballooning, six in gliders and one in an airship, in addition to 11 records for sailing and one for cross-country skiing. ""This remarkable man showed us what grit and determination are all about,"" Courter said. ""In his life, he chased and shattered world records, floating and flying farther and faster than anyone before. His adventures are many and his accomplishments profound. We regret that those adventures may have come to an end."" The search was scaled back September 19, but rescuers said they would continue to pursue tips sent by phone and e-mail.

"Once a sleepy tropical paradise with little more than handful of ramshackle beach huts, the island of Boracay, in the Philippines' Malay Province, has emerged from the backpacker trail to become one of Asia's hottest holiday destinations. In 2012, Travel + Leisure honoured it with the title ""World's Best Island."" Although Boracay now hosts a wide range of resorts with even more under development, it's the combination of seemingly endless stretches of white sandy beach and clear azure water that keeps visitors coming back. The island packs more than a dozen beaches into a surface area of just over 10 square kilometers (3.9 square miles). Here's a selection of some of the best. White Beach . The beach that put Boracay on the map is a five-kilometer expanse of white powdery sand, much of which is in fact finely ground coral. White Beach is divided into three ""stations"" which date back to a quieter time when boats would glide through White Beach's shallow waters to deliver visitors to Boracay directly onto the sand before Cagban Jetty Port on the island's south east tip was built. Today White Beach is Boracay's most developed stretch of shore, lined with resorts, hotels, bars, restaurants and even a shopping mall. The most expensive resorts, such as Discovery Shores are at the far end of Station One on the northern end of the beach (which also boasts White Beach's finest sand, often painstakingly raked and manicured by resort staff). More budget-friendly establishments are to be found along Station Three with accommodation along Station Two falling in the mid-range bracket. Boracay is known for its spectacular sunsets. Due to White Beach's west-facing orientation, it's an ideal place to watch the sun sink into the ocean. After dark, White Beach has a lively party scene. Each month's festivities peak with full moon and black moon parties. Party destinations range from Epic, the beach's biggest club, on the edge of Stations One and Two, to nearby Aplaya Beach Bar, with its Mediterranean vibe. Then there's the debauched Cocomangas, where partygoers can binge drink for national pride -- those foolish enough to drink 15 different shots of alcohol get their name and nationality on a small plaque on the bar's wall. Many bars along the Station Two have live music, which is of the consistently high standard that has led to Filipino musicians finding work in hotel bars the world over. Bulabog Beach . The Island of Boracay resembles an eight-kilometer-long chicken drumstick that someone has taken a bite out of. With this in mind, Bulabog Beach lies on the eastern side of the long thin middle section of the island (the bone of the drumstick). Opposite White Beach, Bulabog Beach greets the rising sun. At the island's narrowest point, it's less than a 700-meter walk from its more glamorous and developed cousin and, at 2.5 kilometers, about half its length. From November to April, Bulabog Beach bears the brunt of a blustery northern monsoonal wind known as the amihan. While wind-blown fine sand and debris rule the beach out as a place to sunbathe during amihan, its choppy waters are ideal for watersports such as kite boarding and windsurfing. The beach is lined with kite boarding schools, small bars catering to the kitesurfing and windsurfing crowd along with accommodation for kite boarding students and budget conscious travelers who want to avoid the crowds of White Beach. Yapak Beach (Puka Shell Beach) More commonly referred to on the island as Puka Beach, this 800-meter-long stretch of glistening white sand on Boracay's northern tip is arguably Boracay's most beautiful beach. Its sand is coarser than White Beach's due the high content of small puka shells. Upon arrival by road, visitors are greeted by of stalls selling locally made shell jewelry and shell souvenirs. Yapak Beach has thus far escaped the rampant development seen on Boracay's main beach and its coconut-palm-lined shores give visitors a feeling of what the island was like when it was known only to a lucky few. Banyugan Beach . Technically the private beach of Shangri-La's Boracay Resort and Spa, this attractive 100-meter-long sheltered stretch of fine white sand to the west of Yapak Beach is framed by two high rocky outcrops and features comfortable sunbeds with large umbrellas and attentive waiters. Banyugan is accessible to non-guests, although it's advisable to make a reservation for one of the Shangri-La's bars or restaurants beforehand. Banyugan Beach is also a great snorkeling spot with large shoals of fish just offshore. Kayaks and TUSA brand snorkeling gear are available for hire. Mask and snorkel use is free to guests of the resort. Ilig Iligan Beach . This small secluded beach, also far from the crowds of White Beach, is located in the upper north eastern tip of the island around the corner from Yapak Beach and on the opposite side of the island to Banyugan Beach. More protected from northern winds than Bulabog Beach, with two small rocky islands just off its northern edge, amihan still represents the off season for Ilig Iligan Beach's two small resorts. During this time the beach is lined with colourful fishing boats under repair. The best time to visit is from May to October, when the monsoon winds shift to the southwest, the season known as habagad. Once the sea calms, Ilig Iligan Beach offers scenic snorkeling, but be warned: the beach has a strong current and is better suited to experienced swimmers.","White Beach, the most developed on Boracay, is the shoreline that put the island on the tourist map .
Being constantly raked and cared by resort staff, Station Three boasts the best sand on White Beach .

"The United Kingdom may have raised its terror threat level, but the streets of London don't appear to be fazed. Londoners and tourists did not let the announcement Friday affect their weekend plans. Public transportation hubs were bustling, tourists attractions were crowded and visible police presence was low. ""If you let things like that rule your life, you'd never do anything. So although you're aware of it, you hope that the government is on top of the situation,"" said Carl Toon, passing through King's Cross station with his family. Jodie O'Rourke, an events manager in London, echoed that sentiment. ""You don't think every time you get on the tube there's anything going to happen,"" she said. In response to events in Iraq and Syria, where ISIS militants have seized a large swath of territory, the UK government increased the country's threat level from ""substantial"" to ""severe,"" the fourth highest of five levels. ""That means that a terrorist attack is highly likely, but there is no intelligence to suggest that an attack is imminent,"" Home Secretary Theresa May said. While it's been widely reviled internationally, ISIS has managed to attract some support among Muslims and has drawn foreign fighters. Even without specific threats in the West, ISIS' track record in Syria and Iraq -- where it was known to massacre minorities, forcefully institute Sharia law and stage executions and stonings -- suggest it may be capable of anything. Prime Minister David Cameron said the group  poses a ""greater and deeper"" threat than Britain has ever known. ""This is al Qaeda version 6.0,"" Ryan Crocker, a former U.S. ambassador to Iraq and Syria, told CNN on Friday. ""They are like nothing we have ever seen before."" Fears of a Muslim witch hunt in the UK? But not all are buying the government's dire predictions. ""I think it's just trying to make people scared really, that's all it is, said Dill Shawki, a Ph.D student in London. ""Make people scared and they'll be more likely to support something if the government then eventually did try to go into Iraq."" Cameron's pledge to crack down on radical Islam is leaving some feeling uneasy, fearing that it could turn into a witch hunt against all Muslims in the UK. ""Being a Muslim is synonymous with being a terrorist nowadays,"" said Antara Muhajimi, wearing a full face veil in London's East End. ""People are scared of what they don't know most of the time,"" she said, ""They attack [Islam] because they don't know it. It's just part of human nature."" ""Adhering to British values is not an option or a choice; it is a duty for those who live in these islands,"" said Cameron. ""And in the end it is only by standing up for these values that will defeat the extremism, protect our way of life and keep all our people safe."" ""Regarding these 'British values,' Muhajimi said, ""I wouldn't know what they are, I only know what my values are, and how to treat other people with them. ""Kindness and patience and acceptance, that's what's going to keep a community together,"" she said. Travel restrictions, an increase in police activity . Cameron said military force is among the tools that can be used against ISIS, while adding that aid, diplomacy and political influence should also be part of Britain's response. That said, his focus Friday wasn't so much about what to do about ISIS overseas as it was keeping British citizens back home safe. The Prime Minister vowed he will soon announce plans to stop would-be jihadists from traveling to Syria and Iraq and to make it easier to take their passports away. Britain also needs to do more to stop current fighters from returning from the Middle East and to deal decisively with those who already have returned, he said. UK authorities estimate that 500 Britons have gone to Syria and Iraq to fight with Islamist groups. Britain's national policing lead for counterterrorism, Mark Rowley, said -- while the threat level just went up Friday -- police have been escalating their efforts to combat the jihadist threat for months. He claimed 69 arrests in the first half of 2014 for offenses ranging from funding ""terrorist activity through to the preparation and/or instigation of terrorism acts and traveling abroad for terrorist training."" CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen says Britain likely hiked its terror threat level because ""there's no way you can track 500 people."" At the same time, he downplayed the idea that Friday's announcement means an attack is imminent. ""This is what governments are paid to do: They are paid to worry about their citizens,"" Bergen said, noting that the UK threat level has gone up before without a subsequent attack. ""That doesn't mean their citizens should be in a constant state of worry."" Obama's no 'strategy yet' comment on ISIS in Syria sparks a political uproar .","Despite rise in threat level, London's streets remain packed .

"Sen. Ted Cruz slammed the White House on Tuesday for a ""failure of leadership"" as President Barack Obama prepares to nominate his administration's fourth defense secretary. The Texas Republican, who is considering a 2016 run in hopes of heading his own White House administration, called the unusually high turnover at the helm of the Defense Department emblematic of a White House that puts politics above U.S. national security. ""It seems what the administration is looking for is a defense secretary who will follow the orders of a political White House rather than focus on defending the national security interests of this country,"" Cruz said. ""At a time when the threats are this grave, we shouldn't see turnover at the Defense Department than one has at a typical Burger King."" Cruz said he did not know Ashton Carter, the former No. 2 man at the Pentagon who is expected to be Obama's nominee to succeed Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, but Cruz said he looks forward to learning more about Carter and his ""good reputation."" But Cruz emphasized he was unsettled to see several potential picks pull their names out of the running to head the department, including former Pentagon official Michele Flournoy and Sen. Jack Reed. ""It says something that so many people are saying, 'No, thank you, I don't want to serve in an administration that overrides the Defense Department, that treats the defense secretary as subservient to political lackeys in the White House,"" Cruz said. Cruz made the remarks Tuesday at an event cosponsored by Concerned Veterans of America and the conservative publication The Weekly Standard during which he bore out his hawkish foreign policy and staked out positions starkly in contrast to Obama. McCain: Ashton Carter won't be heard at W.H. Drawing often from neoconservative Sen. John McCain, Cruz laid out a foreign policy focused on reasserting U.S. power and values in the world and ""resolutely defending"" U.S. national security. And the first-term Texas senator also pulled from the pages of the Powell Doctrine, saying leaders should engage the U.S. military with a ""clear and stated objective upfront"" and attack with ""overwhelming force ... and then we should get the heck out."" Cruz also mocked the Obama administration's failed ""reset"" with Russia and repeated his claim that Russian President Vladimir Putin is a ""KGB thug,"" criticizing Obama's response to Russian military action in Crimea with disbelief. ""You literally cannot make this stuff up. If 'Saturday Night Live' were parodying a hapless, ineffective President, they couldn't make things up worse,"" Cruz said. Cruz also repeated his claim that the potential for a nuclear Iran is the ""gravest national security threat"" to the U.S. right now and likened the U.S. policy to combating ISIS as ""nonsense."" Foreign policy is shaping up to be a top issue in the 2016 presidential election as the ISIS threat, Iran nuclear negotiations and sanctions and continued tensions between the U.S. and Russia loom large. About 54 percent of Americans disapprove of Obama's handling of foreign affairs, according to a CNN poll released last week.","Sen.

"First light creeps over Chobe National Park as I climb groggily into a Land Rover and head out for an early morning game drive. On any other African safari you would expect to hear the roar of a diesel engine as the hulking vehicle shudders into gear, breaking the stillness of dawn. But on this morning, our guide Lebo starts the Landy unnoticed and we glide silently away from the lodge, off to see elephants and lions in an almost zen-like quietness. I've been to wildlife reserves all over Africa but this, for me, is a first. An electric safari. Not only is it kinder to the environment, but -- as I discovered during my stay at Chobe Game Lodge -- a far better way to see wild animals. In the lodge's converted electric Land Rover, silent and smooth, we hear every bird, every rustle of the bush. Lebo stops so we can take photos of the brilliant orange sunrise; we then continue quietly along, listening to the alarm calls of baboons and the chatter of guinea fowl descending from their roost. Such an experience is a rare thing indeed. Chobe Game Lodge, located inside the national park on Botswana's northern border with Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe, launched what it describes as the world's first electric safari fleet in late November. The lodge is rolling out both electric game drive vehicles -- retrofitted Land Rovers -- and electric boats, for game-viewing cruises along the Chobe River. Huge elephant population . The power supply comes from the hydroelectric grid supplied by southern Africa's mighty Victoria Falls. Chobe's fleet is being converted to electricity by a South Africa-based firm called Freedom Won. The lodge's general manager hit on the idea after reading an article about the company's work. Antony English, a Freedom Won co-owner, says electric vehicles are well suited to game viewing, and ""just so kind to our environment."" The converted Land Rovers are rugged and perform well on Chobe's sandy trails. The first vehicle put into operation -- our ride for the day -- has been dubbed ""Freedom 3."" ""Most of you will have been on a game drive, and you would have had to put up with the diesel motor and the noise, and the vibration and smoke,"" English says. ""Just think about that when you drive Freedom 3, and think about the contrast."" Chobe is special because of the concentration of game along the riverfront, giving visitors the option of both game drives on land and cruises on the water. The national park is also known for its large elephant population, with upwards of 120,000 elephants in the Chobe area. The best time to visit is during the May to October dry season, when animals gather near the river. When the rains come, the herds disperse into the bush. The upside is that there are few tourists, the downside is scant wild animals to be seen. In front of the Chobe Game Lodge, running above the river, is a long boardwalk punctuated by seating and viewing areas from which visitors can spot grazing hippos, plus warthogs, impalas and all sorts of bird life. Liz Taylor's honeymoon suite . It's easy to see why the actress Elizabeth Taylor fell in love with this place, visiting Chobe Game Lodge repeatedly and even marrying Richard Burton -- for the second time -- on the river's edge. (A tip for Liz Taylor fans: request room 210 to stay in her honeymoon suite, the most private of all rooms, with its own plunge pool and terrace.) The five-star lodge's decor has been updated since the 1975 wedding, so -- perhaps mercifully -- none of the Taylor-era feel is preserved. Now there's an airy Zanzibar-inspired design, complete with oversized cushions, wooden frames and vintage lanterns. Most international visitors to Chobe will arrive at the small Kasane International Airport, 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) from the lodge, connecting from either Johannesburg in neighboring South Africa, or from Botswana's capital Gaborone. Both are about a two-hour flight away. Kasane is probably the only airport in Africa to have its own parking bay for electric vehicles -- a new addition, with the lodge intending to use electric Land Rovers for ferrying guests. Day trips are possible from Chobe to Victoria Falls, on the Zambian-Zimbabwean border, only 90 minutes away. Jonathan Gibson, CEO of the company that owns Chobe Game Lodge, and a board member for the national park, worries about the growing number of big polluting boats on the Chobe River, and general crowding in the riverfront area. He and the Chobe board want river traffic restricted to electric boats, with the exception of fishing boats and local ferries, within three years. ""This is the way to go,"" Gibson says. ""It's going to revolutionize what happens on the river here."" On land there are safari vehicle traffic jams, mostly polite though some tourists lose the plot. I watched as a khaki-clad German visitor screamed at another group of tourists for momentarily blocking his distant view of sleeping lions. As in most other national parks, vehicles aren't allowed off the tracks at Chobe, in order to protect the natural environment. Sounds of silence . As the only lodge within the national park's boundaries, Chobe Game Lodge is well positioned. Morning drives and afternoon cruises generally start a half-hour early to get a head start on the other tourists. All of the guides are women, highly unusual at game lodges across Africa. The lodge also offers a more unusual tour. Albert Ndereki, 62, a longtime employee, leads an eco-tour that takes guests behind the scenes, into the kitchen, laundry room and other places a tourist would never normally visit. Ndereki proudly explains the process of recycling glass bottles into cement bricks used for building, reusing gray water for the garden, and shows off the interesting (though rather smelly) bio gas plant, in which food waste is converted into methane gas used for cooking. ""This is our park,"" Ndereki tells us. ""We have to look after it."" On a late-afternoon river cruise, we experience the sounds of silence again. As our electric boat turns a bend, we spot a herd of elephants tentatively coming down to the river for a drink of water. An African fish eagle sits motionless as we glide by. A crocodile basking on the shore's edge doesn't move either, until a grumpy elephant decides to chase it away. We sit watching and listening to the elephants as dusk settles over the Chobe River. But the next morning is a rude awakening: back to a bumpy old diesel-fueled Land Rover for our final game drive through the park. The lodge's fleet is still being converted to electric and it is a slow process, though the plan is to have a total of 13 game drive vehicles and six boats. Our guide catches sight of a Jacobin Cuckoo and we pull up to get a better look, our diesel motor roaring. The bird flees. My seatmate puts down his camera, grumbling: ""It would still be there if we were in the electric vehicle.""

"Incumbent Sen. Mary Landrieu, a Democrat, and Republican challenger Rep. Bill Cassidy traded sharp allegations of personal misconduct in the final debate before the Louisiana Senate runoff, scheduled for Saturday, Dec. 6. Days before the debate, Landrieu attacked Cassidy's medical record, alleging the three-term congressman and doctor padded his payroll by manipulating his time sheet at the Louisiana State University clinic where he practices. Defending his service, Cassidy admitted he filled out the records himself. ""Whenever you go to a clinic, you fill out charts and you sign sheets, and everybody knows where you are,"" Cassidy said. But Landrieu was persistent with her allegations. ""I think that you owe the taxpayers an explanation for why you took $174,000 -- which is your salary -- plus $20,000, plus we believe - and until we get all the records -- they also paid for his medical malpractice,"" she asserted. ""He's the only doctor in the Congress that has this sweetheart deal. The only one."" But in addition to defending himself, Cassidy was quick to fire back at Landrieu for using taxpayer dollars to fund her private campaign transportation, a violation for which she has apologized and reimbursed taxpayers for. ""When I treat patients in the public hospital system, clearly those patients benefit,"" Cassidy said. ""When she takes chartered jets on taxpayer dime to campaign events, who is it that benefits?"" The contenders also predictably disagreed about other hot-button policy issues, particularly the Affordable Care Act. Defending her vote for the bill in 2010, Landrieu admitted that while she supported President Barack Obama's signature law, ""it should be improved."" Cassidy, on the other hand, echoed the Republican mantra that the law should be ""repealed and replaced."" In addition to highlighting that Landrieu has voted with the President ""97 percent of the time,"" Cassidy also tried to tie Landrieu to Jonathan Gruber, who served as an adviser during the law's drafting and whose controversial comments about the law and its passage have set off a conservative firestorm. But Landrieu rejected the association. ""I don't read what Jonathan Gruber says, I don't even talk to Jonathan Gruber,"" she said. ""I talk to my constituents."" Tensions also flared over the Keystone XL pipeline and energy policy, gun rights, abortion and racial issues in light of the Ferguson, Missouri, shooting tragedy. Responding to Landrieu's suggestion that the President's unpopularity in Southern states may be attributable to historical racial bias, Cassidy said, ""Just because you disagree with the President, doesn't make you a racist."" Landrieu finished just ahead of Cassidy in the all-party primary on Nov. 4, but couldn't draw a majority of the vote, sending the race to a runoff that will be decided on Saturday. The breakdown of Senate seats starting in January 2015 is now 53 held by Republicans, 44 Democrats and two independents, with the Louisiana Senate race the only undecided contest remaining.  ​ .","Incumbent Sen.

""I think we are very close to the point of no return,"" Poroshenko said Saturday following an EU summit in Brussels. ""The point of no return is full-scale war, which already happened in the territory controlled by separatists and where -- instead of separatists -- there are regular Russian troops."" Poroshenko said the situation had worsened in the last few days and that thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on Ukrainian territory. Russia has repeatedly denied either supporting the rebels or sending its own troops over the border. But those assertions have been roundly rejected by the West. European Council President Herman Van Rompuy, speaking at the summit, said new sanctions will be proposed. ""The European Council says that it stands ready to take further significant steps in the light of the evolution of the situation on the ground and it requests the commission to urgently undertake preparatory work ... and present proposals for consideration within a week,"" Rompuy said. Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared defiant in the face of a chorus of Western condemnation over what NATO says is clear evidence of Russian military aggression in Ukraine. Moscow doesn't want or intend to wade into any ""large-scale conflicts,"" Putin said Friday at a youth forum, state-run Itar-Tass reported. A few breaths later, he made the point that Russia is ""strengthening our nuclear deterrence forces and our armed forces,"" making them more efficient and modernized. ""I want to remind you that Russia is one of the most powerful nuclear nations,"" the President said. ""This is a reality, not just words."" German Chancellor Angela Merkel and U.S. President Barack Obama agreed in a phone call Thursday that they would have to consider tougher action against Russia. The European Union and the United States have already slapped economic sanctions on targeted Russian individuals and businesses. The union also has sanctioned certain sectors of the Russian economy, prompting Russia to retaliate with its own measures. Port city fortifies . The Ukrainian military worked to fortify the port city of Mariupol after Russian intelligence groups were observed there, Col. Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian National Defense and Security Council, said Saturday. A CNN team saw Ukrainian forces strengthening defensive positions on the eastern outskirts of the city, reinforcing checkpoints and digging trenches along roads leading toward the Russian border. Beyond these checkpoints, the team found a small advance detachment of Ukrainian troops on the main road about halfway between Mariupol and Novoazovsk. The soldiers said it had been quiet Saturday. The CNN team encountered the first pro-Russian rebel roadblock a short distance outside Novoazovsk, about 12 miles (20 kilometers) from the Russian border, with concrete blocks across the road and a heavy machine gun among the weaponry. A 12.7 mm heavy machine gun was among the weapons at the roadblock. The fighters would not allow the CNN team to pass through but said they should ""come back tomorrow."" There is a large stretch of territory east of Mariupol, some 15-30 kilometers wide depending on location, that is occupied by neither Ukrainian forces nor pro-Russian fighters. In the villages between the two ""front lines"" there are no signs of damage. Some stores are open and there is some civilian traffic on the roads. Long queues have formed at one checkpoint out of Mariupol as people from rural areas try to get in and out of the city. Denials 'without credibility' Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in March, following the ouster of pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych the previous month. Violence broke out in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions in April, as separatist leaders declared independence from the government in Kiev. Since mid-April, the conflict between the pro-Russia rebels and the Ukrainian military has cost more than 2,500 lives, according to the United Nations. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Friday that -- whatever the Kremlin says -- the reality is Russian troops are inside Ukraine and have fired on Ukrainian military positions. See the NATO satellite images . In response, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said NATO had previously used ""images from computer games"" to -- in his view -- falsely make the case that Russian troops are in Ukraine, and said the ""latest accusations are pretty similar.""","European Union leader: More sanctions against Russia to be considered .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN)What would Katniss do? The central figure in ""The Hunger Games,"" the hit sci-fi series about an oppressed people's struggle against a totalitarian regime, is being evoked for real, now, in Thailand among university students expressing their opposition to that southeast Asian nation's military rulers. Several students, from Bangkok to about 450 kilometers (280 miles) away to the northeast, have been detained in recent days after flashing the signature anti-establishment, three-fingered salute from""The Hunger Games."" By Thursday evening, all of those held had been released, according to lawyers. At that point, according to Human Rights Watch's Sunai Phasuk, about 100 police and military troops had congregated then at a busy cinema in the Thai capital where ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1"" was set to debut. 'Prohibited by martial law' Asked about the arrests of students who flashed the salute and others accused of organizing a protest meeting revolving around the Jennifer Lawrence-starring movie, a government official told CNN that the ""military is working on reducing conflicts from various political groups."" Allowing such political statements, he said, could inflame tensions in the unsettled nation. ""Seeing a movie is a personal thing, and they all have a right to do that,"" said Maj. Gen. Sansern Kaewkumnerd. ""But if, after seeing the movie, there are political activities involved, this is prohibited by martial law, which has been imposed since (last May's) military intervention."" Sansern added, ""If we allow one group to hold political activities, then (other) groups would want to do the same thing. We would never achieve peace and order, which we are trying to restore."" Yet there's little indication the opposition is going away, nor is there anything like national elections on the immediate horizon suggesting a return to civilian rule. Military takes over in Thailand . Opposition uses pop culture . Such political turmoil is hardly new to Thailand. Its military has attempted 19 coups -- 12 of them successful -- in the past 80 years. The world, of course, has changed a lot over that time, as have the tools and inspirations of opposition groups. One protest leader, Sombat Boonngamanong, has been especially pivotal in using pop culture references straight out of Hollywood to spread the movement's message. That includes the story of Katniss Everdeen -- a teenage girl who competes in a spectacle of blood lust known as the Hunger Games and becomes a leader in the revolution against a tyrannical government. A ""Hunger Games"" fan club, which consists of university students calling for democracy in Thailand, had planned to meet for the latest film's showing Thursday at one Bangkok theater. But the showing at that theater and three others that are part of the same Apex chain was canceled -- for ""technical"" reasons, according to the chain. Ratthapon Supasopon, from the League of Liberal Thammasart for Democracy, said the theater's management gave them refunds for tickets they had bought in advance. That meant they couldn't watch the movie there, but -- with it opening elsewhere around Thailand -- the group still planned to meet and see the film somewhere else. Some detained students sign agreement . A young activist, Bangkok University student Natchacha Kongudom, was taken to a police station and then to a military facility for flashing the Hunger Games salute at a Bangkok cinema, according to her friend Ratthapon. Natchacha was let go hours later, after signing an agreement promising not to take part in future political activities, human rights lawyer Anond Numpa said. Five Khon Kaen University students were asked to sign the same such agreement Thursday, a day after they were detained for eight hours after throwing up the three-fingered salute while wearing shirts bearing the words ""Don't want a military coup."" Video from CNN affiliate Channel 3 shows students being led away by authorities, a few feet from Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, after revealing their shirts and holding their fingers aloft. ""It is OK, just gently take them away, we will definitely take care of them,"" Prayuth said from a stage, where he was addressing civil servants. ""This just makes things more difficult if we don't understand each other."" The grinning Prime Minister then elicits laughs by saying, ""Anyone else want to protest?"" Two of the students ending up signing the agreement vowing not to partake in political activities, but the others refused. After intense talks, those three were let go without any conditions -- though by then they didn't want to go home out of fear of the military, according to Phavinee Chumsri, from the group Thai Lawyers for Human Rights. Invited to have an 'attitude adjustment' Sansern, the military government's spokesman, said Prayuth -- who was the army's chief before taking over as prime minister following the May coup -- told him what happened in Khon Kaen was ""very minor"" and that he thinks ""they are still very young."" ""When they grow up they will understand in what we are doing,"" Sansern said, summarizing Prayuth's sentiments. As to how the government is handling dissent, the major general insisted the ""military have been very lenient toward these activists."" ""We'll try to negotiate first, but if they still refuse to listen to us, we'd try to convince them through their parents,"" he said. ""And lastly, we would invite them to have attitude adjustment."" John Sifton, Human Rights Watch's Asia Advocacy Director, thinks it's Thailand's military government that needs an adjustment. ""Life in Thailand is growing more absurd by the day,"" he says, and ""all evidence suggests the so-called roadmap to democracy ... is really a roadmap to nowhere."" ""Someone needs to inform General Prayuth that if his system of government is threatened by young people emulating a Hollywood movie,"" Sifton adds, ""it is (a) pretty sure sign that things need to change.""

"(CNN) -- A Northwestern University psychology professor was in hot water Thursday for an after-class session in which a couple demonstrated the use of a sex toy. University President Morton Schapiro said he was ""troubled and disappointed"" by the February 21 incident and had ordered an investigation. ""Many members of the Northwestern community are disturbed by what took place on our campus,"" Schapiro said in a statement. ""So am I."" Professor J. Michael Bailey provided his own account of the optional event in his human sexuality course, saying he wants students to learn about sexual diversity and information from ""real people."" Students who witnessed the incident had been told repeatedly by a guest speaker what was about to happen would be graphic, the professor said in a statement. About 100 students chose to attend following a larger lecture, affiliate WGN said. Bailey invited speaker Ken Melvoin-Berg, co-owner of Weird Chicago Tours, who brought a woman and a man for a discussion on the female orgasm. Melvoin-Berg suggested they demonstrate use of high-powered equipment they brought, said the professor, who agreed to the idea. ""We gave them plenty of warning. We had nobody leave at that point,"" Melvoin-Berg told CNN Chicago affiliate WLS, adding the demonstration was meant to be educational. ""We only got positive feedback, 100% positive feedback during and after. The students were respectful. They were smart and asked good questions, intelligent questions and seemed engaged in the idea of human sexuality,"" said Melvoin-Berg. But apparently some students at the private school near Chicago left before or during the demonstration of what the professor described in a statement as ""kinky"" sex. ""For me, I'm glad I didn't see it. It was a little too explicit for me, and if I were in the class, if I would have stayed for the demonstration, I probably would have left. I know a couple of my friends did get up and leave,"" student Diana Lorenzini told CNN affiliate WLS. Brianne Williams, another student, said ""Dr. Michael Bailey is one of our finest professors here, and his class is about opening people's minds up."" Schapiro said he wants to determine what is appropriate for the classroom. ""Although the incident took place in an after-class session that students were not required to attend and students were advised in advance, several times, of the explicit nature of the activity, I feel it represented extremely poor judgment on the part of our faculty member,"" Schapiro said in his statement. ""I simply do not believe this was appropriate, necessary or in keeping with Northwestern University's academic mission."" In his statement, Bailey said it was too early to tell whether he had regrets. ""I certainly have no regrets concerning Northwestern students, who have demonstrated that they are open-minded grown-ups rather than fragile children,"" the professor added.","Northwestern University students see sex demonstration in after-class session .

"(CNN)Amira Abase told her father she was going to a wedding. Instead, the 15-year-old British girl hopped on a plane with two friends to Turkey -- and police fear they are headed to Syria to join ISIS. ""What she's doing is completely nonsense,"" said Amira's father, Abase Hussen. He implored Amira to come home. ""Remember how we love you. Your sister, brother, they cannot stop crying."" Six days ago, the trio of British girls ran away from home and flew from London to Istanbul. It's unclear where Amira, 15-year-old Shamima Begum and 16-year-old Kadiza Sultana are. But authorities worry their next stop will be Syria. Ibrahim Kalin, a representative for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said at a news conference that Turkey is helping search for the girls. ""About these three British citizens: British authorities and Turkish authorities, our security forces and our intelligence service are working together diligently to find them, to stop them or to figure out what is motivating them if they came here,"" he said. British authorities hope the trio will reach out to them. ""This is an ongoing, live counterterrorism operation, and we're concerned about these three girls,"" London Metropolitan Police Cmdr. Richard Walton said. ""There's a good possibility, a strong possibility, that we can stop them going into Syria. And our main objective here is to make contact with these three young girls, for them to make contact with us, preferably."" But so far, silence. The notion that three girls from London could succumb to the lure of ISIS highlights the terror group's aptitude for recruiting young foreigners. Why is ISIS so good at attracting Westerners? British Prime Minister David Cameron said the case illustrates the need to fight ISIS on multiple levels. ""It does make a broader point which is the fight against Islamist terror is not just one that we can wage by the police and border control,"" Cameron said Saturday. ""It needs every school, every university, every college, every community to recognize they have a role to play, we all have a role to play in stopping people from having their minds poisoned by this appalling death cult."" Shamima's family has also made a public plea in hopes the girls will return. ""Syria is a dangerous place and we don't want you to go there. Get in touch with the police and they will help to bring you home,"" the girl's family said in a statement released by police. ""You are not in any trouble."" The family said Shamima has strong desires to help those she believes are suffering in Syria. ""You can help from home. You don't have to put yourself in danger,"" her family said. ""Please don't cross the border. Please come home to us. Our Mum needs you home and is really worried. We are not mad at you, we love you."" British police say they are concerned about the number of young women and girls who are either hoping to or who already have joined ISIS. While they wouldn't divulge numbers, they say it's a growing trend. Shamima's sister, Renu Begum, described the 15-year-old as an ""A-star student."" But even bright, promising children can fall prey. ""To convince such young girls at that age that are so vulnerable ... it's just wrong,"" Begum said. ""It's a really evil thing to do. You're breaking up entire families."" Walton said there are ways of helping detect whether teens may be drawn to a terror group. ""If young people are showing interest in passports, trying to get hold of lots of money, there are signs. Anything breaking the normal routine, any evidence ... of children lying about where they may be,"" he said. British police say once they're in Syria with ISIS, it's unlikely they will ever be allowed to leave.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Actress Arlene Martel, who ""Star Trek"" fans know as Spock's bride-to-be, died in a Los Angeles hospital Tuesday of complications from a heart attack, her son said. Martel was 78. Martel's ethnic ambiguity earned her the nickname ""The Chameleon"" among Hollywood casting directors in the 1960s, son Jod Kaftan told CNN. It gained her diverse roles, including as a Russian spy on ""The Monkees"" and ""I Dream of Jeannie,"" a French Underground operative in ""Hogan's Heroes,"" a Native American woman in a ""Gunsmoke"" episode and as a Vulcan on ""Star Trek."" Trekkies still lined up at sci-fi conventions to meet Martel and pay for autographs because of her role as T'Pring, the Vulcan priestess engaged to Spock in the first episode of the iconic show's second season. Leonard Nimoy, who was the original Spock, tweeted his tribute to her: ""Saying goodbye to T'Pring, Arlene Martel. A lovely talent."" Martel is also known for two former boyfriends. She was one of James Dean's girlfriends in New York before he became a star, Kaftan said. She also dated actor Cary Grant for a time, he said. Her acting career began on Broadway when she was a teenager. She was cast as Esther in the 1956 production of ""Uncle Willie."" She was still using her birth name Arline Sax for her credits then. Her television career started in 1959 with a move to Hollywood. She soon landed guest roles on hit shows, including ""Twilight Zone,"" ""Death Valley Days,"" and ""Have Gun -- Will Travel."" Although the roles slowed down over the decades, Martel always considered herself a working actress. ""She was still getting out there, doing roles,"" Kaftan said. ""She had a lot of big dreams she was still pursuing."" Although battling cancer over the past five years, she still traveled around the world to conventions where ""Star Trek"" fans gathered. Her son said it was an odd experience for him to go with her because ""guys would have a crush on your mom because she's a sci-fi babe from the '60s."" People we've lost in 2014 .

"(CNN) -- As many as 10,000 albinos are in hiding in east Africa over fears that they will be dismembered and their body parts sold to witchdoctors, the Red Cross said in a recent report. The killings of albinos in Burundi and Tanzania, who are targeted because their body parts are believed to have special powers, have sparked fears among the population in the two countries, the report said. Body parts of albinos are sought in some regions of Africa because they are believed to bring wealth and good luck. Attackers chop off limbs and pluck out organs to sell to dealers, who in turn sell them to witchdoctors. Scores of albinos have fled to Tanzanian schools for the disabled or in emergency shelters set up by police in Burundi to avoid attacks, according to the report. ""Thousands more albinos across a huge swathe of countryside ... are unable to move freely to trade, study or cultivate fields for fear of albino hunters,"" the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said. Tanzanian government officials have said they are mobilizing police to help the embattled population, but admit it is hard to quell the attacks. Most happen in rural areas, where there is not enough police presence, according to Lucca Haule, assistant commissioner of police. ""We don't have the resources in those places ... it is not easy, but we are trying to map out locations where albinos live so that we can better protect them,"" he told CNN earlier this month. In early November, a court sentenced four people to death in northern Tanzania for killing an albino man and selling his body parts. So far, seven people have been sentenced to death for the killing of more than 50 Tanzanian albinos, including children, in the past two years, Haule said. Dozens more are awaiting trial. Albinism is a genetic condition that leads to little or no pigment in the eyes, skin and hair. African albinos are discriminated against and face segregation most of their lives. They also battle a high risk of skin cancer. The aid agency said it is helping albinos find indoor employment by teaching them skin care tips, including using protective hats and long-sleeved shirts. ""Even before the killings began two years ago, albino people in tropical Africa suffered an array of afflictions that made physical survival a desperate struggle,"" said Salif Keita, a Malian albino singer and human rights activist. The Red Cross societies in both countries said they need support to respond to the humanitarian crisis. Since 2007, at least 44 Tanzanian albinos have been killed and 14 in Burundi. Some organizations have put the number at more than 50 in Tanzania.","About 10,000 albinos in hiding in east Africa over fears they will be dismembered .

"Pope Francis is to make his first trip to the United States as the head of the Catholic Church in September, the Vatican said Monday. He will travel to the World Meeting of the Families, said Vatican spokesman the Rev. Federico Lombardi. The Catholic public event, which celebrates the family as the basic building block of society, is to be held in Philadelphia next year. ""It is the answer to the countless prayers of so many people who have asked God to guide Pope Francis to Philadelphia, the culmination of many months of hopeful anticipation, and the fulfillment of my own confidence that the Holy Father would grace us with his presence next year,"" Philadelphia Archbishop Charles Chaput said in a statement. At a news conference, Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter heralded the occasion as ""something truly to be excited about."" ""Pope Francis has demonstrated grace, vision and wisdom in these first few years of his papacy,"" the mayor said. ""He's been committed to building consensus, embracing diversity and celebrating faith. We must follow his example and work to encourage and engage with others in the same way."" The trip will make Francis the fourth reigning Pontiff to visit the United States, the World Meeting of the Families said. The challenges that families face in modern times have been a hallmark topic for Pope Francis. He is to hold a Mass on Philadelphia's broad central city avenue, Benjamin Franklin Parkway, on September 27. World of the Family Meetings were instituted by St. John Paul II and have taken place every three years, starting with the first one in Rome in 1994.","He will be the fourth Pope to visit the U.S., Catholic organization says .

"(CNN) -- Now this is about much more than Michael Brown and a grand jury's decision not to indict the officer who shot him. From Harvard to Texas A&M to Stanford, college students nationwide have walked out of classes or staged ""die-ins"" to decry police violence and racial profiling. They've been joined by demonstrators across the country who say they won't stop clamoring for change until they see real action. And more and more, the protesters reflect a wide array of races and backgrounds. ""We come from a privileged background, and it's easy for many of our friends to deny what's going on in this country,"" one white prep school student told CNN affiliate WABC as he protested Monday in Manhattan. ""But we feel it's our duty to speak up for what's right -- speak up for justice."" Outside Harvard Law School, a sea of students lay on the cold bricks to draw attention to Brown's death. Others did the same in St. Louis and in front of the Justice Department in Washington, mimicking the way Brown's body lay on a street for 4 1/2 hours. In cities across the country, one sign was so prolific that the words on it proved true: . ""Ferguson is everywhere."" Moving forward . So how does the country go from die-ins and walk-outs to actual change? After meeting with law enforcement officials and activists Monday, President Barack Obama outlined several new efforts. ""I'm going to be proposing some new community policing initiatives that will significantly expand funding and training for local law enforcement, including up to 50,000 additional body-worn cameras for law enforcement agencies,"" Obama said. The president addressed concerns about ""whether we are militarizing domestic law enforcement unnecessarily."" He ordered a review after the widely criticized heavy-handed police response to Ferguson protesters in August, and that review suggests largely leaving intact federal programs that provide surplus military equipment to local police departments. But Obama plans to issue an executive order to tighten some of the controls over the programs to better track equipment provided to law enforcement agencies. The president also announced a new task force, chaired by the Philadelphia police commissioner and a criminology professor, that will reach out to law enforcement, community activists and other stakeholders to come up with best practices on creating accountability and trust between communities and police. That task force must present their recommendations to Obama in 90 days. The president admitted than in the past, task forces have fallen short. But ""this time will be different, because the President of the United States is deeply vested in making it different,"" Obama said. ""In the two years I have remaining as President, I'm going to make sure that we follow through."" Holder heckled . In the first leg of his national dialogue, Attorney General Eric Holder met with community members at Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church -- where Martin Luther King Jr. preached. Holder's speech was interrupted by a group of protesters chanting, ""No justice, no peace"" and ""We have nothing to lose but our chains."" But the attorney general didn't criticize the hecklers. In fact, he praised them. ""There will be a tendency on the part of some to condemn what we just saw, but we should not,"" Holder said. ""What we saw there was a genuine expression of concern and involvement. And it is through that level of involvement, that level of concern and I hope a level of perseverance and commitment, that change ultimately will come. And so let me be clear, let me be clear, I ain't mad atcha, all right?"" Complete coverage of what's happening in Ferguson . CNN's Evan Perez and Catherine E.

"Lake Victoria, Africa's largest lake, has been plagued by water hyacinth plants for over two decades. While its flowers can be beautiful its foliage can grow to cover large swaths of the waters in a dense green mat of leaves that choke the shoreline of fish. Fishermen often struggle each day for a meager catch, but an entrepreneurial weaver has found that the invasive plant can be a free source of material for the area's women who make handicrafts. ""When we make products from this hyacinth, we are empowering women economically. They become self-reliant. That means we are alleviating poverty,"" said Caroline Agwanda, who heads Hyacinth Ornaments Production Enterprises in Kisumu, Kenya. The organization, which sells products ranging from handbags to furniture, aims to give employment to disadvantaged women, youths and those with disabilities. For years, the area's weavers have used banana and sisal fibers to make their wares. They are now turning to hyacinth because of its abundance. But if the weavers' craft is flourishing, many in the local fishing community are suffering. Water hyacinth grows into a thick bed of waxy leaves and violet flowers that cover the surface of the lake. It is native to South America but was introduced in Africa in the late 1800s. The plant species can double its mass every five days, according to scientists. Because of its dense growth, it blocks sunlight from reaching the lake's native aquatic plants, which affects fish and other marine life-- and those who make their livelihoods catching them. ""It has really affected us because the quantity of fish that we used to get from this lake has diminished,"" said Jonathan Opiyo, a fisherman. The difficulties faced by the fishing community are evident at the local markets, where instead of fish traders and buyers loudly haggling over prices, there are only a few quiet voices. The weavers are not even putting a dent into the sheer growth of the plant, which at the moment is particularly severe. ""It goes all the way -- the furthest you can actually see,"" said Philip Ochieng, a research scientist who is working with the government to mitigate the environmental problems caused by hyacinth. ""This is the biggest acreage of water hyacinth since it was first reported in Lake Victoria in 1992."" Methods that have been tried in the past include the release of South American weevils that eat the plant, as well as machinery that shreds from the water surface. These efforts worked for a while but were not seen as a permanent solution. Ochieng does not advocate the weavers' use of hyacinth, because transporting it from the lake to their homes could help the plant spread. However  Agwanda says she thinks the weavers could make a real contribution to the removal of the harmful plant from the lake. She would like to see support for the project and to have the resources for machinery that would help make thousands of meters of hyacinth rope each day. ""If we have like a factory somewhere, we'll be consuming a lot of hyacinth,"" Agwanda said. The wares that Agwanda's group creates are sold mainly in large towns across Kenya. The finished items are not cheap, and some she says some locals do not appreciate the innovation of utilizing a menacing weed. ""They say, 'You normally get this hyacinth free of charge from the lake. You should sell it for 20 shilling.' They're not looking at the time and skill of coming up with new products and a competitive product,"" she said.

"Sen. John McCain agrees that Ashton Carter is ""qualified"" for the Defense Secretary position, but warns that he won't have much say on pressing national security issues.

Meet Chuck Hagel's expected replacement as Defense Secretary . McCain, who will pick up the Armed Services Committee gavel in January, is likely to chair Carter's confirmation hearing, if he is nominated by President Barack Obama, which sources told CNN is expected to happen soon. While he thinks Carter will have a smooth hearing, he doesn't think he's the right person to lead the fight against ISIS. And it's not his fault. ""No one can [lead the fight] because the White House, according to his three predecessors, centers all of the decision making among a handful of people in the White House who have only one thing in common: that they don't know anything about the military,"" he said. The Arizona senator has continually attacked the president for being soft on combating ISIS. In a recent interview on Comedy Central's ""Colber Report,"" McCain said boots on the ground is an inevitable reality, but there's no way of knowing when it will happen because the president has remained passive on the issue. ""It's a reality, this administration doesn't give decision making authority to anybody but three or four people in the White House, which is one of the reasons it's been such an abysmal failure."" McCain says Carter will have to answer questions about the administration's ISIS strategy, ""but it won't impact his nomination.""

"The Supreme Court will undertake a major examination of privacy in the digital age, after accepting review Friday of a pair of appeals over whether police must obtain a warrant to search data on the cellphone of a person under arrest. Criminal suspects in Massachusetts and California were convicted, in part, after phone numbers, text messages, and addresses obtained from personal electronic devices linked them to criminal drug and gang activity. Oral arguments could be held as early as April, with a potential far-reaching ruling by June. The appeals are separate from President Barack Obama's review of National Security Agency surveillance of metadata phone records. The individual search cases give the justices a timely opportunity to reenter the public debate over the limits of privacy in the digital age, with focus on the ubiquitous cellphone and its vast storage of information and video. That has left judges nationwide divided recently over how to apply a 40-year-old high-court precedent, which allows searches of items a suspect possesses following arrest. Should law enforcement have such easy warrantless access to possibly incriminating, even embarrassing, digital evidence, or should exceptions be created? David Riley was arrested in 2009 for an expired registration on his vehicle. When authorities impounded the vehicle, loaded weapons were found hidden under the hood. After his arrest, San Diego police took a look at his smartphone. Text messages and contacts in the device led officers to believe Riley had organized crime connections, and video of another vehicle owned by the suspect was linked to an earlier drive-by shooting. He was convicted in state court and received a 15-year jail sentence. Separately, Brima Wurie was arrested in 2007 for selling two packets of crack cocaine. He had an old-style flip phone in his pocket, and police in Boston used call logs on the device to trace his real home address, after he gave a bogus one. There officers with a search warrant found more drugs, a weapon, and ammunition. He was later convicted in federal court. In neither case was a warrant sought by police before the phones were initially searched. But one appeals court upheld Riley's conviction, while another tossed out Wurie's. That split was likely the impetus for the Supreme Court to step in now and try to clarify search guidelines in these and future cases. The Constitution's Fourth Amendment protects against ""unreasonable searches and seizures."" But the high court has repeatedly affirmed the government's discretion to conduct warrantless initial patdowns and searches of persons and vehicles-- to ensure officers' safety and prevent destruction of evidence. But privacy advocates and defense attorneys argue portable, easily storable technology makes these appeals different. ""Modern cell phones provide ready access to a vast array of personal data, and are distinct from the types of possessions, such as cigarette packages and footlockers, this [high] court has previously considered,"" said Jeffery Fisher, a Stanford University law professor, and Riley's attorney. ""Thus, a search incident to arrest could, at the touch of a button, become a search of private and confidential information such as medical records, banking activity, and work-related e-mails,"" Fisher said. But California officials say for constitutional purposes, a cellphone is no different than a wallet when it comes to initial searches of criminal suspects. ""A custodial arrest of a suspect based on probable cause is a reasonable intrusion under the Fourth Amendment; that intrusion being lawful, a search incident to arrest requires no additional justification,"" said Kamala Harris, California attorney general. At least 85-percent of Americans own cellphones, according to recent surveys, many of the more sophisticated variety such as smartphones, that allow mass storage of personal information that can be easily shared. Not lost on the larger national debate over government searches was the fact the justices accepted these two petitions the same day Obama justified the electronic surveillance efforts by the National Security Agency. Obama announced changes to the way intelligence agencies will gather raw telephone records-- so-called meta data of numbers and times of phone calls by nearly every American. But he defended the need for continued intelligence-gathering efforts of domestic and foreign communications, to stop potential terror plots. The current cases are U-S v. Wurie (13-212) and Riley v. California (13-132).","Court accepts two appeals on search warrants and cell phones .

"Jean-Claude Van Damme's ""Kickboxer"" is being remade, and ""The Muscles from Brussels"" will be one of the stars. According to The Hollywood Reporter, 54-year-old Van Damme is in final negotiations to join the cast of the upcoming remake, which will be directed by ""Blue Crush"" and ""Into the Blue"" helmer John Stockwell. The original 1989 ""Kickboxer"" helped launch Van Damme's career as an action star. He starred in the cult favorite as Kurt Sloane, a young martial artist who travels to Thailand and trains in kickboxing to avenge his brother's vicious loss to a fighter named Tong Po. This time around, Van Damme will no longer be the student but the master. He's signing on to play an updated take on Master Xian Chow, the role played by Dennis Chan in the original. ""We are so excited to have 'Kickboxer' roll into production and to have (Van Damme) in the role of Master Chow ... to have him lead the franchise to a new generation,"" one of the remake's producers said in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter.

"(CNN) -- Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair's attempt to spread the festive cheer turned into a turkey after social media users mocked his new Christmas card. Blair issued his annual Christmas card on Monday. It features a photo of him, with a forced grimace on his face, standing next to his wife Cherie alongside the caption ""Season's Greetings."" The unnatural-looking smile quickly became the source of online derision, with Twitter users quick to compare the image to a range of gurning icons, from Count Orlock from ""Nosferatu"" and ""Friends'"" Chandler Bing. @carlmaxim noted that ""the strange thing about Tony Blair's Christmas card is how the teeth seem to follow you round the room."" Other users decided to do their own version of the card. Some took the opportunity for some -- admittedly outdated -- political satire. User @GeneralBoles superimposed Blair's successor Gordon Brown's face onto Blair's and tweeted ""Come on Tony, it's my turn,"" a reference to Brown waiting for Blair to step down as prime minister and repeatedly telling him, ""It's my turn now."" Others took the culture route, with @Rowland72James superimposing the couple's faces onto Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, while @garboy photoshopped their faces onto the notoriously unsmiling Grant Wood painting ""American Gothic."" When asked about the card, a spokesperson for Blair's office told CNN: ""We do not 'officially' release the card, cards are sent to their friends and colleagues, which doesn't seem to me to be that unusual a process let alone one which merits such interest.""","Tony Blair's Christmas card features the former British PM's unnatural grin .

"(CNN) -- Presidential kids are off-limits. That's the unwritten rule in Washington. But rules are broken -- and Elizabeth Lauten is hardly the first one to do so. Lauten, communications director for Tennessee Rep. Stephen Fincher, resigned from her post after setting off a social media firestorm by railing against the Obama daughters. In a Thanksgiving-Day screed on Facebook, she scolded Malia and Sasha Obama, 16 and 13 years old, respectively, for what she said was their inappropriate outfits and their bored looks during Wednesday's turkey pardoning ceremony. ""Try showing a little class,"" Lauten wrote. ""Dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar. And certainly don't make faces during televised, public events,"" she concluded. She later apologized, but the post went viral. CNN political analyst John Avlon said Lauten's reaction was ""way out of order. "" ""Let's reality check here, folks. This is a turkey pardon. This is not a matter of war and peace. This is kind of an odd bit of show dating back to Harry Truman,"" he said. ""And I think a bunch of teenagers could be pretty easily forgiven for not taking it too terribly seriously without insulting the republic."" GOP staffer resigns over criticism of Obama daughters . The White House expressed shock, but so did the GOP. ""Children, especially the first daughters, should be off-limits in the political discourse from attacks,"" said Sean Spicer, the Republican National Committee communications director. It has long been a bipartisan goal to respect, and protect, the privacy of presidential kids, who are living in a fishbowl through no fault of their own. But that hands-off policy has limits. Here are some examples from the recent past: . Amy Carter . Amy was just 9 years old when her father, Jimmy Carter, took up residence in the White House in 1977. Her first day of class at a public elementary school was a media circus, with photographers snapping shots just a few feet away of her in a stocking cap, jacket and Snoopy tote bag. The school quickly established some ground rules to ensure a semblance of normalcy. Even the Secret Service agents who accompanied her had to wait in an office across the hall. Chelsea Clinton . This first daughter turned 13 about a month after the inauguration of her father, Bill Clinton. Wanting her to have a normal childhood, the Clintons asked the media to limit their coverage of Chelsea to public events. ""We really work hard on making sure that Chelsea doesn't let other people define her sense of her own self-worth,"" President Bill Clinton said in a 1992 People magazine interview. ""It's tough when you are an adolescent because peer opinion and other people's opinion become more important. But I think she'll be OK."" Still, it wasn't long before ""Saturday Night Live"" and Rush Limbaugh took a crack at Chelsea, mocking her appearance. Limbaugh compared her to a dog. . He then recounted how he apologized once to Amy Carter for calling her ""the most unattractive presidential daughter in the history of the country."" Jenna and Barbara Bush . Jenna and Barbara, daughters of George W. Bush, were already young adults -- but not of legal drinking age -- when their names were splashed in headlines during the spring of 2001 after getting caught with liquor. Largely ignored by the media up to that point, the 19-year-olds were branded ""party girls"" by the tabloids. Five weeks later, Jenna was in trouble again for attempting to use a fake ID to buy alcohol. A ""New York Post"" headline screamed: ""Jenna and Tonic - Bush daughter in new booze incident as twin sister watched."" And all of this happened before the age of social media, in which the Obama daughters now live. When everyone has a voice via Facebook, Twitter and the like, the children of political families may be subjected to the same swings and arrows as their parents. It shows how ""divided and how dumb and mean-spirited so many of our debates are right now,"" Avlon said. ""It's an indication of how ugly and undercutting the politics are that even kids are fair game to some people who are punching way below their weight. It's ugly, ugly stuff."" Dana Bash, CNN's chief Congressional correspondent, reported from Washington; Ed Payne reported and wrote from Atlanta.","There's an unwritten rule that presidential kids are off-limits .

"Republicans hoping to secure yet another House victory in their already substantial majority won in the 2014 midterm election are on edge as GOP candidate Martha McSally's lead over incumbent Rep. Ron Barber has dwindled down to a mere 161 votes, a margin small enough to trigger an automatic recount. This will be the state's first-ever congressional recount. Emerging from election night, McSally led Barber by a mere 36 votes. But technical difficulties later triggered a recount for early votes in Cochise County -- a predominantly Republican area -- that gave McSally a slightly greater lead. Weeks later, Barber tried to cut McSally's lead by challenging a decision by election officials to reject 133 votes from two predominantly liberal counties. But on Thursday, a Tucson federal judge denied the request. Team Barber files suit in uncalled House race . The recount procedure in the Arizona is expected to take about two weeks with a final certification -- and presumably a final winner --  determined by Tuesday, December 16. Barber was elected to Congress in 2012 after his boss, former Rep. Gabby Giffords, was shot in the head and severely wounded outside an Arizona supermarket. McSally, a retired Air Force colonel, challenged Barber -- who also suffered two gunshot wounds in the parking lot attack -- for the seat. Barber won his first election with less than 1 percent of the vote in Arizona's second congressional district. The recount procedure in the Arizona is expected to take about two weeks with a final certification -- and presumably a final winner -- determined by Tuesday, December 16. The new House balance of power currently stands at 244 Republicans, 188 Democrats and three districts undecided: Gifford's seat and Louisiana's fifth and sixth congressional district. Republicans have a net gain of at least 10 seats and could have a net gain of up to 13 seats, depending on the outcome of this race, as well as two races in Louisiana.","The race for former Rep.

"(CNN) -- The Republican 2016 presidential field is starting to come into focus with potential contenders making notable moves this week. Here's a breakdown of the latest headlines starting to shape the early race for the Republican nomination. Portman is out . Pollsters can cross one name off their long list: Rob Portman. The Ohio Republican announced Tuesday he's running for re-election to his Senate seat. Portman was vetted, but ultimately not picked, to be Mitt Romney's running mate in 2012, and he would have been the first pro-same sex marriage Republican presidential candidate if he ran this cycle. He said as recently as two weeks ago that he was considering a presidential run, telling CNN's Erin McPike that he ""probably (has) more experience than other people who are running or thinking about running."" Instead the senator will seek a second term in the Senate, where he thinks he can ""play the most constructive role."" Bush is ""thinking"" Jeb Bush reiterated that he's still considering a presidential run, revealing more details Monday about his decision-making process. ""I'm thinking about running for president, and I'll make up my mind in short order,"" the former Florida governor said at an event hosted by the Wall Street Journal. He said he's determining whether his candidacy could ""lift people's spirits and not get sucked into the vortex,"" adding that he's also questioning if ""the sacrifice for my family is tolerable."" Son says Jeb Bush 'more than likely' eyeing 2016 run . With Bush considered a potential frontrunner, the rest of the GOP field is eagerly awaiting his decision. Those perhaps most interested include Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who was mentored by Bush, and other candidates who appeal to moderate Republicans, like Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey. ""I don't know if I'd be a good candidate or a bad one,"" Bush said. ""I kind of know how a Republican can win."" Ben Carson on the verge of becoming a political phenomenon . A renowned neurosurgeon who's become popular in conservative circles, Ben Carson is still climbing up the charts, according to a new CNN/ORC International Poll. Carson came in second place behind Mitt Romney in the survey, which measure support for potential 2016 contenders. Carson rose to political fame after publicly chiding the direction the country was going during his remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast in February 2013. President Barack Obama was sitting just a few feet away. Since then, he's been likened to a rockstar among conservatives, and he's become the only African-American Republican expressing interest in a 2016 presidential run. His abhorrence for political correctness has also made him a favorite among radio talk shows. ""I try to talk about what I actually see that's going on and this is what we need in America,"" he told CNN's Mark Preston for a profile piece. ""We need people who are not afraid to express themselves and who are not afraid to debate issues."" In the interview, Carson said that if the right candidate emerges before May 1, he won't run for the White House. Rand Paul is definitely running in 2016 ... for the Senate . While Sen. Rand Paul has been saying for more than a year that he plans on running for a second term in the Senate, the Kentucky Republican made it official Tuesday. But he has a bumpy road ahead. Kentucky election law allows candidates to appear on a ballot only once at a time, making it difficult for Paul if he also runs for president â€” a decision he told the Lexington Herald-Leader that he's about ""four to six months"" away from making. His allies in the state Senate tried to help him by passing a bill that tweaks the law, but the measure stalled in the Democratic-controlled state House. Still, Paul has other options, including a possible court challenge or convincing the state GOP to change its nominating system in 2016 from a primary to a caucus. That way, his name wouldn't appear on a ballot. Or, he could just not appear on the ballot at all and forego Kentucky's delegates. It's unclear which direction he'll take, but expect Democrats to seize on Paul's attempt to run for two offices. ""Where I come from, people think if you can't make up your mind on which office you want to run for, then you ain't fit to serve in either one,"" Kentucky House Speaker Greg Stumbo told CNN. Chris Christie wins high praise from Iowa's top Republican . In a bizarre 2016 storyline, Gov. Chris Christie vetoed a popular bill that would have banned gestation crates that severely limit the mobility of pigs in New Jersey. While his decision drew strong pushback from animal rights activists and other supporters, the veto kept Christie in high standing with Gov. Terry Branstad of Iowa. The Hawkeye State is the nation's top pork producer. Branstad, who holds significant influence in Iowa's first-in-the-nation presidential nominating contest, said Monday that Christie's veto was a ""good decision,"" adding that he personally lobbied Christie to reject the bill. Christie said he vetoed the bill because it was a ""solution in search of a problem"" and a ""political movement masquerading as substantive policy."" But his opponents say the decision was simply a political ploy with 2016 ambitions on his mind. Democratic state Sen. Ray Lesniak, a strong backer of the bill, pledged that the state legislature would attempt to override the veto, according to NJ.com. Mitt Romney's hair. Enough said. One can hardly write about 2016 without mentioning Romney and the latest earth-shattering news that his picture perfect hair is -- wait for it -- not always perfectly coiffed. The bombshell was revealed by his wife, Ann Romney, on Twitter during Thanksgiving weekend. Disheveled or not, he's still the most favored potential Republican contender, carrying 20% support among Republican voters in CNN's latest poll, with other names getting 10% or less. He may have said a thousand times in the past two years that he's not running again, but until someone else emerges as a frontrunner, voters are poised to keep him as their top choice. What Mitt Romney learned running for president: Debating is 'sweaty business' Oh, right. And Newt Gingrich said this. Talking about the emerging field, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who ran for president in 2012, didn't rule out the idea of another run. ""I haven't totally closed the door, but I'm certainly not opening it,"" he said Tuesday on CNN's ""Wolf."" He later added that it's actually ""very implausible"" and that he ""doubts very much"" he'll ""end up in that game."" ""But that tells you how early it is,"" he said. CNN's Jeremy Diamond, Dana Bash, Eric Bradner, and Mark Preston contributed to this report.","Rob Portman announced he won't run for president in 2016 .

"Qatar has lifted a travel ban against a U.S. couple who were cleared in that Mideast nation in the death of their adopted daughter, meaning they are free to return home, the U.S. ambassador to Qatar said Tuesday. An appeals judge in Qatar on Sunday cleared Matthew and Grace Huang of starving their adopted daughter to death in 2013 in a case that drew global attention to that country's justice system. The Huangs were blocked from leaving Qatar on Sunday at Hamad International Airport by immigration officials who confiscated their passports, according to the Doha News agency, citing family spokesman Eric Volz. Diplomatic sources said Monday the departure was delayed due only to legal procedures that take place once people have been cleared of a crime. On Tuesday, U.S. Ambassador to Qatar Dana Smith said a travel ban against the couple was lifted following a motion that was filed Monday, and after talks between Smith and top Qatari officials. The Huangs, who were living in Qatar while Matthew Huang worked for an international company that was constructing sites  for the 2022 World Cup, were arrested in January 2013 when their 8-year-old daughter Gloria died. They were charged with starving her to death, convicted in March and sentenced to three years in prison. The Qatari prosecutor sought to paint Grace and Matthew Huang as inhumane -- alleging they bought their adopted daughter cheaply from her poverty-stricken parents in Africa -- and had threatened to seek human trafficking charges. The couple spent nearly a year in prison before being freed in November 2013 to await proceedings surrounding an appeal that they filed. Appellate Judge Abdulrahman al-Sharafi overturned the conviction on Sunday, citing weaknesses in forensic reports and saying the trial judge failed to properly consider testimony from witnesses who said Gloria wasn't deprived. A report by pathologists hired by the defense, obtained by CNN, stated they found no evidence that tissue samples were taken from Gloria's body after her death, despite the fact Qatari investigators submitted an autopsy report. Advocates for the Huangs suggested the lab report was fabricated and said their request with the Qatari judiciary for a formal investigation went unanswered. After the couple's arrest, their two sons, also adopted from Africa, were temporarily placed in a Qatari orphanage. They have since been sent back to the United States to live with Grace Huang's mother.","A U.S. couple was cleared of the death of their adopted child .

"(CNN) -- He rose from humble beginnings, worked his way through the local leagues before graduating to become a major player on the international stage, netting him millions of dollars along the way. But this isn't a tale about a footballing hero. This is a story about one of modern sport's greatest villains -- the man dubbed the most notorious match-fixer in the world. You may not be familiar with the name Wilson Raj Perumal but given how prolific he was, you might have watched one of the games he's fixed. ""I never really counted, but I think it should be between 80-100 football matches,"" Perumal told CNN's Don Riddell in his first-ever television interview. Few doors seemed to be closed to Perumal. ""I was on the bench at times, and telling players what to do, giving orders to the coach. It was that easy. There was no policing whatsoever."" Officials were just as easy to target, he boasts, with ""no barriers"" when approaching select referees, while certain football associations would ""welcome you with open arms,"" he added. It was only after his arrest and subsequent conviction in 2011 -- his fourth for football-related crimes - - that Perumal started coming clean on his former life, with the poacher-turned-gamekeeper now helping European police combat match-fixing. In all, Perumal claims to have pocketed around $5 million himself from match-fixing. However, he lost it all gambling, perhaps explaining why the 49-year-old recently published an autobiography, ""Kelong Kings,"" recounting his journey from rural Singapore to football's globetrotting Mr Fix-it. ""I had my boyhood dreams. I wanted to be a soldier but during my school days I got a criminal record and couldn't really pursue what I wanted to. And then I got attracted to betting when I was about 19-20 years old,"" he said. ""I kind of got hooked and I didn't want to lose ... so I started fixing local matches,"" he says. Perumal plied his trade in Singapore's local football leagues in the late 1980s before joining what international crime-fighting organization INTERPOL recently described as ""the world's most notorious match-fixing syndicate"" allegedly headed by Tan Seet Eng -- better known as ""Dan Tan,"" who is now reportedly in detention in Singapore. As the Internet age dawned in the mid-1990s, so Perumal's match-fixing horizons expanded. ""We could see all these matches around the world ... I had the opportunity to target vulnerable countries ... people who were prone to accept bribes,"" he said. ""So I registered a company and started e-mailing associations and building relationships."" 'Like two hands prepared to clap' The 49-year-old's first foray into international match-fixing -- a 1997 friendly match between Zimbabwe and Bosnia Herzegovina -- failed, he says. Perumal alleges up to six players from the Zimbabwe team had agreed to lose the match 4-0 in return for a share of $100,000. But the game played in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia finished in a 2-2 draw. ""We gave them a result that was difficult to accomplish and what happened during the game was that one player accidentally kicked the ball into the net."" A decade later, Perumal targeted Zimbabwe again in what became known as the ""Asiagate"" scandal with both players and officials receiving bribes to fix a string of matches between 2007 and 2009. ""We were like two hands prepared to clap,"" Perumal says. Former FIFA match-fixing investigator, Terry Steans was shocked when he was handed a FIFA case file on match-fixing in Zimbabwe in 2009. ""I read that file and thought: 'No. It can't be. It can't be this easy and it can't be this prevalent,'"" Steans told CNN. ""Five years later, I know yes it was and yes it is. But that file opened our eyes and it was to set FIFA Security, at that time, on a path to try and discover as much as we could about the fixers and how prevalent and widespread they were."" Zimbabwe's game was destroyed by the fixing scandal, Steans says. Dozens of players and officials were sanctioned, some receiving life bans while others were barred from playing for several years. The Footballers Union of Zimbabwe has been critical of the Zimbabwe Football Association (ZIFA) investigation but Steans says ZIFA deserves credit for taking action. ""They appointed an investigation committee and they took the investigation as far as they possibly could do."" CNN invited ZIFA to comment on match-fixing in the country but they hadn't responded by the time of publication. Hat trick of jail terms . Perumal says he achieved around a 70-80% success rate and claims to have rigged games at the Olympics, World Cup qualifiers, the women's World Cup, the CONCACAF Gold Cup and the African Cup of Nations. But his attempts to corrupt didn't always go undetected by the authorities, notably in Singapore where he was imprisoned three times for football-related offences. In 1995, he was jailed for 12 months for trying to bribe a football player. Four years later he was imprisoned for 26 months for introducing a referee to a match-fixer and in 2000 he attacked a footballer with a hockey stick prior to a game -- an offense he says he deeply regrets. In 2011, the football authorities eventually caught up with Perumal again, this time in Finland where he was arrested and subsequently jailed for fixing matches in the Veikkausliiga, the country's premier football division. Perumal served one year of a two-year sentence before being extradited to Hungary where he has been helping police there with match-fixing investigations in the Balkans. Steans was shocked when police showed him Perumal's list of contacts. ""Perumal had 38 countries in one phone book contacts list -- he had officials and players from those 38 countries,"" Steans told CNN. ""If you then go to his laptop address book, there were over 50. FIFA has 209 associations ... so we are talking a quarter of FIFA associations for one fixer,"" he added. ""As we now know, he used most of these people and used them for his own ends and his syndicate's ends and made a lot of money out of it."" He might have lost all his ill-gotten gains but Perumal looks back fondly on that period of his life. ""I have no regrets. It was like, it was a phase of my life and I enjoyed it and I traveled around the world. I had a good time."" There are glimmers of remorse. Perumal says he feels sorry for fixing some matches but then says there are ""no regrets"" for others. ""Football is no longer a sport. It is more like a business now. So I think we're just trying to make money out of this business. People want to win and they will do anything just to get a result."" Pitch battle . FIFA says preserving the game's integrity is ""a top priority"" and in 2011 announced it was giving INTERPOL â‚¬20 million ($26.5 million) to fight match-fixing. ""We take any allegations of match manipulation very seriously and are looking into those,"" FIFA's media department told CNN via email. ""Obviously we are aware of publications such as 'Kelong Kings.' We do not further comment on our activities and we do not share investigative reports. ""FIFA continues to work closely with law enforcement agencies as well as the respective public authorities and other sports organizations on a national regional and global level to tackle the issue of match manipulation."" But Perumal thinks they could be doing more. ""FIFA has not come up with enough strategies or methods or publicity or marketing or whatever you can call it, to combat match-fixing,"" Perumal says. ""FIFA are doing a lot of things to combat racism but I think match-fixing is more of a problem than racism. I'm not saying FIFA shouldn't pump in so much money (to tackle racism) but what I'm saying is that match-fixing is a more pressing issue."" Steans says Perumal has been ""value for money"" for investigators helping them understand how match-fixers operate. ""Wilson is a bit of an enigma,"" he says. ""But you know what, every piece of information that he gave out of Finland and Hungary that came our way was right."" The former FIFA man is still fighting match fixing, working as a consultant for a sports corruption company. But given the recent past, he fears for football's future if match fixing continues to carry on virtually unchecked. ""We end up with a game that lacks integrity, with the game's reputation in tatters and with fans not really knowing what they're watching,"" Steans says. ""Will fans watch? We'd probably end up with something similar to Zimbabwe where fans walked away, sponsors walked away ... You will end up with a game that means nothing. Just means nothing. ""And when it means nothing, sponsors don't want it and fans don't want it either. So teams would be playing in empty stadiums. It'd be a desert.""

"An Indian man slapped a movie star in the face during the filming of a TV show in Mumbai because of the length of her dress, police said. The man, Mohammad Akil Malik, is accused of assaulting Gauhar Khan, an actress and TV host, in a break in shooting for a music-themed reality show on Sunday evening, said V.S. Chavan, a local police official. Malik also tried to ""manhandle"" Khan while asking her why she was wearing a short dress, Chavan said Tuesday. He demanded to know ""how she could wear skimpy outfits and dance to cheap songs despite being a Muslim,"" the Times of India reported, citing an unidentified police official. Private security guards from the TV show overpowered Malik at the scene and handed him over to police.

"Francesco Schettino, captain of the wrecked Costa Concordia cruise ship, took the stand for the first time Tuesday, combative and contradicting the testimony of not just his first captain but also what he has said in the past about the deadly shipwreck. Schettino -- who is charged with manslaughter, causing a maritime disaster and abandoning ship with passengers still on board -- denies wrongdoing. He faces up to 23 years in prison if convicted. He remained defiant even while painting a picture of confusion on board the ship as the disaster unfolded, pointing the finger at others for the chaotic evacuation of the ship's passengers. Five of the captain's co-workers have already entered guilty pleas in the case, including officers who were on the ship. These pleas may work against Schettino as he answers questions with regard to the co-workers' testimony before the court in Grosseto. When shown the deposition given by his first captain, Ciro Ambrosio, who pleaded guilty to manslaughter in exchange for a lighter sentence, Schettino was argumentative and gesticulated wildly. What Ambrosio told the court in his testimony is similar to the version of events Schettino has given in past TV interviews, but the captain contradicted that version in his testimony Tuesday. Schettino's attorneys argued that what the captain has previously said on Italian TV cannot be used as evidence in court. The disputed testimony deals with such details as radar readings, who was on the bridge at the time of the accident and where those people were positioned. Speaking to CNN during a court break, Schettino said he was confident about how his trial was progressing. ""It is exhausting, but I think it is going well,"" Schettino said of Tuesday's hearing. ""It is important because this is the only chance I have to tell my version of events."" Asked if he thought the court was sympathetic to him, he said, ""This is the first time I have had a chance to officially address the court personally so this should be the first time they should be judging me. I am confident."" His testimony is expected to continue Wednesday and probably one day next week. The cruise liner capsized after it struck rocks off Italy's Giglio Island in the Tyrrhenian Sea on January 12, 2012. No one died on impact, but 32 lives were lost during the subsequent chaotic evacuation of some 4,200 people on board the ship. Chaos on the bridge . Schettino was sworn in under a giant sign reading, ""The law is equal for everyone,"" in a makeshift courtroom in Grosetto's red velvet Teatro Moderno. As assistant prosecutor Alessandro Leopizzi questioned Schettino, the captain described a scene of utter chaos on the bridge both before and after the accident. At one point he explained how it was common to invite passengers and guests on the bridge, and said they often tipped him. ""I said there couldn't be more than 12 people at a time,"" he said. ""And they would bring 20, 30, 70 euro a tour."" He acknowledged frequently conducting flyby activities -- deviating from the planned route to go closer to certain places -- with his cruise ship. ""It was favorable from a commercial aspect,"" he said. When the prosecutor asked if he had ever done a flyby past Giglio before, he said he couldn't remember but might have passed close by. 'Not trying to blame anyone' Schettino also explained why he chose Giglio on this occasion, telling the court that he thought retired Costa Capt. Mario Palombo was on the island. When the prosecutor asked Schettino why he called Palombo and then why he asked Palombo how deep the coastal waters were, he said he was just making conversation. Schettino recounted how he gave the orders to the helmsman, Jacob Rusli Bin of Indonesia, to go off course after using his binoculars to look ahead. When asked if his helmsman caused the accident, he said: ""I'm not trying to blame anyone. I'm just trying to explain the circumstances."" The captain has suggested Rusli Bin did not speak English or Italian well enough to understand his orders -- although audiotape played in court Tuesday appeared to contradict that. Pushed as to why he used his binoculars instead of relying on the radar, Schettino said, ""It was my habit to take my binoculars and look first. Not that I didn't trust the radar, but it was how I did it."" He was confident that the ship had enough room for the maneuver, he said. In an audiotape played over the radar from the bridge extracted from the ship's data recorder, Schettino told his helmsman to turn, ""otherwise we go on the rocks."" Asked why he made that comment, he said he was being ironic. ""A few minutes later, I was told the danger we were in."" Alarm bells . Schettino appeared visibly shaken, putting his head in his hands, shortly after radar and audio recordings of the moment of impact were played in court. Bells and alarms rang, and then the recording went offline. The prosecutor asked Schettino about his last words captured on tape. ""But where did we touch?"" the captain asked, to which someone said, ""Oh my dear God."" Schettino also will be cross-examined by a number of civil parties at the court. They include the attorney for a Moldovan dancer who dined with the captain and was with him on the command bridge at the time of the shipwreck. 'Ready to defend his honor' Before the hearing began, Schettino's attorney, Domenico Pepe, told CNN his client was ready to tell the truth. ""We have waited a long time to set the record straight,"" he said. ""He is ready to defend his honor."" Schettino has repeatedly presented a defiant face over the shipwreck. He has pointed the finger at the Costa cruise company for not providing maps with the rocks he hit appropriately marked. Schettino has also blamed the ship, saying generators did not work so the elevators did not function, which hindered some people's escape.","Francesco Schettino paints scene of chaos on the bridge at the time of the wreck .

"Washington (CNN) -- A senior administrator with the Federal Air Marshal Service has been removed from his leadership position while the agency investigates a ""culturally insensitive"" remark he made on a recent conference call, CNN confirmed Tuesday. John A. Novak, assistant director of the service, dismissed a black colleague's suggestion that the agency hold regional meetings to improve communications by saying such meetings are ""nothing but traveling minstrel shows with people with banjos and guitars,"" said a senior government official familiar with the investigation. The reference to minstrel shows, in which white performers in blackface lampooned African Americans, was offensive, the senior official said. ""It was dumb. It was stupid. It was egregious,"" added the official, who spoke on condition of not being identified by name. The official was not authorized to speak about the case publicly. The controversy comes at a time when the new director of the air marshal service, Robert Bray, is trying to distance the agency from accusations that it is rife with racism, sexism and favoritism. In recent years, numerous federal air marshals -- plainclothes officers who protect planes from terrorists -- have complained of unequal treatment. Most famously, agents in the Orlando office complained that supervisors there used a ""Jeopardy Board"" game with terms that were offensive toward homosexuals and others. Officials with the federal Transportation Security Administration, which includes the air marshal service, confirmed Tuesday that Novak had been reassigned from his post as head of field operations, pending an investigation. ""TSA holds its employees to the highest professional standards,"" TSA spokesman Nicholas Kimball said. ""TSA and the Office of Law Enforcement/Federal Air Marshal Services takes any allegation of misconduct seriously and inappropriate actions will not be tolerated."" The circumstances surrounding Novak's comments, which he made during a conference call two weeks ago, are being investigated by TSA's Office of Inspection, sources within the agency said. On Monday, Novak apologized in person to two special agents in charge who had been offended by the remark, said Fida Majzoub, another spokesperson for the air marshals service. Reached by CNN on Tuesday, Novak declined to comment, citing the ongoing investigation. Novak, a former Secret Service Agent, has served with the Federal Air Marshal Service since 2002. Several officials who claimed lengthy work experience with Novak said he has no history of making racist or racially tinged comments. Novak recently helped coordinate a series of meetings with regional offices on how to handle Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaints, one official said. Told of the incident by CNN, Jon Adler, the head of an association that represents rank-and-file air marshals, called the incident ""unacceptable."" ""We all need to respect and abide by the zero tolerance policy in the government. In an instance where it's coming from an executive, it's sub-zero tolerance,"" said Adler, national president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association. ""It's incumbent upon them as leaders to set an example, not violate it,"" Adler said. An internal e-mail obtained by CNN said Novak will become ""acting executive advisor"" at the TSA effective November 21, pending a review by an internal board. CNN Homeland Security Correspondent Jeanne Meserve contributed to this report.","An investigation of the incident is under way .

"A  Togolese opposition leader is calling on women to go on a weeklong sex strike to demand the freedom of protesters detained ahead of  elections in the West African nation. Police arrested about 120 opposition supporters last week during clashes between protesters and security forces, according to Togolese human rights groups. Government officials said all but eight had been released, and those still detained were in possession of knives. ""You don't go demonstrate with these,"" security minister Damehane Yark said of the weapons. Demonstrators have taken to the streets in the capital of Lome for weeks to protest new electoral reforms they say favor the ruling party ahead of October's parliamentary elections. They are seeking a repeal of changes to the electoral laws. Protests continued Saturday, with a female opposition leader calling for sex strikes starting Monday. ""I am inviting all women to observe a one-week sex strike, fasting and prayers to set our arrested brothers and husbands free,"" said Isabelle Ameganvi, leader of the opposition Let's Save Togo. ""So all you ladies have to keep the gate of your 'motherland' locked up to all men from Monday up to Sunday."" The opposition leader said she is inspired by Liberian Nobel laureate and current President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who in 2003 called on women in her nation to observe a sex strike to press for peace amid a raging war. Sex strikes have become a common way of civil disobedience in recent years. In 2009, Kenyan women pressed for a sex strike to end bickering among coalition government officials. Last year, a group of women in a violence-plagued area of the Philippines slapped men with a sex ban until they promised to quit fighting. Their stand helped end clashes in July between villages in rural Mindanao Island. ""We have power to change things. We do not want to remain in the kitchen, but we can have our say in politics,"" Ameganvi said. ""We  cannot stay hand-crossed, as our children and husbands are being kept in jail."" In addition to the sex strike, she called on women to wear a special color during a demonstration Thursday. ""You all have to be dressed up in red pants to show your anger,"" she said, amid cheers. The actions will be among a series of civil disobedience events planned. ""If our people are not released by Thursday, the women are going to rush to the prison naked to get them released, only in red pants and nothing else,""  she said. The security minister said any attempts to enter the prison will lead to arrests. ""We await them,"" Yark  said."" In a state of rule of law like ours, we will get them arrested for offending moral values."" Togolese officials invited the opposition  for talks Friday, but it turned down the government invitation. ""We will not hold any discussions with the government except those aimed at negotiating President Faure Gnassingbe's departure from power,"" said constitutional law professor Zeus Ajavon, an opposition supporter. Togo has been led by the same family for more than 40 years . Gnassingbe Eyadema ruled for 38 years until his death seven years ago. His son has led the nation since then.

"New York (CNN) -- An airport security supervisor accused of stealing from passengers and accepting stolen money was granted $100,000 bail Wednesday by a U.S. magistrate judge in federal court in Newark, New Jersey. Michael Arato, 41, is seen on surveillance video at Newark Liberty International Airport, according to a federal criminal complaint. The video has not been released. Arato, of Ewing, New Jersey, is charged with one count of accepting bribes, one count of conspiring to commit theft and three counts of theft by a government employee. He was brought into court handcuffed and with shackles on his feet. Arato was the supervisory transportation security officer for the Transportation Security Administration at Terminal B of the airport, and worked with a colleague to steal from passengers, according to the complaint.  He and the colleague -- who has been cooperating with authorities -- frequently worked together at ""the B-3 checkpoint."" The checkpoint is typically the security checkpoint for international airlines including AirIndia, the complaint said. Beginning in August 2009, TSA and the Port Authority Police Department of New York and New Jersey ""received numerous complaints from passengers scheduled to depart the airport on the 6:20 p.m. AirIndia flight that money and other valuables in passengers' carry-on baggage were missing after their baggage was hand searched by TSA employees at the B-3 checkpoint,"" the complaint said. The complaining passengers were predominantly non-English-speaking women of Indian descent and nationality who were returning to India after visiting the United States, according to the complaint. Authorities launched an investigation, including video surveillance of the checkpoint. Arato told authorities Tuesday that ""he had considered harming himself,"" assistant U.S. attorney Eric Kanefsy told Magistrate Judge Michael A. Shipp. Arato's public defender, John Yauch, said his client would not harm himself and was not a flight risk. ""He has too much to live for."" Arato's colleague, identified in the complaint as the ""co-schemer,"" began cooperating with authorities in September 2010 and told police he has been stealing from passengers at the checkpoint since about October 2009. The colleague said that he and Arato had agreed that when he stole from passengers, he would ""kick up"" half the money to Arato. Arato also regularly stole from passengers himself, sometimes giving his colleague some of that money, according to the complaint. Between September 13 and October 5, Arato accepted a total of $3,100 from the colleague, the complaint said. In an audiotaped conversation, Arato told the colleague he did not feel bad stealing from foreigners, as they were ""leaving this country with our money,"" according to the complaint. The colleague told police he would steal, on average, $400 to $700 a day from passengers and gave Arato $200 to $400, the complaint said. Meanwhile, he said Arato usually stole $400 to $700 a day, sharing some of it at times. On August 31, Arato stole $400 from a female passenger of Indian descent by conducting a search of her bag, according to the complaint. The woman noticed the money missing after passing through the checkpoint, and approached a senior special agent with the Office of the Inspector General to report it, the documents said. The agent left the woman to investigate, but saw Arato approach the woman, along with a police officer. Arato told the woman someone else had found the money on the floor and gave it to him, and returned it. However, the complaint said, an AirIndia representative had told Arato's colleague that the woman had reported the theft and that a police officer was taking a report from her. ""The co-schemer knew that he had not committed that particular theft and therefore believed Arato must have done it, so the co-schemer immediately called Arato on his cell phone to alert him,"" the complaint said. Both Arato and the colleague are shown stealing money from passengers on video surveillance, according to the complaint, and video surveillance showed Arato accepting $100 bills on numerous occasions from the colleague. Surveillance from September 29 shows the colleague pulling about $1,000 from an envelope and giving Arato $500, ""which Arato accepted while laughing and then put into his front shirt pocket,"" the complaint said. ""Arato then gave the middle finger to a visible security camera in the [transportation security officers'] office."" In audio recordings made October 5, the colleague told Arato that he took a ""full envelope"" from a passenger and put it in the security office next to the checkpoint, according to the complaint. ""Arato instructed the co-schemer to go to the airport gate where the passenger was scheduled to depart to make sure that the passenger departed the airport without noticing that their money was missing,"" the complaint said. ""After the co-schemer told Arato that the passenger had departed, Arato accepted $900 from the co-schemer."" Authorities executed a search warrant to search Arato that same day, and found $1,300 in his pants pocket. ""The serial numbers on $1,100 of the money recovered from Arato matched the serial numbers on the money that was provided to the co-schemer by law enforcement to give to Arato earlier that day,"" the complaint said. An additional $100 matched the serial number of a bill police gave the colleague the day earlier, and Arato told authorities he had used another $100 to buy groceries, according to the documents. Between 2003, and Wednesday, 162 TSA employees were terminated or removed from duty for theft from passengers or luggage at checkpoints, according to the agency. The TSA said that number is a small fraction of those who were employed during that time. ""TSA holds its security officers to the highest professional and ethical standards and has a zero-tolerance policy for theft in the workplace,"" said TSA spokesman Nicholas Kimball. ""We investigate any allegation of misconduct. When infractions are discovered, we move quickly to terminate the employment of offenders. It's sad that the reprehensible conduct of a few individuals threatens to tarnish the 50,000 honest, hard-working folks from all walks of life whose patriotism ensures the security of millions of people every single day.""

"Disgraced, imprisoned and facing money laundering charges in the United States, former Guatemalan President Alfonso Portillo is reigniting his defense. The leader of Guatemala from 2000 to 2004, Portillo has always denied the charges against him and now says the accusations are based on the lies of political enemies seeking revenge. ""It is revenge that was organized and a result of a conspiracy among certain sectors, as much those in economic power in Guatemala as my enemies and ideological adversaries in the United States, to get revenge against me and remove me from the political scene,"" Portillo said in an exclusive interview with CNN en Español broadcast Thursday morning. Chain-link fences and barbed wire surrounded him as he spoke to the network from the courtyard of a Guatemalan prison this week. In addition to airing his grievances with the media, Portillo said earlier this month that he will file a complaint before the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, alleging that his rights have been violated by authorities. He alleges he was denied due process in his first extradition from Mexico to Guatemala in 2008 and by a second extradition request by the United States. Portillo said right-wing political adversaries in the United States engineered the charges against him. ""In the United States it is a revenge of the richest group of the American right. They are charging me for being the only president who did not support with his signature nor with his permission the invasion in Iraq,"" Portillo said. ""So, I know that it is not only illegal. I know that it is eminently political, my detention in Guatemala."" But U.S. prosecutors have said it was Portillo who abused the political system, accusing him of using his authority to launder and misappropriate millions of dollars intended for his country's people. ""Portillo is charged with converting the office of the Guatemalan presidency into his personal ATM,"" Preet Bharara, U.S. attorney for the southern district of New York, said in a 2010 statement. ""Through various alleged embezzlement schemes, including one which involved $1.5 million intended for Guatemalan school children, Portillo abused the trust of his nation's people."" An indictment unsealed in New York federal court accuses Portillo of embezzling tens of millions of dollars worth of public funds, ""a substantial portion of which he laundered through American and European bank accounts."" After the United States made an extradition request, Guatemalan authorities arrested him on a farm on the country's coast in 2010. Guatemalan courts and the country's president authorized his extradition to the United States in 2011, but the transfer has yet to take place. A U.S. State Department spokeswoman declined to comment on the status of the extradition case. Portillo told CNN en Español that he never laundered money in U.S. banks. ""If deposits were made,"" he said, ""they are deposits that first of all come from institutions that are not illicit. In order for there to be laundering, the first requirement is that the money is from an illegal origin or comes from an illegal activity."" Guatemalan courts have previously acquitted Portillo of embezzlement allegations -- something that Portillo says shows that the U.S. accusations against him are baseless. Portillo responded directly to the charge concerning the $1.5 million that the United States says was intended for school children. That money, Portillo said, was something he had requested and received before he became president. From the beginning, that money was raised to create a trust fund to support his daughter's studies, and that is what it was used for, Portillo said. Despite his claims that his rights have been violated during the extradition process, Portillo said he believes he will get a fair trial in the United States. ""I have confidence that at least I will have a transparent, impartial, objective trial that is based on reliable evidence and not just testimonies that are based on falsehoods,"" he said. A fair trial would not be possible in Guatemala, he added. In the meantime, prison life hasn't been too bad, the former president said. ""I think pain and suffering make men better, make women better, make human beings better,"" he said. In the three years he has spent in prison, he has read more than 100 books and seen more movies, he said. ""I don't regret anything. And I know this has some purpose. It will accomplish something in my life,"" Portillo said. ""Let God decide my destiny, and let history condemn or absolve me.""","Former Guatemalan President Alfonso Portillo is facing extradition to the United States .

"(CNN) -- Ray Rice, the embattled Baltimore Ravens running back, told Matt Lauer in an interview on the ""Today"" show that ""the only thing I can hope for and wish for is a second chance."" Rice was captured on film delivering a knock-out punch to his fiancee, now wife, in an Atlantic City hotel elevator. I don't think he should get that second chance he is asking for. Domestic violence is an outright attack against women -- individually and as a gender. While I know from 30 years of experience as a criminal defense attorney that domestic violence is not limited to female victims, the overwhelming percentage of domestic violence events are men using their physical strength to overpower women. It is an insidious assault upon our mothers, sisters, girlfriends and wives. As a society, we tolerate far too much of this type of abuse. We cannot tolerate it any longer, especially from celebrated public figures. They may not all deserve it, but celebrities are idolized in this country. From Hollywood actors to sports heroes and recording artists, we have created an extraordinarily special class amongst us. Great benefit and great advantage comes with such celebrity, and whether they like it or not, great responsibility comes as well. Sometimes, celebrities fail to live up to their responsibilities. Rather than forgiving the dalliances and sins of those whom we have made demigods, we owe it to our children (the ones who are looking up to these demigods) to hold their heroes' feet to the fire and send a clear message. If we are going to pay somebody tens of millions of dollars to make movies, play sports or perform on stage, then we should also let them know that the privilege we have granted can be easily revoked if they fail to act responsibly. NFL brass admits 'crucial mistake' in punishment of Rice . Rice made himself a celebrity when he accepted a $35 million dollar contract with an NFL football team. When he punched his fiancee in the face and dragged her unconscious body out of a hotel elevator, he violated a public trust, and he shouldn't be allowed to play football for the NFL anymore. Admittedly, this zero tolerance policy argument flies in the face of the mitigation that I always argue on behalf of my criminal clients, but most criminal clients are not role models to millions of fans. Just like Donald Sterling, who was stripped of his ownership of the LA Clippers for making racist remarks, Rice should learn that if you're going to bear the fruit, then you must also bear the burden. When we tell domestic abusers such as Ray Rice, in such a public way, that it's OK to knock out your wife and drag her out of an elevator, then we are telling everyone it's OK. We're telling the young boys and teenagers who wear Rice jerseys that hitting women is OK. Well, it's not OK.","Mark O'Mara: Ray Rice wants a second chance after video showed him punching fiancee .

"A U.S. couple cleared in Qatar of the death of their child have been told they are free to return home, but roadblocks remain. An appeals judge in Qatar on Sunday cleared them of starving their adopted daughter to death in 2013 in a case that drew global attention to the Middle Eastern nation's justice system. Diplomatic sources told CNN that Matthew and Grace Huang are expected to return to the United States soon. But the couple has been unable to leave. The Huangs were blocked from leaving Qatar on Sunday at Hamad International Airport by immigration officials, who confiscated their passports, according to the Doha News agency, which cited a family spokesman Eric Volz. A new warrant had been issued for their arrest on unknown charges, the agency cited Volz as saying. But diplomatic sources said Monday the departure was delayed due only to legal procedures once people have been cleared of a crime. Neither U.S. nor Qatari sources anticipate problems, the sources said. But Matthew Huang told CNN's Brooke Baldwin Monday that each day that passes without their exit from Qatar is the continuation of an injustice. ""We're tired, we're exhausted, and we want this to end,"" Huang said. He said he was unsure about the reports of a new warrant. As far as the couple knows, they have been acquitted and have been told they are free to leave, he said. ""However, we are still stuck in Qatar, and we have not been permitted to leave,"" Huang said. For the moment, he said, the State Department is unable to secure their release. ""We just want to resume our lives in the U.S. with our family and the Qatari government is just not allowing us to do so."" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Secretary of State John Kerry called Qatar's foreign minister to encourage the Qataris to let the Huangs leave. ""As we understand it, there is some paperwork that needs to be filed. That is something that would of course be in the hands of the lawyers,"" Psaki said.","A U.S. couple has been cleared of the death of their child .

"Who has the data investigators used to shape their search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, and why hasn't it been released to the public? The answer to those questions depends on who you ask. Facing a growing chorus of criticism from scientists and family members who want to see more details about why searchers are combing the southern Indian Ocean for the missing Boeing 777, Malaysia's top transportation official Thursday claimed his country doesn't have the raw data from the satellite's communication with the plane as it flew thousands of miles off course. The data is crucial because it's what led investigators to the area where they're currently searching for the plane. And in recent days, some scientists outside the investigation have suggested they don't trust investigators' analysis of the data, and questioned whether searchers are even looking in the right place. ""The raw data is with (satellite company) Inmarsat, not with Malaysia, not with Australia, not with Malaysia Airlines, so if there is any request for this raw data to be made available to the public, it must be made to Inmarsat,"" Acting Minister of Transportation Hishammuddin Hussein said. Australian officials heading the search in the Southern Indian Ocean tell CNN they don't have the raw data, either. But Inmarsat, which owns the satellites, insists that the data has already been released to investigators. ""Inmarsat's raw data was provided to the investigation team at an early stage in the search for MH370,"" Chris McLaughlin, the company's vice president of external relations, told CNN's ""Erin Burnett: OutFront."" He added, ""We have very high confidence in the analysis of this data, which was independently evaluated by the international teams accredited to the official investigation."" It's up to investigators, he said, to decide what they want to release -- and when. The company says the Convention on International Civil Aviation prevents the release findings from an investigation without the consent from the state conducting the investigation. ""I don't know who to believe,"" CNN aviation analyst Miles O'Brien said. ""But isn't it awful that it's quite evident somebody is lying here? Somebody is lying. We're talking about something that involves a missing airliner, now 70 days. Lives lost, families shattered. And there (are) people lying about this. This is absolutely reprehensible. I can't even believe...it would be funny if it wasn't so tragic."" Aviation attorney Arthur Rosenberg said he thinks the satellite company is obligated to release the data, whether or not Malaysian authorities have it. ""Unfortunately, you almost get the sense that they're stalling, that there's something in there that they don't want the world to see. And that's the problem,"" O'Brien said. ""That's why there's so little credibility right now about why this search zone has been identified."" Search officials turn to private companies for help . With no tangible evidence of Flight 370 after more than two months of searching, officials are reaching out to commercial companies for help. More specialized devices will be needed in this new stage of the search, which will focus on reanalyzing data to help ensure the correct search area; conducting a detailed mapping of the sea bed; and deploying specialized autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The Malaysian government is in the process of acquiring tools from companies such as Petronas, Sapura Kencana, Boustead and DEFTECH, acting Transportation Minister Hishammuddin said Thursday. Other nations may have other assets that would complement the search. Devices such as AUVs and deep-water towed side-scan sonars ""are very expensive and scarce,"" Hishammuddin said. Australia has estimated the new phase will cost $60 million. The breakdown of exactly who's going to pay for what is not clear. For most of the two-month search, each of the 26 countries involved has paid for their own costs. But three countries have been holding high-level discussions on how to proceed -- Malaysia, where the plane is from; China, which had more than 100 passengers on board; and Australia, which had six passengers on board and is close to where the official search area is focused. ""Procurement arrangements for the use of commercial contractors will be undertaken by Australia, in consultation with Malaysia,"" Hishammuddin said. Better communications . The Malaysian government has established a new committee to streamline communications between nations, families and others to release timely and transparent information, Hishammuddin said. Relatives of those on board have lambasted Malaysian officials for weeks, saying they have not been forthcoming and transparent in releasing data about the plane, which disappeared on March 8 with 239 people on board. Underwater search interrupted . The announcements Thursday came after the underwater search for Flight 370 came to an abrupt stop. Two technical problems -- a malfunctioning part on the Bluefin-21 underwater drone and a broken transponder on the drone's mother ship -- have forced the suspension of the underwater search for a least a few days, a U.S. Navy official said Wednesday. The drone and the transponder were damaged this week when the vehicle was being hoisted onto the deck of the Australian vessel Ocean Shield. The vehicle struck the navigation transponder, which extends over the side of the ship, said Michael Dean, the Navy's deputy director of ocean engineering. The Bluefin-21 currently is the only submersible looking for the Boeing 777, which was traveling from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing when it disappeared. Repairs were made to the submersible. But in subsequent tests, operators said the acoustic communications link on the Bluefin-21 and the navigation transponder on the Ocean Shield malfunctioned. No spare parts for either device were on the ship, Dean said. Parts necessary for the repairs are being shipped from the United Kingdom to Australia, he added.

"(CNN) -- Most Iranians support nuclear inspections, a democratic government and normal relations with the United States, a poll by a U.S.-based organization has found. A majority said President Ahmadinejad has not kept his promise to ""put oil money on the table of the people."" Terror Free Tomorrow found 80 percent of Iranians support full inspections and a guarantee not to develop nuclear weapons in return for aid from other countries. Slightly more than half, however, said they still favor the development of nuclear weapons and think the country would be safer with them. Developing the weapons is considered a ""very important"" priority for just 29 percent of those polled. But when presented with an option to give up nuclear weapons development in return for outside aid, only 17 percent still supported nuclear weapons development. The economy is more important to Iranians than developing nuclear weapons. Eighty-eight percent said they want economic improvement to be the government's top priority. The poll also found 56 percent think President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has failed to keep his campaign promise to ""put oil money on the table of the people themselves."" Additionally, 61 percent of those interviewed ""were willing to tell our pollsters over the phone that they oppose the current Iranian system of government, where the Supreme Leader rules according to religious principles and cannot be chosen or replaced by direct vote of the people."" Instead, 79 percent support a democratic system in which leaders are elected through free, direct elections. And while nearly two-thirds support financial assistance for opposition groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah, 55 percent of Iranians support recognizing Israel and Palestine as  independent states in exchange for normal relations with the United States. Terror Free Tomorrow, which has prominent Democrats and Republicans on its advisory board, conducted interviews in Farsi with 1,000 Iranians by telephone last month. The sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points. ""Face-to-face interviewing in Iran can be difficult for interviewers who risk possible prosecution and imprisonment. The last poll to ask similar controversial questions was conducted in September 2002 by Abbas Abdi inside Iran, who was imprisoned as a result,"" Terror Free Tomorrow said in its report on the poll. The group said its interviews, about evenly split between men and women, were ""proportionally distributed according to the population covering all 30 provinces of Iran."" The group's advisory board includes Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, and the co-chairs of the 9-11 commission, Lee Hamilton, a Democrat, and Tom Kean, a Republican.

"New details provide a clearer chronology about what might have happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 between its takeoff and its last known spotting seven hours later. Here's how experts and officials have reconstructed key moments of the flight, which disappeared March 8 with 239 people aboard. 12:41 a.m.: Takeoff . All tracking systems are working as the Boeing 777-200ER takes off from the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur, headed for Beijing. 1:07 a.m.: ACARS sends communication . One of the plane's communication systems sends what turns out to be its last transmission, according to Malaysia Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya. ""It showed nothing unusual. The 1:07 a.m. transmission showed a normal routing all the way to Beijing,"" according to a statement from Malaysia's Ministry of Transport. The Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System is the onboard computer that collects information -- a lot of it -- about aircraft and pilot performance. It's akin to computers in automobiles that track oil levels and engine performance. Aboard aircraft, ACARS computers measure thousands of data points and send the information via satellite to the airline, the engine manufacturer and other authorized parties, according to CNN aviation and airline correspondent Richard Quest. See maps of possible debris field, search areas . The information is useful for operations, maintenance, scheduling and performance purposes, Quest said. 1:19 a.m.: Voice check-in . Someone in the cockpit makes a voice check-in with air traffic controllers as the plane is apparently leaving Malaysian airspace and entering Vietnamese airspace. Initial investigations indicate it was the co-pilot, Fariq Abdul Hamid, according to Malaysia Airlines officials. ""All right, good night"" were the final words from the cockpit, said Zulazri Mohd Ahnuar, a Malaysian civil aviation officer. The phrase ""good night"" is the radio parlance used by pilots when executing a handover from one airspace to another, Quest said. ""That is normal. That happens a gazillion times,"" Quest said. "" 'All right, good night' is a pleasantry at the end of radio communication."" It remains unclear, however, whether Vietnamese air traffic controllers had any contact with the plane during the handoff, Quest said. 1:21 a.m.: Transponder off . The plane's transponder stops communicating at 1:21 a.m., said Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, director of the Malaysian Department of Civil Aviation. A transponder sends electronic messages from the plane: ""squawks"" to radar systems about the flight number, altitude, speed and heading. This is enormously useful information to air traffic controllers who are looking at scores of blips on their screens, and each blip is a plane emitting identifying information, thanks to the transponder. With the transponder off, ""now the plane is flying blind from the ground's point of view,"" Quest said. ""If there is radar there, the radar will see a blip, but they won't know who it is, where they are going. They will just now know it's there."" That's because the transponder isn't sending identifying information about the plane. Shutting off the transponder is a simple turn of a switch in the cockpit, Quest said. ""The air traffic controller should notice. I suppose it would cause alarm. ... (The information from) a plane that you're monitoring all of a sudden disappears,"" Quest said. 1:22 a.m.: Plane disappears from Thai military radar . Thai military radar is tracking the plane's signal, but it disappears at 1:22 a.m., a Royal Thai Air Force spokesman told CNN. 1:28 a.m.: Thai radar picks up unknown aircraft . The Thai radar station in southern Surathani province picks up an unknown aircraft flying in a direction opposite to what Flight 370 had been traveling, a Royal Thai Air Force spokesman told CNN. 1:21 a.m.-1:28 a.m.: Plane appears to change course . The plane appears to have changed course in this time frame.  The Malaysian government has not said when or if the plane was reprogrammed to fly off course. Again, according to the Malaysians, the last data from the ACARS at 1:07 a.m. indicated that it ""showed normal routing all the way to Beijing."" About 1:30 a.m.: Civilian radar loses contact with plane . Malaysian air traffic controllers in Subang, outside Kuala Lumpur, lose contact with the plane over the Gulf of Thailand between Malaysia and Vietnam at coordinates 06 55 15 N and 103 34 43 E. 1:37 a.m.: Expected ACARS transmission doesn't happen . The ACARS was supposed to transmit a half-hour after it last did so. Therefore, it was supposed to transmit at 1:37 a.m. -- but it didn't, Yahya said, . So, the ACARS stopped communicating sometime between 1:07 and 1:37 a.m. It's a significant event: Turning off ACARS takes know-how, Quest said. If the flight were hijacked or a target of terrorism, cutting off ACARS would be a strategic move because the system reports to satellites anything being done to the aircraft, Quest said. 2:15 a.m.: Military radar detection . Though the Malaysian plane is not transmitting information -- by ACARS or transponder -- radar on the ground or elsewhere can still detect a plane in the air. According to a Malaysian Air Force official, military radar tracked the plane as it passed over the small island of Pulau Perak in the Strait of Malacca. At this point, the plane was hundreds of miles off course. In fact, it was on the other side of the Malay Peninsula. Military radar showed that it flew in a westerly direction back over the Malay Peninsula, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Raza said. It is then believed to have either turned northwest toward the Bay of Bengal or southwest elsewhere into the Indian Ocean. This was the last time any civilian or military radar is known to have tracked the aircraft. The focus now is searching for the missing flight in the southern Indian Ocean, according to a U.S. official. ""The southern scenario seems more plausible,"" the official said. The Malaysian military is handing over its raw radar data to U.S. and British officials, apparently setting aside concerns about any sensitive military intelligence. Quest called this sharing of information a ""huge"" development in the case. ""They don't want anyone to know how good their radar is. They obviously decided that doesn't matter,"" he said. ""We don't know much about the Malaysian military and that has been one of the issues,"" Quest added. ""It appears that Malaysia was providing an interpretation of the analysis -- and not the raw data. Now they are handing over the raw data."" 2:40 a.m.: Malaysia Airlines says it learns plane missing from radar . Malaysian air traffic controllers told Malaysia Airlines at 2:40 a.m. that Flight 370 was missing from radar, according to the airline. 2:40-3:45 a.m.: Malaysia Airlines preliminary search . During this time, the airline ""sourced every communication possible to (Flight 370) to locate its whereabouts before declaring that it had lost contact with the aircraft,"" the company told CNN. ""During this period of uncertainty, Malaysia Airlines needed to establish facts by contacting other air traffic controllers and aircraft flying within the same route,"" the company said. 3:45 a.m.: Malaysia Airlines issues alert . Malaysia Airlines said it issued a ""code red"" alert that the plane was missing from radar.  The airline said ""code red"" is when it declares that a crisis requires immediate deployment of emergency response plans. It said it took about an hour to issue the alert because it was trying to locate the plane and confirm that it was missing. To verify, it used various measures, including sending messages to the plane and awaiting a response. 6:30 a.m.: Plane should have arrived in Beijing . This was the time that Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 should have landed in China's capital. 7:24 a.m.: Public announcement of disappearance . Malaysia Airlines announces the plane's disappearance on Facebook. 8:11 a.m.: Satellite 'handshakes' Najib revealed that a satellite tracked the plane at 8:11 a.m., more than seven hours after takeoff. Najib didn't provide details on the satellite tracking, but it appears that orbiters high above the ocean detected the plane as the satellite or satellites attempted a series of ""handshakes"" -- or electronic connections -- with the plane below, Quest said. It's likely that the plane didn't complete the handshake because its communication systems were disabled, Quest said. Nevertheless, the satellites would have been able to trace a plane flying below them and would have extended an electronic message equivalent to a hailing: ""There's a plane: Hello, hello, hello? Do you have anything for us?"" Quest said. The Malaysian Prime Minister said the ""raw satellite data"" confirms the plane was Flight 370. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration, along with Britain's Air Accidents Investigation Branch, concur, Najib said. ""Due to the type of satellite data, we are unable to confirm the precise location of the plane when it last made contact with the satellite,"" Najib said. Authorities believe the plane was in one of two flight ""corridors"": A northern route stretching to northern Thailand, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan in Central Asia or a southern route toward Indonesia and the southern Indian Ocean. Growing number of airplanes scour southern Indian Ocean .","The Malaysian government has not said when or if plane was reprogrammed .

"A bipartisan group of senators is again pushing for a vote this year on a measure that would change the way the military handles serious crimes like rape. The group, led by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-New York), renewed a push to pass the Military Justice Improvement Act that would create an independent military justice system to deal with serious crimes, taking the decision about whether to prosecute a case out of the hands of commanders -- so-called ""convening authorities"" -- and placing it in the hands of trained military prosecutors. The bill garnered 55 votes in the Senate in March, 5 short of the 60 needed to move forward. The senators said Tuesday there was still time to pass the legislation and they are urging their leadership to allow amendments to the annual National Defense Authorization Act when the Senate takes it up or to allow an up or down vote on the measure.

""Enough is enough,"" Cruz said. ""The time to solve this crisis is now."" Christensen, who argued it was ""vital"" to align the military justice process with American civilian justice, also said that President Barack Obama could make some changes to the courts martial process unilaterally through executive order with some limitations.

"As a growing number of airplanes scoured the southern Indian Ocean in the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, authorities released new details that paint a different picture of what may have happened in the plane's cockpit. Military radar tracking shows that the aircraft changed altitude after making a sharp turn over the South China Sea as it headed toward the Strait of Malacca, a source close to the investigation into the missing flight told CNN. The plane flew as low as 12,000 feet at some point before it disappeared from radar, according to the source. The sharp turn seemed to be intentional, the source said, because executing it would have taken the Boeing 777 two minutes -- a time period during which the pilot or co-pilot could have sent an emergency signal if there had been a fire or other emergency onboard. Authorities say the plane didn't send any emergency signals, though some analysts say it's still unclear whether the pilots tried but weren't able to communicate because of a catastrophic failure. The official, who is not authorized to speak to the media, told CNN that the area the plane flew in after the turn is a heavily trafficked air corridor and that flying at 12,000 feet would have kept the jet well out of the way of that traffic. Earlier Sunday, Malaysian authorities said the last transmission from the missing aircraft's reporting system showed it heading to Beijing -- a revelation that appears to undercut the theory that someone reprogrammed the plane's flight path before the co-pilot signed off with air-traffic controllers for the last time. That reduces, but doesn't rule out, suspicions about foul play in the cockpit. The new details give more insight about what happened on the plane, but don't explain why the plane went missing or where it could be. Analysts are divided about what the latest information could mean. Some argue it's a sign that mechanical failure sent the plane suddenly off course. Others say there are still too many unknowns to eliminate any possibilities. CNN aviation analyst Miles O'Brien called the fresh details about the flight a ""game changer."" ""Now we have no evidence the crew did anything wrong,"" he said. ""And in fact, now, we should be operating with the primary assumption being that something bad happened to that plane shortly after they said good night."" If a crisis on board caused the plane to lose pressure, he said, pilots could have chosen to deliberately fly lower to save passengers onboard. ""You want to get down to 10,000 feet, because that is when you don't have to worry about pressurization. You have enough air in the atmosphere naturally to keep everybody alive,"" he said. ""So part of the procedure for a rapid decompression ... it's called a high dive, and you go as quickly as you can down that to that altitude."" Military radar tracked the flight between 1:19 a.m. and 2:40 a.m. the day it went missing, the source told CNN, but it's not clear how long it took the plane to descend to 12,000 feet. The new details about altitude are ""highly significant,"" said Mary Schiavo, a CNN aviation analyst and former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation. ""It explains so many pieces that didn't fit together before,"" she said. ""Now, if we have a scenario where something happened, the plane made a dramatic turn and dropped from 35,000 feet to 12,000 feet, this scenario would fit what a pilot would do in the event of a catastrophic onboard event, such as a rapid decompression, a fire, an explosion. That's what you would have to do, descend, get down and turn around and try to get back to an airport that could accommodate an ailing plane."" If the latest information is accurate, the theory of pilots trying to save the plane fits, said Mark Weiss, a former American Airlines pilot and CNN aviation analyst. But that's a big if, he said. ""We've had so much information come out and so much contradictory information come out, that I caution against jumping to any types of conclusions at this point,"" he said. Challenging search . As speculation over what led to the flight's disappearance showed no signs of slowing, investigators appeared to be beefing up their efforts to comb the southern Indian Ocean. Buoyed by a third set of satellite data that indicated possible debris from the plane in the water, the international team led by Australia fought bad weather as it looked for signs of the Boeing 777 and the 239 people who were aboard when the plane went missing on March 8. The search for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane resumed Monday morning, with additional aircraft joining the operation, Australian authorities said. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority said 10 aircraft will search for possible objects in an area about 2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles) southwest of Perth. That includes two jets from China and two from Japan, which were on the way to join the search area on Monday, authorities said. France's Foreign Ministry said Sunday that radar data from a satellite pointed to floating debris in the Indian Ocean 2,300 kilometers (1,430 miles) from Perth, Australia. The data were immediately passed along to Malaysian authorities, and French satellite resources will home in more on the area, the ministry said. Satellite images previously issued by Australian and Chinese authorities have also captured possible large floating objects, stoking hopes searchers may find debris from the missing plane. But so far, searchers have turned up empty-handed after more than two weeks of scouring land and sea. On Saturday, searchers found a wooden pallet as well as strapping belts, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's John Young said. The use of wooden pallets is common in the airline industry. ""It's a possible lead ... but pallets are used in the shipping industry as well,"" he said Sunday. Authorities have said random debris is often found in the ocean. The flying distance to and from the search area presents a big challenge for search aircraft. ""They're operating at the limits of their endurance,"" said Mike Barton, the authority's rescue coordination chief. If search crews do turn up anything, they'll soon have more technology to help them. The U.S. Navy is sending a super-sensitive hydrophone listening device to Australia to be on standby if debris from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is found and a search for the plane's voice and data recorders can be done, a U.S. military official said Sunday. The device is pulled behind a ship at slow speeds and is used by the Navy to locate downed aircraft to a depth of 20,000 feet. Nothing but water, and questions . Was turn reprogrammed? Malaysian officials, in a written update Sunday on the search, cast doubt on the theory that someone, perhaps a pilot, had reprogrammed the aircraft to make an unexpected left turn during the flight. ""The last ACARS transmission, sent at 1:07 a.m., showed nothing unusual. The 1:07 a.m. transmission showed a normal routing all the way to Beijing,"" it read. The Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System measures thousands of data points and sends the information via satellite to the airline, the engine manufacturer and other authorized parties, according to CNN aviation and airline correspondent Richard Quest. Had the plane been reprogrammed to change course, the ACARS system should have reported it during its last communication at 1:07. The ACARS is supposed to report new information every 30 minutes, but it was silent at 1:37. ""It is important because it is more consistent (with an emergency). In other words, if the pilots had put in this waypoint that they were going to turn to and that they knew in advance of their last communication that they were going to turn, then everyone was (saying) that this had to be a premeditated act,"" Schiavo said. ""Now if this information is correct, and it was not premeditated, then it does fit very closely with the scenario that, whatever happened, happened suddenly and they turned perhaps to go back to an emergency airport."" Hope, only hope . Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott voiced hope that investigators could be closing in on an answer to questions that have dogged authorities for days: What happened to the plane, and where is it? ""We have now had a number of very credible leads, and there is increasing hope -- no more than hope, no more than hope -- that we might be on the road to discovering what did happen to this ill-fated aircraft,"" Abbott said at a news conference. In one of the great aviation mysteries in history, the airliner carrying 239 people disappeared March 8 after it took off from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on a flight to Beijing. An exhaustive search covering 2.97 million square miles -- nearly the size of the continental United States -- has yielded some clues but no evidence of where the Boeing 777 is or what happened to it. Countries from central Asia to Australia are also engaged in the search along an arc drawn by authorities based on satellite pings received from the plane hours after it vanished. One arc tracks the southern Indian Ocean zone that's the focus of current attention. The other arc tracks over parts of Cambodia, Laos, China and into Kazakhstan.

She says she wanted them to know they were not alone. Since then, at least 16 others have gone public with accusations. Many of them offered similar stories about being drugged and raped, and said they were reluctant to talk earlier because they feared for their careers, their families or their own safety. Three of Cosby's accusers, including Bowman, told CNN on Tuesday of having struggled and gained strength in solidarity. ""One of my main goals was to reach out to these women who didn't have the courage yet,"" said Bowman. ""Seeing it in action is really intense."" While Cosby has not commented on the allegations, his camp has repeatedly and vigorously denied them. In a recent statement, Cosby's lawyer Martin D. Singer said it defies common sense that ""so many people would have said nothing, done nothing, and made no reports to law enforcement or asserted civil claims if they thought they had been assaulted over a span of so many years."" Victoria Valentino was a Playboy bunny when, she claims, Cosby drugged and raped her in the late 1960s. She called such denials ""absolutely ridiculous,"" adding, ""he's got a very good spin doctor."" Asked why it took her and others so long to come forward, Valentino said that ""over the years, women didn't have a voice."" ""Rape victims, sexual assault victims were victimized by the system,"" she told CNN's 'New Day.'""... We didn't believe in the system, because the system did not stand by us through things like this."" Rape allegations won't go away for Bill Cosby . Comedian draws attention to Cosby accusations . In the pantheon of America's greatest comedians, they don't get much bigger than Bill Cosby. He broke though in the 1960s on the stand-up circuit with his reflections on everything growing up in Philadelphia to family life with his children and wife Camille. Cosby. His comedy albums became bestsellers and award-winners; he spearheaded numerous shows, from children's programming like ""Fat Albert"" and Nick Jr.'s current ""Little Bill"" to his groundbreaking sitcom, ""The Cosby Show."" Cosby also became a well-known and respected voice on a host of hot-button issues. ""Bill Cosby is a gifted comedian who has used the power of laughter to heal wounds and to build bridges,"" then-President George W. Bush said in awarding Cosby a Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2002. ""...  By focusing on our common humanity, Bill Cosby is helping to create a truly united America."" Yet Cosby's reputation has come crashing down in a few short weeks. Cosby resigns from Temple University board . It began in late October, when comedian Hannibal Buress bluntly attacked what he perceived as Cosby's ""smuggest old black man public persona"" and called him a ""rapist."" Bowman said Tuesday that it ""felt like a slap in the face"" that it took a comedian's comments on stage ""for people to perk up their ears and think, 'Oh, maybe there is something to this,' when it's such a serious situation."" By that point, years had passed since Temple University staffer Andrea Constand had sued Cosby alleging she had been drugged and sexually violated in 2004 and that 13 other ""Janes Does"" had similar stories. Bowman wrote in the Washington Post that she was one of those women, but she never got the chance to testify because the lawsuit was settled. Had she gotten the chance, Bowman would have recalled her life as an aspiring model and actress in her late teens back in the mid-1980s, back when Cosby starred in his eponymous No. 1 TV show as a doting, wisecracking dad. That was when, she claims, Cosby drugged and raped her, then told her, ""'I had better never, ever see your face or hear you name again.'"" After Buress' remarks she decided to put herself out there. ""It was really, really scary. I really felt like I was out in the wilderness, all by myself,"" Bowman told CNN. ""And one of the things that I kept saying over and over again was, 'If I could help one woman, just one, then I've done my job ... But I had no idea how powerful it was really going to be for these women and other women who are still off the record."" 'I thought I was the only one' Valentino said she had thought of coming forward before herself, but stopped because ""I couldn't relive it, I couldn't do it."" But ""it was a whole different ballgame"" after Bowman took that first step, Valentino said. In the age of the Internet, she said, accusations couldn't easily ""be swept away into the shadows any more."" Also on the CNN set Tuesday was Jewel Allison. ""For years, I thought that I was the only one,"" said Allison, who claims Cosby sexually assaulted her in the late 1980s, when she was a model and aspiring actress. ""I kept this as a secret ... afraid no one is going to believe you, afraid society is going to victimize you."" Allison said that, because she's African-American, she was especially reluctant to speak out, as Cosby has long been revered in that community. About a decade ago, Allison said, a friend alleged to her that Cosby had done something similar to her, but Allison urged her ""to keep quiet."" ""And I feel guilty, I feel horrible,"" Allison said. ""You're raised to, 'Shhh, don't talk.'"" Now is different, though. Meeting face-to-face with Bowman and Valentino is part of her ""healing process,"" she said. ""It wasn't about him, it was about what was best for me,"" added Allison. ""...When you tell the truth, it really does set you free. I never understood what that meant until now.""","Three of the at least 17 women who have accused Bill Cosby speak to CNN .

"Just days before the Florida State Seminoles play for the ACC football championship, star quarterback Jameis Winston is appearing before a panel that can decide whether he will continue as a student at the university. It's been almost two years since the Heisman Trophy winner was accused of sexually assaulting a then-FSU student. Winston was not arrested in connection with the alleged December 2012 incident, but he still could be charged by his university with a code-of-conduct violation for sexual misconduct, depending on the results of the school's investigation. He could face a wide range of sanctions if he is found in violation -- from a reprimand or counseling to probation, suspension or expulsion. ""This is the day that Mr. Winston has been desperately trying to avoid for two years,"" John Clune, one of the attorneys representing the woman who accused Winston, told CNN on Tuesday. ""This courageous young woman finally gets the chance to stand up for herself and against Mr. Winston and big-time college sports, which has long run over the rights and protection of women on campus. FSU breaks silence on Jameis Winston case . ""Neither Jameis Winston nor his lawyer can stop what is coming."" Winston categorically denied the allegations in a statement. ""I did not rape or sexually assault [the accuser]. I did not create a hostile, intimidating or offensive environment in the short period of time that we were together. [The accuser] had the capacity to consent to having sex with me and she repeatedly did so by her conduct and her verbal expressions."" He goes on to say, ""Rape is a vicious crime. The only thing as vicious as rape is falsely accusing someone of rape."" It seems improbable that a decision will be known before Saturday, when Florida State -- which has won 28 games in a row -- plays Georgia Tech with the ACC championship and a bid to the four-team College Football Playoff on the line. According to the university, a formal decision letter will be sent within 10 class days from the conclusion of the hearing. Florida State's investigation was launched under Title IX, which requires schools to investigate allegations of sexual assault, even if criminal charges are never filed. The hearing has been delayed twice. Tim Jansen, who was Winston's attorney in the criminal investigation, has said Winston had consensual sex with the woman. According to police documents, the accuser said Winston raped her after she had been drinking with friends at a bar in Tallahassee. She said an unknown man gave her a shot glass of liquid before they left the bar. The accuser said she did not remember little of what happened afterward, but that she did remember being in a ground-floor apartment where a man took off her clothes and had sex with her despite her objections. The accuser reported the alleged assault to campus police that night. A month later, in January 2013, she said the man who allegedly assaulted her was Winston. FSU said in October that Winston informed the athletics department of the allegation after he was contacted by a Tallahassee police detective. The university said the athletics department did not initially file a report with the school's Title IX administrator because no charges were filed and because other players who were with Winston said there was no sexual assault. A Title IX investigation was opened after media inquiries, and after law enforcement had referred the case to the state attorney's office. Tallahassee interim Police Chief Tom Coe said last year that the woman ""broke off contact"" with investigators in February 2013 and didn't want to go forward with the case. The woman's family says a detective warned her attorney that Tallahassee is a ""big football town"" and that life could be miserable if she pursued the case. In December 2013, the Florida state attorney for the judicial circuit that includes Leon County and Tallahassee, announced that investigators did not have probable cause to arrest Winston. Later that month, Winston won the Heisman, and in January 2014 the Seminoles defeated Auburn to win the BCS national title. Winston spent the spring playing for the Florida State baseball team, but off the field he continued to make headlines for the wrong reasons. In April, Winston was accused of shoplifting crab legs from a Publix grocery in Tallahassee. Police said that Winston said he forgot to pay. As part of a civil citation for alleged shoplifting -- an alternative to criminal prosecution for first-time, nonviolent offenses in Leon County -- Winston was not arrested but was ordered to serve at least 20 hours of community service, authorities said. In September, Winston was suspended for the Seminoles' game against Clemson for yelling a sexually explicit remark near the school's student union. Florida State initially announced Winston would be suspended for the first half of the game after the sexual remark. However, Athletics Director Stan Wilcox increased the punishment the day before the game after hearing eyewitness accounts that differed from Winston's initial version, a source close to the situation told CNN's Rachel Nichols. In October, ESPN reported that more than 2,000 authenticated autographs by Winston were discovered online. However, Florida State said its athletic compliance department has not found evidence Winston accepted payment.","Winston categorically denies any rape claim in a statement .

"It is one of the most enduring mysteries of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, and for the families, it's a reason for hope. Why didn't Flight 370's emergency beacon work? Why didn't the beacon send a distress signal to satellites overhead? And the clincher: Why, if the beacon is designed to activate on impact, should we believe there was an impact? Could the plane have landed intact? Could the 239 passengers and crew still be alive? The issue resonates with some family members looking for hope where little exists. Of the 26 questions families recently presented to the Malaysian government, 12 addressed the beacon. Adding to the mystery: Hijackers or renegade pilots cannot disable some of the emergency beacons, namely, the ones attached to the plane's airframe.  They are powered by batteries and inaccessible to the crew. So by all accounts, the attached beacon on Flight 370 should have activated if the plane crashed. But experts consulted by CNN say there are numerous reasons why a beacon could fail in an ocean crash. The beacon itself could be damaged by the impact, or its antenna could be sheared from the fuselage, rendering it inoperable. And there's one other possibility considered even more likely by some: The crash impact may have actually activated the beacon, but the damaged plane sank in less than 50 seconds, the time necessary for it to transmit its first emergency signal. The beacons do not work underwater. On Friday, 49 days after Flight 370 disappeared, no one can say with certainty what happened with the plane's beacons. That has left some family members with a faint glimmer of hope, but others believing that the beacon system just failed. What are beacons? Beacons -- more formally called emergency locator transmitters, or ELTs -- are devices that transmit an electronic distress signal in the event of a crash. Unlike the so-called ""pingers,"" which help investigators zero in on a plane's black boxes, ELTs are intended to help rescuers locate the plane itself. And, unlike the pingers, they do not operate when submerged under water, owing to the natural laws that govern radio waves. Malaysia Flight 370 had four of them, Malaysian officials told CNN. Two of the ELTs were stored with the airplane's life raft, to be activated by hand or by contact with the water, if the life boats were deployed. The third ELT was stowed in the cabin. But the ELT of greatest interest is the remaining ""fixed"" ELT, mounted to the aircraft frame. The fixed ELT -- a Honeywell RESCU 406 AFN -- was positioned near the rear door and connected to an antenna on top of the aircraft. It could be activated, either manually by a pilot in the cockpit, or automatically upon impact, by an inertial ""G-switch."" The RESCU 406 AFN was designed ""to provide emergency transmission for aircraft flying over land,"" according to Honeywell's published specifications. ""They are not mandated or designed to work under water,"" a Honeywell spokesman told CNN. But experts say any impact -- whether on land or at sea -- likely would have activated the transmitter. Once activated, the device simultaneously transmits ""bursts"" -- short, digitally coded signals -- on three frequencies. Two of the frequencies -- 243 MHz and 121.5 MHz -- are VHF frequencies and can help search planes hone in on a target. The third frequency is 406 MHz. That's where satellites come in. Help from above . In 1979, the United States, Canada, France and the former Soviet Union teamed up to provide a global, satellite-based system to detect emergency beacons activated by planes, ships and backcountry hikers and to distribute those alerts to rescuers. Known as the International Cospas-Sarsat Programme, the enterprise claimed it made its first rescue in September 1982, saving three people involved in the crash of a light aircraft in Canada. ""Cospas-Sarsat has done an enormous amount of good in the world, but almost nobody has ever heard of us,"" said Steven Lett, an American diplomat and head of the Cospas-Sarsat Secretariat in Montreal. Cospas-Sarsat relies on six low-altitude, Earth-orbiting satellites and six high-altitude geostationary satellites, each with advantages and disadvantages. The six low-altitude satellites, whose main function is to provide meteorological information, orbit the poles and give complete but non-continuous coverage of the Earth's surface. Because they can only view a portion of the Earth at any given time, the satellite may need to store geographic information from an emergency beacon and rebroadcast it when it comes within view of a ground facility. The six geostationary satellites, parked in spots more than 22,000 miles above the equator, cover most of the Earth's surface but cannot determine the location of the beacon unless the location is encoded in the signal. All of the satellites listen for a beacon's 406 MHz signals and together can identify a beacon's location to within approximately 3 kilometers, or just under 2 miles. If Flight 370's ELT had transmitted a 406 MHz signal, it ""almost certainly would have been picked up by one of the geostationary satellites,"" Lett said.  Two satellites, India's Insat-3A and Russia's Electro-L1, are both parked over the Indian Ocean. It perhaps would have also been picked up by an orbiting low-altitude satellite. Australia, Singapore, Indonesia and China all have antennas that monitor the satellites' emergency transmitter. Some or all of them likely would have received the distress call. But authorities say no satellite signals were sent. No rescue was launched. Other rescues . Cospas-Sarsat said about five people are rescued every day with the assistance of the satellite system. But the disappearance of large commercial jetliners is very rare, and consequently, so is the discovery of them. Cospas-Sarsat said it was instrumental in finding a Varig Airlines B-737 that wandered off course and crashed in the Brazilian jungle in September 1989. And when a Turkish Airlines B-737 dropped off radar near Schiphol Airport in the Netherlands in 2009, an ELT alert was the first confirmation to controllers that the aircraft had crashed. The organization also said it was the primary or sole source of location information in about 25 other cases involving aircraft with 10 or more passengers. Somewhere in the Indian Ocean . What can explain the lack of a signal in the Flight 370 case? Assuming that the device was working correctly, the crash could have broken the antenna or cut the connection with the ELT, rendering it useless. Another possibility, experts say, is that the aircraft could have sunk before the ELT began transmitting. It takes 50 seconds for the ELT to establish the necessary connection. It only takes one half-second data ""burst"" to indicate there is an emergency. But it can take a half-dozen bursts -- at the rate of one every 50 seconds -- to provide information that will allow Cospas-Sarsat to triangulate the beacon's position. ""In this case, there wasn't even one burst, according to the reports that we received,"" Lett said. If the plane crashed in the southern Indian Ocean, as Malaysia Airline officials believe, the lack of a distress call could indicate that the plane plunged into the water, or sank quickly, because once underwater, the beacon is ineffective. Likewise, the water-triggered ELTs in the life rafts would be ineffective if they became submerged, according to published Honeywell manuals for the devices. Cospas-Sarsat also notes that beacons must have a relatively unobstructed view of the sky to work properly. ""A submerged beacon, or one with its antenna blocked by the body of an aircraft or vessel, is unlikely to be received by the satellites,"" the organization said. Said Honeywell Aerospace spokesman Steven Brecken: ""Until the recorders are recovered, we don't want to speculate what could or could not have happened. We ask the same thing you do, why didn't the ELT operate? We don't have the answer."" Family questions . In a recent letter to Malaysian authorities, a family group showered them with questions about the ELTs. How many ELTs are on the plane, they asked, adding that they had gotten conflicting numbers. Did Malaysia Airlines conduct maintenance checks? When was the latest check for MH370's ELT? They asked to see the results of those checks. Was the 406 MHz beacon certified? Was it possible to break the ELT in a crash?  Where exactly was it located? Would the ELT signal be weakened if it was surrounded by metal? Was the cable and blade antenna 9G certified?  How much impact is needed to activate the ELT?  Had the crew been trained in the use of ELTs? Can a beacon unlock ""and bounce [float] to the surface of the water?"" Many of the questions remain unanswered. But Cospas-Sarsat officials said that previous accidents have exposed shortcomings with the system and that they are working to improve it. Among other things, they are testing a new constellation of mid-altitude satellites that can better determine the location of an ELT. And government and industry officials are working on a new generation of ELTs that can monitor a plane conditions, identify problems and send a distress signal before the plane ever reaches the ground. Or the sea.","Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 had four beacons, or emergency locator transmitters .

"Sen. Rand Paul announced his bid for a second term in the Senate on Tuesday, launching what will likely be a complicated election season as he attempts to keep his seat and run for an expected presidential campaign. In a low-key campaign rollout, the Kentucky Republican declined to hold a traditional kick-off event, making the announcement instead in a lengthy press release that listed his local and national policy efforts. CNN Poll: Romney, Clinton top 2016 field . In fact, Paul wasn't even in Kentucky on Tuesday. He stayed in Washington for votes and to speak at a Wall Street Journal event. ""What he just decided was he didn't need a big rally and a lot of fan fare,"" Doug Stafford, Paul's senior adviser, said on a call with reporters. ""He wanted what he has done to speak for itself."" The problem for Paul is that Kentucky only allows candidates to appear on the ballot once during an election. If he runs for president--a decision he said Monday is ""four to six months"" away--that would pose a challenge come May 17, 2016, Kentucky's primary day. And if he wins the GOP nomination for both offices, the dilemma could come up again six months later on Election Day. Paul has a number of options to get around the law, but his team isn't saying — at least publicly— how they're prioritizing the different paths they could take. ""I don't think we've abandoned any option, nor have we settled on any option,"" Stafford said. 'Just to help Rand' Paul's allies in the Republican-controlled state Senate tried to change the law through the legislature last year, but the measure stalled in the Democratic-led Kentucky House. House Speaker Greg Stumbo, a Democrat who played an instrumental role in preventing the bill from advancing, said it would have violated a clause in Kentucky's Constitution that prohibits special legislation that would only affect one person or a small group of people. ""Where I come from, people think if you can't make up your mind on which office you want to run for, then you ain't fit to serve in either one,"" Stumbo said in an interview. How to run for president from the Senate . U.S. Rep. John Yarmuth, a Democrat who represents the Louisville area, said he doesn't think running for two offices will hurt Paul's chances with Kentucky voters. ""If you like him, you'll vote for him. If you don't like him, you won't vote for him,"" he said. ""In all fairness, I doubt if it will cost him any votes, just like it didn't seem to cost Paul Ryan any votes."" Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, as well as Vice President Joe Biden, both ran for their seats in Congress when they appeared as running mates on the 2012 and 2008 presidential ballots, respectively. Rand Paul dives back into Ferguson debate . The backlash, Yarmuth said, would come if Republicans were able to push through a law ""just to help Rand."" But that seems highly unlikely. Because Democrats were able to maintain control of the Kentucky House in the midterms, it looks like the law will stay in place. Going to court . Paul recently labeled the dilemma a ""fairness issue,"" pointing to other states where such a law doesn't exist. ""Should people who live in Minnesota get the chance to vote for one of their favorite sons or daughters twice, and people in Kentucky not?"" he said in an interview with the liberal-leaning news outlet Salon. ""I think eligibility for office has to be uniform across the states."" The U.S. Constitution requires only three qualifications for the Senate: The person must be at least 30, a citizen for at least nine years and an inhabitant of the state where he or she wants to be elected. In Paul's view, a law requiring him to appear on the ballot only once would be considered an additional qualification. ""The Constitution set the requirements for eligibility for office that states can't modify for federal office; they can modify for state office, but I think that's actually a case that could be won,"" he said. Rand Paul urges Congress to declare war on ISIS . A court challenge would be one of his options. Paul referenced a case known as Thornton vs. Term Limits in which the Supreme Court ruled that states don't have a right to add qualifications to federal offices. But Josh Douglas, a law professor at the University of Kentucky College of Law, said a legal challenge may be an uphill battle. ""It's not a slam dunk either way. I think the constitutional arguments are very difficult for him,"" he said, adding that state legislatures have wide leeway in deciding how to elect presidential candidates. The Supreme Court, he continued, has ruled in the past that there's no fundamental right to be a candidate. ""I don't think this law adds a qualification on him,"" Douglas said. Changing up the system . Another dual campaign possibility would be if the Kentucky Republican Party changes its presidential primary to a caucus or convention system. In that scenario, Paul's name wouldn't be on the ballot. ""That would overcome, really, I think, the problem there,"" Paul told Salon. Rand Paul: Obama declaring 'constitutional war' Stafford confirmed Tuesday that Paul's political team has been talking to the Kentucky GOP about changing the system, but he stressed that those discussions were already ongoing within the party and were not started by Paul. An earlier nominating contest in Kentucky would also bring more national attention to the state during a highly-anticipated election year. The state's GOP did not respond to a request for comment about the possibility. Doug Wead, an adviser to Paul and a former adviser to Paul's father, ex-Rep. Ron Paul, argued that it's a bold move for the state party to contemplate the idea. ""You either have to be a very popular person with the electorate, or you have to be a very powerful person with a lot of IOUs and a reputation for being tough to get away with it,"" Wead said. If Paul wins the GOP nomination, however, he'd still face the same problem in the November general election — when everything would be on the ballot. In that case, he would need to drop his senatorial bid. A third possibility would be for Paul to simply not appear on the Kentucky primary ballot as a presidential candidate. He has to decide by late January 2016 whether he'll file to be a candidate in the state's presidential primary. That deadline comes before the Iowa caucuses — the first-in-the-nation nominating contest — but a nearly a year after Paul will have already been campaigning. By that time, he'd have a better sense of where he stands in the GOP field. Yarmuth said he thinks that's probably Paul's best option. ""Just give up the Kentucky delegates and run for president in 49 states,"" he said. And based on previous primary calendars, the presumptive GOP nominee is usually decided long before May, so there's a chance Kentucky would not even be in play for Republican candidates.","Sen. Rand Paul announced he's running for re-election to the Senate .

"(CNN) -- Some people have a difficult time deciding what to give during the holiday season. For me, it couldn't be easier. That's not only because shopping for my husband, Bill, is so easy -- he's quite happy to receive books or jigsaw puzzles every year. It's also because there is a simple way that anyone can give a meaningful gift this time of year. And it's happening Tuesday. Just as there's Black Friday and Cyber Monday for finding great shopping deals, there's now #GivingTuesday for anyone who is feeling grateful this time of year and wants to share a bit of their good fortune with those in need. One of the best ways we've found to do that is to contribute to the U.N. Foundation's Shot@Life campaign. For just a few dollars, you can provide life-saving vaccines to children in the poorest countries. Living in the United States, most of us take vaccines for granted. We get them when we're children, and when we grow up to be parents, the pediatrician tells us when our child should get the next one. But that isn't the case in many parts of the world, where millions of children still aren't getting immunized against life-threatening diseases. Bill and I believe that vaccines are one of the real miracles of modern medicine. Over the last 50 years, they have saved more lives than any other medical innovation. Vaccines have nearly eliminated polio, and significantly reduced the incidence of life-threatening diseases such as measles, pneumonia and severe diarrhea. With vaccines, children have a much better chance of growing up healthy and becoming productive members of their community. Without vaccines, children are vulnerable to many deadly and disabling diseases. Today, more than 80% of children around the world receive a complete course of life-saving vaccines during their first year of life. That's incredible progress. Yet one in every five children -- mostly in the world's poorest communities -- don't get this level of protection. As a result, an estimated 1.5 million children under age 5 die each year from vaccine-preventable diseases. Thankfully, there are committed, compassionate people working to close this gap. Since 2000, one of our largest global health partners, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, has enabled 440 million children in developing countries to receive life-saving immunizations. This effort has saved the lives of 6 million children. At the community level, women in particular play a major role in helping children get the vaccines they need. In Pakistan and Nigeria, female health care workers risk their lives to get polio vaccines to children in areas of conflict. And mothers are most often the ones keeping track of their children's health records and making sure they get vaccinated. And there's another group -- people like you -- who can also make an important difference. Often, people say they don't believe they can really have an impact on big, global issues. The truth is, they can. In the 15 years that I've been doing this work, I've seen time and again that when lots of individuals take action it adds up to a movement that can achieve impact for women and children on a grand scale. And when it comes to vaccines, it's easy to have a real and lasting impact right now. For just a $5 contribution to Shot@Life, you can protect a young girl from polio and measles for her entire lifetime. For $15, you can protect a boy from the two most deadly diseases -- pneumonia and severe diarrhea. The more you're able to give, the more children you can help protect. And on #GivingTuesday, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is sponsoring a ""one day sale."" We will match any donation you make to Shot@Life, so your gift will go even further. No matter how much you decide to donate, giving a child a shot at a healthy life is one of the most meaningful gifts you can give this holiday season. When you help one child grow up healthy, you're helping an entire family. And healthy, thriving families help entire communities create a better world for all of us. A small gift can make a big difference.","Melinda Gates: Vaccines have saved more lives than any medical innovation .

"At Dragsholm Castle, on the northwestern coast of Denmark's Zealand island, they once chased ghosts. Now, along the beautiful forest paths that surround the 800-year-old castle, they chase edible flowers, wood sorrel and other wild ingredients that in recent years have pushed the country's restaurants to the forefront of global gastronomy. Dragsholm now stands as a beacon of Nordic terroir cooking, largely thanks to Claus Henriksen, a former chef at Copenhagen's world-beating Noma restaurant, who was drafted in seven years ago to head up its two restaurants. Today the castle is considered one of the truest representations of soil-to-plate dining. Add water, dunes, fields and forest to that equation and you get an idea of the rich and rewarding natural surroundings the chefs get to work with. Anyone spending the night here can practically pop down in their dressing gown and slippers to pick wild herbs for morning tea. It's well worth spending the night. The castle's historic rooms have been beautifully restored as hotel facilities. Baroque salons . Most of the suites are located along the corridors in between baroque salons and dining halls, and with views of the moat, garden or courtyard. They're fitted for modern comfort with whirlpool baths and distinctive period features such as canopy beds or chandeliers. There are no TVs to spoil the occasion, but coming to Dragsholm to watch television is missing the point. ""The habitat here is really fascinating,"" says Jorgen Stoltz, a forest ranger who organizes foraging safaris around the fields, waters and woodland near Dragsholm. The castle is located in the region of Odsherred, an area designated by UNESCO as a Geopark. ""There is a tension field between the geology created by the ice age, with clay and calcium-rich soil, and then the elevated seabed which came later,"" says Stoltz. ""We have all types of nature. You have sand dunes, which have been overgrown with juniper berries and thyme, and you can walk through lush forests full of ramsons (wild garlic)."" Foraging safaris take place from early spring until autumn. Stoltz preps novice foragers by giving them plant samples a set of photo fact sheets. He never picks or shows anything potentially toxic. ""If people see me holding a poisonous plant they will mistake it for being edible,"" he says. ""Some people are so keen and quick on the trigger to collect that they will pick up anything."" Beach herbs . Stoltz guides visitors through the soft forest ground, brimming in spring with wood sorrel and ramson, past the black cheery trees, which Henriksen uses in the castle kitchen for making breads and tea, and down the fields scattered with juniper bushes. From the elevated castle grounds there are views of nearby Nekselo bay where beach herbs peer up through the dunes and banks. ""In the summer there is arrowgrass, which tastes of coriander,"" says Stoltz. ""All year round we find scurvy grass, which is what the Vikings used to bring around Europe as a medicinal herb. We also call it wasabi wort because of its intensity, just like horseradish."" On a good day, glasswort, beach mustard and saltbush can also be found. Anyone here on a Wednesday morning might spot Henriksen lurking around the beach, scouring for ingredients and getting a firsthand briefing from nature of what his menu is going to look like. Dragsholm's first-floor restaurant, Spisehuset, has a relaxed bistro feel. One of its lunchtime favorites is potato salad and house-made ramson sausages sprinkled with wild herbs from the beach and forest. Downstairs in the cellar restaurant, underneath the whitewashed stones that arch over designer wooden tables, Henriksen realizes his idea of a gourmet experience dictated by seasons and produce. ""I try to create a cuisine that reflects the nature surrounding us,"" says Henriksen. ""It should represent this very moment in time. ""We are being very conscious about it, trying to keep it in tune with nature's rhythm."" Hubba Bubba flowers . While Henriksen has a basic blueprint for the food he's cooking, the weekly excursions to the beach and the woods is where he finesses his dishes. ""We might have veal tongues or sweetbreads as our starting points, but then we go out and see what we can find to pair it with,"" he says. On a recent autumn morning, Henriksen went to the fields to find wild violet flowers (""they taste like Hubba Bubba bubble gum""), which he put together with caramel mousse, thyme and rye bread. He used reduced seawater from the bay, rather than salt, to season the caramel. Down by a water hole in the forest, he stumbled on a bed of wild mint. ""It's completely crazy but it's not too minty,"" says Henriksen. ""If you made mojitos with it, it would be a disaster because it wouldn't add what you expected. Its aroma is very subtle and elegant. ""I use it to marinate meat, like a carpaccio, because it's not too perfumed or too overpowering."" Henriksen and Stoltz sometimes go on their own private foraging sessions where they talk tastes, plants and new ideas. When Henriksen was serving grilled breads on a stick -- a Danish children's favorite known as snobrod -- Stoltz suggested he try using branches from a black cherry tree. This, said Stoltz, would add almond flavor. Henriksen was so impressed that he ended up putting the branches through a wood chipper and used them to cook a syrup. ""You also have to evolve as a chef,"" said Henriksen. ""There might be some things you didn't initially like but all of a sudden you get into it. It changes all the time.""

"(CNN)  -- Maria Sharapova landed the Toray Pan Pacific Open title in Tokyo on Saturday as her final opponent Jelena Jankovic was forced to retire injured in the first set. Sharapova was winning her first title of 2009 after returning from injury. Unseeded Russian Sharapova was leading 5-2 when Jankovic pulled out with a right wrist injury. It is Sharapova's first title since returning to the WTA after being sidelined for 10 months after shoulder surgery. Serbian Jankovic claimed the opening two games, but Sharapova stormed back to claim the next five before the seventh seed signaled she could not continue. ""It was a tough start today. Jelena started off so strong,"" admitted tennis icon Sharapova. ""It was my second final of the year and I was a bit nervous. ""But I played well enough this week to know I could give her a good match. I just wanted to keep fighting out there and unfortunately Jelena had to stop,"" the 22-year-old added. Sharapova has taken advantage of a series of shocks in the $2 million tournament which saw world number one Dinara Safina and Venus Williams exit in the first round. Venus Williams was back in action in her opening round match at the China Open in Beijing on Saturday, but was made to fight hard by Russia's Vera Dushevina before coming through 6-2 7-6. The seven-time grand slam winner trailed 4-0 in the second set before claiming the next five games. Dushevina hit back to force a tiebreak which Williams claimed comfortably to reach the second round. The tournament is being held in conjunction with an ATP men's event with Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy Roddick in action when it gets underway on Monday. Sunday will see top seed Safina and second-ranked Serena Williams in action in the women's tournament with Sharapova granted a first round bye after her Tokyo heroics.","Maria Sharapova claims the Toray Pan Pacific Open title in Tokyo .

"A South Dakota boarding school that sends out more than 30 million pieces of mail every year pleading for money to help its Native American students now says it is changing the way it raises money after a CNN investigation. CNN reported that seemingly handwritten letters from a student called ""Josh Little Bear"" were signed by a student who was fictitious. U.S. Indian school's fund-raising letters sent to millions signed by fictitious kids . The marketing director for St. Joseph's Indian School in Chamberlain, South Dakota told CNN that the stories were broadly true but not specific to any single student. Those letters, in part, read: . ""Like other kids here, my home on the reservation isn't a safe place for me to be. My dad sometimes drinks and hits me. My mom ... didn't want me anymore. She chose drugs over me."" A black-and-white photograph at the top of the letter was said to be ""Josh Little Bear,"" even though the school said his name was ""changed"" to ""protect his privacy."" The school's president, Mike Tyrell, wrote CNN that the school has ""revisited"" the use of the ""letters attributed to our students."" ""While the stories in the letters were based on actual situations that some of our students have experienced,"" he wrote, ""using such letters may not be the best way to convey our students' challenges to our benefactors."" St. Joseph's publicly reported raising more than $51 million last year, nearly all of that money generated by the direct-mail appeals, which include ""DreamCatchers"" (made in China), stickers, notepads, address labels and calendars.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A series of newsletters in the name of GOP presidential hopeful Ron Paul contain several racist remarks -- including one that says order was restored to Los Angeles after the 1992 riots when blacks went ""to pick up their welfare checks."" This is a copy of one of the ""Ron Paul Political Report"" newsletters, which has stirred controversy. CNN recently obtained the newsletters -- written in the 1990s and one from the late 1980s -- after a report was published about their existence in The New Republic. None of the newsletters CNN found says who wrote them, but each was published under Paul's name between his stints as a U.S. congressman from Texas. Paul told CNN's ""The Situation Room"" Thursday that he didn't write any of the offensive articles and has ""no idea"" who did.  Watch Paul's full interview with CNN » . ""When you bring this question up, you're really saying, 'You're a racist' or 'Are you a racist?' And the answer is, 'No, I'm not a racist,'"" he said. Paul said he had never even read the articles with the racist comments.  See the newsletter excerpts for yourself » . ""I do repudiate everything that is written along those lines,"" he said, adding he wanted to ""make sure everybody knew where I stood on this position because it's obviously wrong."" But that's not good enough, says one political veteran. ""These stories may be very old in Ron Paul's life, but they're very new to the American public and they deserve to be totally ventilated,"" said David Gergen, a CNN senior political analyst. ""I must say I don't think there's an excuse in politics to have something go out under your name and say, 'Oh by the way, I didn't write that.'"" Paul, who is not considered a front-runner, has become an Internet phenomenon in the current race, raising tens of millions of dollars from a devoted online base, many of them young people drawn to his libertarian straight talk.  See where the money is coming from » . The controversial newsletters include rants against the Israeli lobby, gays, AIDS victims and Martin Luther King Jr. -- described as a ""pro-Communist philanderer."" One newsletter, from June 1992, right after the LA riots, says ""order was only restored in L.A. when it came time for the blacks to pick up their welfare checks."" Another says, ""The criminals who terrorize our cities -- in riots and on every non-riot day -- are not exclusively young black males, but they largely are. As children, they are trained to hate whites, to believe that white oppression is responsible for all black ills, to 'fight the power,' to steal and loot as much money from the white enemy as possible."" In some excerpts, the reader may be led to believe the words are indeed from Paul, a resident of Lake Jackson, Texas. In the ""Ron Paul Political Report"" from October 1992, the writer describes carjacking as the ""hip-hop thing to do among the urban youth who play unsuspecting whites like pianos."" The author then offers advice from others on how to avoid being carjacked, including ""an ex-cop I know,"" and says, ""I frankly don't know what to make of such advice, but even in my little town of Lake Jackson, Texas, I've urged everyone in my family to know how to use a gun in self defense. For the animals are coming."" In his interview with CNN, Paul said that's language he would never use. ""People who know me, nobody is going to believe this,"" he said. ""That's just not my language. It's not my life."" He added, ""Martin Luther King, Rosa Parks, Ghandi, they're the heroes [of my life]."" Matt Welch, the editor-in-chief of ""Reason"" magazine who shares some of Paul's beliefs on big government, says he has never heard the congressman make racist comments like those in the newsletters. ""What I think some people are looking for him to do is to say, 'OK, who wrote that?' I mean, there's 20 years, give or take, worth of newsletters there,"" Welch said. Paul said the editor of publications ""is responsible for daily activities."" But he also cited ""transition"" and ""changes"" and said that some people were hired to write stories ""but I didn't know their names."" The presidential hopeful described the newsletter revelations as a ""rehash"" of old material dug up by his opponents because he is gaining ground with black voters due to his stance against the war in Iraq and the war on drugs. ""I am the anti-racist because I am the only candidate -- Republican or Democrat -- who would protect the minority against these vicious drug laws,"" he said.

"Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim says the captain of MH 370 is a card-carrying member of his party -- and an extremely distant relative -- but he dismissed suggestions the pilot may have diverted the plane as a political act in his support. Hours before the Malaysia Airlines flight vanished en route to Beijing on March 8, Anwar, de facto leader of the People's Justice Party, was sentenced to five years in jail after a court overturned his 2012 acquittal on a sodomy charge. Some media outlets have reported that the plane's pilot, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, had attended the court hearing, and speculated that the flight's disappearance may have been a political act in response to the verdict. As authorities increasingly focused their attentions on events in the cockpit, the homes of Zaharie and First Officer Fariq Abdul Hamid were searched, and a homemade flight simulator found in Zaharie's home, Malaysian officials revealed.. Anwar, who is free pending appeal, told CNN his party had been unable to establish whether Zaharie had been in attendance at court, although a number of his friends had reported he had been ""upset and disgusted"" by the outcome. The opposition leader recognized photographs of Zaharie from political meetings, and subsequently established he was a member of his party -- and a distant relative of his daughter-in-law. However, he labeled the suggestion that Zaharie could have steered the airliner from its designated flight path as a political act as ""grossly unfair"" to the missing pilot. WATCH: Politics of MH 370 pilot questioned . He alleged that the speculation had only gained traction as a result of the government trying to deflect attention from its ""incompetent"" handling of the crisis. ""I think there's a desperation by the government of the ruling leadership over the manner they managed the whole crisis. Clearly incompetent, contradictory statements, poor management of the crisis,"" he said. ""In order to deflect that, their own failure, their own incompetence, they now choose to attack me,"" he said. ""They fail on every count... They're now desperate to cast aspersions against me as leader of the opposition."" Malaysian political scientist Wong Chin Huat said that while close scrutiny of the potential motivations of anyone onboard is warranted, he believes the speculated link to Malaysian domestic politics was a ""red herring."" ""Had the captain intended to cause this incident in protest, there should be clearly some clue. It's pointless to make a political statement in silence, that leaves everyone guessing where you are going,"" he said, adding that such drastic actions would be unprecedented in Malaysian politics. He had seen no evidence to back up Anwar's claim that the theory had been promulgated by Malaysian authorities to distract from their handling of the crisis, but said that such an explanation was ""very possible."" ""You have a one-party state run by princelings that demonstrates very poor leadership and very chaotic coordination -- poor leadership and chaotic coordination that has been distracted from by this red herring,"" he said. Malaysian government officials declined to respond to Anwar's comments. Anwar has repeatedly said he is innocent of a charge he sodomized a former aide, calling the case against him an attempt by the government to end his political career. The Malaysian government has consistently denied his accusations. When asked at a news conference Tuesday about the Anwar angle, Malaysia's Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said that the issue was above politics, and that speculation linking the plane's disappearance to Anwar's sentencing had come from foreign media, not by his government.

"The cricketing world has been rocked by fresh revelations over alleged fixing by former New Zealand internationals, following the leak of player statements made to a corruption inquiry. The scandal has prompted ex-Black Caps star Chris Cairns to confirm that he is ""Player X"" -- the prominent former international accused in the statements of pressuring others to fix in matches -- while rejecting the allegations against him and vowing to clear his name. ""I have not denied I am Player X,"" he wrote in a series of tweets Tuesday. ""It's the allegations I reject... Thanks for all the support out there and to all those who understand that there are bigger forces at play here."" The International Cricket Council's Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) has previously confirmed it was conducting an investigation into Cairns and fellow former New Zealand internationals Lou Vincent and Daryl Tuffey. Cairns, considered one of the game's leading all-rounders in his day, has challenged match-fixing allegations in the courts in the past, and won. In 2012, he sued Indian cricket official and businessman Lalit Modi in a British court, after Modi had tweeted allegations of match-fixing relating to Cairns' stint with the Chandigarh Lions in the short-lived Indian Cricket League (ICL). Cairns captained the side in 2007 and 2008, playing alongside Vincent in 2008. Modi, who ran the rival Indian Premier League competition, lost his appeal against the court's decision in October 2012, with damages increased to £90,000 ($147,459). Tuffey, a bowler who played his last Test for New Zealand in 2010, also denies any involvement in fixing. In the latest revelations, Vincent is reported to have told ACSU investigators he fixed in at least 12 games in five countries from 2008 to 2012, beginning with his time with the Chandigarh Lions. He then reportedly continued to fix in the English county competition, and the Twenty20 Champions League, using tactics such as changing the color of his bat handle to show that a fix was occurring. 'Hero' and friend . According to the reports, Vincent, 35, identified six other players he believes were involved in fixing, and told investigators he had been drawn into the practice under the influence of a prominent former international -- referred to by the press as Player X -- whom he felt he could not refuse. New Zealand's current captain Brendon McCullum also reportedly told investigators that a friend and ""hero"" had twice attempted to persuade him to fix, first in India ahead of the start of the inaugural Indian Premier League in 2008, then shortly afterwards in England during a New Zealand tour. McCullum reportedly refused the advances, which allegedly included an offer of more than £100,000, and advice on how to launder any illicit gains through the purchase of property in Dubai. New Zealand Cricket CEO David White stressed that McCullum was not under investigation by the ICC, and expressed dismay his testimony had been leaked to media. ""I can confirm that Brendon is not under investigation by the ICC and in fact his testimony has been applauded by them,"" White said. ""He was approached to match-fix, he has refused that and reported it to the ICC. Brendan has done the right thing. We believe this is brave and courageous, and he has shown a great example as an international captain."" Heath Mills, chief executive of the New Zealand Cricket Players' Association, also criticized the leak of the players' statements, saying it ""completely undermines any trust or confidence players may have in cricket's anti-corruption systems."" 'A complete lie' In response to the claims, Cairns issued a statement describing the allegations against him as a ""complete lie."" ""Lou Vincent... appears to have confessed to match fixing in respect of games played in numerous countries around the world, most of which I have had no connection to,"" read the statement from the 43-year-old, who made his Test debut in 1989 and played his last one-day international in 2006. ""He is in a desperate position. He faces potential prosecution and in trying to negotiate a plea bargain he appears to be willing to falsely accuse me of wrongdoing."" In regard to McCullum's allegations, he wrote: ""I have no idea why he would say the things he is alleged to have said. To be clear, I have never approached Brendon, or anyone else, about match-fixing or any other improper activity. ""I have nothing to hide."" The son of former New Zealand cricket great Lance Cairns, Cairns played for New Zealand's test and one-day team and captained the side on a number of occasions. CNN affiliate TVNZ reported that Vincent's ex-wife had also testified to investigators that Cairns was the ringleader behind the alleged ICL fixing, providing a sworn statement to ACSU that said: ""Lou said Chris was going to pay him US$50,000 a game for the fixing."" TVNZ reported she said Vincent had met a stranger with a briefcase full of money in India, and that she and her husband ""fell out about the whole ICL fixing thing, as I didn't want him to be involved, but Lou kept saying, 'Don't worry we're all doing it.'"" She claimed her ex-husband had once called her in tears, saying he owed hundreds of thousands of dollars after his attempts to fix had gone wrong, TVNZ reported. Lily-white? New Zealand regularly ranks as one of the world's least corrupt countries, recently topping Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index alongside Denmark. New Zealand sportswriter Joseph Romanos said the allegations of corruption surrounding celebrated athletes in the country's summer game had come as a shock to many. ""New Zealanders, perhaps unrealistically, think of themselves as fairly lily-white in terms of match-fixing and banned drugs in sport,"" he told CNN. ""It's always a huge shock when someone's done -- although when you catalog it all, we can mix it with the best of them on the wrong side of the line."" Australian cricket writer Gideon Haigh said New Zealand players may have been targeted for approaches as the country had had the highest number of defectors to the ""rebel"" ICL competition, and were ""comparatively speaking poorly paid by international standards."" ""I guess they were the first targets of ICL recruiting agents and therefore became exposed to a tournament where really nothing hinged on the outcome and the amounts being paid were far more than the individual players were worth,"" he told CNN. ""Nothing is more conducive to corruption than meaningless cricket, and sums of money that are odds with the scale and importance of the game."" Recent scandals . International cricket has been plagued by the specter of match-fixing in recent years, with three Pakistani players banned by the ICC and sentenced by a British court for spot fixing during a Test match against England at Lord's in 2010. In August last year, seven were charged in Bangladesh with match-fixing; former national captain Mohammad Ashraful had previously confessed to fixing matches. And in October, six international umpires were stood down following an India TV expose which alleged officials were willing to fix matches at the recent T20 World Cup in exchange for payment. Haigh said the game's administrators had failed to keep pace with developments in the south Asian gambling market. ""Under the present climate where vast quantities (of money) have entered the game over the past 10 years and the game is still trying to operate under institutional structures that were devised during the 20th century, I think cricket's got a lot of catching up to do,"" he said. He wasn't confident that administrators would tackle the problem anytime soon. ""Frankly, they simply haven't been focused on this. They've been too busy attempting to make money themselves,"" Haigh said. ""It took a very, very long time for cycling to take seriously the issue of doping. It's amazing how long administrators can stave off doing anything serious."" He said if a broadcaster or major sponsor took a stance on corruption in the game, it could help efforts to driver out fixers. Until then, fans would be left wondering every time they saw something out of the ordinary on the pitch. ""I suppose the worst thing is the not knowing,"" said Haigh. ""Once the hint of corruption enters into cricket, it becomes very difficult for you to take pleasure in its inherent unpredictability.""

"As education scandals go, the news that students at some of the best high schools on Long Island paid others to take their College Board tests seems mild. The Long Island scandal pales behind the sex scandal at Penn State. Yet the fears driving the Long Island scandal come with much broader educational implications than those affecting Penn State. The cheating scandal reflects the tyranny that standardized testing has come to exercise over higher education in America. Just before Thanksgiving, Nassau County district attorney Kathleen Rice leveled criminal charges against 13 students for their part in the Long Island testing scandal. Rice was right to treat as a criminal matter the testing fraud, which, after seven arrests in September, now includes 20 Long Island students. Two more suspects turn themselves in . But if colleges and high schools sit back and regard the Long Island scandal as primarily a security issue to be corrected by better policing, they are failing in their mission. They bear a huge responsibility for the degree to which a high score on a standardized test has become disproportionately important for college admission. The Long Island testing scandal reflects the extent to which high school students across the country are responding to what their teachers and colleges are telling them will bring success. They are acting on the premise that in the race to gain admission to the nation's most prestigious schools, getting a high score on the ACT or College Board tests is the equivalent of winning the lottery. This obsessive focus is exactly the opposite of the generous ideal that in 1934 led Harvard president James Bryant Conant to pioneer the use of the SAT, Scholastic Aptitude Test, for admission to Harvard. Conant's aim was to find worthy students in schools across the country who were not part of the elite private school system from which Harvard traditionally drew most of its students. Today, Conant's approach to the SAT is an anachronism. As Thomas Espenshade and Alexandria Radford show in their study of race and class in college admissions, ""No Longer Separate, Not Yet Equal,"" selective colleges give blacks a 310-point bonus and Hispanics a 130-point bonus on the SAT test in order to achieve a measure of diversity. But that practice has not changed colleges' overall reliance on the SAT test as a guide to admissions. Colleges vie with one another to get the highest testers they can find, and the prestigious U.S. News and World ranking of colleges and universities makes admissions test scores a key factor in its influential rating system. The question colleges and universities need to ask themselves is what can they do to lessen the educational testing equivalent of the old nuclear arms race. The short answer is treat standardized tests, which all too often correlate with income, with greater skepticism. The long answer is for colleges to balance their use of the tests with a more complex look at their applicants than is now common practice. I teach at a college that has completely dropped requiring ACT and SAT tests for admissions. We found  the tests revealed more about students' racial and economic backgrounds than abilities, but I am aware that such a radical departure from the norm is out of the question for most schools -- especially the flagship state universities that are swamped with thousands upon thousands of applications. What is, however, possible for all colleges to do is reduce the weight they give the ACT and SAT tests and thereby reduce students' obsession with their test scores. There are a number of ways to bring about this change, but two stand out as the most practical. The first step is for colleges to increase the size of their admissions staffs so  the staffs can look more closely at prospective students' writing samples, grades and references. Colleges speak about considering the overall potential of a student, but that is an empty claim when overworked admissions officers are struggling just to keep up with the paperwork they face. For a second step, every college that can afford it should make a commitment to interview as many of its strong applicants as possible. This may mean paying for a campus visit by a future scholarship student or sending admissions staffers on trips across the country, but the effort is worth it. An interview, if conducted skillfully, is difficult to fake. It gives individual students the chance to explain who they are free from coaching by parents or paid college advisers. Such measures don't guarantee that we will be able to avoid future testing scandals, but their promise is superior to relying solely on the better-policing strategy -- epitomized by the October decision of the College Board, which administers the SAT test, to hire the firm headed by Louis J. Freeh, the former head of the F.B.I., to investigate its security measures. By expanding the window through which they view applicants, colleges and universities can reduce the incentives anxious students and their parents currently have to game the system. They can even make the whole student the person they pursue.","On Long Island, 20 students have  been arrested for cheating on SAT .

"(CNN) -- In homes all across America, working parents struggle to pay their bills at the end of the month. College graduates move back in with their parents because student loan debts are so high. Young families juggle two jobs just to afford their rising health care premiums. These are the problems Americans face every single day, in every state across the country. As the heads of the Republican communications offices in the House and the Senate, it's our job to listen to these problems and share Republican solutions. Our party has heard Americans' concerns, and that's why we've put forward hundreds of bills to help grow the economy, create jobs, expand opportunity and give American families hope for tomorrow. Our conversations with people back home, from the supermarket to the church pews to the doctor's office, have helped us develop legislative solutions that will make life better for Americans in every corner of this country. The House Republican majority has passed one jobs bill after another -- bills like the Small Business Capital Access and Job Preservation Act, which eliminates costly regulations for small and medium-size businesses, and which passed the House with the support of 36 Democrats. The House passed the America's Small Business Tax Relief Act, which gives small businesses more certainty by making permanent the maximum expensing allowance at $500,000, and the measure passed with the support of 53 Democrats. And House Republicans advanced the bipartisan Hire More Heroes Act, which would help America's veterans get back to work by excluding them from Obamacare's employer mandate threshold and therefore incentivizing businesses to hire them, and that legislation passed the House with almost unanimous Democratic support. And those are just the beginning. Unfortunately, once these bills go to the Democrat-led Senate, their progress comes to an abrupt halt. Scores of jobs bills and other important legislation are currently gathering dust on Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's desk. The same thing has happened to Senate Republicans. Senate Republicans have put forward numerous bills to help create jobs and opportunities and solve the challenges facing working families, but Reid has resolutely refused to allow any of them to come to the floor. And Senate Republicans have repeatedly been prevented from offering amendments to Democrat bills, including amendments that would have garnered bipartisan support, like an amendment to repeal Obamacare's burdensome medical device tax. While the Democratic majority in Washington refuses to debate the challenges facing the American people, Republicans continue to introduce solutions. While Reid ties up the Senate with political gimmicks and boutique bills designed to appeal to Democrats' far-left base -- like this month's effort to erase the free speech clause of the First Amendment with a proposed constitutional amendment on campaign contributions that would have empowered incumbent politicians to suppress the speech of their constituents -- Republicans move forward pro-jobs, pro-growth legislation that will get Americans back to work. While Democrats stand in the way of 21st-century solutions that will move our economy forward, Republicans continue to advance them. The contrast between the two parties couldn't be more clear: Republicans are working to create jobs for Americans. Democrats are working to save their own. American families can't afford to keep waiting for Senate Democrats to get their act together. Unemployment is high, and jobs and opportunities are few and far between. Obamacare has driven up health care premiums and significantly reduced health care choices for some Americans. Gas prices have risen by 84% since President Obama took office. And household income has fallen by about $2,600. Right now, too many Americans are struggling to make ends meet, support their families, pay their premiums and get back to work. In fact, nearly one in three Americans says their financial situation has gotten worse in the past year. We want to make it better. Americans need solutions. But as long as Reid continues to obstruct meaningful legislation in the Senate, they're not going to get them. The American people should not have to endure another two-year solutions blockade from Senate Democrats. The Senate needs a new majority with leaders who understand that they were elected to govern and who will work with the House to actually pass legislation to address America's challenges and provide the relief hard-working American families need: more jobs, increased take-home pay and more opportunities for advancement, expanded workplace flexibility, lower energy prices and real health care reform that will lower costs and put patients in charge. It's our hope that when Congress reconvenes next year, there will be new leadership in the Senate. We need leaders who will create opportunities, not stand in the way of them. We're ready and waiting to get things done for the American people. We just need willing partners.

"When Novak Djokovic ended Rafael Nadal's eight-year reign at the Monte Carlo Masters in April, it marked the perfect start to the world No. 1's clay-court season. But Djokovic's ensuing performances on clay haven't been anywhere near as impressive. After losing his opening match to Grigor Dimitrov at the Madrid Masters last week, Djokovic fell in the quarterfinals of the Rome Masters on Friday against a player who he previously held a 13-1 record against. Tomas Berdych rallied from a set down to beat Djokovic 2-6, 7-5, 6-4, denting the Serb's preparations for the French Open, which begins May 26. Djokovic couldn't serve out the match at 5-3 in the second set. ""I lost the concentration,"" Djokovic told reporters. ""I started playing more defensively. I played a bad game at 5-3 and the match turned around. He started playing more confidently, stepping into the court and taking advantage of his opportunities. ""It's a very strange situation. I played very well and was two points from winning. Then the entire match changed and I was a different player."" Djokovic's defeat opened the door for Nadal and the defending champion continued his mastery over fellow Spaniard David Ferrer. Nadal prevailed 6-4, 4-6, 6-2 to improve to 16-1 against Ferrer on clay -- Ferrer won their first match in 2004 -- and set up a showdown with Berdych in a repeat of the 2010 Wimbledon final, which Nadal won. If Nadal claims the title in Rome, he will leapfrog Ferrer to No. 4 in the rankings in time for the French Open seedings. Frenchman Benoit Paire beat Marcel Granollers 6-1, 6-0 to advance to his first Masters semifinal and will face Roger Federer in the last four. Meanwhile in the women's draw, a repeat of the Madrid final between the world's top two failed to materialize when Maria Sharapova withdrew from her quarterfinal with home favorite Sara Errani due to illness. Sharapova, the reigning French Open champion, lost to Serena Williams in straight sets in the Spanish capital. ""I was already a bit off in Madrid and played through it and it came back last night,"" Sharapova said. ""And I got sick again and it's not smart to compete again two or three rounds to win the tournament and with Paris starting next week. ""The doctor thinks I didn't take it easy last week and if I don't take care of it now, then it might worsen. It is one of those things, and the body is not ready and with a bigger goal around the corner it's important to make the right and smart decisions. I have a lot of clay matches and so this is not lacking before the French Open."" Williams crushed Carla Suarez Navarro in under an hour to extend her winning streak to a personal best 22 matches and next meets Romanian qualifier Simona Halep in the semifinals.

"This is one hotel where getting stuck with a ""city view"" could be frustrating. A new midtown Marriott -- The Courtyard-Residence Inn Central Park -- is claiming the title of North America's tallest hotel. Opened December 29, the $320 million, 68-story building houses two separate hotels -- a Courtyard and a Residence Inn -- at 1717 Broadway. The Courtyard's 378 rooms are located on floors 6-33, while the 261-suite Residence Inn is housed on the upper level floors 37-65. The latter is only available for stays of five nights or more. A 60-second time-lapse video of the 27 months of the hotel's construction can be seen here. Located five blocks from Central Park and about 10 minutes from Times Square, the dual-branded hotel offers valet parking, a bistro, 6,000 square feet of meeting space, an outdoor sun deck and Wi-Fi included in the room rate. According to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH), the 750-foot new Marriott beats out a sister hotel for the title -- the 727-foot Detroit Marriott at the Renaissance Center. Neither comes close to being the tallest hotel in the world, however. Many of the world's tallest hotels are in Dubai, with the tallest being another Marriott -- the 1,164-foot JW Marriott Marquis. The new Marriott's claims are being contested by another U.S. hotel, the Westin Peachtree Plaza in Atlanta. Although CTBUH and other websites list the Plaza as being 723 feet tall, hotel reps say its real height is 754 feet, which would make it taller than the Courtyard-Residence Inn Central Park by four feet.

"Pope Francis said on Tuesday that modern slavery is a ""crime against humanity"" and is ""unfortunately becoming worse and worse every day."" ""This takes place in hiding, behind closed doors, in private homes, in the streets, in the cars, in factories, in the fields, in fishing boats, and in so many other places,"" the Pope said through an interpreter during a panel discussion Tuesday led by CNN's Christiane Amanpour. ""This takes place both in cities and in villages -- in villages of the richest and the poorest nations on earth."" A diverse group of faith leaders gathered at the Vatican on Tuesday to sign a declaration pledging to ""inspire spiritual and practical action by all global faiths and people of good will everywhere"" to eradicate slavery by the year 2020. Leaders and representatives of Catholic, Anglican and Orthodox Christianity, Judaism, Shiite and Sunni Islam, Buddhism and Hinduism all were present and signed the initiative. CNN has championed the cause of eradicating slavery, having launched its Freedom Project in March 2011. An estimated 35.8 million people are enslaved, according to the Global Slavery Index. As the Pope pointed out, the problem is far from limited to developing countries: More than 60,000 people are estimated to be enslaved in the United States, more than 10,000 in Germany and more than 1,000 in Sweden. Most victims in Europe and Central Asia are forced into sexual exploitation, the United Nations says; in East Asia and the Pacific region, most are used for forced labor. ""The victims come from all walks of life, but most times they are the poorest and the most vulnerable of our brothers and sisters,"" Francis said. The joint declaration calls modern slavery a ""crime against humanity,"" and says that eradication in less than a decade is achievable. ""Today we have the opportunity, awareness, wisdom, innovation and technology to achieve this human and moral imperative,"" it states.

"(CNN)Thrust from obscurity to notoriety overnight, Captain Francesco Schettino is the man at the center of recriminations over the Costa Concordia cruise ship disaster. The liner capsized after it struck rocks off Italy's Giglio Island in the Tyrrhenian Sea in January 2012. No one died on impact but 32 lives were lost during the subsequent chaotic evacuation of the 4,200 people on board the ship. On Wednesday, an Italian court found Schettino guilty of manslaughter and other charges related to the wreck, and sentenced him to 16 years in prison. Over the past two years, the judges in the captain's trial have heard from a wide variety of people, including passengers, crew members and technical experts. Just before the judges got the case, the captain took the opportunity to speak again. Breaking down in tears, Schettino recalled that January day three years ago. ""I died along with the 32 others,"" he said. And since then, Schettino insisted, he's become a victim, processed by a ""media meat grinder."" Schettino, 52 at the time of the accident, admitted he had been ""showboating"" when he sailed the luxury cruise liner so close to the island of Giglio, where submerged rocks tore through the hull. However, he said earlier the rocks were uncharted, and he did everything he could to preserve the lives of crew and passengers. The captain has previously pointed the finger at the Indonesian helmsman, whom he said did not speak English or Italian well enough to understand his orders, as well as the Costa cruise company for not providing maps with the rocks he hit appropriately marked. READ MORE: How Costa Concordia was raised . Schettino has also blamed the ship itself, saying the generators did not work so the elevators did not function, hindering some people's escape. Schettino's lead lawyer Domenico Pepe began closing arguments on Monday by saying the champagne bottle used to christen the ship when it was put into service in 2006 did not break. ""Everything about this ship and this process since then has been a mystery so far,"" he said. Earlier in the trial Moldovan dancer Dominca Cemortan, who dined with the captain and was with him on the command bridge, gave evidence for the prosecution. Cemortan boarded the ship as a passenger but had worked on another Costa Cruises ship captained by Schettino a few weeks earlier. The dancer admitted on the stand under duress that she and Schettino had a sexual relationship, something the captain had previously denied. She also accused Schettino of calling for a helicopter to rescue him, which he has denounced her for in a separate lawsuit. A native of Castellamare di Stabbia, near the southern city of Naples, Schettino comes from a seafaring family, Italy's Corriere della Sera newspaper reports. He graduated from the well-regarded Nino Bixio nautical institute in Piano di Sorrento, in Naples province, 30 years ago, according to the news agency Adnkronos. He joined Costa in 2002 as a safety officer, served as a staff captain, and was appointed captain in 2006, according to the cruise line. Like all Costa masters, Schettino was ""constantly trained, passing all tests."" Costa chairman Pier Luigi Foschi, who retired after the disaster, had said Schettino had never been involved in an accident before. However, in court it was revealed that in June 2010 he scraped his ship, the Aida Blu, against a port wall in Germany. After the 2012 accident Foschi played down the possibility that alcohol played a role in the disaster, saying he did not believe Schettino drank, and that all crew were subject to random drug and alcohol tests by Costa Cruises. But Foschi placed the blame for the wreck squarely on the captain, saying it was his choice to deviate from frequently traveled routes in order to ""impress the passengers,"" as Schettino admitted. Schettino is also accused of abandoning his passengers, who were unable to look after themselves, and to whom he had a responsibility as captain, when he left the ship before they did. Pepe tried to explain why his client left the ship ahead of so many passengers. He used a graphic to illustrate the inclination of the ship at the time Schettino apparently lost his balance and fell into the lifeboat that took him to shore. He said that once on shore, Schettino was able to conduct the rescue operation and that he never lost control of the operation. The attorney also addressed the famous exchange between Gregorio De Falco -- commander of the Livorno Port Authority the night of the accident -- and Schettino, during which De Falco told Schettino to ""get back on board for f**k's sake."" Pepe called De Falco's tone degrading and said the commander was unprofessional and egotistic at a moment when he should have been a voice of calm. Schettino initially appears to play down the scale of the disaster, saying only that a ""technical failure"" has occurred. He then tells an official he has abandoned the vessel, according to the transcripts, which prosecutors say match those used in their investigation. But as the official questions his decision, Schettino appears to reverse course and says he did not abandon ship but was ""catapulted into the water"" after the ship ran into a rock, began taking on water and started listing. As the night unfolds, the coast guard commander repeatedly questions why Schettino, as captain, is not on the ship when passengers are still aboard. But Schettino appears unwilling either to go back on board or to take charge of the desperate evacuation efforts, the transcripts reveal. In addition to questions over how Schettino handled himself after the wreck, questions also lingered about whether the captain should have ordered an evacuation sooner and why no ""mayday"" distress signal was sent.

"(CNN)Rafael Nadal insists he is on the ""right path"" in his latest comeback but his defense of the Rio Open title was ended in a late night defeat to Italy's Fabio Fognini -- snapping an incredible record in ATP Tour semifinal matches on his favorite clay surface. Nadal had racked up 52 straight wins over 12 years to reach title matches, but the battling Fognini ended the streak with a 1-6 6-2 7-5 victory. He will meet Nadal's fellow Spaniard David Ferrer in Sunday's final. Nadal, whose 2014 was disrupted by injury and illness after winning a record ninth French Open title, has struggled since his return to action, losing in the first round in Qatar and the quarterfinals of the Australian Open. But returning to clay in Brazil, the world number three was a firm favorite to repeat his success of last year and had a winning 4-0 record over Fognini going into their last four encounter. But after cruising to the first set, his opponent adopted a more aggressive approach and forced a deciding set. Nadal, trailing 5-6 in the third set, finally cracked as Fognini converted his third match point after a stunning rally, closing out victory after two hours 17 minutes. ""I'm really happy about this match,"" Fognini told the official ATP Tour website. ""I beat the best player on this surface. Rafa is always difficult. From the second set I played really well, and I tried to change a little bit to be more positive on court."" The match finished after midnight Saturday local time and Nadal had been kept on court until 3.30 am in his quarterfinal win over Uruguayan Pablo Cuevas, but he refused to make excuses. ""I have to accept the situation and work to get ready for what's next,"" he said. ""I'm working well, I have the right attitude, I have to improve things and I think that I'm on the right path and closer to the level of game that I'm looking for."" The 27-year-old Fognini, who had himself been kept on court late Friday night in his last eight clash with Argentine Federico Delbonis, will be bidding for his fifth ATP Tour title, but has never beaten Ferrer in seven previous matches. Nadal will now head to the ATP clay court event in Buenos Aires, Argentina as he steps up his preparations to win a 10th French Open at Roland Garros later this year. But his fourth defeat on clay in the course of the year, to Ferrer in Monte Carlo, world number one Novak Djokovic in Rome and Nicolas Almagro in Barcelona were the others, leaves question marks over Nadal's bid to make further history. In other ATP Tour action, fifth seed Gilles Simon beat French compatriot Gael Monfils 6-4 1-6 7-6 Sunday to win the title in Marseille. It was the 12th career title for the 30-year-old Simon, while seventh seed Monfils slipped to 5-17 in finals. On the WTA Tour, Simona Halep of Romania beat the Czech Republic's Karolina Pliskova 6-4 7-6 in the final of the Dubai Championships. It was her 10th career title and will lift Halep to third in the world rankings behind Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova. Halep eventually prevailed after a marathon second set lasting over an hour, wasting two match points as she served for the match at 5-4 and 6-5, before edging the tiebreaker.","Rafael Nadal slips to shock defeat in Rio .

"Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is acknowledging he may have to consider recommendations to place ground forces in Iraq to help forces there locate targets if, in fact, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff makes that recommendation. But these would not be fighting forces, Hagel said. ""There will be no American combat troops in Iraq or Syria."" Gen. Martin Dempsey has suggested at least twice that a recommendation of ground troops could come, although he has emphasized he has not made that proposal yet. He has also said that he doesn't ""foresee a circumstance when it would be in our interest to take this fight on ourselves with a large military contingent."" The general landed in Iraq on Saturday to make a first-hand assessment of the situation. ""If we get to any other variation of recommendations from General Dempsey, we will deal with it, but we are not there yet,"" Hagel told CNN in an interview Saturday at the end of a daylong seminar on national security strategy at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California. Obama: No change of mind . At the G20 summit in Australia, President Obama said that he had not changed his mind about U.S. ground forces when it comes to Iraq. He still does not plan to deploy them, and Dempsey ""has not advised me that I should be sending U.S. troops to fight,"" he said. But the President did not rule it out completely, if confronted with the most dire of dangers. ""There are always circumstances, in which the United States might need to deploy ground troops,"" Obama said. ""If we discovered that ISIL had gotten possession of a nuclear weapon, and we had to run an operation to get it out of their hands, then yes, you can anticipate that not only would Chairman Dempsey recommend me sending U.S. ground troops to get that weapon out of their hands, but I would order it."" Obama critics . Hagel declined to answer whether any of the top leadership of the Khorasan Group have been killed by U.S. airstrikes in Syria, but said the group still poses a serious threat. ""We know they are planning and plotting attacks against our interests, Europe specifically. So, yes, that is why we target them."" Hagel was joined in the seminar by Republican Sen. John McCain from Arizona, former defense secretaries Leon Panetta and Robert Gates, as well as Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. The issue of whether the White House and the Pentagon have a sufficient strategy to deal with ISIS dominated much of several panel discussions. In blistering criticism of President Barack Obama and the Pentagon, McCain said, ""No one outside the Joint Chiefs of Staff believes we have a strategy"" to defeat and degrade ISIS, as set forth by  the administration. Panetta and Gates have recently written books which have criticized Obama. In his remarks, Gates likened Obama to President Lyndon B. Johnson in what he called ""micromanagement"" of military policy and targeting during the Vietnam War. Jeh Johnson said ""uppermost"" in his mind is that a lone wolf attack inspired by ISIS could strike the United States at a moment's notice.

"The U.S. Army's new ban on many types of ethnic hairstyles has African-American women who wear their coifs in dreadlocks, braids and cornrows in a twist. The Army's regulations stipulate such guidance as hair ""must be of uniform dimension, small in diameter (approximately ¼ inch), show no more than 1/8 (inch) of the scalp between the braids."" Dreadlocks ""against the scalp or free-hanging"" are banned. ""Unkempt"" or ""matted"" braids and cornrows are also considered dreadlocks and ""are not authorized,"" according to the regulations that were updated this month. It's that type of language, words like ""unkempt"" and ""matted,"" that read to some African Americans, as code for racial bias. ""These new changes are racially biased and the lack of regard for ethnic hair is apparent,"" Sgt. Jasmine Jacobs of the Georgia National Guard wrote in a White House petition she started in late March asking the Obama administration to reconsider the policy. Currently, the petition has more than 13,000 signatures. White House petition . ""We feel let down,"" Jacobs told the Army Times. ""I think, at the end of the day, a lot of people don't understand the complexities of natural hair. A lot of people, instead of educating themselves, they think dreadlocks and they think Bob Marley, or they see women with really big Afros and they think that's the only thing we can do with our hair."" The updates in appearance standards were crafted, in part, with the help of African-American female soldiers and are intended to clarify the professional look of soldiers, said Troy Rolan, an Army spokesman. Previous regulations did not specifically address things such as braid widths or numbers, or the definition of twist styles. ""Many hairstyles are acceptable, as long as they are neat and conservative,"" Rolan said, noting the Army has banned dreadlocks since 2005. If soldiers aren't happy, they can go through a formal process to request changes to the hairstyle regulations, the Army said. ""We encourage soldiers to make use of this process by sending recommendations and examples of hairstyles which could present professional appearances and conform to the regulation,"" Rolan said. The rules' conciseness isn't the problem, say some African-American women and black studies scholars. The problem, they say, is a perception that ethnic hair that is ""natural"" or not straightened with heat or chemicals is somehow unruly, unkempt and must be carefully regulated to fit within white cultural norms. Black female soldiers say new grooming reg is 'racially biased' ""In a broad sense, it's just another example of U.S. institutions policing black style,"" said Mark Anthony Neal, an African-American studies professor at Duke University. ""And it's not that there aren't other examples of such policing among other racial and ethnic groups. But, given the fraught relationship between black identity and culture and what some Americans might perceive as 'normal,' it strikes a particularly dissonant chord among some blacks."" Mandating what should be done with black hair is a particularly sensitive matter. During slavery and for generations after, hair texture, along with skin complexion, was used to classify which slaves were more valuable, given jobs in the master's house rather than the field, and — by default — deemed beautiful. Straighter hair, lighter skin and features that looked white were considered preferred traits, African-American scholars noted. Those values were internalized and perpetuated within the black community for years in a way that was particularly damaging to the self-esteem of black women, African American scholars said. ""The gender dynamic here is also important; hair is so tied to the idea of black womanhood and self-esteem,"" Neal said. ""There have been many stories, for example, of the extra scrutiny black women with locs or dreads face going through airport security. The Army's ban is just another knock from the dominant society that somehow black women are out of step with the so-called status quo."" Black pride and natural hair movements have emphasized that all hair types and the rainbow of skin hues are all beautiful. However, the Army's regulations, some natural hair advocates and African American scholars fear, might suggest to black soldiers that their tresses must be straightened or closely cropped in order to fit in and be valued. Army: Female focus group helped determine new hair rules . That type of pressure is ""both unfair and racially biased,"" said Imani Perry, an African-American studies professor at Princeton University. ""While it is reasonable for the military to expect some degree of conformity and neatness in hairstyles, those expectations ought to take into account the variety of natural hair textures people have,"" Perry said. ""For many African-American women who have tightly curled, coily or kinky hair, cornrows braids and locs are styles that allow for ease of close to the head grooming. Hence, banning those hairstyles puts black female soldiers in a difficult bind with respect to the requirement."" That type of pressure is ""both unfair and racially biased,"" Perry said adding that the Army conformity isn't absolute because female soldiers are allowed to wear their hair long. ""Likewise, consideration ought to be made for different textures of hair,"" Perry said. ""Otherwise, a burden is placed disproportionately upon some soldiers due to an immutable characteristic, natural hair texture that is tied to race.""","Army's updated appearance guidelines ban many African-American hairstyles .

"Novak Djokovic ended one of the most remarkable winning streaks in sport after taking Rafael Nadal's Monte Carlo Masters crown on Sunday. Nadal had been seeking to win the clay tournament for the ninth successive year, but fell to his first defeat in the principality since 2003 as the Serbian underlined his status as the world's top tennis player with a 6-2 7-6 (7-1) victory in one hour 52 minutes. It halted Nadal's 46-match winning run, and was the Spaniard's second defeat in five finals since making his comeback from knee injury in Chile in February. ""It's such a great pleasure to win here, it's very special,"" said Djokovic, who lives in Monte Carlo. ""Rafa, thanks for  allowing me to win here at least once. I can't ask for a better start to the clay season."" Nadal, who had been sidelined for seven months, has now lost six of his 44 clay finals -- three of them to Djokovic, who will be hoping to stop the 11-time grand slam champion defending his French Open title when the season's second major starts at the end of next month. The 25-year-old now has a 15-19 record against Nadal, whose last defeat on clay during the month of April was back in 2005. ""What Novak is doing is just amazing,"" said Nadal, known as the ""King of Clay."" ""Congratulations for winning my favorite event and all the best for the  rest of your season. ""Last year was especially hard for me, but I had the support of my team and  my fans. That was a very positive energy for me and gave me motivation to play  here again."" Djokovic has also overcome recent injury problems, having been a doubt for Monte Carlo after hurting his ankle on Davis Cup duty. ""If somebody told me 10 days ago I'd be winning the trophy, I wouldn't  think it's so realistic, to be honest,"" he said. ""I went through pain, I went through a big challenge, mentally, physically,  emotionally, and in the end it was getting better as the tournament was going  on."" Sunday's final was delayed by almost 45 minutes due to rain, but when play finally got under way it was Djokovic who took charge, losing just 12 points in the first five games and then wrapping up the set when Nadal double-faulted. The second set was a lot tighter, and featured four breaks of serve, but Djokovic retained his composure to comfortably win the tie-break and earn the 37th title of his career and his 14th at Masters level -- eight behind Nadal's leading 22. Djokovic had been beaten by the 26-year-old Nadal in the 2009 and 2012 finals in Monte Carlo. Last year he lost in straight sets just days after the death of his grandfather. Meanwhile, Russia booked a place in the final of the women's Fed Cup competition after overturning a 2-0 deficit against Slovakia in Moscow on Sunday -- becoming the first team to ever do so. Ekaterina Makarova and Elena Vesnina won the deciding doubles rubber, beating Dominika Cibulkova and Daniela  Hantuchova 4-6 6-3 6-1 in two and a half hours. Maria Kirilenko had earlier kept Russia in the semifinal, winning 7-5 6-1 against Cibulkova before . Makarova leveled the scores with a  6-3 4-6 6-4 win over Hantuchova. The Russians, seeking a fifth title, will play Italy in November's final following Monday's completion of the delayed second semi. The Czech Republic, seeking a third consecutive title, lost 3-1 in Palermo as Roberta Vinci clinched the decisive point with a 6-3 6-7 (2-7) 6-3 win over Lucie Safarova. ""This is an incredible moment, an incredible victory,"" Vinci said. ""The crowd was really important today. But now we're in the Fed Cup final again, so I'm really happy. ""I think this is the best time in my tennis career."" Italy won the title in 2009-10, and also in 2006, but lost to the Czechs in last year's semifinals. In another match delayed by weather, Australia won through to the World Group playoffs by beating Switzerland 3-1 on Monday, joining Germany, Spain and the United States.","World No. 1 Novak Djokovic wins the Monte Carlo Masters for the first time .

"The devastating attack on the Grand Mosque in Kano, Nigeria, on Friday was almost certainly the work of Boko Haram, which has stepped up its bombing campaign across northern Nigeria in recent weeks. It may seem counterintuitive that Islamist militants should attack a mosque, but since its early days, Boko Haram has targeted the Muslim ""establishment"" in Nigeria, accusing it of not defending the interests of Nigeria's 80 million Muslims, of corruption and of ""perverting"" Islam. One eminent member of that establishment is the emir of Kano, Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, a former governor of Nigeria's Central Bank who frequently preaches at the Kano mosque on Fridays. The emir of Kano is the second-most influential Muslim figure in Nigeria. Sanusi was reportedly out of the country at the time of Friday's attack -- but two weeks ago, he used Friday prayers to urge Nigerians to defend themselves against Boko Haram. ""People must stand resolute"" against a group that enslaves girls and ""must not assume that the crisis will not reach their area,"" Sanusi said. The Kano attack, which killed dozens of worshipers and injured scores more, is not the first aimed at a mosque or at an emir. Last year, at least 40 worshippers were shot dead at a mosque in Borno state, where Boko Haram is strongest. The group has also assassinated senior Muslim political and religious figures in northern Nigeria. And it has specifically targeted anyone calling for or organizing self-defense units, known as the Civilian Joint Task Force. Sanusi's predecessor, Emir Al Haji Ado Bayero, was the target of an assassination attempt in February 2013. His driver and bodyguards were killed. Bayero died this year, at the age of 83. Boko Haram has stepped up suicide bombings, causing mass casualties in several northern states. Just this week, two female suicide bombers attacked a busy market in the city of Maiduguri, killing 21 people. And the bombing of a bus station near Mubi in Ademawa state killed 40 people. Boko Haram claimed to have taken control of Mubi, a town of 200,000 people, at the end of October -- a sign of its commitment to build an area in northern Nigeria ruled by Islamic law -- in addition to carrying out terror attacks. The Nigerian army, supported by civilian vigilantes, was able to expel Boko Haram from Mubi two weeks later, but the group still controls several towns across northeastern Nigeria, including Gwoza, a town of nearly 300,000 in Borno state. According to Boko Haram's mysterious leader, Abubakar Shekau, Gwoza was evidence of the group's growing ambitions in northern Nigeria. ""Thanks be to Allah, who gave victory to our brethren in Gwoza and made it a state among Islamic states,"" he said in August. Virginia Comolli, research fellow for security and development at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the Nigerian military faces multiple problems. It has been plagued by indiscipline, desertion and mutinies, with some commanders attacked by their own men. It has developed a well-documented reputation for human rights abuses, alienating many of the people it is meant to protect. Additionally, a lack of support has left many units exposed in the vast rural hinterland of the north, where Boko Haram has shown it can operate simultaneously on several fronts. Last week, for example, its fighters ambushed and killed nearly 50 fish-sellers close to Lake Chad, nearly 400 miles from Kano, despite the nearby presence of a multinational border force. A state of emergency in parts of northern Nigeria has had little impact on Boko Haram, and despite intense international attention, the Nigerian military has been unable to rescue any of more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped this year. The group's resumption of a campaign of suicide bombings is probably aimed at humiliating the government of President Goodluck Jonathan, who recently declared he would run for re-election in February. Besides its ideological aversion to democracy, which it sees as inimical to Islam, Boko Haram despises Jonathan as a southern Christian and wants to make the north ungovernable. Comolli says one of its aims is to ensure that February's election cannot be held in the three northern states where emergencies have been declared. Attacking Kano, the biggest city in the north and a trade hub, is part of that strategy. (The state of Kano is one of the two most populous in Nigeria.) In an effort to win more international support, Nigerian officials have likened Boko Haram to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Nigeria's ambassador in Washington, Adebowale Ibidapo Adefuye, said this month, ""There is no use giving us the type of support that enables us to deliver light jabs to the terrorists when what we need to give them is the killer punch."" Dismissing claims that the army was responsible for human rights abuses as rumor and hearsay, Adeyufe said the United States needed to do more to help a partner in the battle against terrorism. ""We find it difficult to understand how and why, in spite of the U.S. presence in Nigeria with their sophisticated military technology, Boko Haram should be expanding and becoming more deadly,'' he told an audience at the Council on Foreign Relations. Despite providing technical assistance in the hunt for the missing schoolgirls, the Obama administration appears wary of engagement with a military that has such a flawed reputation. There is evidence that Boko Haram has links with other jihadist groups. Some of its fighters spent time in Mali alongside a faction of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb in early 2012, when much of that country fell under that group's sway for several months. Its rapid assimilation of bomb-making expertise and the use of kidnapping for ransom also suggests contacts  with al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, says Comolli. But she believes that as AQIM has come under pressure following the French intervention in Mali, it has become less able to provide training or other help to Boko Haram. For now, Boko Haram remains a very much Nigerian phenomenon focused on causing mayhem at home. And it is the civilians -- in their many thousands -- who bear the brunt of its attacks.","Since its early days Boko Haram has targeted the Muslim ""establishment"" in Nigeria .

"(CNN) -- The Ebola epidemic now raging across three countries in West Africa is three-fold larger than any other outbreak ever recorded for this terrible disease; the only one to have occurred in urban areas and to cross national borders; and officially urgent and serious. At least 1,090 people have contracted the awful disease this year, though the epidemic's true scope is unknown because of widespread opposition to health authorities in afflicted Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. This week, 39-year-old physician Sheik Umar Khan -- labeled the country's hero for his brave leadership of the epidemic fight -- died from Ebola, adding yet another public fear: that even the doctors cannot escape the disease. But as terrifying as Ebola is, the virus has been controlled in the past, and can be again. The current crisis, which threatens an 11-nation region of Africa that includes the continent's giant, Nigeria, is not a biological or medical one so much as it is political. The three nations in Ebola's thrall need technical support from outsiders but will not succeed in stopping the virus until each nation's leaders embrace effective governance. As was the case in Kikwit, Zaire, in 1995 -- an Ebola outbreak I personally was in as a journalist -- there is no vaccine or cure for the disease. The key to stopping its spread is rapid identification of the sick; removal of the ailing and deceased from their homes; and quarantine and high hygiene measures to prevent transmission of the virus to family members and health care workers. In the absence of such measures, Ebola will kill upwards of 70% of those it infects, as the virus punches holes in veins, causing massive internal hemorrhaging and bleeding from the eyes, ears, mouth and all other orifices. Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone are among the poorest, least governed states in the world. About half of the nations' adults are illiterate. The 11.75 million people of Guinea have a per capita annual income of merely $527, and their combined male/female life expectancy is 58 years. In 2011, the government of President Alpha Conde spent $7 on average per capita on health. Life is no better for the 4.2 million people living in neighboring Liberia, where per capita income is $454, life expectancy is 62 years and the government of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf spends $18 per capita on health. In Sierra Leone, the 6 million residents have a per capita income of $809 per year, life expectancy is merely 46 years, and the government of the President, Dr. Ernest Bai Koroma, spent $13 per capita last year on health. Since Ebola first broke out in March in Guinea, fear has gripped the region, coupled with suspicion and wild rumors. Some have proclaimed the epidemic ""divine retribution"" for past sins. In April, Guinean health officials failed to quarantine an Ebola patient who reportedly spread the virus from a remote area to the capital -- a lapse that undermined government credibility. In April, a mob claiming that foreigners were spreading diseases attacked a Doctors Without Borders clinic in rural Guinea and forced the Nobel Peace Prize-winning group to abandon its mission. The charity returned only after it had negotiated its safety with local religious leaders. In the capital city of Conakry, families have been hiding their ailing relatives. Even the local Red Cross was forced to abandon a part of the country after men brandishing knives surrounded them. And in one district, police fired tear gas at a mob that was trying to raid the morgue in order to give their loved ones proper burials, despite the risk of contagion. As the epidemic spread to Sierra Leone in May, brought in by a traditional healer who tended to ailing Guineans and then returned home, similar problems surfaced. Family members defied a local quarantine, thereby spreading infection. By the end of May, authorities were losing track of Ebola sufferers amid widespread fleeing from health facilities; the toll of missing patients approached 60 by June. Some local leaders spread rumors that ""the white people"" were conducting experiments, infecting Sierra Leonians or cutting off people's limbs. Doctors Without Borders warned that widespread belief that Ebola does not exist threatened to spread the disease regionally. Today the word ""Ebola"" carries so much stigma that few ailing individuals even seek diagnosis. By the end of June, the epidemic was exploding in Liberia, fueled by the same sorts of denial and wild rumors that were rampant in Sierra Leone and Guinea. In one county, men with weapons chased off government health workers. Today, the World Health Organization is officially loath to say so, but under these circumstances, this epidemic is beyond anybody's control. Nobody, in any culture, relishes having their ailing loved ones removed from a family's care, or their bodies hauled off to ignominious mass graves. But the violent reaction to such measures in West Africa is far more extreme than anything that has occurred in other Ebola crises since the virus's first appearance in Zaire in 1976. This should come as no surprise to anybody with a modicum of knowledge of recent history. The nations of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone have a shared, brutal history of civil wars that since 1989 have left more than 400,000 people dead, displaced half a million people from their traditional homes, seen rape used as a weapon against tens of thousands of girls and women, and put Liberia's former President behind bars as a war criminal. One of the most heinous features of the 1989-to-2005 wars was public amputation, typically carried out by child soldiers. The violence began in 1980 when Samuel Doe killed President William Tolbert and then tyrannized Liberia for a decade, growing rich off its diamond trade. In 1990, rebels invaded the country from Ivory Coast, captured Doe, tortured him, dragged him naked through the streets of Monrovia, and then executed him. Charles Taylor took over the nation, running it until 2003. Taylor, in turn, helped his comrade Foday Sankoh seize control of Sierra Leone, and they systematically exploited their nations' mines, leading to the United Nations term ""blood diamonds."" What you need to know about the deadliest ever outbreak . With help from Guinea, a second civil war started in 1999 in Liberia, eventually engaging multiple warring factions, each more brutal than the other. It spilled over into Sierra Leone and was egged on by military elements in Nigeria. By 2000, all three of the now-Ebola-torn countries were embroiled. Taylor fled into exile in Nigeria in 2003, and both he and Sankoh faced U.N. war crimes trials. Sankoh died of a heart attack before his trial; Taylor is now imprisoned. In these three nations, few families have not experienced murders, rapes, torture, maiming, loss of homes and death. Fear, suspicion, poverty, pain and superstition are the norm, the noise that everybody lives with, every minute of their lives. Ebola is simply a new scream heard above that terrible background din. The challenge today in these barely functioning states is to find ways to lower the overall noise, focus on stopping the Ebola virus, and bring governance and peace to three countries that have rarely experienced either.","Laurie Garrett: Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia worst ever, could be controlled .

"""It's an absolute disgrace."" Maureen Faulkner learned Tuesday that her husband's convicted killer was selected as the commencement speaker for a graduating class at the Goddard College in Vermont. Thirty-two years ago Mumia Abu-Jamal, born Wesley Cook, was convicted of shooting and killing Faulkner's husband, Daniel Faulkner, a five-year veteran with the Philadelphia Police Department. ""It's a disgrace that you have to even hear his voice. My husband has been dead for 32 years and his voice was taken from him by Abu-Jamal,"" Faulkner told CNN in a phone interview. Since his trial, conviction and imprisonment, Abu-Jamal, now 60, has been a divisive figure. He had made a reputation in Philadelphia as an outspoken radical and radio journalist before Faulkner's killing in December 1981. He was originally sentenced to death, but the sentence was commuted to life without parole. Abu-Jamal has maintained his innocence throughout his incarceration and multiple appeals for a new trial, all of which have been denied. Supporters and activists have claimed he is a political prisoner. Human rights groups have questioned whether he received a fair trial. Abu-Jamal resides at Mahanoy state prison in Frackville, Pennsylvania, where he is a correspondent for PrisonRadio.org, which can be heard in more than 100 radio stations each week. He has written seven books and numerous essays, and has been the subject of films and documentaries. This is the second speech Abu-Jamal has given for Goddard students. The first was in 2008. He also recorded commencement speeches for Evergreen State College in Washington state in 1999 and for Antioch College in Ohio in 2000. Goddard spokesperson Samantha Kolber told CNN, ""We spoke with Mrs. Faulkner and expressed our deep sympathies, and while he felt for her loss we also felt the students had the freedom to listen to Mumia."" Abu-Jamal's commencement speech was recorded via telephone from prison by PrisonRadio.org director Noelle Hanrahan. ""He called in to our studio,"" Hanrahan told CNN. ""We will release it after the students hear it. It's a reflection of his experience on campus at Goddard. He went to Goddard in the late '70s as an undergraduate. He talks about being able to experience an intellectual life."" Pennsylvania Department of Corrections policy allows general population inmates, such as Abu-Jamal, to make phone calls to an approved phone list. And as long as he is not breaking any rules, there is nothing corrections officers can do. ""We have tried to intervene but we have been told by the court that we can't,"" said the Department of Corrections press secretary, Susan McNaughton. ""We are disappointed that a college would choose to have a convicted murderer, especially a cop killer, be their commencement speaker,"" McNaughton said. Goddard is a small liberal arts college of about 600 students. The median student age is 35 years old. A graduating class of 23 students met with their faculty adviser and a professor, and chose Abu-Jamal as their speaker. ""He is a warm, gracious guy who is very articulate and on top of issues,"" said Hanrahan. ""They are adults making their own decisions,"" said Kolber. She quoted from what she said was an email from a student, saying Abu-Jamal's case ""'has been rooted in the struggles for freedom of mind, body, and spirit...' which are values that are important to these graduates."" For Faulkner, this is a ""tragedy."" ""He (Abu-Jamal) is a despicable, callous, dangerous man and people try to put him on a pedestal and make him into something he is not,"" said Faulkner. ""What can Abu-Jamal offer anyone after he so violently took my husband's life?"" The college defended the student's decision in a statement of support sent to CNN. ""Every individual has an inherent worth and dignity and deserves to have their perspective heard even if it is unpopular,"" it read. ""There is academic merit in what Mumia has to say and it is important that we at Goddard College support our students' right to choose and freedom of speech."" But Faulkner believes Abu-Jamal lost his freedom when he killed her husband. ""He stepped out of society when he put a bullet between my husband's eyes. Just as he took my husband's freedom and life, he lost his rights. Why does he have constitutional rights? My husband doesn't have any. He is 6 feet underground,"" said Faulkner. Abu-Jamal's speech is expected to be heard Saturday. The recorded remarks will be played alongside a short documentary on his life.","Mumia Abu-Jamal recorded the speech via phone from jail .

"The Keystone XL pipeline represents a big step toward true North American energy independence, reducing our reliance on Middle Eastern oil and increasing our access to energy from our own nation and our closest ally, Canada, along with some oil from Mexico -- to 75% of our daily consumption, compared with 70% now. That decades-long goal for our country is finally within reach, but we need to stay focused on the big picture, and we need to act. This $7 billion, 1,700-mile, high-tech transcontinental pipeline is a big-time, private-sector job creator, and it will also hold down the gas prices for consumers and reduce our energy dependence on an unstable part of the world. Finally, it will do so with good environmental stewardship. That's why I, along with 44 of my colleagues from across the nation, introduced new legislation to move the project toward approval and construction after President Barack Obama's rejection of the project last month. Another view: Ted Turner on the case against the Keystone XL pipeline . The Hoeven-Lugar-Vitter amendment to the highway funding bill, which we are now working to pass, authorizes TransCanada to construct and operate the Keystone XL pipeline from Alberta, Canada, to the Midwest and Gulf Coast, transporting an additional 830,000 barrels of oil per day to U.S. refineries. This includes 100,000 barrels of crude oil a day from the Bakken region of North Dakota and Montana. That's key to my state, because providing pipeline capacity and gathering systems for that much North Dakota crude will take as many as 500 trucks a day off of roads in the oil patch. That's a win-win for producers, state revenues and most importantly, public safety on our Western highways. The Keystone XL project is good for North Dakota, but it is vital for the nation. Some 75% of the pipe for the Keystone XL pipeline will be made here in North America, 50% of it in Arkansas. Some 90% of all other construction materials will come from companies in the United States and Canada. From an environmental perspective, the project has been under review since September 2008, more than three years, and the State Department's environmental review, completed in August 2011, found ""no significant impacts on most resources"" providing environmental restrictions are met. Further, our new legislation includes all federal and state safeguards and sets no time limit on Nebraska's ability to further review the pipeline's route through the state, the only portion of the route in contention. Additionally, 80% of the new Canadian oil sands development is being developed ""in situ,"" meaning, it has a similar carbon footprint and emissions as conventional oil wells. If the Keystone XL pipeline isn't built, Canadian oil will still be produced -- 700,000 barrels a day of it -- but instead of coming down to our refineries in the United States, instead of creating jobs for American workers, instead of reducing our dependence on a turbulent part of the world, that oil will be shipped to China. It will have to be carried there on large oil tankers, creating more carbon emissions, and it will be processed at facilities with weaker environmental safeguards. Finally, it's important to point out that the Keystone XL pipeline is nothing new. Thousands of pipelines crisscross our nation, delivering refined products to fuel our cars, heat our homes and power our industries. In fact, the original Keystone pipeline, which became operational in 2010, runs from Alberta through my state of North Dakota. Contrary to claims by critics, the pipeline itself has never leaked. The leaks happened at fittings and seals at above-ground pumping stations, which were properly and promptly fixed. I have worked toward approval of the Keystone XL pipeline, first as governor of North Dakota and now as a U.S. senator, because I believe it helps our nation on so many levels. It is just the kind of project that will grow our economy and create jobs in the right way -- through private-sector investment. The Keystone XL pipeline will also help to wean us from our dependency on oil from volatile regions of the world and help us move toward a true energy independent future. It will make our nation safer and stronger for the American people. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter .

"With more planes searching than ever before, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott on Sunday expressed optimism the mystery of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 will be solved. ""We have now had a number of very credible leads, and there is increasing hope -- no more than hope, no more than hope -- that we might be on the road to discovering what did happen to this ill-fated aircraft,"" Abbott said. He spoke at a press conference about objects that have been spotted by satellites about 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) off Perth. In one of the great aviation mysteries in history, the airliner carrying 239 people disappeared March 8 after it took off from Kuala Lumpur on a flight to Beijing, CHina. Malaysian investigators believe it was deliberately diverted by someone on board. ""Obviously, the more aircraft we have, the more ships we have, the more confident we are of recovering whatever material is down there,"" Abbott said. ""And obviously before we can be too specific about what it might be, we do actually need to recover some of this material."" The international search for the missing aircraft resumed early Sunday near Perth, with a U.S. Navy P-8 Poseidon rejoining the effort, according to a naval spokesman. Eight planes will search over the Indian Ocean on Sunday, compared to six planes on Saturday, said Andrea Hayward-Maher, spokeswoman for the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. She said that would be the most planes yet. Planes from the United States, New Zealand, Australia and China will be flying. Three planes, two civilian aircraft  and the P-8, were airborne by 7 a.m. Perth time (7 p.m. ET). New Chinese satellite images ""will be taken into consideration"" in the search,  Hayward-Maher said. The P-8 Posideon, grounded for two days to give its crew rest, will likely refocus on an area highlighted in Chinese satellite images of a large object floating in the area. Australian-led search teams in the southern Indian Ocean found no sign of it Saturday. The intense air and sea search -- which will now employ NASA satellites -- entered its third week with no new clues to give families answers about the fate of the passengers and crew. The object the Chinese photographed is 22.5 meters long and 13 meters wide (74 feet by 43 feet), officials said. China said the satellite images showing the ""suspected floating object"" were captured on March 18. As a result of the recently reported satellite sighting approximately 1,500 miles off the coast of Perth, plans are underway to acquire imagery within the next few days, NASA said Saturday. The space agency said it will check archives of satellite data and use space-based assets such as the Earth-Observing-1 (EO-1) satellite and the ISERV camera on the International Space Station to acquire images of possible crash sites. The resolution of these images could be used to identify objects of about 98 feet (30 meters) or larger. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority said searchers will take the Chinese information into consideration as they design their search for Sunday. The floating object was about 77 miles from where earlier satellite images spotted floating debris. At least six search flights were involved Saturday, including two private jets. Though the two civilian jets did not have radar, their role was crucial, authorities said. ""It is more likely that a pair of eyes are going to identify something floating in the ocean,"" Australian Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said. Indeed, during Saturday's search it was a civil aircraft that reported sighting some small objects floating with the naked eye, including a wooden pallet, AMSA said. These objects were within a radius of 5 kilometers (3 miles). A Royal New Zealand Air Force P-3 Orion was dispatched to the area, but only reported seeing clumps of seaweed, AMSA said. On Saturday, the Norwegian merchant ship Hoegh St. Petersburg was released from taking part in the search, according to AMSA. Australian officials thanked the ship's crew for its ""valuable assistance and efforts,"" AMSA said via Twitter. Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 vanished on March 8 with 239 people aboard destined for Beijing from Kuala Lumpur. The stated goal of the Malaysian authorities is to narrow the search area, a task that is proving difficult. Intensified, expanded search . The search area expanded sizably on Saturday compared to the previous day, thanks in part to the capabilities of the civil jets. ""Operations continue, and today they plan to search an area of approximately 10,500 square nautical miles,"" Hishammuddin said Saturday. In addition to two Chinese planes that arrived in Australia,  Beijing is sending two more ships to join five already in the southern corridor. ""Two Indian aircraft, a P-8 Poseidon and a C-130 Hercules, arrived in Malaysia last night to assist with the search,"" he said. Seven countries -- China, India, Pakistan, Myanmar, Laos, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan -- informed investigators that based on preliminary information, their nations had no radar sightings of missing jetliner. Clues, but no proof . An exhaustive search covering 2.97 million square miles --  nearly the size of the continental United States -- has yielded some clues, but no proof of where the Boeing 777 is or what happened to it. One of the most notable leads revolved around two large objects detected by satellite a week ago floating on waters over 1,400 miles off Australia's west coast. ""The fact that it's six days ago that this imagery was captured does mean that clearly what objects were there, are likely to have moved a significant different distance as a result of currents and winds,"" Truss said. ""It's also possible that they've just drifted to the bottom of the ocean bed, and the ocean in this area is between 3 and 5 kilometers deep. So it's a very, very deep part of the ocean, very remote. And all that makes it particularly difficult."" Debris is a common sight in the waters in that part of the ocean, he said, and includes containers that fall off ships. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott on Friday defended the decision to announce the find, saying Australia owes it to families of those missing ""to give them information as soon as it's to hand."" But he didn't make any promises. ""It could just be a container that has fallen off a ship,"" Abbott said during a visit to Papua New Guinea. ""We just don't know."" Malaysia's interim transportation minister tried to reset expectations for a quick resolution to the mystery after the satellite discovery. ""This is going to be a long haul,"" Hishammuddin Hussein said. Search intensifies . U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel ordered the Navy and policy experts to look at the availability and usefulness of U.S. military undersea technology to try to find the plane's wreckage and its data recorders, a U.S. military official said. The United States has spent $2.5 million so far on the entire effort, Pentagon spokesman Col. Steven Warren said Friday. First lady Michelle Obama, while on a trip to Beijing, said the United States is keeping the families of the missing passengers in its thoughts. ""As my husband has said, (the) United States (is) offering as many resources as possible to assist in the search,"" she said. Global search . Countries from central Asia to Australia are also engaged in the search along an arc drawn by authorities based on satellite pings received from the plane hours after it vanished. One arc tracks the southern Indian Ocean zone that's the focus of current attention. ""We intend to continue the search until we are absolutely satisfied that further searching would be futile, and that day is not in sight,"" the deputy prime minister said. ""We will continue the effort, we'll continue to liaise with our international allies in this search."" The other tracks over parts of Cambodia, Laos, China and into Kazakhstan. Malaysian authorities were awaiting permission from Kazakhstan's government to use the country as a staging area for the northern corridor search, Hishammuddin said. Malaysia Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari  Yahya  told reporters Saturday that a transcript obtained by The Telegraph newspaper is ""inaccurate,"" but did not provide additional details. The Telegraph reported Friday it had a transcript documenting 54 minutes of back-and-forth between the cockpit and ground control from taxiing in Kuala Lumpur to the final message of ""All right, good night."" Unexplained element . The alleged transcript reported by The Telegraph contains seemingly routine conversations about which runway to use and what altitude to fly at. One unexplained element, according to the British newspaper, is a call, in which someone in the cockpit stated that the aircraft was at a cruising altitude of 35,000 feet -- something that had been done just six minutes earlier. Twelve minutes after that comes the ""good night"" message, at around the time Flight 370 was being transferred to Vietnam's control. Another wrinkle:  Malaysia Airlines chief executive officer Ahmad Jauhari  Yahya said the plane was carrying a cargo of lithium-ion batteries, although he didn't specify the volume of the shipment. Lithium-ion batteries are commonly used in laptops and cell phones, and have been known to explode, although that occurs rarely. They were implicated in the fatal crash of a UPS cargo plane in Dubai in 2010, and lithium-ion batteries used to power components on Boeing 787s were blamed for fires in those planes. There's no evidence the batteries played a role in the plane's disappearance, and Ahmad said they are routine cargo aboard aircraft.

"London (CNN) -- For a second consecutive year, no leader has been deemed worthy of the $5 million Ibrahim Prize for Achievement in African Leadership. The foundation's prize committee announced Monday that it had decided not to award the prize -- the fourth time there has been no winner in its seven-year history. Winners must be democratically-elected leaders who have stepped down in the past three years after serving their constitutionally mandated term, and have demonstrated ""excellence in office."" The committee's failure to again find a prize winner has led some to comment that its selection criteria are too narrow, and should be broadened to include those showing leadership in civil society. But Ibrahim, a Sudanese-born telecommunications businessman and billionaire, who created the foundation in 2006, defended the prize. ""Most African countries are new states -- some of the states did not exist 70 years, 50 years ago,"" he said, adding, ""In established democracies there are some kinds of checks and balances, but at the early stages in a state's formation the power of the president is huge ... And we need really to point the finger at where the responsibility lies. ""Let's put the light there and let us seek heroes."" Mo Ibrahim: Africa's elderly leaders risk more revolutions . The previous winners were President Pedro Verona Pires of Cape Verde in 2011, Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique in 2007 and Festus Mogae of Botswana in 2008. Nelson Mandela was made the honorary inaugural Laureate in 2007. In 2009 and 2010 there was no winner, but in 2012 the foundation awarded Archbishop Desmond Tutu a one-off $1 million special prize for his lifelong commitment towards ""speaking truth to power."" There have also been accusations that failing to find a prize winner can encourage negative stereotypes about Africa and its leaders. Hadeel Ibrahim, Mo's daughter and founding executive director of the foundation, told CNN: ""We're holding a mirror up to Africa and if there's a winner, congratulations to the winner and to that country, and if there's no winner we hope that African people get more of the leadership they deserve."" She added: ""I think that when there's no winner it means that there was no excellent individual. Some people have no expectations of a winner so it doesn't cast Africa in a negative light, because it's what they expect of the continent. For other people the fact that we've even had three winners has opened their eyes to the fact that leadership is much better than it was."" The foundation also released its Ibrahim Index of African Governance (IIAG) -- an annual study that uses 94 indicators to measure good governance in Africa. In the 2013 index Mauritius scored highest for governance, followed by Botswana and Cape Verde, while Somalia scored worst, followed by DR Congo and Eritrea. Liberia was judged to have improved most, while Madagascar deteriorated most. The report found that 46 African countries have seen improved governance since 2000, with those countries accounting for 94% of Africa's population. But the report also found that safety and the rule of law have deteriorated overall, with only 20 countries showing an improvement in this category since 2000, partly because of increased internal unrest and internal conflicts in the continent. Some felt the leadership prize, and its lack of a winner, detracted from impact of the governance report. At the report launch Mo Ibrahim referred to the African Union's summit last weekend, where the AU agreed to a resolution stating no sitting African head of state should appear before the International Criminal Court, amid accusations that the ICC was unfairly targeting Africa. ""We need an honest and good dialogue between the ICC and the African Union,"" he said. ""We cannot have a justice system that is in conflict with the continent, because it loses credibility.""","No winner of the 2013 Ibrahim Prize for Achievement in African Leadership .
