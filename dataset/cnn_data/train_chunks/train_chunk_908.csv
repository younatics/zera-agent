Spurs have won just four of their last 16 opening weekend fixtures in the Premier League (D4 L8). In fact, the Hammers beat Spurs three times in all competitions last seasons, winning the Capital One Cup quarter-final. These two sides faced each other on the opening day of the 1999/2000 season.

West Ham signing Enner Valencia scored three goals from five shots on target at the 2014 World Cup. Tottenham won 10 Premier League away games in 2013-14, only one team (Arsenal, 11) had recorded more (four other teams won 10).

"This, it has to be said, did not feel like the dawn of what Jose Mourinho has confidently predicted could be a decade of dominance for Chelsea. It felt like a pre-season friendly that even managed to undermine the name of the stadium that staged it. There wasn't much worth seeing at the Worthersee Stadion, even if it did end in a draw with a team that finished fifth in the Austrian Bundesliga last season. Mourinho blended a bit of experience with plenty of youth on Wednesday night and Chelsea's manager also took the opportunity to look at Filipe Luis for the first time. Starting spot: Filipe Luis (left) made his debut for Chelsea after his £16m move from Atletico Madrid . Making his mark: Felipe Luis made his first appearance for Chelsea in their 1-1 draw with RZ Pellets . In a battle: Branislav Ivanovic (left) tussles for the ball with Jacobo Ynclan during the 1-1 draw . Crunch: Roland Putsche tackles Chelsea's Lewis Baker during the first of the friendly game . Getting stuck in: Chelsea's Izzy Brown flies into a challenge with Dario Baldauf . Smart save: Pellets keeper Alexander Kofler denies Izzy Brown as Chelsea search for an equaliser . Signed from Atletico Madrid in the . summer, the full-back is clearly a player of pedigree despite having few . chances to prove it here. Kurt Zouma looks like he could be of some . value to Mourinho too. He might not be a regular starter this season but . the 19-year-old looked like something of a man mountain here in the . South Tyrol. An extremely useful understudy. In fairness to . Mourinho, it is some team he now appears to be building at Stamford . Bridge. Once he brings back more of the senior players and adds the . quality of Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas and Thibault Courtois, Chelsea . will boast a side capable of challenging for all the major honours this . coming campaign. The seemingly inevitable return of Didier Drogba - . although just as a player and not a player-coach, club officials insist - . will only add to their strength. This, however, felt like a nod . to the past and a look into the more distant future. A run out for some . of the kids and what could well be one of the last run outs for Petr . Cech in a Chelsea shirt if he is to lose his place to Courtois. It seems . unlikely Cech would accept sitting on the bench and is therefore sure . to take his considerable talents elsewhere. Bench boys (from left): Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas and Fernando Torres share a joke as they watch on . Get closer! Jose Mourinho vents his frustration at Chelsea's players as they struggle against RZ Pellets . Making his point: Jose Mourinho barks instructions to his Chelsea players during their game against Pellets . On Wednesday, Cech . nevertheless proved powerless to stop Silvio De Oliveira scoring for the . hosts in the 54th minute, the long-serving Chelsea goalkeeper diverting . the shot against the underside of his crossbar but only after the ball . had crossed the line. As television replays proved, it was an excellent . call by the match officials given the absence of goal line technology. Chelsea . created few opportunities of their own, their best in the first half . probably falling to Izzy Brown. The 17-year-old was left with only . Michael Sollbauer to beat but hit his shot straight at the keeper. But . to Mourinho's relief Jeremie Boga did rather better six minutes from . time, the quick, powerfully built young Frenchman holding off a couple . of strong challenges to win the pursuit of a Branislav Ivanovic ball . before scoring with a coolly taken finish. Afterwards Boga said: 'It was pretty physical because they've started the season already so we had to work even harder. Today I think I was good and I got a goal. I started near the half time and played a good one-two with Iva (Branislav Ivanovic) and it's a decent finish.' Cech added: 'To play 90 minutes for the first time is demanding but I've been working hard towards fitness. The shoulder is good - if we didn't know that I'm safe to play I wouldn't but we made the decision to go ahead.'

"FIFA has rejected calls to move the 2018 World Cup from Russia, saying the tournament 'can achieve positive change.' Russia's alleged involvement in shooting down a Malaysia Airlines plane over Ukraine last week prompted calls from some lawmakers in Germany to review the country's hosting rights. On Friday, FIFA issued a statement saying it 'deplores any form of violence' and would support only peaceful, democratic debate about the World Cup. 'Force for good': Sepp Blatter and Vladimir Putin pose for snaps at the World cup handover ceremony . 'History has shown so far that boycotting sport events or a policy of isolation or confrontation are not the most effective ways to solve problems,' FIFA said, adding that global attention on the World Cup 'can be a powerful catalyst for constructive dialogue between people and governments.' The conflict between Ukraine and pro-Russia separatist rebels escalated days after the World Cup ended in Brazil. On July 13 in Rio de Janeiro, Russian President Vladimir Putin attended a World Cup hosting handover ceremony with Brazilian counterpart Dilma Rousseff. Both then sat next to FIFA President Sepp Blatter to watch the final at the Maracana Stadium, won by Germany. FIFA, which has Russian sports minister Vitaly Mutko on its executive committee, said a World Cup in the country 'can be a force for good.' Looking forward: The Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow is set to host the 2018 World Cup Final . 'FIFA believes this will be the case for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia,' the governing body said. Blatter already rejected calls to strip Russia of the tournament after it annexed the Crimea this year. 'The World Cup has been given and voted to Russia and we are going forward with our work,' Blatter said in March. In a separate statement Friday, Mutko said a United States-led boycott of the 1980 Moscow Olympics had been a mistake. Constructor: Putin visiting the site of one of the new stadiums in the Volga River city of Samara . 'So there's no sense in reacting to politicians trying to make names for themselves,' Mutko was quoted saying by Russian news agency R-Sport. 'We're preparing in a calm way, building facilities, getting ready for the World Cup.' Russia has announced a $20 billion budget for building and renovating 12 stadiums, and other construction projects, for the first World Cup to be held in eastern Europe. 'FIFA has stated many times that sport should be outside politics,' Mutko said. 'Hosting an event like this, we're doing it for athletes from all over the world, for footballers, for the fans.'Â .

"By . Paul Hirst, Press Association . Manchester City will never be as popular as United because of the way they 'buy trophies' and 'shut the door' on youth players, according to Mikael Silvestre. The balance of power in Manchester shifted to City last season after they won the Barclays Premier League and finished some 22 points ahead of their local rivals. After spending hundreds of millions of pounds, City have won two league titles, an FA Cup and a League Cup since Sheikh Mansour took over in 2008. VIDEO Scroll down for Manuel Pellegrini: We may buy again to help with Champions League . Bought? Manchester City celebrating their Premier League triumph last season . Fallen: Whilst Manchester United struggled badly last season finishing seventh in the Premier League . Silvestre, who played for United for nine years, believes City's spending is bad for the game as it has stopped youth players being able to challenge for a place in the first-team. 'They just buy trophies,' Silvestre told Press Association Sport at an event organised by United's official time-keeper Bulova. 'United are all about growing players. City buy multiple stars and shut the door to the youth system. 'United have more courage. They are a club with a family spirit.Those who come through the ranks absorb the mentality, the history of the club so they show the heritage in their performances.' UEFA imposed a record 60million euro fine (£49million) on City after they broke Financial Fair Play rules last season. The club is growing in popularity across the globe, but Silvestre thinks they are still some way behind United. The former defender believes football fans across the globe have been put off supporting City because of their hefty spending. VIDEO Pellegrini calm over squad despite Negredo injury . Quiet: Man City's only major business of the summer so far has been the £12m signing of Fernando from Porto . Servant: Silvestre played for United for nine seasons between 1999-2008 . 'The way they do their business, it doesn't get people to support them,' Silvestre said. 'They might win trophies here and there but they won't gain support. I have been travelling a lot for United in the last six months. 'I have been to Asia, and the support there is unbelievable and honestly City is nowhere near that.' United and City will compete in the International Champions Cup in the United States over the next two weeks. Fans have been stationed outside United's hotel hoping to get a glimpse of their heroes ever since United landed in LA last Friday. Silvestre thinks that shows just how big the club are Stateside.

"By . Adam Crafton . Follow @@AdamCrafton_ . For the first time since the introduction of permanent shirt numbers, Manchester United find themselves without a number 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 15. This odd sequence has been brought about following a summer of departures, as Patrice Evra, Rio Ferdinand, Ryan Giggs and Nemanja Vidic have all called time on their glittering careers at Old Trafford. It only underlines the size of the reconstruction job that Louis van Gaal faces in the coming weeks as he attempts to rebuild his defence and add some stardust to the final third. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Luke Shaw on target during Manchester United training . Where are the stars? Manchester United's squad train in Los Angeles on Wednesday during their tour . Packed his bags: Patrice Evra . Retired: Ryan Giggs . Gone: Rio Ferdinand . Left for Italy: Nemanja Vidic . Last No 9: Dimitar Berbatov . No lucky seven: Antonio Valencia . Big job on his hands: Louis van Gaal (centre) jokes with Wayne Rooney at the Rose Bowl . With the start of the Premier League season just over three weeks away, Sportsmail assesses who is likely to be filling some of the most iconic shirt numbers in United’s history.... Fantastic talent: Luke Shaw, watched by Ryan Giggs . No 3 - LUKE SHAW . Following the exit of Evra, the £31million Luke Shaw is likely be offered the No 3 shirt and United hope that it will be his to wear for the next fifteen years. He has already impressed United’s coaching staff by returning to pre-season training one week early and he has also been given the seal of approval by United great Denis Irwin, who describes Shaw as ‘fantastic player with great pace’. Even before the departure of Evra to Juventus on Monday, Shaw had been told that he would be the club’s first-choice left back this season and it is a testament of United’s confidence in this 19-year-old that he may start the season as United’s only player in this position. Alex Buttner has also left for Dinamo Moscow, leaving Shaw unchallenged, but United are considering a move for another left-back, although Thomas Vermaelen, if he is signed, would offer cover in that position. No 5 - Mats Hummels/Thomas Vermaelen/Stefan De Vrij . Van Gaal has identified German World Cup winner Hummels as his prime defensive target but there is also a realistic recognition that it may be difficult to cut a deal with Dortmund this summer. The Dutchman also remains keen to sign Arsenal defender Vermaelen who, at 28, offers Premier League experience. The player is understood to have agreed a wage package in principle with United and he is hopeful of completing a move to the club this summer. Mats amazing: German World Cup winning defender Hummels, with his girlfriend Cathy Fischer . VIDEO United will continue to spend - Woodward . Only last week, Vermaelen was pictured holidaying with United forward Robin van Persie and the pair’s great friendship, forged at Arsenal, is believed be one factor that has persuaded the Belgian to push for the move. Arsene Wenger, however, is proving a troublesome stumbling block and even though the player’s contract is set to expire in 12 months time, the Arsenal boss is reluctant to allow another defender to leave following the exit of Bacary Sagna to Manchester City. If a replacement can be found - or if United offer a player as a makeweight - a deal should be done. Stefan de Vrij is also expected to arrive at Old Trafford and a deal worth £8.5m could be struck in the coming weeks. No 7 - Angel Di Maria/Memphis Depay/Adnan Januzaj . The iconic shirt worn with such distinction by David Beckham, Cristiano Ronaldo, Bryan Robson and George Best has now been vacant for 12 months after Antonio Valencia felt his performances were suffering due to the pressure of the responsibility and reverted to his favoured No 25. As things stand, United have prioritised reinforcing the defensive and midfield positions, although a move for Real Madrid’s Di Maria or PSV’s Depay is not out of the question. Up for grabs: Angel Di Maria looks set to leave Real Madrid after James Rodriguez's arrival at the Bernabeu . Many within the club are also keen for the honour to be handed to Januzaj, although his close relationship with Giggs could see him take the No 11 shirt. It may be a case of waiting until next summer when a star name can be brought in. Time to step up: United forward Danny Welbeck . No 9 - Danny Welbeck . The No 9 shirt has brought underwhelming stints from Louis Saha and Dimitar Berbatov in recent times after happier days with Andy Cole and Brian McClair. This shirt number has been absent since the departure of Berbatov in 2012 and with a striker unlikely to arrive this summer, United may feel that the time is right to promote England forward Welbeck from 19 to 9 as the Van Gaal era dawns at Old Trafford. No 11 - Adnan Januzaj . The shirt worn by Giggs for over twenty trophy-laden years now needs filling. Giggs himself does not want the shirt number retired, although it is believed to have been suggested as a tribute by some. United, however, are taking the view that they should produce one great player after another and that it should be seen as an honour to follow in Giggs' footsteps. Januzaj leaned heavily on the current assistant manager for advice last season and the two worked closely on the training ground. He is the one player at the club with the potential to step into the Welshman’s shoes. Wing wizard: Adnan Januzaj has the outrageous talent to follow in Giggs's footstepds . No 15 - Daley Blind . Blind was a star performer for Van Gaal at the World Cup with Holland and as the Dutchman prefers to operate with a smaller squad of around 22 or 23 players, the Ajax man’s versatility appeals greatly. Blind, who would cost around £14m, would offer cover for Luke Shaw at left back and also act as a useful stop-gap in central midfield as Michael Carrick recovers from injury. He has also earned a reputation as a big-match player, successfully carrying out a fierce man-marking job on Alexis Sanchez in Holland’s 2-0 win over Chile in Brazil.

Three months after travelling to Munich to watch Real Madrid play their Champions League semi-final second leg against Bayern Munich, James Rodriguez described his £60million move to the Spanish giants as a dream come true. In May, the Colombia international posed for a picture with Cristiano Ronaldo ahead of Madrid’s 4-0 win at the Allianz Arena, and then during the World Cup – where he won the Golden Boot with six goals in five games – the 23-year-old said: ‘It is a dream of mine to play in Spain, Madrid is my favourite team.’ ‘This is something I have always dreamed about,’ Rodriguez said in his first official interview since moving to Madrid. ‘I always wanted to join this club and I hope to be happy here for a long time to come and to help the club win a lot more titles.'

Despite the intimidation tactics Rodriguez still scored, a late penalty to make the score 2-1. 'Last month was incredible. I always wanted to come here and Madrid have shown an interest in me and have done everything so that I could be here. I am delighted because it is something I have always longed and wished for.' On his unveiling in front of thousands of fans at the Santiago Bernabeu, he said: 'It was very special. It is a day I will never forget. I will always hold onto that memory fondly. 'I felt really happy [hearing Madrid fans chant my name] because it is something I have always dreamed about. Ever since I was a boy I always wanted to be in this great stadium, an historic stadium. It was great and I hope that I play lots of matches here.' Back in May: Rodriguez met Ronaldo at the Allianz Arena and described hims as 'a genius' on Instagram . Wave: Rodriguez waves to the crowds as he becomes the fourth most expensive player in history . Rodriguez admitted that his whole family are fans of los Blancos. 'They have always supported the team and now even more,’ he said. ‘The whole of Colombia will be more into Real Madrid now, for sure. 'I admire Cristiano Ronaldo a lot, as I do the rest of the team. They are star names and to be by the side of these great players is an honour for me. ‘I hope to be able to win lots of titles with them, that is what we all want. 'I can provide goals, passes and good play. I am just one more player and I want to help out so that Madrid picks up wins and also titles.'

"By . Press Association Reporter . Celtic wide-man Derk Boerrigter faces a two-match ban after being issued with a notice of complaint by the Scottish FA's compliance officer for alleged diving. The Dutchman went to ground inside the box during the Scottish Premiership clash with St Johnstone at McDiarmid Park on Wednesday night as he was challenged by Dave Mackay. The Saints captain was sent off by referee John Beaton for denying an obvious goalscoring opportunity with Nir Biton scoring from the spot for the visitors' second goal in the 3-0 win.

Wrong decision: Mackay saw red during St Johnstone's 3-0 defeat against Celtic in the Scottish Premiership . Boerrigter allegedly breached rule 201, which is 'causing a match official to make an incorrect decision by committing an act of simulation' and has been offered a fixed two-match suspension. If he does not accept the charge and suspension he will face a disciplinary hearing on Thursday, August 21. Boerrigter has until Monday at 3pm to respond to the fixed suspension offer. St Johnstone appealed Mackay's red card and that will also be dealt with on August 21 by a tribunal. Celtic boss Ronny Deila vowed to speak with Boerrigter if he feels his player is a frequent diver. He said: 'I haven't seen it but as I said yesterday, there will be decisions for and against Celtic and over 38 games the best team will win. 'But I don't like diving. I don't want to cheat.

"By . Stephen Mcgowan . By time up the sighs of relief from the Celtic directors box very nearly drowned out the howls of outrage and anger from their St Johnstone counterparts. Almost, but not quite. Celtic will wake on Thursday morning to learn if Legia Warsaw have been judged to be the victims of an over-officious UEFA injustice. There was no right of appeal for St Johnstone on Wednesday night. No way of reversing the two significant penalty calls from referee John Beaton which saw Ronny Deila’s first competitive domestic game end in a comfortable victory. Breakthrough: Anthony Stokes rounds Mannus to give Celtic the lead at St Johnstone . St Johnstone (4-5-1): Mannus 5; Mackay 5,Croft 6, Anderson 5, Easton 6; Scobbie 6, Millar 6, McDonald 5 (Miller 78), O’Halloran 5 (Morgan 59), Caddis 5 (Wotherspoon 45); MacLean 5. Subs not used: Banks, Wright, Brown, Kane. Booked: Mackay, Wotherspoon. Sent off: Mackay. Celtic (4-4-2): Gordon 7; Matthews 6, Izaguirre 6, van Dijk 6, Lustig 6; Biton 6, Johansen 6; Forrest 7 (Boeriggter 57), McGregor 6; Commons 5 (Berget 67), Stokes 6 (Kayal 73). Subs not used: Zaluska, Ambrose, Pukki, Denayer. Booked: Johansen. Referee: John Beaton. Attendance: 6890. Man of the match: James Forrest . A week after finding himself in the eye of a storm for red carding Hibs player Danny Handling at Ibrox, Beaton was in the spotlight once more. If referees really are looking for a pay rise, this is the kind of game unlikely to help their cause much. It all hinged on six minutes and two key incidents involving Saints skipper Dave Mackay. The first saw the right-back race the length of the field to remonstrate after the raised boot of Virgil van Dijk appeared to make clear contact in the Celtic penalty area. No penalty, said the referee. On the touchline Tommy Wright writhed and gyrated, incensed with the verdict. His mood was scarcely aided by the spot kick given at the other end five minutes later. It was, in truth, a horrible decision. Derk Boeriggter hasn’t done much to enhance his reputation in Scottish football. His exaggerated tumble as he tried to wriggle clear of Mackay in the St Johnstone area is unlikely to improve the situation. Mackay – already booked – was shown an instant red card for an alleged infringement. Yet the Dutchman appeared to throw himself to the ground a full step after any semblance of contact, such as it was. The dismissal added insult to substantial injury. Already a goal down to an Anthony Stokes opportunist finish in 55 minutes, St Johnstone were done for. Controversy: Referee John Beaton shows a red card to St Johnstone's Dave Mackay (left) Nir Biton struck the penalty kick calmly into the net for his first Celtic goal. The third, a squirming low shot from Callum McGregor which wriggled horribly past Alan Mannus in 84 minutes, even though he got his hands to it, only compounded the St Johnstone anguish. The home support left at the end muttering their claims of Celtic cheating. The away support were diverted – however briefly – from their state of simmering discontent over Celtic’s transfer spend. Or lack of it. Seventy two hours before Fergus McCann unfurls the league flag there was a Bunnetesque sense of déjà vu as a banner in the Celtic support read: ‘Back the Team, sack the board.’ It was gone by time up. As was the Maribor assistant coach who travelled to Perth in expectation of hosting Celtic next Wednesday night. UEFA notwithstanding. His report will surely speak of a scoreline flattering the champions slightly. In truth Celtic rarely have it easy in Perth, winning just one of their last four visits on league business. Clinical: Nir Biton struck his penalty kick calmly into the net for his first Celtic goal . The injured Aleksandar Tonev was missing, while Manchester City’s on loan defender Jason Denayer started on the bench. The opening 45 minutes demonstrated why Ronny Deila’s next priority is to sign a striker. Leigh Griffiths – a player who might be the best option in the current impoverished circumstances – was axed from the squad completely. That, you sense, is a developing story. Stoke partnered Kris Commons up front once more in a conventional 4-4-2 – a departure from Deila’s preferred 4-2-3-1. Not for the first time the Irishman frustrated the life out of his supporters in the first half before delivering the goal which changed the game with an opportunist finish. The goal was well-timed. Without Stevie May, the talisman sold to Sheffield Wednesday, St Johnstone had their best spell at the start of the second half. The first period had been a non event. James Forrest had a bright 45 minutes on his first start for some time, but limped off in increasingly characteristic fashion in 57 minutes for Boeriggter, a critical change. Howler: St Johnstone keeper Alan Mannus (centre) fumbles a shot from Callum McGregor for third goal . Aside from Forrest, a competitive start for Craig Gordon marked the only other bright spot of the opening 45 for Deila. The former Scotland keeper might soon be the current Scotland No1 if he stays fit. Replacing Fraser Forster he looked assured and confident, producing the only save of note in a pretty dreadful opening period when he pushed away Steven MacLean’s 20 yard drive in the 22nd minute. Forrest was a bundle of energy, adding more balance and width to Celtic’s play. He played a terrific one-two with Commons in 15 minutes and cut inside before striking a disappointing left foot low drive. But Celtic’s next chance came a full 23 minutes later, Stokes fouled on the edge of the box by Mackay and striking the free kick narrowly wide himself. Within five minutes of the restart Saints came close to taking the lead when Michael O’Halloran retrieved Lee Croft’s inviting ball across goal and cut inside, his driven angled shot almost turned into goal by MacLean from close range. Delight: Celtic manager Ronny Deila salutes travelling fans after first league victory . Celtic, it seemed, were on the back foot. St Johnstone were knocking on the door. Yet that changed completely when Steven Anderson dallied in possession in his own final third and was dispossessed by a pressing Commons. Stokes collected, kept his cool and rounded Mannus to slot an angled low shot into the net for 1-0. McGregor almost added another seconds later, taking a ricocheted Emilio Izaguirre cross and thumping just wide. His moment would come. But only after the penalty incidents which defined this game. The Mackay claim after the raised boot by van Dijk. The Boeriggter flashpoint which left St Johnstone flushed and fuming. At 2-0 it wasn’t over yet. McGregor’s useful knack of scoring goals continued when his low shot at the end of a neat passing move slipped and squirmed and evaded Mannus for 3-0. The Celtic youngster could have had another moments later but the champions – and Deila – had the win they craved at the end of a difficult fortnight.","Ronny Deila's first competitive domestic game ended in comfortable victory .

The Merseyside city was closely followed in the poll by Edinburgh, with Manchester coming in third. Londoner came in fourth while another Scottish city, Glasgow, came fifth. Researchers ranked the UK's top ten most pampered cities according to how much they've spent on beauty treatments this year. The PromotionalCodes.org.uk study was based on the number of online vouchers and discounts used per head for each city. Liverpool topped the list, with scousers splashing out the most on pampering treatments. Researchers were also able to break the results down to identify the areas where certain beauty treatments were the most popular. Chelmsford came out as the teeth-whitening capital of the UK, whereas Newcastle was the top spot for fake tans. Birmingham topped the list for hair colouring whilst Glasgow was the number one place for tattoo removal. People . in Leeds spent more on getting their nails done than in other cities, . whereas Edinburgh took the number one spot for waxing. Glamorous scousers: Coleen, pictured with husband Wayne (l) and Kim Cattrall, keen supporter of home football club Liverpool F.C. (r) One woman from Liverpool said: 'It's great to think that I live in the UK's most pampered city. 'People . round here do spend a lot on beauty treatments. If they're not having . their teeth whitened, they're having a fake tan or getting waxed. 'I . probably spend between £50 and £60 per month on my beauty regime but . that can shoot up to well over £100 if I'm getting my hair coloured.' 1.      Liverpool2.      Edinburgh3.      Manchester4.      London5.      Glasgow6.      Birmingham7.      Newcastle8.      Sheffield9.      Leeds10.    Leicester . But it's not just the women splashing out. One male Liverpudlian added: 'It's frightening to see how much some men are forking out on beauty treatments. 'Some of my mates are even spending as much as their girlfriends. 'Me, I'm just content with a trip down the barbers, a nice smelling aftershave and a good bar of soap.' A spokesperson from PromotionalCodes.org.uk said: 'It was really interesting to see which UK city spent the most per head on beauty treatments and products. 'Liverpool will no longer just be associated with The Beatles, it will be recognised nationally as our country's most pampered city as well. 'Beauty regimes are expensive so using voucher sites is one of the best ways of keeping the price down.'","Merseyside city was closely followed in poll by Edinburgh and Manchester .

"By . John Drayton . There have been some incredible own goals down the years but Milan Gajic may well have topped the lot of them on the opening weekend of the Swiss Super League season. Gajic and his team-mates looked in visable shock after the midfielder planted a sensational 25-yard volley into the top corner of the net, as a result giving opposition side St Gallen the lead. The Serbian midfielder looked a little dazy and confused after the goal, but one thing that was for certain is that it was one of, if not the sweetest strike the 27-year-old has hit during his career. Blunder: Gajic can't believe what's occurred after his attempted clearance flies into his own goal . Uh-oh: St Gallen players celebrate the bizarre goal which gave them a 2-1 lead in the game . Clinical: Gijac fires in an unstoppable drive...into the wrong goal . What made it all the more bizarre was that it appeared St Gallen had lost possession and Young Boys were in no danger of conceding, before Gajic quite literally had a moment of madness. Luckily for Gajic his blushes were saved after a last-gasp equaliser from Young Boys ensured a share of the spoils. However, this will be one moment the Serbian will never forget, and one world football won't either, with this surely already set to be the best own goal of the 2014-2015 season, unless something even more spectacular occurs. VIDEO Gonzalo Pineda scores Panenka against Spurs . Elsewhere, Real Sociedad defender Carlos Martinez also put the ball into his own net this weekend, and although not in as dramatic circumstances as Gajic's, it was still fairly bizarre considering the fact he tried to blame his goalkeeper for the goal afterwards! And that despite clearly heading the ball too high over the on-rushing keeper! To compound misery the Spanish side ended up losing 3-1 to their Dutch opponents, Ajax, in the friendly game. Not the best day at the office for Martinez - that's for sure.

"By . Lucy Waterlow . British brand Boots have been accused of ripping off their UK customers as their No7 products can be bought for a fraction of the price in the U.S. Many of the products in the company's popular beauty range costs £10 less from the U.S. store Walgreens than is charged by Boots in their UK stores and online. For example, the No7 Lift & Luminate Day Cream costs £23 from Boots while from Walgreens, it is available for $20.99 (£12.47). Scroll down for video . Ugly truth: Boots anti-ageing products are cheaper in the U.S . Meanwhile, the Boots No7 Protect & Perfect Intense Serum is £24.95 from Boots but $24.99 from Walgreens (£14.85). Boots was founded in the UK when John Boot opened his first store in 1849 in Nottingham selling herbal remedies. It opened its 1,000th  store in 1933 followed by . the No7 cosmetics range two years later. Over . the decades, Boots have remained a trusted and popular store on the British . High Street - there are now 1,112 health and beauty stores nationwide . and 65 flagship stores and its headquarters remain in Nottingham. Its . modern range of No7 anti-ageing skincare has won awards and is in . demand following proven results in consumer testing and clinical trials. But one British beauty blogger said . 'it's a kick in the teeth' that products from such a historic British . brand are more expensive for UK consumers. Charlie Lankston, who writes the blog Small Fish Big Pond, . said: 'This drives me mad! It's the case with so many beauty products . and brands unfortunately; I went to New York recently and went on . something of a large beauty spree. Part of this was because I was so . eager to pick up products that aren't yet available here but a lot of it . was to do with the fact that everything was so much cheaper over there. Price difference: The No7 serum is £24.95 online and in UK stores, left, while at Walgreens it's $24.99 (£14.85) Saving: The No7 Day Cream is £23 in the UK, left, and £10 cheaper at Walgreens at $20.99 . 'U.S. drugstores have brilliant deals that mean you can pick up products for a fraction of the price that you can here. 'Needless to say it can make you feel a bit frustrated at times and when a British brand seems to favour its American consumers over beauty lovers from its home nation, it's a bit of a kick in the teeth.' Hayley Carr, who writes the beauty blog London Beauty Queen, agreed. She told the MailOnline: 'I'm incredibly disappointed to learn that a British brand with so much history is offering their products at much cheaper prices outside the UK. I've come to believe that because Boots develop and retail all their own products that they're offered at the most affordable price point, cutting out the usual margins that retailers take. 'However, this has fundamentally lead me to question the brand's ethos and pricing structure - there's such a massive difference in price from the UK to the U.S. that it makes you wonder how this is even possible? Or why they're willing to offer their products at a much cheaper price point, which will no doubt have a negative impact on their brands perception and position in the long-term. 'It appears that British consumers are getting a hard deal, when we've been the ones supporting No7 from its inception. Bad form Boots.' Home grown: Founded in Nottingham, Boots have been a presence on the British High Street for more than a century . Meanwhile, Lauren John, who writes the lifestyle blog These City Days, said: 'I always expect price variations with currency changes and so on, but for a brand that in my eyes doesn't do a whole lot throughout the year through offers and promotions on their products, it's a bit disappointing that UK customers don't benefit from savings, even occasional ones, especially from leading products like their serums.' A Boots UK spokesperson told the MailOnline: 'At Boots UK we know our customers want the best quality products at affordable prices. Which is why we offer our UK customers great value in lots of ways that we know you really appreciate. 'We offer benefits through our Boots Advantage Card, which gives you 4 points for every £1 you spend, as well as  regular promotions, including 3 for 2 across lots of your favourite products and customised coupons, throughout the year. You can visit boots.com to find out our latest prices and offers.' Walgreens . bought a 45 per cent stake in Boots the Chemist owner Alliance Boots for . 6.7 billion dollars (£4 billion) in 2012 and it was announced . today that they will form a partnership with the U.S. retailer under the company . name Walgreens Boots Alliance. Despite the partnership, the Boots headquarters will remain in Nottingham. Bargains: Dozens of beauty products are cheaper in Walgreens stores than in the UK . Boots aren't the only company who are charging more for their beauty products in the UK. Brands such as Maybelline and L'Oreal can be bought for less on the otherside of the Atlantic. And it's not just on beauty products that Brits are getting a bad deal. Yesterday, the Daily Mail reported how Swedish company Ikea are charging British buyers more than consumers in the U.S. and Europe for its products. And last month it emerged that British shoppers were paying hundreds of pounds more for TVs, computers and tablets compared to U.S. consumers. Research by Which? discovered that a top-of-the-range Samsung TV costs £755 more in the UK than in the US. An Apple MacBook Pro 13in laptop was £355 more expensive here, while the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 games consoles cost £95 more when they were bought in Britain.","No7 Lift & Luminate Day Cream costs £23 from Boots .

"By . Marielle Simon For Daily Mail Australia . Health experts have issued a warning to parents after a primary school started selling Subway six-inch rolls in its canteen. Students at Golden Grove Lutheran Primary school in Adelaide can now buy the fast food subs twice a week, despite concerns over the amount of fat and sugar in its products. The idea was the brainchild of a mother of two pupils at the school - who is also the owner of a nearby franchise - and comes after teachers failed to find volunteers to staff the canteen. Fast food chain, Subway, and Golden Grove Lutheran Primary School has joined together, serving their students Subway twice a week . However, the move has concerned Dieticians Association of Australia spokeswoman Lisa Renn, who fears children could get bad eating habits if they have access to Subway at school. 'It is important to not establish the habit in the first place because it is hard to break.' Ms Renn told the Daily Mail Australia. Bad eating habits can lead to obesity in children . 'Hopefully this doesn't open the gates for allowing all sorts of fast food. 'Under the dietary guidelines for Australian children it is recommended that children only consumer zero to two serves of extra food a day, if the child isn't doing physical activity that consumption is zero. 'A meatball sub option would come under an extra in the saturated fat category. 'What we would prefer to see is offering yoghurt or fruit which would tick the dairy and fruit requirements, not a cookie or juice.' Ms Renn added having Subway is not always unhealthy, as long as serve sizes are strictly monitored. Students at Golden Grove can order four or six-inch subs and can also buy a cookie or a juice, according The Advertiser. In South Australia, the government-backed Right Bite scheme offers guidelines about what food schools in the state should serve. The rules ban high fat, high sugar and heavily processed foods in canteens. Pam Kent, president of SA Primary Principals Association, said it was quite clear what should and should not be sold to students. She added more schools in South Australia are outsourcing canteens because volunteers are hard to find. Golden Grove Lutheran Primary School in Adelaide signed a deal with Subway after failing to find canteen volunteers . 'There is a lack of volunteers... there is not a massive attraction of helping in canteens in a voluntary capacity. Some schools have had to close their canteens, while others have had to outsource,' she told The Advertiser. 'The healthy eating regulations have kicked in which is a good thing, but the capacity to have big turnover with healthy foods has diminished as a result. Neighbouring school, Wynn Vale Primary, shares its canteen with Golden Grove but has not employed Subway. 'We follow the healthy eating policy from the government,' principle Graeme Fenton said. 'We haven't felt the need to go down that path, there would be a consulting process with the governing body of the school.' Subway didn't returns calls from Daily Mail Australia.

But she ended up coming away with a love of hula hooping and has been hard at it in her garden it for two hours a day ever since. Lisa Sampson, 34, is performing at the circus tonight but couldn't even touch her toes two years ago . The former hairdresser is now so skilled that she has now set up her own hula-hoop classes. Lisa said: 'I saw this person perform and I just thought 'I really want to do that, it looks so cool'. That's where the inspiration came from. 'So I bought my daughter a hoop for her to practice with and ended up using it myself. 'Unfortunately I broke that one so I bought another one - then when I got really good I started making my own and trying and learning more and more new tricks. 'I bought DVDs and watched YouTube videos to teach myself new tricks. 'My kids have never taken it up - Damon is into stilt walking and often walks on them to school but otherwise none of them followed up the workshop.' The former hairdresser now runs her own hula-hoop classes and debuts her act tonight . Lisa's children, Shaquille, 15, . Mya, 12, and Damon, eight, and husband of five years Neil Sampson, 40, who works in IT, are all 100 per cent behind her new passion in life. They will all be in attendance in the audience tonight in Shoreham, West Sussex, where Lisa will be spinning more than 30 hoops around her body during her three-minute act at Circus Wonderland, which is on until Sunday. She added: 'They all thought it was really funny to watch me at first in the garden because I couldn't keep the hoop up. 'So I thought 'I will do this' and now they absolutely love it. 'Quite often when they have their mates round they ask me to perform my new tricks for them so I like to think they're big fans of what I do. 'I never had an interest in the circus at all until I went to this workshop and visited the circus I'm now performing at last year.

"By . Louise Cheer For Daily Mail Australia . and Associated Press . and Australian Associated Press . The faces of nine of the 13 surrogate babies Thai police suspect are fathered by a Japanese businessman have been revealed. In a press conference on Tuesday, the children at the centre of the latest surrogacy controversy were brought to the forefront as authorities crackdown on Thailand's surrogacy trade. The sudden surge in scandals of this nature emerging comes after Australian couple David and Wendy Farnell were accused of leaving baby Gammy behind with his Thai surrogate mother when they found out he had Down syndrome. Scroll down for video . Media gather to capture the faces of nine of the surrogate babies fathered by a Japanese businessman at the Royal Thai Police headquarters . Pattaramon Chanbua, 21, became the face of the international outcry when she spoke out about the alleged abandonment. Last Friday, police found four more babies they believed were fathered by the Japanese businessman who has since fled Thailand. Officers did not release any more information about the children or where they were found, according to the ABC. This latest development brings the total number of babies related to the businessman found in Bangkok in the same week to 13. Another nine were found after police raided a Bangkok apartment earlier in same week and found nine babies aged from several weeks to one year. The 24-year-old man, accused of being embroiled in a surrogate 'baby farming' racket, was allowed to leave the country, carrying an infant, on a Japanese passport, according to The Weekend Australian. Police Colonel Napunwut Liamsanguan told Reuters the alleged father of the children had travelled 'in and out of Bangkok many times'. The Australian consulate in Thailand issues passports to surrogate babies born to Australian biological parents . The revelation came when police descended on a clinic in the Thai capital on Friday that was believed to have provided the in vitro fertilisation (IVF) service to conceive the babies after receiving a tip from one of the surrogates. Police believe the clinic - which was empty and had no documents left over - had violated the code of conduct relating to their licence to perform the procedure. A second clinic owned by the same doctor was also searched by police on Friday. The penalty for such offences could see the clinic's doctor jailed for up to one year and face a fine of up to $671. But if they were not certified to perform surrogacy, the doctor could face an extra three years' jail and see a fine of more than $2,000. This comes after Thai officials criticised the Australian Government's role in feeding the controversial surrogacy trade in Thailand by allowing agencies to play a part in the citizenship process. Due to the high demand of surrogate-born babies in Thailand, the Thai Government claims it is finding it practically impossible to regulate the movement of newborns leaving the country on foreign passports - set-up in part by the surrogate agencies themselves. All passport documentation is handled by surrogate agencies before it is processed by Australian immigration, and this is proving problematic for the Thai Government because it keeps the controversial industry profitable. It also makes it difficult for Thai officials to keep track of babies born by surrogacy leaving which leave the country. Wanchai Ruchanawong of the Attorney-Generals Department said the Thai Government does not have records of when prospective parents enter as a couple and leave as a family - but it should. 'The Western couples come in as two and walk out as three, with a Thai child,' Wanchai Ruchanawong told The Weekend Australian. He said this makes it particularly difficult to keep track of the legally 'grey' surrogate trade when their is no stringent immigration checks at the border. 'Immigration should have records - this is totally bizarre to us,' Mr Wanchai said. Pattaramon Janbua is the birth mother of baby Gammy who  is embroiled in a Thai-Australian surrogacy scandal . His comments come almost two weeks after the global uproar of baby Gammy, and since then the Thai government announced 100 clinics and hospitals had carried out thousands of unregulated in vitro procedures on local mothers for foreign biological western parents. A spokesman for Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said yesterday that Australian citizenship laws does not differentiate how a child came to be born if he or she is the descent of an Australian passport holder. “The Australian Citizenship Act 2007 does not differentiate how a child came to be born,' he said. 'Any application for Australian citizenship by descent is predicated on the link between parent and child.' He said over the over the past five years, more than 800 citizenship-by-descent applications involving surrogacy arrangements (from all countries) have been approved. The legal situation of Australians with recent or pending surrogate births still in Thailand has not yet been clarified by the National Council of Peace and Order interim military government. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's advice to Australians intending to use foreign surrogacy services is to check host country’s laws and visa arrangements. The advice also states people should: 'Extreme caution is exercised by the Australian government in cases involving surrogacy arrangements that are entered into overseas, so as to ensure that Australia’s citizenship and passport provisions are not used to circumvent either adoption laws or other child welfare laws.'","The 24-year-old Japanese national left the country with an infant in tow .

"By . Sarah Dean . A Queensland mother has claimed she was forced to spend over $2000 on head lice treatment for her daughter due to a perpetual nit problem at her child's school. Katherine Forster, from Logan City, south of Brisbane, in Queensland, has spent a staggering amount on lice killer over the past year after applying lotion to her daughter Chloe's scalp every two days. But she says she is still losing the battle against the bugs. Scroll down for video . Problem: Katherine Forster (right) has spent over $2,000 on lice treatment for her daughter Chloe (left) MsForster blamed her daughter's Marsden State Primary School, in Logan City, for allegedly not sending out letters to other parents to warn them of the infestation. 'It's ridiculous. It's a complete outbreak at the moment,' she told Channel Nine's Today show. 'Lately the school hasn't sent any letters so hasn't done anything to help with the outbreak,' she said. Worried: The Queensland mother is concerned her daughter's school allegedly hasn't contacted other parents . Losing battle: Ms Forster applies treatment to her daughter's head every two days . Chloe appeared with her mother on the show and admitted that there has been a nit problem at her school. Her concerned mother, said: 'I've spoken to the principal in regards to things that can be done and they just said there's nothing they can do.' Head lice are small, wingless, egg laying insects, which can grow to about 3.5mm (the size of a sesame seed or pin head). Inspection: The costly cream has not not prevented the nits from coming back again and again . They live on the hair and feed by sucking blood from the scalp. According to advice from the Queensland government, 'all parents should check their children and other family members for head lice regularly'. The government's website says 'the most effective way to detect head lice is by using the hair conditioner and combing method'. The school: Ms Forster pointed the blame at Marsden State Primary School, in Logan City, south east Queensland . A spokesperson for the Department of Education, Training and Employment told MailOnline: 'Primary responsibility for the management and treatment of head lice in students belongs with parents, not school staff or nurses.'Clear advice outlining management strategies and communication options in the event of head lice infestations is available to principals on the Department’s website.'If an infestation does occur, schools will determine the most appropriate course of action for addressing the issue at a local level.'The presence of head lice is not a notifiable condition, unlike measles or whooping cough, and there is no legislated requirement for schools to send home letters to parents when advised that a student is being treated for head lice.'The spokesperson added: 'Marsden State School has received one complaint about head lice from a member of the school community, and as such is not aware of a head lice infestation.'The school responded with individual advice for the family to avoid chemical treatments and use comb and conditioner method as per Queensland Health recommendations.'","Katherine Forster uses lotion on her daughter's scalp every two days .

"By . Mark Duell . A 10-year-old boy who had suffered a bad reaction to morphine died after being prescribed an opiate patch by an A&E doctor who overruled a hospital pharmacist, an inquest heard today. Jane Warren, 39, wept as she told an inquest how she discovered the body of her son Tom on the sofa at the family’s three-bedroom bungalow in Greenwich, south-east London. She told Southwark Coroner’s Court: ‘His lips were pale; I put my hand underneath his nose next to see if I could feel his breathing. I couldn’t, I called 999.’ Aged just 10: Tom Warren (pictured), who had suffered a bad reaction to morphine, died after being prescribed an opiate patch by an A&E doctor who overruled a hospital pharmacist, an inquest heard . Mrs Warren said that two days earlier she had taken her son - a Charlton Athletic football fan who died in November 2008 - to A&E at nearby Queen Elizabeth Hospital because he was in acute pain. There, she overheard Dr Lewis Ingram, who is no longer on the medical register following mental health issues, put pharmacist Manisha Daudia ‘in her place’ as he insisted she issue the prescription. The inquest heard Tom, who has a twin-sister called Megan, was born premature, weighing just 2lbs 8oz. His parents later found he suffered from cerebral palsy and mild sclerosis. Tom was in a wheelchair and had problems with his hips. He underwent a seven-hour operation in 2008 to try to relieve his hip pain - after which he was still in agony, so doctors gave him morphine. Southwark Coroner Dr Andrew Harris asked Mrs Warren: ‘You say his mood changed and he became uncontrollable, and the doctors said his behaviour could be because of him being given morphine?’ She replied: ‘That’s what I was told.’ Mrs Warren said that after his operation Tom suffered from intermittent pain, adding: ‘It wasn’t constant pain, but every now and then he would complain of it.’ Discovery: Jane Warren found the body of her son Tom on the sofa at the family's three-bedroom bungalow on this road in Greenwich, south-east London . The family had organised a meeting with Tom’s doctor, Dr Martin Gough, at QEH, but four days before the scheduled meeting his pain increased, leading him to be taken to A&E at the hospital. Mrs Warren got a phone call from Tom’s school saying he was in a lot of pain - and she was advised by a physiotherapist to take him to A&E, the inquest heard. Distraught: Tom's parents Benjamin, 41, and Jane Warren, 39, of Greenwich, south-east London . She said the pain would come and go because one minute he would be chatting, then ‘the colour would drain from his face’. Tom was examined by Dr Lewis Ingram when he arrived at the hospital, the inquest heard. Mrs Warren said: ‘He said “has Tom had morphine recently?” I said “yes” he had, and asked if he couldn’t have morphine because of the reaction he had. He explained that there is an opiate in the same family, and it reacts in a different way and is in a patch.’ The doctor prescribed the opiate patch to Tom and the family went to the hospital pharmacy to collect the prescription, the inquest heard. However, Mrs Warren said that Ms Daudia was not happy with the prescription when they went to collect it, and Dr Ingram arrived. Mrs Warren added: ‘We couldn’t hear the whole conversation, but it was clear that the pharmacist wasn’t happy with Tom taking opiates.’ Dr Harris asked her: ‘You say the pharmacist was fighting her corner to try and get something different?’ Mrs Warren replied: ‘He put her in her place and you could overhear him talking about all his years of experience and he was in no doubt this was the right way to go. She then came over and said he had halved the dose.’ The inquest was told that Tom’s parents used the opiate patch and it was not removed until he reached the hospital the day he died. Later in the hearing, hospital pharmacist Ms Daudia admitted she was ‘not happy’ about the strength of the dose a doctor had prescribed. Tom suffered a bad reaction to an opiate patch he was given containing 25mg of fentanyl and diazepam. Ms Daudia told the hearing she . confronted Dr Ingram, who had initially prescribed 50mg, about the . strength of the dose, but she had been overruled. She said she was unsure about whether Tom . had previously been prescribed morphine and thought 25mg might be far . too strong for someone who was ‘opiate naïve’. Treatment: Two days before finding the body of her son at the house in Greenwich, Mrs Warren said she had taken him to A&E at nearby Queen Elizabeth Hospital (pictured) because he was in acute pain . She said: ‘I had concerns 50mg was too . high, especially as it was well over the product recommendations, and I . suggested 12mg would be more appropriate. ‘I . did try to explore further his mother’s statement that morphine does . not suit Tom, but without success. Dr Ingram said that dose would not . touch Tom’s pain as he believed Tom’s pain level was chronic. Concerns: Mrs Warren said she overheard Dr Lewis Ingram put pharmacist Manisha Daudia (pictured) 'in her place' as he insisted she issue the prescription . ‘I suggested ordinary painkillers, but he said they would not help. But he agreed to lower the dose to 25mg. The lowest available dose was 12mg. ‘I tried to explain my feelings about putting Tom on a lower dose first, but the difficulty I had was Dr Ingram interrupted me in the middle of my sentences. I made him aware of my concerns, but he did not really acknowledge them. 'I was still not happy with the dose, but I felt I had tried my best and the doctor was not going to listen to what I would say. 'I relied on Dr Ingram’s experience and clinical judgement. If he had stayed at 50mg I don’t think I would have given the prescription.’ Ms Daudia, who had been in the post for just two months, said she had spoken to senior pharmacists and two other doctors for advice, none of whom had said the initial dose was dangerous. She said: ‘I don’t feel anyone stepped into help me deal with the actual prescription. ‘The level of the drug was outside the product licence, but the majority of drugs prescribed to children were “off label” because of the limitations of testing and the difficulty of carrying out clinical trials on children. ‘One senior pharmacist said she had never encountered a dose like that in children before. But nobody told me it was dangerous.’ Despite her doubts, Ms Daudia gave the patch to Tom, who collapsed on the sofa while wearing it at the family home, the inquest heard. She said she was aware the patch could cause ‘depression of the central nervous system and respiration’ but did not tell Tom’s mother of the possible side effects. Ms Daudia said: ‘I told her about the effects of drowsiness and sedation. I should have mentioned depression of the central nervous system, but didn’t. But I would not have expected this to . happen - it was a rare side effect. 'You don’t tell patients of all the . side effects, otherwise they might not take a drug that could help them . because they are too scared.’ In . giving her evidence, Ms Daudia said, looking back, she . would not have given Tom the drug.  She added: ‘With hindsight I should . have refused to dispense the prescription. ‘But, . however, I do not feel I had the experience or training to disagree . with Dr Ingram even further. I was adequately satisfied with Dr Ingram’s . explanation. I did all I could to help Tom’s pain.’ Paying tribute to Tom, his mother said: . ‘He was a fun-loving little man, who could charm the birds out of the . trees. He loved his football, he loved his music, he loved life, and he . was humorous and funny.’ Horror: Mrs Warren told Southwark Coroner's Court (pictured) that she couldn't feel her son breathing . After Mrs Warren finished giving evidence to the inquest, Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust apologised to the family for the death of their son. Malcolm Fortune, representing the Trust, said: ‘On behalf of the Trust, I would like to apologise publicly for the tragic loss of your son, Tom.’ Dr Ingram was unable to give evidence in person because he had a serious mental illness, the inquest heard. 'His lips were pale; I put my hand underneath his nose next to see if I could feel his breathing. I couldn't, I called 999' Jane Warren . Sarah Elliot QC, representing the Warren family, said: ‘The family should be able to understand why a key witness, who prescribed a drug which some of the witnesses are going to say may have contributed to his death, is not going to give live evidence before this court.’ Coroner Dr Harris said: ‘The family have been aware that serious mental issues dictate that Dr Ingram is not fit to give evidence.’ Mary O’Rouke QC, representing Dr Ingram, added: ‘The GMC have removed Dr Ingram from the medical register.’ The Coroner ruled that questions should be sent to Dr Ingram through the court and judged by his legal team and a psychiatrist if he can answer them. The inquest continues.","Jane Warren discovered body of son Tom on sofa at home in Greenwich .

"By . Corey Charlton . A terrified patient woke up in 'agony' during an operation being performed by an HIV-positive dentist who was later struck off the register. Donald Richardson claims he could have contracted the virus after he was given a general anaesthetic by disgraced Paisley dentist Harry Robertson - who wasn’t even qualified to knock people out. Robertson was struck off the dental register in July for lying about having HIV. Mr . Richardson, 52, requested the anaesthetic for a 2007 root canal . treatment and fillings because of his fear of needles and so paid £100 . in advance for a specialist anaesthetist to visit and ensure he was not . awake. Patient Donald Richardson said he was 'frozen with fear' when he woke up during the root canal procedure . But after a 40 minute wait the anaesthetist failed to turn up and Robertson took the situation into his own hands. Half an hour in to the procedure, he woke up in intense pain before Robertson rushed to give him more anaesthetic. He said: 'You can imagine my horror when I woke up to find him still working in my mouth. I was in agony.' He now faces an HIV test with his doctor with more needles and has complained to the NHS. Robertson refused to comment when confronted at his Glasgow home, despite some of his former patients remaining un-traced for HIV tests. Mr Richardson said: 'When I read about this doctor hiding his HIV from patients I was horrified. 'He put my life at risk by doing the anaesthetic himself and I will pursue him legally as far as I can take it now. 'Not only will I have to go through a test for HIV where I’ll have to face a needle but I now know that this man wasn’t even qualified to perform a general anaesthetic on me which is more worrying. 'This is a complicated procedure even for a qualified anaesthetist because if you don’t get the levels right you can kill someone. 'I sat in the waiting room for 40 minutes but he didn’t turn up. He took me into his room, sat me on the chair and administered it himself. 'I had no idea what was going on and I was completely knocked out. 'When I woke up half-way through he then got this massive needle and injected more anaesthetic into my gums. 'I was frozen with fear and I’ll never forget that day for the rest of my life. 'On the way out he handed me the £100 back but it was such a terrible experience I never went back to him. Kelburne Dental surgery in Paisley where Harry Robertson worked before he was struck off the register . 'This guy had obviously given me too little of the stuff and I woke up in the middle of it all. He could just as easily have given me too much and killed me. 'To lie about having HIV is bad enough but to carry out life-threatening procedures without being properly qualified is out of order. 'I’m absolutely terrified of having an HIV test, not because I fear I may have HIV, but because I will have to face a needle.' A spokesperson for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said the vast majority of Robertson's patients had been contacted to inform them of his HIV-status. 'There were people who we could not trace because they had moved from the area and we conducted a public awareness campaign in the hope these people would present for testing. 'Ultimately, however, it was down to a personal decision by individuals on whether to respond to our appeal for testing. 'Some 10,000 people have been tested and not a single person was found to have caught HIV as a result of medical or dental treatment.'","Donald Richardson was one of thousands treated by HIV-positive dentist .

"By . Kate Lyons For Daily Mail Australia . Luke Gibbons started viewing online pornography when he was a teenager and by the end of university was addicted to it . Luke Gibbons looks like any other young Australian guy. The 29-year-old has a job in marketing in Melbourne, enjoys going out with friends and spending time in the outdoors. Unlike many twenty-somethings, however, he has never had sex, never had a girlfriend, and has been to rehab – for his long-term addiction to pornography. Luke first saw pornography when he was 11 years old and a friend showed him one of his father's magazines. About this age he also remembers watching sex scenes on late-night television and in movies. But it was when his parents had the internet installed in their house that what began as 'curiosity' turned into a full-blown addiction. 'It was something I didn't want to be doing but I was doing it anyway. Even before I understood what an addiction was, that side of it meant it was an addiction for me,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'It was starting to take up large chunks of my time; I was lying to people about what I was doing in my spare time. I'd stay up viewing all night and go to work on an hour's sleep, it was affecting my productivity, my health, my relationships and friendships,' he said. 'There were times I didn't turn up to people's parties or I wouldn't go out, because I'd been viewing all day, or I'd think, I'll just view one more thing before I leave. It's a bit like when someone goes into a casino and they lose track of time and then they realise they've been in there for a day.' Pornography also sapped Luke's interest in finding a girlfriend. 'I still had an interest in relationships but I didn't ever feel that massive pull to do anything about it, compared to now, where I feel, I'd really like to have a relationship with someone, it's almost like the motivation isn't there… I was less interested in putting in the effort required to love somebody,' he said. Luke is one of the subjects speaking openly about the subject of pornography in an ABC documentary to be aired on Wednesday. He joins with Melbourne couple Ken and Gillian, whose relationship has been tested by Ken's sex addiction, and Elle and Jerome, who perform webcam 'peep shows' from their Sydney home. Luke Gibbons (right) now volunteers with an organisation that aims to raise awareness about the harmful effects of pornography . Before and after: (left) Luke at the snow before he went to rehab at the age of 25 (right) Luke kayaking after his stint in a rehab clinic for porn addiction . The journalist behind the documentary, Sabour Bradley, said he first got the idea of exploring the topic of pornography when he heard that a friend of a friend was going to rehab for an addiction to it. 'I had no idea the situation got so bad, I saw all these stories in the media bout relationships being destroyed by porn addiction, I thought, I need to understand this better,' he told Daily Mail Australia. Bradley talked to sex therapists and psychological experts in pornography addiction who likened the influence of pornography on relationships to 'a tsunami about to break' and 'cancer'. But despite its far-reaching effects, says Bradley, people often are still not willing to talk about pornography. 'We found people in porn addiction groups, in marriage counselling, in rehab centres; they were happy to talk but no one wanted to go on camera. There's this massive shame and guilt about porn.' Luke, who is a Christian, said he felt a 'deep level of shame' about his addiction and at the age of 25, sick of being at the mercy of his addiction, Luke's friends suggested he go to a rehabilitation centre in Adelaide. 'It sounded pretty full on, but I was willing to do anything because I really wanted to stop,' he said. Luke is one of the subjects of a documentary exploring sex and porn addiction, produced by Sabour Bradley (right). Other subjects include Jerome (left) and Elle (centre), who perform webcam 'peep shows' from their home . Luke's friends drove him out to the clinic and he spent six weeks at the clinic that catered to people with addictions of all kinds. 'The hardest thing was seeing those guys drive away. A lot of emotions came out, I remember calling my parents and telling them where I was… That's the day I felt myself hitting rock bottom and thinking: This is where it's brought me.' The journey since rehab has been long and sometimes difficult. 'I probably went in thinking, I'll do six weeks here and it'll be perfect, but that's not how it works,' he said. 'I can see how much better my life is now – I'm fitter, I'm healthier, I'm more connected with my friends, I feel better about myself.' Where once he was not particularly interested in finding a girlfriend, he is now going on dates and has been interested in a couple of different women. Luke volunteers with Guilty Pleasure, an organisation that aims to raise awareness about the harmful effects of pornography, and Luke says he has to work at re-wiring his brain in some respects. 'I'm working on… appreciating women as friends, seeing them as a beautiful creation of God. To treat them not as an object but as a living breathing person who deserves respect,' he said. Speaking to Daily Mail Australia the day before the documentary went to air he said he anticipated a 'sleepless night' and said he was 'naturally nervous' about airing his personal story on national television. 'My aim for sharing is really so that other who are struggling will know that there is hope and there is help out there.'

"By . Belinda Robinson . Death: Habib Ullah, 39, died after being restrained by up to five police officers during a drugs search in High Wycombe . Five police officers will face gross misconduct hearings but no criminal charges over the death of a man who collapsed after being restrained during a drugs search. Habib Ullah, 39, died after he was forced to the ground in a car park in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire in 2008 by police who believed he was hiding class A drugs in his mouth. Officers alleged that he refused to reveal a package of drugs hidden in his mouth. When a struggle followed, he collapsed. After an inquest into his death, the CPS decided that there was not . enough evidence for charges of manslaughter by gross negligence, . misconduct in public office, perjury and perverting the course of . justice. But the officers from Thames Valley . Police could face the sack after the Independent Police . Complaints Commission (IPCC) found grounds for gross . misconduct because the police gave different statements to the coroner and the IPCC. Today, his distraught relatives reacted with fury as prosecutors decided not to bring charges in the case. Mr Ullah's sister Nasrit Mahmood said: . ‘We are not happy that the CPS has decided not to charge those police . officers who are responsible for Habib's death.’ In 2008, an initial inquiry into Mr Ullah's death was conducted by the Independent Police Complaints Commission, but it was not referred to the CPS. Two years later, Mr Ullah’s girlfriend Emma . Forbes told a court that up to five officers restrained him as they . tried to force the package out of his throat, including one officer who . shouted ‘break his arm’. In 2011, the case was re-opened and new evidence emerged during police officers' accounts of what had taken place. The . investigation also looked at further opinion from restraint experts and . doctors. But the inquest was abandoned after concerns were raised about . the difference in statements the police had given to the coroner and . what they had previously told the IPCC. The Solicitors Regulation Authority is also considering the conduct of a Police Federation solicitor in . relation to Mr Ullah's death. Family man: Habib Ullah is pictured with his wife and two of his children before his death . Mr Ullah's sister Nasrit Mahmood added: ‘At the inquest they are caught out withholding evidence in front of everyone including the judge and jury. 'We have evidence of police cover-ups, so not only is it my opinion that they caused my brother's death but these police officers have not given a full and truthful account. 'How on earth can CPS disregard the facts? ‘This sadly shows that the CPS together with the IPCC are only there to protect and cover up police crimes. ‘Their decision has only shown their true colours but made us much stronger. ‘This is not justice for us and we will not give up until justice is served and that is a promise.’ Thames Valley Police Headquarters: The officers, from Thames Valley Police, could face the sack as watchdog the Independent Police Complaints Commission found grounds for gross misconduct . Guido Liguori, IPCC Associate Commissioner, said: ‘This has been a complex investigation which as we have said has taken an unbearably long time for Mr Ullah's family. ‘I am very sorry for the prolonged distress this has caused, but it has been essential to ensure that our investigation was robust and thorough. ‘Five officers and a solicitor were interviewed under caution and we felt there was sufficient evidence to refer to the CPS. 'In light of the CPS decision, we have now sent the report to the family of Mr Ullah and the SRA. 'In accordance with procedures under the Police Reform Act 2002 Thames Valley Police were sent a copy of the report in January 2014 and they have determined that five officers should now face gross misconduct hearings. 'We have also sent a copy of the report to the Coroner in advance of the inquest into Mr Ullah's tragic and untimely death.’ A spokesman for the CPS added that it was unable to establish a causal link, to the criminal standard, between the conduct of Thames Valley Police officers and Mr Ullah's death. They also questioned whether alterations made to their statements were intended or able to pervert the course of justice. He said: ‘The case has been thoroughly reviewed in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors.' ‘We carefully examined the evidence in this case, including evidence provided by experts in pathology, emergency medicine and policing techniques and accounts from eyewitnesses.’ ‘Since there is insufficient evidence to give rise to a realistic prospect of convicting any person of any criminal offence arising from the circumstances of Mr Ullah's death, we have advised the IPCC that no further criminal action should be taken. ‘Our thoughts remain with Mr Ullah's family at this difficult time for them and we fully understand that this is not the decision they will have wanted. 'We have written to them to explain our decision in detail and have offered to meet with them to discuss this matter should they so wish.’","The officers will face gross misconduct charges but not criminal charges .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Sky gazers were treated to a stunning photobomb of Saturn by the moon last night, as the satellite dramatically eclipsed the planet. In Western Australia, the event could be seen with the naked eye as Saturn disappeared behind the moon and reappeared on the other side. The event was one of 13 occultations between Saturn and the moon this year. These occur when one astronomical object moves in front of another. Scroll down for video . Photographer Colin Legg in Australia caught this stunning image of the event yesterday describing it as ‘a brilliant thing to watch'. Saturn is seen in the top right . Monday morning's occultation could only be seen by those in the Eastern Hemisphere, but stargazers everywhere were able to experience the event online. ‘It's quite dramatic when [an occultation] involves a bright photogenic object like Saturn, whose rings are now nearly optimally tilted,’ said Slooh astronomer Bob Berman who broadcast the event. He added there was ‘striking detail visible on the foreground of the moon and the background planet - a true photobomb moment.’ This image was tweeted by Space Geek yesterday. Saturn is peeking out from the moon on the top left. The event could only be seen in the Eastern Hemisphere . The moon shown eclipsing Saturn. The different views of the planet on the left are shown in this composite image created by M Wastell on Spaceweather gallery . An occulation occurs when once astronomical object moves in front of another. Lunar occultations are ideal for novice star gazers and suited for small telescopes, as they do not require locating a faint star in the sky. It is also possible for one planet to occult another planet. However, these mutual occultations of planets are extremely rare. The last such event occurred on 3 January 1818. Last night's event was one of 13 occultations between Saturn and the moon this year. In the Slooh video, you see two different views of the start of the occultation and three different views of its end. This line-up was obvious to anyone looked up in Australia, Slooh said, even from light polluted cities and without a telescope. The event, however, came too near dawn for people in the Western Hemisphere to see it. Colin Legg in Western Australia caught a stunning image of the event yesterday describing it as ‘a brilliant thing to watch.’ Twitter users also released their footage of the ‘photobomb’, using handheld point and shoot cameras, as well as more sophisticated equipment. By this evening, the moon's appearance in the sky will have glided toward the south to sit above the bright red star Antares. About a half hour before sunrise on Thursday, Venus will be visible in the low eastern horizon below the constellation Gemini.

"By . Pete D'amato . A sleepy English bulldog named Roxanne is being called a hero after waking up her owners by barking while the house around them burned. A fire started early Monday morning in the Long Island home of Roxanne's owners, Michael and Susan Herlihy, quickly erupting into a blaze that required the help of firefighters from five towns, reports Newsday. Huntington Fire Chief Robert Berry says the fire started shortly before 1:30 a.m. while the family was asleep. Alert: 'Hero' bulldog Roxanne snoozes with her owner Kevin Herlihy, who she woke by barking when their Long Island home caught fire . Five-year-old Roxanne was in bed with Kevin, the Herlihys' adult son, when the house began to catch flame. Roxanne kept barking until Kevin woke up and went to alert his parents. The family called 911 and fled the house. The first fire officials arrived within minutes. 'Upon arrival, we had fire through the roof,' Berry said. Nearly 50 firefighters coming from Huntington and neighboring Long Island towns worked for 90 minutes to extinguish the blaze. Investigators currently believe it was an electrical fire. 'Shaken' by the fire, Kevin revealed the identity of the family's savior to Berry, who 'thought that was great.' Howlingly close: The Herlihy home went up in flames but the family was able to escape thanks to their bulldog Roxanne, while investigators blame an electric fire . Catnap: Facebook photos of Roxanne often show her taking a snooze but she wasn't caught napping when the Herlihy house caught fire . Pets often take action in an emergency, as a pit bull in Indianapolis proved last month when he woke his deaf owner with 'warming kisses' to save him from a fire, according to the Daily News. In photos posted on Kevin's Facebook, Roxanne is often seen dozing in bed or lounging around, but when the moment called for action, she wasn't caught napping. The family will have to do without their hero hound while the house is rebuilt, as neighbor Michael Marcinik told Newsday that the hotel where the Herlihys are staying does not allow pets.","English bulldog Roxanne woke Kevin Herlihy, 24, who alerted his parents, Michael and Susan .

"By . Lizzie Parry . Every day teenager Shannon Blastland topples over as her body gives way and her bones slip out of place. In the last five years the 15-year-old has dislocated her spine, both shoulders, ankles, her neck, fingers and both wrists. The 15-year-old from Grimsby in Lincolnshire, suffers Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS), a condition which affects the collagen in her body - the connective tissues in the body. The rare illness causes Shannon's bones to slip out of place, causing her to tumble to the floor. Shannon Blastland, 15, suffers the rare condition Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, which causes her bones to slip out of place and dislocate without any warning. Her father Shane Fielding, pictured, is on hand to help his daughter pop her joints back into place, but when her neck or spine dislocates, she has to be taken into hospital . The teenager, from Grimbsy in Lincolnshire, has dislocated her spine, both shoulders, her wrists, fingers, ankles and neck in the last five years . Every bone in her body, including her spine and ribs, can dislocate without any warning. Shannon said: 'I am just like jenga - when one bit of me goes out of place I just topple over. 'I can guarantee that one part of me will go every day but I just have to be careful. 'Sometimes I can just pop the bone back into place and pick myself up but I do often end up in an ambulance.' Since her diagnosis three years ago, Shannon has had to be careful when carrying out even the simplest of tasks. Shannon said: 'I can’t walk out to the shops because I can’t walk too far without one of my joints going. 'I can’t dance because of my legs and I can’t play football with my younger brother and sister because that’s a guaranteed dislocated bone. 'I tried to start martial arts but every session ended with me in an ambulance so I had to give that up and even yoga had to go as it just made me more bendy. 'The only thing I can do which is safe is swimming - but then I did dislocate my leg last time I went. 'It does bug me but it is just one of those things.' Each day at least one of her bones slips out of place, causing Shannon to fall to the floor . Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is a collection of inherited conditions, known as heritable disorders of connective tissue. Connective tissues provide support in skin, tendons, ligaments, blood vessels, internal organs and bones. There are different types of EDS, which can cause: . The fragile skin and unstable joints may be the result of faulty collagen. Collagen is a protein in connective tissue that acts as a 'glue' in the body, adding strength and elasticity. The different types of EDS are caused by alterations in certain genes that make collagen weaker. In some cases the amount of collagen in the body is reduced. The faulty genes can be passed from parents to their children. Source: NHS Choices . Shannon was healthy until the age of 10, when EDS started to take control of her body. She said: 'I was standing in my doorway at home as my parents were decorating my bedroom when I suddenly collapsed into a heap on the floor. 'I asked my step dad for help to get back up and he saw my knee. He popped it back in to place and rushed me to hospital. 'I had dislocated it but they didn’t know why. After dislocating the same knee at least eight times I went to see a specialist. 'He thought it could be growing pains but said he couldn’t do anything as I was still growing. 'I had an operation but it didn’t seem to work.' Eventually Shannon was booked in to see a specialist at Sheffield Children’s Hospital in 2012. Shannon said: 'Since being diagnosed with EDS in 2012, I have dislocated my spine, both my shoulders, my ankles, my neck and many other parts of my body including my fingers and wrists. 'If it is a small part of my body then my dad will sort me out and just pop it back in place. 'But if it is more serious like my back or my neck, I have to be taken to hospital in an ambulance.' Shannon dislocates a different part of her body almost every day and says most people do not understand her condition. She . said: 'I was picked on at school because one day I would be in a . wheelchair after dislocating something and the next day I would be . walking. 'People didn’t understand it, so my family and I decided I should be home schooled. Shannon said: 'I am just like jenga - when one bit of me goes out of place I just topple over' 'I will go back to school at some point soon though, and am looking forward to making more friends. 'Although I have Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, I will keep picking myself up and I will never let it beat me.'

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . A dramatic supermoon is set to accompany this year’s Perseid meteor shower, one of the most anticipated events on the skywatcher’s calendar. Given a dark, clear sky in a normal year, it is common to see more than 100 of the meteors an hour during the second week in August. But this year the Perseids have a bright shining rival - a larger and brighter moon. Scroll down for videos . A yearly meteor shower event could be ruined by brighter and larger moon (stock image shown). This year the streaking balls of fire may be outshone by the supermoon, which occurs when the full moon coincides with its closest point to Earth. However when the Perseids peak on Tuesday they should still be visible . On Sunday, two days before the meteor shower reaches its peak, the moon will become full. Coincidentally, it will also have reached the point in its orbit that is closest to the Earth, known as 'perigee'. The supermoon will be up to 14 per cent bigger and 30 per cent brighter than other full moons during the year. On one level, this is bad news, according to Dr Bill Cooke from the American space agency Nasa’s Meteoroid Environment Office. 'Lunar glare wipes out the black-velvety backdrop required to see faint meteors, and sharply reduces counts,' he said. A supermoon occurs when the moon is both 'full' and at its closest point to Earth. Astronomers call this phenomenon a 'perigee moon,' which describes the full moon that occurs when the moon is at its closest point to Earth each year. Perigee marks the closest point a body reaches as it orbits around its host object such as Earth, while apogee marks the farthest point from its parent body. Almost every orbit has an apogee and perigee because orbits tend to be elliptical rather than perfectly circular, so even Earth has an apogee and perigee around the sun. But the debris stream left by comet Swift-Tuttle, which produces the Perseids, is wide so the shooting stars could make an appearance well before the moon becomes full. Dr Cooke added that the Perseids were also 'rich in fireballs as bright as Jupiter or Venus' that would remain visible despite the moon’s glare. A study conducted by his team since 2008 has shown the Perseids to be the undisputed 'fireball champion' of meteor showers. 'We see more fireballs from Swift-Tuttle than any other parent comet,' said Dr Cooke. Tony Markham, director of the Society for Popular Astronomy’s (SPA) meteor section, also urged skywatchers to stay optimistic. 'The Perseids are rich in bright meteors and so many Perseids will still be seen despite the moonlit sky background,' he said, writing on the SPA’s website. 'You can minimise the effect of the moonlight by observing with your back to the moon - possibly viewing the Cassiopeia/Cepheus/Ursa Minor area. 'If possible, keep the moon hidden behind trees or a nearby building.' The Perseids will be visible from US and UK from Saturday to Wednesday. The meteors can also be viewed from elsewhere in the northern hemisphere. In this picture a Perseid meteor is seen shooting above an aurora in the night sky in Quebec, Canada on 12 August 2008 . Astronomers observe a perigee moon in Bulgaria on 12 July. On Sunday, two days before the meteor shower reaches its peak, the moon will become full. Coincidentally, it will also have reached the point in its orbit that is closest to the Earth, making it 14 per cent bigger and 30 per cent brighter than other full moons during the year . He pointed out that at this time of year the moon is relatively close to the horizon, leaving much of the sky dark. Mr Markham also suggested looking at an area of sky 20 to 30 degrees away from the Perseid radiant - the spot near the constellation of Perseus that the meteors appear to fly out from. Every 133 years, comet Swift-Tuttle swings through the inner solar system leaving behind a trail of dust. When the Earth passes through, the dust cloud particles hit the atmosphere at 140,000 miles (225 km) per hour and burn up in streaking flashes of light, creating the spectacle known as the Perseids. The best time to see the meteors is between Saturday and Wednesday, with activity peaking on Tuesday. An unusually bright full supermoon was also seen on 12 July, and another is due to appear on 9 September. But the supermoon of Sunday promises to be the most dramatic since this is when the moon will be at its closest point to the Earth all year. At perigee, the moon is around 31,000 miles (50,000 km) closer than when it is furthest away from Earth. Supermoons occur relatively often, with four to six occurring on average every year, but are not always noticed because of clouds or poor weather.","Yearly meteor shower event could be ruined by brighter and larger moon .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . One of the biggest volcanic eruptions ever seen in the solar system  has been spotted on Jupiter’s active moon Io. The huge eruption took place in August 2013 but has now been revealed in a series of stunning images taken by the Gemini Observatory. And the massive outpourings of magma, far exceeding the temperature of anything produced in volcanoes on Earth today, could help provide information into the early history of planets like ours. This image of Io was taken in the near-infrared with adaptive optics at the Gemini North telescope on 29 August 2013. In addition to the extremely bright eruption on the upper right limb of the satellite, the lava lake Loki is visible in the middle of Io’s disk, as well as a fading eruption that was detected earlier in the month at its base . This particular eruption was the ‘grand finale’ of a series of eruptions that took place over a number of weeks. Io, the innermost of Jupiter's four large ‘Galilean’ moons, is about 2,300 miles across (3,630 kilometers). Aside from Earth, it is the only known place in the solar system with volcanoes erupting extremely hot lava like that on our planet. With over 400 active volcanoes it is the most volcanic place in the solar system - including Earth. Because of Io's low gravity, large eruptions produce an umbrella of debris that rises high into space. Volcanoes were first discovered on Io in 1979, and subsequent studies by Nasa's Galileo spacecraft, which first flew by Io in 1996, and ground-based telescopes showed that eruptions and lava fountains occur constantly, creating rivers and lakes of lava. Only 13 large eruptions were observed between 1978 and 2006, in part because only a handful of astronomers regularly scan the moon. The eruptions on Io are likely similar to those that shaped the surfaces of the inner solar system planets such as Earth and Venus in their youth. The first two massive eruptions were spotted on 15 August 2013 by Dr Imke de Pater of University of California, Berkeley (UCB) in Io's southern hemisphere. This was done using the near-infrared camera (NIRC2) on the Keck II telescope, one of two 10-meter (33 feet) telescopes operated by the Keck Observatory in Hawaii . The brightest of the first two at a caldera - an opening that can accompany a volcano - named Rarog Patera was calculated to have produced a lava flow 50 square miles (130 square kilometres) in area and 30 feet (10 metres) thick. The other eruption, close to another caldera called Heno Patera, produced flows covering 120 square miles (310 square kilometers). A third and even brighter eruption - one of the brightest ever seen on Io - was then found on 29 August using both the Near-Infrared Imager with adaptive optics on the Gemini North telescope on Mauna Kea, and the SpeX near-infrared spectrometer on Nasa's nearby Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF). The researchers said this was more than 10,000 times more powerful than the  2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajokull in Iceland. They concluded that the energy emitted was about 20 Terawatts and expelled many cubic kilometers of lava. These images of Io were at the Gemini North telescope and track the evolution of the eruption as it decreased in intensity over 12 days. Due to Io’s rapid rotation, a different area of the surface is viewed on each night; the outburst is visible with diminishing brightness on 29 and 30 August and 1, 3 and 10 September . Graduate student and researcher Katherine de Kleer showed that the eruption temperature was probably much higher than comparable ones on Earth today. She said it was ‘indicative of a composition of the magma that on Earth only occurred in our planet's formative years.’ Dr de Pater, meanwhile, explains how they usually expect one huge outburst form Io every one or two years, but they’re not normally this bright. 'Here we had three extremely bright outbursts, which suggest that if we looked more frequently we might see many more of them on Io,’ he explained. And his colleague and co-author Ashley Davies of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) said the recent eruptions match past events that spewed tens of cubic miles of lava over hundreds of square miles in a short period of time. 'These new events are in a relatively rare class of eruptions on Io because of their size and astonishingly high thermal emission,' Davies said. 'The amount of energy being emitted by these eruptions implies lava fountains gushing out of fissures at a very large volume per second, forming lava flows that quickly spread over the surface of Io.' All three events, including the largest, most powerful eruption of the trio on 29 August 2013, were likely characterized by 'curtains of fire' as lava blasted out of fissures perhaps several miles long. 'We are using Io as a volcanic laboratory, where we can look back into the past of the terrestrial planets to get a better understanding of how these large eruptions took place, and how fast and how long they lasted,' Davies said. Io, the innermost of Jupiter's four large ‘Galilean’ moons, is about 2,300 miles across (3,630 kilometers). Aside from Earth, it is the only known place in the solar system with volcanoes erupting extremely hot lava like that on our planet. In this image an 86-mile (138 km) high plume was spotted by the Galileo spacecraft in 1997 . The third and brightest eruption - one of the brightest ever seen on Io - was found on 29 August using both the Near-Infrared Imager with adaptive optics on the Gemini North telescope (shown) on Mauna Kea, and the SpeX near-infrared spectrometer on Nasa's nearby Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF)","Gemini Observatory in Hawaii captured massive volcano on the moon Io .

A college student who more than two years ago suffered massive brain injuries in a horrific car crash and was in a coma has made an amazing recovery and is back to playing basketball again and attending college.The recovery made by Sam Schmid, 23, of Tucson, Arizona has been described as a 'Christmas miracle' by his mother.

And then, in December 2011, Schmid woke up and was able to talk.And after more than two years of treatment at the Center for Transitional Neuro Rehabilitation at Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, Schmid walked out of the facility last month.'I am surprised at the end result,' Schmid told ABC News. 'I was willing to comply with all the help at Barrow and my recovery is based on the hard work I did.'When Schmid arrived at Barrow, he was using a walker, had trouble speaking and had difficulty swallowing.

Schmidt has recovered so well, he is able to play basketball and has returned to his studies at the University of Arizona . 'I would describe it as a fragile state physically and emotionally,' Barrow neuropsychologist Kristi Husk told ABC News. But the 'boot camp”-like intensity of rehabilitation inspired Schmid, who volunteering at a gym for the disabled while undergoing rehab and worked at the hospital mail room and library. One person who never doubted Schmid's ability to recovery was neurosurgeon Dr. Robert Spetzler, who said that while others had 'reasonable' reasons to think Schmid was brain dead, he had a 'hunch' he would make it.'There was plenty wrong -- he had a hemorrhage, an aneurysm and a stroke from the part of the aneurysm,' Spetzler said in 2011. 'But he didn't have a blood clot in the most vital part of his brain, which we know he can't recover from. And he didn't have a massive stroke that would predict no chance of a useful existence.'An MRI was ordered of Schmid's brain to see if important areas of the brain had turned dark, an indication of brain death. It contained encouraging news. And the evening the MRI results came in, Schmid was able to follow doctor commands such as holding up two fingers. Sam's mother, Susan Regan, now looks back and calls his recovery 'a godsend.''Sam is as he is today as a result of their driving him to succeed. He gets better every day,' she said.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . From columns that shake, to waves of colours and rotating snakes, these optical illusions should not be viewed if you've just eaten. Each stomach-churning design was created by a former animal psychologist who became fascinated by the illusions when he studied monkeys in a neuroscience institute. They are so powerful that each image comes with a health warning, and if you start to feel dizzy or sick cover one eye and look away - don’t close your eyes completely. Scroll down for video . Professor Akiyoshi Kitaoka, from Ritsumseikan University, in Kyoto, Japan, has spent more than a decade creating his collection of works. The professor devised the Rotating Snake illusion (pictured) in 2003, which comes with a warning on his website, due to the feeling of nausea it could cause some viewers . Optical Illusions use colour, light and patterns to create images that deceive or mislead the brain. The information collected by the eye is processed by the brain. In the process of converting what it sees, the brain tries to make sense of the different colours and patterns. This creates a perception that doesn't match the image, and confuses the brain. This is because the illusions can become more prominent, and the effect worsens, when eyes are closed completely. The images were created by Professor Akiyoshi Kitaoka, from Ritsumseikan University, in Kyoto Japan. The 52-year-old has spent more than a decade creating his collection either from scratch, or by developing existing designs. The professor also devised the Rotating Snake illusion in 2003, which comes with a warning on his website due to the feeling of nausea it can cause some viewers. This image is called Irrigation and it looks like rollers printed with blue dots turning towards each other in a line. Each design is either created through a process of trial and error, or based on illusion experiments of the past. Professor Kitaoka began designing the images in the mid-90s, and has created hundreds of different designs . Professor Kitaoka’s Button image (pictured) features rows of circles that look like they’re increasing in size and coming towards the viewer. Optical Illusions use colour, light and patterns to create images that deceive or mislead the brain.

Each design is either created through a process of trial and error, or based on illusion experiments of the past. He began designing the images in the mid-90s, and has since created hundreds of different illusions. Irrigation (pictured) works in a similar way to the Rollers image.

This image, called Snake Conveyors, features rows that appear to move diagonally, especially when viewed in a person's peripheral vision. Though more straightforward experiments, such as the eye's interpretation of the colour, are important to science, the professor said that the public generally prefer his more artist works . Optical illusions, which were extremely popular during the Op Art movement of the 1960s, create the feeling that a motionless image is somehow moving. In this image, called Ampan Factory, the columns of red dots appear to move up and down on the blue background and at times look like they're shaking .

Optical illusions, which were extremely popular during the Op Art movement of the 1960s, create the feeling that a motionless image is somehow moving. However, Professor Kitaoka posts a caution on his website for anyone who feels sick: ‘Some of the pictures on this website can cause dizziness or might possibly epileptic seizures. ‘The latter happens when the brain can't handle the conflicting information from your two eyes. ‘If you start feeling unwell when using this website, immediately cover one eye with your hand and then leave the page. ‘Do not close your eyes because that can make the attack worse.’ In one image, called Swimming Rings, yellow circles on a purple background appear to move towards each other. Similarly, pink columns of spots on a blue background in the image called Ampan Factory appear to move up and down. Professor Kitaoka’s Button image features rows of circles that look like they’re increasing in size and coming towards the viewer - a similar experience is seen in his Rotating Rays image. In Construction Of A Subway By Rabbits, the inner circle rotates, and in Rollers the screen looks as if it’s a piece of paper being moved up and down. Bulge is the only black and white image in the collection, and it has been designed to look like the central circle is protruding from the background. The most colourful images, known as Autumn Colour Swamp and Primrose Field, resemble the Magic Eye pictures of the 1990s. In the former, squares move around the centre of the image, while the latter looks like a picnic blanket blowing in the wind. Meanwhile, Irrigation looks like rows of seeds being moved through rollers. One of the professor's most recent experiments looks at a basic illusion - how veins appear blue to a human, but, at best, they are actually a very light great on the colour spectrum.

"By . Travelmail Reporter . Hotels in the notorious party resort of Magaluf are set to kick out a record number of yob British holidaymakers this year. Nearly 100 troublemakers have been asked to leave already this season for smashing up rooms, fighting with guests or assaulting staff. And hotel bosses are promising to get even tougher with unruly tourists after the rowdy Majorcan resort made headlines around the world over a video of a British teenager performing a sex act on 24 men in a bar for free booze. Troublemakers: Almost 100 Brits have been thrown out of hotels in Magaluf this year . Party capital: Magaluf has been caught in the spotlight since the video footage emerged (file picture) A local hotel association has revealed 92 of the 107 people members have kicked out so far this year have been British. The other 15 were Irish. The shocking figures put Magaluf on course to break its record of expulsions, 254 last year and up from 147 in 2012 and 166 in 2011. The vast majority of those asked to leave in previous years, like this year, were British. And around 35 per cent of the area's hotels do not belong to the association which released the figures today, meaning the real number is likely to be slightly higher. Joan Espina, vice president of the Palmanova-Magaluf Hotel Association, which covers the two sister resorts, said: ‘The vast majority of the expulsions are down to three reasons. Support: Emergency services workers attend to a tourist who has passed out on a bench on the Punta Ballena strip in Magaluf after a night out . A major events firm has announced it is pulling out of scandal-hit resort Magaluf. Mallorca Rocks said this will be its final summer of running open-air gigs at its eponymous hotel in the party destination. Andy McKay, founder of the firm's owner Ibiza Rocks Group, said: ‘our strategic agenda has changed and the time is right for us to move on at the end of the summer season. ‘We are really proud of what we have brought to the Mallorcan resort of Magaluf but we are pulling out of the resort in September.’ It is understood the decision to cease activity in Magaluf was taken before the furore broke out over footage of a 21-year-old Northern Irish girl performing a sex act on 24 men in a bar. But it is likely to compound fears voiced by nightlife workers of an exodus by big tour operators following the controversy. Managers, DJs, reps and bar staff, most of them British, claim that they have all been tarred with the same brush over the actions of one independent pub crawl organiser. And they complained that local authorities are targeting bars that bring money to Majorca rather than tackling problems such as street prostitution and muggings. ‘The first is guests damaging hotel furniture, kicking doors down, smashing mirrors and even throwing TVs out of their rooms. ‘The others are fights with other guests and verbal and physical attacks on hotel staff. ‘The vast majority are always British men, aged between 18 and 25. ‘We want young people who come to enjoy themselves but within a context of respect towards other guests. ‘We won't tolerate people whose fun comes from antisocial behaviour which causes others to suffer.‘It's got to be fun within certain limits. ‘Virtually . all the problems we're experiencing are connected to the misuse of . drugs and alcohols and obviously we'd urge these youngsters to take . care.’ Troublemakers are put on a temporary black list so hoteliers know not to accept them. Mr . Espina explained: ‘The association sends round an email with the name . of the person that's been expelled so other members are pre-warned. ‘We cover 20,000 hotel beds in Magaluf and Palmanova so it is a very effective measure. ‘It's only information that's kept for a few days and not on a long-term basis. ‘Most . of the people that are expelled for bad behaviour promise they won't do . it again but we usually find a lot of them have already caused trouble . before. ‘Where there's been vandalism hoteliers try to get compensation from those who've caused it but it's very difficult in practice. Drunken: A woman can be seen passed out on a kerb in Magaluf, which has been blighted by scandal . Collapsed: A man lies sprawled on the pavement next to a Magaluf bar as his friend tries to look after him . ‘Usually we try to avoid getting the police involved unless it's very serious.’ Several hotels in the area have hired private security to address the problem. One hotel boss said: ‘It's not that the problem has necessarily got worse but more that hotels are taking a tougher approach. ‘In many cases hotels now employ external security staff rather than depending on a night-time caretaker and a sole security guard they mostly employed themselves.’","Nearly 100 troublemakers have been evicted from Magaluf hotels this year .

And while many associate high medical bills with serious health problems, it is actually everyday illnesses that can cause the biggest problems, with unexpectedly high bills for treatment. An . analysis of claims in the last 12 months by Debenhams travel insurance . shows that bills have almost doubled over the last decade. An average medical claim now costs over £900, rising to just under £1,000 for travellers aged 65 and older, but can shoot up if a hospital stay is necessary. The average non-medical travel insurance claim is less than half of that, at just over £400. The highest medical pay out over the last year was for over £1.5 million. This was for a woman who received treatment after suffering a brain injury in California and was flown home by air ambulance. Necessity: Six million Britons are travelling abroad without insurance, despite the average cost of medical claims doubling to more than £900 . But, surprisingly, the study revealed that the top medical condition for generating claims proved to be Gastroenteritis - which is a stomach bug. While many would dismiss this as a 24 hour inconvenience, it can lead to dehydration and hospitalisation. One holidaymaker who fell ill in America would have faced a whopping £100,000 debt after treatment had they not taken out insurance. The second most common problem was injuries to knees and lower legs, followed by head injuries. 1. Spain;2. Egypt;3. Turkey;4. Greece;5. Cyprus;6. USA;7. France;8. Thailand;9. Bulgaria;10. Mexico. 1. USA2. Canada3. Portugal4. Thailand5. Spain6. Mexico7. South Africa8. UAE9. Australia10. Cyprus . Ear infections were also prevalent, along with heart conditions and allergic reactions, back pain, animal and insect bites. All the apparently minor . ailments could prove costly abroad with an overnight hospital stay in . Spain following an allergic reaction resulting in a £3,000 bill and . treatment for a broken leg in America costing as much as £40,000. Despite rising medical fees around one in four holidaymakers (24 per cent), roughly six million a year, still take the gamble of travelling uninsured, according to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Debenhams Director of Personal Finance, Mike Hazell, said: 'Despite the risks, many holidaymakers still consider travel insurance to be a luxury; this really is one area where it is not worth trying to cut financial corners. Medical treatment abroad, for even the less serious illnesses, can result in very large bills.' Figures from the Association of British Insurers reveal that travel insurers come to the aid of 4,600 people a week needing emergency medical treatment while abroad, at a cost of £4 million a week. The latest industry reports also show that medical costs represented 56 per cent of travel insurance claims in 2012, with the costs relative to claims rising sharply.","Six million Britons failing to take out travel insurance .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Author Zoe Strimpel says Facebook bombards single women with pictures of 'perfect' weddings and babies, which causes envy and voyeurism . Single women should ditch Facebook because the 'perfect lives' of their friends are bad for their health, a relationship expert has warned. Author Zoe Strimpel says the social media site bombards singletons with pictures of 'perfect' weddings and babies which causes envy and voyeurism. She . said: 'What [Facebook] does is it enhances the sense that your life is . lacking and specifically, when you are single, you focus in on all those . pictures of perfect weddings, perfect babies, perfect couples. She urged single women to cut down or get rid of Facebook completely during a lecture at Cambridge’s Festival of Ideas. She . said getting rid of your profile will help 'limit that delicious but . yucky feeling of voyeurism, slight envy, maybe even narcissism.' Ms Strimpel, who wrote ‘Man Diet: One Woman’s Quest to End Bad Romance’, said the fairer sex also spends too much time monitoring potential suitors online. She said the ready availability of biographical information on Facebook encourages women to over-analyse potential dates. 'You become addicted to information that you might not need to know about, say, Joe the musician who you drunkenly snogged at a house warming, but who turns out has a girlfriend. 'Thanks to Facebook you may know his mother’s name, the details of his last holiday, the names of his exes, who he is hanging around with. 'This is not healthy or helpful information, plus it gives the impression that these men are more in your life than they actually are, which is quite corrosive. 'There’s plenty of psychology that supports taking a break from social media.' On a more positive note. The Joy of Sex rewriter Susan Quilliam told the same conference modern women have never had it better in bed. The psychologist, single at 63 after her marriage of 25 years ended, said women are free to enjoy sex - unlike her mother who didn’t know what her clitoris was. Ms Strimpel said the site 'enhances the sense that your life is lacking and specifically, when you are single, you focus in on all those pictures of perfect weddings, perfect babies, perfect couples' (file picture) She said: 'I can, if I so wish, go out and sleep with somebody tonight without opprobrium, without being told I’m a slut. 'Well there are some people who will still think I’m a slut, but largely we are lucky. 'We . are lucky post pill and post the Abortion Act to be able to know and . decide where, what, who, how and also whether and where to look for sex - . and where things are and what to do with them. 'My mother admitted to me she did not know what her clitoris was.' Ms . Strimpel and Ms Quilliam were joined by The Erotic Review founder Rowan . Pelling to discuss ‘How to be a single woman in 2013, whether you’re 25 . or 60’. Explaining the inspiration for her book, Ms Strimpel added: 'I was 28 and I just had broken up with a boyfriend - ""‘Oh my God I’m single, I’d better act single"". She added that the wealth of information available on Facebook encourages women to over-analyse potential dates. 'This is not healthy or helpful information, plus it gives the impression that these men are more in your life than they actually are, which is quite corrosive' 'I’ve got to in some way channel Samantha from Sex and the City. What this meant was seeing a lot of men, most of whom I didn’t particularly like, and going on dates even when I would have preferred to stay in with a cup of tea and a book. 'It meant a lot of drinking, a lot of staying out late and feeling hungover at work, which was horrible. 'It meant telling a lot of funny stories about my capers to my friends, who loved it and they wanted more and more, and spending a lot time worrying about various guys that I don’t even remember now. 'There was fun goodness and yucky badness. For some reason the badness was getting the upper hand.'","Zoe Strimpel says the social media site .

"By . Neil Michael . Severe burns: Elizabeth Soffe was lying in her cot beneath the air condition unit . An air conditioning unit believed to be the cause of a fire that led to an Irish baby nearly being burned to death in a Qatar villa broke down 12 days previously. It has emerged that a complaint was made about the unit in a bedroom of the Doha villa where six-month-old Elizabeth Soffe's Dublin parents were living. In an email to the maintenance workers employed by the owners of the villa - Al Asmakh Real Estate - Elizabeth's mother Sinéad raised her concerns. The unit was seen to by maintenance workers, but it is believed to have broken down again on the day of the fire. What role it played in the May 29 blaze that caused the toddler to suffer 60 per cent burns is currently being investigated. Last night, the company was unavailable for comment. But Mrs Soffe's email shows there were issues with the air conditioning unit, which was based over the cot where her daughter was sleeping when it caught fire. On May 17, her email read: 'The a/c unit in our master bedroom is leaking water. It needs to be fixed as a priority as our small baby sleeps there. Kind regards, Sinéad Soffe.' As a consequence of the complaint – which was one of many maintenance issues at the villa – a worker came out to fix the leak. But tragedy struck on May 29 and Elizabeth suffered horrific injuries in the fire at the villa where there had been a string of maintenance issues months and weeks previously. The Soffe couple, who moved to Qatar three years ago, had to travel to England with Elizabeth four days after the fire so she could receive medical treatment. In last week's Irish Daily Mail her parents detailed the devastating moment when Mrs Soffe discovered her baby on fire, just moments after she had been laid down in her cot. Husband Liam, who works for Doha-based engineering firm Atkins, said his wife patted out flames on Elizabeth's head and chest after she heard the baby's screams. He told the Irish Daily Mail last night about the various maintenance issues they had in their home. Raised concern: Sinéad Soffe, Elizabeth's mother, had raised concerns about the air conditioning unit less than a fortnight before the fire broke out . There was another A/C unit (air conditioning unit) in another room and the on/off switch melted. 'The compound replaced it. The same thing happened with the washing machine, the plug in the socket melted, they replaced that. We also had problems with the electric cooker, where even if you switched it off, it was wired wrong, so one of the rings stayed on.' He added: 'The only two things in the room were the A/C unit and the baby monitor. Because Sinéad heard her crying on the baby monitor we knew it wasn't that.' Rod Stewart, managing director for Atkins in Qatar, said: 'We're a close-knit organisation in Doha and all our people are devastated by Elizabeth's injuries. 'It's a tremendously difficult time for Liam, Sinéad and the family and we're doing what we can to support them, both as a company and a community.' Elizabeth, who is now being treated by specialists in Birmingham Children's Hospital, is going to have to stay in the UK for at least a year. Liam and Sinead – who lost everything in the blaze – have set up a charity to raise £100,000 to care for her and their other three children. The Baby Elizabeth Fund – which is being run through the Youcaring.com website – has so far raised just over £33,500. The family have attracted just under 500 supporters of the fund, a link to which has so far been shared on Facebook 1,400 times. The family are also currently trying to have returned to them €8,400 in rental and deposit cheques which Al Asmakh Real Estate is currently holding on to. Despite the May 29 tragedy, the company cashed the €2,800 June rent cheque four days later. The company, which is owned by one of the Qatar's wealthiest businessmen Ibrahim Al Asmakh, has since promised to return the money. Blaze: The fire took place at this villa, which the Soffe family rented in Doha, Qatar . Following an approach by the Irish Daily Mail, Al Asmakh Real Estate apologised about the June rental cheque having been cashed and promised to make a contribution to the cost of Elizabeth's care. That offer of help has, however, yet to materialise despite a promise from the company's general manager, Fadi Barakeh. Although he said he was too busy to take questions last night, when spoken to previously he said: 'We are more than happy to do everything to help the family in any way we can. 'There's been an unfortunate misunderstanding on the issue of rental cheques. We are determined to help the family and, in the company, this goes all the way to the president Ibrahim Al Asmakh who is following this very closely. Like the rest of us, his sympathies are with the family and Elizabeth and he very much hopes for her safe recovery.' He added: 'We will also facilitate any discussion relating to the issue of insurance. Obviously at this stage, we are unable to pre-empt the outcome of any investigation into what caused this terrible fire. 'But if we are liable in any way, then we will obviously not shirk any responsibilities we have. In the meantime, if there is a contribution we can give towards her Elizabeth's care, then we will be happy to do so.' Donations can be made at youcaring.com/medical-fundraiser/thebaby-elizabeth-fund-/190347. A father who lost his triplets in a fire in Doha two years ago said that he isn’t surprised to hear of Elizabeth Soffe’s appalling injuries. Martin Weekes said last night that medical care was disturbingly backward when his two-year-old daughter, Lillie, and sons Jackson and Willsher died at the Gympanzee day care centre in the Villaggio Shopping Mall on May 28, 2012. ‘Given the appalling state of Qatar emergency care in May 28, 2012, when our three children died, Ithink it is a miracle Elizabeth survived,’ he told the Irish Daily Mail last night. Perished: Lillie, Jackson and Wilshire Weekes were killed in May 2012 at a daycare centre in Doha . ‘When Lillie was being rushed to hospital, paramedics couldn’t give her oxygen because they didn’t have an oxygen mask small enough.’ And when firemen turned up to try and enter the blazing building, they arrived with wooden ladders, he said. A total of 19 people perished in the blaze which was caused by faulty wiring. The walls of the unlicensed nursery had been painted with flammable paint. There was no sprinkler system and inadequate alarms. Five people have since been convicted and sentenced to jail, although they have yet to serve any of their sentence. Qatar’s ambassador to Belgium, Sheikh Ali Bin Jassim Bin Al Thani, and his wife, owners of the Gympanzee centre, received a six-year sentence for causing death by negligence. The couple areappealing their sentences.","Six-month-old Elizabeth Soffe was severely burned at family home in May .

"By . Martin Robinson . The largest warship in the British Navy's fleet and thousands of additional soldiers have arrived in London to ensure security is not breached during 2012 Olympics. Spectators watched on as helicopter carrier HMS Ocean was manoeuvred into its dock at Greenwich, east London, yesterday where it will serve as a mighty military defence and home to service personnel during the Games. Security of the global sporting event has been at the top of London Major Boris Johnson's agenda this week after contractor G4S admitted it needed additional soldiers to plug a 3,500 staffing shortfall. As HMS Ocean turns in the Thames 150 sailors and aircrew recreate the Olympic Rings on the flight deck to mark the start of the ship's Olympic deployment . Britain's helicopter carrier HMS Ocean, the Royal Navy's largest in the fleet, sailed into Greenwich, East London, yesterday, as it prepares to anchor on the River Thames for the Olympics security . It was a careful operation to manoeuvre the vast vessel into position on the river, where it will be used during the Olympic Games as a base for helicopters and military personnel . People looked on as the unusually large vessel was guided by tugs down the Thames with the city backdrop behind it . Spectacular site: The enormous helicopter carrier HMS Ocean towers over residential flats in east London, close to the Isle of Dogs . The largest British warship travelled under London's newest transport system yesterday, the east London cable car, as it journeyed up the Thames . Boris has put the ongoing Olympic . security shambles down to 'pre-curtain-up jitters' and believes the . public will be pleased to see thousands of extra armed soldiers guarding . the Games. The Mayor of London said yesterday . the city is the best-prepared host ever and the 3,500 forces staff . brought in to plug a gap left by the failure of G4S to find enough staff . will ensure London 2012 is safe. G4S was reportedly paid a staggering . £284million to provide up to 17,500 personnel for the 2012 Games, but . this week admitted it couldn't do it with only a fortnight to go until . the opening ceremony. David Cameron today said: 'If . companies don’t deliver on their contracts then they should be pursued . for that money', in an attack on the beleaguered security firm. Their blunders mean thousands of soldiers – some only just back . from gruelling tours on the Afghan front line – have been ordered to . cancel home leave or holidays with their friends and families to form a ring of steel at Games venues. Ready for action: A fearsome Lance Corporal - who cannot be named for security reasons -  a trained sniper with the a high-ranking regiment, shows what he will be doing throughout the Games . Deadly: These troops and thousands more will use all their specialist training to deal with threats at London 2012 . In action: The pair will be two of thousands who will be in Britain aiming to ensure that London 2012 is safe from terror attacks . Experts: Snipers will leave their base at RAF Northolt by helicopter to protect London 2012 from above . Mr . Johnson today added his backing saying the Army would add 'tone' to the . Games as they do at the Wimbledon tennis championships where they . control crowds. 'I . think we are in the stage now of pre-curtain-up jitters and you would . expect the media, quite properly, to be focusing on all the areas where . people feel there may be imperfections or things we need to nail down . and clearly transport and security have always been the big question . marks,' Mr Johnson said.

'But . I’m very confident that at this stage London is better prepared for the . Olympics than any previous Olympic city has ever been.' Asked if G4S had his . confidence, he said: “I think the Games are going to be very safe, very . secure and the arrangements that are going to be made by G4S, by the . Armed Services, will deliver very good results. 'We . have increased the number of people who will be involved and I think . anybody who goes to Wimbledon and sees the role of the Armed Services in . venue security, making the thing run well, will like it.

'The facilities are built, the country is ready, we are in really good shape.' It came as it also emerged hundreds of . A-level students have been hired as front-line guards at the Games to . fill the security void when the games starts in two weeks. They are among 3,300 teenagers recruited from colleges around Britain to help form a ring of steel at the venues for £8.50 an hour.

Security experts expressed alarm that youngsters aged 18 and 19 had been entrusted with searching spectators and bags. The company was contracted to provide a minimum of 15,400 security staff, with a target of 17,500. This week the Government confirmed the call-up of 3,500 extra troops, G4S claimed it would be able to bring in 13,800.

Originally Locog contracted G4S to provide 2,000 . security guards, but in December the firm agreed to increase that number . massively. But locals are expected to be reassured by the presence of very sever anti-terrorist measures around the Olympic site. Soldiers in residential tower blocks . and green open spaces were yesterday pictured installing surface-to-air . missiles at six sites across the capital, a show of strength not seen in . this country since the Second World War.

"By . Joshua Gardner . An 89-year-old Washington State shop owner fearlessly used a golf club to fend off a robber who entered her store Sunday morning armed with a 3-foot samurai sword. Miyo Koba had never faced a robber in her 60 years as owner of Frank's Market in Moses Lake, but handled her first such encounter like a seasoned pro, at least after she ruled out stabbing the man. Before the 5 wood club, Koba tried threatening him with a sharp pair of scissors. Not having it: 89-year-old Moses Lake, Washington shop owner Miyo Koba stands in her store holding the 5 wood golf club she used to fend off a samurai sword wielding attacker who robbed her store on Sunday morning . Brave: The attacker came in demanding Miyo open the register. She refused and says she was emboldened by the false belief her attacker's 3-foot sword was just a toy . 'I had the scissors in my hand like this,' she said as she demonstrated her threatening stance to KREM. She said the robber demanded she open the register and that he at some point knocked her down. 'I didn't have the nerve to stab him,' admitted Koba, who nonetheless was under the false impression his sword was just a toy. 'I didn't feel threatened.  It just probably made me a little bit more brave,' she told KREM. While on the floor, the plucky lady snatched a nearby golf club and started swinging. Sharp lady: Koba first grabbed a pair of scissors, which she brandished at the robber but was hesitant to stab him. Instead, she grabbed a golf club--but not before he pushed her to the ground . Thwomp! Koba first swung at the robber's head, but missed. So she whacked him in the legs before he ran off with her cash register . 'I got into a sitting position and I found the club so I went tried to swing this club at him and I tried to hit his head a couple times but I couldn't reach it,' said Koba, who then went for his legs where she landed some blows. The wounded robber managed to make it out of the store with the cash register, which was recovered later by police along with the robbers clothing and shoes. Police say he was riding a BMX style bike as he fled. 'He must have been running around in his underwear and no shoes because that's what they said, they found all his clothes,' said Koba. Thankfully, Koba was unharmed and had her register returned by police.","Miyo Koba of Moses Lake, Washington was threatened with a samurai sword on Sunday by the first robber she faced in 60 years as a shop owner .

"By . Chris Greenwood . A trial is to be held entirely in secret for the first time in British history. Two men accused of a terror plot will go into the dock at the Old Bailey in weeks. For undisclosed reasons of national security their identities, as well as details of their alleged crimes, will not be heard in public. The very existence of the trial can be disclosed today only because the Daily Mail fought with other media groups to have the reporting restrictions lifted. Two men accused of a terror plot will go into the dock at the Old Bailey, pictured, within in weeks - but their identity and alleged crimes will not be made public due to undisclosed reasons of national security . The casting aside of the centuries-old doctrine of open courts sparked anger last night. ‘To hold trials entirely in secret is an outrageous assault on the fundamental principles of British justice,’ said Clare Algare of Reprieve. ‘This Government’s dangerous obsession with secret courts seems to know no bounds. Unless it is resisted, we risk ending up with a justice system that will not be worthy of the name.’ Keith Vaz, Labour chairman of the Commons home affairs committee, said: ‘For a parliamentary democracy with our reputation for a fair legal system, this sets a very dangerous precedent. ‘For an entire trial to be heard in camera, this is unprecedented, very serious and worrying.’ The Court of Appeal was urged by the media groups’ lawyer to restrict the secrecy order because it represented a ‘totally unprecedented departure from the principles of open justice’. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling insisted it was a 'matter for the courts' but stressed sitting in secret should be 'very, very rare indeed'. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'The default in our justice system should be transparency, we should not see situations where a large amount of the process in our courts system suddenly becomes secret. 'But the law does allow very rare occasions where trials or parts of trials can take place in private. This is always a matter for the judges. 'But what I would say is I know our senior judiciary well, I know they will want to protect the interests of justice and I'm very confident that if they take a decision on a difficult matter like this they will be doing so in the interests of justice.' The existence of the Old Bailey trial has only come to light because the Mail and other media groups have campaigned for reporting restrictions to be lifted . Lord Justice Gross, Mr Justice Simon and Mr Justice Burnett said they would make a decision within days. The Mail has campaigned to expose the threat to democracy and openness that secret courts represent. There has been huge controversy around closed family courts, super injunctions and civil cases involving national security. Prior to yesterday, the media was banned from even reporting that the trial of the two men, known only as AB and CD, was due to take place in conditions of total secrecy. AB is accused of ‘engaging in conduct in preparation for terrorist acts’. Both men are accused of possessing terrorist documents, including a file named ‘bomb making’ held on a memory stick. CD faces a fourth charge under immigration laws of improperly obtaining a British passport. Chairman of the Commons home affairs committee Keith Vaz said the 'serious and worrying' move set a 'very dangerous precedent' Senior prosecutors claim the trial may not go ahead if it has to be held in public. But they have refused to disclose publicly the need for total secrecy. Anthony Hudson, representing the media organisations, branded this position ‘unreasonable’ and ‘unrealistic’. He said national security should not be pursued without regard for the values of the society it is trying to protect. ‘This appeal raises important issues relating to not only the constitutional principle of open justice, but also the equally important principle of fairness and natural justice,’ he added. ‘This case is a test of the court’s commitment to that constitutional principle in the admittedly difficult and sensitive cases where the state seeks to have trials involving terrorism heard in secret and relies in support of that on the grounds of national security. ‘It is unprecedented that the trial of two defendants charged with serious terrorism offences should take place entirely in private with the identities of both defendants withheld. ‘No order has ever been made which requires an entire criminal trial to be held in private, with the media excluded and defendants anonymous.’ Commenting on the case, Shami Chakrabarti of Liberty said transparency was not ‘an optional luxury in the justice system’. She added: ‘This case is a worrying high water mark for secrecy in our courts. ‘There must be clearer explanations before the door is shut on press and public.’ Criminal cases are heard in open courts which the public and media can attend. Reporting restrictions sometimes cover specific parts of cases, but no previous trial has been held entirely in secret. The Official Secrets Act enables cases to be heard behind closed doors but the legislation is rarely used in this way. Liberty Director Shami Chakrabarti was also critical of the move, saying transparency was not 'an optional luxury in the justice system' The power to hold a trial in secret comes from common law and is not covered by recent terrorist legislation. Richard Whittam QC, who will prosecute the two men, said the Crown Prosecution Service supported open justice. But he said ‘exceptional circumstances’ had led to the request for secrecy. In 2008, the Old Bailey heard parts of a murder trial in secret on grounds of national security. But the defendant, Wang Yam, who battered recluse Allan Chappelow to death, was named and most of the case was heard in public. The trial of Britain’s most notorious double agent, George Blake, was held partly in secret in the early 1960s. Charged under the Official Secrets Act, he was sentenced to 42 years for passing secrets to the Soviets. The Mail has campaigned to expose the threat to democracy and openness that secret courts represent . Last year, the president of the Supreme Court launched a stinging attack on secret justice, saying it is ‘not justice at all’. Lord Neuberger said hearing evidence behind closed doors was ‘against the principle of justice’. He said that other than in exceptional circumstances judges should treat requests to hear cases in closed courts with ‘distaste and concern’. His comments came after a bitter row over Government plans to introduce the Justice and Security Act. This formally enshrined secret hearings and judgments in the legal system, a radical departure from centuries of tradition.

"By . Andrew Levy . Any magician worth his salt must master sleight of hand. But when Amit Gadhia, an in-store entertainer at Harrods, abused his talents to pilfer cash, he wasn’t quite clever enough. Gadhia, 35, saw his opportunity after being moved to a job on the cheese counter...using one hand to slip money from the till and the other to conceal it. Magic: Amit Gadhia used his sleight of hand skills to steal money while working at the Harrods food hall . His deception was revealed because the . day’s takings didn’t match sales that had been rung up and he confessed . when confronted by staff. Now Gadhia could be about to perform a vanishing act, after magistrates warned he faced a jail term for stealing about £70. Gadhia will first have to explain his . actions to his parents, with whom he lives in Enfield, North London. They knew nothing about his crime until they were contacted by the Daily . Mail yesterday. His father, Rajni, 60, said:  ‘I thought he had gone to . work as  normal this morning when he left. I didn’t know he was going . to court.’ Gadhia worked at the Knightsbridge store for two and a half years before he was caught. Originally an entertainer, he . performed magic tricks for customers who were then encouraged to buy . packs of cards and other paraphernalia. He moved to the food hall after a . position became available and was placed on the cheese counter. But he was stopped by staff on January . 2 after questions were raised about missing takings. When he was . searched by staff he was also found to be carrying cocaine. Caught: The 35-year-old was also found with cocaine when he was confronted and searched by staff . Prosecutor Tom Gill told Hammersmith . Magistrates’ Court, in West London: ‘The defendant worked at Harrods on . the cheese counter, dealing with members of the public and taking money . for transactions. ‘He was designated a particular till and it was noted there were small amounts of cash going missing. ‘The defendant was previously a . magician within the store and used his talent to take money with one . hand and secrete it with the other.’ Gadhia, who is divorced and has no . children, admitted to police he had taken between £1 and £20 on . different occasions in the lead-up to Christmas. Catherine Newey, defending, said her . client had run into financial difficulties after his parents’ home was . burgled and he contributed a ‘significant amount’ towards a security . system. Employee: Gadhia previously worked as an entertainer at the department store before moving to the food hall . She added: ‘He simply had no money to . get the basics and was tempted by the opportunity that arose.’ Gadhia, . who was cautioned for theft in 2011, admitted theft and possessing a . controlled drug. He was unavailable for comment after . the hearing but his father, who was born in Kenya but is of Indian . heritage, said the caution involved a previous burglary at the family . home when he and his wife, Hansa, 56, were on holiday. Mr Gadhia, who . works in retail, said his son removed other items from the house ‘so . that I could claim more’. The father of three added: ‘I don’t know why he does these stupid things. It’s not like we’re not comfortable. ‘He pays me £500 a month because he lives with us but I could have helped if he was in trouble.’ Gadhia is due to return to court on Monday to be sentenced.","Amit Gadhia used his sleight of hand skills to steal around £70 .

"By . Liz  Hull . Updated: . 20:39 EST, 30 November 2011 . When villagers searching for a missing cat heard frantic miaowing from a recycling bin, they thought the runaway had been found. But their efforts to free the cat, which was due to give birth any moment, became increasingly desperate as the lock on the clothing bin was broken and couldn’t be opened. After the fire brigade and RSPCA’s attempts also failed, the worried villagers had it loaded on to a truck and driven to a specialist engineering firm 20 miles away. Miaow!: Rescuers spent 12 hours trying to get this squeaky toy cat out of a clothes bank, thinking it was a real cat . There, steel saws were used to gain access and the mewing prisoner was revealed – as nothing more than a squeaky toy. Kelvin Owen, who owns the engineering . firm, said: ‘Once we got into the bin we heard the miaowing – it sounded . just like a cat and we all started to carefully search the bags. ‘Then I found a bag of toys and picked . out a toy. I said: “It couldn’t be this, could it?” As I held it it . went “miaow, miaow”. Mystery solved!’ The 12-hour drama unfolded in the . seaside village of Moelfre, near Anglesey, North Wales, as a pregnant . stray cat was being taken to a foster home by an animal charity worker. As the animal was being dropped off . she escaped. Villagers were alerted to be on the lookout for the cat but . it wasn’t until three days later that miaowing was heard from the . clothes bin. Missing: Puss Puss, the pregnant cat rescuers thought was stuck in the recycling bin . ‘By this time we thought the cat had been in there for three days,’ said Jasmine Hazlehurst, from animal charity Anglesey Pets. ‘We were worried she could have had . the kittens and was trapped, without much air supply or food, so we were . desperate to get her out. I did feel embarrassed when they pulled out . the stuffed cat. ‘People were laughing, it was a . priceless moment. I’m not that familiar with Disney toys but I’m told it . is Marie from the Aristocats. She makes a miaowing sound that is very . realistic when you touch her paw. My five-year-old daughter Naomi has . been playing with her ever since.’ The pregnant cat is still missing. ‘Cats have a way of getting into people’s homes and hearts, so we are . just hoping someone is feeding and looking after her,’ said Mrs . Hazlehurst.

"By . Richard Spillett . A spectacular country estate designed by Capability Brown, Britain's 'greatest gardener', has come on the market for £5.75million. But if the new owner wants a stately home to match the grandeur of the huge parkland, they will have to build it themselves, as the last one was demolished after the grounds fell into disrepair. Historic Redgrave Park, near Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, dates back to the Doomsday Book and a magnificent mansion was built there in 1545. The Redgrave Park estate, near Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, has gone up for sale for nearly £6million but has no stately home due to the mansion being demolished after the Second World War . Redgrave Hall was built in the 16th century before its owners brought in famous gardener Capability Brown to design the grounds in the late 18th century . But Redgrave Hall fell into a state of neglect and after the Second World War, when Britain was virtually bankrupt, it was demolished due to a lack of money to repair it. The footings and foundations remain today and planning experts believe obtaining permission to build a new hall in its place would be a formality. It could cost an extra three million pounds to build but the value of the whole estate would then be worth more than 10 million pounds. The parkland was landscaped by Capability Brown in the 1760s. He remodelled the estate, most notably turning a small stream into a 44 acre lake and planting clumps of oak trees. Redgrave is one of about 170 parklands design by Brown in Britain. It has been owned by Guy and Jill Topham for the last 40 years. The couple converted a large stable block on the grounds into a six-bedroom cottage where they live today. The estate includes a six-bedroom cottage which was built by converting the park's stables, but sellers say getting permission to build a larger mansion should be easy . The estate, pictured in 1907, comes with 100,000sq ft of agricultural buildings, 142 acres of arable farmland  and 77 acres of woodland . Brown, real name Lancelot, got his nickname from his habit of telling prospective clients that their grounds had 'great capabilities'. Before his time, gardens were formal exercises in geometry; walled in, topiaried, criss-crossed by straight paths, everything intended to show man’s control of nature. Brown abolished walls and introduced curved paths and flowerbeds. The word at the time was 'landscape', the idea that country houses were part of the landscape and you should see no boundary between the grounds and the surrounding countryside. Nearing . retirement, the Tophams are selling the estate that comes with the . cottage, boat house and a Grade II listed folly that can easily be lived . in. It . has 100,000sq ft of agricultural buildings which are currently hired . out for storage, 142 acres of arable farmland, 173 acres of grassland . and 77 acres of woodland. Despite . the huge size of the estate - the equivalent of 814 football pitches - . the agents selling it claim it is 'perfectly manageable'. William Hargreaves, of estate agents Savills, said: 'The vendors maintain the estate themselves using tractors and mowers. They aren't daunted by looking after 460 acres, it is perfectly manageable. 'From a farming point of view, it isn't very big. It is predominantly parkland and it isn't that labour intensive.' Redgrave began life as a medieval deer park in 1211 when the Abbot of Bury St Edmunds had a hunting lodge there. The imposing hall was built in the 16th century before the estate was bought by Sir John Holt, the then Lord Chief Justice, in the 1702. It was his great-nephew who had the estate redesigned by Capability Brown 70 years later. It remained in the Holt family until 1971 when the Tophams bought it. Mr Hargreaves said: 'The Tophams spent the majority of their time looking after it and making changes. 'There is quite an extensive range of agricultural buildings that form a business for storing agricultural produce. 'The resurrection of Redgrave Hall is perhaps the only project not undertaken by the current owners. 'The hall was requisitioned during the war and was used to billet . British and American military personnel. The gardens became a . wilderness. 'After the war the then owner decided to demolish the hall to raise money to plough into the estate. The contents were sold and the house itself was taken down brick by brick. The footings are still there. 'Our . planning department has carried out an assessment of the site and . concluded it may be possible, subject to planning consent, to reinstate . the hall. 'The opportunity to buy a Capability Brown property just doesn't happen very often.' It is estimated that it would cost an extra three million pounds to build a new mansion on the site but a new property would boost the value of the estate . The parkland was landscaped by Capability Brown in the 1760s. He remodelled the estate, turning a small stream into a lake and planting a number of oak trees .","Estate in Suffolk whose grounds were re-modelled by the famous 18th century gardener goes on the market .

"By . Sean O'hare . Iran successfully launched a live monkey into space last week, the government said today. There is no independent confirmation of the achievement and there have been . no announcements by Western powers of any Iranian launch late last week. The monkey was said to have returned 'intact', an achievement the Iranians celebrated as an advance in a missile and space programme that has given the West and Israel cause for concern. Scroll down for video . The monkey was put into what appeared to be a child's safety seat before entering the space shuttle . The monkey was said to have been sent up in a Kavoshgar rocket that climbed to a height of more than 75 miles before returning. In 2011, President Mahmoud . Ahmadinejad unveiled the space capsule designed to carry the live monkey . into space but that attempt was reported to have failed. At . the time, Fazeli touted the launch of a large animal into space as the . first step towards sending a man into space, which Tehran says is . scheduled for 2020. Iran sent small animals into space - a rat, turtles and worms - aboard its Kavoshgar-3 rocket in 2010. Claims: Al-Alam said the monkey was 'alive' after travelling to an altitude of 75 miles for a sub-orbital flight as part of 'preparations for sending a man into space,' which is scheduled for 2020 . Iran has sent small animals into space - a rat, turtles and worms - in 2010. In September, Iran suggested it may also launch Persian cats into space .

The space race really gathered speed in November 1957 when Russia sent Laika the dog into orbit aboard the Soviet Sputnik 2 spacecraft.

One of over a . dozen chimpanzees trained by the U.S. to beat the Soviet Union’s attempt . to win the space race, Ham made history as the Cold . War extended into orbit. As . the Russians moved closer to sending a human into space, the Americans . decided to use three-year-old Ham — in a style reminiscent of a . gas-detecting canary in a mine — to find out whether humans would be . able to survive in such conditions.

This was because NASA reportedly wanted to avoid bad publicity should a named and therefore humanised animal be killed. Originally . from Cameroon in Africa, and once a star attraction for a Florida zoo, . Ham was added to the astro-chimp team in the United States Air Force to . go into space. The difference between Ham and the Russian dogs, which were preferred by the Soviets because of their ability to sit still for longer periods, was that he would not only go up into space, but also come down again safely.","Monkey sent up on a Kavoshgar rocket last week, local TV reported .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Britain's booming property market has trigged the biggest surge in house building for more than a decade. Construction activity has grown for the last 15 months and firms are now hiring staff at the fastest level since an industry survey began in April 1997. However, the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply warned that growth could be curtailed in the coming months by suppliers struggling to keep pace and the 'sharpest deterioration in the quality of subcontracted work since 1999'. Construction activity has grown for the last 15 months, recording figures above 50 (or no change) in the Markit/CIPS survey . The home building market grew at its steepest level since November 2003, driven by strong demand for new housing projects, according to July data from the Markit/CIPS UK Construction PMI report. Overall, the index edged down to 62.4, down from 62.6 in June, but activity remained well above the 50 level that divides growth from contraction and was above City expectations of 62. Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, said: 'July's figures suggest the UK construction sector is enjoying its strongest cyclical upswing since the global financial crisis, while a new record rise in employment highlights that construction firms are increasingly confident about the sustainability of the upturn.' The report showed that civil engineering activity lifted sharply in July, while commercial construction also rose but at a slower rate than in June. David Noble, chief executive of the CIPS, said: 'The house building sector is racing ahead this quarter with the fastest growth in construction of homes for over a decade. 'The industry as a whole continued its impressive growth, dipping slightly from last month's high.' But he added: 'One concern however, is the strain on supply chains that could become a roadblock to sustained growth in the future. 'Construction firms reported the sharpest deterioration in the quality of subcontracted work since 1999, which combined with lengthening supplier delivery times could conspire to put the brakes on the sector's growth. 'But there's evidence that firms are starting to look beyond in demand sub-contractors and instead further boost their own staffing levels, which goes some way to explaining the record rise in employment levels.' Housing minister Brandon Lewis said the construction industry was 'bouncing back' and hiring at record levels . Housing minister Brandon Lewis said: 'The last administration's housing crash led to the loss of a quarter of a million construction jobs - so I'm pleased to see from these figures that the industry is bouncing back, with hiring at record levels.' Mr Lewis added that, due to the government's Help to Buy scheme, almost 40,000 households have now become homeowners, which has helped building increase to its highest level since 2007. He added that since Help to Buy was introduced last September, it has led to a 34 per cent increase in private housebuilding during the first year of the scheme.","Construction activity has now grown for the 15 consecutive months .

"By . Stephanie Linning . This south west London home can be seen in everything from TV adverts to photos on luxury design websites - and LuLu has even lounged on the garden furniture. And though you would probably not recognise the . stylish sofas or clean white walls, the homeowner makes up to £1200 a day . handing over the keys to directors and photographers who have used his house for hundreds of shoots. Now for the first time, theatre producer James Tod has opened his front door to reveal Britain's most-photographed home - his four-floor terraced townhouse in South Lambeth, London. Scroll down for video . Popular location: Theatre producer James Tod, pictured in his sleek and modern kitchen, owns the four-floor terraced townhouse in south west London which has featured in hundreds of shoots . Blank canvas: A spokesperson from the location agency explained that the house's white walls, bright colours and amazing natural light make it perfect for magazine shoots like this one of Lulu . Since signing up to a locations agency seven years ago, Mr Tod has had celebrities draped over his garden furniture and babies crawling on the carpet - sometimes as many as three times a week. Advertisers and TV executives spend a day filming or photographing inside for projects as varied as computer game adverts to glossy celebrity magazines. They often transform the two-bedroom home is into an unrecognisable studio in less than 12 hours, before repainting the walls and turning it back into the house Mr Tod left in the morning. MR Tod, 46, said: 'It’s bizarre when you’re watching the telly or flicking through a magazine suddenly you think, oh blimey that’s my living room. 'Sometimes they’ll put wallpaper up for just a day but it all gets put back - you just have to be very relaxed about what happens when you’re out of the house!' The lower-ground floor of James’s home has a huge open plan living space and double doors onto a garden that has hosted photo shoots for LuLu. Exotic: The agency said that Mr Tod's beautiful garden, pictured, is a huge draw for shoot directors looking for locations. The owner said that coming home in the middle of his home's first shoot was a real shock . Natural beauty: With some simple white garden furniture - and TV presenter Rachel De Thame - the London garden is transformed for a bright and bold magazine shoot . City chic: One of Mr Tod's pieces of furniture was brought outside for LuLu to lounge on when she posed for this photo, right, that was printed as part of a glossy magazine spread . Upstairs, there’s a kitchen where a food company spent hours photographing bacon sandwiches and there are two bedrooms and space for styling and quick changes. 'Getting it right for shoots and making it a home at the same time has been a challenge - you’ve got to have enough interesting furniture and art to perk up the white walls. 'The first two or three times we had a shoot I was left in shock - the volume of stuff they bring with them is incredible. We once had ten sofas in our living room plus camera crews and stylists. 'I’ve had them paint the walls and move everything around so it’s barely recognisable more times than I can remember. Bright and airy: Directors and photographers often transform the two-bedroom home is into an unrecognisable studio in less than 12 hours, before repainting the walls and turning it back into the house Mr Tod left . Looks familiar: Mr Tod's living space, pictured at the back of this image, had a handful of accessories added to it for this photo shoot, but it has sometimes hosted as many as 10 couches and dozens of soft furnishings . Pretty in pink: Bright, textured accessories and subtle purple flowers are used to add warmth to Mr Tod's neutral living space in this photograph from a magazine shoot . Young guests: Sometimes it is just glimpses of Mr Tod's much-photographed home that can be seen in photos or adverts, as with the two pictured above. The house's natural light means it is an easy place for photographers to shoot . 'They always paint it back though so I’m sure there are 50 layers of the same paint colour on the walls. 'When there are celebrities shooting in the house and I’ve occasionally been working from home it’s been a real eye-opener. 'Most people have been very gracious and unassuming but you very quickly get to know when some with an attitude is in and it is diva central. 'Although I live in a pretty minimal way I still have to work to keep the house in pretty good nick. Distinctive rugs: Directors and photographers often bring their own additional touches, like these rugs, to transform the way the South Lambeth home looks in pictures . Prints and patterns: Advertising executives using the house often cover the walls in wallpaper to create variation in their images, like in the ones pictured above. They later strip the house after the shoot . Caught on camera: An advert featuring Mr Tod's house. He said that it is bizarre when he is watching the television or flicking through a magazine and comes across a photo of his living room . 'When people come to look round - it’s like an inspection from the school matron! 'Thankfully 1st Option [the location agency he registered with] has been really helpful - they always let us know when someone will be coming round so we’re prepared. 'And the house is redecorated every couple of years to make sure it’s bang on trend. We’ve got to give all those photographers and directors a new back drop!” A 1st Option spokesperson said: 'We’ve been representing locations for stills and filming shoots for over 10 years and for the most part clients either want a blank canvas white location and they’ll decorate and prop according to their needs or then they want a location they can walk into and shoot. Classic colour: Mr Tod's home features a number of white walls and pieces of furniture, allowing designers and directors to add their own pops of colour - like the pink cushions featured above - when they arrive for a shoot . A-list guests: Since signing up to a location agency seven years ago, Mr Tod's home has had celebrities draped over its garden furniture, pictured, and photogenic babies crawling along the carpet . Understated elegance: Mr Tod's garden, right, and an upstairs space in his home, left, as seen in photos taken from shoots. He said that he has to keep his decor updated and interesting without being too distinctive . 'This home works well as a shoot location because of the variety it offers, lots of bright colours, good natural light and a fabulous garden. 'A flexible owner always helps, James is very easy going and lets clients get on with their shoot, he allows decorating shoots and has had multiple day shoots allowing wallpapering, painting, blinds and curtains to be put up. The client then re-instates to the way it was after their shoot. 'While we’re always looking for new shoot locations, we’re very particular about what we represent, the key elements are good natural light and space. 'If you’ve got a large traditional or modern house or apartment with nice features, wooden / parquet flooring, large bay / sash windows, traditional fireplaces, large open plan kitchen with island get in touch and we’ll let you know if we think we can get you work.'","Theatre producer James Tod owns four-floor terraced townhouse .

But one neighbour, who didn't want to be named, said: 'There was definitely a lot of lightning around last night. Some of the claps of thunder sounded like they were directly overhead. 'One of the firefighters told us they believed it was caused by a lightning strike. We don't see what else it could be because the property is empty so nobody would have been there.' Manchester Airport said an electrical surge caused by thunderstorms had led to some delays today. General duty manager Gary Brown said: 'It impacted on some lifts and baggage systems but most systems are now back up and running. We'll wait to see what happens this afternoon when we're expecting thunder.' Patients on a hospital ward had to be moved when heavy rain brought down part of a ceiling. Twenty-seven patients on the cardiology ward at the Royal United Hospital in Bath, Somerset, were transferred after the incident at around 2am.Three ceiling panels came down in the hospital's catheter lab and cardiology ward after the roof sprang a leak. The patients, who were all unharmed, were taken to other parts of the hospital. A hospital spokesman said: 'At about 2am, in one of the severe heavy storms we had last night across the South West, there was a leak sprung in the roof of the hospital. 'Water got into the roof, causing three of the ceiling panels to come down due to the weight of the water. 'We had to transfer 27 patients from the cardiology ward to other parts of the hospital. They were not injured but they were inconvenienced and we apologise for that.' The leak has now been plugged and it is hoped that the patients will soon be able to return to the ward, the spokesman added. A spokeswoman for South Western Ambulance Service said an officer attended the hospital at 2.50am to liaise with medics but no further assistance was required.

"By . Becky Barrow . The first evidence emerged yesterday that the blistering pace of house price rises in many parts of Britain, particularly London, is grinding to a halt. A report, from the Halifax, said house prices have fallen in three of the last four months, dropping in March, April and June. If there had not been a sharp jump in May of four per cent, the average house price, currently £183,462, would currently be lower than it was last winter. A report, from the Halifax, said house prices have fallen in three of the last four months, dropping in March, April and June . A separate report, published today by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, said its research clearly points to ‘some moderation in the positive trend.’ There is ‘more buyer caution’, it said, particularly an ‘increased air of caution’ in London with fewer people showing an interest in buying a home. Estate agents said the cooling off is driven by recent interventions by the Bank of England and the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. On 26 April, new rules, introduced by the FCA, made the process of getting a mortgage much more torturous, with rigorous checks about everything that homebuyers spend their money on. To add to the pressure on the housing market, the Bank’s new rules limit how many people will be allowed to borrow 4.5 times or more of their salary when taking out a loan. There is also the imminent prospect of the first interest rate rise for seven years, although the Bank insists that the increases will be ‘limited and gradual’. The latest figures from the Bank clearly point to a slowdown in the number of people who are managing to get a mortgage to buy a house. In January, around 76,000 people got a house purchase loan. By May, it had fallen to just under 62,000 a month. Estate agents said the cooling off is driven by recent interventions by the Bank of England and the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority . An agent, from Doncaster, said: ‘There has been a very noticeable decrease in meaningful activity. ‘The so-called property bubble never reached this area and this year we have not sold one property over the initial asking price.’ One estate agent, from Kings Lynn, Norfolk, said: ‘The talk of interest rate increases and the stricter conditions on mortgages is limiting demand.’ Another agent, from Exeter, said: ‘The new mortgage rules are creating significant hold-ups in processing some mortgage applications.’ One agent, from Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, said: ‘The mortgage affordability rule changes and the possibility of interest rate rises has definitely dampened demand.’ Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at RICS, said: ‘Rhetoric from key officials at the Bank, including the governor Mark Carney, alongside the consequences of the introduction of the mortgage changes, are already slowing momentum, particularly in London.’ Britain’s housing market has never been more divided with a gulf of over £200,000 between a home in the capital and one outside London, according to the Nationwide. For the first time, the average price of a home in London has gone above £400,000 although this huge sum will buy only a tiny studio flat or a garage in many areas. Last week’s report, from the Nationwide, the country’s biggest building society, said the gap is ‘the widest that it has ever been’.","A report from the Halifax showed drops in March, April and June .

"By . Sam Webb . Lee Stephens swore at, punched and spat at police and paramedics after crashing his car while drunk . A vicar crashed his car while three times over the drink-drive limit - then attacked police officers and paramedics. Lee Stephens also told them he was a member of the IRA and threatened to murder them. The 31-year-old collided head on with a family's Ford C-Max car in Billericay, Essex, leaving a father and his two young children, aged five and six, in hospital. Stephens then punched a paramedic, spat at a police officer and assaulted a female paramedic as she treated him. The chaos continued at Basildon Hospital where Stephens told police he had contacts in the IRA and they would 'blow them up'. He then shouted at a police officer, accusing him of having sex with his sister. It was revealed in court the officer's sister had died just weeks earlier. Stephens, of  Armagh, Northern Ireland, was working at Elim Pentecostal Church in Ingatestone at the time. He was sentenced to 16 weeks in prison, suspended for 12 months when he appeared at Basildon Magistrates' Court on Friday. The drama started after Stephens was thrown out The Forge Pub in The Pantiles, Billericay. He crashed his car in to a lamp post before smashing  into the family's car. The court heard he was arrested by an off-duty police officer and a breath test showed he had 108 microgrammes of alcohol in his breath per 100ml. The legal limit is 35 microgrammes. When ambulance crews arrived to treat Stephens and the injured family he became aggressive and swore at them, before punching Sgt Mark Ammon twice in the leg. He then spat at another officer and punched paramedic Gary Harvey in the kidneys. Stephens said: 'I am a pastor, let me go or you will lose your jobs. I will kill everyone, I know the IRA.' Sam Doyle, prosecuting, told the court the children involved in the crash suffered whiplash and are now too scared to get in a car because they think they will die. Stephens, of Armagh, Northern Ireland, was working at Elim Pentecostal Church in Ingatestone at the time . Stephens admitted assault, assaulting a police officer, common assault, failing to provide a specimen of blood and using threatening words and behaviour. He was ordered to pay his victims a total of £250 compensation The court heard that Stephens was on antidepressants following stress at work and did not usually drink. He told the court he did not remember any of the incident and was deeply ashamed. Chair of the bench, Balbira Bal, said: 'Emergency service staff try to help the public and should be given respect and consideration.' Threat: He also told police officers at Basildon Hospital he would 'blow them up'. Stephens was sentenced to 16 weeks in prison, suspended for 12 months when he appeared at Basildon Magistrates' Court (pictured) The Elim Pentecostal Church today confirmed Stephens had been sacked after they were told of his actions. However, it emerged the shamed minister had not confessed to his sins and senior church ministers only became aware of what had happened after media enquiries. A spokesman said: 'The Elim Church was saddened to hear of the events surrounding the prosecution of Lee Stephens. 'Naturally the Church cannot accept such behaviour and Lee Stephens is no longer a minister with Elim. 'We understand that this was out of character and he is totally contrite and apologises for his behaviour. 'Our sympathies go to the family involved in the accident and to the officer and paramedic concerned.'","Lee Stephens crashed into family car after being thrown out of pub .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A married crime scene investigator looking into the death of a real estate developer’s wife had an affair with a fellow detective, she dramatically admitted to the murder trial jury. Detective Anna Howell, who was the lead CSI investigator in the 2007 death of Eleonora Kaufman, 33, admitted that she had an affair with Detective Anthony Angula. He is the lead detective on the case, in which Adam Kaufman is accused of strangling his wife. Scroll Down for Video . Admission: Detective Anna Howell, left, who was the lead CSI investigator in the death of Eleonora Kaufman, 33, admitted that she had an affair with Detective Anthony Angula, right, a 'gotcha' moment for the defence . Fight: Mr Kaufman, left, with attorney Al Milian, in a Miami-Dade court during beginning arguments in his murder trial . Defence attorney William Matthewman asked Howell if it was true that she had intimate relations with Angula. Howell danced around answering the question, instead telling the court: ‘I am married and I have three kids and my job is important to me,’ according to NBC Miami. She later said that her husband was aware of the affair, adding: ‘I am happily married and I don’t have any issues with that any longer.’ The tension reached boiling point when Matthewman accused Howell of perjury and asked simply – yes or no – if she had an affair with the detective. ‘Yes,’ she answered, before storming out of the courtroom, according to CBS Miami. The ‘gotcha’ moment was damaging to the prosecution, who is accusing Kaufman of strangling his wife in their Florida home in 2007. Earlier this week, the Florida court listened to the dramatic 911 call made by a husband accused of strangling his wife to death, but whose defence claims died of a previously undetected heart condition. 'Oh my god - I don't know what is going on,' Kaufman was heard by the court to say upon reporting finding his 33-year-old wife Eleonora (Lina) unconscious on their bathroom floor in November 2007. 'I don't know what happened. She's on the floor dying. She's not breathing.' Stone-faced: Howell dodged the defence attorney's questions several times before she was forced to answer about the affair . On trial for the second-degree murder of his wife, the prosecution allege that the call occurred moments after Kaufman strangled his wife to death at their Aventura, Florida, home. Wiping tears away from his eyes as he sat in court, Kaufman watched as the prosecution showed the jury pictures of his wife's body covered in cuts and abrasions, which they said were not there hours before her death. 'Lina Kaufman died as a result of mechanical asphyxiation to her neck, and her husband is the one who did it,' said prosecuting attorney Joseph Mansfield to the jury according to ABC News . According to the defence, Kaufman woke up and found his wife dead on the floor of their bathroom with her neck lying on a magazine rack in the early hours of November 7, 2007. 'The state's evidence cannot even prove that a homicide occurred, let alone that Adam Kaufman did it,' said defence attorney Bill Matthewman. The prosecution acknowledged that it took state medical examiners 18 months to issue a finding that Lina Kaufman's death was murder, but Mansfield said that was due to all possible alternatives being considered. Gone: Eleonora (Lina) Kaufman pictured here on her wedding day was found unconscious on the bathroom floor in November 2007 by her husband . Adam Kaufman, 39 (left) claims that he found his wife collapsed onto the magazine rack seen in the right picture in the couple's Aventura, Florida, home . Dr. Bruce A. Hyma, Miami-Dade County's chief medical examiner explained that 'only direct focused pressure' consistent with pressure exerted by another person could have caused the deep bleeding discovered in the victim's neck muscles. 'A healthy, active woman, arguable in the best shape of her life, and all that ended because of the actions of that man, her husband,' said Mansfield according to the Miami Herald . The defence team for Kaufman told the jury that Lina Kaufman was cursed with fainting episodes and also had significant scarring on her heart, which could have been the cause of her collapse. They also concluded that the injuries to the mother-of-two's neck were the result of falling and hitting the magazine rack in the bathroom. 'This case is a tragedy of errors. An innocent man was charged with a non-existent crime, this is a prosecution in search of a crime,' said Matthewman. Justice: Judge Bronwyn Miller listens to an attorney in opening arguments during Mr Kaufman's trial . Joseph Mansfield, Assistant State Attorney, (left) gives an opening argument in the trial of Adam Kaufman as Bill Matthewman, attorney for Adam Kaufman, (right) listens . The death of Lina Kaufman came to national prominence when her husband was charged with her murder in 2009, 18 months after her death and only when Kaufman complained to the medical examiner's office about the amount of time spent on the investigation. Appearing in court in 2009, the property developer's defence initially hinged around a spray tan the day before her death, Lina's first ever, which was claimed caused her to have a massive allergic reaction according to NBC Miami . However, the prosecution have been dismissive of this claim and that of Lina suffering from a bad heart. 'Under the laws of science, it's impossible to have happened either way the defendant suggested it happened,' said Mansfield. Together: Adam and Lina Kaufman pictured on vacation were said to have had a happy marriage . Opening the case by playing the distressing 911 call, Kaufman was heard hysterically screaming that his wife is not breathing. The prosecution alleged that the information Kaufman gave on the call was that of a calculating man beginning to cover his tracks. 'Lina had a bad heart,' countered defence attorney Bill Matthewman. 'You will hear no motive. No evidence of a motive whatsoever. 'No life insurance. No financial crimes. No affairs during the marriage on behalf of Adam or Lina. 'No neighbours heard any arguments.' Under house arrest with his two children since 2009, Kaufman is supported by his wife's family and her mother will testify to the court that her daughter 'suffered from seizures, from fainting, from headaches.' It was on November 6, 2007, that Eleonora 'Lina' Kaufman received her first even spray tan, went to see a girlfirned who looked at the work and noted at the time there were no bruises on her body. Then at 6 a.m on November 7, a frantic sounding Kaufman phoned 911 to report his wife's death, in a phone call which lasted more than 15 minutes. 'Oh God! Oh God! Lina,' cried Kaufman as he was instructed to give his wife CPR. During the trial today, the jury heard from Dr. Tracy Baker, a plastic surgeon who had performed breast-implant surgery on Lina Kaufman. Not Guilty: Mr Kaufman was introduced by his defence team as a proud father and as a distraught widower . He told told the court that he knew Lina to be fit and to work out two to three times a week and that during his examination of her never found any heart symptoms. The court also heard from Larissa Adamyan, Lina's best friend who said that she had seen her friend have at least one fainting spell. 'She was dizzy, she called she called me. She was dizzy and on the floor,” said Adamyan according to CBS Miami . The police first became suspicious of Kaufman after one officer noted that his Mercedes-Benz was warm on the hood and was making clicking sounds as though it had just been driven when they arrived at his house on the night his wife died. In addition, two firefighters who arrived at the scene told the court that it was suspicious to them that Kaufman was dressed and that only one side of the pair's bed appeared to have been slept in. The defence dismissed this as pure speculation and even went as far as to say that the emergency workers could have mistaken Kaufman's identical twin Seth, who lived down the street and had come to the house that night, for his brother. Lt. Michael Castro reported that Kaufman told emergency workers that he found his wife slumped over a toilet like she had been vomitting. Vacation: In happier times Adam and Lina Kaufman are pictured on the beach near to their Florida home . The firefighter said that Kaufman changed his story at Aventura Hospital and said that he found his wife's neck resting on the magazine rack. He also added that he was wary of Kaufman's 'odd' behaviour that shifted from calm to angry. 'It was almost like an act,' said Castro. The defence have hired Dr. Michael Bodden, the former medical examiner for New York City to debunk the prosecutions claims. 'The investigation underlying this case was biased, incompetent, flawed and inept,' said Matthewman. Currently free on bail of $500,000, Kaufam could be sentenced to life imprisonment if he is convicted.

"By . Simon Tomlinson . Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone was cleared of bribery charges yesterday after he paid a German criminal court £60million. The case has caused anger in Germany where critics said Ecclestone – who was accused of paying a banker a £27million bribe – had been ‘washed clean’ thanks to his ‘spectacular’ payment. Campaigners said allowing the defendant to use his wealth to stop a criminal prosecution was ‘worrying’. Scroll down for video . Deal on table: Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone arrives with his wife Fabiana Flosi (seated left) for his trial in Munich, where prosecutors have offered to drop bribery charges against him in exchange for £60million . Ecclestone's wife Fabiana Flosi (left) waits in court as the F1 boss consults lawyer Norbert Scharf (right) Munich District Court agreed to end the bribery trial yesterday when Judge Peter Noll announced that the offer was ‘acceptable’. It is the largest sum of its kind ever paid to settle a court case in Germany. The decision means Ecclestone, 83, leaves court a free man with no stain on his character. Had he been found guilty he could have faced up to ten years in jail. Robin Hodess, of anti-corruption movement Transparency International, said: ‘We need the law itself as a disincentive to bribery and corruption, and such settlements are a worrying trend, because we could see that more and more companies and individuals look for this way out.’ Deliberations: F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone talks to his lawyer Sven Thomas in the Munich courtroom . Germany’s former justice minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger called the deal an ‘impertinence’ that was ‘out of step’ with the process of law, adding: ‘Justice must not be traded off in this manner.’ She told a German radio station: ‘It doesn’t just leave a bad taste, it is really barefaced cheek.’ The politician called on lawmakers to tighten the loophole used by Ecclestone, which is designed to speed up cases for overburdened courts. News of Ecclestone’s victory made headlines in Germany with media organisations expressing outrage at the outcome of the case. Newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung attacked the deal in which, it said, ‘the briber is supposed to be washed clean with a spectacular payment’. ‘The saying goes, “Money doesn’t stink”, but that’s wrong here: these millions stink to high heaven,’ it added. The top-selling Bild newspaper denounced the ruling saying it left ‘the bitter impression that not everyone is equal before the law’. Ecclestone, who is worth some £6billion, was accused of paying a £27million kickback to disgraced banker Gerhard Gribkowsky in 2005, to get him to sell his bank’s holdings in Formula One to a client of Ecclestone’s choosing. The sport’s boss claimed the money was not in dispute but that he paid it because he was being ‘shaken down’ and wanted Gribkowsky to keep silent about his wealth to British tax authorities. Presiding over the case: Judge Peter Noll (centre) arrives for another session of the trial of the F1 boss . But German prosecutors say that is false and that the sum was a bribe to get Gribkowsky to sell to a company favoured by Ecclestone, CVC Equity, allowing him to retain absolute authority over Formula One. Ecclestone claimed at Gribkowsky’s corruption trial in November 2011 that the banker was a man ‘obsessed’ with the sport, who wanted to leave his job at BayernLB bank to become part of it. He said Gribkowsky had threatened to falsely tell the taxman that Ecclestone, not his wife, was in charge of a family trust – claims that would have made him the target of a tax probe that could have cost him £2billion. Financial settlements are allowed in German criminal cases if the prosecution, aggrieved parties and the court agree. Around 300,000 deals of this kind are struck in the German justice system every year, but none of this magnitude. Munich state prosecutors yesterday told the court they would accept Ecclestone’s offer, citing his advanced age and ‘other circumstances’ as factors in their decision. Judge Noll said: ‘The proceedings will be temporarily suspended with the agreement of the prosecution and the accused, pending payment of the $100-million settlement.’ As he left court, Ecclestone said ‘bye-bye’ to reporters, adding he was off ‘to take care of Formula One’.","He last week offered £20m to settle case where he faced ten years in jail .

"By . Sean Poulter . Home buyers will be paying an average of £7,500 in stamp duty within two years if the current house price surge continues, it is claimed. The recent property price boom has delivered a huge windfall for the Treasury and the Chancellor George Osborne in terms of income from the controversial property tax. Research suggests that the failure to raise the thresholds at which stamp duty applies in line with rising prices means the Government made an extra £4.7billion from home buyers in 2012-13 alone. Home buyers will be paying an average of £7,500 in stamp duty within two years it is believed . It seems the Government is keen to keep picking the pockets of buyers with no plans to revise the tax on buying a home, despite claims the current system is warping the market. The struggle to find the money to pay stamp duty is putting a huge burden on home buyers, who are facing other big bills, such as raising a deposit, funding legal and removal costs. Research by estate agents Haart (correct) suggests the UK average house price will rise above £250,000 by the end of 2016, which is the threshold for stamp duty to rise from one per cent to three per cent. Currently, a house selling for £250,000 attracts stamp duty at one per cent, which works out at £2,500, however this rises to £7,500 once the price hits £250,001. Until 1997, stamp duty was charged at just one per cent on all homes sold for £60,000 or more. The recent property price boom has delivered a huge windfall for the Treasury and Chancellor George Osborne in terms of income from property tax . Now it is charged at one per cent on properties between £125,000 and £250,000, three per cent up to £500,000, four per cent at £500,000-£1,000,000, five per cent at £1,000,001-£2,000,000, and seven per cent above £2,000,001. The Institute of Economic Affairs slammed stamp duty as ‘a bad tax’ which should be ‘abolished’ by the Chancellor, or ‘at the very least’ overhauled. Both the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and the Council of Mortgage Lenders think the crude thresholds should be replaced with a system similar to the income tax regime. The Haart chief executive, Paul Smith, said: ‘If national property prices continue to increase at their current rate, the average price of a UK home will fall within the three per cent stamp duty tax bracket before the end of 2016 – which means buyers forking out at least £7,500 on top of other costs when moving home. ‘Where a property tips over into this 3% tax band, an extra penalty of at least £5,000 is incurred on any property priced over £250,001. ‘Stamp duty bands have not moved upwards in line with house price inflation, a fact that successive Governments have benefited from to the tune of £4.7 billion for 2012/2013. ‘First-time buyers, who pay an average £154,645, have no relief as they are already in the one per cent stamp duty band.’ A second survey published by the Rightmove property website today (mon) raises the predicted price rise for 2014 to eight per cent. Rightmove estimates house prices will continue to rise despite measures introduced by the Bank of England last month to curb prices such as new caps on high loan-to-income value loans and stronger affordability ‘stress tests’ for borrowers. Earlier this week the Office for National Statistics said house prices in London had risen at a record annual rate of 20.1per cent while they were up 10.5per cent across the UK. Rightmove said the Government’s Help to Buy scheme had not only encouraged first-time buyers, but had freed up the market for richer third-time buyers who could afford larger properties. Director at the group, Miles Shipside, said: ‘The unleashing of this more affluent group, plus good supporting acts from first-time and second-time buyers, will mean that the musical chairs of trading up and down will continue in the second half of the year having been kick-started by Help to Buy in the first half.’ The group also said that speeding up of housing completions, down 10 days year-on-year to 65 days had brought more sellers into the market. The housing website also added that the London ripple effect, which pushes up the prices of properties around the capital, continued unabated because of the shortage of suitable housing stock. The firm added it was seeing the beginnings of the same London ripple effect around large northern cities such as Manchester, Leeds, York and Liverpool. A third study published by the Post Office suggests the average cost of moving one rung up the property ladders is more than £100,000.

Institute of Economic Affairs slammed stamp duty as ‘a bad tax’"
"By . Ruth Styles . Rolling in the mud without a care in the world, peeking out from beneath a blanket and kicking around with a football: it's all play and no work for these adorable baby African elephants. But all is not what it seems as every single elephant is an orphan and one of the 101 rescued by the Nairobi-based David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust since 2001. Many of their mothers have been killed by poachers or fallen victim to angry farmers. One baby, Ndotto, had to be rescued after getting mixed up with livestock owned by Samburu herders and following them home to their village. Scroll down for videos .

Yet in spite of their traumatic early months, the orphaned babies are just as playful and inquisitive as other youngsters and as a result, their human 'family' is kept very busy indeed. Released to mark World Elephant Day, the snaps reveal that each pint-sized pachyderm has his or her own personality, quirks and traits and can be playful, shy or boisterous. Among the shyer babies is seven-week-old Mbegu, who was rescued after being attacked with stones and spears by villagers, furious after a local woman was killed by an adult elephant. During the fracas that ensued, Mbegu was separated from her herd and was only saved after a group of rangers from the Naibunga Conservancy placed themselves between the enraged crowd and . the calf.

Taken to the charity’s elephant orphanage in Nairobi National Park, the little calf has now recovered from her . ordeal and will grow up in the care of human keepers until she is old . enough to return to the wild. ‘Each orphan has their own tragic rescue story but their struggle of survival and zest for life is infectious,’ says Rob Brandford, director of the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust. 'Mbegu was rescued at a very young age so she has really taken to her carers and loves to suck their fingers for comfort.’ With Mbegu in Nairobi National Park is Barsilinga, who had a tragic start to life after his mother was shot . by poachers. Terribly injured, the female elephant had to be put to sleep, while her calf was taken to the orphanage. ‘Sadly, Africa’s elephants are under threat from poachers for their . ivory,' adds Brandford. Nevertheless, when he is old enough, Barsilinga and his best friend Kithaka, will be re-homed in Tsavo National Park. For now though, his days, much like those of a human child, are a whirlwind of play, cuddles and bottle feeds.

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . This is the shocking moment an owl was interrogated by superstitious Mexican villagers after being set on fire 'for being a witch'. The terrified animal was filmed being questioned by its captors from inside a scorched cage in the city of Durango, north-west Mexico, with its feathers badly charred and its legs bound. Believing it to be a witch, the female villagers can be heard demanding the owl reveal its human name and turn itself back into a woman if it wants to be freed. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Scroll down for video . Shocking: This owl was interrogated by superstitious Mexican villagers after being set alight for 'being a witch' The horrific scene was captured on video and later uploaded to social media by the villagers. Footage shows the burnt owl screeching at its captors as it flaps around inside the cage - just seconds after being set alight by the women. But the women interpret the bird's cries as proof that it is really a witch and does not like the fact that its true identity has . been discovered. They then repeatedly ask the owl to identify itself and at one stage, read sections of the Bible in the belief that this will force the animal to turn back into a woman. Under interrogation: The terrified animal was filmed being questioned by its captors from inside a scorched cage in the city of Durango, north-west Mexico, with its feathers badly charred and its legs bound with rope . Frightened: Believing it to be a witch, the female villagers can be heard ordering the owl to reveal its human name and turn itself back into a woman if it wants to be freed. Above, the owl looks at its captors from the cage . They are also heard recounting stories of how the owl had been seen looking through the . window at the home of one villager, and how it had apparently tried to curse another. The city of Durango, like many places in Mexico, includes the superstition that some women are witches that . have the power to turn into animals. Following its publication, the video was widely condemned by social media users, who urged police to track down the villagers and punish them as a warning to others to avoid such 'foolish' beliefs. Burnt alive: The horrific scene was captured on video and later uploaded by the women to social media . One user wrote: 'This is just an animal inside a cage and anything would scream if it was threatened by these women in this way.' Another added: 'This is just superstitious nonsense and I really wish that authorities could finally do something treat these people like the criminals they are.' It is unknown what happened to the owl following its interrogation.","Terrified owl filmed being interrogated by superstitious villagers in Mexico .

"By . Alex Greg for MailOnline . and Associated Press . A grand jury indicted Texas Governor Rick Perry on Friday for allegedly abusing the powers of his office by carrying out a threat to veto funding for state prosecutors investigating public corruption — making the possible 2016 presidential hopeful his state's first indicted governor in nearly a century. Perry is charged with abuse of official capacity, a felony that carries a sentence of between five and 99 years prison, and coercion of a public servant, which is punishable by two to 10 years in prison. Perry threatened to pull funds - $8 million worth - from the Travis County District Attorney's Public Integrity office if its head, Rosemary Lehmberg, a Democrat, didn't resign after a very public drink-driving conviction. At the time Perry demanded Lehmberg's resignation, her unit had just begun investigating the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT) - a $3 billion pet project of Perry's - regarding suspicious state grants disbursed by the Institute to allies of Perry. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Indicted on two felonies: Rick Perry is facing serious charges that carry lengthy jail time . Indicted: Travis County special prosecutor Mchael McCrum announces that Governor Rick Perry, 63, is charged with abuse of official capacity, a first-degree felony, and coercion of a public official related to his effort last year to force District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg to resign after her drunken driving arrest . Had Lehmberg resigned, Perry would . have replaced her with one of his Republican cohorts - thus ending the . investigation and others by the Democrat-run Travis County District . Attorney's office, a thorn in Perry's side. However, . Lehmberg refused to resign her position, with the support of fellow . Democrats who didn't want the office to pass into Republican hands - and . Perry made good on his threat. A . special prosecutor spent months calling witnesses and presenting . evidence that Perry broke the law when he promised publicly to nix $7.5 . million over two years for the public integrity unit run by the office . of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg. Lehmberg, a . Democrat, was convicted of drunken driving, but refused Perry's calls to . resign. Though the . Republican governor now faces two felony indictments, politics dominates . the case. Lehmberg is based in Austin, which is heavily Democratic, in . contrast to most of the rest of fiercely conservative Texas. The grand . jury was comprised of Austin-area residents. The . unit Lehmberg oversees investigates statewide allegations of corruption . and political wrongdoing. It led the investigation against former U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, a Texas Republican who in 2010 was . convicted of money laundering and conspiracy to commit money laundering . for taking part in a scheme to influence elections in his home state — . convictions later vacated by an appeals court. A Texas grand jury indicted Republican Gov. Rick Perry on Friday on charges that he abused his position in a 2013 tussle over his state's Public Integrity Unit, headed by a Democratic official who was convicted of drunk driving . Rosemary Lehmberg was sentenced to 45 days in jail for DUI, about half of which she served before her release, and was ordered to pay a $4,000 fine . Perry stands accused of abusing his office by warning that he would veto funding for the Public Integrity Unit, which Lehmberg (L) runs. The governor made his threat in an attempt to get Lehmberg to resign following her drunk driving conviction (booking photo at right) in 2013 . Mary Anne Wiley, Perry's general counsel, predicted on Friday that the governor will be cleared of the charges against him – abuse of official capacity and coercion of a public servant. 'The . veto in question was made in accordance with the veto authority . afforded to every governor under the Texas Constitution,' she said. Perry issued a public statement along with his veto, writing in June 2013 that '[d]espite the otherwise good work [of] the Public Integrity Unit’s employees, I cannot in good conscience support continued state funding for an office with statewide jurisdiction at a time when the person charged with ultimate responsibility of that unit has lost the public’s confidence.' David . L. Botsford, Perry's defense attorney, whose $450-per hour fees are . being paid for by state funds, said Friday that he was outraged by the indictment. 'This . clearly represents political abuse of the court system and there is no . legal basis in this decision,' Botsford said in a statement. 'Today's . action, which violates the separation of powers outlined in the Texas . Constitution, is nothing more than an effort to weaken the . constitutional authority granted to the office of Texas governor, and . sets a dangerous precedent by allowing a grand jury to punish the . exercise of a lawful and constitutional authority afforded to the Texas . governor.' Several top aides to Perry appeared before grand jurors, including his deputy chief of staff, legislative director and general counsel. Perry himself was not called to testify. Abuse of official capacity is a first-degree felony with potential punishments of five to 99 years in prison. Coercion of a public servant is a third-degree felony that carries a punishment of two to 10 years. In office since 2000 and already the longest-serving governor in Texas history, Perry isn't seeking re-election in November. When he ran for president in 2012, . Perry plummeted from brief front-runner to national punchline, his once . promising campaign doomed by a series of embarrassing gaffes. Almost immediately after news of his indictment broke, Gov. Perry continued putting out red-meat messages for his conservative Twitter audience, continuing to send signals about a potential presidential run in 2016 . His most infamous 'Oops' moment came . during a primary debate when he couldn't remember which three . cabinet-level federal agencies he had promised to abolish if he were to . win the White House. As . he eyes another run, Perry has re-made his cowboy image, . donning stylish glasses, studying up on foreign and domestic affairs and . promising conservatives nationally that he's far more humble this time . around. Political . observers say the indictment may not immediately hurt his standing with . Republican primary voters – but Democrats didn't miss a change to gloat . Friday. 'Texans deserve . real leadership and this is unbecoming of our governor,' Texas . Democratic Party Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa said in a statement. He . demanded that Perry immediately resign. No . one disputes that Perry is allowed to veto measures approved by the . Legislature. But the left-leaning Texans for Public Justice government . watchdog group filed an ethics complaint accusing the governor of . coercion because he threatened to use his veto before actually doing so . in an attempt to pressure Lehmberg to quit. 'We're pleased that the grand jury determined that the governor's bullying crossed the line into illegal behavior,' said Craig McDonald, executive director of Texans for Public Justice. 'The complaint had merit, serious laws were potentially broken.' Michael McCrum, the San Antonio-based special prosecutor, said he 'took into account the fact that we're talking about a governor of a state - and a governor of the state of Texas, which we all love.' 'Obviously that carries a lot of importance,' McCrum said. 'But when it gets down to it, the law is the law.' McCrum . said he'll meet with Botsford on Monday to discuss when he will come to . the courthouse to be arraigned. McCrum said he doesn't know when Perry . will be booked. Perry and . other high-profile Republicans said Lehmberg should resign after she was . arrested and pleaded guilty to drunken driving in April 2013. A video . recording made at the jail showed Lehmberg shouting at staffers to call . the sheriff, kicking the door of her cell and sticking her tongue out. Her blood-alcohol level was nearly three times the legal limit for . driving. The indictment of Perry is the first of its kind since 1917, when James 'Pa' Ferguson was indicted on charges stemming from his veto of state . funding to the University of Texas in an effort to unseat faculty and . staff members he objected to. Ferguson was eventually impeached, then . resigned before being convicted.","Travis County grand jury indicted Texas Governor Rick Perry on two charges that he abused his position .

"By . Ruth Styles . He's hosting a new TV game show, is the new face of ITV's rugby coverage and is perched in a taxi on the way to the airport as he chats to MailOnline. Gethin Jones is not an easy man to pin down. But one place where you might have more luck is Tinder, after the 36-year-old Welsh star confessed that he was thinking of going digital in a bid to find love in an interview. 'We were joking about it,' he says of the off-the-cuff quip. 'I actually think Tinder will become the next new Saturday night TV phenomenon.' Busy man: Gethin is currently compering ITV's new daytime game show, The 21st Question . No love: Despite his dark good looks, Gethin has been single since splitting from Katherine Jenkins . While he's loath to reveal exactly what his profile might say, the presenter is happy to open up about his single status which he puts down to his inability to 'find the right one'. But when he does, he won't have any problems striking up a conversation. 'What's the worst that can happen if . you're polite in the way you go about it?' chuckles the 5ft 11"" former rugby player. 'Although I did get nervous . talking to Anthea Turner the other day.' Nervous though the veteran presenter might have made him, Jones says her ultra-groomed and glamorous style isn't the be-all and end-all when it comes to finding the perfect woman. 'I like a girl who's comfortable in her own skin,' he says after a moment's thought. 'Someone who can make light of a situation. 'Most importantly, I like a girl who can laugh. Not in a comedy stand up routine kind of way but who just likes laughing in general.' One person who's doing a lot of laughing at the moment is Jones himself, who is currently riding a wave of career success that includes new game show The 21st Question and a meatier role as the face of ITV's rugby coverage. 'I've loved making the show,' he says of the quiz, which sees him cast in the role of compère as contestants battle it out to be asked the eponymous 21st question and go home with a cash prize. 'I know the team really well so I've been involved on the production side from the early stages. That way I've really been able to take ownership, which is really important with a show like this.' Although the ITV show is on every day, Jones says the entire series was filmed over the course of one gruelling week, although in true cheeky chappy style, he confesses to enjoying every moment. Enjoying himself: Gethin says filming The 21st Question was gruelling but reveals that he enjoyed every minute . Hard work: Along with his starring role in The 21st Question, Jones is the new face of ITV's rugby coverage . 'Yes they were long days but they certainly didn't feel like that because they were a lot of fun,' he explains. 'I think being in good physical shape and eating well can really help keep you mentally sharp for that kind of job.' Getting it right, particularly in a format that has been revamped and remade thousands of times, also proved a challenge, although Jones says he's pleased with the result. 'I'm a big fan of quiz shows,' he insists. 'I've . watched quite a few and learned a lot from the best in the business . host-wise. 'I think the key element in a show like The 21st Question is . being able to change gear - to be able to enjoy it, have fun with . the contestants but also know when to build the drama. 'Based on the . stats from last week, the audience has increased throughout the show, which hopefully means that it's working.' It's certainly a new departure for Jones, whose career began on the drama-free Blue Peter and has since gone on to encompass everything from the sublime (Britain's Secret Treasures) to the panned (Daybreak). Still single: Although Gethin has been linked to several ladies, including Susie Amy (left), he says he is single . Nevertheless, he says that ups and downs notwithstanding, presenting remains his 'dream job' and one that allows him to use his profile for good, even if it means travelling to some less than lovely corners of the world. 'I feel overwhelmingly blessed and lucky to have been doing it for . 12 years,' he beams. 'It's a privilege to be able to use my profile to help others . and I genuinely can't remember a bad day at the office. 'I've been out to Afghanistan for the . past three years in a row filming Remembrance Week for the BBC,' he adds. 'Telling the extraordinary, brave and courageous stories of our . armed forces, past and present gives me great pleasure.' With the war in Afghanistan finally drawing to a close, it's unlikely he'll be filming too many more Remembrance Weeks. But that doesn't mean he has no more big ambitions, although fulfilling one of them means getting more closely involved with a certain dating app. 'Being a TV presenter is quite an . uncertain profession,' he admits, 'so in 10 years time, I hope the companies I'm involved with will have matured and . developed. 'I hope I'm still doing what I love doing, which is making and . hosting TV shows, and,' he pauses to allow himself a grin, 'I hope to have a wife and a few little ones . around to share it with.' Singletons, if you aren't on Tinder already, now might be a good time to sign up.

Injured: After the attack, Rory Kliewer was taken to a local emergency room where her scratches and bruises were treated . Rory said she managed to throw the three-foot-long otter off her after it bit her thigh and backside. However the otter jumped onto the dock and chased her. When a family friend tried to scare off the otter, it rose up on its hind legs and hissed. The otter didn't back off until the owner of the cabin where Rory was staying yelled at it. 'As far as I'm concerned, this thing was literally trying to kill this kid,' Pat Hinschberger told TwinCities.com. Hinschberger said he's been going to Bone Lake his whole life and has never witnessed or heard about an otter attack. 'Nobody I have at our cabin is going in the water until those otters are gone - that's the way I look at it,' he said. 'I can't chance something like that happening again.'

'Afterwards, I was kind of amazed that in less than a minute it could do all of this, which was pretty scary,' Rory told CBS. 'I was wearing a life jacket. If I hadn’t been, it probably would’ve pushed me under and drowned me.' The news comes after a boy and his grandmother were viciously attacked by a male otter as they were swimming in a river near Seattle last week.","Rory Kliewer was chased and mauled by a 40-pound otter at Bone Lake on Saturday .

The Utah resident opened up about her experience at a three-day conference organized by Avera Health and the U.S. Attorney's Office. The forum aimed to raise awareness about . human trafficking in the Dakotas, which in North Dakota has been partly . fueled by the recent massive influx of workers to the Bakken oil fields.

Youngsters pretending to be Wayne Rooney on the lawn cause damage costing £94million each year, research reveals. Now Mr Cowan has come up with a solution - a goal with a vast backstop net that prevents stray balls from going over and wide. Jonathan Cowan has invented a goal with a vast backstop net that prevents stray balls from going over and wide . Saved: 'Open Goaaal' is a net that sits behind the goal and catches mis-hit strikes, preventing damage . Research found the average family spends £71 a year fixing household items damaged by stray footballs . The net of the 'Open Goaaal' stretches between two poles and can be tailored depending on size of the garden. The company's study found the average family spends £71 a year fixing household items damaged by stray footballs. And over a fifth (22 per cent) of people have been forced to fix damaged goods in the last year. Windows came top of the list of items hit by stray balls. Also making the top five list were fences, plants and trees, outdoor lights and BBQs. Mr Cowan said: 'There's barely a parent around who won't grimace at the mention of footballs and gardens. 'Ruining the plants, destroying the fence or annoying the neighbours - there are plenty of reasons and the repair bills pile up.' Mr Cowan's daughter, Tabitha, 13, was his inspiration as she grew up playing in their back garden and signed with Arsenal ladies at the age of 11. Mr Cowan said: 'There's barely a parent around who won't grimace at the mention of footballs and gardens' He added: 'We reckon that with more of our backstop goals in people's gardens there's still hope for the England football teams of the future.

The greenhouse incident sparked Mr Cowan into action. He said: 'We hung netting across the back of the garden on a wire. It was perfect - every time Tabitha missed the goal the netting would catch it. 'We wouldn't have to worry about it causing any damage. 'When we were finished we could just pull the net back across, out of sight. 'I've heard all sorts of awful feuds between neighbours, including our friend's neighbours knifing each football that fell over the fence, before returning it completely deflated.

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . A North Texas man has pleaded guilty to seeking revenge on his ex-girlfriend by emailing out videos of them having sex. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reports that 28-year-old Philip Welch Ingram struck the deal Thursday in exchange for five years of deferred adjudication probation. He pleaded guilty to improper visual recording and breach of computer security. Both are felonies. Guilty: Philip Welch Ingram, 28, exacted revenge on an ex-girlfriend by sending her email contacts videos he had secretly taken of their sexual acts. He pleaded guilty in exchange for five years of deferred adjudication probation . Ingram must undergo psychological treatment and pay a $500 fine. He can't live in Tarrant County or contact the ex-girlfriend as part of the agreement. Police say Ingram hid a video recorder to film the couple. According to a search warrant affidavit obtained by the paper, Ingram and the victim began dating in summer 2012. Within months they were living together, but the relationship soon deteriorated. The woman told investigators that Ingram later broke into her home using her hidden emergency key, and that she once awoke to find him sitting on her bed, going through her cellphone. She called 911 but he left before police arrived, the affidavit states. The victim previously told the Star-Telegram that on the night before the emails were sent out, Ingram had sent her several disturbing text messages, falsely accusing her of being out with another man. He then threatened to email out videos of the couple engaged in sexual acts and sent her excerpts of the videos to prove he had them. She said his last message, 'Have a good morning,' was sent about 2 am on May 30, 2013, as she slept. When the woman woke, Ingram had already hacked into the woman’s email, sending the explicit videos to more than 100 of the woman's contacts — including her parents, friends, employer, and professional associates. 'My parents actually came to my house around 5:30 a.m. and woke me up because my dad had received the email,' the woman previously told the Star-Telegram. Ingram declined comment to the newspaper after the hearing.","Philip Welch Ingram, 28, pleaded guilty to improper visual recording and breach of computer security in Fort Worth .

A 68-year-old disabled veteran inserted sewing needles into packaged meat at an Illinois grocery store for more than a year 'just for the hell of it', the FBI said. Ronald Avers faces up to 70 years in prison for allegedly tampering with everything from ground beef to steaks at Shop 'n Save in Belleville at least seven times from May last year. Security footage allegedly showed the divorcee, who is hooked up to an oxygen tank, riding into the store on a motorized scooter and touching a range of meat products that he ultimately didn't buy. Scroll down for video . Scene: Ronald Avers faces up to 70 years in prison for allegedly tampering with everything from ground beef to steaks at Shop 'n Save in Belleville, Illinois (pictured) at least seven times from May last year. FBI special agents and Belleville police arrested Avers on Tuesday after grocery store employees recognized him from CCTV video. Police found an open package of sewing needles in Avers' pickup truck, according to an affidavit filed by FBI Special Agent Daniel Cook with the criminal complaint. Avers told cops he kept the needles on . hand to mend pants he tore while camping. He eventually admitted to inserting needles in the meat products, telling FBI investigators he concealed the needle in the holder of his portable oxygen tank. ''Every . now and then I would stick one in a hamburger',' Cook quoted Avers as . saying before the man expounded, ""'Mostly hamburger, a couple of times I . did it with a roast, maybe a pork chop every now and then'.'

The latest incident occurred on July 12 when a needle was found in a package of pork steaks. One time, an employee found sewing needles . in a package of pork chops. SuperValu Inc., the Minnesota-based . corporate parent of the Shop 'n Save chain, stressed that none of the . cases resulted in serious injury, and that the alleged tampering was . isolated to only the meat section of one store.

Online court records show that Avers has a history of traffic offenses but no previous criminal background. Swanson said customers who bought fresh meat from the store before July 12 can get a refund or exchange.

"By . Sam Webb for MailOnline . A British aid worker who died from gunshot wounds to the head and chest following a suicide bomb attack in Afghanistan was unlawfully killed, a coroner has ruled. Dhamender Singh Phangurha, known as Del Singh, died in the attack on a restaurant in the capital, Kabul, on January 17 which killed 21 people including senior UN officials, Afghan dignitaries and restaurant staff. The inquest in Winchester, Hampshire, was told that the Taverna Du Liban restaurant was frequently used by foreigners as it was considered a safe and secure place. But the explosion created by the suicide bomber killed the security guards at the entrance and breached the steel door, allowing two terrorists carrying AK47 rifles to enter the premises and shoot indiscriminately at staff and customers including Mr Singh, who was also a Labour MEP candidate. Scroll down for video . Slain: Labour MEP candidate Del Singh, pictured with his partner Komal Adris, made a desperate phone call to his office seconds before he was gunned down in a terrorist attack, an inquest heard today . Mr Singh's partner, Komal Adris, 35, said he had advised Labour leader Ed Miliband (left) on Israeli and Palestinian policy . Central Hampshire Coroner Grahame Short was told that Mr Singh, 39, from Southampton, was an international development specialist who had extensive experience managing EU and UN projects in post-conflict countries including Afghanistan and Sierra Leone. At the time of his death, he was working as an international aid adviser for Adam Smith International, ensuring that aid coming into the country was going to the right places, the inquest heard. Mr Singh and his friend, Gnanathuria Nagarajh, a Malaysian national who also worked for ASI, were killed by insurgents at about 7.20pm on January 17 as they dined at the restaurant. Order: A solider organises his colleagues outside the restaurant in the Afghan capital after the attack . Aftermath: Afghan security forces arrive at the scene of the explosion in the capital, Kabul . Simon Chase, a former British soldier from Limavady, County Londonderry, was also killed. A statement from Richard Ironside, a manager with Tour Afghanistan, said Mr Singh and his team would always report their movements from Victor 8, the guesthouse where they were living, to the operations room. He said the Taverna Du Liban was deemed a safe place because it had a steel reinforced entry gate, security guards, people entering would be searched and there were also alternative exit points. As the bomb went off Mr Singh used his mobile phone to contact his colleagues before saying: 'I'm at the restaurant, I'm at the restaurant' Shortly after the men arrived at 6.52pm, Mr Ironside heard a loud explosion, the inquest heard. He said: 'A call then came in from Del. He was saying ""I am at the restaurant, I am at the restaurant. I can hear firing in the background"".' Mr Ironside said he could hear rounds being shot and then the phone went dead, the hearing was told. He tried calling Mr Singh back but only discovered he was dead and had been taken to Camp Phoenix several hours later, the inquest heard. A post-mortem examination carried out by forensic pathologist Dr Debbie Cook and forensic firearms expert Khaldoun Kabbani showed that Mr Singh had suffered four gunshot wounds - two to the head and two to the chest - which would have killed him immediately. Dr Cook said there was no indication that he had been injured by the bomb blast outside the restaurant, the inquest heard. Acting Detective Inspector Matthew Potts, from Thames Valley Police's South East Counter Terrorism Unit, said it was still not clear exactly what had happened but that the bomb outside had allowed the two gunmen to breach security and gain access to the restaurant and the people inside. He said: 'It does look like it was more of an indiscriminate attack on the occupants. 'Some staff and diners managed to escape out of the restaurant through the kitchen. 'Local police have not been able to establish who was responsible for this attack.' He told the coroner that investigations were continuing in Afghanistan but it was believed the attack was carried out by terrorists, although the motivation was unknown. Dishi Kaur, Mr Singh's younger sister, broke down as she told the coroner she still found her brother's death hard to talk about but said Mr Singh was 'a really great man'. Recording his verdict, Mr Short said: 'When deaths happen abroad I have limited powers to investigate. 'However, based on the evidence that I do have, I think Del was killed at random and deliberately by terrorists.' Tragedy: Dharmender Singh with his sisters (left to right) Ruby, 26, Dishi, 34, and Bali, 39 . Mr Singh, pictured and partner Komal Adris (left). Right, Del Singh's sister, Dishi Kaur arriving at Winchester Coroner's Court . Ed Miliband paid tribute after the incident, saying: 'He dedicated his life to working with people across the world who needed his support' He went on: 'I suspect they were trying to disrupt the government and election that was then in progress. 'The insurgents themselves were killed but I believe their intention was to kill as many people in the restaurant as they could, themselves knowing that they would die. 'Del was trying to help the government and people of Afghanistan and it is clearly a great tragedy that he died in this way.' Following his death, Mr Singh's partner, Komal Adris, 35, said he had advised Labour leader Ed Miliband on Israeli and Palestinian policy and travelled regularly to Afghanistan. He had been a Labour candidate for this year's Euro elections and Mr Miliband paid tribute to him after the incident, saying: 'He dedicated his life to working with people across the world who needed his support.' Labour election candidate Del Singh, who was killed last night in Kabul, was a former advisor to the UN and Department for International Development whose work had taken him to a string of trouble spots. Born and raised in Southampton, Hampshire, to factory worker parents, he went on to earn a Business degree and a Masters in European Studies, before beginning work with the EU in 2000. According to a website set up to help his election bid, Mr Singh from 2002-2004 worked for as an Adviser to the European Mission in Kosovo, where he helped develop the first economic national plan for the country. In 2006/7, in Sudan, he managed a European Commission aid development programme and has also worked on UN and DfID funded projects in Afghanistan, Sierra Leone, Libya, Nepal, and Palestine. It is unclear what he was doing in Afghanistan at the time of his death, but he had worked in at least four different roles advising on development in the country over the past decade. A campaigner for the Labour Party since 1992, he had worked part time between 1999 and 2000 as a research assistant for Nick Ainger, then Wales Minister, and in 2004 in support of John Prescott as Deputy Prime Minister. Mr Singh had hoped to represent the South West in the European Parliament, running on a ticket promising greater regulation for banks and tighter rules on corporate tax.","Del Singh died in assault on heavily fortified restaurant in Kabul .

Police in DeLand report that two officers spotted Zimmerman and his dog parked behind Pompano Pat's, a motorcycle and gun store, on Sunday shortly after midnight and approached him . The manager of a Florida business where George Zimmerman was recently questioned by police has denied that Zimmerman was ever hired to provide security, despite his claims otherwise to authorities. Police in DeLand report that two officers spotted Zimmerman and his dog parked behind Pompano Pat's, a motorcycle and gun store, on Sunday shortly after midnight and approached him. Zimmerman, who was acquitted last summer of the shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, told officers that the owner had given him permission to be there to provide security after a recent burglary, according to the police report . No citations were issued because . 'There was no evidence to support that a crime had occurred or was about . to occur,' Officer Jessica Mayo wrote in the report. Zimmerman 'in no way, shape or form' is employed by the store, Pompano Pat's manager Sam Porter said on Tuesday. 'He's not being paid to be act as a security officer or in any other way for Pompano Pat's,' Porter said. Porter confirmed that the store had a burglary about two weeks ago, with 10 rifles stolen. He said that internal store security was 'beefed up' after the incident, but that no after-hours security personnel were hired. The owner of Pompano Pat's, a friend of Zimmerman, has denied that he every hired Zimmerman to provide security for his gun and motorcycle store . Porter said that Johnson knew Zimmerman and had a friendship with him but wouldn't elaborate further. Zimmerman became a national figure during his second-degree murder trial last year for fatally shooting the Martin during an altercation in Sanford, Florida, in February 2012. The case raised questions about race and self-defense laws in America. Zimmerman, who identifies himself as Hispanic, was acquitted last July in the shooting of Martin, who was black. Zimmerman became a national figure during his second-degree murder trial last year for fatally shooting the Martin during an altercation in Sanford, Florida, in February 2012 . Zimmerman filed an appeal this week in a defamation lawsuit against NBC Universal and three reporters. Last month, a judge dismissed Zimmerman's lawsuit, saying the former neighborhood watch leader had failed to show that the network acted with malice. In his lawsuit, Zimmerman says NBC's editing of a story about the shooting made it sound as if he voluntarily told a phone operator that Martin was black.","On Sunday night two cops found Zimmerman and his dog parked behind Pompano Pat's in DeLand, Florida .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . Donald Sterling has lost his bid to halt the sale of his basketball team the Los Angeles Clippers. In a preliminary ruling today in an LA court, Judge Michael Levanas ruled that his wife Shelly Sterling has full control of the family trust that owns the team - paving the way for a $2 billion sale to ex-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. In court, the judge said that 'Shelly clearly had the authoritiy to transfer the shares' of the team and dismissed the claims of her disgraced husband who has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and therefore unable to manage his affairs. Scroll down for video . Victory: Shelly Sterling reacts while facing the media outside the courthouse in Los Angeles on July 28, 2014 after a ruling was made in her favor in the case between her and her husband Donald over the sale of  the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers basketball team . Smiles: Shelly Sterling reacts to questions while meeting with the media outside the courthouse in Los Angeles on July 28, 2014 after her victory in her battle against husband, Donald Sterling . Loser: Donald Sterling has failed in his bid to block the $2 billion sale of his basketball team the LA Clippers by his wife, Shelly Sterling . Judge Michael Levanas said the deal, . brokered by Sterling's estranged wife, Shelly Sterling, was permissible . and could be consummated even if Sterling, who has been banned for life . from the NBA for racist remarks, chose to appeal. 'She . had every good reason to believe that Donald agreed to the sale of the . team,' Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Michael Levanas said. The judge said his tentative ruling would take formal effect when he issues it in writing in coming weeks. 'Either way, we'd win,' Shelly Sterling said outside the courtroom. 'I am just doing what I had to do.' Donald Sterling claimed his wife deceived him about the medical exams. Sterling has vowed to fight the NBA until his death and is expected to continue to wage court battles to stop the sale. The ruling in Los Angeles County Superior Court is unlikely to put an end to the bizarre saga that began in April when a recording surfaced of Sterling scolding his young girlfriend V. Stiviano for bringing black men to Clippers games. Recordings: Pictured here in Beverly Hills on Friday is V.Stiviano. The socialite recorded Donald Sterling making the racist comments about African Americans that sparked the whole controversial episode . Decision: Donald Sterling's lawyer Max Blecher leaves the courthouse during a lunch-break in Los Angeles, California on July 28, 2014 before final arguments in the Sterling vs Sterling case between husband Donald and wife Shelly over the sale of the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers . The NBA moved quickly to ban Sterling for life and fined him $2.5 million. Sterling was apologetic after the audio recording went viral, but his mea culpa backfired when he criticized Lakers great Magic Johnson, who had been photographed with Sterling's girlfriend, as a bad role model for kids because he had HIV. Sterling was roundly criticized from locker rooms to the Oval Office, where President Barack Obama called Sterling's remarks 'incredibly offensive racist statements.' With the NBA threatening to seize the team and auction it, Sterling initially gave his wife of 58 years permission to negotiate a sale but then refused to sign it. He said he would sue the league instead and then revoked the trust. Couple at war: Donald Sterling, owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, left and his wife Shelly pose for a photograph before his team played the Memphis Grizzlies in Game Four of the Western Conference Quarterfinals during the 2012 NBA Playoffs in May, 2012 . The nonjury trial held over several weeks focused mainly on whether Shelly Sterling properly removed her husband as a trustee and whether her actions carried any weight after he revoked the trust. Donald Sterling's lawyers contended that his wife and her lawyers conspired to trick him and that the mental exams by two doctors were faulty. They said Sterling didn't know his competency as a trustee was being evaluated and that he showed no signs of incompetence on the witness stand. In combative testimony, Sterling said he would 'never, ever sell' the team he bought in 1981 for about $12 million. Before taking the stand, he kissed his wife and then testified that he loved her. But the following day when she approached him in court he yelled, 'get away from me, you pig!' War: Shelly Sterling sits with her husband, Donald Sterling, during the Los Angeles Clippers' NBA basketball game against the Detroit Pistons in Los Angeles in 2010 . Sterling, a lawyer who made a fortune as a landlord, has filed an antitrust lawsuit in federal court against the NBA and he sued his wife, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver and the league in state court. Lawyers for Shelly Sterling and Ballmer had urged the judge to let the sale go through because it was in the best interest of the family trust. They said an auction was less likely to bring such a high price and that coach Doc Rivers, key players and sponsors were likely to walk if Donald Sterling's ownership was prolonged. 'The trust has a golden bird in the hand,' Shelly Sterling's lawyers wrote in court papers. 'A sale of the Clippers for $2 billion is indisputably a bonanza for the Sterling family. Donald's strident opposition is motivated by only selfish considerations.' Donald Sterling said he could get more for the team by also selling TV rights and through his $9 billion suit against the league.","Donald Sterling has failed to stop the record $2 billion sale of the Los Angeles Clippers .

Steven Herbert (left) was attacked when he acted as a peacemaker when his friend (right) was started on by the gang. As Mr Herbert tried to diffuse the situation, he was beaten. This  CCTV was taken just before his death . Father-of-two and popular chef Mr Herbert, 34, was on his way home from New Year's celebrations in Hull when he was horrifically attacked by the trio. He is pictured with his partner Kim Field and one of his young daughters . Mr Herbert had been walking home with his friend in the morning of New Year's Day when the gang approached them. The court heard how the chef put his hands up to the trio in a conciliatory way and told them, 'Come on now, it's New Year's Eve'. However, Samuel Jordan, who had been posting photos of himself posing and drinking on Facebook just hours earlier, punched the 'gentle giant' - knocking him to the ground. Jordan, 22, had also posted images of himself pointing a plastic gun at his head and flexing his muscles while topless with the caption that he was bound for 'jail or the cemetery', prior to the incident. One of his accomplices, Soul Humphries, 22 - a rapper who performs under the name 'Konflikt' - helped to beat Mr Herbert unconscious. Then, as the chef lay on the ground defenceless with his eyes glazed over, their female sidekick Tiffany Clark, 23, straddled him and repeatedly hit him in the face before kicking him in the head. Young mother Tiffany Clark, 23, (above) straddled Mr Herbert as he lay dying on the floor and repeatedly hit him in the face before kicking him in the head . Mr Herbert died from severe brain injuries sustained in the attack and the three were yesterday jailed for life for his murder. The trio were sentenced at Hull Crown Court after being found guilty last month of his death. Jordan was ordered to serve a minimum of 15 years behind bars while Clark must serve 14 years and Humphries 13-and-a-half years. Mr Herbert left behind partner Kim Field, 32, and their two young daughters, Courtney, 13, and Ellie, nine. Sentencing the trio, Judge Michael Mettyear said: 'This is a tragic case, mainly because of the loss of Mr Herbert's life, but the damage goes much deeper. 'It affects his long-term partner, his two children and his many friends. Steven Herbert, 34, was the father of two girls. 'This was pointless, public night-time violence on what should have been a night of joy and celebrations.' Devastated Miss Field has told of her shock at a young mother being responsible for ripping a family apart. She asked: 'How can a woman do something like that? 'How? She's a mum herself yet she didn't care about how my children would feel without a dad. 'When I picture Steven lying there in the street, I see her on top of him hitting him while he lay defenceless. 'Those three animals will never know what they have taken away from us. They didn't see my children's tears when I took them to the cemetery for Father's Day where they talked to a headstone instead of their dad. 'They didn't see Ellie having only Steven's picture to kiss to say thank you for every birthday present she got this year. 'Steven was perfect. No one ever had a bad word to say about him. He was just such a lovable man who touched the hearts of everyone he met. 'Life without him is like having my right arm cut off, nothing will ever be the same. He was my first and only boyfriend. We started dating when I was 14 and he was 15. We were a couple for so long that everything I now do without him is for the first time. Samuel Jordan (left) and Soul Humphries (right), both 22, beat Mr Herbert to death with their accomplice in Hull on New Year's Day. Prior to the attack they had boasted on social media about fighting and drinking in the city . 'Nothing would have been good enough, whether it was 15 years or a hundred years, but we have some sort of justice for Steven. 'I'm feeling devastated, heartbroken, every emotion possible.' Miss Field said she treasures the final photo of the couple together, which was taken at a New Year's Eve party with close friends just hours before his murder. After seeing in 2014, Mr Herbert headed to a pub with a friend while his wife stayed behind to continue chatting. On his way home at about 6am, Mr Herbert encountered the gang, who had been trying to start rows with innocent strangers in Hull City centre weeks earlier and were again hell-bent on a fight. Jordan, who had a violent criminal record, had only been released from prison in November. Popular Mr Herbert has been described by friends and family as a 'gentle giant with a generous spirit' He was jailed for four and a half years in 2009 for being part of a gang which tried to behead a man with a decorative samurai sword during a burglary. Prior to the incident, he posted a photo of himself swigging whisky from the bottle with the caption: 'Drowning sorrows :( ' Humphries, meanwhile, had been bragging on Twitter about his fights in the city centre. He wrote: 'U know what, i was in pub, one lad 2 times the size of me started, night night silly *******. 'Goes to the taxi rank, another lad swang for me missed, night night silly *******. loooool. 'Next thing you know im on the floor in town, cuffed, 4 coppers with tazers surroundin me. thought i was gettin tazered looool. 'Let away no fine nothin, so jus chillin;)' He added: 'The worst is im cheeky wid it, il beat you then try move your mum or sister'. In the days before the murder, the pair spoke about 'saving themselves' ready for their New Year's Eve night out. And Humphries asked Jordan: 'Where we terrorisin?' Jordan posted: '2014 I'm gunner get so f***** up I wake up in 2015!!!' And Clark replied: 'Hahahha DITTO! x' Following the murder, Miss Field had to identify her partner's body and tell their two young daughters he had been killed. She recalled: 'I wasn't even allowed to kiss him goodbye. They both started screaming when I told them Steven was dead.

'Ellie was screaming ""I want Daddy"" and Courtney was saying ""no Mummy, no"". 'In the weeks afterwards they were really frightened. They kept begging me not to go out on my own. 'They thought if something like that could happen to their dad, their hero, the man who looked so big and strong to them, then it could happen to anyone.' Miss Field said that it was 'living torture' seeing Clark's lack of remorse during the trial. Clark claimed that she only kicked Mr Herbert 'to get his attention'. She said: 'She just sat there and scowled at all the witnesses. 'After killing Steven, one of them boasted on Facebook that they had blind-sided him during the attack. Listening to that knocked me ill. 'Steven was just doing what Steven did, trying to protect other people. 'I can imagine him standing there putting up his hands and trying to calm things down. 'He was such a generous spirit and our kids adored him. 'It's good that we got justice for Steven, but it's not going to bring back the love of my life.' 'I know he would want me to be happy and he'd want me to be strong for the girls, but everything is so hard now he's not here. 'Those animals will never know the hurt they have caused.

"By . Emma Glanfield . Jess Rowles, 24, was left needing stitches to her lip and chin after allegedly being punched in the face by a taxi driver following a night out in Bristol on July 27 . These photos show the horrific injuries a woman suffered after being punched in the face by a rogue taxi driver following a night out. Jess Rowles, 24, said she was assaulted by the taxi driver in an 'isolated' street after she told him she didn't have enough money to pay the fare as he took her home on July 27. She had enjoyed several drinks with a friend in Bristol city centre prior to the incident and was on her way home at about 2.30am when the taxi driver allegedly locked the doors before driving to the random street. The insurance company worker said she realised during the drive home she didn't have enough money and asked the taxi driver to stop off at a cash point. However, he ended up dropping the two young women off in the secluded street – miles from home – before allegedly assaulting Miss Rowles. She said: 'We had £14 but he wanted £20 so we asked him to take us to a cash point. 'He refused, locked us in the cab and said he was going to take us back to where he collected us. 'But in fact he dumped us in (another road) which was dark, but to be honest we were just glad to be able to get out the cab. 'Then as we walked away he got something out the boot of his car and sprayed us with water. 'I went back to ask him why he had done that and it felt like he punched me in the face. 'There was certainly a lot of force because it knocked me to the ground and I hit my face on the kerb.' The young women, from Shirehampton, Bristol, called the emergency services and police officers took Miss Rowles to hospital where she had several stitches to her lip and chin. However, the cabbie - which the girls believe was run by Bristol City Council and had an Asian driver who was in his 20s– drove off and police have been unable to track it down. Miss Rowles said she told the taxi driver she didn't have enough money to pay the fare as he took her home in Shirehampton, Bristol, and asked to be driven to a cash point. It was then he apparently punched her in the face . Avon and Somerset Police were informed of the incident but have now closed the investigation due to lack of evidence, infuriating Miss Rowles, who thinks they have done the 'bare minimum'. A force spokesman said: 'A thorough and detailed investigation was carried out based on the limited information and evidence available. 'CCTV was checked but there was no film showing the incident or a good shot of the actual taxi. 'House-to-house investigations were also carried out and private CCTV checked but no relevant footage was found. 'Because Miss Rowles has a right to complain if she feels we have not carried out a thorough investigation, this has been reported to the force's professional standards department to review.' Ms Rowles has now gained the support of her local MP, Wayne Harvey, who said: 'Seeing the photos of this horrific, violent and cowardly attack on Jess has left me feeling sickened. Avon and Somerset Police has closed an investigation into the case which Miss Rowles blasted them for, saying they had done the 'bare minimum'. She now has the support of MPs who said the attack was 'cowardly' 'This is the second attack that has been brought to my attention regarding taxi drivers becoming violent and assaulting their passengers. 'With all the CCTV we have in Bristol this should be being picked up.' MP Charlotte Leslie added: 'Taxis should be seen as a place of safety for people, not a place where you risk being assaulted. 'It seems sad but perhaps we need to encourage people to note down taxi licence numbers when they get in a taxi.'","Jess Rowles needed stitches to her lip and chin after being punched in face .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . and James  Nye . Early on Sunday morning, Ommy Irizarry posted a message on Facebook to mark his ninth wedding anniversary. 'I am very happy and can't wait to see what the next 100 have in store for us,' he wrote, and tagged his wife, Rebecca, in the post. But hours later, Irizarry, 36 was killed during a freak plane crash on a Florida Gulf Coast beach near Sarasota, where they were celebrating their anniversary. The couple's daughter, 9-year-old Oceana, was critically injured. Wedding anniversary: Ommy Irizarry posted a loving tribute to his wife, Rebecca, (both pictured) on Sunday morning before he was killed when a plane crash landed on Florida beach later that afternoon . Tragic: This is the message that Ommy Irizarry posted to Facebook on Sunday morning, just hours before he lost his life and his nine-year-old daughter was critically injured in a freak plane crash landing on a Florida beach . The 1972 Piper Cherokee lost a wheel, damaged a wing and smashed its propeller shortly after making a distress call about 2:45 p.m. Sunday to Venice Municipal Airport, officials said. The plane crash-landed on Caspersen Beach, just south of the airport, at the southern tip of the island of Venice. Irizarry and his daughter were hit by the plane or its debris, officials said. Irizarry died at the scene. His daughter was airlifted to All Children's Hospital in St. Petersburg. Officials have not released further information about the victims.

Rebecca's page showed a photo of her and her husband in the water, smiling for the camera. About 4 p.m. Sunday, she wrote: 'We need prayers, now! Please stop and pray for Ommy and Oceana.' It's unclear how the plane or the debris hit father and daughter. A woman calling 911 from at the airport first informed officials that the plane would be landing on the beach. 'He's trying to make the airport,' said the caller. 'He says he's not going to make the airport. But he's going to be on the beach.'

"By . Emma Glanfield . Karen Henshaw, 70, burst into song during her final day on the bench at Blackpool Magistrates' Court . A long-serving magistrate forced to retire due to her age chose to go out with a bang by bursting into song on her final day in court. Karen Henshaw broke into her own version of ‘Nobody Loves A Fairy When She's Forty’ – changing the lyrics to ‘Nobody wants a JP when she's 70’ – on her last day on the bench at Blackpool Magistrates’ Court. The experienced JP, who has worked at the court for the last 15 years, received a round of applause for her performance, which came just minutes before the first defendant was brought into the dock. Mrs Henshaw, from Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, is being forced to give up her court duties because the Government stipulates that it is mandatory for all magistrates to retire at 70. However, not wanting to slip out of the courtroom quietly, the former civil servant chose to burst into song after she was handed a certificate to thank her for her time working for the justice system. In today's tongue-in-cheek performance, she sang: 'It seems this old JP is not wanted now. 'Nobody wants a JP when she's 70. Nobody wants a JP when she's old. 'She may still have her faculties but that is not enough. 'They like their bit of justice from a younger bit of stuff.' The song went on: 'For years I have sat on this bench. 'I've sentenced man and sentenced wench. 'I can't do all I did, I am satisfied because... 'I would rather be a has been than a never was.' As the performance came to a close, the courtroom erupted into a round of applause and the first defendant – who was facing a charge of assault – was brought into the dock. Mrs Henshaw broke into her own version of ‘Nobody Loves A Fairy When She's Forty’ – changing the lyrics to ‘Nobody wants a JP when she's 70’ – ahead of court proceedings at Blackpool Magistrates’ Court (pictured) Mrs Henshaw, from Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, is being forced to give up her court duties because the Government stipulates that it is mandatory for all magistrates to retire at 70 . For years a magistrate I have been . Had justice done and justice seen . Bat alas, I'm getting on the years have flown somehow . And it seems this old JP is not wanted now . Nobody wants a JP when she's 70 . Nobody wants a JP when she's old . She may still have her faculties but that is not enough . They like their bit of justice from a younger bit of stuff . When once your big brown eyes have lost their glitter . And you voice has turned from gruff instead of bold . Your JP's days are ending when your hands have started bending . Nobody wants a JP when she's old . For years I have sat on this bench . I've sentenced man and sentenced wench . I can't do all I did, I am satisfied because . I would rather be a has been than a never was . Speaking afterwards, Mrs Henshaw, said she chose to sing on her last day because ‘it’s always fun to do something a little different’. She also said that although the song was tongue-in-cheek, she wanted to make the point because she felt ‘quite able to carry on’ in her role. She told The Telegraph: ‘I don’t feel past it at all. I admit - a part of me would love to stay on because I feel I can still do the job, and I have a lot of experience. ‘And I do agree there has to be a cut off, but I don’t see why it can’t be at 75 rather than 70.’ As well as the assault case, Mrs Henshaw also dealt with cases of an assault with a weapon, a breach of an anti-molestation order and a breach of an Asbo during her last day. Frank Shipway, chairman of the bench at the Blackpool court, paid tribute to the hard-working JP. He said: ‘Karen has played a formidable role in promoting the work of the magistracy. ‘In all aspects of court life she will be nigh impossible to replace. ‘The decision that magistrates should retire at seventy was made at Government level.’ Another colleague added: ‘I have heard of the singing detective but never the singing magistrate. 'It took us by complete surprise but she has a lovely voice.’","Karen Henshaw broke into song on last day on bench at Blackpool court .

"By . Emma Glanfield . With its steel grey exterior and makeshift wooden ramp, it looks no more than a workman’s hut. But this small metal container is in fact a visitor centre which has opened at Colwyn Bay on the north Wales coast. Measuring no more than two by three metres, the ‘centre’ has been put in place to give the public an insight into the redevelopment of the beachfront. The new visitor centre at Colwyn Bay on the north Wales coast measure no more than two by three metres . Visitors have expressed their disappointment at the grey, metal container which overlooks the popular beach . The small hut has been opened to give visitors the chance to view plans for the area's ongoing redevelopment . However, the unit, which is situated near the once magnificent but now derelict Victoria Pier, has hardly been a hit with visitors. Since it was installed in April, it has faced a huge amount of backlash and its guest book has become full of sarcastic comments about its appearance. One visitor, called Philippa, wrote in the book: 'Was a bit c***, couldn't even get on the beach, got threatened and had to leave. Very disappointing.' Jane Blythe, visiting the waterfront from Prestatyn with her two children, said: 'I thought it was a joke at first. It does look very bleak. 'It's not exactly the most enticing sight but it does include information on the work. 'We had heard how good the beach was last summer so we didn't expect more work to be going on.' She added: 'It just seems funny to me that they use this little box as a visitor centre when the big building over there - Porth Eirias, a recently-built leisure centre - is pretty much empty.' Colwyn Bay is a popular resort on the north Wales coast and attracts thousands of visitors each year . One visitor from Penrhyn Bay said: 'Nice beach, nice weather, no access. Why does Conwy Council get everything the wrong way round? 'Hope this project is not another big white elephant like all the rest.' On Twitter, Clwyd West MP David Jones was equally scathing of the portable cabin. He wrote: 'How could anyone seriously think that would entice visitors in? 'Couldn't they use Porth Eirias as a temporary visitor centre? It's not as if there's a shortage of space there.' And Gareth Daniels, a tourism graduate who works for North Wales Tourism, wrote: 'How can you brand a destination as ""thriving"" or ""emerging"" when you have this greeting tourists?' A Conwy Council spokesman was unavailable for comment. Nestled at the foothills of Snowdonia and with the Pwllychrochan Woods as a backdrop, Colwyn Bay attracts thousands of visitors every year. Holidaymakers have a range of activities to choose from when staying at Colwyn Bay, including a visit to the Welsh Mountain Zoo, which is home to several endangered species, and the Theatr Colwyn – which is the oldest cinema in the UK. Nearby Conwy Castle, a World Heritage Site, is also a popular attraction for holidaymakers and groups of schoolchildren who travel from across the country to visit the medieval grounds. The seaside town of Colwyn Bay also boasts an award-winning beach with three miles of golden sand, making it popular with families.

"By . Emma Glanfield . American Pike, The Codfather and The Prawn Identity. These are just a few of the films which have been given a ‘fishy’ makeover by one creative design company. London-based Fishfinger has taken dozens of well-known film posters and created brilliant mock-ups of how they may have looked had the film focused a bit more on seafood and a bit less on A-list actors. From the likes of The Prawn Identity and Eel-T, to Jurassic Carp and Forrest Guppy, the designers have trawled through some of their favourite movies to come up with their own take. All of the original Hollywood posters have been made-over to include at least one type of fish whether it be cod, hake, pike, ling or prawns. Fishfinger's creative director Jeff Salmon, who is also the star of Channel 4's Four Rooms, said he set his team the quirky task after being inspired by watching A Fish Called Wanda. He said: ‘Quite simply, fish puns are Cod's gift to the British language. There is probably no better topic in our dictionary for word-play lovers - because you can have some Eel fun with them. ‘Not long ago I was sat on the beach in Barbados watching the tropical flying fish. Having just watched the classic movie A Fish Called Wanda on the plane over, and being a huge cinema fan, my mind started going. ‘So we set our loyal school of Fishfingerettes on Facebook and Twitter a challenge to come up with as many fishy film titles as they could. ‘And, after receiving such a Skate response, we decided to turn them into film posters - just for the Halibut, really.’ Fishfinger creative design agency has mocked-up a number of famous film posters with their own 'fishy' approach including The Godfather (left) and The Dream Team . Matt Damon may be the star of The Bourne series but the designers at Fishfinger opted to give the posters a 'prawn' makeover to include one of their favourite fish dishes . Jurassic Park has been transformed into Jurassic Carp and American Pie into American Pike in the mocked-up film posters by the London-based creative design agency . Hit 1990's film There's Something About Mary has been given a 'calamari' makeover (left) while King Kong has been replaced with a giant conger eel for the mock-up . Life of Pi has also received the 'fishy' treatment (left), as has Enemy at the Gates which has seen the whole poster transformed including the strapline (right) The mocked-up Cassablanca now features a giant bass while Disney classic James and the Giant Peach has been transformed to include a perch instead of the fruit . The designers mocked-up the quirky posters for fun. Pictured: Cabaret has become Crabaret while Godzilla has been transformed to include a leading star of a cod . White Men Can't Jump now features a bucket of white bait instead of a basketball (left), while The Matrix poster looks rather sinister with slimy-looking Hake (right) 10 things I hate about you has received its 'fishy' treatment in the form of hake, while City of God now centres on cod with several fish-related references on the poster . 1964 James Bond film Goldfinger has also been subjected to a makeover by the Fishfinger design team which opted to replace the title with its company name (above) All of the famous Hollywood posters have been made-over to include at least one type of fish.

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . More than 35 percent of Americans have debts and unpaid bills that have been reported to collection agencies, according to a study released Tuesday by the Urban Institute. These consumers fall behind on credit cards or hospital bills. Their mortgages, auto loans or student debt pile up, unpaid. Even past-due gym membership fees or cellphone contracts can end up with a collection agency, potentially hurting credit scores and job prospects, said Caroline Ratcliffe, a senior fellow at the Washington-based think tank. 'Roughly, every third person you pass on the street is going to have debt in collections,' Ratcliffe said. 'It can tip employers' hiring decisions, or whether or not you get that apartment.' Trouble: A new study by the Urban Institute found that 35.1 percent of people with credit records had been reported to collections for debt that averaged $5,178 . The study found that 35.1 percent of people with credit records had been reported to collections for debt that averaged $5,178, based on September 2013 records. The study points to a disturbing trend: The share of Americans in collections has remained relatively constant, even as the country as a whole has whittled down the size of its credit card debt since the official end of the Great Recession in the middle of 2009. As a share of people's income, credit card debt has reached its lowest level in more than a decade, according to the American Bankers Association. People increasingly pay off balances each month. Just 2.44 percent of card accounts are overdue by 30 days or more, versus the 15-year average of 3.82 percent. Yet roughly the same percentage of people are still getting reported for unpaid bills, according to the Urban Institute study performed in conjunction with researchers from the Consumer Credit Research Institute. Their figures nearly match the 36.5 percent of people in collections reported by a 2004 Federal Reserve analysis. All of this has reshaped the economy. The collections industry employs 140,000 workers who recover $50 billion each year, according to a separate study published this year by the Fed's Philadelphia bank branch. The delinquent debt is overwhelmingly concentrated in Southern and Western states. Texas cities have a large share of their populations being reported to collection agencies: Dallas (44.3 percent); El Paso (44.4 percent), Houston (43.7 percent), McAllen (51.7 percent) and San Antonio (44.5 percent). Almost half of Las Vegas residents— many of whom bore the brunt of the housing bust that sparked the recession— have debt in collections. All-time low: Surprisingly, just 2.44 percent of card accounts are overdue by 30 days or more, versus the 15-year average of 3.82 percent . Other Southern cities have a disproportionate number of their people facing debt collectors, including Orlando and Jacksonville, Florida; Memphis, Tennessee; Columbia, South Carolina; and Jackson, Mississippi. Other cities have populations that have largely managed to repay their bills on time. Just 20.1 percent of Minneapolis residents have debts in collection. Boston, Honolulu and San Jose, California, are similarly low. Only about 20 percent of Americans with credit records have any debt at all. Yet high debt levels don't always lead to more delinquencies, since the debt largely comes from mortgages. An average San Jose resident has $97,150 in total debt, with 84 percent of it tied to a mortgage.  But because incomes and real estate values are higher in the technology hub, those residents are less likely to be delinquent. By contrast, the average person in the Texas city of McAllen has only $23,546 in debt, yet more than half of the population has debt in collections, more than anywhere else in the United States. The Urban Institute's Ratcliffe said that stagnant incomes are key to why some parts of the country are struggling to repay their debt. Wages have barely kept up with inflation during the five-year recovery, according to Labor Department figures. And a separate measure by Wells Fargo found that after-tax income fell for the bottom 20 percent of earners during the same period.","35.1 percent of people with credit records had been reported to collections for debt that averaged $5,178 .

"By . Emma Glanfield . Jason Manford, 33, was blasted by fans as being 'insensitive' after making the comment on Facebook . Comedian Jason Manford has come under fire for joking that ‘Jews should have been given a bit of Germany’ after the Second World War. The 33-year-old, who has been embroiled in a number of controversies over recent years, caused outrage after posting the comment on his Facebook page. Many commenters blasted him for being ‘insensitive’ after he made the reference in a comment about the ongoing fighting between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza. He wrote: ‘I’m trying to read up on the Middle East situation but one question keeps popping up and I can’t find the answer. ‘When Britain & the UN were deciding on where to put the Jews, why didn’t they just give them a huge f****** bit of Germany instead of a country already occupied.’ Several people were quick to comment on the post, with one user, Gemma Berger, writing: ‘Did you really have to start this thread? This isn’t a laughing matter.’ In total the post attracted 1,493 comments and 518 shares before Manford added: ‘Wow actually getting serious informative replies from both sides, on a contentious delicate subject. Ah Facebook, you never cease to amaze me!’ It is thought he later deleted the post but took to his profile again to thank people for their response, suggesting he was ‘a little more informed than before’. The post came as the death toll in Gaza rose to 1,175, all of whom have died since the fighting began on July 8. Despite the criticism, one user appeared to welcome the debate and called for it to become a weekly event. Christine Dennison wrote on Manford’s Facebook page: ‘Bit off subject, but really interesting reading this morning regarding the conflict between Israel and Gaza. ‘Any chance of one serious topic a week? But please keep the funnies coming, loving seeing how wound up people can get!’ The comedian made the comment on his Facebook (top) before appearing surprised at the huge response . Manford has been at the centre of a few controversies over recent years. He was infamously sacked as presenter of BBC’s The One Show after it emerged he had internet sex sessions with a porn star and 12 fans. And last year he was in the spotlight again after allegedly exchanging 'hundreds of messages' with a woman while he was still married to his actress wife Catherine. The pair later confirmed they would be separating after six years of marriage.","Comedian blasted 'insensitive' by fans after making comment on Facebook .

"By . Emma Glanfield . A wannabe glamour model who received a free NHS breast enlargement has hit out at a decision to stop her taxpayer-funded taxi trips to take her children to school. Josie Cunningham, 23, who is heavily pregnant with her third child, started receiving the £6,000-a-year state-funded transport after complaining about the 'negative attention' she receives on public transport. However, Leeds City Council has now decided to axe the daily luxury – much to the annoyance of the expectant mother who once said: ‘Sticks and stones may break my bones but taxpayers will always fund me.’ She said today: 'If the council think I’m getting a bus, they can think again.' Scroll down for video . The 23-year-old wannabe glamour model, who is pregnant with her third child, started receiving the £6,000-a-year state-funded transport after complaining about the 'negative attention' she receives on public transport . Ms Cunningham, 23, shot to notoriety last year when she had an NHS-funded operation - worth £4,800 - to increase her bust from size 32A to 36DD, claiming she had been bullied since she was 14 for having a flat chest . Ms Cunningham shot to notoriety last year when she had a £4,800 NHS-funded operation to increase her bust from size 32A to 36DD, claiming she had been bullied since she was 14 for having a flat chest. She has since gone on to make a name for herself over the past 12 months by selling a number of stories, including how she received Botox on the NHS for a sweat problem and debated aborting her unborn baby for the chance to appear on Big Brother. Despite the controversy, she continued to soak up public funds by making the most of the state-funded taxis which drove her and her two children, aged three and six, the two-and-a-half mile journey to and from the local school, twice a day. She received the free transport on health grounds, after claiming the stress of unwanted ‘negative attention’ was giving her anxiety attacks. The journey, which she has been doing since May at a cost of £150-a-week, would only cost around £30-a-week by bus. It could be part of the reason why Leeds City Council has now decided to put an end to the twice-daily trips. The wannabe glamour model has previously boasted about the state-handouts she has received on Twitter . The 23-year-old is expecting her third child after falling pregnant while working as a £1,000-a-night escort . Ms Cunningham, from Leeds, said the council initially tried to halve the bill by taking her children to school with a chaperone – but pulled it altogether when she complained. She told The Sun: ‘They told me that if I wasn’t on the journey, the cost would be reduced. ‘I refused to let my kids get into a car with someone I’ve never met. I kicked off and they said the taxis would stop.’ Ms Cunningham said she would be appealing the decision and would even consider moving her children to a different school. It comes while she is heavily pregnant with her third child, who she fell pregnant with while working as a £1,000-a-night escort. She has previously admitted to not knowing who the father of her unborn child is and has also admitted to considering having the unborn baby aborted so she could appear on Channel 5’s Big Brother. Ms Cunningham, who formerly worked as an escort, caused controversy earlier this year after admitting that she had considered having her unborn baby aborted so she could appear on Channel 5’s Big Brother . She said she had been on the shortlist to appear on the reality television show - but was reluctant to proceed because of her pregnancy. It was while working as an escort that Ms Cunningham had the breast augmentation which she has become infamously known for. The operation was funded by the same NHS trust which refused to fund surgery that would have enabled a two-year-old girl with a form of cerebral palsy to walk.

"By . Emma Glanfield . This is the terrifying moment a balaclava-clad thief stormed into a betting shop and threatened staff with a two-foot long samurai-style sword.

"By . Emma Glanfield . A young man with the mental age of a nine-year-old was stabbed to death in a ‘shocking’ street attack over a North Face jacket, a court heard today. Dean Mayley, 24, was targeted for his jacket as he walked home in Greenford, west London, on February 7, the Old Bailey heard. Three teenagers got out of a waiting car and, while two blocked Mr Mayley’s path, another stabbed him once in the heart, jurors heard. Dean Mayley, 24, (pictured left with his nephew) was stabbed to death as he walked home in Greenford, west London, on February 7, the court heard. Mr Mayley suffered from microcephaly which made him 'vulnerable’ As the attackers made off in the car, passers-by went to help the victim who staggered into the road before he collapsed, the court heard. Mr Mayley, who suffered from brain disorder microcephaly which made him ‘trusting and vulnerable’, died in hospital less than two hours later. A post-mortem examination gave the cause of death as a single stab wound to the chest. Prosecutor Simon Denison QC said: ‘It may well be that Dean’s mental condition meant that he didn’t understand what was happening, or what they wanted. ‘But he didn’t hand them anything in the course of that confrontation.’ Four teenagers aged between 17 and 19 are on trial for the attempted robbery and murder of Mr Mayley. Mr Denison told jurors: ‘The evidence in this case will shock you. The attack on Dean Mayley was captured very clearly by a CCTV camera that overlooked the area of pavement where it happened. ‘You will, I’m afraid, see the footage of the way he was confronted and you will see (a 17-year-old defendant) stab him, and you will see him immediately stagger into the road and collapse as a result of the injury caused to him. ‘I have no doubt that it will shock you and make you angry. ‘You will, I am sure, as fellow human beings feel enormous sympathy for him and for his family, who have to cope with his sudden loss in these circumstances.’ Mr Mayley (right, pictured with his sister Emma) died of a single stab wound to the heart, a post-mortem found . But the prosecutor warned the jury to set aside these feelings and decide the issues ‘fairly and dispassionately’ on the evidence. He said all four defendants in the dock played a part in the murder. Mr Denison said: ‘All, you may think, depressingly young. ‘But all plenty old enough to pick on an innocent victim when they have a knife and all old enough to know what can happen when you stick a knife into someone.’ The 17-year-old who allegedly struck the fatal wound had only celebrated his birthday a few days before, the court heard. Another 17-year-old and Ryan Beresford, 19, stood in Mr Mayley’s way, and 18-year-old Michael Mensah drove them all to and from the scene, it was alleged. The prosecution linked Mensah to another mugging in the same area just days earlier in which a 15-year-old boy was forced to hand over his North Face bodywarmer and mobile phone. Four teenagers aged between 17 and 19 are on trial at the Old Bailey in London (above) for the attempted robbery and murder of Mr Mayley. They all deny murder in connection with the incident on February 7 . In the earlier incident, Mensah allegedly drove the robbers to the scene in his Fiat Punto, although the victim was unable to identify the two young men who then ran off. Mr Denison said: ‘Exactly the same area, same method, same sort of target, and same car - Michael Mensah’s car. ‘The other victim gave them what they wanted, and he was not physically harmed. ‘Dean Mayley didn’t. He is dead.’ Beresford, of Acton, west London, and Mensah, of Greenford, west London, along with the two 17-year-old boys, who cannot be named, all deny murder. Beresford, Mensah and one of the 17-year-olds deny attempted robbery. But the 17-year-old who allegedly stabbed Mr Mayley has admitted the charge of attempted robbery, the court heard. Menseh alone is accused of the earlier robbery on January 28. He denies the charge. The trial continues.

"By . Emma Glanfield . David Waygood was the sole director of a British-based company allegedly used by footballer Messi . A British banker who killed himself by stepping out in front of a train ran a company which allegedly helped footballer Lionel Messi dodge tax, it has emerged. David Waygood, who died last year aged 62, was the sole director of a firm which Spanish prosecutors claim hid tax owed by Messi. Earlier this week, a judge in Barcelona ruled that Messi, 27, and his father Jorge should be charged with tax evasion after prosecutors claimed the pair hid more than £3million in shell firms in the UK, Switzerland, Uruguay and Belize. One of the British firms  was looked after at the time by Mr Waygood, a banker who had previously worked for HSBC and NatWest. The Spanish prosecution alleged that the company held shares anonymously in a British-based nominee company. Rosie Sharp, from campaigner Global Witness, told The Mirror that nominees ‘own or control the company on behalf of someone else through hidden arrangements’. Mr Waygood committed suicide in April last year by standing in front of a train at a railway crossing in Otford, Kent. He had left a note for his children James and Lizzie which blamed stress. At an inquest into his death in October, a coroner returned a verdict of suicide. Messi and his father were accused last year of defrauding the Spanish state of £3.3million by filing false returns for the years 2006 to 2009. They have denied any wrongdoing. The Spanish court will now push ahead with the process of prosecuting the Argentina and Barcelona forward for the alleged tax evasion despite a recommendation from the public prosecutor that the charges be dismissed. The prosecutor argued in June that it was Messi’s father Jorge who was responsible for the family’s finances and not the four-time World Player of the Year.

Messi's father Jorge is also accused of tax fraud after allegedly being responsible for his family's finances . However, the court decided that Lionel could have known about and approved the creation of the shell companies which were allegedly used to evade the taxes due on income from image rights. As one of the world’s highest-paid athletes, Messi earns just over £31million a season in salary and bonuses, according to Forbes magazine, as well as about £18million from sponsors. The magazine has him as the fourth top-earning athlete behind boxer Floyd Mayweather, Real Madrid footballer Cristiano Ronaldo and basketball player LeBron James.","David Waygood was sole director of firm allegedly used by footballer Messi .

"By . Emma Glanfield . A 10-year-old boy has become the second youngster to die in a tragic river accident in two days after he fell into the water while on a family holiday. Schoolboy Arran Cooper, from Rutherglen in South Lanarkshire, died in hospital in the early hours of this morning after he fell into the River Orchy, in the Caledonian forest reserve in Argyll and Bute, Scotland. His death came less than 24 hours after 13-year-old Kyrece Francis drowned in the River Thames in Marlow, Buckinghamshire after apparently jumping in the fast-flowing water to retrieve a football. Arran Cooper, 10, from Rutherglen in South Lanarkshire, (left) died in hospital in the early hours of this morning after he fell into the River Orchy in Argyll and Bute. His death came after Kyrece Francis, 13, (right) was pulled from the River Thames in Marlow, Buckinghamshire after apparently drowning while trying to retrieve a ball . Both of the boys' deaths came as schools across the country broke up for the summer holidays. Aaron had been on holiday in the forest reserve with his parents when the tragedy occurred at about 1.45pm yesterday. A doctor who was also on holiday in the area saw the incident and swam across the river to help him after he got into difficulty, police said. An RAF search and rescue helicopter, air ambulance and Police Scotland helicopter all attended the scene after a major rescue operation – also involving a Coastguard rescue team and forest rangers – was launched. The youngster was rescued from the remote river by emergency services before being flown in the RAF Sea King helicopter to Southern General Hospital in Glasgow. However, he was later transferred to the city's specialist Yorkhill Hospital by ambulance, where he died in the early hours of this morning. A Police Scotland spokesman said: ‘At 1.45pm yesterday a 10-year-old boy fell into the River Orchy near to Allt Broighleachan in the Caledonian forest reserve, Glen Orchy. Arran Cooper was on holiday with his family when he fell into the River Orchy (pictured), in the Caledonian forest reserve in Argyll and Bute, Scotland. He was flown to hospital from the scene but died in hospital . ‘He was rescued from the water and flown to Yorkhill Hospital in Glasgow for treatment. ‘He died in the early hours of Wednesday July 23. ‘A report will be submitted to the procurator fiscal.’ In a similar tragedy, promising footballer Kyrece drowned on the second day of the school holidays after apparently trying to retrieve a ball. The schoolboy is believed to have died after getting into difficulty in the fast-flowing River Thames in Buckinghamshire at about 4.30pm yesterday. Today family, friends and teachers from Great Marlow School - where Kyrece studied - gathered for a brief memorial and to pay tribute to the popular pupil. The acting headmaster of Great Marlow School, Linton Nash, paid tribute to Kyrece, who had only been a pupil for nine months. He said: 'Kyrece Marshall-Francis was a charming and friendly young man, who was kind, respectful and sociable. A . specialist search and rescue team scoured the River Thames in Marlow, . Buckinghamshire yesterday after a 999 call reported 13-year-old Kyrece Francis as being in difficulty. His body was later pulled from the river . Kyrece Francis is believed to have drowned after getting into difficulty in the river about 4.30pm yesterday . 'Although he only joined the school nine months ago, he had already made a wide circle of friends and made a fantastic impact, especially in sport.' Mr Nash added: 'Kyrece was a wonderful presence in his tutor group and set a great example to his peers with 100 per cent attendance and one of the highest number of reward points for effort, behaviour and supporting other pupils in his class. 'He had chosen his GCSE options for Year 10, including both PE and Drama at which he excelled. The whole school community will be devastated that Kyrece has died at so young an age and in such tragic circumstances. 'Everyone's thoughts are with his family and friends who can rely on our support as they begin to come to terms with his loss.' The alarm was raised yesterday when a friend of Kyrece dialled 999 on his mobile phone to say that the boy had gone under the water and had failed to resurface. It was believed he was swept downstream by the fast flowing current and his body was eventually found near the village of Bourne End. Friends who were at the scene when the tragedy happened wrote on social media that before he disappeared beneath the surface for the last time, Kyrece shouted to his pals: 'I love you all.' One woman broke down in tears as she read the tributes left to popular schoolboy Kyrece Francis, 13 . More than 100 friends visited Great Marlow School today to pay tribute to Kyrece, with many leaving flowers . His mother, Simone Francis, wearing a bright blue football shirt, today hugged her son's devastated friends and looked at the mass of flowers that had been laid in tribute to the young Chelsea fan. Kyrece's stepfather, Lewis Cooke, and his sister and step siblings were also said to have been present. Three teenagers, softly spoken friends of Kyrece, addressed the mourners. One said: 'The amount of people here shows how much everybody loved and respected Kyrece.' Among the sea of flowers left at the gates of Great Marlow School were school shirts, teddy bears, balloons and flags. One teacher, who declined to be named, said: 'He was a very popular boy. This is a lovely school and this is a testament of that. They were all very respectful.' The body of the teenager was discovered by officers from the force's Specialist Search and Rescue Team shortly after 8pm last night. Kyrece's mother, Simone Francis, was comforted by family members outside Great Marlow School today as dozens of pupils, relatives and friends paid tribute to the promising footballer who drowned yesterday . Several of Kyrece's friends appeared inconsolable as they gathered outside his school to pay tribute to him . Friends of Kyrece took to Twitter and Facebook to express their shock and sadness at his death. One pal wrote: 'People are saying his body ended up being found in Bourne End. Shows how fast and strong that current was. They continued: 'Also that before the last time he went under and did not come back up he said to Nathan, Josh, and Jamie etc. “Love you all"".' 'I miss and love this guy so much he was just amazing and my love and respect goes out to his family mostly but also to his loving girlfriend. . . you just gotta keep your chin up.' Kyrece was a pupil at Great Marlow School, which broke up for the summer holidays last week. Police said neither of the deaths are believed to be suspicious and officers are preparing reports on both incidents to hand over to the coroner.","Arran Cooper fell into River Orchy in Argyll and Bute at lunchtime yesterday .

"By . Emma Glanfield . Wendy Wiffen, 48, from Rainham, Essex, started suffering from pagophobia - a fear of ice and snow- after slipping on ice when she was pregnant in 1985 . A woman who spent 29 years living with a fear of ice and snow has told how successful treatment to cure the rare phobia has left her feeling like she has ‘won the lottery.’ Wendy Wiffen, 48, from Rainham, Essex, started suffering from pagophobia - a fear of ice and snow - after slipping on ice when she was pregnant in 1985. The mother-of-three’s phobia was so severe that she couldn’t look at ice cubes or ice lollies, buy frozen food, venture out in the snow or cope with ice crunch sounds like egg shells and crisps. She even suffered anxiety when watching Dancing on Ice and ended up locking herself in her bedroom whenever it was on television or running out of shops if she saw it on magazine covers. However, following treatment from psychotherapists, Mrs Wiffen claims she has now been cured of the phobia which has ruled her life for so long. She said one of the things she was now looking forward to doing the most was treating her grandchildren to an ice-lolly - something she claims she has never been able to do in the past. She said: ‘It’s better than winning the lottery. I feel free. Like a giant weight has been lifted. ‘It may sound ridiculous to some people, but being able to have ice in my drink on a hot day feels like a miracle. ‘Before treatment I wasn’t even able to stand near anybody who had ice in their glass. ‘A cool drink was out of the question but now there will be no more warm drinks for me. ‘I’ve even been able to walk down the frozen food aisle in the supermarket for the first time in nearly 30 years. ‘I can’t believe it myself. It is so liberating.’ The mother of three now claims to be cured of her phobia after appearing on ITV's This Morning and receiving treatment from psychotherapists Nik and Eva Speakman . Following treatment from psychotherapists, Mrs Wiffen claims she has now been cured of the phobia which has ruled her life for so long. She could be seen on the show stood next to ice and touching ice cubes . Mrs Wiffen was cured during a live appearance on ITV’s This Morning after producers read about her plight on MailOnline and invited her on air for treatment. Her story first emerged last year when she told how she tried to seek help from her GP after being trapped in her home in the cold weather. It was thought her phobia stemmed from slipping on ice when she was seven months pregnant with the eldest of her three children, who are now aged 28, 25 and 21. She said she slipped while walking to the shops and was left fearing her unborn son had been harmed. At the time, she told how she was left virtually housebound in cold weather because of her fear and had to stock up on groceries to avoid going out in the snow. She also told how she was becoming increasingly upset that her phobia was preventing her from taking part in activities like snowman building and sledging with her grandchildren. Mrs Wiffen said one of the things she was now looking forward to doing was to treat her grandchildren to an ice-lolly - something she claims she has never been able to do in the past . She said: ‘It ruled my life, summer and winter, it never left me and I was at my wits end. I beat bowel cancer but I could not beat this phobia. ‘I used to dread the hot weather because I knew that meant the ice cream van would come round and all the kids would be having ice lollies. Pagophobia is an intense and irrational fear of ice and frost, which can be triggered by a traumatic event, including slipping on snow. In extreme cases, individuals refuse to leave home in such weather conditions and avoid anything frozen. The word derives from the Greek phrase ‘paggos’ meaning ice and ‘phobos’ meaning fear. Symptoms can vary from mild anxiety to full-blown panic attacks and nausea, causing major disruption to everyday life. If left untreated, the anxiety can become completely debilitating. Treatment follows the usual recommendations for dealing with a phobia, which include: . In severe cases, prescribed medication for anxiety. ‘I couldn’t even stand to hear ice clinking in glasses. I’d have to drink warm drinks.’ Mrs Wiffen even nearly missed her own wedding with husband Peter four years ago when forecasters predicted snow. She said: ‘He knew I wouldn’t make if it snowed. I wanted to do the ceremony over the phone.’ However, she now believes the phobia is a problem of her past after receiving treatment on the daytime show on Friday. Viewers saw her burst into tears when hosts Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield showed her an ice cube before treatment and a nurse had to be called after her blood pressure rocketed and she almost fainted. However, after just 40 minutes of . treatment with psychotherapists Nik and Eva Speakman she went back on . air to demonstrate how she was able to touch an ice cube and even bite . an ice-lolly. Speaking after . the treatment, she said: ‘I want people to know this treatment can . work, it can change your life like it has mine. ‘I . am so pleased I went for it. I never thought I could be cured but I . can’t wait to make the most of my life without this phobia hanging over . me.’ Mrs Speakman said the phobia was the worst she had ever treated live on air. Mrs Wiffen even suffered anxiety when watching Dancing on Ice and ended up locking herself in her bedroom whenever it was on television or running out of shops if she saw coverage of it on the front of magazine covers . She said: ‘Wendy’s fear of ice was without doubt the most severe phobia we have attempted to treat under these conditions. ‘With that in mind and only a short time to work with her we had no idea what was going to work or not but Wendy responded so well to our therapy. ‘She realised she was blaming the snow and ice for something that never happened. ‘She was very shocked not to have these feelings that had dominated her life for so long. ‘It’s hugely rewarding to see the difference it is making to her life already.'","Wendy Wiffen developed phobia of ice and snow after slipping on ice in 1985 .

"By . Emma Glanfield . Josie Cunningham had apparently been in talks with a pound shop to sell DVDs of her third child's birth . Controversial wannabe glamour model Josie Cunningham has taken to Twitter to vent her anger after a pound shop ‘pulled out’ of a deal to sell DVDs of her upcoming child’s birth. The heavily-pregnant single mother, who provoked national outrage after getting a boob job on the NHS, had apparently been in talks with a pound shop to sell DVDs of her third child’s birth. However, the 23-year-old, from Leeds, appeared to confirm the deal would no longer be going ahead today by tweeting: ‘Actually fuming!!!!!!! As if a poundshop has just pulled out of my child birth DVD deal!!!!!!!! So, angry!!!’ Ms Cunningham shot to notoriety last year when she had a £4,800 NHS-funded operation to increase her bust from size 32A to 36DD, claiming she had been bullied since she was 14 for having a flat chest. She has since gone on to make a name for herself over the past 12 months by selling a number of stories, including how she received Botox on the NHS for her sweat problem and debated aborting her unborn baby for the chance to appear on Big Brother. Talk of her latest money-spinner - a possible DVD of her child’s birth - was announced in May, when she said: ‘By selling DVDs of the birth, people will get to see my maternal side. I love One Born Every Minute - it'll be just like that.’ However, after receiving backlash when seemingly confirming the deal was over today, she responded by posting: ‘People may laugh, but think about it! 500 stores x 500 copies each equals a s**t loads of £’s! (sic)’ She later informed her fans she was going shopping because ‘retail therapy’ was the only way to ‘make herself feel better’. A representative for Ms Cunningham was unable to confirm which pound store she had been in talks with and said: ‘Sadly we cannot give any more information at this time. ‘We entered an agreement in the early stages agreeing not to name the store until the deal was finalised. The 23-year-old, from Leeds, appeared to confirm the DVD deal would no longer be going ahead today . Ms Cunningham, 23, shot to notoriety last year when she had an NHS-funded operation - worth £4,800 - to increase her bust from size 32A to 36DD, claiming she had been bullied since she was 14 for having a flat chest . ‘Sadly I can only refer to it as a pound store, if it’s any help.... we can rule out the 99p store.’ Ms Cunningham has previously admitted to not knowing who the father of her unborn child is, claiming she fell pregnant while working as a £1,000-a-night escort. She has also admitted to considering having her unborn baby aborted so she could appear on Channel 5’s Big Brother. She said she had been on the shortlist to appear on the reality television show - but was reluctant to proceed because of her pregnancy. Glamour model Ms Cunningham, who posted this scan of her baby on her Twitter feed, was apparently in talks to film a DVD of the child's birth and sell it in pound stores across the UK . Ms Cunningham has previously admitted to not knowing who the father of her unborn child is, claiming to have fallen pregnant while working as a £1,000-a-night escort . It was while working as an escort that Ms Cunningham had the breast augmentation which she has become infamously known for. The operation was funded by the same NHS trust which refused to fund surgery that would have enabled a two-year-old girl with a form of cerebral palsy to walk. After the enlargement, Ms Cunningham claimed her breasts were ‘so big’ she found them embarrassing, and enraged the nation further by claiming the NHS should pay for a reduction. The retired escort celebrated her pregnancy with a naked pregnancy shoot, showing off her stomach tattoo . The wannabe glamour model has previously caused outrage by posting controversial tweets, including this one . She then tried to placate public opinion by promising to pay back the cash but admitted she could not uphold her pledge when she fell pregnant. She now continues to soak up public funds and even receives state-funded transport to take her children to school because of the 'negative attention' she receives on public transport. It means that since May, she and her children have been driven in taxis the two-and-a-half miles to and from the local school, twice a day. The journey would cost around £30 a week by bus.","Wannabe glamour model was apparently in deal to film DVD of child's birth .

"By . Emma Glanfield . Mr Justice Peter Jackson (pictured) said 'necessary restraint' could take place for the woman's operation . A judge today ruled that surgeons could perform a hysterectomy on a mentally ill woman who is detained at a specialist hospital after concluding that she is unable to make decisions about her treatment. Mr Justice Peter Jackson said ‘necessary restraint’ could take place for the operation, which he said was in the 36-year-old woman’s best interests after analysing evidence at a hearing in London. Sitting in the Court of Protection - which handles cases involving sick and vulnerable people - the judge ruled that the woman, who is detained under the terms of mental health legislation, was not capable of making decisions about her treatment. His ruling came after a specialist told him the woman needed treatment due to her medical problems getting worse and affecting her mental health. Mr Justice Peter Jackson said: ‘This is not in any sense an operation being carried out on a protesting patient with the use of heavy restraint. ‘This is an operation that in my view (she) will be relieved to have. The level of security that is going to be needed is no more than is going to be necessary to reassure her.’ He had heard legal argument from lawyers representing health authority officials and the woman, who all agreed the woman should have a hysterectomy. The judge was told that the main disadvantage would be that the woman would lose her ability to bear children and he said it was a major consideration. But he said that disadvantage was outweighed by her need for treatment. He was told that she was likely to be . detained for some years and said that because of the ‘extremely . difficult’ circumstances she was in, her inability to become pregnant . would not be a ‘significant detriment’ to her. The methods which might be needed to restrain the woman were not discussed at today’s hearing. The Court of Protection is part of the High Court and analyses issues relating to sick and vulnerable people . Mr Justice Peter Jackson said she had already visited a hospital for an assessment and said staff from the unit where she was detained had accompanied her on the visit, which had gone ‘pretty smoothly’. He said neither the woman, her location, nor any hospital where she was treated, could be identified. The Court of Protection makes decisions and appoints deputies to act on behalf of individuals who are sick and vulnerable and unable to make informed decisions about their personal health, finance or welfare.","Mr Justice Peter Jackson said 'necessary restraint' may be used in operation .

"By . Emma Glanfield . The boss of a filthy Chinese takeaway where rats ran riot while staff smoked cigarettes in food preparation areas has been fined. Shi Le Zhang, 42, who ran 88 Noodle Bar in Huddersfield, pleaded guilty to four breaches of food safety and hygiene regulations when he appeared at Kirklees Magistrates’ Court. Magistrates heard how rat droppings were found in the takeaway and food preparation areas - which included the outside back yard - were filthy. Magistrates heard how rats were found in the takeaway and food preparation areas were extremely dirty (above). Investigators also heard freezer temperatures were not at the right level and food was left exposed . Shi Le Zhang, 42, pleaded guilty to four breaches of food safety and hygiene regulations when he appeared at Kirklees Magistrates' Court after the prosecution told how 88 Noodle Bar in Huddersfield had a rat infestation . The court was told that standards of the takeaway – which currently has a zero rating for hygiene - slipped after its chefs left the country for the Chinese New Year celebrations. Miles Barker, prosecuting on behalf of Kirklees Council, said that the town centre premises had been known to the Environmental Health service since at least 2006. He explained that the business had never scored more than a two out of five in the Food Standards Agency’s scores on doors ratings. On the evening of January 29 the council’s officers went to the takeaway and found that food was being stored and prepared outside in the rear yard. Mr Barker said: ‘It has a known rat infestation which is not uncommon in Huddersfield now due to the ageing of the properties. ‘The rats appear to thrive on access to rubbish from businesses around there.’ Investigators found that food was being prepared and stored in an outside yard to the rear of 88 Noodle Bar in Huddersfield (above), which is described as a 'prominent and popular' takeaway in the town centre area . The court was told that standards at 88 Noodle Bar in Huddersfield town centre - which currently has a zero rating for hygiene - slipped after its chefs left the country for the Chinese New Year celebrations . Magistrates heard that part of this area was sectioned off with a wall, gates and a corrugated roof. Mr Barker said: ‘It was clear that food was being stored and prepared there. ‘A metal table had a bucket of chopped pork and two buckets of vegetables. ‘There was food debris and peelings in a tray and fridge freezers and shelves. ‘There was evidence of rat activity outside and rat droppings were found in various locations.’ Mr Barker said that there was evidence of smoking in this area and it was an offence to smoke in a food preparation area. There was also no hot water in the kitchen hand wash basin and dishcloths where food was being prepared were so dirty that they had to be thrown away. Plastic boxes of cooked rice sat at 210C and large amounts of other food had been left out at room temperature, providing a breeding ground for bacteria. The freezer was not running at the correct temperature and food including fried eggs were left uncovered on shelves. Mr Barker added: ‘Raw meat was defrosting in washing up bowls not designated as raw meat only. Due to his limited means magistrates ordered Zhang to pay £150 fine as well as £500 prosecution costs . The court heard how there was no hot water in the kitchen hand wash basin and dishcloths where food was being prepared were so dirty that they had to be thrown away . ‘Filters were missing from an extraction canopy so there was no way of removing moisture and grease from the air. ‘This attracts dirt and germs and also presents a fire safety hazard. ‘It wasn’t being cleaned frequently enough and the officers were very disappointed in what they found.’ Zhang, who said he is now just a chef at the takeaway, closed it down immediately and had it cleaned. With the aid of a Mandarin interpreter, he told the court: ‘It was the Chinese New Year and some of the chefs went back to China. ‘Other part time staff tried to cover and for a month made a mess of it.’ Magistrates told him they were concerned about the public safety of the business, which they described as prominent and popular with students. Due to his limited means they ordered him to pay a £150 fine as well as £500 prosecution costs.","Shi Le Zhang guilty of four breaches of food safety and hygiene regulations .

"By . Emma Glanfield . A wild beaver which is one of the first to be seen in Britain for centuries has given birth to three young. Two adult beavers, one juvenile and the three young, known as kits, are now believed to be living in the River Otter in Devon. The beavers were originally found to be living in the east Devon river in July last year when dog walker Lorna Douglas, 35, spotted one swimming around. Scroll down for video . Two adult beavers, one juvenile and three young - known as kits - are now believed to be living on the River Otter in Devon. Two adult beavers were first spotted in the river in July last year by dogwalker Lorna Douglas . After being spotted last year, retired environmental scientist Tom Buckley set up three infra-red cameras to film the beavers, which led to the recent discovery that one had given birth to three young (above) Following the sighting, retired environmental scientist Tom Buckley set up three infra-red cameras – which take photographs when they sense movement – along a stretch of the river. He has caught them on camera several times since January and they have been filmed grooming themselves, gnawing at the base of trees and happily playing together. The government had originally said the beavers would be rehomed, as they could be carrying a disease, but wildlife campaigners now hope to get permission for them to stay. Mr Buckley, who discovered the beavers had mated after spotting the young on his latest footage, said: ‘I was so excited to see the female and the kit. It's fantastic stuff. ‘Our baby beavers have been born free and their freedom should not be taken away by imprisoning them in a zoo. ‘I'd be extremely disappointed if the government did that.’ Devon Wildlife Trust said it was working to get a licence from Natural England for the ‘non-native species’ to remain on the river. Campaigners are trying to get a licence from Natural England for the 'non-native species' to stay on the river . Experts think the beavers most likely escaped from a private collection, rather than being released deliberately . Sightings of the animals in the River Otter were believed to be the first of their kind for 800 years. Their presence suggests that beavers may be breeding outside captivity for the first time in centuries. Beavers were once common throughout Britain but were hunted to extinction in England and Wales 800 years ago due to their highly valued fur, meat and for castoreum – a secretion of the animal’s scent gland which was used as a headache cure. The ast few British beavers were hunted to extinction during the 16th century. To return the creatures to the UK, conservationists have reintroduced them by using close relatives from Norway. Between May 2009 and September 2010, the Scottish Beaver Trial released four family groups and one pair of beavers into Knapdale Forest, Argyll. More recently, beavers have been reintroduced in captive areas as part of breeding programs including at Ottery St Mary and Gloucestershire - but none are unaccounted for and the River Otter beavers are thought to have escaped from a private collection. They remained in Scotland but disappeared from the UK completely 400 years ago. Experts think the beavers in the River Otter most likely escaped from a private collection, rather than being released deliberately. The Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs said the government was taking ‘precautionary actions’ amid fears the animals could be carrying a disease ‘not currently present in the UK’. ‘We are taking precautionary action by testing the beavers,’ a spokesman said. ‘This will be done with their welfare in mind.’ He added the department would wait until the kits were a suitable age before testing them for disease. There are two species of beaver - the European and North American. Lorna Douglas first spotted the wild beaver in the River Otter last July and managed to take a photo (above) In recent months, the beavers have been filmed grooming . themselves, gnawing trees and playing together . The adult beavers and their young have been living beside the River Otter in Devon since at least July last year . The European is considered ‘vulnerable’ and is extinct in most of Western Europe, with around 700,000 living in the wild in territories stretching from Eastern Europe to the Chinese and Mongolian borders. There were several attempts to breed American and European beavers to boost numbers of the European species, until scientists realised they are genetically incompatible. Conservationists have since introduced several small groups of beavers back into captivity in the UK, but this is thought to be the first group found living in the wild.","Beavers living in River Otter, Devon were first to be seen in UK in 800 years .

The 17-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, stole the £12,000 Ford C-Max during a burglary at a house just five miles away before crashing it into the luxury detached property which is owned by Carl Fogarty . Blackpool Youth Court heard how the teenager had been . drinking prior to the burglary and crash on June 7. The youth admitted burgling a house in the early hours and . stealing the Ford’s keys as the owner’s daughter and boyfriend were upstairs.

"By . Emma Glanfield . Ann Holding, 48, hanged herself in a barn in October last year after convincing herself she was pregnant . A mother who convinced herself she was pregnant hanged herself a week after her doctor reassured her she wasn’t expecting. Ann Holding, 48, hanged herself in a barn after believing she was between three and four months pregnant - despite having just received a negative pregnancy test result. The cleaner, from Cadbury, Devon, had complained to doctors she felt ‘bloated and had backache’, which she believed were symptoms of being pregnant. She also told her GP that she ‘felt something moving inside her’ and thought she was three or four months pregnant even though she had a flat abdomen, an inquest into her death heard. Her husband Steven told the hearing, held at Exeter County Hall today, that her concern may have stemmed from the fact that she did not realise she was pregnant with her daughter, who was born in 1987. He said: ‘She was wearing size 10 jeans and carried on working. ‘The day before she was banging in some fence stakes and helped me with a mobile disco. It showed what a strong and determined lady she was.’ He also told the hearing how their relationship had been affected in 2012 when his wife started to worry about paying heating bills and keeping warm in their home. He said she went to bed dressed in clothes and he said he did not ‘attempt sexual advances’ because of her problems but admitted she may have ‘read the wrong thing into it’. He said his wife had never harmed herself or contemplated suicide before but was found hanged at a barn in Rackenford, Devon, in October last year. At an inquest at Exeter County Hall (above), Devon coroner Dr Elizabeth Earland recorded a verdict of suicide and said that farmer's daughter Ann Holding was 'increasingly overwhelmed by the pressures of daily living' Family members said the couple had not been getting on but ‘would not expand any further’. Her sister said she was ‘busy active person who would never say no to anyone who wanted any help’. Devon coroner Dr Elizabeth Earland, recording a verdict of suicide, said the farmer’s daughter was ‘increasingly overwhelmed by the pressures of daily living’ and intended to take her own life.","Ann Holding, 48, convinced herself she was three or four months pregnant .

"By . Emma Glanfield . Emily Pike, 23, has been jailed for 18 months for perverting the course of justice after claiming she was raped by Tom Mills, 24, at a hotel in Bristol . An internet dater who cried rape when a man crept out of a hotel room after they had sex because she didn’t match her online profile has been jailed. Emily Pike, 23, met Tom Mills online before they arranged to meet in person at a Premier Inn at Cribbs Causeway in Bristol to spend the night together. However, after deciding Pike didn’t match the description on her dating profile, Mr Mills fled the hotel and later sent her a text to say he was helping a friend in an emergency. Pike then contacted the police and claimed the 24-year-old had raped her in the hotel and car park . However, CCTV images proved she was lying and she was jailed for 18 months at Bristol Crown Court for perverting the course of justice. In sentencing yesterday, Judge Julian Lambert told her: ‘You know it is wrong to lie and it is wrong to lie and get somebody into trouble. Lie about rape and you are getting somebody into big trouble. ‘Whether you couldn’t learn, or you didn’t learn, your web of falsehoods led to a young man being arrested for rape. ‘He was at risk of many years of prison and he spent 12 hours in custody.’ The court heard how the pair had initially arranged to meet in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, for a sexual tryst in October 2011. But when they couldn’t find a room they checked into the Premier Inn at Cribbs Causeway, Bristol, to have sex. However, Pike awoke after the encounter to find Mr Mills had vanished. Anna Midgley, prosecuting, said: ‘After he left Miss Pike alone she tried to call him. He sent her texts, saying he had to help a friend in accident and emergency. ‘After, she called the police. She made an allegation he raped her. ‘She said she had consensual phone sex and when she arrived at the Premier Inn he forced himself on her. ‘She said they left together and he raped her a second time in the passenger seat of his car.’ Pike arranged to meet Mr Mills at a Premier Inn in Bristol after chatting with him on an online dating site. However, after they had consensual sex, he fled the hotel and later texted saying his friend had an emergency . Mr Mills was arrested and subjected to medical samples, swabs and hours of questioning, the court heard. But when police looked at the hotel CCTV, they saw the pair did not leave together and telephone messages did not back up Pike’s claims. The court heard Pike, from Caerphilly, south Wales, has 15 previous convictions which include an earlier false rape claim which she had apologised for. James Tucker, defending Pike, said she had a history for telling ‘fantastic lies’ and also claimed to have married a man in Iraq. ‘She understands what she is doing is intended to pervert the course of justice. Why she is doing it is seemingly lost upon her,’ he said, adding she had a personality disorder issues. ‘She is an incredibly vulnerable person. ‘She . is acutely vulnerable at her own hands. Prison will punish her and open . her eyes as to understanding why she is offending in the way she is.’ After Mr Mills left the Premier Inn at Cribbs Causeway, Bristol (above), Pike contacted police and claimed he had raped her. She was found to be making up the claim after CCTV footage proved the allegations were false . After the court hearing, Detective Constable Richard Worrin said: ‘We take all reports of sexual assault and rape very seriously and this case should not deter people with genuine complaints coming forward to us. ‘In this case, the allegations of rape were proved untrue through CCTV evidence and not by Emily Pike’s own admission. ‘I would like to stress that prosecutions such as this are extremely rare but false allegations of rape undermine the experiences of actual victims and can have a devastating impact on those who are wrongly accused.’","Emily Pike met Tom Mills online before arranging to meet at Premier Inn .

"By . Emma Glanfield . This terrifying footage shows the moment a workman ran for his life after his white van, containing combustible materials, exploded in the middle of a busy street. The van, which had roofing materials including resin and fibre glass stored in the back, erupted into a ball of flames while parked in front of a row of shops in Blackpool, Lancashire. CCTV footage of the incident shows the workman securing ladders to the top of the vehicle before smoke starts to creep from the back and an explosion blows one of the back doors open. Scroll down for video . Smoke started pouring from the white van, which had roofing materials including resin and fibre glass stored in the back, before it burst into flames while parked in Blackpool, Lancashire . CCTV footage of the incident shows the workman ducking out of the way as an explosion blows one of the back doors of the van open . The van soon became engulfed in flames, while parked outside some shops in Blackpool, and the owner was forced to run for cover . In the footage, captured from a shop’s security camera, the roofer can be seen running out of the way as thick black smoke pours from the front window and the whole van becomes completely engulfed in flames. Passers-by can also be seen running out of the way before firefighters arrive at the scene in Queen Street to extinguish the blaze. The incident, which occurred at 9.50am on July 7, forced police to close several nearby roads amid fears of the fire spreading or further explosions. However, the incident was soon brought under control and police confirmed no one was injured in the blaze. A spokesman for Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service said the fire was deemed an accident and said it was possible a chemical reaction occurred between the two materials. The fire tore through the van and was made worse by flammable materials which were stored in the back . The incident, which occurred at 9.50am on July 7, forced police to close several nearby roads . Paul Harrison, crew manager at Blackpool Fire Station, said fire chiefs couldn't pinpoint the exact cause of the blaze but said it wasn't malicious or arson . Paul Harrison, crew manager at Blackpool Fire Station, said fire chiefs couldn’t pinpoint the exact cause of the blaze but said it wasn’t malicious or arson. He said: ‘There was no evidence at the scene to suggest it was a deliberate fire. ‘There is potential the resins inside the van could have self-heated but there was definitely no sign of forced entry of arson. ‘The van was engulfed in flames when we arrived and it took about 30 to 40 minutes to get the fire under control. Firefighters spent around 30 to 40 minutes trying to get the van blaze under control and nearby roads had to be closed to motorists amid fears of the fire spreading or a further explosion . A spokesman for Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service said the fire was deemed an accident and said it was possible a chemical reaction occurred between the two materials . Lancashire Constabulary said the incident was not being investigated by police as it was deemed an accident and not a criminal offence . ‘It was parked close to some shops so it caused a bit of heat damage to the shop fronts and the van was completely damaged. ‘While we couldn’t figure out exactly how it happened, the flammable liquids in the back would’ve contributed and accelerated the fire. ‘Even if it had started in the engine compartment, as it passed through the vehicle the resin would’ve accelerated the fire. ‘If workmen are carrying flammable materials, they should be aware to keep flammable liquids out of direct sunlight because potentially they could catch fire.’ Lancashire Constabulary said the incident was not being investigated by police as it was deemed an accident and not a criminal matter.

Only Turkey recognises the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state that was proclaimed in the north. The July invasion resulted in some 37 per cent of the island being captured by Turkish forces before a ceasefire was announced. UN . peacekeepers have patrolled the area for years to try and prevent . clashes between the populations of the two halves of the island.","Soldier Yiannakis Savva Liasis went missing during Turkish invasion in 1974 .

Her agent Barry Tomes revealed last month she had been offered to host a show which will follow her teaching Brits how to cook on a tight budget. The show - if given the go ahead - could land her £20,000 for a six episode run, he said. Mr Tomes said her visit to France is her first time in a professional kitchen ahead of her bid to become the 'next Rustie Lee'. TV chef Rustie became famous for her loud and outgoing style on her appearances in the 1980s breakfast show TV-am, and later had her own cooking programme. The Birmingham mother-of-two, who is rumoured to have had some of her benefits frozen after it emerged she was being paid to do promotional work, has been receiving around £20,000 a year in welfare payments. The single mother angered taxpayers after insisting she would continue claiming handouts until the Government stops her. Last month it was also reported she had turned down four job opportunities, claiming they were 'too boring' among other excuses.

She is reportedly receiving £214 a week from a combination of Employment and Support Allowance - formerly known as incapacity benefit - child tax credit and child benefit, plus £500 a month in housing benefit. Dee said she does feel guilty about claiming handouts, maintaining it is her depression that has stopped her from taking on full-time roles. A decision on whether her benefits will be withdrawn is expected to be announced in July. Mr Tomes said that the Department for Work and Pensions had requested an earlier meeting with the television star, but said she was unable to make it as it coincided with a public appearance at a pool party in Magaluf. After repeatedly claiming that she is too depressed to work, Dee claimed her Magaluf trip in May was a pick-me-up for which she was not paid.","The self-styled 'dole queen' is currently in Saint-Paul-le-Gaultier, France .

"By . Emma Glanfield . Ross Conlin, 29, was handed a life sentence at Winchester Crown Court for murder . A father who killed his four-month-old daughter by ‘vigorously shaking’ her after smoking cannabis and losing his temper has been jailed for a minimum of 17 years. Ross Conlin, 29, shook baby Kiera so violently ‘in anger’ while left alone with her that she had a heart attack and stopped breathing. Examinations revealed the youngster also suffered three skull fractures, rib fractures and bleeding to the brain in the lead up to her death in Farnborough, Hampshire, on May 6 last year. Today, wearing a Marvel comic t-shirt and jeans, Conlin closed his eyes and put his head in his hands as he was imprisoned for life at Winchester Crown Court. Earlier a jury of nine men and three women convicted the debt collector of murder and three counts of causing grievous bodily harm. He was handed a life sentence by the judge and told he will serve a minimum of 17-and-a-half years in prison before being led away by two security guards. His partner, and Kiera’s mother, Kelly-Marie Rayner, 26, was earlier acquitted in court of a charge of causing or allowing the death of a child. Nigel Lickley QC, prosecuting, told the jury how the defendants were staying with Rayner’s parents during the weekend of Kiera’s death. Conlin had been left in charge of Kiera, while Rayner went to have her nails painted, when the injuries were suffered at some point after 10am that day. Mr Lickley said: ‘Kiera was shaken violently, she may also have suffered further head impact. ‘Her injuries were so severe, having become unconscious and stopped breathing - she was in her father’s hands at the time - she suffered a heart attack. ‘She never recovered and was allowed to die the following day, the doctors unable to save her. ‘She hadn’t suffered those injuries as a result of choking or vomiting on her bottle as her father said but as a result of violent shaking by the adult holding her, her own father.’ He added that Conlin had inflicted the ‘terrible’ injuries ‘probably in anger’. Conlin shook his four-month-old daughter Kiera (above) so violently while left alone with her that she had a heart attack and stopped breathing. She also suffered skull fractures, rib fractures and bleeding to the brain . Kiera’s mother, Kelly-Marie Rayner, 26, (pictured left outside Winchester Crown Court) was earlier acquitted of a charge of causing or allowing the death of a child. Conlin (right) was told he will serve a minimum of 17 years . Mr Lickley said post mortem examinations showed that Kiera had suffered a rib fracture between four and eight weeks prior to her death with the same rib and another being fractured again about 14 days prior to her death along with three skull fractures. She suffered further rib fractures between three and five days prior to her death and showed signs of previously having suffered bleeding to the eyes. Mr Lickley said that there was ‘’stress and strain’ in the household and Rayner feared that Conlin might leave her. Other causes for the stress were money worries, with Conlin taking out short-term loans to shore up their bank account. Conlin, who worked as a debt collector, had also been experiencing trouble at work and had been facing disciplinary procedures after his performance had ‘dipped’. And his drug use also added to the strain on the household, Mr Lickley said. He added: ‘He is a drug user. He smoked cannabis on May 5, the day before events on May 6 and historically, at least, had taken cocaine.’ On the morning of May 6 2013, Conlin, dialled 999 to report his daughter was not breathing and was ‘limp’. Kiera (above)was taken to Southampton General Hospital on May 6 last year but she was pronounced brain dead and a life support machine was turned off the following day. She was four months old . On arrival, paramedics carried Kiera to a bedroom, placed her on the bed and fought to save her life. Conlin claimed at the time that he had tried to feed Kiera 10 minutes before and said he discovered she was not breathing after going to check on her, the five-week trial heard. Paramedics managed to revive the youngster and took her to Frimley Park Hospital in Surrey but her condition deteriorated and she was later transferred to Southampton General Hospital. However, she was pronounced brain dead and a life support machine keeping her alive was turned off the following day. Had she survived, the extent of her injuries would have also left her blind. Judge Mr Justice Royce said Kiera’s injuries were not caused accidentally as Conlin claimed. He said: ‘This is a sad and tragic case involving the killing of a little girl less than five months old. ‘After a time, she would not bond with you at all and she would start to cry if you even approached her. ‘It is clear to me that you became frustrated, you gripped and squeezed her by the chest so hard that you broke her ribs. ‘You must have known she was in pain as she would have screamed. ‘The skull fractures were caused by her head coming into contact with a hard object and she would have screamed in pain. Kelly Rayner (centre) attended Conlin's trial at Winchester Crown Court with her parents Paul and Dawn . ‘That morning, you caused what were catastrophic injuries which would in a matter of seconds cause her collapse and you knew what you had done. ‘The finger of suspicion also pointed momentarily at Ms Rayner, who was arrested and charged with causing or allowing Kiera’s death. ‘Her victim impact statement outlines the devastating effect that the death of Kiera has had on her and the rest of her family. Following Kiera’s death, her mother Kelly-Marie Rayner and grandfather Paul Rayner released the following poem paying tribute to her. ‘To our darling Kiera, your right to grow has been taken away . ‘You cannot mature, you can no longer play, this so cruelly denied in a barbaric way. ‘Our memories shared with our nation’s heart, may your story grow and help those in part. ‘You leave a mother, and grandparents, your family who loved you dearly, we will all miss you. ‘The police heard your voice, they continued to search, but they knew your killer, like you from the start. ‘Your body helped in a way you did not know, we thank you for that, we love you so. ‘Your dad hurt you, he has no regret, he closed your eyes, he stopped your breath. ‘He has now been judged, he deserves no rights, you are now free from pain, we now say goodnight.’ ‘They would have loved to see that little girl grow up and become closer to them. She was just a vulnerable child.’ Before being sentenced, Conlin told the court he had wanted to be more financially secure before having Kiera, adding: ‘The day Kiera died was the day everything fell apart.’ In mitigation, Elizabeth Marsh told . the court: ‘The fatal injuries were not caused with malice but with . frustration that he wanted to love her more but she wouldn’t let him. ‘It is a tragic case for all concerned - for Kelly, for Kiera’s grandparents and those who knew her.’ Today, bank advisor Ms Rayner wept and embraced her family in the public gallery as the judge handed out the life sentence to Conlin. The jury previously cleared her of causing or allowing the death of a child after it was deemed she could not possibly have known the extent of Kiera’s injuries and took steps to ensure her welfare with several visits to GPs. Following today’s sentencing, Detective Chief Inspector Scott Clarke of Hampshire Constabulary, said: ‘The trial into the death of baby Kiera Conlin has been a harrowing and difficult experience for all those involved. ‘We welcome this verdict and hope that Kiera’s extended family have now got answers to at least some of the many questions they had around her untimely death. ‘Kiera’s death was at the hands of a man whom she most relied and depended upon for love and the most basic care. She was abused and horrendously let down by this man - her father. ‘Without the abhorrent behaviour of her father, Kiera would still be alive today. ‘Investigations into this type of case are often extremely complex and difficult for officers, staff and the family of the deceased. ‘I would like thank the entire investigation team and the many medical professionals and specialists for all their hard work and dedication in bringing this case to an appropriate conclusion. ‘I would also like to personally thank Kiera’s extended family for their understanding and patience during what must have been one of the most challenging times of their lives.’","Ross Conlin shook four-month-old Kiera so violently she had a heart attack .

"By . Emma Glanfield . For centuries Cornwall has claimed the rights as the inventor of the traditional pasty. Marketed as a savoury snack which derived from the mining days, the county has long been associated with the humble pasty. But a historian has now threatened to upset the applecart by claiming to have found proof the traditional pasty was actually invented elsewhere - in the rivalling county of Devon. Marketed as a savoury snack which derived from the mining days, Cornwall has long been associated with the pasty. However, a historian has thrown a spanner in the works after claiming it actually came from Devon . Dr Todd Gray claims four lines of texts in records dating back to the 16th Century prove the ‘world’s first pasty recipe’ was born in Plymouth, Devon – fuelling an ongoing food war between the two counties which already clash over the correct way to make a cream tea. He claims to have made the discovery after scouring the historic Audit Book and Receivers Accounts in Plymouth for clues as to the origin of the food. He said one piece of text from records in 1509, refers to the financial cost of making a pasty and the recipe used - some 236 years before there was any record of pasties in Cornwall. Traditionalists claim the pasty was originally made as lunch for Cornish tin miners who were unable to return to the surface to eat. They were able to hold the pastry by the folded crust so the dirt didn’t touch the rest of their food, then discard that section afterwards. Devon pasties tend to have a crimped crust running along the top and are oval in shape while Cornish pasties are semi-circular with a thicker crust running along the curved edge of the pasty. The term 'Cornish pasty' was given protected status by the European Commission in 2011. It states that only pasties made in Cornwall from a traditional recipe can marketed as a 'Cornish pasty'. The Cornish Pasty Association applied for the special status, saying it wanted to protect the 'quality and reputation' of the pasty. The Protected Geographical Indication status means 'genuine' Cornish pasties are stamped with a special logo. The text, which says 'Itm for the cooke . is labor to make the pasties', is said to be proof the West Country snack . originated from Plymouth, which is separated from Cornwall by the River . Tamar. He said that while the intriguing text . suggests inventors were using venison from the Mount Edgcumbe estate . just across the Tamar Valley in Cornwall, it proves the pasty actually . originated in Devon. He said the first reference to pasties he . could find at the Cornwall Record Office was dated 1746 - more than two centuries after the records were logged in Plymouth. The findings have been published in a book - The Plymouth Book of Wonder – which features a collection of 100 ‘quirky and fascinating nuggets’ designed to attract visitors to the city. It has sparked a war of words between the two counties, which continue to dispute which way around cream and jam should be spread on the traditional cream tea. Jo Hartop, of the Cornish Pasty Association, said: ‘We produce the traditional Cornish pasty. ‘The historical books say that the pasty originated in Cornwall, but obviously there is lots of information out there. ‘If you talk to consumers, which is what matters the most - they say it originated in Cornwall.’ Dr Todd Gray claims to have found proof the traditional pasty was actually invented in Plymouth, Devon with records from the city, dating back to 1509 (above), apparently referring to the financial cost of making a pasty . Some Devonians claim the evidence is conclusive that the pasty - which makes Cornwall more than £60 million a year – originated in Plymouth. However, Nigel Eadie, owner of the Original Pasty House in Plymouth, conceded that pasties would always be more closely associated with Cornwall. He said: ‘Everyone would associate the origins of a pasty with Cornwall - it’s a Cornish pasty. ‘There are variations in terms of the styles that are made in Devon. ‘I don’t think it’s a big problem, it’s not really going to affect people’s decision about whether or not to buy a pasty. ‘It’s an interesting fact that will make the book even more fascinating if you’re living in Plymouth. ‘It’s a nice little feather in the cap of Plymothians to say that really the pasty actually originated in Plymouth.' The Cornish claim the jam should be spread first on the scone, while those in Devon claim cream should always come first . A battle has raged for years over the origins of the cream . tea, with both Devon and Cornwall claiming to be the real birthplace of the . tradition. And while the dispute continues to wager on, both counties remain . divided over the ‘right’ way to load up the quintessentially British afternoon . treat. In Devon, the scone is split into two and loaded with large . helpings of locally-sourced clotted cream before a dollop of jam is placed on . top. Meanwhile, the Cornish believe the proper way to serve a . scone is to first spread the jam before finishing it with a blob of clotted . cream. The age-old debate has rumbled on for years, with both . counties attempting to justify their method as correct. Some say the Cornish way helps the cream stay on without . sliding off, while Devonians defend their method by claiming it allows more . cream to be spread on the scone.","Historian claims records from 1509 prove pasty came from Plymouth, Devon .

"By . Catherine Hardy . With new statistics showing that men in London are being paid 13.2 per cent more than their female counterparts, it's not surprising that working women are feeling hard done by. In fact a huge 44 per cent of women believe their gender has hindered their careers, or will in the future, according to a new survey. And though Cameron’s latest parade of female cabinet members speaks of a change of attitudes towards women in traditionally “male” working environments, 12 per cent of women do not believe their employer values men and equally, no matter what their level. Fighting against the glass ceiling: Men in the City earn 13.2 per cent more than women (posed by models) A survey by Talking Talent, a consultancy firm working to inspire working women, hinted that workplace sexism is keeping women out of top roles, with 12 per cent of women saying they have been passed over for promotion because of their sex. For every pound men earned in 2013, women received . only 86.8p – down from 89.1p in 2012 – making it unsurprising that . over a third of women say they have experienced workplace prejudice. And across the UK, for every male pound the average earning for women is 80p, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics obtained by Labour. Experts believe the gap is due to men being awarded bigger bonuses - approximately £6,442 for men in management roles compared with £3,029 for women, according to the Fawcett Society - while women are relegated into part-time jobs with lower pay. Shadow women's minister Gloria De Piero told the Evening Standard 'Whether you’re a chief executive or hairdresser, women across the capital are being paid less than men for doing the same or equivalent work. Making it a priority: Shadow women's minister Gloria De Piero . 'There are some great examples of companies that are leading the way in efforts to close the gap but delivering equal pay should be a priority for all employers.' Though it’s not all bad news, with 80 per cent of women saying they feel their employer is supportive of them, there’s no denying that there’s a long way to go before there’s total gender equality in the workplace. Law, education and accountancy seem to be the career areas that women feel most supported in, with working mothers saying that employers in these industries are particularly supportive. Of these sectors accountancy tops the list as the best area for working women, receiving the highest scores for positive behaviour towards women by employers. On the flip side, working women have named the advertising, media, engineering and construction industries as the worst sectors to work in. For working mothers in particular, your career – like your children – can sometimes present a paradox, as the results of the survey show. With a third of employers  offering careers breaks for women to have a child, and 14 per cent offering subsidised childcare, just over seventy per cent of working mothers say their employer is supportive. But unfortunately, as the gender pay gap demonstrates, it’s not all rosy for women who want to have a career and children. Just get on with it! Dame Stephanie Shirley thinks women should stop complaining about the 'glass ceiling' A third of women have experienced workplace prejudice or discrimination because they were a mother, while 37 per cent said being a working mother has hindered their career, including being passed over for promotion. However, while the government continues to strive for equality in the workplace, some female business leaders say it’s time that women stopped moaning about the glass ceiling and just got on with it. Dame Stephanie Shirley, 80, who launched her own IT services company, Xansa, in 1962, says that women today don’t know how good they’ve got it. In her recent Daily Mail article she wrote ‘If only aggrieved women knew what I had to put up with just a generation before, they might moan less and, instead, focus on the giddy heights now firmly within their grasp. 'Believe me, women today would baulk at some of the blatant, institutionalised sexism that not only existed, but was actively encouraged [50 years ago].’","A huge 44% of women say their gender has hindered (or will) their career .

"By . Lydia Warren For Mailonline . Abby Hernandez, the teen who vanished for nine months before returning home in July, was violently abducted by a stranger before suffering 'numerous acts of unspeakable violence', her lawyer has said. Michael Coyne released a statement on Tuesday that shed some light on what happened to the now 15-year-old from Conway, New Hampshire after she was allegedly abducted by Nathaniel Kibby, 34, in October - but many questions still remain over exactly how she was kidnapped and returned home. 'As the justice system moves forward, . and the evidence is revealed, questions about this horrific event will . be answered,' read the statement, written on behalf of Abby and her mother Zenya. Scroll down for video . Safe: Abby Hernandez, pictured in court with her mother on July 29, suffered 'unspeakable violence' at the hands of her abductor after she vanished in October, her lawyer has said . 'Abby was violently abducted . by a stranger. For many months, she suffered numerous acts of . unspeakable violence. Through her faith, fortitude and resilience, she . is alive today and home with her family.' The statement was shared on the website, 'Bring Abby Home', which was created after Abby, then 14, vanished on October 9 as she left school. Nathaniel Kibby has been charged with her kidnapping and remains in jail, but mystery still surrounds exactly how Abby was abducted and what happened to her during her alleged captivity. She previously revealed that she often had access to the local paper, The Conway Daily Sun, and that it gave her hope because she realized people were still looking for her. Accused: Nathaniel Kibby, 34, is pictured in court on August 6. He has been charged with abducting Abby . Previous reports suggested Abby might have been confined in a shipping container kept behind Kibby's home in Gorham, and MailOnline revealed that . the container may have had three separate, sound-proofed rooms. One neighbor was even asked whether he thought Kibby could have dug a . tunnel from his trailer to the container. In court last week, prosecutors said the container did have three sections, with the . middle section being the largest. Defense attorney Jesse Friedman asked for the judge to block the . prosecution's attempt to remove the mobile home and a shipping . container, arguing that he needs to keep all . the evidence preserved because he has so little information on why his . client was arrested. Scene: Authorities are pictured investigating the area outside Kibby's home in July. There has been speculation that he kept her captive in this storage container, which was divided in to three rooms . Kibby is charged with a felony count of kidnapping, which carries a sentence of up to seven years in prison if he's convicted. He's being held on $1 million cash bail. The . family's statement on Tuesday thanked law enforcement and the media for helping to bring her . home, but added that the teenager now needs time to work through the . ordeal. 'Abby needs and wants some time and space . to physically and emotionally heal,' it read. 'It is going to be a long process . in pursuit of justice for Abby.' The following statement was posted on the 'Bring Abby Home' website on behalf of Abby and her mother. It was written by one of their lawyers, Michael Coyne. On behalf of Abigail Hernandez and her mother, Zenya Hernandez, we want to thank the New Hampshire State Police, the FBI, the Conway Police Department, all of the many law enforcement agencies that were involved in this effort, the community of Conway, the people of New England and everyone that cared about Abby’s abduction and prayed for Abby’s safe return as well as the media's efforts to bring attention to her kidnapping and assist with her miraculous survival. Abby needs and wants some time and space to physically and emotionally heal.  It is going to be a long process in pursuit of justice for Abby and for Abby to get physically and emotionally stronger.  We do not intend to have this case tried in the press. As the justice system moves forward, and the evidence is revealed, questions about this horrific event will be answered. Abby was violently abducted by a stranger.  For many months, she suffered numerous acts of unspeakable violence.  Through her faith, fortitude and resilience, she is alive today and home with her family. Abby simply asks that you respect her wishes and the justice process as this case moves forward. We trust that justice will be done.  On behalf of Abby, we ask that you be sensitive to the well-being of this child and give her the time and space she needs—that any of us would desire for a member of our own family or loved one who suffered as she has. Abigail and Zenya Hernandez are represented by Michael L. Coyne of Andover, Massachusetts and Steven Hyde and Briana Coakley of Coakley and Hyde in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.","Lawyers for the New Hampshire teen released a statement on behalf of her family on Tuesday, calling her abduction 'horrific'

"By . Catherine Hardy . In a family that definitely lucked-out in the beauty genes department, one generation has followed the next as Georgia May Jagger’s first advert promoting Thierry Mugler’s iconic fragrance Angel was released today – 19 years after her mother Jerry Hall was the face of the scent. Revealing the images for the advert on her Instagram, the young model said: ‘So honoured to be the new face of Angel fragrance by #ThierryMugler 19 years after my mother’. Jerry, then aged 38, was the face for the perfume back in 1995 to 1997, in a particularly sultry advert which saw the leggy blonde reclining on a moonlit sand dune. Beware of angels: The gap-toothed beauty looks sultry and mysterious in the new advert for the iconic fragrance . Following in not only her mother’s footsteps, but also those of Eva Mendes and Naomi Watts, the campaign shows 22-year Jagger, known for her Rimmel ads and gap-toothed smile, in an edgier campaign, with the tagline ‘Beware of angels’ 'It was a very creative ad. At one point, I was painted blue and covered in sparkles,'she told Vogue. 'It was incredible to go through the Mugler archives and see so many incredible dresses. It was quite inspiring to see it all.""' Jagger, who is one of the crowd of young models of the moment including Cara Delevingne and Jourdan Dunn, and has recently appeared in the Just Cavalli perfume campaign, said that being the face of Angel is a very special role for her. ‘My mother was a muse of Mugler and appeared regularly in his Paris runway shows. I have such wonderful memories of the fragrance and my mother's involvement with the Mugler brand. ‘It's very special to me to be following in my mother's footsteps.’ Fallen from heaven: Jerry Hall, described as Mugler's muse, in the 1995 Angel advert .

"By . Wills Robinson for MailOnline . Influx: Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe says police are preparing for extremists who could return if they start losing in Iraq and Syria . Hundreds of British extremists could return to the UK if jihadist groups start losing battles in Iraq and Syria, the country’s most senior police officer has warned. Scotland Yard chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said it cannot be predicted when potential terrorists might decide to return home, but police are preparing in case of an influx. It is estimated that around 500 Britons have travelled to Syria to fight alongside extremists, half of whom are thought to be from London. Sir Bernard said there are 'a significant number of people who run the risk of being radicalised, militarised and potentially desensitised to violence, who one day we assume will come home'. He added: 'The biggest concern certainly I have is that none of us know which way those wars are going to go. We’ve seen some quite radical movements across whole countries. Look at Iraq, the shift in a few days. These world events were moving at pace. 'That was obviously Islamists who were progressing positively. If there were to be a reverse of that at pace, and they were to lose, there is a risk that hundreds of people would want to come home. That’s the biggest challenge. 'We can’t predict when it might happen. Should there be large numbers returning it puts great pressure on all of us to make sure that we are kept safe. 'While they are there they are not an immediate threat, but should they come back, and should they come back together, that’s a concern. We are trying our best to prepare for that. No one should underestimate the task. Yesterday a photograph emerged showing British rapper Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, 23, holding a decapitated head of a Syrian soldier while standing in Raqqa's central square - the capital of ISIS' self-declared caliphate. He uploaded the image to Twitter alongside the post: 'Chillin' with my homie or what's left of him.' It was also revealed earlier this week  that a former supervisor at Primark who travelled to Syria to join the extremists was killed. Muhammad Hamidur Rahman, 25, was one of 10 Britons from Portsmouth – all of Bangladeshi origin – who went to Syria to join the Islamic State. Scroll down for video . Militants: Earlier this week it was revealed that Muhammad Hamidur Rahman, 25, from Portsmouth died in fighting. He fought with Mashudur Choudhury, the first British man to be convicted of terrorist activity in Syria . Rahman flew to Turkey with five other friends, and then crossed the border by land into Syria. In May, Mashudur Choudhury, 31, who accompanied Rahman, but returned to the UK, became the first person in the UK to be convicted of taking part in terrorist activity in Syria. Concerns about homegrown involvement in terrorism increased after three young Britons appeared in a propaganda video for the insurgent group. Among them was aspiring jihadi Aseel Muthana, who told the BBC he was fighting in Syria and had no intention of returning to the UK. His brother Nasser appeared with two other British men - 20-year-old Reyaad Khan, from Cardiff, and Abdul Raqib Amin, who grew up in Aberdeen. In April, the Metropolitan Police issued a plea for people to come forward with information about their family members if they were concerned about them joining terrorist training camps in Syria. British jihadist: Reyaad Khan, 20, a former student from Cardiff, has boasted of preparing for 'martyrdom'.

"By . Wills Robinson for MailOnline . Controversial: Almost 60,000 people have urged Sheffield United not to re-sign rapist footballer Ched Evans following his release . Almost 60,000 people have signed a petition urging Sheffield United not to re-sign rapist footballer Ched Evans when he is released from prison. The 25-year-old, who is serving a five-year sentence for rape, is said to have already held talks with the club and is expected to complete a £3million deal after his full release in October. The Welsh striker was jailed in April 2012 for raping a 19-year-old woman in a hotel room in Rhyl, North Wales. After reports circulated that Sheffield United were planning a return for the disgraced player, an online petition was set up and opponents quickly condemned the proposal. An extract on the site reads: 'For the male leaders of the club to endorse him and ""welcome him back"" is an absolute humiliation to all women who expect the men who commit gross acts of violence against women to pay for what they have done and part of that is relinquishing the celebrity they attained.' Campaigners also believe his reinstatement would send the wrong message and could be damaging to the club's reputation. Director of communications at Rape Crisis England and Wales, Katie Russell, said: 'It is of course any convicted criminal's right to serve their sentence and then go back into employment. We absolutely stand by that. 'But at the same time we would urge Sheffield United to think very carefully about the message that they send when they immediately re-employ someone who's been convicted of such a very serious crime. 'If they choose to do that, which is their right, we urge them to seriously consider the impact that will have on huge numbers of their supporters and we urge them to make a very strong statement condemning sexual violence, condemning violence against women and girls and making it clear that misogyny, sexism, violence and sexual violence in particular won't be tolerated within football.' She added that if he returns, the convicted rapist will soon be celebrated as a 'talented footballer and goal-scorer'. 'There will be survivors of sexual violence - both male and female - in the crowd if he returns to the pitch. The club need to take some sort of corporate responsibility to show that they do condemn sexual violence,' she added. Alan Smith, a member of Sheffield United's Supporters Club executive, told Mail Online that someone 'very high up' at the club has assured him Evans will return to the club. 'At the end of the day he has been convicted and has served his time. I do not condone rapists at all, but I want Ched Evans to come back,' he said. Sentence: The footballer was jailed in 2012 for raping a 19-year-old woman in a hotel room and is expected to be released in October . Anger: The petition, addressed to club chairman Kevin McCabe, has attracted strong comments from opponents with some suggesting it would be a 'humiliation' to see him back on the pitch . 'He will get a lot of stick from the away fans when he returns, but the home fans will leave him alone because they want him back. 'I believe that if he was at another club, he would be allowed to play.' It is understood that officials from the club, including manager Nigel Clough, have visited him in during his sentence at HM Wymott in Lancashire and have already discussed his future at the League One side. Evans was found guilty at Caernarfon Crown Court of raping a woman in a hotel room in Rhyl, North Wales, in April 2012. One of his appeals has already been overturned, but his legal team has now referred his case to the independent Criminal Cases Review Commission in another effort to clear his name. Former Port Vale and Walsall defender Clayton McDonald, also admitted having sex with the same woman but was cleared of rape charges. A spokesman for the club said they had nothing to add and are yet to confirm Evans's future at the club.","The 25-year-old is serving a five-year prison sentence for rape .

"By . Jaymi Mccann . A pensioner dubbed 'supergran' caught a fleeing shoplifter by battering him with her handbag. Margaret Leese, 77, leapt into action after spotting thief Andrew Reece, 26, running from a shop with four bottles of alcohol on February 13. Seconds after leaving the Co-op in Bucknall, Stoke-on-Trent, Margaret whacked Reece with her handbag. Hero pensioner Margaret Leese was praised by police for helping to stop a robbery at a Co-op store, in Bucknall, Staffordshire. The retired canteen cook, who has 12 grand-children and 13 great-grandchildren,caught Reece on the right shoulder . He then barged Margaret over but was arrested by officers who were nearby when he fell over the pensioner. Margaret, who suffered a fractured left wrist and ligament damage in the incident, was hailed a hero by police after Reece was jailed for 20 weeks for assault and theft. Speaking from her home in Abbey Hulton, Staffordshire, Margaret, who cares full-time for her terminally ill husband Stan, 80, said: 'I knew he was a bad one who needed to be stopped. 'I didn't really think about anything else other than stopping him. He looked quite surprised when I clobbered him with my bag. 'I'm not awfully big but I could see he was running away so did what I could. I just swung my bag and it hit him as he ran into me. 'Me and Stan normally get a taxi together everywhere we go, but there was snow on the ground so I told Stan to stay in and I would catch the bus to the doctors. Margaret said she acted on instinct when she stopped Reece, who has been jailed for 20 weeks after the robbery . 'On the way back, I was a bit early so decided to nip for a loaf. When I got to the shop I saw two police officers who looked like they were waiting for someone. 'Then I saw a young man coming towards me and I knew instantly it was him they wanted.' Reece then assaulted the the pensioner as he attempted his escape. She added: 'He pushed me and I went flat on my back. He gave me quite a bash. He tried to get away but he tripped over me and fell on his face. 'I was black and blue. I had to have my arm put in a cast, it is still painful now. 'He was stronger than I thought he was going to be and I am just lucky I was wearing my duffel coat so I didn't hurt my head. I don't know why I did it, it was just instinct. 'Everyone has been really supportive. The police have been wonderful.' Reece was arrested at the scene and jailed at North Staffordshire Justice Centre earlier this week. Staffordshire Police yesterday praised Mrs Leese for her actions. Chief Superintendent Bernie O'Reilly, left, said: 'Mrs Leese is a wonder woman. She was brave and courageous and I really can't thank her enough for helping my officers arrest this lad. 'She helped to grab hold of him and we are really grateful for that.

"By . Hannah Roberts In Rome . Two ultra right wing football hooligans have been jailed for a savage assault on a group of English football fans in Rome last year. The severe beating by a mob in a central Rome pub last November left 13 Tottenham Hotspur supporters injured and one fighting for his life in hospital. Ashley Mills, a builder from Brentwood in Essex was almost killed after being stabbed in the femoral artery in his groin. Scene of the crime: The Drunken Ship pub in Rome . Thugs wearing masks and crash helmets blocked the entrance to the pub and threw tear gas and smoke bombs to disorientate their victims before attacking them .

"By . Hannah Roberts In Rome . Former German SS officer Erich Priebke will be buried in 'a secret location' The Nazi war criminal, whose body has lain in limbo since he died two weeks ago, has avoided ‘a Bin Laden-style burial’, after a deal to inter his corpse in a secret location was struck, his lawyer has claimed. The coffin of Erich Priebke has been parked at a military airport in Rome for days since violent protests disrupted his funeral. His family and friends had refused entreaties to have him cremated and buried at sea like Osama bin Laden. Former SS captain Priebke was serving a life sentence for the 1944 massacre of the Ardeatine Caves. The slaughter outside Rome of 335 men and boys was a reprisal for an attack on Nazi police by resistance fighters. It is considered the worst atrocity of the Second World War in Italy. Since Priebke’s death, an intense legal battle has raged over his burial place. It is feared that any grave could become a pilgrimage site for his neo-Nazi followers. The Vatican banned any rites for taking place in Rome and the Prefect of Rome forbade his burial anywhere in the province. His birth town of Henningsdorf in Germany said they could not accommodate him, and even Argentina, his adopted homeland refused to take back his body, saying it ‘would be an affront to humanity’. But a solution has now been found, according to Priebke’s lawyer. In a cryptic statement to Italian news agency ANSA, Paolo Giachini said: 'Everything is solved.' Claiming victory ‘after a week of oppression’ he said:  'An agreement has been reached with the authorities for the burial of Erich Priebke in a secret place, between Germany and Italy, or in one of the two nations.’ Protestors surround the car which was carrying the body of Erich Priebke at the church of Lefebvriani, Italy earlier this week . The war criminal's coffin was being held at the The Pratica di Mare military airport, near Rome . He continued: 'The Jewish community wanted him to end up like Bin Laden, with the ashes scattered at sea, so as not to create a place of pilgrimage. ‘Instead we will be able to pay tribute to a figure who became symbol of dignity, freedom and human endurance.' Neither the authorities nor the Jewish community have succeeded in defeating us, he said. 'The Priebke family has got what it deserved, the rights to religious practice and burial that are guaranteed,' Even in death Priebke has continued to cause pain to the relatives of his victims. In a tape released posthumously but recorded before he died, Priebke showed no remorse, instead blamed the resistance fighters, for provoking the attack. In this video released after his death Erich Priebke blamed resistance fighters for provoking the attack in which he was involved . Priebke was extradited from Argentina to Italy in 1995 to face sentencing for his atrocities in the war . The partisans were fully aware of the consequences, he said. 'The commander when he arrived in Rome had put on the wall warnings that any attack against Germans would meet with a reprisal. 'They knew that and they did it anyway.’ It would have been unthinkable to refuse the direct order from the Fuhrer, Priebke claimed. Priebke was serving a life sentence under house arrest for his role in the murder of 335 men and boys in the 1944 massacre of the Ardeatine Caves . ‘Naturally it was impossible to refuse. 'Schultz said it was an order from Hitler and we had to carry it out. He said if anyone didn’t want to do it they may as well line up with those who were to be executed. 'There was no other way.’ Priebke started his career as a teenage waiter working all over Europe including the Italian Riviera and a happy stint between 1933 and 1935 at the Savoy in London. He later told friends of the exhilaration of watching the Silver Jubilee celebrations for George V. He joined the Gestapo as a translator where he was swiftly promoted and posted to Rome. At the end of the war he was captured by Allied troops but escaped from a British POW camp on New Year’s Eve 1947. The Gestapo officer fled to Argentina where he ran a delicatessen and lived openly until tracked down and interviewed by an American journalist. In 1995 he was deported to Italy and given a life sentence. Because of his age he was allowed to serve his time under house arrest at the home of his lawyer.","Erich Priebke's body will not be cremated and buried at sea like Osama Bin Laden .

"By . Hannah Roberts In Rome . He has refused all entreaties to don Vatican finery, preferring to stick with his simple white cassock and iron cross.

An enthusiastic pilgrim had thrown the rosary beads at Francis, as he circled the crowds in his Popemobile at the end of a mass in Rome’s St Peter’s square. The Pope’s security riding alongside him were seemingly oblivious to the arrival of the unexpected present. Francis looked momentarily startled as he felt something hanging next to his cheek. But when he saw the beads, he chuckled before putting them in his pocket. Last June he had caught a rosary thrown by the faithful to the amusement of the crowd who applauded. Today's Marian Day mass, was attended by a 100,000 crowd, said Vatican Radio. Since his inauguration Francis has ditched much of the finery in which his predecessors bedecked themselves .

"By . Hannah Roberts In Rome . and Sophie Jane Evans . Amanda Knox was not a sex goddess, but ‘shy and bumbling’ in bed, her ex-boyfriend Rafaelle Sollecito has claimed. Rather than taking part in deviant sex games, the 26-year-old relished having her hair combed, her one-time lover has revealed. The disclosing comments come as Sollecito, 29, and Knox, who spent four years in prison for the 2007 murder of British student Meredith Kercher in Perugia, prepare to stand retrial at the end of this month. Former flames: Raffaele Sollecito, right, the ex-boyfriend of Amanda Knox, left, has rubbished the idea that she is a sexually deviant enchantress who instigated the murder of British exchange student Meredith Kercher as part of an erotic game . The pair were convicted of the brutal killing of the Leeds University student in 2009, but freed in 2011 on appeal. Miss Mercher was found with her throat slashed in the bedroom of the house in Perugia in central Italy that she shared with American Miss Knox in November 2007. However, earlier this year, Italy’s highest court sensationally overturned the appeal verdict and ordered Knox and Sollecito to stand trial again. In court, Knox was painted as a sexually deviant enchantress who instigated the murder as part of an erotic game. But her former lover has rubbished the idea of a sex game as ‘ridiculous’. Victim: Miss Kercher was found lying in a pool of blood with her throat cut in the Perugia house she shared with Knox in 2007. In December 2009, Knox and Sollecito were found guilty of her murder, but after an 11-month appeal both convictions were overturned in October 2011 . Discovery: This picture shows the flat where the bloodied body of Miss Kercher was found in 2007 . 'She wasn’t remotely deviant,' he told Italian weekly magazine Oggi. ‘Amanda was shy, inexpert and a little ham-handed: like me in fact. ‘I don’t want to go into details, it wouldn’t be right . But I will tell you, for example, that many times more than anything else she just wanted me to comb her hair.’ After their successful appeal, Knox returned to her hometown of Seattle where she is studying creative writing. She has said that she will not return to Italy for the retrial, although if she is found guilty, Italy is expected to start extradition proceedings. Close: Knox and Sollecito can be . seen kissing in Italy shortly after being named as suspects in . the murder of Miss Kercher . Sollecito, who is close to graduating in Robotic Surgery from the University of Verona, has said he will be at the new appeal trial to defend himself. Earlier this year, he moved briefly to Lugarno in Switzerland in the hope of starting a foundation that investigates unsolved crimes. But within only a few months, his residence permit was revoked when authorities discovered his pending legal battles. If the trial ends favourably, Sollecito said he plans to move to California. ‘As a computer programmer Silicon Valley is like Mecca for me,' he told Oggi. ‘But I’m on standby. I see that everything else moves but I feel like I’m frozen. By annulling our absolution, the Supreme Court has put me back in a prison.' Knox is pictured arriving at her appeal trial in Perugia, Italy, on October 3, 2011. After the conviction was overturned, Knox and Sollecito were immediately released from prison and Knox flew back to America and signed a lucrative book contract . Knox leaves the courtroom after her appeal trial session in Perugia . Relief: Amanda Knox cries following the verdict that overturned her conviction of murdering Miss Kercher . He added that he has been in love 'only once' since Amanda and is now single as he struggles to make relationships work. 'It didn’t last, said Sollecito. 'They all end badly, partly my own fault. If you don’t have a life, how can you share it with someone?' A recent Facebook appeal for financial aid has raised 20,000 dollars, but much more is needed even to pay off Sollecito's legal debts. His family has spent more than a million euros on lawyers since the beginning, he estimated. The retrial in Florence starts at the end of this month.

"By . Harriet Hernando For Mailonline . A cheeky mink fancied some fast food – so it dived into a fisherman’s bucket and made off with his catch. The mink was caught on camera plundering the bucket and carrying away the live catfish – which is bigger and heavier than him. ‘Oh my god he’s got it, wait, it’s too heavy,’ said one onlooker watching the fight between fish and mink. The mink scrambles out of the bucket and onto the concrete as if to reassess the situation, taking a running jump and diving back into the bucket for a second round with the fish. It takes the furry beast three attempts to hoist the fish out of the bucket and onto dry land, where it lies flapping its tail helplessly. The mink then drags the fish away and into a hole in some nearby rocks on a pier on Lake Ontario in Webster, New York.

"By . Hannah Roberts In Rome . Never mind a place in the sun, if you’ve ever dreamed of owning your very own Italian castle, or an island in the Venetian lagoon, now’s the time. As the cash-strapped Italian government attempts to tackle its deficit, the state is to sell off some of the family silver. A haunted fortress and a cardinal’s trophy palace are among 50 historic properties for sale. The Island of San Giacomo is currently in ruins after being abandoned by the army but the Italian government hopes a developer will see its potential as a luxury resort, and is hoping to find buyers for another 49 properties . The move recalls 2012, when Greece was forced to sell off some its beautiful islands to foreign buyers, to chip away at its enormous debts. The Italian government hope that the nation's treasures will be bought by private businesses and converted into hotels, restaurants and museums, bringing much needed employment and international investment. The sale of the 50 properties will raise £424.8million, Minister for the Economy Fabrizio Saccomanni said. The sale was approved as part of an emergency decree aimed at keeping Italy’s 2013 budget deficit within 3 % to avoid corrective action by Brussels. Orsini Castle, near Viterbo, was built for Pope Francis III and can be yours for £12.7million . The medieval fortress sits above the feudal town of Soriano Nel Cimino . The former prison is said to be haunted and currently serves as an art gallery . Prime minister Enrico Letta is planning to accompany the sales with further austerity measures worth £934million. Another £1.27billion is to come from a second tranche of properties to be sold later on. The idea was first mooted last year by Mario Monti, the technocrat who took over as Prime Minister in December 2011, when Silvio Berlusconi took public debt to unsustainable levels. The ‘Kill Public Debt’ plan originally listed 350 properties but officials now deem that some assets, such as military airbases, are poorly suited for the commercial market. The properties are to be marketed through a state-run fund who will advance the money to the Treasury, selling off the assets as buyers are found, the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera reported. The properties include Orsini Castle, which sits above its own feudal village near Viterbo, about 60miles from Rome. The medieval fort was built for Pope Nicholas III in the 1270s and has a £12.7million price tag. Said to be haunted, it was used as a prison from the mid-19th century to 1989 and has since been an art gallery. In Venice the properties on offer include the Island of San Giacomo in Palude, north-east of Murano. Villa Mirabello features artistic frescoes and is set in parkland close to the highly-desirable Monza, near Milan . The island was inhabited by monks and friars from the 11th century before it became a military base in the 1800s. Since it was abandoned in 1961, it has fallen into ruin but could appeal to international investors as a luxury resort. Other national treasures to go under the hammer include the 18th century palace, Villa Mirabello. The frescoed villa, set in parkland near Monza, close to Milan, was built in the 18th century by Cardinal Durini, the Inquisitor of Malta. Property expert Rupert Fawcett head of Knight Frank Italy said the scheme made ‘logical business sense.’ He said: ‘The reality is that any government in Europe is looking to raise funds where they can. The cost of running these properties can be huge and the sheer upkeep of them can be unmanageable. ‘If properties can be bought by private investors, restored to their former glory it’s good for everyone. It benefits local communities and puts some money in the state coffers.’ Head of the Italian employers federation Confindustria, Giorgio Squinzi, said to cut the deficit Italy’s needed ‘drastic action'. ‘Continuing with the status quo our country will remain, at zero or low growth,' he said. It is not the first time Italy has sold off assets. Last year a succession of lighthouses on the island of Sardinia were sold off to private businesses and converted into hotels, galleries, and museums. The island’s autonomous government could no longer afford the cost of maintaining and restoring them.","The £12.7million castle was built for Pope Francis III .

Truckers who have watched the video say the man's skill, the western Kansas sand grabbing the rig's tires and perhaps pure luck helped save the day. The drama was captured by a driver who was traveling right behind the rig. Jeff Steinberg, owner and instructor at APEX CDL Institute, told Fox Carolina the driver of the semi did an outstanding job in keeping the rig from rolling over. 'That driver deserves a medal,' Steinberg said. 'That was a great driving maneuver there.' Saving the day: The driver rescues the rig by turning into the tilt and . 'He did the only thing you could do, which was a perfect reaction to turn in the wind,' Steinberg said. 'There's no way to actually teach that.'

Walmart is the nation's favorite place to shop with more than 4,570 locations, in 2012 the supermarket chain brought in nearly $329 billion in retail sales. The Golden Arches of McDonald's came in at number two on the list compiled by Placed, a consumer habits data service provider that monitors American consumer activity. The place to go: Americans' favorite place to go of all is Walmart. They have increased their store count to 4,570 locations in 2012, and spent $1.8 billion on advertising that same year . Top of the food chain: McDonald's was by far the most visited fast-food restaurant in the nation in March. Although McDonald's remains hugely popular . According to the report, half off the retailers Americans are visiting these days are fast-food restaurants or stores that are chains throughout the country. The reason for these being the most popular stores, as explained by Placed founder and CEO David Shim, is logical. The information was analyzed and compiled by the financial news website Wall St. 24/7. A person doesn’t need household supplies every day, but people need eat three or more times per day. Naturally, he says, there is a higher propensity for the masses to visit the food businesses more often. In at 3: Among restaurants, Subway trails only McDonald's in popularity.

"By . Joel Christie . and James Gordon . From the surgeon hoping it will help train a new generation of doctors, to the Iron Man triathlete saying it allows him to go faster, Google Glass users of all kinds came together on Saturday night to discuss both the future and the bothers with the first stages of the controversial 'wearable technology'. 'Glass Night Out' events were held in eight cities across America - Boston, Los Angeles, Madison, Milwaukee, New York, Orlando, Palo Alto and Washington, D.C. - to encourage dialogue among 'explorers' -  the techies who subscribed to the $1500 test version of the eyewear, known as the 'explorer edition'. The 'explorers' are Google's guinea pigs as they continue to work on the software to make Glass more readily available to the public - with early complaints the batteries are only lasting 30 minutes - while most of the explorers are themselves developers planning to create their own concepts to introduce via Google Glass as the concept moves forward, such as creating iPhone-like applications. For explorers like Allen Firstenberg, 43, of Poughkeepsie, who attended a Glass event in New York's East Village, the initial technology Google implemented has already changed his day-to-day life. Scroll down for video... The Explorers: Subscribers to the Google Glass 'explorer edition' - the first ready-to-wear design of the device - come together to discuss the eyewear at Solas in New York's East Village on Saturday May 3, 2014 . Everyday users: Allen Firstenberg (right) says that Google Glass has allowed him to take photos and send texts without lifting a finger, while cyclist Adam Kushner (said) uses it to improve his performance in triathlons . Test run: MailOnline reporter Joel Christie takes a look at Google Glass as part of New York's 'Glass Night Out' on Saturday May 3 . 'I never used to send texts before, . because I found it so laborious to do on a phone, but with Glass I send . texts all the time, because it's so easy,' he told The Mail Online. 'I just say who I'm sending it . to and what I want it to say, and as soon I stop talking, Glass knows to send. 'Just like smartphones did, Glass has allowed for a whole new way of thinking about computers. 'We call PC's the personal computer, well this is the new PC. 'There's something very convenient and natural seeing your emails and alerts popping up in front of you, rather than having to get out your phone and flip.' Adam Kushner, 33, who also works in IT, is an ultra-distance qualifier for Iron Man triathlons, and uses his Glass while in cycle training to measure the amount of energy he is using in his rear tyre. Furthermore, the tiny operating screen in the right lens has helped with his lazy eye. 'I've had problems with my right eye for a while and my left is much stronger, but Glass has, strangely, helped it,' Kushner said. General surgeon Jonny Reall, 39, is in the process of developing a way to use Glass as a teacher tool for medical students in the operating room. 'I can't give too much of it away, because obviously I'm working on this, but it's about being able to visualize what you're doing on a table while having an aid in the Glass, that you're able to look at while you're in surgery,' he said. Graphic designer Parker Boeb, 28, from New York, said while he uses Glass mostly for personal use, he has started sending photos of projects to his clients. 'But mostly I use it to take pictures, and I take a lot of pictures with it, which I use for inspiration at work,' he said. Klaus Bandisch, 59, a freelance web developer who has previously worked for Apple and Google, said people have accused him of filming them when he isn't. 'Ofcourse I'm not, but this is New York - show me somewhere you're not being filmed,' he said. Upon the release of the second-generation Glass, those already enrolled in the Google Explorer program - about 6,000 people - will able to 'invite' three of their friends to join the scheme. Google are rumored to be working on facial recognition, a zoom-in camera and live internet streaming for the sophomore edition. Google is hoping its Explorer faithful will help 'dispel Glass myths to all' Google . recently revealed the first official etiquette guide for its Glass . wearable computer - and admits users have been seen as 'creepy and rude' for wearing the device. The . firm warns users to ask people's permission before recording them, and . warns against 'glassing out' where they focus on the screen too much. The . guide comes as Google is expanding the number of people who have the . $1500 prototypes, ahead of an expected release later this year. 'With new technology comes new questions, and our Explorers help to answer those questions,' Google said. 'Since the program started, our Explorers have gotten a lot of attention when they wear Glass out and about. 'Reactions . range from the curious – 'Wow! Are those the ‘Google glasses’? How do . they work?” – to the suspect – 'Goodness gracious do those things see . into my soul?!' Reaction to the new design has been mixed, with some critics saying changes to the device looked bulky. Google . has come under fire for the unfashionable look of Glass, although has . developed its own frames for the system which allow prescription lenses, . and partnered with Ray-Ban to develop fashionable frames. The 'Glass Night Out' is part of a continued effort to reduce the polarizing effect of the glass headsets, which let users snap photos, shoot video, perform a search and do lots of other smartphone-like tasks in front of their eyes. The idea of a computer and recording device on one's head has made some non-Glass users uncomfortable, and it has pushed the conversation about etiquette and social norms in a connected world. Establishments including bars and movie theaters have kicked out Explorers (whom critics call 'Glassholes'). In February, Google released an etiquette guide explaining how users can avoid being labeled a 'Glasshole' when strutting around with the headware. The company followed up with a post in March about the ""top 10 myths"" about Glass, which include the idea that Glass is always recording. Ready for the mainstream?

Gary Police Chief Wade Ingram said an officer found Castro with a handgun in the garage of the house and ordered him to drop the weapon, but Castro shot himself. 'The Gary officer made contact with Mr. Castro. After disobeying the officer's command, Mr. Castro turned the gun on himself and administered a fatal self-inflicted wound,' said Chief Greg Mance, Griffith Police Department. The Rev. Theodore Mens, pastor of St. Mary's, said Castro's son helped with the after-school religious program and that the daughter, who used to attend the school, is now a sophomore at Bishop Noll Institute in Hammond. Fled: Remanard Castro, 55, fled the scene in a motorcycle and went to his home in Gary, Indiana before shooting himself in the head when cops arrived . Nina Castro worked at St. Catherine's Hospital in East Chicago, Mens said. The pastor said St. Mary's School wasn't in session Monday because of the Easter holiday but that after-school programs were being held. 'This tragedy indicates that all of us, individually and as a society, have to make better decisions than we do in general,' Mens said. The couple was divorcing, with a final hearing scheduled for June 10, according to Lake County court records. Remanard Castro, who was accused of sexually assaulting his wife at his home in November, was charged in February with rape and criminal confinement. Witnesses: Nina Castro was picking up her 14-year-old son from an after-school program after having picked up her 16-year-old daughter from another schoolThe two children witnessed the shooting, . His wife went to the Gary house to retrieve some belongings, and Castro pointed a handgun at her forehead and forced her to have sex with him, then threatened to beat her with a crowbar, according to prosecutors. Remanard In the allegations filed in February added the divorce wasn’t 'going to be pretty' and that 'the kids were going to suffer,' the probable cause affidavit states. Police said the fatal shooting Monday appears to have stemmed from a domestic dispute.

"By . James Gordon . As if alcohol wasn't already easy enough to come by, the U.S. Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau has reportedly approved a new product called Palcohol, an alcoholic powder that comes in flavors including Cosmopolitan and Kamikaze. Curiously, Palcohol's current website is light on details but the urge to 'drink responsibly' does not appear to be among the company's top priorities. 'Maybe you’re a college football fan. So many stadiums don’t even serve alcohol. What’s that about; watching football without drinking?! That’s almost criminal. Bring Palcohol in and enjoy the game.' Get drunk fast: Powdered alcohol comes in seven different varieties and will be on sale by the fall . Palcohol...because liquid alcohol isn't always convenient. Since Palcohol is a powder, it makes it easy to enjoy a cocktail just about anywhere . Perhaps even more bizarrely, as well as adding the alcoholic power to water, the site also suggests that Palcohol can also be poured over food. 'Sprinkle Palcohol on almost any dish and give it an extra kick. Some of our favorites are the Kamikaze in guacamole, Rum on a BBQ sandwich, Cosmo on a salad and Vodka on eggs in the morning to start your day off right.' There are even some rudimentary cooking instructions: 'Remember, you have to add Palcohol AFTER a dish is cooked as the alcohol will burn off if you cook with it... and that defeats the whole purpose.' The TTB has approved seven versions of this powdered alcohol within the past few days. The alcohol content is around the 60% range and the power can even be snorted. The company wrote on its site: 'You’ll get drunk almost instantly because the alcohol will be absorbed so quickly in your nose.' Party on! The company had stated that Palcohol would make it easier to consume alcohol where it is normally banned, such as at ball games . Palcohol will come in seven different flavors and it simply needs to be added to water in order for the boozing to begin. A number of bloggers are treating the announcement with a healthy degree of skepticism. 'The person that pushed this through must be very patient or lucky and/or good. The product seems highly likely to raise a large number of legal issues and controversies,' writes Patent lawyer Daniel Christopherson on Bevlaw.com. Patent applications are kept confidential by the government until they either issue as a patent or are published. Palcohol describes its product as 'Patent Pending,' which means that they have recently filed a patent application. Start the day of right! Sprinkle a Kamikaze on your breakfast cereal . Perhaps recognising that such a marketing strategy risked causing controversy, and even possible legal issues, Palcohol has recently removed the original copy from its website and issued a clarification: . 'We were caught off guard with the release of some of our labels by the TTB. As a result, people visited this website that we thought was under the radar because we had not made a formal announcement of Palcohol. 'Clearly, this site isn't finished. Thus, the verbiage that was copied was still in draft mode and the labels that were up were incorrect. So please disregard what is being printed as a result of information taken from this site. 'What we can say now is that we hope the product will be used in a responsible and legal manner. Being in compliance with all Federal and State laws is very important to us. Palcohol will only be sold through establishments that are licensed to sell liquor.' Powdered alcohol is not a new concept. Such products are already being sold in other countries including Japan, Germany, and the Netherlands. According to some, alcohol laws would in general only apply to liquids. This would mean that powder-based alcoholic beverages could be sold to minors and that the powder would be exempt from alcohol tax and laws, as is the case with certain products in the Netherlands.","Palcohol can easily be sneaked into sporting events .
The powdered alcohol can also be used in drinks or sprinkled on food .

'Our pregnancies basically mirrored each others’, said Andrea. 'We had the same kind of morning sickness and the same aches and pains. So I had someone to call who literally knew how I was feeling right then.' Their doctor Dr. Christina Litherland even offered to induce them on the same day but the twins each decided they would give birth on different days so they could be there for each others' delivery. With their first sons, the sisters had been in the delivery room with each other.

However, before the scheduled inductions could happen, Andrea went into labor early Saturday morning. Sister Jessica had planned to follow her sister to the hospital a short time later to attend the delivery, but then her own water broke and she began having contractions. 'My water broke. Before I knew it, I was headed in to have my son, too.' With both sisters in labor, Dr. Litherland ended up running run back and forth between the labor rooms to deliver the baby boys. 'It was just amazing,' she said. Andrea welcomed her son Hampton first, followed by Jessica’s son, Dawson, four hours later. 'I actually wheeled down there so I could be in the room with Jessica,' said Andrea. 'How often do you get that chance?'

"By . Damien Gayle . A piece of seat leather stained with the blood of President John F. Kennedy has gone up for auction. The piece of ragged dark blue leather was splashed with the blood of the 35th President when he was shot as he rode an open-top limousine through Dallas, Texas, in 1963. It is one of ten morbid relics of the killing which will go under the hammer at Los Angeles-based auctioneers Nate D. Sanders, with reserves as low as $250. 'Bloodstained': The strip of leather stained with the blood of President John F. Kennedy which is up for sale . It was 50 years ago last November that the Kennedy assassination shocked the world. People had lined the streets of Dallas to welcome the President when, as his motorcade drove through the city's Dealy Plaza, the sound of gunfire shattered their celebrations. At 7.30pm the Municipal Auditorium in Austin had been due to play host to a Texas welcome dinner in honour of President Kennedy, Vice President Lyndon Johnson and their wives. But JFK was pronounced dead at 1pm and the event was shelved as the nation mourned. Twenty-six staff name badges from that dinner are the star lot in the sale, with an estimate of $5,500. An invitation to the party is expected to make £500. It reads: 'In honour of John F. Kennedy and Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson. 'The State Democratic Executive Committee requests the pleasure of your company at the Texas Welcome Dinner.' Cancelled: An invitation to the banquet due to be held in Kennedy's honour later on the day he was shot . Unspoken words: A bound manuscript of the speech Kennedy was due to make that is also up for sale . Another lot is an unused press ticket for the dinner. It was to permit access to the balcony overlooking the auditorium and orders reporters to 'keep this portion of the ticket at all times'. One of the most prized in the collection is a booklet entitled, 'The Unspoken Words of John F. Kennedy at Dallas November 22, 1963'. The eight-page manuscript was the speech that JFK never gave because he was shot dead as he sat in his limousine and waved to admirers. It was privately printed in 1964 for Stanley Marcus, who died in 2002, the chairman of the board of luxury Dallas-based retailer Neiman Marcus. A Dallas Morning News edition bearing the headline 'Kennedy Slain on Dallas Street' and a copy of the Dallas Times Herald giving an account of his funeral and Oswald's killing are also going under the hammer. Old news: Original copies of Dallas dailies recounting the events of the assassination and its aftermath . But perhaps the most macabre item is a piece of leather from the back seat of the Lincoln Continental JFK was riding in when he was shot. The piece of ragged dark blue leather was kept by F. Vaughn Ferguson, the Technical Service Representative at the White House responsible for the presidential automobiles. After the assassination Mr Ferguson was told to prepare the bloody presidential limousine for the new president Lyndon B. Johnson. But he found the car dismantled by the FBI, who were searching for bullet fragmants and evidence. It was never used by Johnson. Macabre mementoes: The programme for the dinner and, right, an unused press ticket . A press pass for the event . The leather was later acquired Dr. John K. Lattimer, the ballistics expert consulted by the Kennedy family independently who confirmed the fatal shots were fired by Oswald. It has since been mounted in a display case that includes a picture of Kennedy just minutes before he was killed. A note included with the display says it is 'bloodstained', but this cannot be clearly seen to be the case from photographs. Doomed: President Kennedy and his wife smile at the crowds lining their motorcade route in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963.  Minutes later the President was assassinated as his car passed through Dealey Plaza . Unsuspecting: A still taken from film of Kennedy and his wife smiling at crowds seconds before he was shot . Kennedy was the 35th U.S. President, holding office from 1961 until his death two years later. During his brief presidency he oversaw some key historial events like the Bay of Pigs fiasco, the Cuban Missile Crisis and Project Apollo, which led to the moon landings. The mystery that still surrounds his death has caused many to speculate that he was murdered by the Mafia and even the U.S. Government. Lee Harvey Oswald, who remains the prime suspect in the assassiantion, was shot dead by nightclub owner Jack Ruby as he was being escorted by police days after the murder. Last year, an AP poll showed more than 59 per cent still believe more than one person was involved in killing Kennedy.","Strip of leather came from the back seat of Kennedy's Lincoln Continental .

"By . Damien Gayle . A policeman on duty in Bangkok: Officers in the Thai capital discovered nine children all apparently fathered by the same man when they raided a flat . A police raid on a Bangkok apartment found a pregnant women living with nine babies who are believed to share the same Japanese biological father. There were no documents found with the babies, leading workers at the emergency accommodation where they are being cared for to guess they are aged between two weeks and two years old. A Thai lawyer who was at the apartment at the time of yesterday's raid deepened the mystery by telling police that all nine babies were the children of one wealthy Japanese man. The discovery follows a scandal that erupted after an Australian couple were accused of abandoning a baby boy with Down syndrome born to a Thai surrogate, while taking home his twin sister. Authorities acting on a tip-off raided the condominium in the Lat Phrao area of the Thai capital on Tuesday. Deputy national police chief Aek Angsananont told Reuters a Thai man at the apartment said he was the lawyer of a Japanese businessman. Also present at the plush condominium in a city suburb were nine women, who told authorities they were nannies paid 10,000 baht ($310; £180) a month to look after the children. It was not immediately clear if the babies were also born to surrogate mothers, but the pregnant women found with them later told police she was acting as a surrogate. She said she was being paid . 'We are questioning the nannies, as well as asking for cooperation from the Japanese embassy, to help conduct DNA testing,' Mr Aek told Reuters. He added: 'If the Japanese man admits that all the children are his babies, we would ask him why he wanted to have so many babies.' Mr Aek told AFP the first task was to establish the identity of the children. 'We have to prove who their parents are with DNA tests, and determine if they were born naturally or by surrogacy,' he said, adding the probe would look at the legality of the surrogacies if any have taken place. It could take weeks to prove who their biological fathers and mothers are, police said. Thai authorities have stepped up their scrutiny of surrogacy in the kingdom, following the controversy involving the Australian couple who have denied they rejected the Down's baby - a seven-month-old named Gammy. The Thai surrogate mother said she agreed to carry another Thai donor's egg fertilised by the Australian man in exchange for around $14,900. The man, 56, has since been exposed as a convicted paedophile in Australia. Thai surrogate mother Pattaramon Chanbua, a 21-year-old food vendor, poses with Gammy, a nine-month old baby boy who was born with a Down syndrome, at a hospital in Sri Racha, Chonburi province, Thailand . Surrogacy is illegal in Thailand, unless it is with a relative, and offering money to carry a baby is banned, said medical officials in the kingdom, where the military recently seized power after a period of civil unrest. 'Surrogacy outside bloodline is illegal,' Boonruang Triruangworawat, of the Public Health Ministry, told reporters today. Despite that, there are 45 public and private surrogacy clinics in the kingdom and 240 doctors certified to carry out procedures. 'Currently clinic owners who allow (uncertified) doctors to perform surrogacy will be punished with one year in jail and a fine of $600,' said Mr Triruangworawat. In the wake of the baby Gammy scandal, Thailand's new junta rulers have vowed to beef up punishments and close current loopholes which they say are being exploited by foreigners seeking Thai surrogates. A draft bill proposes a tighter ban on commercial surrogacy carrying up to 10 years in jail for anyone - doctors, egg donors, prospective parents or surrogates - found in breach, according to a junta spokesman.","The children are thought to be aged between two weeks and two years old .

"By . James Gordon . As Google Glass becomes more widely available, the company has decided to host a number of events across the country to try and reassure people that are wary about the device. Google put its controversial eyewear on sale to the public for the first time last month but most people haven't had chance to see one, let alone use it. The firm offered its 'explorer edition', the $1500 test version of the eyewear, for general sale as the firm prepares to introduce the 'real' consumer version of the headware in the coming months. Glass Night Out or meetup events are being held this evening in eight cities: Boston; Los Angeles; Madison, Milwaukee; New York; Orlando, Palo Alto and Washington, D.C. Scroll down for video... Trendy? Glass wearers are planning meetups in a series of Glass Night Out events across the country Saturday . 'This Saturday night, you and Glass are going out! Explorers across the US are getting together to mingle, snack, and cheers for the first Glass Night Out,' the company wrote in a Google+ posting. 'In the words of +JR Curley, these events are part of a community initiative to have a formal Explorer meet up, team with local businesses, and help dispel Glass myths to all.' Those who currently own the device paid $1,500 to be part of the development process, exchanging ideas on improvements to the design and function in return for the coveted device. With the release of the second-generation, those already enrolled in the Google Explorer program  were able to 'invite' three of their friends to the scheme. Google is hoping its Explorer faithful will help 'dispel Glass myths to all' Google . recently revealed the first official etiquette guide for its Glass . wearable computer - and admits users have been seen as 'creepy and rude' for wearing the device. The . firm warns users to ask people's permission before recording them, and . warns against 'glassing out' where they focus on the screen too much. The . guide comes as Google is expanding the number of people who have the . $1500 prototypes, ahead of an expected release later this year. 'With new technology comes new questions, and our Explorers help to answer those questions,' Google said. 'Since the program started, our Explorers have gotten a lot of attention when they wear Glass out and about. 'Reactions . range from the curious – 'Wow! Are those the ‘Google glasses’? How do . they work?” – to the suspect – 'Goodness gracious do those things see . into my soul?!' Reaction to the new design has been mixed, with some critics saying changes to the device looked bulky. Google . has come under fire for the unfashionable look of Glass, although has . developed its own frames for the system which allow prescription lenses, . and partnered with Ray-Ban to develop fashionable frames. The 'Glass Night Out' is part of a continued effort to reduce the polarizing effect of the glass headsets, which let users snap photos, shoot video, perform a search and do lots of other smartphone-like tasks in front of their eyes. The idea of a computer and recording device on one's head has made some non-Glass users uncomfortable, and it has pushed the conversation about etiquette and social norms in a connected world. Establishments including bars and movie theaters have kicked out Explorers (whom critics call 'Glassholes'). In February, Google released an etiquette guide explaining how users can avoid being labeled a 'Glasshole' when strutting around with the headware.

"By . Damien Gayle . A wealthy Russian who survived an attempt on his life in London cannot be extradited to face murder charges in Moldova because it would breach his human rights. A judge at Westminster Magistrates Court ruled that Moldovan authorities had failed to give assurances that German Gorbuntsov, 48, would not be tortured in their custody. Mr Gorbuntsov said after the hearing that he believes there is a half-million-pound contract on his life. In 2012 an assassin shot him six times outside his flat in Docklands. German Gorbuntsov outside court today: He will not be extradited to face charges of ordering a contract killing in Moldova after a judge ruled that the country's authorities had failed to guarantee he would not be tortured . Moldovan prosecutors accuse Mr Gurbuntsov of ordering the contract killing of a rival businessman in a fight for control of a bank worth more than £5million. He was detained on a European Arrest Warrant but today a judge ruled he could remain in Britain because the former Soviet republic could not guarantee he would not be subjected to torture or degrading or inhumane treatment. After the decision, Mr Gorbuntsov, speaking through a translator, told reporters: 'The English Court made the right decision. 'I can say one thing, the justice system in Great Britain is straight forward and fair. Investigators and detectives did more than I had hoped. 'But the threat is still there. It was a Moldovan person with eight bullets that tried to kill me. 'The Moldovan government has declared that they will pay £500,000 if somebody will bring me in a body bag. Living in fear: Mr Gorbuntsov came out of hiding to attend court today accompanied by his partner, Natalia Semchenkova, pictured left, and bodyguards . 'The man who tried to have me killed is now a presidential candidate in Moldova, he could be the most powerful man in the country. 'The man who shot me has been arrested, he is now in Romania where he is accused of other murders. 'Three weeks ago I had a serious operation to help heal the injuries from the attempt on my life, I have been left with a 70cm scar on my stomach. 'Now we will go to celebrate and I will continue my treatment. 'I plan to stay here in the UK, I have a family here and I have children here but this has effected everything, my life, my business. 'I am under police protection, I am paying for it out of my own money, but it is dangerous to go out in public. I still fear for my life, of course.' Mr Gorbuntsov's past is not well known. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, he made a fortune operating banks in Russia and Moldova and set up nearly 40 companies involved in security, construction, real estate and finance. He fled to Britain in 2010, following the attempted murder of another financier, Alexander Antonov, in Moscow - a crime in which he was implicated but of which he has consistently maintained his innocence. In March 2012, Mr Gorbuntsov had just stepped from a taxi outside his Docklands apartment black when a would-be assassin emerged frm the shadows. He was shot six times with an automatic pistol before he was able to punch the code in the front door lock and leap behind a wall just a few feet from the entrance. Since the attempt on his life, which he claims was ordered by the same men who arranged the attack on Mr Antonov, he has lived in a secret location under armed police guard. He broke cover to attend court today accompanied by his partner, Natalia Semchenkova, and bodyguards. Moldovan prosecutors allege that Mr Gorbuntsov ordered the contract killing of Renat Usatiy who had bought a stake in Universal Bank in Moldova for £1.2 million at a time when Mr Gorbuntsov was facing debt problems. According to Mr Usatiy, who spoke to the Mail on Sunday about the claims last year, Mr Gorbuntsov accused him of trying to steal the bank from under his nose. When Mr Usatiy refused to give up his investment, he claims Mr Gorbuntsov ordered his assassination. 'Fearful of what could happen, I increased my security and brought my armoured car from Moscow to Chisinau [the Moldovan capital], and went to the police,' he said. Westminster Magistrates Court: Ben Lloyd, representing the Moldovan Government, was unable to tell the court why a letter from prosecutors had failed to address the issues surrounding Mr Gorbuntzov's human rights . Flanked by a uniformed police officer, the Mr Gorbuntsov stood in the dock today wearing a grubby black t-shirt and black tracksuit pants, speaking only to confirm his name through an interpreter. Alun Jones QC, representing Mr Gorbuntsov, said Moldovian authorities had failed to provide written assurances they would respect article three of the European Convention of Human Rights, as had been required by a previous hearing. Article three prohibits, without exceptions of limitations, torture and 'inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment' - a human right which applies 'irrespective of a victim's conduct', courts have ruled. Mr Jones said experts had given evidence about the appalling conditions in Moldovan prisons. 'The Chief Magistrate Howard Riddle said that the CPS and the requesting authority should provide evidence to rebut it, if not [the extradition request] would be dismissed,' he said. British prosecutors had received correspondence from the Moldovan authorities, but Mr Jones said: 'We didn't hear anything until yesterday until a letter arrived yesterday. 'It is a dummy letter, it does not do anything at all, it does not address the issues. 'Mr Gorbuntsov has spent much of the month of June in hospital after undergoing a serious operation, we have been to this court now for four weeks. 'Our submission is the case should now be thrown out and discharged immediately.' Ben Lloyd, representing the Moldovan Government, was unable to tell the court why the letter had failed to address the issues surrounding Mr Gorbuntzov's human rights. He said: 'I don't make a submission that this is a significant document, I think that is all I can say.' Making his ruling Judge Ikram said: 'There have been three cases previously where Article Three has been raised in relation to the Republic of Moldova. 'There has been no evidence to rebut the evidence in relation to conditions within prisons in that country. 'A letter was received by those who act for the requesting authority that seems to be a recital of the law and does not, it seems to be considered by all parties, deal with the issue in hand. 'I must come to the same conclusion and therefore based on the evidence that has been accepted by this court on previous hearings I come to the view that the Warrant should be discharged. 'You are free to go.' There was applause from the public gallery, while Gorbuntzov looked confused as a Russian interpreter explained that he had been freed. Mr Gorbuntzov's lawyers applied for some of his costs to be paid by the British government.","German Gorbuntsov was shot six times outside his Docklands home in 2012 .

"By . Damien Gayle . Former Arsenal ace Patrick Vieira is to build a new 'iceberg' home in Hampstead after he was granted permission to demolish the £3million mansion in its place. Vieira's three-storey property in the leafy north London district will be torn down and replaced with a four-storey, five-bedroom palace over more than 9,000sq/ft, plans show. Camden Council has given them go-ahead after months of wrangling to accomodate neighbours who feared not only months of disruption but also that the new house would overlook their homes and gardens. Scroll down for video . How Patrick Vieira's new house, left, will look in the context of it's neighbourhood in Hampstead, north London . Plans were lodged with the council more than a year ago under the name of Vieira's Trinidadian wife, Cheryl Plaza. The new home, built in dark brick, will be a 'very private space' which is 'set into the gradient of the hillside' and boasts 'views across the treetops'. The basement level will include parking for two cars - reached by a car lift and assisted by a mechanised turntable - as well as a cinema room and extensive storage space. The ground floor will have a gym, games room and bar, swimming pool, solarium and two guest suites; the first floor will have a large open plan kitchen and dining area, as well as a raised lawn area; and the third floor will have the master bedroom and two further bedrooms, all en-suite, and another balcony. According to reports, Vieira decided to demolish the existing building, which was built in the late 1980s and already includes an indoor pool, after he discovered it was riddled with damp. The proposed development as seen from another angle. Neighbours objected to the plans saying that the new house could overlook their homes, cause light pollution and that building work could damage nearby properties . But a flurry of objections, which raised fears that the new property would ruin the character of the conservation area and overlook nearby homes, made planning officials think twice about granting permission. One neighbour objected to a 20m-long window planned for the main stairwell of the home that he feared would 'spoil the quite (sic) and dark rural character of the area at night'. 'I accept that this will not result in overlooking but I am very concerned about the light spill to me and my neighbours,' he wrote. 'The glazing would light the main stairwell which feeds all rooms and is therefore likely to be lit at ALL times.' Another raised fears the plans for the excavations, which would delve nearly 5m below the foundation level of the property's north-west corner, could cause damage to nearby buildings. A third accused Vieira and his wife of failing to consult with any of the nearby neighbours in what the objection called 'this very sensitive environmental and conservation area'. 'This lack of prior neighbour consultation is extremely rare in this Conservation Area,' the objection said. 'We can only surmise that the applicant ... never intends to live in the new house proposed and so could not care about neighbourhood sentiments.' Patrick Vieira and his wife Cheryl: The couple also have a £2.2million home in Alderly Edge, Cheshire . The house as it currently looks. It dates back to the late-1980s and is being torn down now after Vieira discovered that it was riddled with damp. Neighbours suspect he wants to then sell on the new development . Following months of negotiations, the couple have made concessions, including axing plans for a roof terrace and, according to reports, agreeing to pay £48,000 towards community infrastructure. The Evening Standard quoted a planning official as saying: 'The applicant has supplied a satisfactory construction management plan to show that the proposal would not harm the local transport network, and the basement impact has been independently assessed and considered to comply with the relevant policies.' Vieira, 38, was born in Senegal but moved to France with his family when he was eight. In a glittering football career he won three Premier League titles with Arsenal, and four Serie A titles with Juventus and Internazionale. He has 107 caps for France, playing in their 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000-winning sides. He finished his career at Manchester City, where he is now manager of the club's Elite Development Squad. He also has a £2.2million home in Alderley Edge, Cheshire.","Current three-storey home to be torn down because it's riddled with damp .

"By . Damien Gayle . The misery of Palestinians in Gaza has been brought home to the UK after a Yorkshire man lost 11 members of his family to a single Israeli air strike. Musheir El-Farrah, a civil engineer from Sheffield, learned on Friday morning that his cousin's home in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, was hit by a warplane overnight. Five children, aged from four to 15, are among the dead. Five of Mr El-Farrah's relatives - including his cousin Mahmoud El-Farra - are fighting for their lives in intensive care. Scroll down for video . Musheir El-Farrah holds printed photographs of his relatives who were killed in an Israeli air strike last week . 'I found out at 7am on Friday through a Facebook message from a friend that 11 members of my family had been killed,' said Mr El-Farrah. 'They all died at around 3.45am on Friday morning. They were in bed sleeping when the first missile hit and so they were trying to get to safety. 'They ran and they were hit outside the building where they live. They were all still in their pyjamas and nighties when they were killed.' The El-Farrahs were killed in a flurry of Israeli air strikes just over an hour before a ceasefire was due to temporarily halt the relentless bombardment of the Gaza Strip. 'It's absolutely terrible. The school that the children attend is due to hold a ceremony to remember them. It is just so sad,' said Mr El-Farrah. 'On the same day 26 others were killed. These are innocent people trying to go about their own lives. They have no connection with these killers. 'The rest of the neighbourhood is so scared that people are afraid to even leave their homes. 'I was born in this town, Khan Younis, and it's extremely worrying. It's no longer the place it used to be. 'It's a constant worry, especially with the rest of my extended family living out there. How much more do these innocent people have to suffer? 'They have cut off the water and electricity, meaning what lives they do have are affected. 'I spoke to one relative the other day who had queued for three hours just to get ten litres. That is for the whole of his family.

Israel's global standing has taken a nose dive after nearly 2,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have been killed in the 27 days that its forces have waged war on the besieged territory. With public opinion turning against the Jewish state, even the leaders of usually staunch allies such as the U.S., Britain and France have felt compelled to condemn attacks on UN-run facilities which have offered sanctuary to Gazans fleeing Israeli bombs. Israeli leaders say the campaign will not stop until militant groups linked to Hamas, the Islamist party that runs Gaza, stop firing rockets over the border. Rockets and mortar attacks from Gaza have killed three Israeli civilians during the current campaign. Hamas has refused to give up its attacks until Israel lifts a seven-year-long blockade which effectively cut Gaza off from the world and frees thousands of prisoners held in 'administrative detention' in Israeli jails. Palestinians collect the dead in the village of Khuza'a, east of Khan Younis, on Friday . Ninety UN-run schools are providing shelter to 270,000 Palestinians ordered to leave their homes before Israeli troops marched into Gaza, according to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. UNRWA, which organises humanitarian relief for Palestinian refugees across the Middle East, has warned that its staff and operations 'are at breaking point'. Mr El-Farrah says he has lost relatives to Israeli military action before, but never on such a scale. The five children of his family killed were Nadine El-Farra, 15, Muhammad El-Farra, 11, Yara El-Farra, eight, Abdul Rahman El-Farra, eight, and Lujaine El-Farra, four. 'Initially nine of them died and others died later in hospital. Five of them were children. 'People in the neighbourhood came out to carry the dead, and they were injured and killed between the second and third missiles. 'These people have the most sophisticated weapons with the most sophisticated viewing equipment. 'Why did they do that? I don't understand.'","Five children were among the relatives of Musheir El-Farrah killed on Friday .

"By . Damien Gayle . Absconded: Wayne Whitley, 40, walked out of HMP Kirkham in Lancashire 12 days ago . An armed robber serving a life sentence for a series of violent raids has become the third convict to walk out of the same open prison this month. Police have warned the public not to approach Wayne Whitley, 40, from Manchester, who went missing from HMP Kirkham, Lancashire, 12 days ago. His escape was revealed by Greater Manchester Police (GMP) today as a raft of bleak figures revealed a leap in the number of on-the-run inmates in the past year. Whitley, who disappeared on July 19, is the third prisoner to abscond from HMP Kirkham this month. Philip Stephenson, 33, and Gareth Robinson, 24, left the Category D facility earlier in July. Stephenson was serving a sentence for firearms offences while Robinson was in prison for burglary, Greater Manchester Police said at the time. Whitley, who has links to areas across Greater Manchester, is a black man of slim athletic build, said a statement from GMP. It is unknown what he was wearing when he left prison. 'He is not to be approached by members of the public,' said Detective Inspector Robert Cousen, from GMP's Serious Crime Division. 'If anyone sees him or knows of his whereabouts, please contact GMP on 101 immediately.' Sources who would prefer to pass on information anonymously are asked to contact Crimestoppers. Det Insp Cousen said: 'I would also urge Whitley to hand himself in at his nearest police station and to remind people that if anyone is found to be assisting or harbouring Whitley, they too will face being arrested and a possible prison sentence of their own.' Elsewhere, it emerged that a prison officer had part of his ear bitten off by an inmate during an attack at Nottingham Prison. The latest prison walk-out emerged as Ministry of Justice figures showed, in the words of shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan, 'violence is up, deaths in custody are up and the number of prisoners going on the run is up.' A total of nearly 230 inmates escaped or absconded from prisons in England and Wales last year, the figures showed, 10 per cent more than the previous year. These include 137 who walked out of open prisons, including Michael Wheatley - known as the 'Skullcracker' - who sparked a nationwide manhunt after absconding from HMP Standford Hill on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent. Two male criminals fled jails and another two escaped prisoner escorts, the figures show. Ninety absconders who have disappeared from prisons in the last decade were still at large at the end of last month, and another 79 have not returned after being granted temporary release since 2004. Meanwhile the number of attacks on prison staff soared to its highest level for six years - up by more than a tenth to 3,363 in the 12 months to March - prompting suggestions that jails in England and Wales have become 'places of extreme violence'. And the number of prisoners who died in custody jumped by nearly a quarter in the year to March to reach its highest level for almost a decade. A total of 225 inmates died in jail in 2013/14, compared with 181 in the same period the previous year. This was the highest number since 2005. Critics said the figures were evidence that the country's prisons were 'in crisis'. Mr Khan told the Press Association: 'The Government is trying to hide the sheer scale of the failings in the Ministry of Justice from the public by trying to pretend there's not a problem, let alone a crisis. 'This is all evidence of the incompetence of David Cameron's Government. 'The evidence is piling up that the Government has caused a prison crisis. The courses, training and healthcare needed to make sure prisoners are reformed aren't happening. 'Staring at their cell walls for hours on end, surrounded by death and violence, will do nothing to stop offenders committing further crimes on their release.' The national crowding rate in prisons was 22.9 per cent - meaning nearly one in four prisoners is being held in a cell, cubicle or room where the number of occupants exceeds the 'uncrowded' capacity. Glyn Travis, of the Prison Officers' Association, told PA: 'The prison population is increasing and despite changes introduced by the Ministry of Justice we still believe that inappropriate prisoners are being sent to open conditions as the service tries to manage its available cellular accommodation.' 'Incompetence': Labour justice spokesman Sadiq Khan, left, said today's figures showed there was a 'prison crisis', but Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, right, defended the service's performance in a 'period of change' Conservative Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said the service had experienced a 'significant period of change' and admitted it had been 'a challenge'. Although the number of absconds has risen year on year, the total of 225 was the third lowest since the current method of counting was introduced in 2004. Mr Grayling told PA: 'Over the last couple of years we have seen a major programme of reform across both prisons and probation - aimed at providing the best service to the public while lowering the cost to the taxpayer. 'In this current economic climate all public services are required to help ease the burden. We are not exempt from that and have reduced our overall budget by 24%, through sensible and well-considered reforms, commended by the National Audit Office. 'As with any significant period of change - coupled with prison population increases higher than expected - it has been a challenge. We are responding to and managing the additional pressures but prisons are still running safe and decent regimes.' Referring specifically to the figures on absconding prisoners, Mr Grayling said open prisons and temporary licence are 'important tools in rehabilitating long-term offenders', but stressed they 'will not be used at the expense of public safety'. He added that absconds have reached record lows under the coalition Government, while the eligibility for open prisons has been tightened. Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: 'The tragic rise in the numbers of self-inflicted deaths in custody is the most vivid of the flashing warning signs of a prison service placed under unprecedented strain.'","Wayne Whitley is the third prisoner to walk out of HMP Kirkham this month .

"By . Damien Gayle . A Romanian builder who was left with half a head after a bad fall at work has had his skull rebuilt thanks to donations from well-wishers. Disfigured and unable to work, Elvis Romeo Lingurar, from Livada, north-west Romania, could not afford the 1,000 euros he needed to pay for a prosthetic to replace the missing parts of his skull. But after his story was reported in MailOnline and elsewhere earlier this year, generous readers who took pity on his plight sent him money to help pay for his surgery. Scroll down for video . Before and after: Elvis Romeo Lingurar, pictured left before the reconstructive surgery on his skull, and right, after the £791 procedure which was paid for by the help of wellwishers who read of his plight in the news . Now, with his head restored almost back to the way it was before his accident, the 24-year-old says he feels overwhelmed by the generosity of those who helped him. 'I feel much better now, I thank God for the second chance he has given to me. I also want to thank all the people for their help, and not to forget the doctors for their help for this surgery,' he said. Mr Lingurar had been working on scaffolding around a demolition site last year when he lost his balance and fell six feet, smashing his head on the concrete below. The hard landing shattered the left side of his skull and put him in a coma. He developed a blood clot on his brain and doctors were forced to remove the damaged parts of bone to save his life. Restored: Viewed from the side, you can see the scar where Mr Lingurar's prosthetic has been placed. Before the operation, Mr Lingura couldn't work because his vulnerable brain was protected only by skin . Although Romania, like Britain, has free universal healthcare, coverage did not extend to the surgery Mr Lingurar needed to repair his skull, and he was forced to live with his disfigurement. With his brain protected only by skin stretched across the remaining portions of his skull, he was left unable to work since the slightest knock on his head could have proved fatal. 'I prayed to God all the time to help me, every Sunday I go to church and pray,' he said. 'When I was in the hospital [after the accident] I was scared that I would never get back to normal, especially when I saw myself in the mirror with half a head. 'After a week in hospital I went home, where I spent three months recovering. Altogether I was left with half a head for 13 months. 'I couldn't afford to have my head fixed so I decided to go on the street and beg people for money.' 'I thank God for the second chance': Mr Lingurar said that after a year out of work, he hopes to get back soon . Local journalist Alex Prunean discovered Mr Lingurar and filmed an interview with him in an effort to highlight his situation. After that, news outlets worldwide picked up the story. Now, thanks to readers who took pity on Mr Lingura and reached out to help, he has had the life-changing surgery he needed to get him back to normal. 'I wasn't afraid for the second surgery to repair my head either because I told myself that if I got over the first one, I will get over this one too,' he said. He added: 'The surgery took four or five hours. I didn't look in the mirror immediately after. Three days after a nurse came to change my bandages and I asked her to take a picture on me on a phone so I could send it to my family. 'When I saw myself I was very happy to finally be back to normal. 'My family were very happy for me too, I haven't been able to work for a year but I help my family with everything I can and I hope to get back to work very soon.'","Elvis Romeo Lingurar couldn't afford a prosthetic implant to replace his skull .

"By . Damien Gayle . and James Chapman . Europe last night imposed the toughest sanctions against Russia since the Cold War, sending the rouble into a tailspin and prompting warnings that British firms will be hit hard. EU leaders agreed unanimously to embargoes against vast sectors of the Russian economy, designed to cripple its banks, energy firms and defence capabilities. Russia will face sweeping new sanctions in response to its alleged support of rebel militants in east Ukraine. Scroll down for video . Russian president Vladimir Putin: Russia faces sweeping new sanctions from both the U.S. and the EU . The 28-nation bloc has imposed an arms embargo, banking curbs and a ban on trade in sensitive and dual-use technologies to punish Russia for its actions in its neighbouring country. Two diplomats told the Associated Press the measures were decided today at a meeting of EU ambassadors. A further eight Russians will also face asset freezes and travel bans. The new EU sanctions came as John Kerry, U.S. Secretary of State, warned that Washington is also drawing up fresh sanctions against its old enemy. 'We are in the process of preparing additional sanctions, with Europe,' Mr Kerry told reporters, shortly after meeting with new Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin at the State Department. But he added that Russian President Vladimir Putin 'still has a choice going forward with respect to his ability to be able to have an impact with the separatists.' Europe's arms embargo will block any trade with Russia in weapons or 'related material'. With its own major arms industry stemming from the era of Cold War isolation, Russia has little need to import weapons from the EU, but sells more than 3billion euros worth a year to member states. However, the embargo will apply only to future contracts, so one big deal that won't be affected is the heavily criticised 1.2billion-euro sale of two French helicopter carriers to Russia, which has already been agreed. The EU's banking curbs are a more significant step. They will deny Russia's state-owned banks access to European capital markets by banning Europeans from buying their bonds, equities or financial instruments with a higher maturity than 90 days. Last year nearly half the bonds issued by Russia's state-run financial institutions were traded in the EU's financial markets, according to The Guardian. AFP reported that Mr Kerry also revealed he had again raised concerns over Russia's role in stirring unrest in eastern Ukraine during a telephone call Tuesday with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov. Russia has denied supporting the separatists, but Mr Kerry maintained that he and Mr Lavrov had 'agreed that there is a way to try to put some very specific proposals on the table to try to move forward.' High-level diplomacy: Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin, left, and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry arrive to speak to reporters after a bilateral meeting at the State Department in Washington . Over the weekend, U.S. officials released what they say are images of Russian artillery firing from inside their country on Ukrainian military positions. 'President Putin can make a huge difference here if he chooses to, and we and our European partners will take additional measures and impose wider sanctions on key sections of the Russian economy if that is what we must do,' Mr Kerry said. 'We hope that it will not be necessary. And if Russia continues to go down this path, however, Russia will leave the international community with no choice.' Mr Kerry again pointed out the difficulties being faced by international investigators trying to gain access to the site where a Malaysian airliner was downed 10 days ago, killing all 298 people on board. 'Without this access, they have no way to collect debris, no way to collect other evidence from the scene in order to be able to provide the kind of examination that is necessary,' he was quoted as saying by AFP. 'They still can't even ensure that all of the victims' remains have been removed, and that is an unsupportable burden for any family to have to bear, and it is an unacceptable standard for behaviour. 'The site has to be cordoned off, the evidence has to be preserved, and Russia needs to use its considerable influence among the separatists in order to be able to help ensure this basic approach of common decency.' This is Europe: A woman stands in front of an apartment block in Horlivka, east Ukraine, which was hit by shells fired by government forces as they make a concerted push to retake the town from separatists . Firefighters try to extinguish fires after homes and vehicles were destroyed by shelling in Horlivka . As Mr Kerry spoke, shells smashed into a residential neighbourhood of Donetsk as Ukrainian forces intensified their campaign to encircle the rebel stronghold. The shelling killed at least two people, blew gaping holes in an apartment block and raised fears that the city is on the verge of severe bloodshed. Fighting also raged elsewhere in Ukraine's troubled east, bringing the death toll to at least 24 civilians and 10 soldiers over the past day. And it prevented international investigators once again from visiting the site of the Malaysia Airlines jet shot down earlier this month. The increased danger to civilians has brought sharp criticism from the United Nations and human rights groups. But the Associated Press reports that each side blames the other for shelling residential areas. The rebels insist the attacks are evidence of what they describe as the government's indiscriminate oppression of its own people. But Ukraine insists that it has banned the use of artillery in residential areas and in turn accuses separatists of targeting civilians in an effort to discredit the army. Medics treat people who were wounded in shelling in Horlivka, which is under siege by Ukrainian forces . A man is moved from a stretcher on to a bed at the hospital, where 17 people have been killed by the shelling . Elderly women lie on the floor at the now-overcrowded hospital in Horlivka . The Donetsk shelling sent about 50 frightened residents to huddle for safety in an underground parking lot, including Lubov Skorikh who was distraught at discovering that her husband Vladimir had been killed. 'I ran out. ... An old woman told me, ""Look, there is a man lying there."" I didn't even think that could be my husband. But then I saw the shoes; they were his shoes,"" she tearfully told an Associated Press reporter. 'Do you understand? His shoes! My God, I lived with him for 45 years; he was such a good person.' In Horlivka, a city besieged by government troops, the mayor's office reported Tuesday that 17 people, including three children, were killed as a result of shelling. The mayor's office said there has been major damage to many homes and government offices in the centre of the city. It also said the top floor of a school was destroyed as a result of a direct hit from a shell. People hide in the basement of their apartment block which they have converted into a bomb shelter . A woman covers her ears as others bury their faces in their hands as shells rain down on Horlivka . A U.N. monitoring mission in Ukraine says there has been an alarming build up of heavy weaponry in civilian areas of Donetsk and Luhansk - including artillery, tanks, rockets and missiles that are being used to inflict increasing casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure. The U.N. said in a report this week that use of such weaponry could amount to a violation of international humanitarian law. 'There is an increase in the use of heavy weaponry in areas that are basically surrounded by public buildings,' said Gianni Magazzeni, head of the UN office that oversees Ukraine. 'All international law needs to be applied and fully respected.' New York-based Human Rights Watch has been more categorical in its accusations against the government and last week produced what it said was evidence the army had fired on houses in the suburbs of Donetsk. The overall death toll has been steadily rising. The U.N. has said that at least 1,129 people were killed between mid-April, when fighting began, and July 26.","Arms embargo will only apply to future contracts, meaning sale will go ahead .

"By . Damien Gayle . The birth of a baby is always special, but early this morning a little girl was born who has a special significance to an entire nation. With the arrival of Jennalyn Sentino the Philippines has become only the 12th country in the world to have a population of more than 100million people. She was one of 100 babies born in state-run hospitals all over the sprawling archipelago who were given the symbolic designation of '100,000,000th baby'. Philippines Health Secretary Enrique makes a speech as Ona Dailin Cabigayan looks down at her newborn daughter, Jennalyn Sentino, whose arrival this morning pushed the country's population past 100million people . Jennalyn is one of 100 babies born in Filipino state hospitals who have been designated '100,000,000th baby' The Filipino government will monitor each of the 100 babies to make sure they are getting health services . The milestone has been a cause for celebration in the Philippines, but officials say it highlights the challenge of providing for more people in the already-impoverished country. Juan Antonio Perez, executive director of the official Commission on Population, told AFP: 'This is both an opportunity and a challenge... an opportunity we should take advantage of and a challenge we recognise.' While a growing population means a larger workforce, it also means more dependants in a country where about 25 percent of people are living in poverty, he said. He said the Philippines had to find a way to bring services to the poorest families while also lowering the average number of children that fertile women will bear in their lifetimes. 'We'd like to push the fertility rate down to two children per (woman's) lifetime,' from the current level of an average of three per woman, he said. The government has contributed to the celebrations surrounding the births with gifts of cake, clothing and blankets. But it also has plans to monitor each of the 100 children throughout their lives to make sure they getting the health services they need, said Mr Perez. Father Clemente Sentino, 45, strokes his daughter's head as Miss Cabigayan smiles: Officials say the milestone births highlight the challenge of providing for more people in the already-impoverished country . Mother and baby pose with the certificate handed to Jennalyn on her birth, as the child's father looks on . Clemente Sentino, Jennalyn's 45-year-old father, said he was grateful for government aid, but seemed confident he could support his child and his partner. He and the child's mother, Dailin Cabigayan, 27, are not yet married. 'She just happened to get pregnant. But we do have plans to get married,' said Mr Sentino, a van driver. The parents look down at their child. Despite official worries over population growth, Mr Sentino, a van driver, seemed confident he could support his family . 'I make just enough to get by but at least my job pays regularly. We will find a way to make it fit,' he said. Population control efforts in the Philippines, where four in five people are Catholic, have been stymied by the influence of the Roman Church, which regards contraception as sinful. It was only in April that the government finally overcame over a decade of Church opposition to implement a reproductive health law providing the poor with birth control services. About two to three million women who previously did not have access to family planning now do, said Mr Perez. Father Melvin Castro, head of the commission on family and life of the country's Catholic bishops, was quoted by a church-run radio station as praising the ballooning population. There would now be more 'young workers' to power the economy, he said. President Benigno Aquino's spokesman Herminio Coloma said the milestone showed the importance of making 'the right investments in people'. The government had prepared for this by spending more on 'human development', particularly education, he told reporters. Meanwhile, Klaus Beck, country representative of the United Nations Population Fund, endorsed the Philippines' new focus on family planning in a statement issued to coincide with the population landmark. 'Governments that are serious about eradicating poverty should also be serious about providing the services, supplies, information that women, men and young people need to exercise their reproductive rights,' he said.","Jennalyn Sentino is one of Pinoy 100 newborns named '100,000,000 baby'

"By . Damien Gayle . Americans are notoriously incompetent when it comes to locating foreign countries on a map - even those where the world's superpower is waging war. But it seems the deficiency cuts both ways, with many foreigners unable to identify where the 50 states of the union can be located, research has found. When asked to click their mouse on where they thought a state was located, most foreigners were only able to recognise New York, California, Florida and Texas, with most of the rest a mere blur. Scroll down for video . Many foreigners are unable to identify the 50 states of the union, particularly mid-West states like Wyoming . Real-estate listings site Movoto used an online game to ask 400 people from outside the U.S. to hover their cursor over each state as its name popped up. While the four states which appear most in Hollywood films and exported U.S. television programmes were well recognised, and many knew at least whether a state was in New England, when it came to the rest of the western, mid-western and southern states, results were abysmal. 'Colorado, Wyoming and Utah were all frequently confused with one another, while the placement of Ohio stretched from Indiana all the way to Kansas,' said Chris Kolmar, Movoto's 'chief armchair economist'. 'Kansas itself was often placed in Utah, or even Arkansas. And almost nobody was able to locate Georgia correctly.' He said that most respondents, whether or not they were right, seemed confident in their choice 'even when they were placing Virginia somewhere around Nebraska, or relocating Pennsylvania to South Carolina.' Real-estate listings site Movoto used an online game to ask 400 people from outside the to hover their cursor over each state as its name popped up . The results will be pleasing for Americans, who have been globally mocked for their lack of knowledge of the world beyond U.S. borders. A poll of about 500 young Americans aged between 18 and 24 conducted for National Geographic in 2006 found that 6 per cent were unable to even locate their own country on a map of the world. It also found that only just more than a third were able to locate Iraq on a map of the Middle East, despite the U.S. staging a full-scale occupation of the country at the time. A study published in the European Journal Communication in 2009 which compared knowledge of international affairs among Britons, Danes, Finns and Americans found U.S. citizens came consistently last. Just 58 per cent of Americans knew who the Taliban were, compared to three quarters of Britons. However it did find that Americans were most likely to be able to identify Nouri al-Maliki as the prime minister of Iraq, with three in ten answering correctly, compared to just more than one in five of Britons. More recently, a Newsweek experiment which set 1,000 Americans the challenge of completing their country's citizenship test found 29 per cent could not name the current vice president and almost three quarters did not know what the Cold War was about. In 2003 a U.S. Strategic Task Force of Education abroad report warned that Americans' ignorance of world affairs was so bad it amounted to a threat to national security. Mr Kolmar concluded his report on foreigners' knowledge of the 50 states by saying: 'Whether at home or abroad, it seems like just about everyone could stand to brush up on their geography.' However, some have more work to do than others.","New York, California, Florida and Texas were most frequently recognised .

They were initially going to split up, but made a suicide pact after deciding that although they couldn't live together, nor could they live without each other. According to police spokesman Li De, the couple had first smashed a bottle and used a piece of glass to cut their wrists so they could bleed to death together. But the glass did not slice deep enough and, when they found themselves still breathing 20 minutes later, they switched on their oven and let gas fill the flat before striking a match. The mixture was too thin to start an explosion, foiling their suicide a second time. Ke tries to swing her leg up to clamber back on to the balcony, after botching their third suicide attempt . 'They then decided to jump to their deaths and climbed onto the other side of the balcony in their flat,' said Mr Li. 'They were both holding each other and went to jump. But at the last minute he changed his mind and grabbed onto the railings, and as she had her hands around his neck she also ended up hanging from him. 'Both of them were screaming for help.' Firefighters finally show up and lift Ke to safety. After their rescue they fell into each other's arms and declared their love for each other. But now they faces charges over their attempt to kill themselves with a gas explosion . Their calls alerted neighbours, who called the fire brigade. Firefighters broke into the flat and grabbed Mei, who was clinging on to her lover's neck with the last of her strength. 'They then grabbed the man and helped him back to the right side,' said Mr Li. 'After which the couple fell into each other's arms and declared their love for each other.' They now face charges over the attempt to blow up the flat. Police in the city of Zhuhai, Guangdong province, south-east China, said a report had been handed to prosecutors.","Ke Mei and Liu Meng were on their third attempted suicide of the day .

"By . Damien Gayle . An endurance runner who was struck by lighting halfway through a mountain race not only kept going for another 12 hours but still managed to clinch third place. Canadian runner Adam Campbell and his pace-setter Aaron Heidt were caught in the storm as they approached the highest point of the Hardrock 100 race in Silverton, Colorado. Stuck on open ground atop the 14,000ft Handies Peak, they were left with no choice but to try to run through it. Then lightning struck 200 metres ahead of them. Shock result: Endurance runner Adam Campbell clutches his hard-earned bronze medal after he was struck by lightning halfway through the Hardrock 100 race in Colorado and still managed to come in third place . Remembering the old adage about lightning never striking twice, they pushed on. It was the wrong decision. 'Right when we hit the summit, we heard a huge crack and a flash of light and both of us got knocked to the ground,' Mr Campbell told Michael Platt of the Calgary Sun. 'I heard the battery on my headlamp pop — and we were laying there looking at each other, and we both swore. 'It was really scary, with lightning going on all around us — you’re in shock, like ""were we really just struck by lightning in the middle of a race?"" 'That just doesn’t happen. Of all the things you prepare for, this isn’t one of them.' Mr Campbell during the race, which he completed in 25 hours, 56 minutes and 36 seconds . The Hardrock 100 race through the back country of the San Juan Mountains is touted as one of America's most difficult trail-running races. Runners compete around a 100.5-mile loop linking the mining towns of Silverton, Telluride, Ouray and Lake City, with an average elevation of 11,000ft and a high point of 14,000 ft. Mr Campbell and Mr Heidt had just scaled that high point, some 60 miles into the race, when the storm struck. Mr Campbell, an accomplished marathon runner who works as a lawyer in Calgary, Alberta, told, Brian Metzler, editor-in-chief of Competitor: 'There's nothing up there, no place to hide, no rocks, no trees, nothing. 'We didn't really have much of a choice. We wanted to get over the peak as soon as we could and get out of there.' Mr Campbell and his pace-setter Aaron Heidt were caught in the storm at the summit of Handies Peak, pictured . Having survived the lightning strike virtually unscathed, both men ran on through the night, and the rain, with Mr Campbell eventually coming in third, having covered the course in 25 hours, 56 minutes and 36 seconds. As he reached the finish line he grabbed a bear, drinking part and pouring the rest over his head, before proclaiming: 'Wow, that was a hard race.'","Adam Campbell and Aaron Heidt were running the Hardrock 100 in Colorado .

"By . Damien Gayle . An owl who was hit in the head by shrapnel near border between Israel and Gaza is recovering after it was rescued by a passing vet. The long-eared owl from Kibbutz Nirim, just over the border from the heavily bombarded Gaza town of Khan Yunis, where hundreds have been killed, was knocked off its perch by a fragment of mortar shrapnel. Veterinary student Ben Itay found the wounded owl and took him home, but as the kibbutz was under fire he could not get it to proper vet's facilities. When he was able, he took the owl to colleagues at the Ramat Gan Safari park for treatment. Kocked from its perch: X-rays of the rescued owl show where the mortar shrapnel is lodged inside its head . The bird was x-rayed and found to have metal fragments in its head as well as injuries to its right eye and beak. It is now being treated and vets hope it will no lose sight in its injured eye. Meanwhile, in Gaza, Israeli forces shelled a UN Relief Works Agency school sheltering Palestinians displaced by the invasion, killing at least 15 people and wounding dozens more. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said he was 'appalled' by the attack on a building where hundreds had taken refuge after they were told to leave their homes by the Israeli army. In three weeks since Israel launched its latest offensive against the besieged territory, a total of nearly 750 people have been killed. More than 100,000 have sought sanctuary in UN facilities in Gaza. Israel has lost 32 soldiers since it launched its ground invasion, which followed nearly two weeks of aerial bombardment aimed at stopping militants from firing rockets at Israeli cities. Esti, a keeper at the Ramat Gan Safari Park, with the owl: The bird was x-rayed and found to have metal fragments in its head as well as injuries to its right eye and beak, but vets hope it will now recover . 'Today’s attack underscores the imperative for the killing to stop – and to stop now,' Mr. Ban declared. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, civilians in Gaza have no safe place to go with 44 per cent of the land declared a ‘no-go zone’ by the Israeli army. UNRWA facilities are only slightly safer. At least 18 medical facilities, include five UNRWA health clinics have been hit by airstrikes and shelling.","The owl is from Kibbutz Nirim, just across the border from Khan Yunis, Gaza .

"By . Damien Gayle . A runaway dog who disappeared for nearly two months and lost a leg after he was hit by a car has been reunited with his owner. After a seven-week search, Beagle-mix TJ was found by Animal Control officers in Boulder, Colorado, when locals reported a dog that had been hit by a car. As officers prepared to take the four-year-old dog to the vet, they scanned him and discovered he had a microchip which linked him to Dave Snyder of Fort Collins, a 55-mile drive away. Beagle-mix TJ was found by Animal Control officers in Boulder, Colorado, when locals reported a stray dog that had been hit by a car, seven weeks after he went missing in Fort Collins, some 50 miles away . TJ is now recovering at home after his right hind leg was amputated. He is expected to need further surgery to stabilise his front right leg, the Coloradoan reported. 'He's now a tripod. But he's in good spirits.' Mr Synder told Sarah Jane Kyle, who covers volunteerism, nonprofits and philanthropy for the paper. TJ and Mr Snyder had been together less than a year when the dog ran away from a dog sitter in City Park on May 14. Distraught, Mr Snyder had posted flyers and notified authorities and the local Humane Society. He even hired a private search team to look for TJ. TJ spent the first two years of his life in a cage as a research beagle in Wyoming before he was rehabilitated and put up for adoption, and is still mistrustful of people, said his owner Dave Snyder, 27 . For weeks after, he was getting calls from people saying they'd seen his dog, and even spotted the errant pet himself in LaPorte, but TJ proved elusive and efforts to catch him failed. Mr Snyder told Boulder Police the sightings stopped on June 8 and after that he believed the dog had been hit by a car or killed by another animal. Boulder Animal Control began getting calls about a dog-at-large about three weeks ago, said Boulder Police. Officers tried to catch the dog several times, even setting a trap, but without success. They finally caught up with TJ last Wednesday after residents reported he'd been hit by a car. He was badly hurt and needed urgent veterinary treatment. Mr Snyder and TJ together after they were reunited. He has set up an online fundraising page for help getting together the expected $12,000 he needs to cover TJ's veterinary treatment bills . TJ spent the first two years of his life in a cage as a research beagle in Wyoming, Mr Snyder said, before he was rehabilitated and put up for adoption. 'He wasn't a normal little guy when we got him,' Mr Snyder told the Coloradoan. ""He didn't bark for over a year. He didn't know what to do with a yard."" Mr Snyder now faces an eye-watering $12,000 bill for TJ's treatment, after deciding putting the dog down 'just wasn't an option'.

"By . Damien Gayle . Danish Irfan, 22, battered his sleeping wife to death with a hammer, hitting her 10 times after finding an intimate text message she had sent to another man . A man has been jailed for life for smashing in his apparently unfaithful wife's skull with a claw hammer. Danish Irfan, 22, from Pakistan, hit his British-Asian wife Ridda Zanab’s skull so hard that fragments of bone penetrated her brain, killing her in minutes. He had pleaded guilty to manslaughter but today a jury took just two hours to find him guilty of murder following a trial at Bradford Crown Court. Sentencing Irfan to life with a minimum term of 16 years, the Honourable Mr Justice Stuart-Smith said: 'Ridda survived for some minutes after the attack. We can only hope that her suffering was short.' 'Your expectations about how a wife should behave were expectations that Ridda could never meet,' the judge said of Bradford-born Ms Zanab. 'I accept the general thrust of your evidence, which is supported by other evidence in the case, that she was simply not a person who would be a stay-at-home wife whose entire existence was governed by deference to and . respect for her husband. 'That was because she was the person she was; and that was a person she was fully entitled to be. 'If you knew anything at all about her before your married you would have realised that and it shows a staggering naivety on your part that you thought she would change.' The jury was told that Irfan's attack, which involved at least 10 blows as his wife lay asleep in bed, came after he discovered a message she had sent to another man, which read: 'I luv yu, mwahhh, gud nyt.' The 21-year-old victim had only given birth to their daughter two months before her death. After the killing at their home in Bradford, West Yorkshire, on November 3 last year, Irfan changed his blood-stained clothing and took their baby in a taxi to the nearby home of Ms Zanab's mother and sister. He said he needed to leave the baby with them because he had to work, but instead he went to Manchester Airport where he unsuccessfully tried to get himself deported back to Pakistan because his student visa had expired. The jury heard that Irfan then made his way to London where he obtained a false passport and used it to fly to Islamabad from Heathrow. Ridda Zanab, 21, who the court heard had a Westernised outlook on life, had only given birth to the couple's daughter two months before her death . The judge told Irfan that he had shown real remorse and a degree of courage in returning to face justice when he could have stayed on the run in Pakistan. In the family's victim impact statement Ridda's sister Saima Parveen said the family could not believe that she had been taken from them in such dreadful circumstances. The court heard that Irfan did not like his wife going to work or wearing western clothes . 'We often talk as a family about how we are all going to explain everything to Ridda's daughter Aleena in a few years,' said Ms Parveen. 'We can't even imagine what we will say and will never be ready for the questions that she may want answering. 'We are so happy she is a girl as it's a constant reminder for us and she is a piece of Ridda for our family to treasure for the rest of our lives. 'Aleena has the same eyes as her mum and the same lovely smile of her mum.' Irfan and Ms Zanab met and married in Huddersfield in 2012, but he claimed that within weeks of the ceremony his new wife was staying out late and using cannabis. The couple moved to Bradford when Ms Zanab became pregnant. But two months after the baby girl was born, Irfan killed his wife. The jury heard allegations that the business management student, who came to the UK on student visa, was 'possessive and controlling.' Outlining the case to the jury last week, prosecutor Jonathan Sharp said Irfan and his wife were from very different backgrounds. He said Ms Zanab had been born in Bradford and had a Westernised outlook on life. 'She liked a night out and she had a rebellious streak to her,' said Mr Sharp. The court heard she had a number of boyfriends before meeting Irfan when she was just 19 and he had only been in the country for six or seven months. 'By all accounts he did not share Ridda’s pleasure in going out,' said Mr Sharp. 'Ridda’s family did not approve of him and their relationship was kept partly secret. When they got married no family members were invited.' Bradford Crown Court heard that by late October Ms Zanab had come to the conclusion she was no longer going to be a loyal wife and in the days leading up to her death developed a relationship with another man . Speaking after sentencing, Detective Superintendent Mark Ridley, of West Yorkshire Police's Protective Services Department, said: 'Irfan brutally murdered his wife in the family home in Bradford and then fled to Pakistan in a bid to evade capture. 'Following work with the international authorities, we were able to secure his voluntary return to the country to face justice. 'He has today found guilty of murdering Ridda Zanab and has been sentenced accordingly. 'Our sympathies remain with Ridda's family and especially her young daughter, who will sadly grow up without her mother.'","A jury found Danish Irfan, 22, guilty of murdering Ridda Zanab, 21 .

Nearby neighbourhoods shook as the Innerbelt Bridge's remaining skeleton of steel girders collapsed after more than 50 years of holding up the main artery into the north-east Ohio city. Nearly a thousand locals who had gathered at East 14th Street and Broadway to watch the demolition cheered as the landmark was obliterated in a millisecond. Scroll down for video . Demolition engineers take a last look at the Innerbelt Bridge before blowing it up . Someone presses the magic buttons and charges detonate at 88 crucial spots around the steel frame . With its weight-bearing joints destroyed, the bridge begins to collapse . A cloud of dust is kicked up as, after 55 years, the massive bridge collapses onto the ground below . The 55-year-old bridge, which had aged faster than expected, is to be replaced with two new bridges, the first of which has already been built and the second of which is due for completion in 2016. At around 6am on Saturday morning, engineers pressed the button to detonate 182lbs of explosives placed at 88 crucial spots which, in half a second, sent the remaining 5,000 tons of tumbling to the ground below. Shortly before, a smaller 'scare charge' had been let off to scatter any peregrine falcons or other birds roosting in the superstructure. The spans on each end of the bridge, and over the Norfolk Southern railway and Cuyahoga River, which couldn't be blown up, had already been manually dismantled, leaving five of the nine spans for explosive demolition. The Innerbelt Bridge had carried Interstate-90 traffic in and out of downtown Cleveland since 1959. It was taken out of use last November, with traffic transferred onto the first of the dual bridges that will replace it, which are named after retired Ohio senator George Voinovich. Baltimore firm Controlled Demolition handled the razing of Innerbelt Bridge. Its president, Mark Loizeaux, told Cleveland.com's Alison Grant that for him it was 'just another day at the office'.","The Innerbelt Bridge carried traffic into downtown Cleveland since 1959 .

"By . Snejana Farberov . and Damien Gayle . The former long-time girlfriend of a Utah man sentenced to life in prison for murdering a police officer has spoken out for the first time since the verdict, saying that she forgives him for shooting her in the back. Timothy Troy Walker pleaded guilty Tuesday . to aggravated murder in the slaying of Sergeant Derek Johnson, 32, and . was immediately sentenced to life without a possibility of parole. In her first jailhouse interview with Deseret News, Traci Lee Vaillancourt, 35, read a lengthy letter she penned to Walker, the father of her 6-year-old daughter and her partner of more than 20 years. The woman said she and Timothy met at age 12 and have been inseparable until that fateful night last September when her meth-addict boyfriend shot dead Sgt Derek Johnson during a traffic stop. Finding closure: Traci Vaillancourt, 35, pictured in court in September 2013, wrote a letter to her ex-boyfriend Troy Walker telling him she has forgiven him for nearly killing her, but not for murdering a police officer . 'We may never know why you did what you did,' the former model wrote. 'For me, I've stopped asking why and just accepted it, because even if I knew, it doesn't excuse it. It doesn't lessen the hurt. It doesn't make any sense.' Vaillancourt admitted that she still loves Walker and continues to pray for him despite everything he had done to her. 'I forgive you for the years of physical, mental and emotional abuse. I forgive you for putting the bullet in my back that almost took my life,' the jailed mother of one wrote. Behind bars: Timothy Walker was sentenced to life in prison with no possibility of parole after pleading guilty to the murder of police Sergeant Derek Johnson . But Traci added that it is not her role to forgive her ex-boyfriend for the murder. Vaillancourt, a one-time model, suffered a series of strokes that have left her severely disfigured. In her letter, she said Walker took advantage of her health crisis instead of helping her fight for her life. Even . though she described her 22-year relationship with 'Troy' Walker as a . 'mess,' she noted that she could have never imagined that he would . become homicidal. Traci . Vaillancourt, who is facing obstruction of justice charges, also . eulogized Sgt Johnson, saying that Draper City lost one of its finest . men. She apologized to the . slain officer's family, including his parents, wife and young son, . saying that she prays for them every night in jail. Looking . ahead, the 35-year-old woman said she has learned a lot from her . experience and now feels stronger without Walker by her side. But . Vaillancourt also wrote that she is terrified that her daughter, who . is currently living with Walker's mother, will reject her. She concluded her missive with the words: 'I’m so scared Troy. You promised we would always be together. I love you.' When . asked if she would like to see her ex-boyfriend in person, the jailed . woman replied that she wants nothing to do with him anymore. But in the next breath Vaillancourt said that Walker will forever be a part of her life because of their daughter. Different look: Vaillancourt had been a model (pictured) before an illness left her disfigured . The family of Sgt Johnson had considered asking prosecutors to push for a death sentence for Walker, but said they were happy with the penalty handed to his killer Tuesday. Randy Johnson, Sergeant Johnson's father, told KUTV: 'Today the streets are safer, because the man that shot Derek is now off the streets and can't hurt anyone else.' Walker, 34, had been by the sitting in a broken down Volvo by the side of the road with his girlfriend, Traci, when Sgt Johnson had pulled over to check on them September 1, 2013. Johnson had not even stepped out of his patrol car when Walker shot him in the right side of his torso with a 9mm Glock pistol. The bullet pierced several of his organs, including his heart, KUTV reported. Walker continued to fire as Johnson drove away, the court heard. Critically injured, the policeman eventually veered off the road and smashed into a tree. He later died in a hospital. Torturous relationship: Vaillancourt wrote that she met Walker at age 12, and the two have been together for over two decades . Walker then turned the gun on Vaillancourt, shooting her in the back, before trying to kill himself with a bullet to the head. He missed and the bullet ended up going through his jaw and mouth. Vaillancourt was left with a bullet lodged in her sternum. She still faces two counts of obstruction of justice after allegedly lying to officers investigating Johnson's death. she is due back in court next Tuesday. As well as the aggravated murder of Sgt Johnson, Walker also pleaded guilty to the attempted murder of Vaillancourt, three counts of third-degree felony discharge of a firearm, and third degree felony possession or use of a firearm by a restricted person. He apologized to the court for his actions. Sergeant Johnson was married to his high school sweetheart Shante Sidwell with whom he had a six-year-old son, Bensen. Sergeant Johnson, who had stopped to check on Walker and his girlfriend Traci Vaillancourt, had not even stepped out of his car when Walker shot him. The father-of-one is pictured right with his son Bensen . Walker continued to fire as the Sergeant Walker drove away, the court heard. Critically injured, the policeman eventually veered off the road and smashed into a tree. He later died in hospital . Speaking last year in response to the crime, Vaillancourt's sister Victoria King revealed her sister's downward spiral from aspiring model and TV star to drug-addled homeless woman reliant on her violent boyfriend. After having her first child, Vaillancourt was diagnosed with a rare blood disorder called Hereditary Angioedema which made her face, throat and limbs swell, her sister said. She says her sister quickly became addicted to her pain medication after suffering four strokes before the age of 30. 'It just went downhill from there,' Ms King told KSL.com last year. 'I tried to get him away from her. She chose a different path. … He was bad news from the get-go, I knew it, and the two of them combined, and a loaded gun nonetheless, and strung out on drugs.' 'We tried and tried and tried to help her but you can't help someone who won't help themself,' she added. Ms King last saw her sister and Walker the day before the shootings and was left startled by his behavior. 'He got out of the car and he was hyper, showing me a gun that has a laser and a machete and knives,' she said. Walker then turned the gun on Vaillancourt, left, shooting her in the back, before trying to kill himself with a bullet to the head. He missed and the bullet ended up going through his jaw and mouth, right . The couple were trying to talk King into giving them cash - an event which wasn't unusual according to Vaillancourt's older sister. Ms King told Salt Lake Tribune that her sister was not without remorse at what had become of her life but couldn't work her way out of the cycle of addiction. 'She would cry, ""I never pictured my life turning out like this"",' Ms King told the newspaper. Vaillancourt, pictured right in an old family photo, had slipped into a downward spiral from aspiring model and TV star to drug-addled homeless woman reliant on her violent boyfriend before the killing happened . According to Ms King, Walker gave Vaillancourt attention and Vaillancourt 'was attached to him at the hip'. She says the pair had been living in and out of motels and, at the time of Sergeant Walker's murder, were living out of their car. She says the couple told her they needed protection and that's why they had purchased a cache of weapons. 'I know she was a victim, but I felt like I already lost her a long time ago. My heart is absolutely bleeding for Derek Johnson’s family,' Ms King added in the interview. 'I just want them to know I’m sorry'. After Tuesday's sentencing, Mr Johnson, Sergeant Johnson's father, said: 'There's a finality in this that was very difficult to deal with, but there's also comfort that we're reaching to that point where we can say, ""Yes, we can now move forward.""

"By . Damien Gayle . In March last year, photographer Sebastiano Tomada ventured to Aleppo, Syria, the centre of the revolt against President Bashar al-Assad, to photograph the fighters there. What he found astonished the world. In the midst of this brutal civil war in the heart of the Muslim Middle East, an entirely female detachment of fighters who had taken up arms against the regime. The photographs he sent back made headlines across the West. And now, nearly a year-and-a-half later, his work has been recognised with a gold medal from the Prix de la Photographie Paris. Left is Amal, 30, a married housewife with three children. Right, Benifet Ikhla, 27, a widow with six children . Left, Om Faraj, a housewife aged 30 with no children. Right, Ali, 16 years old, a student . Left, Rana, a 20-year-old student. Right, Khansa, 42, a married housewife with seven children . Left, Om Ahmad, 72, a housewife with three children. Right, Fadwa, a 20-year-old widow with three children . Mr Tomada met the fighters, some of whom were with their children, in a secret command post inside Aleppo. Many of them had been compelled to fight by injustices and humiliations dealt out by the regime and its henchmen. One of them, Om Ahmad, a 72-year-old mother-of-three, told him how she had fled wit her to Aleppo after her home in Dara'a was destroyed by bombers. 'I chose to pick up a weapon and fight the regime,' she said. For another woman among them, Benifet Ikhla, a 27-year-old widowed by the fighting, her motivation was equality for women. 'I fight for life and freedom, I fight to prove that woman and man are equal,' she said. A third, Fadwa, a widowed mother-of-three aged just 20, was more nihilistic. She said: 'My husband died on the front lines, I will die on the front lines, may God help us.' At the time around 150 women had joined the katiba - which means battalion or phalanx in Arabic - and according to a monitoring group they were playing a key role in the fierce fighting around the city.

At the time around 150 women had joined the katiba - which means battalion or phalanx in Arabic - and according to a monitoring group they were playing a key role in the fierce fighting around the city . In those days of spring 2013, Syrian rebels - many of whom came from rural areas around Aleppo - had seized control of large parts of the city and the regime was on the back foot. It looked as if the regime was defeated in the city, despite having broad support among residents. But the lack of unity among the disparate rebel battalions, who ranged from the largely secular Free Syrian Army - with whom the women were aligned - to the outwardly Islamist al-Nusra front, made organised defence difficult. When the regime, backed by fighters from the Lebanese militant group Hezbullah, launched its counter-attack in late March, splits among the rebel groups became difficult to paper over, while atrocities committed by some eroded their public support. Last month the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that as many as 7,000 people have been killed in rebel infighting since January alone, including some 650 civilians caught in the crossfire. Now as Syrian Army special forces make a fresh push on Aleppo, control of the city is again in the balance, with reports that rebel positions are under siege, their supply lines to Turkey in the north cut off. There is no fresh news of the FSA's all-female unit, but their memory lives on.","Sebastiano Tomada's photos won a medal from Prix de la Photographie Paris .

"By . Damien Gayle . A Palestinian man was arrested today in connection with the murders of three Israeli teenagers as warplanes hammered 10 targets in Gaza. Soldiers swooped on a home just after midnight in the West Bank city of Hebron, where Israeli forces have concentrated their search for the killers. The arrest came after protests over the apparent revenge killing of a Palestinian teenager spread yesterday from Jerusalem to Arab towns in northern Israel. Scroll down for video . An Israeli military vehicle patrols the West bank city of Hebron this morning, around the same time that soldiers arrested a Palestinian man in connection with the murders of three Jewish teenagers killed near the city . The man arrested in connection with the murder of the Jewish teenagers was identified by his family as Hossam Dufesh, the Associated Press reports. The Israeli Defence Force would not elaborate on the arrest . An American teenager - the cousin of the murdered Palestinian boy - who was beaten and detained by police during the protests in east Jerusalem was today brought before an Israeli court. Overnight, Israeli airstrikes targeted what the Israelis claimed were rocket launchers and a weapons workshop in the Gaza Strip, after 29 rockets and mortars were fired into Israeli territory. Relations between Israel and Palestine have been tense since Eyal Yifrach, 19, and 16-year-olds Gilad Shaar and Naftali Frenkel were abducted on June 12, leading to a massive Israeli military operation in Palestinian areas. They were later found dead in a shallow grave, a discovery quickly followed by the the apparent revenge killing of a Palestinian boy, Mohammed Abu Khdeir, who was snatched from his home in East Jerusalem. His burned body was found in a forest. Palestinian officials said a post-mortem indicated the 16-year old had been burned alive. Israeli police say they are still investigating the killing of Mohammed Abu Khdeir, but Palestinians say Israeli extremists murdered him to avenge the deaths of the three Israelis. The three Israeli seminary students (from L-R) Naftali Fraenkel, 16, who also holds U.S. citizenship, Gil-Ad Shaer, 16, and Eyal Yifrah, 19, whose killings have sparked the current round of violence . The man arrested in connection with the murder of the Jewish teenagers was identified by his family as Hossam Dufesh, the Associated Press reports. His arrest came as violence spread from Jerusalem to Arab communities across northern Israel, with with hundreds of people throwing rocks and fire bombs at police who responded with tear gas and stun grenades. Police spokeswoman Luba Samri said police had arrested 22 Israeli Arabs. Unlike Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Israeli Arabs hold citizenship rights, but still face discrimination from the 'Jewish State'. Even so, violent riots like those that occurred yesterday are rare. Clashes had mostly subsided by early this morning, but the situation remained tense. U.S. citizen Tariq Abu Khdeir, left, 15, was beaten by police when he was arrested on Thursday after a protest over the murder of his cousin, Mohammed Abu Khdeir, 16, right, became a violent clash with Israeli police . Police today asked a Jerusalem court to extend the detention of 15-year-old U.S. citizen Tariq Abu Khdeir, who was badly beaten by police during the clashes. He is the cousin of murdered Palestinian teenager Mohammed Abu Khdeir. His parents say their son, who goes to school in Florida, was the last person with Mohammed shortly before he was snatched. They said Tariq left Mohammed to eat before the Ramadan fast began at dawn Wednesday, and Mohammed was seized shortly afterward. The feared Israeli border police charge at Israeli Arab protesters during clashes in Ar'Ara, northern Israel . Police said Tariq Abu Khdeir resisted arrest, attacked officers, and was captured with a slingshot for lobbing stones. Abu Khdeir's face was masked in a keffiyeh, an Arab headscarf that some Palestinian protesters wore during the clashes to conceal their identity, police added. He was detained along with six other protesters, police said, including some armed with knives, adding that several officers were hurt in that specific protest, one of many that day. Amateur video of what Tariq's father Salah said was the beating aired on a local television station, and he said he could recognize his son from his clothing. Pictures of the boy taken after his arrest showed his face badly swollen. The U.S. State Department said it was 'profoundly troubled' by reports of his beating and demanded an investigation. Israel's Justice Ministry quickly launched a formal investigation.","Palestinian held after police swoop on his home in West Bank City of Hebron .

"By . Damien Gayle . A Russian Orthodox priest has found a novel way of overcoming his nation's pain at their early exit from the World Cup. Alexander Shumsky has denounced the tournament as a 'homosexual abomination', because players' brightly coloured boots lined up bear a resemblance to the 'gay rainbow'. 'Wearing pink or blue shoes, [the players] might as well wear women's panties or a bra,' wrote Father Shumsky in his column on Christian website Russian People's Line. 'They might as well wear women's panties': Russian priest Alexander Shumsky was irked by football boots . The Moscow Times reports that Father Shumsky was also cross with the 'unthinkable' hairstyles worn by some of the players in Brazil. The outspoken priest's intervention comes after Russia's manager Fabio Capello was called before the Duma - Russia's parliament - to explain the national team's dismal showing. But hilarious as it might seem to foreign eyes, it comes amid an atmosphere of extreme homophobia in Russia, where gay people have been publicly targeted by vigilantes and a law was recently passed banning 'gay propaganda'. For Father Shumsky, Russia's awful showing and early exit was a welcome respite from the garish festival of football, which he sees as a challenge to the piety of Russians. 'The liberal ideology of globalism clearly wants to oppose Christianity with football. I'm sure of it,' he wrote. 'Therefore I am glad that the Russian players have failed and, by the grace of God, no longer participate in this homosexual abomination.' 'Homosexual abomination': The hairstyles of some of the tournament's players also annoyed the holy man . Despite the priest's pronouncements, it seems that many in Russia are not so pleased that their boys have returned home from Brazil so early. The head of the Duma's Sports Committee, Igor Anansikh, last week said he wanted Capello to tell lawmakers how he intends to improve the Russian side and make them more competitive. Russia failed to win a game in Brazil - drawing 1-1 with both Algeria and South Korea, as well as losing 1-0 to Belgium - and finished third, leading to a group stage exit.","Alexander Shumsky said brightly coloured boots are like the 'gay rainbow'

Rolling Stone Ronnie Wood may soon  be doing his bit for breast cancer, as new daughter-in-law Fearne Cotton calls in a few family favours for her annual charity music festival, Festifeel. Profits go to breast charity Coppafeel,  which aims to take the fear out of breast self-examination. ‘So many women are scared to check their boobs because they don’t know what they will find, which is silly when you are more likely to be saved if you find something early,’ Fearne said. Famous friends: Fearne Cotton has said she will be calling in a few family favours for her annual breast cancer charity festival Festifeel . The success of previous one-day Festifeels – this year’s was a sellout – has given Fearne the confidence to think big and she wants the event to become a much larger affair, complete with top-name headliners. Kasabian and McFly should also expect calls from the presenter – both bands were at her wedding to Ronnie’s son Jesse in June. ‘I want it to be as big as Glastonbury,  with camping and everything,’ Fearne said last week. So will the Stones be playing? ‘Let’s just say I’m going to call in a lot of favours,’ she said. Who y'gonna call? Fearne might be ringing up her father-in-law Ronnie Wood, left, or Mcfly's lead singer Tom Fletcher, right, ahead of next year's Festifeel . Good news for the long-of-limb: tall . people are less likely to suffer asthma and acute heart disease. And . extra height makes women, specifically, less prone to depression and . anxiety. Research, based on 28,000 people aged 25 to 79, showed that . healthy women were on average 2.5cm taller than those who reported bad . health. In men, the difference was 4cm.

The first medically approved sun lotion has been launched, with the aim of reducing the number of Britons developing skin cancer. Actinica has been licensed as a medical device after extensive hospital trials. It  was found that its use reduced by half the risk of developing a non-melanoma skin cancer, the majority of skin  cancer seen in Britain. Actinica contains photostable UV filters  and protects skin from UVA and UVB rays. Your own finances may be a source of stress – but neighbours’ money worries could also damage your health. A new study found that people living within 100 yards of a home that was being repossessed tended to have higher blood pressure – and that it rose further for every extra repossessed property within the same radius. The survey by University of Illinois researchers involved 1,740 people living in Massachusetts between 1987 and 2008. Poor air quality may increase the risk of dementia. The dramatic effect on mental decline of those in more polluted areas was equivalent to being up to three years older, say researchers from the University of Southern California medical school. Air that contains small or fine particle pollution is especially harmful because once inhaled, particles can travel through the circulation system and damage the heart, lungs and brain. Dr Jennifer Weuve, of Rush University in Chicago, says: ‘If this is a cause, it can be modified using regulatory intervention.’ Overweight people don’t see the dangers of their condition in images of others like them. In a study in Bath, nearly 600 people were shown messages about the dangers of being overweight, with a photo of an overweight model, a morbidly obese person, or no photo. Overweight peope who viewed the morbidly obese image perceived risks to start at a far higher weight than those who saw no picture.","Fearne Cotton's annual music festival raises money for Coppafeel .

"By . Damien Gayle . A supermarket shelf stacker who tried to stop a child urinating in the aisles had a heart attack when his mother reacted with a 30-minute tirade of abuse.

Causing a scene: This woman was so incensed at a supermarket worker who stopped her soon urinating in the fruit aisle she launched into a tirade that went on until the shelf stacker had a suspected heart attack . She reportedly shouted: 'How dare you, children need to be able to relieve themselves wherever they want. Everyone knows that they can't hold it in and it's unhealthy.' When Ms Chen's colleagues came over and tried to calm the woman down she became even more enraged, continuing to scream and shout even when the manager turned up. Reports claimed that the woman continued her diatribe for 30 minutes, even after both the manager and his staff had been browbeaten into offering profuse apologies. She only stopped when Ms Chen collapsed clutching her chest and was rushed to hospital with a suspected heart attack. The shopping mall in Liaoning Province, north-west China: Incredibly, managers finally apologised to the woman and sent her packing with vouchers and a bag of free fruit for having dared cross her little emperor . Shoppers who witnessed the incredible outburst took photographs as she confronted workers. Wen Su, 42, posted her images online. She said: 'Despite the apology it didn't placate her and she only stopped when one of the staff members clutched her chest and fell on the floor. 'The woman's husband who stood quietly behind her saying nothing during the incident left with his wife and son after the ambulance arrived.

Fears: The army chief said the skies above the Arena Amazonia were closed during the England game this evening. Pictured are fans arriving at the stadium ahead of the match surrounded by security . Counter-terrorism units are stationed at arenas across Brazil but are not visible to fans. Security was stepped up following a series of riots in the city on Thursday. Demonstrators had been protesting throughout the day against money spent on the tournament in Brazil. Some threw rocks at the ITV studio - with the pundits, led by host Adrian Chiles, later saying they thought they were being shot at. On Saturday, the BBC was forced to issue an urgent security warning to its World Cup staff after four youths tried to mug a TV worker outside his hotel. The victim, described as a ‘consultant’, was surrounded by the gang three minutes after leaving the ITV studios on Copacabana Beach, but bravely fought them off after a scuffle. It happened as he passed the gates of Girl From Ipanema park, named after the famous song, at 7pm last Sunday. The location is believed to be close to where Gary Lineker is staying. Strong defence: Lineker posted this picture of police surrounding the ITV studios on Saturday . The former footballer tweeted a picture of riot police on Saturday lined up outside the BBC studios, writing: ‘Best defence on show this evening, right outside.’ Tighter security checks were promised at World Cup stadiums after Chile fans let off fireworks when their team sealed victory over Australia.

Chile fans lit fireworks, sending plumes of smoke across the Arena Pantanal pitch, after Jean Beausejour scored in stoppage time of a 3-1 win. FIFA bans fireworks and flares from stadiums and requires tournament organizers to enforce security checks to prevent fans smuggling them in.

"By . Australian Associated Press . David Jones boss Paul Zahra has quit the department store chain and will be replaced by Country Road head Ian Nairn. The move comes just weeks after South African retailer Woolworths finalised its $2.2 billion takeover of David Jones, Australia's oldest department store, and took full ownership of the Country Road retail chain. Woolworths said Mr Zahra, who has held the title of CEO at David Jones for the last four years, had resigned with immediate effect, but would stay on for three months to hand over to Mr Nairn. The CEO of David Jones, Paul Zahra, has announced he will resign from his position only weeks after South African retailer Woolworths finalised its $2.2 billion takeover of the department store . 'Mr Zahra has indicated that this would be the best time for a change of leadership in the company and having established a sound base for future growth, would like to move on to new challenges,' the company said in a statement on Tuesday. He will be replaced within the next three months, by the current head of Country Road, Ian Nairn . It's not the first time Mr Zahra has announced his resignation however, with the CEO claiming he was stepping down for 'personal reasons' in October last year. His departure was delayed when David Jones' chairman and two other board members resigned in February this year, forcing MR Zahra to stay on. Mr Zahra took on the position of CEO from the former boss of David Jones, Mark McInnes, who resigned suddenly in 2010 after being accused of sexually harassing Kristy Fraser-Kirk, a David Jones publicist at the time. Mr Nairn has three decades of experience in specialty fashion and department stores in Australia and overseas. He had run Witchery before Country Road bought it in 2012. Woolworths has appointed Witchery's current boss, Matt Keogh, as the new head of Country Road. Woolworths head Ian Moir said Mr Zahra had provided David Jones with a strong platform for growth. 'The new management team will complement the existing skills and expertise at David Jones to create a strong, innovative and fashion-centric business,' he said. David Jones is Australia's oldest department store, originally opening shop on George Street in Sydney in May of 1838 . 'David Jones is an iconic Australian business with great traditions and values and we look forward to taking it to the next level.' Mr Zahra said David Jones' strong financial performance in the past year had helped create a natural exit point for him from Australia's oldest department store. 'It has been a privilege to be the steward of such an iconic Australian brand with an extraordinary team of people,' he said. Woolworths took control of David Jones in July after shareholders accepted a $2.2 billion takeover offer.

Matthew Symonds, 34, was found at the Biffa waste depot in Avonmouth, Bristol, on Friday morning. Police believe he may have been transported 45 miles in a recycling bin from his home town of Swindon. Grim: The body parts of Matthew Symonds, 34, were discovered at a recycling plant in Bristol . Wiltshire Police's senior . investigating officer Detective Chief Inspector Gareth Bevan said . officers were still keeping an open mind with the investigation. He . said: 'Police enquiries so far suggest the body was transported with . commercial recycling waste collected in Swindon and therefore the focus . of the investigation will be in that area going forward. 'The . investigation is at an early stage and we are keeping an open mind . about the circumstances leading to his death. Our thoughts are with his . family and friends at this very difficult time.' According to neighbours Mr Symonds was being pursued by drug dealers in the past. Shocking: Staff at Avonmouth recycling plant in Bristol were horrified to find human remains among the waste . Investigation: Police arrived at the depot at 11am yesterday morning and immediately seized the site . A man described how someone came to . his door by mistake and told his girlfriend he would 'stab up' Mr . Symonds because of an unpaid debt. Mr Symonds' own Facebook page revealed he had just recently been released from prison halfway through an eight-month sentence. At Booth House, the Salvation Army's base in the centre of Swindon, staff referred enquiries about Mr Symonds to local police. One . resident at the site recognised Mr Symonds as someone who had been . staying there as recently as the weekend of July 26 and 27. Suspicions: The dismembered body may have been thrown into a recycling bin in Swindon, Wiltshire, police say . Enquiries: Police are now working to identify the victim and determine how long ago the body was discarded . He said: 'He was a nice enough guy, normal and chatty. He seemed pretty sociable. 'He had just come out of Bullingdon (Prison). I think it was for shop thefts, something like that - nothing violent.'Mr Symonds' entries on Facebook include comments indicating his grief at losing his mother, Madeline Leadbetter, who died last year. He indicated that he had found her dead on the morning of September 9, two days after he was released from jail after serving six weeks of a 12-week sentence. His comments also show Nazi sympathisings. As well as a drawing of a Second World War German soldier, with a swastika behind him, on March 19 this year he ranted: 'I dont give a f*** about no 1 except my self and family any more.heil f***ing hitler.' On the same day he wrote: 'sieg hail.hail hitler' (sic). It is not the first time a body has been found a waste depot in Avonmouth. In 2012, Canadian student Garrett Elsey was found at the New Earth Solutions Site, which is also in Bristol. The 22-year-old - who had been out drinking while celebrating his first night in the UK - fell asleep in a wheelie bin before it was emptied hours later. An inquest later heard Mr Elsey was crushed to death in the back of the bin lorry.","Remains of Matthew Symonds were found at Avonmouth waste site .

Prime minister Tony Abbott will travel to the Netherlands on Sunday where he will meet with Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, before being briefed on the ongoing identification of the victims of Malaysia Airlines flight 17. The Dutch government has issued a brief statement announcing Mr Abbott's will visit The Hague on Monday and sign a condolence book. 'Over the past few weeks, the Netherlands and Australia have been working together closely to repatriate and identify all the victims as soon as possible,' the statement said. Prime minister Tony Abbott, pictured here at the national memorial service for victims of MH17 on Friday, will arrive in the Netherlands on Monday to be briefed on the recent developments of the tragedy . 'Following the meeting (with Mr Rutte), Prime Minister Abbott will sign the book of condolence for the Dutch victims of the disaster.' Earlier on Friday, it was revealed forensic experts working in Hilversum in the Netherlands had identified a further 21 victims of flight MH17. Only two bodies had previously been identified, both Dutch nationals. The 21 additional victims comprise 16 Dutch, including a dual British national, two Malaysians, a German, a Canadian and a Briton. The search for body parts at the crash site in eastern Ukraine has been suspended due to escalating clashes between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russia separatists. 'To date it has been a daily challenge to keep working without interruption. The experts wore protective vests for their own safety and regularly heard shooting in the vicinity of the search area,' a statement from the head of the recovery mission, Pieter-Jaap Aalbersberg, on Wednesday said. The search for body parts at the crash site has been suspended due to escalating clashes between Ukrainian and pro-Russia forces (Pictured: members of the repatriation mission being greeted by Dutch officials and Australian police at Eindhoven on Friday) It went on to say that the team called on local residents to hand in any personal belongings of the victims that they had collected and share any further information. 'There are a total of 10 one-cubic-meter packages filled with personal belongings. These include items of great significance to the victims' loved ones, such as photo albums, cameras, jewelry, diaries, passports and cuddly toys,' Mr Aalbersberg said. In a statement released on the same day, Prime minister Rutte said: 'In 2 or 3 weeks we hope to be able to reveal how many bodies have been recovered in total.' 'Seven hundred DNA samples have been taken and are currently being analysed. Once that process is complete, we will know how many victims have been brought back to Hilversum.' Two military transporters arrived in the southern Dutch city of Eindhoven on Friday carrying 142 police experts from the Netherlands, Australia and Malaysia. On Thursday, Mr Abbott attended a national day of mourning service in Melbourne, where he told passengers' relatives: 'You have not been abandoned and you never will be.'","Mr Abbott is expected to arrive at the Hague in the Netherlands on Monday .

"By . Associated Press . and Australian Associated Press . The surrogate mother at the centre of the controversy surrounding a baby boy who was allegedly abandoned by his Australian parents after they found out he had Down syndrome may face charges in Thailand. Thai medical authorities are threatening to take action against Pattaramon Janbua, 21, as the Ministry of Public Health and other agencies crack down on medical institutions and clinics linked to the commercial surrogacy the ministry calls 'illegal'. Thai reports said the ministry was also considering charges against Ms Pattaramon who is a food stall seller from the southern province of Sri Racha. Scroll down for video . Thai medical authorities have threatened Pattaramon Janbua with legal action and charges after she allegedly carried the children of an Australian couple . The ministry says the fact that Ms Pattaramon received payment of $16,000 as the surrogate mother of Gammy and his twin sister was in contravention of Thailand's human trafficking laws. The Bunbury couple, David and Wendy Farnell - from Western Australia - have denied they abandoned the baby boy and returned to Australia with his healthy twin sister. The couple claims Ms Pattaramon 'misled' the world over the events that led to them leaving the baby behind in Thailand. But on Tuesday the Thai woman denied this had happened. Ms Pattaramon was paid a total of $16,000 to be the surrogate mother of Gammy, seven months old, who was then allegedly abandoned by David and Wendy Farnell . 'I have never lied or hidden anything. The truth is the truth; it's up to society to make their own judgment,' Ms Pattaramon told Agence France Press (AFP). It has also been reported Gammy's Australian father was a convicted paedophile. 'Personally, when I heard the news I was shocked but I can't say anything much right now,' Ms Pattaramon said at a press conference in her hometown, adding she would 'leave it to the law' to see if she could get the girl back. But despite the threat of the Thai law working against Ms Pattaramon in her home country, it could be the exact opposite here in Australia. Professor Jenni Millbank, a surrogacy law expert at Sydney's University of Technology, said Ms Pattaramon could seek custody of the daughter through the Australian courts. 'She's a legal parent. If she turned up in the Family Court tomorrow, she could seek the return of that child, if that's what she wanted,' Millbank told Nine News. Meanwhile, seven-month-old baby Gammy is receiving treatment at a Bangkok hospital, where he is being treated for a congenital heart condition. A spokesman for the hospital said the baby was now receiving specialist care and is 'in safe hands'. It is alleged the Western Australian couple abandoned Gammy to his fate after they found out he had Down syndrome and a congenital heart condition . Initially David and Wendy Farnell told the Nine network they had no knowledge of the other child, but a statement released on Tuesday said they were told of the baby's existence but that it had a congenital heart condition and was not expected to live. The case has spurred widespread debate, putting Thailand under the spotlight because of its weak legal framework overseeing surrogacy and in vitro-fertilisation (IVF) laws. Thai law firm Chaniwat and Leeds, which says it will cover surrogacy and IVF cases on its website, warns of possible 'complicated legal issues'. 'While surrogacy in Thailand is currently an option and a rapidly-growing area of medical innovation, there are a number of legal considerations prospective parents should consider,' the firm told AAP. The lawyers said Thailand currently has no laws or published case decisions directly relating to the practice of surrogacy, 'and in essence surrogacy is neither legal nor illegal in Thailand'. Agencies and health clinics openly engage in locating surrogate mothers and egg donors. 'Thailand's Medical Council has taken a cautious approach to the practices of IVF implantation, egg donation, and surrogacy; these practices are still in a legal and medical ""grey area"",' the firm said. Investigations are now under way by Thailand's Bureau of Sanatorium and Art in Healing under the Department of Health Service Support (HSS) into the surrogacy service clinics. There are reported to be an estimated 20 surrogacy agencies, most said to be foreign-owned drawing in an estimated $133 million annually.","Pattaramon Janbua may face charges in Thailand, medical authorities say .

"By . Australian Associated Press . Twiggy Forrest's proposal would effectively dictate what people on the dole can and cannot buy . Millions of welfare recipients could be told what they can and can't buy if the federal government accepts a new plan. A proposal to roll out income management to all 2.5 million people on working-age welfare - including disability support pensioners and carers - is reportedly contained in a review led by mining magnate Andrew Forrest. Mr Forrest wants all welfare recipients including non-indigenous Australians to be included in the the scheme. Only age pensioners and veterans would be exempt. Welfare management already applies in the Northern Territory and is being trialled in parts of NSW, Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia. Mr Forrest also wants all families receiving family tax benefits to have the payments directly linked to their children's school attendance, The Australian said on Thursday. He believes technology exists that would make it possible to ban the purchase of certain products, including alcohol and cigarettes, with the value of quarantined welfare payments added to bank-controlled cards, known as healthy welfare cards. A spokesman for the parliamentary secretary guiding the review, Alan Tudge, said the government would be releasing the 'comprehensive and ambitious' report into indigenous welfare and employment shortly. The Australian Greens called on the government to reject Mr Forrest's recommendations, even though they haven't seen his report. Ramping up income management was a 'deeply alarming suggestion', senator Rachel Siewert said in a statement. The recommendations were highly punitive and reflected the top-down policy approach of the past that had consistently failed to deliver meaningful results, she said.","Forrest proposes income management scheme to federal government .

"By . Australian Associated Press . Michael Newman's son died of head injuries in the 2012 crash in Caversham . A father whose dangerous driving in an illegally modified car caused the death of his three-year-old son demonstrated negligence and a lack of responsibility, a Perth judge says. Michael Brian Newman was driving with two other adults and his son Dre, who was in a booster seat in the rear of the vehicle, when he lost control and crashed into a tree in Caversham in May 2012. The boy died from head injuries. Newman pleaded guilty on the first day of his trial last month to a charge of dangerous driving causing death. During sentencing submissions in the Perth District Court on Tuesday, his lawyer said Newman was 'extremely remorseful' and pleaded for 'mercy' and a spent conviction. But the prosecution argued an immediate term of imprisonment was appropriate. The court heard a $200 modification to the Holden Commodore, which caused both rear wheels to turn at the same speed, made the car unroadworthy and dangerous. Newman changed from third to second gear and then accelerated, causing the rear wheels to lose traction with the road and spin before hitting the tree, the court heard. Michael Brian Newman lost control and crashed into a tree in 2012, killing his three-year-old boy . Judge John Wisbey said Newman 'didn't give proper thought to the consequences' of having mechanics fit the spool, and it amounted to a 'serious level of negligence' and a lack of responsibility. He said the victim impact statement from the child's mother depicted the obvious devastation a mother would feel under such circumstances. The court heard Newman, who wept throughout the proceedings, had made two attempts on his life since the incident and was plagued by nightmares. Newman had his bail extended until his sentencing on Wednesday.","Michael Brian Newman lost control and crashed into a tree in 2012 .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . It's common knowledge that medication can cause unwanted side effects, from headaches to rashes and cramps. But one woman got more than she bargained for when trying to ease her symptoms of Parkinson's - up to five spontaneous orgasms a day. The 42-year-old had been diagnosed with an early-onset form of the disease,  triggered by a lack of the chemical dopamine in the brain. Seven days after being prescribed the drug rasagiline, the woman began suffering hyperarousal . Like many Parkinson's patients, she was prescribed the drug rasagiline which increases dopamine levels, therefore helping to relieve symptoms such as tremor, stiffness and slow movement. Well-known side effects include headache, flu-like symptoms, feeling dizzy, constipation and dry mouth. But after seven days, the Turkish woman began experiencing rather more unusual ones - hyperarousal and increased libido, LiveScience reports. This was triggering three to five orgasms a day, lasting between five and 20 seconds each time. By the 10th day, the woman was so distressed, she was admitted to hospital. In a case report, to be published in the journal Parkinsonism and Related Disorders, the doctors who treated her wrote: 'To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of this adverse effect of rasagiline.' Why the spontaneous orgasms occurred isn't clear - but one theory is the raised levels of dopamine that rasagiline causes . The woman had not been taking any other medication, and she did . not experience any other bizarre symptoms related to the use of the . drug, according to the report from the medics at the department of neurology at Necmettin Erbakan University in Konya, Turkey. When she stopped taking the drug, the symptoms stopped. But the orgasms began again 15 days later when she resumed the course, forcing her to  abandon it. It's not clear why the spontaneous orgasms occurred - but one theory is the raised levels of dopamine that rasagiline causes. This is because dopamine is a neurotransmitter that activates the body's reaction to sexual pleasure, the researchers say. In their case report, they mention another bizarre case concerning the drug - a man who suffered from spontaneous ejaculation. The episodes continued even when the dose of rasagiline dropped by half, but stopped when the 65-year-old ceased taking the drug. He also reported a better sex life when he did want to have intercourse, according to the report in the journal Movement Disorders.","42-year-old Turkish woman had been prescribed the drug rasagiline .

"By . Steph Cockroft for MailOnline . and Gemma Mullin . A 26-year-old mother and her 22-month-old son have been found dead by police after a suspected murder-suicide incident nine months after going missing. It is thought that Angel Hudson, 26, known locally as Katie, killed toddler Arthur Hudson-Cardy and then took her own life at their home in Chorley, Lancashire. Miss Hudson, who originally lived in Teignmouth, Devon, went missing from her home in November 2013 and was believed to have moved to Spain. Angel Hudson pictured with her 22-month-old son Arthur Hudson-Cardy . Police issued an appeal after family members were concerned they were unable to contact her. It is not yet known whether officers from Devon and Cornwall Police ever traced the pair, who had since moved to an address in Euxton, Chorley. The house where the pair died was owned by Miss Hudson's great aunt Mary Linley. Neighbours said Miss Linley, who died a spinster, often spoke of her grand niece Katie. However, when Miss Hudson arrived in Lancashire, she called herself Sam Stone. Neighbour Christine Thom said: 'I always knew her as Sam or Samantha and her little boy was called Arthur. She was very nice and she would come over on occasions. ‘She only moved in in January when Mary died. 'She never told me her personal circumstances. I just knew her as Sam, it was her Great Aunty’s home and Mary used to talk about Katie and I didn’t think any more of it. I had been looking after Mary because she was poorly after she died, Sam was at the funeral. Her father John came up for a day or two but I don’t know where he went back to. I honestly knew nothing about Sam.' A teddy bear and a bunch of floors reading 'So Sad :( RIP xxx' were left outside the home. One neighbour described the mother as 'a really lovely lady' Floral tributes have been left outside the home where the mother and son were found. Detectives said it was a 'tragic case' and that inquiries were still being carried out . Ms Thom continued: 'She seemed very happy, very confident and knew what she wanted. She didn’t give the appearance of being scared of anything. The garden was beautiful. She was having it landscaped. She had all the plans for the back garden. I knew nothing about her. The car would always go straight back in the garage. 'I didn’t see her much but she came over one day with the little boy and he played in the garden, it was general chit chat. 'It was a habit the blinds would be open in the morning, sometimes quite early but on Tuesday everything was closed and that was unusual. I kept coming to look across the road and I was getting worried. 'My Neighbour said he was going to call me too I rang her landline and sent her a text message but there was no reply. I couldn’t get any response. We both walked to the garage and we could see the silhouette of the car in the garage. 'I called her dad John. He was in Birmingham driving up. I think he thought it was for a friendly chat. I expressed concern and said I hadn’t seen her for a couple of days. He rang me back. He tried to contact her and told me to ring the police. 'He said she’d been depressed at the weekend. I don’t think people can believe it - especially when we didn’t know what her real name was. Maybe she was running away from something and changed everything. It’s a mystery and just so sad.' A police cordon has been put in place across the house in which the bodies were found while police carry out an investigation . Ron Charnley, 82, another neighbour said: 'There didn’t seem anything at all to be worried about. I would see her pop out in the car and walk down here. She was very slim and tall and quite attractive. She was no shrinking violet. I believe her dad lived out of the area and he used to come up now and again when Mary lived here. 'We heard all the commotion. There were two paramedics cars, an ambulance, two police cars and a police van. I’ve lived here 38 years and it’s always been a very nice estate. 'When Mary died Sam moved in. She’s had a lot of work done on the house. It seemed very much like she was preparing for the future. she wasn’t selling. As far as we were concerned she was there for life. I believe her dad is a spiritualist. Involved in the church.' Mr Charnley’s wife Doreen said: 'I’m flabbergasted by the whole thing. Things like that don’t happen around here.' Another neighbour said: 'People knew she was from Devon but all thought she was called Sam. We never knew she was called Angel. We’re totally baffled as to why that might be.' Angel Hudson, 26, who was known locally as Katie was found dead alongside her son Arthur yesterday . Detectives are treating the case as a murder inquiry but say they are not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths. Floral tributes and a blue teddy bear have been left outside the semi-detatched property in the quiet suburban close. Next door neighbour Graham Aspinall, 57, who has lived on the street for nine years, said: 'I've never seen anything like this happen here before. 'She only moved in next door at the beginning of the year but she was always incredibly pleasant. 'She always had her little boy with her and I'd often see her going out an about. Builders came in to do some work when she first moved in and she sent me a card to apologise for the noise. 'She was always very considerate and seemed like a lovely lady. It's an absolute tragedy to see something like this happen to a young woman and a little baby.' Another neighbour, Mr Higham, said: 'She was a really lovely lady, she always smiled and waved if you saw her in the street. 'She hadn't lived there very long. All of her family were down south. Her dad would come up every month or so just to make sure she was OK. 'She always seemed really pleasant and even in the last few days she seemed fine.' Another neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'It's a real tragedy and I feel so sorry for their family. She hasn't lived here that long so I didn't know her. But it's a tragic thing to see on your doorstep.' Detective Superintendent Eddie Thistlethwaite, from Lancashire Constabulary, said: 'This is a tragic case. 'It is being treated as a murder inquiry, although we are not looking for anybody else in connection with this incident. 'We are still in the very early stages of this investigation but we are conducting a number of inquiries in order to establish the exact circumstances surrounding the deaths.'

But new research shows we're a nation embroiled in a health crisis, wilfully neglecting our wellbeing and expecting the already overburdened NHS to pick up the pieces. The study, which looks at the the average health of men and women in the UK, reveals some alarming statistics about our diet and lifestyle, dubbed by experts a 'ticking timebomb'. Scroll down for video . The UK National Health Report, from Beneden Healthcare, reveals the vast majority of us fail to follow basic health guidelines, leading to a population that is overweight, overtired, unfit, poorly nourished and dehydrated . The UK National Health Report reveals that the vast majority of us fail to follow seven out of eight basic health guidelines, leading to a population that is overweight, overtired, unfit, poorly nourished and dehydrated. We're constantly being told that to be 'healthy'. We should eat five portions of fruit and veg a day, have a body mass index (BMI) of between 18 and 25, drink 1.5-2 litres of water a day and aim for seven hours of sleep a night. Smoking is obviously out, while men should drink no more than 21 units of alcohol a week and women 14, according to official Government guidelines. And when it comes to exercise, we should all be doing at least 150 minutes of (at least) moderate (if not high) intensity physical activity each week. But in reality, it seems things are very different, the report from Benenden Health shows. It was compiled after questioning 4,000 people across the UK to paint a portrait of . what Mr and Mrs Average look like from a health perspective. When . it comes to men, Mr Average eats 3.3 portions of his ‘5 a day’, has a . BMI of 26.2; only drinks 953ml (less than a litre) of water a day and . sleeps for 6.4 hours a night. Experts say we are aware of what we should be doing to maintain good health, but we deliberately ignore the guidelines set out for us . And it seems we aren't deluded - we know we are unhealthy - we just can't be bothered to do anything about it - most likely because we know the NHS is on hand to fix us, the report suggests . He also does just 73 minutes of cardio a week and 1.4 muscle strengthening work outs; smokes 3.8 cigarettes a day and and drinks 13.6 units of alcohol a week. Ms Average fares slightly better on the food front, managing 3.5 portions of her ‘5 a day’. However she too has a higher than average BMI of 25.9 and drinks even less water than her male counterpart: 896ml of water. She also sleeps for 6.5 hours a night, does 69 minutes of cardio a week and 1.1 muscle strengthening workouts. She smokes 3.3 cigarettes a day; and drinks 8.4 units of alcohol a week. Experts say we are aware of what we should be doing to maintain good health, but we deliberately ignore the guidelines set out for us. For example, despite failing to meet . the Department of Health's recommendations, the report reveals that the public knows it . should be eating ‘five a day'. Respondents aged 16-24 eat the fewest portions (2.9), while those aged 65-74 eat the most (4.1). The study, which looks at the health of the average health of men and women in the UK, reveals some alarming statistics about our diet and lifestyle, dubbed by experts a 'ticking timebomb' It seems we aren't deluded - we know we are unhealthy - we just can't be bothered to do anything about it - most likely because we know the NHS is on hand to fix us, the report suggests. When asked how . healthy they think the nation currently is, 71 per cent of respondents answered . either ‘not very healthy’ or ‘not at all healthy’. When asked the same . question about the nation’s health 50 years ago, only 29 per cent of respondents . answered negatively. The . report also explores the mental wellbeing of the nation and reveals . women fall victim to stress more than men (48 per cent and 35 per cent . respectively). They . are also more likely to have suffered from depression, anxiety and . insomnia and loneliness (on average around 40 per cent of women for each . condition compared with 30 per cent of men). The . different sexes also deal with stress differently. Both parties watch . TV to unwind, but women are more likely to read a book or have a bath. Instead, men are more likely to turn to alcohol. The . report also reveals the worrying statistic that Mr Average has a BMI of . 26.2 and Mrs Average has a BMI of 25.9. Both these figures indicate . someone who is overweight and at an increased risk of developing heart . disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes. BMI is your weight in kilograms divided by your height in metres squared. Using their BMI as a gauge, more than half the population (52.5 per cent) is . classified as either overweight or obese, with 6 per cent deemed . underweight. A total of 42 per cent of the population has a healthy BMI. Experts say that staying hydrated is also key to good health - and staving off hunger pangs. Those aged . 35-44 drink the most water (1 litre a day), and the over 85s drink the . least – on average, just 487mls a day. It is not a lack of . knowledge on the subject that leads to the nation drinking too little, as half of us know we should be drinking more. And . while Margaret Thatcher may only have needed four hours sleep a night, . it is widely accepted that 7-8 hours is the optimal amount of sleep . needed. However, . Mrs Average only manages 6.5 hours a night, while Mr Average has . slightly less (6.4). The report also explores the mental wellbeing of the nation and reveals women fall victim to stress more than men (48 per cent and 35 per cent respectively) The different sexes also deal with stress differently. Both parties watch TV to unwind, but women are more likely to read a book or have a bath. Instead, men are more likely to turn to alcohol . Those aged 16-24 get the . most sleep (7 hours a night on average), while those over 84 have the . least (5.5 hours). Commenting on the findings, medical . director of Benenden Health, Dr John Giles, said: 'At a time when modern . medicine is making consistent major breakthroughs to give us longer . lives and treat illnesses that even 20 years ago were fatal, the UK . population appears to be doing everything in its power to make those . extra years as unhealthy and miserable as possible. 'We cannot continually rely on the NHS . to pick up the pieces of our below average approach to looking after . ourselves: this laissez-faire approach is massively overburdening our . country’s health service. 'An ageing population and advances in medical science, alongside the surge in complex chronic illnesses, mean the NHS as it was originally conceived is becoming increasingly threatened.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The real estate developer accused of murdering his wife was having an affair with another woman, prosecutors said in court today, on the same day the medical examiner testified that strangulation by another person was the cause of death. The murder trial of Adam Kaufman, from Miami, resumed today with prosecutors introducing a motive for the murder of his wife Lina Kaufman, who he is accused of strangling to death. Kaufman claims his wife had a heart defect and that he woke up on November 7, 2007, and found her unconscious in the bathroom, with her neck draped over a magazine holder. Today: Adam Kaufman shook his head as prosecutors accused him of having an affair while his wife Lina was alive . Gone: Eleonora (Lina) Kaufman pictured here on her wedding day was found unconscious on the bathroom floor in November 2007 by her husband . He earlier blamed her death on an extreme allergic reaction to a spray tan she had done the day before for the first time. But Chief Medical examiner Dr Bruce Hyma returned to the stand today and testified that he was convinced 'to a medical certainty' that Lina Kaufman died from 'mechanical asphyxiation' applied by 'another person or persons'. He said the deep strangulation bruising on Lina Kaufman’s neck could not have been caused by the flimsy magazine holder. Earlier in the day, state Attorney Bill Baldwin told Judge Browyne Miller of Kaufman's alleged affair and his behavior soon after his wife's death: 'Here, he's asking this girl out with his dead wife's wedding ring on his finger, a month later. 'By January, February, they're having regular sex. He was not exactly devastated by his wife's passing. I mean, the best analogy I can think of is when Casey Anthony getting a tattoo.' The defense balked at the prosecution's allegations, according to Local 10.com. 'This takes the cake,' said attorney William Matthewman. 'What is the possible relevance of this testimony? There is none. 'There is absolutely no evidence of any impropriety during this marriage, any marital infidelity during this marriage, on either side. 'Adam is still wearing his wedding ring. He has to be forced to go out.' Emotional testimony: Rina Azulay said her friend was fit and healthy and never had any medical problems that she was aware of . Tears: Melissa Fedowitz wept as she described Lina as a 'one in a million, strong, happy, vibrant friend' The prosecution then admitted they had no evidence that Kaufman was unfaithful to his wife prior to her death. Two of Lina Kaufman's closest friends also told the court that she was a specimen of good health and never complained of shortness of breath or chest pains. Melissa Fedowitz wept as she described Lina as a 'one in a million, strong, happy, vibrant friend.' In the afternoon, Dr John Stollar, the emergency room physician who treated Lina when she got to hospital, told the court when asked what his preliminary diagnosis of how she died was. 'Perhaps she had a broken neck, perhaps she was strangled, perhaps she was hung,' he said. Last week, the Florida court listened to the dramatic 911 call made by Kaufman on the night of November 7. 'Oh my god - I don't know what is going on,' he is heard saying. 'I don't know what happened. She's on the floor dying. She's not breathing.' Fight: Mr Kaufman, left, with attorney Al Milian, in a Miami-Dade court during beginning arguments in his murder trial . The prosecution allege that the call occurred moments after Kaufman strangled his wife to death at their Aventura, Florida, home. Wiping tears away from his eyes as he sat in court, Kaufman watched as the prosecution showed the jury pictures of his wife's body covered in cuts and abrasions, which they said were not there hours before her death. The prosecution acknowledged that it took state medical examiners 18 months to issue a finding that Lina Kaufman's death was murder, but Mansfield said that was due to all possible alternatives being considered. Adam Kaufman, 39 (left) claims that he found his wife collapsed onto the magazine rack seen in the right picture in the couple's Aventura, Florida, home . The defense team for Kaufman told the jury that Lina Kaufman was cursed with fainting episodes and also had significant scarring on her heart, which could have been the cause of her collapse. They also concluded that the injuries to the mother-of-two's neck were the result of falling and hitting the magazine rack in the bathroom. 'This case is a tragedy of errors. An innocent man was charged with a non-existent crime, this is a prosecution in search of a crime,' said Matthewman. The prosecution is expected to wrap up its case tomorrow. Justice: Judge Bronwyn Miller listens to an attorney in opening arguments during Mr Kaufman's trial . Joseph Mansfield, Assistant State Attorney, (left) gives an opening argument in the trial of Adam Kaufman as Bill Matthewman, attorney for Adam Kaufman, (right) listens . The death of Lina Kaufman came to national prominence when her husband was charged with her murder in 2009, 18 months after her death and only when Kaufman complained to the medical examiner's office about the amount of time spent on the investigation. Appearing in court in 2009, the property developer's defense initially hinged around a spray tan the day before her death, Lina's first ever, which was claimed caused her to have a massive allergic reaction according to NBC Miami . However, the prosecution have been dismissive of this claim and that of Lina suffering from a bad heart. 'Under the laws of science, it's impossible to have happened either way the defendant suggested it happened,' said Mansfield. Together: Adam and Lina Kaufman pictured on vacation were said to have had a happy marriage . Opening the case by playing the distressing 911 call, Kaufman was heard hysterically screaming that his wife is not breathing. The prosecution alleged that the information Kaufman gave on the call was that of a calculating man beginning to cover his tracks. 'Lina had a bad heart,' countered defence attorney Bill Matthewman. 'You will hear no motive. No evidence of a motive whatsoever. 'No life insurance. No financial crimes. No affairs during the marriage on behalf of Adam or Lina. 'No neighbours heard any arguments.' Under house arrest with his two children since 2009, Kaufman is supported by his wife's family and her mother will testify to the court that her daughter 'suffered from seizures, from fainting, from headaches.' It was on November 6, 2007, that Eleonora 'Lina' Kaufman received her first even spray tan, went to see a girlfriend who looked at the work and noted at the time there were no bruises on her body. Then at 6am on November 7, a frantic sounding Kaufman phoned 911 to report his wife's death, in a phone call which lasted more than 15 minutes. 'Oh God! Oh God! Lina,' cried Kaufman as he was instructed to give his wife CPR. During the trial, the jury heard from Dr Tracy Baker, a plastic surgeon who had performed breast-implant surgery on Lina Kaufman. Not Guilty: Mr Kaufman was introduced by his defence team as a proud father and as a distraught widower . He told told the court that he knew Lina to be fit and to work out two to three times a week and that during his examination of her never found any heart symptoms. The court also heard from Larissa Adamyan, Lina's best friend who said that she had seen her friend have at least one fainting spell. 'She was dizzy, she called me. She was dizzy and on the floor,” said Adamyan according to CBS Miami . The police first became suspicious of Kaufman after one officer noted that his Mercedes-Benz was warm on the hood and was making clicking sounds as though it had just been driven when they arrived at his house on the night his wife died. Brother: Mr Kaufman turns to speak to his identical twin Seth during the trial in Miami . In addition, two firefighters who arrived at the scene told the court that it was suspicious to them that Kaufman was dressed and that only one side of the pair's bed appeared to have been slept in. The defense dismissed this as pure speculation and even went as far as to say that the emergency workers could have mistaken Kaufman's identical twin Seth, who lived down the street and had come to the house that night, for his brother. Lt Michael Castro reported that Kaufman told emergency workers that he found his wife slumped over a toilet like she had been vomiting. Vacation: In happier times Adam and Lina Kaufman are pictured on the beach near to their Florida home . The firefighter said that Kaufman changed his story at Aventura Hospital and said that he found his wife's neck resting on the magazine rack. He also added that he was wary of Kaufman's 'odd' behaviour that shifted from calm to angry. 'It was almost like an act,' said Castro. The defense have hired Dr Michael Bodden, the former medical examiner for New York City to debunk the prosecutions claims. 'The investigation underlying this case was biased, incompetent, flawed and inept,' said Matthewman. Currently free on bail of $500,000, Kaufam could be sentenced to life imprisonment if he is convicted.","Jury played distressing 911 call made by Adam Kaufman after allegedly finding his wife Lina collapsed in their bathroom .

But TasNetworks says that after widespread power outages in the south of the island many homes have had power restored. The damaging winds and heavy rainfall leading to flash flooding will continue to hit the state until Friday, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. Wind gusts up to 115km/h have been recorded in Devonport, King Island and Smithton, in the north.SES crews tended to dislodged roofs and fallen trees at properties between Latrobe and Circular Head. SES regional manager Wayne Richards urged Tasmanians to take care when outdoors in the extreme conditions, with the risk of airborne missiles and falling trees. He also urged residents hit hard by the storm to be patient, with the SES facing a steady stream of callouts from 7am. 'Emergency services and council resources are extremely busy dealing with the effects of the wind and rain and people should be patient when requesting assistance,' he said. Wild weather hit Tasmania with snow falling the south (at Hobart, pictured) and winds and flooding in the north leaving thousands of homes without power .

"By . Sally Lee . and Australian Associated Press . Australian police today admitted that it may be impossible to recover the bodies of all 298 victims as intense fighting forced international investigators back from the crash site for a second time. The delegation of Australian and Dutch police and forensic experts stopped in Shakhtarsk, a town around 20 miles from the fields where the aircraft was downed, amid sounds of explosions. A high-rise apartment block in the town was hit by at least two rounds of artillery, according to reports and dozens of families living in the area fled. Pro-Russian rebels admitted they had lost control of part of the crash site. Meanwhile in Canberra, Australian Federal Police deputy commissioner Andrew Colvin says there is a possibility they won't get to the crash site in the near future. Scroll down for video . Members of the Dutch and Australian forensic investigation teams stand near vehicles in Donetsk, Ukraine on Monday . Fighting around the Malaysia Airlines crash site in eastern Ukraine prevented Dutch and Australian police officers from reaching the wreckage for a second day . 'Of course it is a highly volatile area,' he said on Monday, adding that safety was paramount. Mr Colvin warned of the difficult circumstances the mission faces, including the size of the crash scene, trauma to the bodies of victims, and complications gaining access to the site almost two weeks after the Malaysia Airlines plane was brought down by a surface-to-air missile. 'We have to prepare ourselves for the possibility that not all remains will ultimately be recovered,' he said. The Dutch-led police mission will make a second attempt to gain access to the crash site in eastern Ukraine on Monday after it was forced to abandon a bid on Sunday because of intense fighting in the area.

The 49-person mission that includes 11 AFP officers is waiting for the go-ahead in the rebel-held city of Donetsk, about 60 kilometres away. Russian-backed separatists have agreed to allow an unarmed international police team to recover more bodies and start a forensic examination of wreckage. In all, some 170 unarmed AFP officers have been deployed in Ukraine as part of the recovery effort. A total of 298 people, including 37 Australian residents and citizens, were killed in the disaster. The development comes as UN human rights chief Navi Pillay said the downing of flight MH17 in eastern Ukraine may constitute a 'war crime'.

With government troops intensifying their push to claw back . more territory from pro-Russian separatist rebels, the death toll is mounting . steadily. Today rebels admitted they had lost control of part of the crash site to pro-Kiev forces. United Nations figures show more than 1,100 people have died in just . over four months of fighting. Ukraine has accused rebels of tampering with evidence and . trying to cover up their alleged role in bringing the Malaysia Airlines plane . down with an anti-aircraft missile. Separatist officials have staunchly denied responsibility . for shooting down the airliner and killing all 298 people on board. News that investigators were unable to reach the crash site for a second day comes as the UN said it was considering whether to classify the downing of MH17 as a war crime. Human rights chief Navi Pillay spoke out to say taking down to plane with a surface to air missile could constitute a war crime.

A Ukrainian security spokesman said data from the recovered flight recorders shows Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 crashed due to a massive, explosive loss of pressure after being punctured multiple times by shrapnel. Andrei Lysenko said the plane suffered 'massive explosive decompression' after it was hit by fragments he said came from a missile. The data recorders were sent to UK experts for examination. In their campaign to take control over more territory from separatist forces, Ukraine's army has deployed a growing amount of heavy weaponry. Rebels have also been able to secure large quantities of powerful weapons, much of which the United States and Ukraine maintain is being supplied by Russia. Moscow denies the claims. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a report that at least 1,129 people have been killed between mid-April, when fighting began, and July 26. The report said at least 3,442 people had been wounded and more than 100,000 people had left their homes. A UN report from mid-June put the death toll at 356.

Intensified combat operations 'are irrefutable evidence proving that Kiev is seeking to destroy all evidence of the crime committed by its military,' he alleged. 'The junta is in panic, the only thing that matters for them today is to evade exposure. 'Kiev's actions run counter to Poroshenko's decision to declare a 40-kilometre zone around the crash site a ceasefire territory.' Ukrainian military analyst Dmitry Tymchuk today alleged that rebels were sneaking back dressed as civilians into areas 'liberated' by the Ukrainian army. 'The activity of the enemy's sabotage groups is high,' he said.","Dutch and Australian investigators abandoned attempts reach crash site on Monday .

"By . Chris Leadbeater . You can never quite be sure what the sea will throw up. But if you happen to be a surfer who combines athletic feats on a board with a skilled touch in the studio, then any ocean detritus can be transformed into something dramatic. It came from the deep: Skeleton Sea create artworks with rubbish washed up on beaches - including the fragments of rubber used to create this tiger shark . Hugely inventive: The three artists have also created this giant fish using scraps of rusted metal - such as tin lids and compressed drinks cans . Artists João Parrinha, Luis de Dios and Xandi Kreuzeder – who collectively work as Skeleton Sea (www.skeletonsea.com) – have made a name for themselves through the sculptures and installations they make using items they find on beaches and in the waves. These shoes were made for... being recycled into an elaborate sculpture: Another of the art collective's concoctions was made using lost flip-flops . Taking on human form: Skeleton Sea have also created smaller artworks - including these human-esque figures fashioned from discarded rubber gloves . Surfers as much as they are creative types, the trio started out simply by collecting rubbish and washed-up materials they encountered while riding oceanic breakers – old lifebuoys separated from ships, shards of metal from wrecked vessels, scraps of rubber, chunks of wood, floating plastics and other myriad non-biodegradable substances. But they soon found that they could turn this unsightly trash into rather more beautiful objects – and make a pertinent point while doing so. Making a point: 'Roxy Mermaid' comes with an environmental message based upon the importance of keeping the oceans clean . Making the most of it: The artists are also surfers, and were inspired to begin creating sculptures using the detritus they found while boarding . By turning burst tyres, clusters of electric cables, dead car parts and strips of blackened metal into marine creatures such as life-sized sharks – complete with teeth and fins – they have been able to stress the importance of keeping the oceans free of pollution. Other creations have included giant fish constructed from can lids, soft-drink containers and lost flip-flops – and human figures shaped out of discarded rubber gloves. On display: The sculptures have been put on show in several parts of Europe, and were recently exhibited at Surfers Lodge Peniche, in Portugal . Rooftop view: Surfers Lodge sits in Peniche - a town that occupies a wave-lashed peninsula some 60 miles north of Lisbon on Portugal's Atlantic coast . ‘Roxy Mermaid’, meanwhile, sees an iconic female figure of oceanic legend perched, in multi-coloured fashion, on a large ball of abandoned fishing nets. It was devised by Kreuzeder from flotsam picked up on various beaches in Africa and south-east Asia. ‘The creative idea behind the work was to contrast the beauty of this well-known mythical being with the ugly truth that lurks beneath the surface of our oceans,’ he says. ‘Roxy Mermaid represents another way for us to spread the collective’s environmental message based around the importance of keeping our oceans clean.’ Odds and ends: Some of Skeleton Sea's creations have a macabre edge, including this skull constructed from, among other things, broken meshing and plastic bottles . Making faces: The exhibits drew a crowd when they went on display over Easter - and will return to Surfers Lodge Peniche for a second showing in September . The trio have exhibited their work in Spain – in Valencia, and in the Basque region in the north of the country – and in Biarritz, in western France.

"By . Caroline Mcguire For Mailonline . Britain's plus-size women feel so neglected by the country's high street stores that they have stopped following fashion, says a new poll. More than 10million women in the UK are now a size 16 or larger -  40 per cent of the population - the country's stores are still failing to cater for the them. It seems a foolish oversight, given the market is forecast to make over £6 billion in 2014. The survey, by Australian fashion . retailer Taking Shape, shows curvier women feels completely ignored by . most British fashion retailers. Plus size women now feel abandoned by the British high street, with many deciding to shop online or in supermarkets instead of facing the embarrassment of asking for help in stores . The poll also revealed the nation's favourite celebrity plus-size women, with . included Dawn French the most popular, raking in more than half of the vote, with . TOWIE'S Gemma Collins, Hollywood actress Melissa McCarthy and . ex-Emmerdale star Lisa Riley rounding up the top four. Some 90 per cent of women larger than a size 14 claim they feel unwanted by the high street, with two-thirds claiming the current plus-size range and sizes on offer are poor. Shoppers now feel so out of place in these shops that only one in 10 would even ask for help from a retail assistant, believing that the typically slim young women working in fashion stores are unable to relate to their needs. More than two-thirds are also avoiding the changing rooms in favour of their bedroom, because doors or curtains in the store changing room do not provide enough privacy. Despite some retailers like Debenhams catering for larger ladies, with bigger mannequins in store (pictured), 9 out of 10 plus size women believe their needs are completely ignored by UK shops . The range of clothing is so dire in many places that 93 per cent of women buy their new outfits with the main aim of covering up body parts, with a dismal 7 per cent paying any attention to fashion trends. And these attitudes are hitting the stores where it hurts most - the cash tills. Because shoppers are so embarrassed about being seen buying a new wardrobe, they are now heading in their droves to online stores or picking up items from supermarkets during the weekly grocery shop. One of plus-size women's major bug bears is lack of or size of curtains or doors in shop changing rooms, which is causing many women to avoid high street chains completely . The survey also showed up some interesting attitudes of plus size women to their bodies, with the majority labelling their stomachs as their worst asset, with breasts being seen as the best. Plus-size retailer Taking Shape undertook the survey in order to find out women's attitude to fashion for larger ladies. Comedian Dawn French came out top in the poll of favourite plus-size female celebrity, while Hollywood funny woman Melissa McCarthy was also in the top five . It has now opened 18 stores across the UK, with clothing offered in sizes 14 to 26, and is hoping to convince Brits to give shopping another chance. Alla Buinowicz, Managing Director of Taking Shape, said: 'I am staggered by this research. 'Millions of women in the UK have been left in the cold by the major high street chains and, unsurprisingly, they have abandoned shopping on the high street. 'These curvy British women feel unwanted and they are certainly unrepresented. 'So many British women have frankly given up on fashion. 'I want these ladies to come into one of my Taking Shape stores and rediscover their fashion mojo. 'All women should feel comfortable shopping for new clothes in store without dreading the experience.'","90% of plus size UK women feel unwanted by high street fashion shops .

"By . Associated Press . and Mail Online Reporter . Jason Brown, 24, is accused of dismembering several dogs and keeping their heads in a refrigerator while staying at a Nevada motel . A 24-year-old man is accused of killing and dismembering several dogs and keeping their heads in a small refrigerator while staying at a Nevada motel. Jason Brown is scheduled to appear at a status hearing Wednesday in Washoe District Court on animal torture and drug charges that could send him to prison for more than 20 years. Authorities say he was arrested July 9 after a maid called police when she found a decapitated dog in the bathtub of a room Brown was renting at the Super 8 Motel in Reno. Police say they found four dog heads inside a small refrigerator, and several bloody knives and scissors. Brown had reportedly been staying at the motel for a several days without letting cleaners into his room. His lawyer, John Oakes, tells the Reno Gazette-Journal the former Reno High . School student has 'mental health issues'. He says he may need a psychiatric evaluation before he goes to trial. It's believed Brown bought at least two of the dogs he killed off the listings website, Craigslist. The were reported to have been Chihuahuas. Kevin Schiller, Washoe County Regional Animal Services assistant manager and department head, said at the time of Brown's arrest: 'We haven't had any cases like this before. 'This is probably the second major case we've had dealing with animal abuse. 'They're not that common, at least at this level.' Police say they found four dog heads inside a small refrigerator, and several bloody implements inside Brown's room at the Super 8 Motel in Reno . Brown had reportedly been staying at the motel for a several days without letting cleaners into his room . If Brown had committed such acts before 2011 Reno police would have only been able to charge him with misdemeanors. However, the laws were changed after Raymond Rios adopted a dog from Craigslist and sliced the dog’s stomach open with a box cutter in a Reno motel leading to its death. This led to Cooney’s Law being passed, which allows police to charge people accused of animal cruelty with felony counts.","Jason Brown, 24, is accused of dismembering several dogs and keeping their heads in a refrigerator while staying at the Super 8 Motel in Nevada .

The Hollywood Reporter reports the studio is altering thousands of buttons worn by characters in the film because of they depict real buttons worn by the North Korean military meant to honor both Kim Jong Un and his late father Kim Jong Il. Scroll down for video . Sony Pictures seems to be taking North Korea's objections to the company's upcoming Seth Rogen-James Franco comedy seriously enough to begin altering the film . The nation would consider showing military decorations blasphemous. The studio is also considering cutting a scene in which Kim Jong Un's face is melted off in slow motion. However a source in touch with The Hollywood Reporter says the face-melting may be cut only because the filmmakers are still trying to decide whether they think it's funny, and not because of pressure from the rogue nation. The studio insists the alterations have nothing to do with concern over political fallout, they do come not long after statements out of Pyongyang showing anger over the film. The film's concept 'shows the desperation of the . U.S. government and American society,' for one. A source claims the hardware problem is made complicated by 'clearance issues' as the badges involve a living person.

A teenager was electrocuted and died in her sleep while she was charging her iPhone 4s. The 18-year-old, who has not been named, died in Xinjiang, on July 24. The deceased's sister said she smelt burning when she returned to their home and found her sister lying dead in her bedroom with burns across her body. A broken iPhone was next to her. It is not clear if the woman was using an authentic Apple charger, or a cheap counterfeit version which have been linked to other fatalities. Experts from the Forensic Science Association of China said the teenager had livor mortis across her neck, hands and leg, and concluded that she'd died from electrocution, the Shanghaiist reported. The teeanger's sister said online that the phone had been purchased in Urumqi and the retailer was now discussing compensating the family.

"By . Richard Shears . The aunt of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has mysteriously disappeared from a re-run of a  propaganda film, leading to speculation that she has been purged - or even executed. Kim Kyong-hui, 67, is the widow of Jang Song-taek, who was recently executed, and while it was believed she would always remain 'safe' under her nephew's brutal regime, analysts say that her disappearance from the documentary is ominous. Ms Kim was frequently seen at the side of her nephew and his wife at public events until January this year, when her last public appearance was in the documentary shown on North Korean Central TV. Gone: In the original film, above, Kim Kyong-hui could be seen but just a few months later the scene was replaced with one that didn't feature the widow . In that footage, aired in January, she was seen walking with the leader and his wife towards the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun in the capital, Pyongyang, to pay tribute to the embalmed bodies of former leaders Kil Il-sung and Kim Jong-il. Ms Kim's safety from purging or execution had always been assumed because she is the daughter of North Korean founder Kim Il-sun and the sister of the late leader, Kim Jong-il. Her role in recent times has been as Secretary for Organization of the Workers' Party of Korea. While she has been frequently seen close to Kim Jong-un at a number of public events, her apparent deliberate disappearance from a run-run of the original documentary suggests to observers that she might never be seen again. South Korea's Chosun Ilbo newspaper, which has good sources among North Korean watchers, reported that since the original screening featuring Ms Kim, a re-run shown on Tuesday depicts a scene in which only Kim Jong-un, his wife, and male military officials are visible. 'It seems that Kim Kyong-hui stepped down from major positions in the party, but we need additional verification to see whether she was ousted,' the paper quoted a Unification Ministry in Seoul as saying. Edited out: Kim Kyong-hui, left, is the widow of  party member Jang Song-taek, who was executed last year . Ms Kim was seen 'in the flesh' at a public concert in September last year and, while her name was later among top officials at a committee organizing the state funeral of a senior Workers' Party official, she did not make an appearance. That led to rumors that she had died or was seriously ill, but then she appeared in the first showing of the TV documentary in January. Despite her perceived protection as a direct descendant of nation founder Kim Il-sung, Ms Kim is still associated with a husband who was publicly denounced as a traitor and executed in December. After his execution, direct family members were said to have been shot dead and other relatives were sentenced to labor camps. Among those killed, reportedly on Kim Jong-un's orders, were North Korea's ambassadors to Cuba and Malaysia. The apparent 'disappearance' of Miss Kim has led to speculation that her place in high positions in the Workers' Party has been taken by Kim Jong-un's younger sister, Yo-jong.","Concerns widow may have suffered same fate as her husband who was executed last year .

"By . Steve Hopkins . A troupe of circus performers has been denied a business account after bank bosses branded their burlesque costumes - a 'moral problem' - even though they've got a no nudity policy. Entertainer Joshua Morris started ‘Circus Uncertainty’ earlier this year and applied for a business bank account with Santander so he could get grants to fund work with terminally-ill children. But he claims the banking giant denied his troupe an account because the showgirls’ burlesque-style outfits - a fringed bikini and stilts - were a 'moral problem'. Scroll down for video . Santander bank has been accused of not letting a Bristol-based circus troupe open a bank account because they had a 'moral problem' with the outfits above, worn by female show girls . Joshua Morris, seen here balancing Dan Price against his body and with fellow troupe member Lucy Maraschino, wanted to open a bank account so the circus troupe could apply for grants . The performers are baffled by the decision as there is no nudity in the family-friendly act - which has featured at Glastonbury and the Harbourside Festival. Mr Morris, an acrobat and juggler from Bristol, said: 'It has put all our plans on hold - we can’t move forward without it.' The 20-year-old said the company needed the account so they could apply for grants to run a program that would bring the favourite cartoon characters of terminally ill children in to see them. Mr Morris said his performers were far from X-rated. He said: 'We never offer anything that could cause upset. There is no nudity or anything like that. Burlesque-style shows are pretty mainstream now. The Whiteladies Road branch of Santander in Bristol which prevented the troupe from opening an account . 'I have spoken to friends in the circus industry and other burlesque acts too, and none of them have ever had an issue with a bank.' Mr Morris' problems began after he went into Bristol's Whiteladies Road branch of Santander and was questioned about his business, 'which seemed absolutely fine'. A week later he claims he was told on the phone he couldn’t bank with Santander because staff had looked on the circus’ website and didn’t like the look of costumes worn during some acts. Mr Morris said: 'She said we had been denied a bank account on the ground that we have a burlesque and a show girls act. The troupe have performed at Glastonbury and were a centre piece at the Harbourside Festival . 'She said someone higher up than her said because we sell burlesque and show girls acts we can’t have an account. 'She kept saying it was a ‘moral problem’ and that it was a ‘moral problem’ they can’t associate with the bank. 'We asked why that meant we couldn’t have an account and they didn’t offer an explanation, they just said no.' The outfit in question is a blue fringed bikini covered in jewels, worn with a feather boa and a headdress by female show girls who greet audiences before performing a burlesque act. Mr Morris said he couldn't understand why a bank was making a moral judgement, as his troupe were booked for a Lloyds party in September. A Santander spokesman would not comment on the reason why Mr Morris' was not allowed to open an account, but said it was 'happy to review' his application following some 'clarification of the nature of the business'. The spokesman said it was still in discussions with Mr Morris and hoped to reach a 'positive outcome' in the coming days. He said: 'We are very sorry for any concern or inconvenience that out initial misunderstanding may have caused.'","Troupe wanted account so they could put on shows for terminally-ill children .

The statement said: 'Nothing can fill the void she leaves in all our lives. 'We love and miss her so much.' This is not the first time a driver who has been involved in a fatality after having a seizure has escaped prosecution. In June 2012 Peter Murdoch killed his passenger Elizabeth Thompson when he suffered a seizure while driving and crashed into a wall in Bowness, Cumbria. Charges against Mr Murdoch were dropped after police discussed the matter with doctors and concluded Mr Murdoch wasn't in control of the vehicle at the time of the accident. Philip Chapman from Rayleigh, Essex, however, was jailed for six years for causing a death after crashing following a seizure. Linda Brooks died, and three others were seriously injured, after Mr Chapman crashed into four cars in Southend in September 2010. Police said Chapman was playing 'Russian roulette' with his condition and had not properly informedlicensing authorities about the extent of his condition. Epilepsy suffers are not legally allowed to drive if they have suffered a seizure during the last year which affects their consciousness and occurs while they are awake. Those with the condition are required to inform the Vehicle Licensing Agency about the full extent of their condition. In small amounts alcohol does not cause epileptic seizures. After three or four drinks the risk of a seizure is much higher. Withdrawal seizures are most common among those who have abused alcohol. They can occur in people with or without epilepsy, as they are prompted by the withdrawal of alcohol rather than the condition. Binge drinking can lead to status epilepticus - a life threatening problem. Alcoholism has been linked with the envelopment of epilepsy in some sufferers. Seizure medications can also lower alcohol tolerance.","Ian King arrested for death by careless driving but his case was dismissed .

"By . Steve Hopkins . More than £160,000 of taxpayers' money has been spent buying new televisions for the House Of Commons, it has emerged. According to official figures, more than 1,500 new televisions were purchased during the last financial year, an expense campaigners have slammed as a 'bad deal' for taxpayers. The Commons said the televisions were needed because of the digital switchover and will actually lead to savings. More than £160,000 has been spent buying 1,500 new televisions in the Houses of Parliament . The House of Commons said the televisions were needed so MPs and visitors could see what was happening in each of the Chambers . The details emerged following a Freedom of Information request by the Daily Mirror. A Commons spokesperson today said: 'Ensuring that workers and visitors on the Parliamentary Estate are aware of what is happening in each of the Chambers is essential to Parliamentary business. 'Parliament’s Annunciators use television screens to display this information live.' The spokesperson said because of the national digital switchover in 2012, and due to the age of the existing analogue screens, 'compatible digital screens' had been installed. The new televisions are expected to be cheaper to run, the spokesperson said: 'These screens are more energy efficient than the previous analogue models, and it is estimated that the switch will result in a reduction in maintenance costs of around £22,000 across the lifetime of the sets and £15,000 reduction in energy cost per annum.' Taxpayers' Alliance campaign manager Andy Silvester said: 'Hard-pressed taxpayers up and down the country will wonder why they're not being handed free TVs too. Around £36,000 had been spent replacing two panes of glass in the atrium at the £235million Portcullis House where fig trees have also been rented and maintained at a cost of more than £30,000 a year . 'This is a bad deal for taxpayers. There are plenty of ways for MPs to check what's going on in the Chamber for free, and this huge bill won't sit well with the public. The easiest and cheapest way would be for them to spend more time in the actual Chamber themselves.' The TV purchases follows revelations earlier this month that £36,000 had been spent replacing two panes of glass at the £235million Portcullis House. The money was used to repair the roof of the atrium in the building which is opposite the Houses of Parliament. And it comes as alcohol prices in the Commons have been frozen again - even though MPs' food and drink is already subsidised by millions of pounds a year. Taxpayers stump up £7million a year to keep restaurant and bar bills down in Parliament. In 2012 official figures showed that £32,500 a year was being spent on renting and maintaining evergreeen trees at Portcullis House. Since the exotic weeping fig trees were imported from Florida and planted in 2001, more than £400,000 has been spent on them.","Taxpayers' Alliance say £160,000 spend is a 'bad deal' for taxpayers .

"By . Steve Hopkins . Britain’s most senior criminal judge was left red-faced today when two convicted killers failed to turn up to court for sentencing hours after he granted them bail. Judge Brian Barker QC, The Recorder of London, allowed Lithuanians Valodia Tarasov, 35, and his younger brother Jurius Tarasov, 33, to remain free overnight. The pair were convicted of manslaughter at the Old Bailey yesterday along with their older sibling Viktoras, 39, over the death of Pawel Pacholak. Britain's most senior criminal judge, Brian Baker QC, bailed three brothers convicted over a man's death the night before they were to be sentenced and only one of them appeared in court the next day . Jurius Tarasov, 33, left, and his older brother Valodia, 35, failed to show up for sentencing after being bailed . But only Viktoras turned up be sentenced - forcing Judge Barker to issue a warrant for their arrest. Detectives believe the brothers are trying to return to eastern Europe. After issuing warrants for their arrests, the judge told the court: ‘I expect they will be caught reasonably quickly.' Viktoras was remanded in custody to be sentenced at a later date. Pawel Pacholak, 37, was attacked by the brothers, and later died, following a drinking session where he was accused of stealing one of their mobile phones . Police have issued an urgent request for information on the brothers and say anyone who sees them should dial 999. The Tarasovs killed Mr Pacholak, a 37 . year-old Polish man, after wrongly accusing him of stealing a mobile . phone during a drinking session. Jurius Tarasov had in fact left the . handset at a betting shop. Viktoras Tarasov, 39, the oldest of the three siblings, was the only one to turn up to court and has been remanded in custody to be sentenced at a later date . The brothers repeatedly attacked Mr Pacholak both outside and inside their flat in Streatham, south London, on 12 January last year. Mr Pacholak was so desperate to escape his attackers he locked himself in the bathroom before jumping or falling from the first floor window. Despite suffering a broken neck, Mr Pacholak managed to stagger a short distance before collapsing against a wall in Albert Carr Gardens. He was found dead by a passer-by several hours later at around 11.50am. A postmortem found Mr Pacholak had suffered multiple injuries to his head and face as well as 11 broken ribs. Prosecutor Aftab Jafferjee told the court: ‘The nature of this attack was sufficient to make Pawel Pacholak flee up the stairs, first to take refuge in the toilet and then in the adjacent bathroom where he locked himself in. ‘From that room such was his obvious and understandable fear that he either jumped or fell to his death in order to escape his pursuers.’ Jurius, of Stockwell, claimed he only pushed Mr Pacholak once while his brothers, both from Croyden, denied knowledge of any attack. They all denied the charge of manslaughter. The brothers were also convicted of perverting the course of justice.","Judge Brian Barker QC freed killer trio the night before sentencing .

"By . Steve Hopkins . Two men charged with detonating car bombs have been blindfolded and executed by rebel fighters in Syria. The men, reportedly charged by an Islamic religious court over setting off the explosives in the Idlib province, were killed in nearby Binnish in front of crowds of onlookers. Photos from the scene show the men kneeling on the ground as gun-toting rebels aim their rifles at them and discuss their fate. Scroll down for video .

The rebels appear to discuss the fate of the men, seen kneeling on the ground, as gunmen gather around them . The accused men anxiously await their fate while instructions are given to execute them . The men are then lined up next to a wall and half-a-dozen rebels fire at them with pistols and rifles - one even appears to film the executions on his mobile phone. The flurry of bullets stir up dust clouds which obscure their bloody bodies. The executions come amid news that Jihadists have killed at least 50 Syrian soldiers in ambush attacks. Meanwhile, Jordan's air force shot down an 'aerial target' near the Syrian border today - believed to have been a drone - a Jordanian military official said. It was not immediately clear where the object came from, but there have been reports of intense fighting in the southern Syrian province of Daraa that borders Jordan. The armed rebels point their guns at one of the accused men, as other armed rebels stand nearby . The blindfolded accused are forced to endure an agonizsng wait for their deaths . Crowds of onlookers seem impatient for the executions to take place, gesturing excitedly, and getting out their cameras, as rebels steady their guns . Syria's civil war, now in its fourth year, has often spilled across the country's borders. Also, extremists from the Islamic State group last month seized a huge chunk of territory straddling the Iraq-Syria border, declared a self-styled caliphate and imposed their harsh interpretation of Islam on the civilian population in the area. In Syria, members of the Islamic State fought government forces in different areas today, mostly in the country's north. Since their blitz offensive in Iraq in June, the Islamic State has increasingly taken on President Bashar Assad's forces in a push to seize as much of Syrian territory as possible. The aerial target was followed by Jordan's air force and shot down at dawn over an empty area in the province of Mafraq, said the Jordanian official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations. 'The armed forces will not allow any infringement of the country's security,' he said. According to eyewitnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity fearing for their safety, the drone was shot down near the Zaatari camp in Jordan, which is home to more than 120,000 Syrian refugees who fled the conflict at home. In April, Jordanian warplanes struck a convoy of vehicles as they were trying to enter Jordan from Syria. The Jordanian military said the aircraft destroyed the vehicles after firing warning shots. Jordan hosts nearly 600,000 registered Syrian refugees - although Jordanian officials say the real number is far higher. The kingdom has quietly supported Syria's rebels since the start of the uprising against Assad in 2011, and ordered Syria's ambassador out in May after accusing him of making ""offensive"" statements about Jordan.","The men were accused of setting off car bombs in the Idlib province .

"By . Steve Hopkins . A mother arrested over the death of her daughter who was found collapsed in her cot with a head injury told police she didn’t touch her 'baby girl', an inquest heard today. Summer Rogers-Ratcliffe died on February 28, 2012, a day after she was rushed to hospital with a 'non-accidental' head injury. Police arrested Summer’s mother Victoria Rogers, 27, stepfather Craig Sharp, 34, and grandmother Susan Rogers, 58, on suspicion of murder later that year because all three had looked after the toddler during the time she was injured. Victoria Rogers, pictured here with her daughter Summer Rogers-Ratcliffe, was arrested on suspicion of murdering her but was never charged, and today told an inquest she didn't touch her 'baby girl' The trio couldn't offer an explanation for the injuries or recall an accident that could have led to them and police eventually decided not to proceed with charges. Bradford Coroners Court today heard that Miss Rogers told police during an interview after her arrest that she didn't touch her daughter, and had given her a bottle at 5.30am before leaving for work. Summer - who suffered a 'blunt force head injury' and 'bruising to the brain' that would have required a significant impact - was pronounced dead in the early hours of the following day. Medical experts concluded the toddler received the fatal injuries close to the time she was found dying. Summer's grandmother, Susan Rogers, left, who discovered the toddler was unwell and began CPR, and her daughter, Miss Rogers, at the inquest into Summer's death at the Bradford Coroners Court . Speaking to police in September 2012, Miss Rogers, an ancillary nurse, said that as far as she was concerned Summer was 'fit and well' when she left the house. 'There’s nothing I want to say apart from I didn’t touch my baby girl, I gave her her bottle at 5.30am and I went to work,' she said. Miss Rogers added: 'Somebody got Summer up after I gave her that bottle, and somebody hurt her.' When asked if she did something to cause Summer’s injury after giving her the bottle, she replied 'I didn’t'. Summer with Craig Sharp who looked after her for two hours on the morning she was discovered injured . The inquest heard that Summer had not been feeling well in the days leading up to her death and had vomited on several occasions while staying with her grandparents over the weekend. After leaving her Dewsbury home at 5.45am on the day Summer was discovered injured, Miss Rogers left tyre garage manager Mr Sharp in charge. He then left for work at about 7.45am. Miss Roger's mother, Susan Rogers, then turned up to look after Summer and yesterday the inquest was told she checked on the toddler every 10 minutes before realising something was wrong with her about 8.30am. Miss Rogers, seen here with Summer, told the hearing 'there's nothing I want to say apart from I didn't hurt my baby girl', and claimed someone else had got her daughter up and had hurt her . The retired nurse found Summer was ‘not breathing and her head was floppy’. She immediately started CPR and phoned relatives for help. When paramedics arrived at the house at 8.54am, Summer was not breathing but had a pulse. She was rushed to hospital but died early the next day. Forensic pathologist Dr Mathew Lyall, who carried out a post mortem, said Summer suffered bleeding and swelling on the brain, and had bruises on her scalp – the classic ‘triad’  of injuries ‘strongly associated with non-accidental infantile head injuries’. During her police interview Miss Rogers said she didn't have any concerns about Mr Sharp's ability to look after Summer. The inquest had previously heard that Summer was a healthy and happy girl from a ‘loving family’. A statement read out in court from James Ratcliffe, Summer’s grandfather, said: 'Summer was a lovely girl and she brought new meaning to our lives.' The self-employed plumber added: 'She was a wonderful little girl and I loved her dearly.' The inquest continues.","Victoria Rogers said someone else got her daughter up and 'hurt her'
