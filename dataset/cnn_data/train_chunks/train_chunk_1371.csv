"A drama teacher has been jailed for just one year after fathering a child with his pupil during a sordid five-year  affair which began when she was a teenager. Married teacher Simon Parsons, 52, secretly had sex with the 17-year-old at the Castle School in Thornbury - where he had taught for 30 years - as well as at hotels and the home he shared with his wife and two children. The shocking affair - which was only revealed when the girl's family reported the teacher to the police years later - is the latest in a string of court cases to hit the headlines in recent weeks, involving illicit relationships between teachers and pupils. Drama teacher Simon Parsons, 52, was jailed today after having a five-year affair with a teenage pupil, who later fell pregnant with his child . Religious studies teacher Stuart Kerner (pictured left with wife Katherine), 44, and teaching assistant Andrew Tetley, 28, (right) were both spared jail despite being convicted of having sexual relations with pupils . Last week, religious studies teacher Stuart Kerner was spared jail, despite being convicted of two counts of sexual activity with a child after a judge controversially suggested the victim may have 'groomed him'. The father-of-one, who was vice principal at Bexleyheath Academy in south east London, had taken the 16-year-old's virginity in a store cupboard at the school in the same week his wife miscarried. It also emerged that his wife Katherine - an acting headteacher at a school in London - is standing by Kerner, prompting a wave of worried parents to withdraw their children from the school. And in another case, a teaching assistant was today spared jail for having an affair with a 15-year-old pupil, in which he groped the teenager by touching her breast and sent her explicit messages. Andrew Tetley, 28, who worked at a school in Lancashire, was handed a suspended sentence after the judge at Preston Crown Court accepted his claim that he believed the pupil was 16 - despite the fact he had access to records which would have confirmed her age. Experts today said that the deluge of cases was a reminder of the seriousness of teachers abusing their positions and that apparent ignorance of the law was no excuse. Sarah Green, acting director of End Violence Against Women Coalition, told MailOnline: 'These cases show how apparently ordinary teachers in ordinary schools have groomed girls and exploited their position of power. 'Offenders may try to tell themselves that what they have done was not serious but in fact the impact on those who are abused can last for many years.' Drama teacher Simon Parsons, 52, (pictured) had a long-term affair with a pupil and even had a child with the girl, but his wife is standing by him . Louise Pennington, member of the Everyday Victim Blaming Campaign, added: 'Realistically, relationships with pupils is all part of the training and the law is very very clear. 'Teachers are in a position of power and, for that, the age of consent is 18 - it is not 16 and has not been since 2003. We are looking at some 12 years since the law has changed so they really should know better. 'Of course, ignorance of the law is no excuse as all teachers know exactly what the law is. They know it is a criminal offence.' And Jon Brown, head of the NSPCC's sexual abuse programmes, said the charity was 'shocked and saddened' to hear about how the teaching staff had abused their position with vulnerable young people. In the case of Parsons, the court heard how the teacher first had sex with the girl - who cannot be named for legal reasons - during a birthday trip to London for her 17th birthday. The pair had met when the pupil was 13, but the relationship continued after she left the secondary school. Parsons, of Dursley, Gloucestershire, would see the girl at weekends, take her out for meals and the theatre and to his home. The court heard how Parsons’ wife 'bore' the affair and forgave her husband, who eventually returned to the family unit after the girl ended the relationship in her early 20s. In an email to Judge Neil Ford QC, the Recorder of Bristol, his wife said: 'He is not a monster, he is a gentle man who made a massive mistake.' Police only arrested the respected teacher after the girl’s family uncovered the identity of her child’s father and wanted to protect other pupils. The father-of-two later admitted five counts of sexual activity with a child in a position of trust. Defending, David Scutt said Parsons thought 'it was something that had been wanted and pursued'. But, in a statement read to the court, the girl, now a successful actress, said: 'I felt grossed out at one point and then I thought ""Oh well, he fancies me"".' During sentencing, Judge Ford told Parsons: 'You were a mature married man with a child of your own. She was your pupil living at home with her parents. 'You didn’t see the girl as a victim of unlawful or inappropriate behaviour but you now know that your behaviour has had a real impact upon her. 'I am sure that she is right when she describes the consequences of your actions as resulting in her feeling confused and lost. 'She said she was let down by a teacher whom she looked up to and trusted.' Preston Crown Court was told that Tetley, who had also touched the girl's breast, believed she was 16, despite having access to records which would have confirmed her age . Preston Crown Court was told that fitness fanatic Tetley had sent the girl photographs of himself topless . He added: 'Pupils from time to time will find themselves attracted to teachers. A teacher, of course, has a duty to ensure that he does not take advantage of that situation. 'It is important that the public appreciate that those who behave as you have will receive immediate custodial sentences.' The judge said sentencing guidelines offered him the opportunity to suspend a sentence of immediate custody. However, he handed Parsons the highest sentence the guidelines would allow, having reduced it following the teacher’s early admission of guilt. Parsons, who resigned as a teacher last year, was also banned from working with children and vulnerable people in the future. Inner London Crown Court was told that Kerner (pictured) took the then 16-year-old's virginity in a store cupboard the same week his wife miscarried and later had sex with her at his family home . Last week, Kerner's case caused outrage after he was handed an 18-month suspended sentence by Judge Joanna Greenberg QC at Inner London Crown Court. Kerner, of Ashford in Kent, had been convicted last month of two counts of sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust. But he walked free from court after the judge said it was clear his 16-year-old victim was 'obsessed' with him and 'pursued' him. Judge Joanna Greenberg QC told him: 'There is no evidence that you groomed her... It was she who groomed you and you gave in to temptation.' The Attorney General latter announced the case would be investigating following complaints of 'undue leniency'. The National Association for People Abused in Childhood had sent the ruling sent out 'the worst kind of message to abusers – or the best, if you are one'. Its chief executive, ex-teacher Pete Saunders, said: 'If you cross the line, if you go as far as sex as in this case, you have violated a child and deserve the consequences. “This perverse statement by the judge puts the responsibility for abuse, as this was, on to the victim.' In another twist in the controversial case, Mrs Kerner, acting head at Wyborne Primary School in Greenwich, has been placed on 'enforced leave' while council chiefs decide whether she should be allowed to continue working with children. She has always publicly backed her husband, attending each day of the trial and later calling the victim a 'liar'. Under the Childcare (Disqualification) Regulations 2009, a person can be banned from working with children aged under eight 'by association', if they live in the same household as another person who is disqualified lives or works. Meanwhile, today in Preston, the court heard how Tetley admitted sexual activity with a child as a person in a position of trust. He was handed a six-month jail term, suspended for two years by Judge Andrew Woolman, who said the background to the case meant it was 'unnecessary' to lock him up. The court was told the relationship came to light when the school's assistant headteacher heard rumours of a sexual relationship between the pair. Miss Worsley said that the girl explained her first contact with keep fit fanatic Tetley was via Instagram. She later told police she and Tetley had initially talked about her career prospects but she became sexually attracted to him due to his good looks. Miss Worsley said the pair exchanged telephone numbers and continued to speak and in interview the girl said that they had met up within a couple of days of making contact but knew 'it was wrong'. The court heard that the pair had met twice over three months when they had visited a pub, with both occasions initiated by the girl, who was just weeks away from her 16th birthday. During these meetings, they had talked and kissed, and on one occasion he had touched her breast. Miss Worsley said: 'She said it was proper kissing, with tongues, and she was happy with what he had done.' During a police interview, the girl said the pair had exchanged a series of explicit messages involving their sexual fantasies and where they could have sex. 'He asked for photos of her and there were very sexual conversations,' Miss Worsley added. Today, the mother and father of Parsons's victim said the fact he could no longer work with children brought them 'some closure'. 'Every parent sends their child to school where they expect them to be safe and to find out that school is the very place where your daughter is abused is a very horrifying ordeal for your daughter, and indeed all of your family, to have gone through,' her mother said. Her father added: 'It is obviously a significant sentence and gave a strong message.'","Simon Parsons, 52, was a drama teacher at Castle School, Thornbury .

"Samsung's next generation Galaxy handset could have a curved screen that covers both its sides. The handset, which is expected to have a 5.5inch screen, will come in a 'special edition' version with the curved technology, according to Sammobile. The Korean giant believes its curved technology could give it an edge over arch rival Apple. Scroll down for video . A Samsung Galaxy Note E, the first to use Samsung's curved screen. It is claimed the Galaxy S6 could come in a special edition with both sides featuring the technology. Previous leaks from BGR say the SM-G925F, the codename believed to be assigned to the Galaxy S6, will feature a Quad HD (2560 x 1440 resolution) 5.5inch display. It will also have an octa-core processor, Mali-T768 graphics processing unit, and a 16-megapixel rear-facing camera. The handset is expected to be unveiled at Mobile World Congress, a trade show in Barcelona, which takes place from 2-5 March. The handset is expected to be unveiled at Mobile World Congress, a trade show in Barcelona, which takes place from 2-5 March. 'Today, we can confirm that Samsung is indeed developing a Galaxy S6 with two-edge displays, one on each side, reports our source,' said the Sammobile site. The curved screen has already been used  in Samsung's Note Edge. However, S6 Edge will have the ability to work in a left or right handed mode . 'You will have an option to choose favourite contacts and an ability to assign specific colours to them,' explained Sammobile. 'So, calls and notifications from important people will show the designated color lighting on the edge area.' Samsung surprised audiences at the Berlin-based trade show IFA in September when it unveiled its curved device. The screen was described by Samsung's David Park at the event as working like a 'ticker', with notifications and news scrolling along it. The Galaxy Note Edge's unique curved touchscreen provides quick access to frequently used apps and alerts. The curved screen displays notifications at the top and bottom, while viewing a video without disruption, for example. Because the curved edge remains visible even if a flip-book style protective cover is used, it is easier to keep up-to-date with incoming calls and messages. Previous leaks from BGR say the SM-G925F — the codename believed to be assigned to the Galaxy S6 — will feature a Quad HD (2560 x 1440 resolution) display, octa-core processor, Mali-T768 graphics processing unit, and a 16-megapixel rear-facing camera. Earlier this month, in the face of stiff competition, and following a consecutive drop in profits, Samsung announced plans to curb the number of phones it makes each year. Instead of releasing handset after handset and saturating the market with Samsung devices, the firm has decided it needs to concentrate on making fewer handsets, better. The South Korean manufacturer is also expected to ramp up production of its remaining models so they can be sold more cheaply. In the face of stiff competition, and following a consecutive drop in profits, Samsung has announced plans to curb the number of phones  it makes each year by between a quarter and a third. Instead of saturating the market with Samsung devices, the firm has decided it needs to concentrate on making fewer handsets, better . Despite a drop in profits, Samsung has retained its leading position in the global smartphone market during the last quarter. But, it was the only top five manufacturer to record a sales decline. Apple, Xiaomi, Lenovo and LG all posted more than 15 per cent growth in their smartphone shipments, according to market research firm IDC. Samsung's shipments fell 8 per cent to 78.1 million smartphones in the third quarter, and its market share eroded to 24 per cent from 33 per cent this time last year. Samsung's rise to the world's top smartphone maker was helped by its partnership with Google's Android operating system. But other Android handset makers are matching Samsung in terms of performance, features and design. Shares of Samsung Electronics did rise 4 per cent, however, in Seoul. Although the earnings were weak, they were better than some forecasts. Plus Samsung said it is expecting a strong fourth quarter in the run up to Christmas. The strategy was unveiled during a presentation in New York by Samsung's head of investor relations, Robert Yi. He said the company would reduce the number of smartphone models in 2015 by between a quarter and a third. Last month, for the third consecutive quarter, Samsung's profits took a hit. The smartphone maker reported its lowest quarterly earnings in three years, after profits plummeted by 60 per cent compared to the same time last year. Compared to a record-high of £6 billion ($9.5 billion) in 2013, the company achieved £2.5 billion ($3.8 billion) profits for July to September. These figures were in line with what Samsung predicted earlier in October, and the firm blamed the drop on weak sales of its new Galaxy model. The South Korean electronics giant became the biggest smartphone brand thanks to the popularity of earlier Galaxy models. But the larger screen on Apple's new iPhone 6 has been linked with luring customers away from the larger Galaxy range. While in China, local brands are making inroads into Samsung's business. In response to the dramatic drop, Samsung also vowed to revamp its smartphone range to win back customers. Executives at the South Korean firm said it would overhaul its lower-tier line-up to boost price competitiveness, and use higher-quality components to set its devices apart. 'The mid-to-low end market is growing rapidly, and we plan to respond actively in order to capitalise on that growth,' said Samsung Senior Vice President Kim Hyun-joon during a conference call with analysts. In a rare acknowledgement, Mr Yi added that Samsung had lagged behind changing market conditions. Analysts claim the bigger iPhones released last month (shown) will likely take away customers who favoured Samsung Galaxy's larger screens. In emerging markets, such as India and China, Samsung's smartphone sales have been overtaken by local rivals . The company's response 'was not quick enough,' said Mr Yi. The earnings were below the median of analysts' expectations of £3 billion ($4.9 billion), according to FactSet, a financial data provider. The decline in Galaxy sales has also hurt demand for Samsung components such as an advanced display called OLED. 'The operating margin declined due to increased marketing expenditure and lowered average selling price,' Samsung said. The company said it 'cautiously expects increased shipments of new smartphones and strong seasonal demand for TV products'. The latest profit drop comes despite the launch of the Samsung Galaxy S5 (pictured) earlier this year, which was received by mostly rave reviews. The Galaxy S5 handpicked features from its competitors and put them all into a single handset, with some calling it a 'superphone' In emerging markets, such as India and China, Samsung's smartphone sales were overtaken by local rivals. 'Rather than seeking stability, Samsung should seek to distinguish [its phones] with Galaxy's design policies,' Lee Seung-woo, an analyst at IBK Securities said. The company moved the launch of the Galaxy Note 4, a large smartphone with a stylus, to late September from October after Apple unveiled the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. It also began sales of the Galaxy Note 4 in China last month, getting an early start in the world's most populous country before Apple.","The handset, appears to have a 5.5inch screen and thin design .

"If you sleep with your phone under your pillow, or check Facebook before doing anything else in the morning, you may have an unhealthy ‘digital diet.’ A team of Californian developers has created an app that helps people track how much they use their phones, and specific apps - and weans themselves off, if necessary. Called QualityTime, it works in the background to monitor how many times a screen is unlocked, how long someone spends playing certain games, or which apps they open the most. QualityTime works in the background to monitor smartphone and app usage. It tracks how many times a screen is unlocked, which apps users open the most, and shows a daily timeline (pictured left). The free Android app also shows how much time is spent on individual apps over the course of a week (pictured right) Users can also switch off from their smartphone completely by choosing to lock their screen for set periods of time. The app was created by cloud desktop firm ZeroDesktop. President and co-founder of ZeroDesktop Richard Sah said: ‘Smartphone use has become so widely integrated into our everyday lives, it’s difficult for people to realise just how frequently and compulsively they use their phones. ‘If you asked me whether I'm addicted to my smartphone, I would say absolutely not. 'Then I discovered that I spend three hours a day on my phone simply out of habit.’ QualityTime reveals smartphone and app use both in terms of frequency and duration, meaning users can spot habits and trends. Alerts will sound if usage exceeds a certain amount of time, and the app can be connected to smart household gadgets such as lights, to flash warnings instead. The app summarises information into daily or weekly phone use including total app usage, phone unlock frequency, and detailed reporting - known as a ‘digital diet’ Users can also choose to ‘Take a Break’, at which point the app will lock the screen and prevent them using the phone for a set amount of time . It also shows how often a user unlocks their phone, how often they open a certain app, or a certain time of day usage is  high. The app summarises this information into daily or weekly timelines, including total app usage, phone unlock frequency, and detailed reporting - known as a ‘digital diet’. Users can also create alert notifications on the app, or via connected gadgets such as smart lights, when they exceed a certain time using the phone or app. They can also choose to ‘Take a Break’, at which point the app will lock the screen and prevent them from using the phone until a set amount of time has passed. The phone can still be used for emergencies during this time. And, achievements can be shared on Twitter and Facebook. ‘Whether you’ve managed to avoid Candy Crush Saga for a whole week, or just broke your own personal record for watching films on Netflix, you can choose to tweet or Facebook your specific stats and compare with friends,’ added Mr Sah. ZeroDesktop has previously created controls apps and software for school and preschools. ‘We’ve all noticed that habitual phone-checking is the norm - whether you’re bored, tired, eating dinner or chatting to friends,’ said chief architect at ZeroDesktop Frank Pesek . ‘In 2017, more than half the population of the world will own a smartphone, and so this is a phenomenon that will continue to grow. 'We are always looking for new ways to help people understand their digital diet and use their time effectively.’ QualityTime is a free app available from Google Play. The company has not announced when an iOS version will be released. Dr Richard Graham runs a technology addiction programme at London's Capio Nightingale Hospital. He suggests beginning with a controlled  withdrawal, which may start with a few days of complete abstinence followed by a controlled reintroduction. After the initial 72-hour detox, the treatment varies according to the severity of the case and the level of adaption. Initially, Dr Graham said people will show distress and signs of withdrawal, much like any addict would feel. 'The challenge starts when we reintroduce technology back into their lives in a controlled manner, as technology is an integral part of our everyday lives it is important that a good relationship habit is established,' he said. Establishing a maximum daily time allowance is also a good place to start, as well as strict times of abstinence. Techniques include leaving a phone off or on silent at meal times, and when with friends and family. Dr Graham continued that it is especially important for sleep hygiene that iPads and iPhones are not used before bed. This means keeping them in a different room overnight to stop both parents and children from using technology straight before, during and after sleep. The hospital offers an online test that assesses the extent of a person's relationship with technology.","QualityTime works in the background to monitor phone and app usage .

"The bodybuilding model who was killed by a train while filming a sports advert video in LA was allegedly trying to outrun it when he was struck. Greg Plitt, among the more recognizable faces and physiques in the fitness industry, was shooting a video for his website with two crew members when the Metrolink commuter train hit him Saturday afternoon in Burbank, authorities and friends said. On Monday law enforcement sources told TMZ that Plitt was attempting to outrun an oncoming train when the accident happened. Scroll down for video . Greg Plitt, the bodybuilding model who was killed by a train while filming a sports advert video in LA, was allegedly trying to outrun it when he was struck . Plitt, among the more recognizable faces and physiques in the fitness industry, was shooting a video for his website with two crew members . His girlfriend Christina Stejskal told the LA Times he was 'just trying to get the best shot.' 'He wanted to push things to the limit,' said a weeping Stejskal in an interview Monday. 'He's just like Superman.' On Monday Metrolink officials told the LA Times that Plitt and his film crew did not have permission to be on the commuter railroad's right-of-way. 'He had no permit to be there,' said Jeff Lustgarten, a Metrolink spokesman. 'We have a whole process for people to go through if they want to be on our right-of-way, especially for film crews.' Previous workout videos featuring Plitt have shown him working out along train tracks next to rolling trains . Physique: Plitt was considered a model for aspiring bodybuilders and fitness junkies, racking up millions of views on his Youtube videos . Warren Coulter, who had been friends for 15 years with 37-year-old George Gregory Plitt Jr., who went by 'Greg' said: 'It was just a freaky moment where something got out of control.' Coulter told The Associated Press that Plitt was a West Point graduate and Army Ranger who had jumped out of planes more than 1,000 times in his life and had a taste for the extreme, but also treated everyone and everything with respect and care as befitted his military past. 'Everything Greg did, he did extremely well,' Coulter said. 'This isn't anyone who ever took a nap.' Coulter said he spoke to members of the film crew and says Plitt misjudged the situation and tripped and fell before he was hit by the train. 'No question of it, it was just a mistake,' Coulter said. Investigators have ruled out a suicide, and were trying to determine who directed the men to film without a permit in a restricted area of the tracks Saturday afternoon. They have interviewed witnesses who saw Plitt standing on the track even as the train's horn was blaring, Burbank police Sgt. Scott Meadows said. Plitt, a native of Baltimore who settled in Los Angeles more than 10 years ago, appeared on more than 200 magazine covers, Bravo's reality television shows 'Work Out' and 'Friends to Lovers' and NBC's daytime soap opera 'Days of Our Lives,' according to his personal website. A motivational video on the website shows Plitt working out on the tracks as a Metrolink train passes by. Metrolink spokesman Scott Johnson said Monday that the Los Angeles-region commuter train system tries to warn people when it sees they have posted images or videos of themselves on its tracks, but he didn't know whether Plitt had been contacted in the past. Walking on tracks is trespassing, Johnson said. 'The tracks are for one thing — trains,' he said. It appears Plitt may have believed the train was on a nearby, parallel track, Meadows said. 'It's like a blind turn,' he said. 'When the train came, you might not be able to tell which set the train is on.'","Greg Plitt, 37, was struck by Metrolink train and pronounced dead at scene .

"Skiers and snowboarders in Scotland were rewarded with heavy snowfall and freezing temperatures at the weekend, tempting thousands of snowsports fans to head for the hills - literally. And with fresh snow on the way, Scottish resorts are expecting a rush of skiers hitting the slopes. But while conditions were described as 'excellent' over the weekend, the rush to get to the Highlands caused chaos on the roads, with many motorists leaving their cars parked on the roadside. As many resorts in Europe struggle with poor weather, dumploads of snow in Scotland created ideal skiing and snowboarding conditions at the weekend . Police were called to deal with gridlocked traffic on the A82 - the main road linking Fort William and Glasgow - after abandoned cars left the road impassable in places, while the icy conditions meant other roads were closed entirely. An accident - which killed one pedestrian - left one of the main roads to the Scottish ski centre at Glenshee closed for most of Sunday, and another access road to the resort was impassable due to heavy snow and ice. It was a similar situation at the Lecht ski centre,  prompting police to ask both resorts to evacuate and close early over fears for safety. Temperatures in some parts of Scotland plunged to -15C tonight, making it the coldest night of the year so far. But while conditions on the slopes were described as 'excellent', the rush to get to the Highlands caused chaos on the roads, with many motorists leaving their cars parked on the roadside . The big chill is expected to last until Thursday, causing the Met Office to issue a yellow 'be aware' warning for snow and ice. The warning covers the eastern coastline of the Highlands, including Caithness, Sutherland, Easter Ross, Inverness and Nairnshire. However, there are 'fantastic conditions' waiting for those who did made it to a number of ski resorts north of the border. The big chill is expected to last until Thursday, causing the Met Office to issue a yellow 'be aware' warning . Around 1,600 skiers and snowboarders are thought to have made it to Glencoe at the weekend, although numbers at Glenshee were slightly lower than expected due to the access problems. Elsewhere, around 4,000 people made it to the Cairngorm ski area, with perfect conditions reported on Sunday, and it's thought that the Nevis Range, near Ben Nevis, welcomed more than 3,000 visitors. Enthusiastic skiers and boarders took to Twitter to express their delight at the premium conditions. Guy Daynes ‏@GuyDaynes, wrote: 'No wind, blues skies, snow and sub-zero temperatures.

Around 1,600 skiers and snowboarders are thought to have made it Glencoe at the weekend, although numbers at Glenshee were slightly lower than expected due to the access problems . The dumpload of snow at the weekend also coincided with World Snow Day - a Féderation Internationale du Ski initiative to encourage people onto the slopes. Scotland's ski usually suffer unsettled weather in January, this weekend's snowfall was an unexpected boost to the country's wintersports industry, which is worth around £30million annually to the economy. Chair of Ski Scotland Heather Negus said: 'As World Snow Day timing is never ideal for Scotland, we are also planning our own celebratory Ski Scotland Snowfest in March, when the Scottish mountains weather is more likely to play ball.'","Police called as cars block A82 between Fort William and Glasgow .

"The AirAsia plane that crashed into the Java Sea last month  climbed faster than 'normal speed' and stalled, Indonesia's Transport Minister has revealed. All 162 people on board flight QZ8501 are thought to have died when it crashed during a short trip from Surabaya to Singapore. At an earlier parliamentary hearing, Ignasius Jonan said radar data showed the Airbus A320-200 was climbing at a rate of 6,000ft (1,800m) a minute before the crash. He added: 'I think it is rare even for a fighter jet to be able to climb 6,000ft per minute. 'For a commercial flight, climbing around 1,000 to 2,000 (feet) is maybe already considered extraordinary, because it is not meant to climb that fast.' Stalled: Indonesia's Transport Minster said flight QZ8501 was climbing abnormally fast before it stalled . Unusual: Citing radar data, Ignasius Jonane revealed it was climbing at 6,000ft per minute - which is 'rare even for a fighter jet', he said . Conclusive: As a police officer guards part of the fuselage of the jet, investigators are analysing  the flight data recorder, which monitors every major part of the plane to determine what caused the crash . Lost: All but seven of those on board the routine flight from Surabaya to Singapore were Indonesian . Tragedy: The AirAsia jet crashed into the Java Sea last month with 162 people on board, who are all thought to have died . Investigation: Judging from the plane's voice recorder, investigators ruled out the possibility that terrorists were to blame for the crash . The country's meteorological agency thought bad weather may have caused the tragedy, and investigators are still studying the plane's black box before releasing an official report. But it's emerged the pilot asked for permission to climb to a higher altitude to avoid the storm, moments before the plane disappeared from radar. His request was not granted due to 'heavy air traffic'. The Transport Minister added: 'In the final minutes, the plane climbed at a speed which was beyond normal. 'The plane suddenly went up at a speed above the normal limit that it was able to climb to. Then it stalled.' This latest revelation comes as Indonesian investigators focused on the possibility of human error, or mechanical problems with the plane having caused the crash - following an initial analysis of the cockpit voice recorder. Terrorism had already been ruled out according to investigator Nurcahyo Utomo, who said: 'We didn't hear any other person, no explosion.' As well as the cockpit voice recorder, the committee is also examining a wealth of information in the flight data recorder, which monitors every major part of the plane. A preliminary report will be releasd on January 28. Mourning: Rescuers have only been able to recover 53 bodies from the plane, after a massive international search helped to discover the crash sites . Confusion: Moments before the plane disappeared from radar, the pilot's request to climb to a higher altitude to avoid a storm was denied . Discovery: Last week, a Singapore navy ship located the jet's main body, with the AirAsia motto 'Now Everyone Can Fly' painted on the side . Unsuccessful recovery: Divers have failed to reach the fuselage, despite several attempts due to bad weather . Ships from several different countries, including the US and China, were involved in a huge international hunt for the crashed plane. Indonesian search and rescue teams have so far recovered just 53 bodies from the sea. But last week, a Singapore navy ship located the jet's main body - with the AirAsia motto 'Now Everyone Can Fly' painted on the side. Rescue teams hope they will be able to find many of the passengers and crew inside. Divers have so far failed to reach the fuselage despite several attempts due to bad weather, high waves and strong underwater currents. All but seven of those on board the flight were Indonesian. The foreign nationals were from South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Britain and France.","Radar data shows plane climbed at 6,000ft per minute before disappearing .

"Make-up artist Jordan James Parke loves Kim Kardashian so much he's shelled out £100,000 on procedures to look like her. He copies her beauty regime, her make-up and even has clothes made that are inspired by her outfits. Now the British superfan, 23, is taking his transformation even further - he's having implants to get a bottom as large as the reality star's. Scroll down for video . Jordan James Peele has spent £100,000 to look like his inspiration, reality star Kim Kardashian . Jordan's idol Kim Kardashian shared the front cover of her new book of selfies, Selfish, published by Rizzoli . It takes him two hours to copy Kim's make-up every day, evening using drops to mimic her bright eyes . Jordan has had lip fillers to copy Kim's glossy pout, cheek and chin fillers to define his jawline and approximate her bone structure and he's had thick, exaggerated brows tattooed on his face. Appearing on This Morning on ITV today, he said: 'I love Kim, I love her so much. I've always admired strong women. 'I was brought up by my mum and my nan so I've always admired strong women.' Jordan, who began his Kardashian transformation four years ago said he's similarly infatuated with Mariah Carey and Katie Price but Kim is his top idol. Along with the injectables, he's had his eyebrows tattooed, micro-dermabrasion and regular 'vampire' treatments, in which is blood is extracted from his arm and injected in his face to help rejuvenate his skin - a facial Kim underwent on her show. He said: 'As soon as I saw Kim get it done on Keeping Up With The Kardashians I was just like, oh my God, I need to try that, I need to get it done.' The British make-up artist has had fillers injected into his jawline to give him more definition . Along with tattooed eyebrows and lip fillers, he has regular micro-dermabrasion and 'vampire' facials . But Jordan's body transformation is far from complete. He's about to boost his bottom to the same size as the curvaceous beauty. 'I love her bum, her bum's amazing. When she did the cover when the bum was out, I think she looked amazing, she's an inspiration. 'I'd like to go as big as her. I'm not going to get implants, I won't go down the route of implants. 'I've been looking at body contouring, it's quite big in America. 'I want to get liposuction on my stomach and back. I lost 70lb last year, I'm so lazy, I never exercise so I want to get lipo on my stomach and back and they put the fat back into your bum so you get two procedures in one and you get a big bum.' Jordan has regular 'vampire' facials in which platelets from his blood are injected into his face to boost skin . Jordan was inspired to have the gory-looking treatment after seeing Kim have the facial on TV in 2013 . But there are downsides to looking like Kim, including having such swollen lips that they've lost feeling. But he's also hurt by nasty comments from internet trolls criticising his behaviour. He said: 'I've always worked, I've worked since I was 13. I'm a make-up artist and I work in a health club as well. 'I've  had boyfriends in the past who've funded my lifestyle and they've paid for things. I've come from a hard-working family. Jordan, whose top lip can sometimes feel numb, has also had Mariah Carey's name tattooed on his arm . 'Kim's lips are big, they're obviously not as big as mine,' he added, before explaining that he uses eye-drops every day to mimic her bright eyes.

Jordan has tattooed both arms, as well as his eyebrows and won't rest until he has Kim's big bottom . 'I saw hate online, but I've never taken any money off the NHS, I've never been on benefits. I do loads for charity - they don't know what I donate for charity.' And to critics who think his obsession with changing his appearance can only stem from low self-esteem he said: 'I'm extremely confident. I love the way I look. 'People  don't understand how you can look different and be confident.' But what would Kim think about his efforts? 'I think she'd be like, ""good for him whatever he wants to do"".' he said. He spends two hours every day copying Kim's sculpting and shadowing contouring make-up techniques .

"Senior Iranian and Hezbollah figures killed in an airstrike in Syria this weekend were likely planning an 'imminent' attack on Israel, security sources have claimed. Six Iranian army chiefs died alongside five Hezbollah militants after an Israeli helicopter  fired rockets at a convoy in the Golan Heights region on Sunday. Among those killed was Iranian General Mohammed Allahdadi, as well as commander Abu Ali Tabatabai, who is known to have worked with both Hezbollah and Iran. Today Major General Eyal Ben Reuven, a former deputy head in the Israeli Defense Forces, accused the senior military figures of meeting to plot an attack on Israel. Scroll down for video . Top Hezbollah and Iranian commanders killed in an Israeli airstrike on Sunday were meeting to discuss a plan to invade Galilee, according to a former Israeli general (pictured, Israel deploys troops today) Major General Eyal Ben Reuven said that a 'high-level' and 'sophisticated' attack on northern Israel could be 'imminent', a week after Hezbollah's leader threatened to bring war to the region . He added that the commanders' decision to meet in Syria could mean that a 'high-level' and 'sophisticated' attack on Israel's northern border is 'imminent'. Research group The Israel Project came to a similar conclusion, saying that the presence of Tabatabai 'probably indicates operations aimed at overrunning Israeli border towns.' The warnings come just a week after Hassan Nasrallah, leader of Lebanon's Hezbollah, warned that the group 'is ready and prepared for a confrontation in the Galilee and beyond the Galilee.' Jihad Mughniyeh (pictured), the son of a prominent Hezbollah leader, died alsongside Iranian General Mohammed Allahdadi on Sunday . Iran has also promised a 'crushing response' to the weekend strike, without laying out exactly what action will be taken. General Mohammad Ali Jafari, head of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, said: 'These martyrdoms proved the need to stick with jihad. The Zionists must await ruinous thunderbolts. 'The Revolutionary Guards will fight to the end of the Zionist regime... We will not rest easy until this epitome of vice is totally deleted from the region's geopolitics.' Israeli troops have been marshalled along the country's northern border, while an Iron Dome missile launcher has been deployed to destroy any incoming rockets. Senior Iranian politicians are said to be incensed at the death of Allahdadi, which they confirmed yesterday, saying he had been 'martyred' in the name of his country. Officials also denied that he had been planning any kind of attack, instead saying he had been in Syria to advise the government on how to tackle extremists such as Islamic State, who control much of the country's north. Hezbollah said that Jihad Mughniyeh, the son of a prominent commander, and Mohammed Issa, who was responsible for the group's operations in Syria and Iraq, died alongside Tabatabai. Jihad Mughniyeh was the son of Imad Mughniyeh, a senior Hezbollah figure killed in Damascus in 2008. Hezbollah accused Israel of assassinating him, but Israel has not claimed responsibility. The latest strike, which Israel has also not officially accepted responsibility for, has seen tensions in the already volatile region come to a head. Major Reuven said the presence of Hezbollah and Iranian senior commanders in Syria meant that they were likely planning an attack on Israel (pictured, troops mass in Galilee today) Iran has denied planning any attack on Israel, saying that General Allahdadi was in Syria to help advise the Assad regime on Islamic State militants that occupy the country's north . Israel has already been carrying out a series of controversial airstrikes in Syria which it says are to prevent rockets from Bashar Al-Assad's regime and Iran being passed to Hezbollah. Hezbollah has previously used such missile stockpiles to attack Israel from Lebanon, such as in the brief by bloody 33-day war between the two countries in 2006. Nasrallah had already called the strikes 'a major aggression', warning that Hezbollah has a 'right to respond', even before Sunday's attack. The attack took place in the Syrian-controlled portion of the Golan Heights region. Most of the rocky plateau in south western Syria was seized by Israel  in the closing stages of the 1967 Middle East War. About 200 square miles remains under Syrian control.","Israel carried out airstrike on convoy in Syria on Sunday killing 11 people .

"The man in possession of the football the Seattle Seahawks carried to the NFC title says he'd happily trade it to wide receiver Jermaine Kearse for tickets to the Superbowl game schedule on the eve of a jail term. Scott Shelton says he's facing 'several months' behind bars in relation to a 2013 weapons possession bust. The Superbowl happens to be scheduled on his final night of freedom. So far the 32-year-old has already refused a $20,000 offer from a sports memorabilia dealer, saying he will only release the ball to Kearse. 32-year-old Scott Shelton says he's refusing a $20k offer on the game ball to return it to Seattle Seahawk Jermaine Kearse . The bust included finding a stolen shotgun in his Washington state home. Kearse ran the ball in for a touchdown in the final moments of Sunday's game then threw it into the end zone seats in a victory celebration. It ended up in the hands of Shelton. 'Everyone's going crazy,' he told KOMO. 'I can't believe I got this ball!' Shelton has every move of those final seconds seared into his memory. 'Wilson drops back. Throws a strike to Kearse. Pulls down the game-winning catch. He got up and chucked it into the stands. And it bounced about four times. And right into my lap. Just right into my chest. Like, just, boom! Just like that. And I jumped up into the seat and just screaming!' He continued: 'It was just amazing! Amazing feeling! We just won the game. I got this thrown to me, by Kearse. It was, it was like a dream come true. It still is. I haven't woke up yet, you know.'# . Though a sports memorabilia dealer has offered him $20,000 he says he wants Kearse to have it back. At a news conference Monday the Seahawk called the toss into the stands an impulse in the moment. Shelton says the ball has been a comfort as the unemployed father of two faces personal problems . 'That throw,' he said, 'It was more so just a sigh of just frustration. Just letting a lot of frustration throughout that game out. I just tried to throw it as far as possible. It was just something that happened in the moment.' Kearse reconsidered and called Shelton Monday to ask for the ball back. 'We were just talking about the game. He told me he wanted to trade his game helmet signed by the team and his jersey, for the ball. And then he asked me what (else) I wanted for the ball,' Shelton said. 'And I said 'honestly, it would be nice to go see you guys whip New England in the Super Bowl.' So he's going to see what he can do about that. But I told him I wouldn't give it up unless it was going to him. I wouldn't want anyone else to have it.' He said some autographed team memorabilia would also be nice, if he couldn't get tickets. Kearse ran the ball in for a touchdown in the final moments of Sunday's game then threw it into the end zone seats in a victory celebration . Currently without a job and a father to two, Shelton says the ball has been a much-needed lift in his life. On 2 p.m. the day after the Superbowl he's even set to start serving a several month sentence in jail. 'This is a cool ball, man,' he said. 'To think that this is the one that I watched sail. The pass is still re-playing in my mind. It's been going all night and all day - really, that really happened!'","Scott Shelton caught the game ball after Seahawk Jermaine Kearse threw it into the stands .

"Andrew Mitchell was ordered to pay costs of £300,000 by January - but he may face a total bill of more than £2million . Disgraced former chief whip Andrew Mitchell has paid £300,000 in legal costs for his failed Plebgate libel trial, it was confirmed today. The Tory MP was ordered to pay after a high court judge threw out his attempt to sue the owners of The Sun newspaper for its claim that he called police officers 'plebs' at the gates of Downing Street. Mr Justice Mitting ruled that the former Cabinet Minister did call police officers 'f****** plebs' when they refused to let him cycle through the main Downing Street gate in 2012. The judge ordered Mr Mitchell to pay costs of £300,000 by January - but he may face a total bill of more than £2million. After launching his bid to sue the Sun newspaper Mr Mitchell was counter-sued by Metropolitan Police PC Toby Rowland - on duty on the night of the confrontation. The officer sued Mr Mitchell for claiming he he lied about the version of events. Mr Mitchell has paid £150,000 in costs each to the Police Federation & News Group Newspapers. A court will decide next week the whether Conservative MP must pay more in costs or any damages. Mr Mitchell's career was left in ruins in November last year after Mr Justice Mitting ruled the MP had called police officers 'plebs'. He said he was 'satisfied at least on the balance of probabilities that Mr Mitchell did speak the words alleged or something so close to them as to amount to the same, including the politically toxic word pleb'. The judge said PC Toby Rowland, one of four officers on the gate, was 'not the sort of man who would have had the wit, imagination or inclination to invent on the spur of the moment an account of what a senior politician had said to him in temper'. Mr Mitchell, who was educated at Rugby School and Cambridge University, had just been promoted to Government Chief Whip when the row unfolded in September 2012. The judge also rejected 'absurd' claims by millionaire Mr Mitchell that the three police officers stood at the Downing Street gates, pictured, conspired to discredit him. When officers refused to open the main gate for him, he shouted: 'Best you learn your f****** place. You don't run this f****** government. You're f****** plebs.' Mr Mitchell – who repeatedly denied calling the officers 'plebs' – resigned a month later as the scandal engulfed him. He is highly unlikely to ever hold a post in the Cabinet again. During the case the MP's lawyers submitted a plethora of statements from celebrities and leading politicians who said they had never heard him use the word 'pleb'. But it emerged that he has been accused of a pattern of insulting and high-handed behaviour towards officials on at least 16 occasions dating back to 2005. He was described as 'Jekyll and Hyde' figure who used a 'mixture of charm and menace' to keep Tory MPs in line. Yesterday a barrister said Mr Mitchell, 58, was the 'architect of his own misfortune' who has shown 'a total lack of contrition'. Andrew Mitchell has been accused of high-handed behaviour at least 16 times dating back to 2005. Those outlined to the High Court included: . NOVEMBER 2005:Mr Mitchell tried to cycle through a heavy gate into Black Rod's garden as it was being closed by a security guard. Lee Bryer shouted 'stop' several times but the MP ignored his requests and cycled through. Mr Bryer caught up with Mr Mitchell and asked him why he did not stop. Mr Mitchell allegedly said: I'm an MP and I'm too important to stop for you. Stop being so aggressive, you little s***.' MAY 2011: The MP arrived at the main gate of Downing Street on his bicycle and told officers: 'Let me in. I'm a Cabinet MP and I'm late for a meeting.' PC Bruce Smart had no idea who he was so phoned the control room at No 10. He said: 'The custodian told me that although allowing him access this way was against security policy, denying him entry would be more trouble than it was worth, and so I should just let him in.' JUNE 2011: For a second time Mr Mitchell had a confrontation with PC Smart at the Downing Street gates – but this time the officer refused to let him through due to 'security reasons'. When Iain Duncan Smith arrived by car the officers had to open the main gate. They finally allowed Mr Mitchell through after a polite request from Mr Duncan Smith. As Mr Mitchell cycled through, he allegedly said: 'Bruce Smart, is it? You shall be hearing about this. Don't think you've heard the last of this – I'm going to make a complaint to the Commissioner.' The MP demanded full disciplinary proceedings be brought against PC Smart. The officer said: 'During both my encounters with Mr Mitchell his behaviour was arrogant and rude.' JUNE 2011: PC Joseph Withington was on duty at Downing Street when Mr Mitchell allegedly shouted 'chop, chop' as officers opened the main gate for him. The MP is then alleged to have said: 'Always helps if you do this as rapidly as possible – we're all in a hurry.' PC Withington told the court Mr Mitchell used a 'condescendingly rude tone', adding: 'It's completely unnecessary, patronising and sarcastic to be spoken to like that.' AUGUST 3, 2011: When Mr Mitchell arrived in Djerba, an island off the coast of Tunisia, during his stint as International Development Secretary, he told his protection team he wanted to travel to Libya. Inspector Duncan Johnston, who ran the team, told him such a trip was not possible as it would breach international law. Mr Mitchell allegedly replied: 'That's a bit above your pay grade, Mr Plod.' Inspector Johnston said he found this 'rather insulting, discourteous and demeaning'. AUGUST 17, 2011: Two weeks later Mr Mitchell 'launched into a foul-mouthed tirade' at members of his protection team when a trip from Kenya to Somalia was changed for security reasons. Inspector Johnston said: 'He used a tirade of language that … was just swearing for the sake of swearing.' Mr Mitchell demanded to know how many officers had been sent to Kenya in advance of him and allegedly accused them of treating it as a holiday. He allegedly said: 'British taxpayers are funding this for police officers to sit by the pool.' EARLY SEPTEMBER, 2012: On one visit to Downing Street Mr Mitchell had to cycle through the pedestrian gate, rather than the main gate. He shouted to officers: 'I'm coming through that gate next time.' PC Michael Penton said: 'I found Mr Mitchell's behaviour to be rude and condescending.' SEPTEMBER 18, 2012: On the night before 'Plebgate', Mr Mitchell allegedly shouted: 'I'm the Government Chief Whip. I want to leave through these gates.' PC Gareth Bonds said: 'During this exchange I stood and watched in disbelief at how childish a grown man in his position was being and found it embarrassing. 'I therefore spoke to my colleagues and told them to just open the gates as it was ridiculous to argue over a gate. I found Mr Mitchell's tone overbearing.'","Mr Mitchell lost libel case against News Group in November .

"Police are hunting a doctor accused of 'killing' an Ecuadorian beauty queen who had no interest in plastic surgery but whose family claims she was pestered into going under the knife. The family of 19-year-old Catherine Cando, who dreamed of becoming a doctor and was crowned queen of the city of Durán in October, today demanded answers from the medic who they claim pestered her into undergoing liposuction as a prize for winning the contest. Catherine, who was a healthy weight and never wanted surgery, died during the procedure despite saying in an interview shortly after the contest: 'I don't want to do it. I don't need it.' 'She never had weight problems,' Catherine's brother, Daniel Zavala told MailOnline. 'But this doctor called lots of times. He insisted.' Today they released heartbreaking pictures of Catherine as a little girl to help warn against the dangers of cosmetic surgery. It comes as police hunt doctor accused of 'pestering' her into undergoing liposuction. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Catherine died from the procedure despite clearly being a healthy weight and insisting: 'I don't want to do it. I don't need it' Childhood: Catherine (pictured as a four-year-old) aspired to become a doctor in order to help people and despite her good looks, she never showed much interest in beauty contests . Tragic: Catherine died from the procedure despite insisting: 'I don't want to do it. I don't need it' Beauty pageant: The liposuction was a prize for being named Queen of Durán in October . Catherine was said to be at ease with her figure and had no interest in surgical enhancement. The procedure was not an official prize - a tablet computer and a new car were sponsored by the government - but Dr Gustavo Berh, who served on the beauty pageant's judging panel, offered free liposuction for the winner. Ecuadorian media reported the doctor wanted to use the image of the Queen of Durán in publicity shots for his medical practice. 'It was a marketing strategy by the surgeon, Gustavo Berh,' a statement released by Durán city government a day after her funeral stated. The beauty queen initially said she would donate the prize to someone more in need of plastic surgery, but Dr Berh said it was non-transferable. As well as the phone calls to Catherine, a pre-med university student, Dr Berh invited her to watch several operations and hinted she could become his assistant, according to her mother Betsabe Cornejo. He finally convinced her by promising to reduce her waistline from 60cm to 57cm which might help the beauty queen win future contests. On Saturday morning, Catherine entered a clinic in Guayaquil, Ecuador's largest city, for what was supposed to be a two-hour operation. According to health officials, she died at about 6pm of cerebral edema - the accumulation of fluid in the brain. Brotherly love: 'She never had weight problems,' Catherine's brother, Daniel Zavala told MailOnline. 'But this doctor called her lots of times. He insisted' Healthy weight: Catherine was clearly not overweight yet was pressured into liposuction after Dr Gustavo Berh, who served on the beauty pageant's judging panel, offered free surgery for the winner so he could use the results in PR material for his clinic, it is claimed . Convinced: As well as the phone calls to Catherine, a pre-med university student, Dr Berh invited her to watch several operations and hinted she could become his assistant, according to her mother . The teenage beauty queen died on the operating table, after allegedly being pressured into undergoing liposuction . But, when family members tried to find out what went wrong, the could not be reached. The Ecuadorian Health Ministry and the Attorney General's office have opened an investigation into the clinic and Dr Behr. Gen. Ignacio Benitez, chief of police of the Guayaquil region that includes the city of Duran, said the police are collaborating with the Attorney General's office in the investigation. On Friday, police and agents from the Attorney General's offfice searched a building in Guayaquil looking for the doctor. But he was not there and the investigation continues. Ecuadorian media has reported that Dr Behr is officially registered as a general practitioner but not as a plastic surgeon. However, Francisco Vera, president of the doctors association of the state of Guayas, which surrounds Guayaquil, said Dr. Behr was indeed a surgeon . Catherine (pictured here as a child), who was only 19 at the time of her death, next planned to enter the state-wide Miss Guayas pageant and even dreamed of becoming Miss Ecuador . Decision: Catherine's aunts persuaded her to enter the Queen of Durán contest. Here she is pictured (left and left in right picture) in her winner's sash . Despite her mother's objections, Catherine began an exercise and diet regime and her weight went from 140lbs to 117lbs. She then beat 13 other candidates to win the pageant . 'What I want is for this doctor to explain what happened,' said Cornejo, a single mom who raised Catherine and four other children largely on her own in Durán. She said her daughter aspired to become a doctor in order to help people and despite her good looks, she never showed much interest in beauty contests. However, while Cornejo was traveling in the U.S. last year, Catherine's aunts persuaded her to enter the Queen of Durán contest. Despite her mother's objections, Catherine began an exercise and diet regime and her weight went from 140lbs to 117lbs. She then beat 13 other women to win the pageant. The beauty queen made the front cover of Expresiones magazine. The doctor finally convinced her to undergo the procedure by promising to reduce her waistline . 'She was the only candidate who stood out for both her beauty and her intelligence,' explained her brother, Zavala. He said Catherine next planned to enter the state-wide Miss Guayas pageant and even dreamed of becoming Miss Ecuador. Isaac Torres, who was dating Cando, said  these ambitions plus her growing friendship with Dr Behr finally tilted the scales in favor of liposuction. The operation was performed on the same day he was due to celebrate his eight-month anniversary with her. Torres bought a dozen red roses to surprise Catherine that evening but she never left the hospital. The surgery was carried out at this clinic by Dr Gustavo Berh, who served on the judging panel at the beauty pageant . Mourners at Catherine Cando's funeral, held just months after she was named winner of the beauty contest . Lawyer Carlos Reyes Izquierdo said: 'I was told she had died of a brain edema. 'But the clinic staff told her relatives that she had died of a cardiac arrest. 'I have ordered cytological and pathological examinations to find out what exactly happened. 'There has been no support from doctors who have failed to explain anything about the case.'","Brother of Catherine Cando, 19, said doctor insisted on the surgery .

"Former NFL star Jerramy Stevens has been arrested for drunken driving in Los Angeles with his 'belligerent' wife Hope Solo in the car. TMZ.com reports that Stevens, 36, was pulled over shortly before 2am Monday after allegedly swerving his car in the road. He was booked into jail after refusing an alcohol breath test. Scroll down for video . Hope Solo was in the car when her husband Jerramy Steven was arrested for drunk driving. The sports star couple reportedly told cops: 'Don't you know who we are?' Mugshot: Stevens was pulled over shortly before 2am Monday after allegedly swerving his car in the road . Solo, a Team USA soccer star, was also in the car and was nearly arrested for disorderly conduct after she became 'belligerent' while officers conducted the traffic stop, according to TMZ. A police source told TMZ that the couple were 'a major pain' during the incident. The pair reportedly told cops 'Don't you know who we are?' before Stevens was cuffed and carted away. On Monday afternoon, Solo was spotted stepping into her Los Angeles hotel after a workout, but refused to comment on her husband's arrest, according to TMZ. Stevens played nine seasons in the NFL as a tight end, including a Super Bowl appearance with the Seattle Seahawks, before he retired in 2010. Solo was pictured on Monday at her LA hotel - but refused to comment on the drunk driving arrest of her husband the morning before . The arrest came less than a week after domestic violence charges against 33-year-old Solo were dismissed after she was arrested for assaulting her nephew and her sister during an allegedly drunken brawl. During her court appearances, Stevens showed up to support his wife. Solo, the two-time gold medal-winning goalkeeper for the US Women's National Team, is one of the most famous female athletes in the country. She and Stevens have been together since August 2012. In November 2012, he was arrested after allegedly beating Solo, but a judge ruled there was not enough evidence to hold him.

She was accompanied to court by her husband of two years, Jerramy Stevens . The couple married the day after his release. When Stevens was a football player at the University of Washington, he was arrested after he was accused of drugging and raping a 19-year-old student at a fraternity party. The prosecutor declined to press charges, but he and the fraternity were later forced to pay out $300,000 as to settle a civil suit brought by the alleged victim.","Stevens refused an alcohol breath test but was arrested for drunk driving anyway on Monday morning .

"When Keely Shaw broke up with her long term boyfriend, she chalked her tiredness and headaches down to being heartbroken and exhausted. But after collapsing on a day trip to London, she was rushed to hospital where doctors said she had suffered an unexplained seizure. She got the train back home to Pontefract, West Yorkshire, to recuperate, but after that point, her memory goes blank. It emerged she was suffering from autoimmune encephalitis, a rare but potentially deadly illness which begins as flu-like symptoms but causes the brain to swell. Scroll down for video . Keely Shaw, 27, thought she was exhausted because of the heartbreak of a break-up. But she actually had autoimmune encephalitis, a rare disease which caused her to have seizures as her brain was swelling . Miss Shaw went to see a friend in London to take her mind off the break up. However she collapsed and was rushed to hospital, where doctors said she had suffered an unexplained seizure . She had suffered eight more seizures and was eventually being put into an induced coma for six weeks. When she woke up in January 2014 she had missed Christmas, and had to begin chemotherapy treatment to stop her body attacking cells in her brain. When she was in a coma she had also developed gangrene in her bowel as a clot had formed and stopped the blood from reaching the area. She had been rushed for emergency surgery on December 23rd to have a foot of her bowel removed, and had a colostomy bag fitted. But the 27-year-old is now on the road to recovery, with the help of her family and her nine-year-old daughter, Grace. Miss Shaw recalls how quickly and unexpectedly the illness came on last year. 'I'd been with my ex for around 11 months,' she told MailOnline. 'I was upset, although knew it was for the best when it ended. ''But the break up had taken it out of me and I'd been exhausted. 'I just felt a bit ill. I'd felt run down and suffered headaches.' So she organised a trip to London in November 2013 to perk her up and keep her mind off the break-up. 'I was planning to see my friend Craig,' she said. 'Grace was staying with my parents. 'He picked me up from the station and we went to his house. He popped opened a bottle of champagne, started to pour it. Doctors put Miss Shaw into an induced coma for six weeks while they treated her for autoimmune encephalitis. During this time, her bowel became gangrenous due to a blood clot and she had part of it removed. She is pictured after waking up from the coma, and soon had a colostomy bag fitted . Although the initial shock passed, for a number of weeks she was still too frail to see her daughter Grace, who stayed with her parents. She says the moment she saw her daughter again was 'brilliant' Autoimmune encephalitis is a serious medical condition in which the immune system attacks the brain, impairing function. It caused by a problem with the immune system (the body's natural defence against infection). The immune system mistakes healthy tissue in the brain as a threat and attacks it, causing the brain to become inflamed and swell. The body produces antibodies which attack the NMDA receptors in the brain, which are proteins that cause electrical impulses. Their functioning is necessary for judgement, perception of reality, human interaction, memory, and the control of unconscious activities such as breathing and swallowing. It's not always clear why the immune system malfunctions in this way. Some cases of autoimmune encephalitis are caused by the immune system reacting to the presence of a tumour (an abnormal growth) inside the body. The main symptoms are flu like, but people also develop memory loss, difficulty sleeping, and may become unable to communicate or speak coherently. They might become confused, have hallucinations or exhibit strange behaviour. Other symptoms include seizures, loss of consciousness and movement disorders. Source: The Anti-NMDA Receptor Encephalitis Foundation . 'But I said no. And I never turned down bubbles. 'I remember I really didn't feel well.' Hours later she collapsed and was taken by ambulance to hospital where doctors said it was an unexplained seizure. She continued: 'Doctors told me they had done tests and couldn't find anything wrong.' She returned to her parents' house in West Yorkshire, but that week suffered seven more seizures, ending up in hospital. 'I started behaving very aggressively and shouting at people,' she said. 'I was put in an induced coma.' She developed a blood clot in her bowel which blocked the blood from getting to the area, leading to gangrene – where the tissue rots and dies. While still in a coma, she had to have emergency surgery to remove the gangrenous part of the bowel, while her family stood by, hoping for the best. She woke up confused, with a tube in her nose, having no memory of the seizures. 'I didn't remember coming home from London, I didn't remember that week, I didn't remember the seizures. 'I didn't understand why I had a tube up my nose.' Although the initial shock passed, for a number of weeks she was still too frail to see her daughter, who stayed with her parents. Doctors said Miss Shaw had suffered from autoimmune encephalitis, also known as anti-NDMA receptor encephalitis. This is a serious medical condition in which the immune system attacks NDMA receptors, which are proteins that control electrical impulses in the brain. They are necessary for judgement, perception of reality, interaction, memory and also control unconscious activities like breathing and swallowing, which is why this type of encephalitis is so serious. Miss Shaw was treated with chemotherapy drug cyclophosphamide to kill the antibodies - immune cells – that were attacking cells in her brain. Miss Shaw was treated with chemotherapy drug cyclophosphamide to kill the antibodies - immune cells – that were attacking cells in her brain. She is pictured here before being hospitalised with encephalitis . She said: 'I had chemotherapy every month to battle the infection which had caused my brain to swell. 'My hair started to thin, although I didn't lose it entirely and I was too weak to eat, was fed through a tube and lost three stone.' Finally, she was discharged from hospital and moved back in with her parents to further aid her recovery. 'At the beginning of March – four months after I collapsed – I was discharged and went to stay with mum and dad,' she said. 'Seeing Grace again was brilliant. 'I started building up weight and went back for chemo appointments every month until June, but then doctors said I could stop, although they see me as an outpatient. She has to take anti-seizure and steroid medication to stop the swelling in her brain, which she says make her 'tired and emotional' and prone to be completely knocked out by illnesses like a cold. Miss Shaw is now on the road to recovery thanks to the help of her family and daughter Grace. Though the medication she now takes leaves her 'tired and emotional', she hopes to go back to work as a financial advisor once her colostomy bag is removed . 'My neurologist has said in three years I could be medication-free,' she said, 'so fingers crossed.' Adjusting to life with a colostomy bag has also been difficult, leaving her tired and in pain. 'It can get you down, it's really painful and it can stop you doing lots of things. 'There are people who have got them for life and they just get on with it.' 'But I'm lucky mine is reversible – it gives me hope that it will be removed soon.' In a few months she will have a procedure sin which they will remove the colostomy bag and stitch up her bowel so it can function normally. Once the bag is removed, she hopes to go back to work as a financial advisor. 'It's horrible not working, because I've worked since I was 16,' she said. 'It's what I've always done. Moving back in with my mum and dad, that was a big change too.' 'They are so brilliant, I can't complain.' She is also proud at how well her daughter has coped with the terrifying ordeal of her mother being hospitalised and in a coma. She said: 'She seems to just get on with it. If I'm unwell she makes me a get well card, if I'm tired she just leaves me to it. 'She took my story in a magazine to show her friends at school, she's dead proud of me.'","Keely Shaw, 27, thought she was exhausted and unwell after a break up .

"The heartbroken former fiancée of tycoon Scot Young attended his funeral yesterday with more than 100 guests - including his daughters and the model Caprice. The service was held at Kensal Green Cemetery in west London more than six weeks after the Dundee-born property magnate fell to his death from the balcony of their luxury penthouse. Noelle Reno, 31, joined his daughters Scarlet, 21, and Sasha, 19, at the service this afternoon, but it appears 52-year-old Mr Young's ex-wife Michelle, 50, decided to stay away. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: Tycoon Scot Young's funeral was held at Kensal Green Cemetery in west London yesterday - six weeks after he fell 60ft to his death from the balcony of his penthouse . Paying her respects: Noelle Reno, the former fiancée of tycoon Mr Young, attended his funeral . Heartbroken: Among the attendees at the service this afternoon were hit daughters Scarlet, 21, and Sasha, 19 . Moving: Mr Young's two daughters had the word 'Daddy' made out of flowers to accompany his body . In attendance: More than 100 guests, including former model-turned-businesswoman Caprice (pictured), who appeared alongside Miss Reno in the reality TV show Ladies Of London, were at the private service . Mr Young, who was said to have had a fortune of £2billion and was involved in one of Britain's most notorious divorce cases, plunged 60ft on to railings outside a £3million apartment last month. His coffin, covered in white roses, was carried in a hearse with flowers spelling 'Daddy'. Relatives arrived in a fleet of more than a dozen luxury cars, headed by two black limousines. Mourners were driven to a private entrance of the chapel for the service which lasted around one hour, before the coffin was driven to the grave site within the cemetery for the burial ceremony. Mr Young, a one-time fixer to the super rich, was found impaled on metal railings outside a luxury flat in Montagu Square in Marylebone, central London, in the early evening of December 8. He had been one of Britain's wealthiest men, with a series of multi-million pound properties in Surrey, Mayfair, Knightsbridge and Miami, and a collection of supercars and a private jet. But he then became embroiled in one of the most high profile and nastiest divorce cases ever seen in the UK, with ex-wife Michelle accusing him of hiding millions from her and their two daughters. High profile: Mr Young, pictured (left) with his ex-girlfriend Noelle, became embroiled in one of the  nastiest divorce cases ever seen in the UK, with his ex-wife Michelle (right), 50, who accused him of hiding millions . Service: More than 100 guests attended the funeral of Mr Young at Kensal Green Crematorium . In shock: The exact circumstances of Mr Young's death remain a mystery and an inquest will be held this year . Tributes: The flowers and coffin in west London were accompanied by handwritten notes from loved-ones . Close up: Among the tributes, one message read: 'We will always miss you very much. In your absence you will remain by Sasha and Scarlet's side' Many of the father-of-two’s relatives and friends were driven to a private entrance to the crematorium chapel before his burial at the cemetery. In cold and bright weather, the hearse arrived carrying a mahogany coffin topped with floral tributes, including one made of roses from his daughters, which read 'Daddy'. Among the tributes, one message read: 'We will always miss you very much. In your absence you will remain by Sasha and Scarlet's side.' Another message said: 'Dear Scot, missing you badly mate and you will always be remembered.' One tribute spoke of their 'great memories' with Mr Young, adding that he was 'one in a million'. After the hour-long service, Mr Young's friends and family emerged from the chapel led by Noelle Reno, the star of Bravo's Ladies of London reality TV show. He also appeared in the first season. Mr Young claimed he had lost all his money in a mysterious Russian property deal but she demanded £300million, saying he was worth 'a few billion'. Family funeral: Around 100 people attended the service held at Kensal Green Cemetery this afternoon . Fall: Mr Young, 52, a one-time fixer to the super rich, was found impaled on metal railings outside a luxury flat in Montagu Square, Marylebone (above), in the early evening of December 8 . Mr Young, a friend of Topshop mogul Sir Philip Green and late Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky, was last November ordered to give her a settlement of £20million and £6million in legal costs. He was also sent to prison for refusing to reveal how much money he was worth during the case. After his release, Mr Young became engaged to US fashion designer and TV presenter Miss Reno. But apparently drinking heavily and using cocaine, he spiralled out of control and she split up with him a few months ago. However it is understood he went to Miss Reno's apartment in Marylebone. When she arrived later that day, she found him inside apparently 'manic, crazy and probably high' and she demanded he leave, friends said. She allegedly walked out eventually and called the police to remove him, while he phoned her to threaten he was going to jump out of the window. By the time police arrived, he was dead, impaled on the metal railings outside. Miss Reno said she was 'distraught by the sudden loss of my best friend' and wanted to 'grieve in peace'. Mr Young had previously spoken of his battle with bipolar disorder, for which he was taking prescription medication.","Scot Young, 52, fell 60ft to his death from £3m penthouse on December 8 .

"Prince Charles has suffered more injuries on the polo field than former boxing world champion Amir Khan has sustained in the ring, it has emerged. The Prince of Wales and world-famous boxer swapped tales of their sporting wounds at a recent public event in Sunderland, and discovered that the royal had in fact sustained more injuries than the ex-world light welterweight champion. Prince Charles and Khan were both in the north-east to support a National Citizen Service (NCS) project which enables youngsters to help older people learn about social media. Scroll down for video . Prince Charles and boxing champion Amir Khan discussed their sporting injuries during a public event in Sunderland. It emerged that the royal had suffered more injuries playing polo than Khan had in the ring . The pair (pictured together above with local resident Marta Armstrong) were in Sunderland to support a National Citizen Service project which enables youngsters to help older people learn about social media . Olympic silver medallist Khan said the prince had told him he was a boxing fan which led to them discussing the injuries suffered through the love of their hobbies. Prince Charles, 66, was once a keen polo player and badly broke his right arm in 1990, before being knocked unconscious in a charity match in 2001. He also fractured his shoulder in 2001, broke a rib in 1998 and had six stitches in his left cheek after being kicked by a pony at Windsor in 1980. Meanwhile, Khan, 28, from Bolton, has won 30 of his 33 fights and escaped serious injury in a career which has seen him earn millions. During their meeting, Khan showed the prince a tweet he was sending to his 1.5 million followers across the world about the royal visit. The tweet said: 'Great day with The Prince of Wales seeing the great work @NCS grads are doing #OurFuture #Iwill.' Afterwards, the boxing champion said: 'He is a very nice guy. 'I have met him two or three times before and he seems like a boxing fan. 'We had a bit of a chat about boxing and we had a chat about his polo and how many injuries we'd had. 'He'd had more injuries in that than I have in boxing. It shows you can get injured in all sports.' Prince Charles (pictured having fallen from his horse during a polo match in May 2009) has suffered a broken arm, broken ribs, a fractured shoulder, a cheek injury, back issues and has lost consciousness playing polo . Amir Khan has won 30 out of his 33 fights and has escaped any serious injuries in his career. Pictured: Khan takes a punch from Devon Alexander during the 11th round of their welterweight bout in December last year . During the event at Sunderland's Bethany City Church, Olympic silver medallist Khan told the congregation that he had focused on his sport to succeed. He said schemes such as the NCS, which involves 15-17-year-olds volunteering to help their community, could help others to find their focus. Martha Armstrong, 63, who lives in a complex for retired people in the city centre, said she managed to get introduced to the royal at the meet and greet. She said afterwards: 'We talked about grandchildren, tablets and technology. 'I cannot describe the experience I had - I didn't think I would be introduced to him.' Olympic medallist Khan (pictured left returning to Bolton with his medal after the 2004 Games) said he started discussing injuries with the prince (pictured after a polo match in 1978) after he said he was a boxing fan . Prince Charles is currently on a tour of the northern city and has visited a car plant as well as local schools . Earlier, the prince visited Britain's most productive car plant and saw Nissan Leaf electric cars roll off the line. The plant in Sunderland is the UK's only mass market electric car manufacturer, and it employs 6,700 making a range of models for the Japanese giant. The prince is known for his concern over green issues and fans of electric vehicles say powering them from the grid is 60% cleaner than using conventionally fuelled vehicles. He spoke to children from Gillis Lane Primary School and the Venerable Bede Academy, both in Sunderland, and St Cuthbert's Catholic High School in Newcastle, as well as Nissan apprentices at the plant's Skills Academy. He is a proponent of getting young people involved with industry to boost their employment opportunities and bridge the skills gap. Prince Charles has suffered more injuries on the polo field than Amir Khan has in the boxing ring . During Prince Charles and Olympic silver medallist Amir Khan's meeting, the pair compared the injuries they have each suffered during their lifetime. While 28-year-old Khan has spent his career in a boxing ring, winning 30 out of his 33 fights, the prince, 66, has suffered more injuries on a polo field than the ex-world light welterweight champion. Prince Charles: . 1980: The prince was left needing six stitches in his left cheek after he was thrown from his pony and kicked in the face by the animal during a polo match at Windsor. 1980: Prince Charles collapsed with severe dehydration during a polo match in Florida and had to be put on a saline drip. 1981: The royal was left unable to talk for 10 days after losing his voice when he was hit in the throat during a match. 1990: The Prince of Wales spent three nights in hospital after breaking his right arm in two places after falling from a horse during a match. He later had to return to hospital for another operation to have a metal plate inserted into his arm. 1998: He suffered a broken rib after falling from a horse during a match in North Wales. 1998: The prince underwent keyhole laser surgery to repair damaged cartilage in his right knee. 2001: He was knocked unconscious briefly after falling from a pony, but was given the all-clear at a hospital visit. 2001: The prince fractured his shoulder falling from his horse during a hunt. Prince Charles is also said to suffer from a 'serious degenerative disc problem', with one disc at the base of his spine prolapsed. It is believed to have been caused by several falls from his polo pony. Amir Khan: . Career: The boxing world champion has  suffered cuts, black eyes and severe bruising to his face during his time in the ring. 2001: Freddie Roach, Khan's former trainer, claimed the boxer had suffered a long-term injury but the injury was never revealed or confirmed. 2012: Saj Mohamed, who is part of Khan's support team, claimed the Olympic medallist had fractured both hands during a sparring match.

"An ordinary middle class American family helped inspire much of President Obama's State of the Union address on Tuesday after mother-of-two Rebekah Erler wrote to him last year about how her family continued to struggle following the 2008 economic collapse. Minneapolis native Rebekah was given the honor of being one of Michelle Obama's guest at the event and earlier she had visited the White House along with husband Ben and their two young sons Jack and Henry. During his address, the president repeatedly used the Erlers as an example of a family that had faced hard times following the economic downturn and that continued to struggle to make ends meet despite two working parents. Scroll down for video . Much of the President's State of the Union address on Tuesday was inspired by mother-of-two Rebekah Erler who stood beside Michelle Obama throughout . Before the State of the Union address, the Erler family visited the White House and posed for a selfie . Seven years ago the young couple were newlyweds with Rebekah studying and waiting tables, while Ben owned his own construction company. The couple were also expecting their first child, Jack. 'If only we had known,' Rebekah wrote to the president last spring, 'what was about to happen to the housing and construction market.' As the crisis worsened, Ben's construction business folded and he was forced to take whatever job he could find, even if kept him on the road and away from his family for long stretches of time. A move from Seattle to Minneapolis and several difficult jobs later, Rebekah's husband is now back at work in the re-modeling industry. After taking out student loans to attend a local community college for career re-training, Rebekah has returned to the workforce as an accountant. 'They sacrificed for each other. And slowly, it paid off,' said President Obama, who spent a day with the family in Minnesota last June. President Barack Obama delivers his State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress on Capitol Hill on Tuesday as Vice President Joe Biden applauds and House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio, listen . In her letter to Obama, Erler had written about her husband's struggles to find a reliable job, the high costs of groceries and childcare, and the burden of paying off student loans. The Obama administration has called the Erler’s story one that is 'shared by millions of American families, and helps show that too many middle-class families with two working parents are still stretched too thin.' Both parents are now working again and they recently bought their first home. They have also had a second son, Henry. 'It is amazing,' Rebekah wrote, 'what you can bounce back from when you have to. We are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.' Rebekah was among 22 invited guests who sat with Michelle Obama at Tuesday's State of the Union address. It was Erler’s poignant letter about her family’s financial struggles which prompted Obama to fly to Minnesota last June to met her . In his address, the president said that Rebekah and Ben's story was also America's story. 'They represent the millions who have worked hard, and scrimped, and sacrificed, and retooled,' he said. 'You are the reason I ran for this office. You're the people I was thinking of six years ago today, in the darkest months of the crisis, when I stood on the steps of this Capitol and promised we would rebuild our economy on a new foundation. 'And it's been your effort and resilience that has made it possible for our country to emerge stronger.' Later in his speech the president returned to the Erler family and at the end of his address he also made reference to Rebekah's letter and her description of her family as 'strong' and 'tight-knit'. 'My fellow Americans, we too are a strong, tight-knit family. We, too, have made it through some hard times,' said the president. The Erler family - Ben, Rebekah and their boys Jack and Henry - listen to President Obama talk about the economy while at the Lake Harriet Band Shell in Minneapolis last June . 'Fifteen years into this new century, we have picked ourselves up, dusted ourselves off, and begun again the work of remaking America.' It was Rebekah’s poignant letter about her family’s financial struggles which prompted Obama to fly to Minnesota last June to met her . The  36-year-old accountant and mother of two was invited to join Obama for burgers after writing a letter to the president detailing the challenges she and her husband continue to face in reaping the benefits of a recovery from recession that so far has disproportionately benefited those at the top of the income scale. 'We actually have something to offer that young lady,' Obama at a fundraiser for House Democrats in Minneapolis hours after meeting with her. 'And if she wins, then the country wins, and our kids and our grandkids win.' Mom-of-two Rebekah Erler was among 22 invited guests who sat with Michelle Obama at Tuesday's State of the Union address .","Much of President Obama's State of the Union address on Tuesday was inspired by a letter from mother-of-two Rebekah Erler .

"Ministry of Defence officials are secretly examining plans to slash the size of the army by a quarter, a former defence minister has revealed. Sir Nick Harvey said the department was drawing up proposals which would see 20,000 troops axed – taking the size of the army to just 60,000 regular soldiers. The army has already been cut from 102,000 regular soldiers to 82,000, but further cuts may be needed to cope with the impending ‘financial crunch’ faced by the MoD, Sir Nick said. Former Defence Minister Sir Nick Harvey said the MoD was drawing up proposals which would see 20,000 troops axed – taking the size of the army to just 60,000 regular soldiers . The Lib Dem defence spokesman, speaking in the Commons during a debate on Trident renewal, said: ‘There are already paper exercises going on in looking at what an army of just 60,000 would look like because of the financial crunch that the department is going to be facing.’ He told MPs that several areas of the UK's military would need to be replaced in the coming years – but warned defence spending could drop towards 1.5 per cent of national income. Sir Nick questioned why the renewal of the country's Trident nuclear deterrent was receiving an ‘automatic bye’. He claimed the cost of buying, operating and decommissioning new submarines for the Trident nuclear deterrent could cost more than £100 billion over 30 years. Sir Nick told the Commons: ‘We know that the national deficit remains a serious problem. ‘We do not hear from any of the political parties - not mine, nor anybody else's - that defence is going to be insulated or protected from a tough comprehensive spending review later this year. ‘If defence was to face another cut comparable to that which it took in 2010, which seems to me entirely possible, then the proportion of our gross domestic product that we are spending on defence - which is already destined to go below 2 per cent next year - will make rapid headway towards 1.5 per cent of GDP.' Defence Secretary Michael Fallon (left) and British Army head Sir Peter Wall (right) face further military cuts after the next election . Sir Nick criticised the decision to push ahead with the maintenance of Britain's nuclear deterrent. He said: ‘For some reason, keeping a nuclear deterrent going at the level we thought was necessary at the height of the Cold War in 1980 gets an automatic bye and is just assumed to be beyond debate. ‘Nobody even wants to put it on the table and debate it alongside these other things that are there to mitigate the threats we really face, the dangers which our own security assessment in 2010 said are first league threats that we really face here and now.’ On Trident, Sir Nick said any new submarines should be capable of carrying out other functions as well as providing a nuclear deterrent. He said: ‘I do not believe that it makes any sense whatever for us to be sailing the high seas 24/7 waving weapons of mass destruction at the rest of the world because we thought it was necessary in 1980 or because we have made a £30billion investment, which we think would leave us looking embarrassed if we didn't do it.’","Ex minister Sir Nick Harvey said  proposals drawn up to axe 20,000 troops .

"Two nurses and an orderly dragged a mentally disabled man from his bed and beat him so severely that he will be paralysed for life if he survives. CCTV footage shows the horrific moment the hospital staff kicked Zhao Yanli in his bed, before pulling him onto the floor and stamping on his head. The patient was then moved to the television room at the psychiatric hospital in the city of Shenyang in north-eastern China's Liaoning province where he was found by his brother, Cheng. Scroll down for video . CCTV: Footage shows Zhao Yanli being kicked in his bed, before being dragged onto the floor and stamped on . Bruised: Zhao was found injured and barely conscious in the television room by his brother Cheng . 'I asked where he was and they told me he was in the TV room,' Cheng said. 'When I went there I found him barely conscious and covered in bruises. He was in a really bad way.' Zhao was immediately taken to the emergency ward at the local hospital but medics said there was little they could do for him. They said it appeared he is crippled and would probably never have the use of his legs again if he survived. The footage was caught on a CCTV camera seized by police as part of an investigation into the horrific injuries that Zhao sustained. It is believed the attack was in response to an offensive comment Zhao apparently made to a female nurse, which had offended her honour. His family is now suing Shenyang People’s Military Psychiatric Hospital, not only for allowing the staff to beat the mentally disabled man so severely, but also for failing to alert them to the injuries, meaning they missed the opportunity to get him immediate medical attention. The family complained to police shortly after taking him to hospital in November and officers subsequently raided the hospital and seized the CCTV footage. Attack: The CCTV footage of the assault was seized by police as part of the investigation into the man's injuries . Offensive: It is believed the attack was in response to an offensive comment Zhao apparently made to a nurse . At least 10 other people seem to be in the room. Although it is not known if these are staff or patients, it is clear none of them tried to protect the mentally ill patient. The family has hired a lawyer after refusing to accept the £37,000 in compensation offered by the hospital. They said they also want to see the staff prosecuted and jailed. Cheng added: 'We put my beloved brother there because we wanted him to be well cared for in a way that we didn't have time for a home, and we were shocked to find this sort of abuse happening. 'He is a good man who would never harm anybody, I can't believe he got a beating like this for apparently saying something rude to a female nurse.'

"Television weatherman Fred Talbot used his 'boundless energy' and 'extrovert personality' to help gain the affection and trust of five schoolboys he sexually abused, a jury has heard. Talbot, 65, is said to have indecently assaulted his victims between the late 1960s and the early 1980s during his former career as a teacher. Four of the complainants were teenage pupils at Altrincham Grammar School for Boys, where Talbot taught biology. TV weatherman Fred Talbot (pictured arriving at court on Tuesday) used his 'boundless energy' and 'extrovert personality' to help gain the affection and trust of five schoolboys he sexually abused, a jury has heard . Opening the case at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court, prosecutor Neil Usher said: 'The very qualities that made Fred Talbot so successful as a TV celebrity - his boundless energy, his infectious enthusiasm, his extrovert personality - helped him gain, we say, the trust of these boys. 'Trust, which the prosecution say, Mr Talbot repeatedly abused when, away from their parents on school trips organised by Mr Talbot, he sexually assaulted each of them. 'We say that when it came to teenage boys in his care, Fred Talbot was something of a 'chancer'. 'One of these men who regularly and repeatedly tries it on with his intended victim as often as he can in the hope that his sexual advances will not be rejected. 'Or, at the very least, the sexual advances will be met by a passive response due to confusion, fear, intoxication or youthful inexperience of how to react when being placed in such an unusual, shocking and, no doubt on occasion, frightening position. 'And we say that like many child abusers who are in a position of authority who are confident and who are plainly well liked by their peers, he gambled that each of the boys he took advantage of would find it impossible to speak out and tell other adults what he had done, either through fear of not being believed or because it would inevitably involve speaking to parents or other teachers about embarrassing matters of a sexual, indeed homosexual, nature.' Talbot, of Bowdon, Greater Manchester, who was a regular on the floating weather map in Liverpool's Albert Dock for ITV's top-rating This Morning show, denies 10 counts of indecent assault. The jury of nine women and three men were told that many if not all of them would know the defendant as 'Fred the Weatherman'. He had appeared on local and national television since the mid-1980s until recently, and has appeared in various other ITV programmes, the court heard. A prosecuting lawyer said 'the qualities that made Fred Talbot successful as a TV celebrity - his boundless energy - helped him gain the boys' trust'. The accused is pictured while presenting on ITV's This Morning . Outlining the allegations, Mr Usher said they centred around two distinct periods of time - firstly when Talbot was a trainee teacher in Newcastle in the late 1960s and early 1970s and secondly from the mid-70s to 1984 when Talbot taught in Altrincham. The prosecutor said Talbot says nothing sexual or even inappropriate occurred between himself and the Altrincham pupils, while he states that sexual activity with the complainant during his teacher training only happened when the boy turned 16. The latter complainant said he first met Talbot when he visited his school in Gateshead and was someone who came from a very poor background and had limited life experiences. Mr Usher said: 'Meeting Mr Talbot meant he was able to go places and do things and meet people he would never have been able to had the defendant not taken him under his wing.' Within weeks, the boy was invited to visit Talbot at his accommodation and it later led to the pair sharing a bed with Talbot 'pushing and manoeuvring himself against him' in a sexual manner, he said. It was the boy's first sexual experience, added Mr Usher, which left him very confused. There were more overnight visits Talbot 'gained in confidence and stepped up his sexual advances', said the prosecutor. The court heard that the complainant is clear that the defendant never forced himself upon him but described Talbot coaxing him into letting perform sexual acts on him. On one occasion he recalled, when still aged 15, he went to a ball at Talbot's teacher training college with a girl and later the defendant unzipped this trousers and performed oral sex on him outside. The next complainant claimed he was sexually assaulted by Talbot in the mid-1970s on a barge during a canal trip organised by Altrincham Boys Grammar School. He said Talbot was the teacher in charge and each night one of the schoolboys had to sleep in a double bed with him as there were not enough bunk beds for everyone. Talbot sexually assaulted him in the bed, he alleges. Mr Usher said the teenager was one of a number of former pupils who described how Talbot managed to gain their trust and affection. Talbot (left), of Bowdon, Greater Mancehster denied 10 counts of indecent assault . He said: 'He said that he was good at befriending you, making you feel like he was your mate, a friend more than a teacher. An approach the prosecution says was quite deliberate on the part of Mr Talbot, given his objective of gaining the trust of these boys.' The third complainant said he too was indecently assaulted in the mid-1970s by Talbot in his double bed on the barge during a weekend canal trip. He said he was drunk after Talbot took older boys to the pub and later brought beer back to the boat. Mr Usher said: 'He recalls Mr Talbot suggesting that some of the boys pretend to be girls so that they could, as he put it, have an ""orgy"" which had to be kept secret. He recalls the boys and Mr Talbot all taking their clothes off and rolling around.' The jury heard that this complainant previously contacted police in 1992, 1996 and 1998 to say that Talbot had sexually abused him but the defendant denied the allegations and police decided there was insufficient evidence to prosecute. The alleged victim admitted that when he went back to the police in 1996, he exaggerated the events of the sexual abuse in frustration at the case not going forward, Mr Usher said. The fourth complainant said he was drinking in a pub local to Talbot when he and some of his friends were invited back to the defendant's home. The then-16-year-old said he went to the toilet and Talbot came up behind him and said 'I can do that for you' and grabbed hold of his penis. Mr Usher said this was yet another example of the defendant 'trying it on' with a teenage boy to whom he was plainly sexually attracted. The final complainant said he too was aged 16 when he and a friend went to a party at Talbot's home in Bowdon. He recalled that they knocked on the door and Talbot greeted them completely naked. Talbot went on to get dressed and during the evening indecently assaulted the youngster in his living room while the pair were alone, the court heard. The court heard that Talbot's teaching career came to 'an abrupt end' in 1984 following an incident involving a pupil at his home. Talbot, who also taught astronomy, had invited a number of boys to stay over as 'there was a particular alignment of planets expected on that night and the defendant had a telescope at home'. One of the boys said during the evening he was propositioned by Talbot who asked him if he could perform a sex act on him, said the prosecutor. The youngster politely declined and said there was nothing he could do that his girlfriend could not do for him. Talbot is then said to have remarked: 'I think you'll find I can.' He also told the youngster and another boy who were intending to stay the night to 'make sure you leave room for me in the middle'. The boy told his father who rang the defendant to complain, said Mr Usher. The prosecutor said Talbot offered to discuss the matter but before he had the opportunity the school's headteacher informed the boy's father that Talbot would not be coming round and had resigned with immediate affect. A diary entry written by Talbot, said to be in relation to the above incident , said: 'As usual I had quite a bit to drink, as usual I tried. I must be mad.' Mr Usher said the defendant was out of work following his sudden departure from school and his career in television took off some time later. The police investigation into Talbot in 2012 came following publicity into an unrelated sex abuse probe at St Ambrose College, another school in the Altrincham area. A woman rang detectives to say a friend of hers had been sexually abused by Talbot as a pupil, which led to police locating one of the complainants who told them he was indeed a victim. Police went on track down the alleged victim who had made three complaints previously about the defendant, while the others came forward as a result of publicity of Talbot's arrest. The prosecutor said Talbot offered 'no comment' when he was spoken to by police and formally interviewed under caution. Talbot, of Bowdon, Greater Mancehster, who was a regular on the floating weather map in Liverpool's Albert Dock for ITV's top-rating This Morning show, denies 10 counts of indecent assault.

"Just one district in Britain has seen its proportion of migrants fall in the last decade. The percentage of the population from abroad in Dorset's Isle of Purbeck - a rural peninsula near Poole - was 0.9 per cent lower in 2011 than in 2001, despite rising everywhere else. In some parts of the country the proportion of migrants in the general population doubled, the report found, and in two areas it more than tripled, according to an Oxford University report. Rural: Dorset's Isle of Purbeck features Corfe Castle (pictured), retirement cottages, holiday homes... and the status of the only district in Britain where the proportion of migrants fell between 2001 and 2011 . The biggest increase was in Boston, Lincolnshire, where the proportion of migrants almost quintupled from 3 per cent to 15 per cent of the town's residents. And in Merthyr Tydil, South Wales, the proportion of migrants rose from 1.4 per cent to 4.5 per cent. The figures were compiled by the Migration Observatory, a body based at the Centre on Migration, Policy and Society at Oxford University. Experts looked at the changes in Britain's make-up between the 2001 census and the 2011 census. Although London still has by far the highest proportion of migrants per head of population, the biggest increases were almost all outside the capital. Hull, Wrexham and Aberdeen were among the biggest changers, with all seeing the proportion of migrants in the population more than double. Increase: Boston, Lincolnshire, has seen its proportion of migrants increase from 3 per cent to 15 per cent . Purbeck was the only place where the proportion of migrants fell, but even there, the actual number rose - by eight people. The rural area is popular with tourists and has become a hotspot for holiday homes and retirement cottages, driving up the price of houses for everyone else. Most of Purbeck is made up of woods and fields and it features Corfe Castle, a former fortress which was partially demolished in the English Civil War. Nathan Gadenne, director of Booth & Co estate agents in Wareham, Purbeck's largest town, said: 'There's two reasons behind the low number of migrants. 'The first is income - I would expect many new migrants aren't earning enough to pay what are the higher rents that we seem to have. 'The rents are pushed up by the high number of second homes and retirement homes. A lot of our clients are cash buyers looking to settle down in the area for a quiet life. Gradual change: The figures provided by the Migration Observatory at Oxford University coincided with a report by the same body, which looked at the rise in Britain's migrant population in the past 20 years (above) Population: 45,200 . Average age: 45 . Cost of detached home: £410,000 . Average full-time wages: £24,000 . Unemployment: 4.1% . Top-rated tourist sight: Swanage Railway . Population: 58,100 . Average age: 42 . Cost of detached home: £184,000 . Average full-time wages: £22,600 . Unemployment: 5.4% . Top-rated tourist sight: Bubblecar Museum . 'The second reason is the number of jobs. Migrants would want to move somewhere that's got good job prospects and a lot of work here is seasonal - although we do get some workers in the hospitality industry.' In Boston, high levels of migration have helped the 55,000-strong population of 2001 rise by around 10,000. The town's Tory MP Mark Simmonds has led a campaign to win more government funding for the area, whose migration figures were described as unique in a Home Office report last year. The rankings coincide with a report yesterday by the Migration Observatory which examined changes to Britain's make-up over the past 20 years. 'The share of foreign-born people in the UK’s total population increased by over 50 per cent between 1993 and 2013,' the report said. Data: London still has by far the highest proportion of foreign-born citizens overall compared to other areas . 'The UK population was 12.5 per cent foreign-born and 8 per cent non-British citizens in 2013.' The report included England, Wales and Scotland, but not Northern Ireland, because of the number of people crossing the border from the Republic of Ireland who count as EU migrants. The top four countries sending people to Britain were India, Pakistan, Poland and Ireland. Germany, South Africa, the U.S., Nigeria, Bangladesh, Italy, Romania and Lithuania all featured high on the list, which looked at both nationality and country of birth. Some 13 per cent of all migrants are now Polish nationals, higher than any other country. Polish nationals have been free to live and work in Britain since the country joined the EU in 2004. 1.

"A health care worker returning from Sierra Leone has sparked a new Ebola scare in the US after she was pulled off a United Airlines flight in Newark and rushed to the hospital on Monday. The woman, whose name has not been released, reportedly vomited aboard United flight 45 from Brussels and suffered from a high fever - both early signs of the deadly disease. She is currently at Hackensack University Medical Center, undergoing tests for Ebola - though doctors said she no longer had a fever when she arrived at the hospital and is no longer showing signs of infection. Scroll down for video . Health workers in hazmat suits met the passenger on the plane at Newark Liberty International Airport on Monday afternoon . The woman was taken off and sent to Hackensack University Medical Center, whe she was tested for Ebola and was being held on Tuesday . The woman is reportedly a health worker who was returning from the Ebola-afflicted nation of Sierra Leone in West Africa . She was being kept at the hospital on Tuesday 'in an abundance of caution.' The Bergen County Record reports that the woman was returning to the US from Sierra Leone, a West African nation where health workers are still working to bring Ebola under control. The virus has infected an estimated 10,000 people there and killed more than 3,000. Passengers told the Record that healthcare workers in hazmat suits met the plane when it landed about 2pm on Monday. E.E. Charlton-Trujillo, who was on the flight, said neither airline officials nor health authorities offered an explanation for what happened on the plane, but fear quickly spread through the cabin. 'Everyone’s thinking Ebola,' she told the Record. They took the woman off the flight and then had the remaining 261 passengers and crew members fill out health care forms and gave them contact numbers for public health officials. Authorities stressed that even if the woman tests positive for Ebola, it's highly unlikely that she would have infected anyone else aboard. Doctors say the woman no longer had a fever when she arrived at Hackensack University Medical Center . Passengers were given health forms to fill out and told the contact health officials if they experienced any symptoms of the virus . Flight: Luke Punzenberger, a spokesman for United said that a passenger had become ill on a flight that arrived in Newark from Brussels on Monday afternoon . Luke Punzenberger, a spokesman for United said that a passenger had become ill on a flight that arrived in Newark from Brussels on Monday afternoon. He told CNN: 'After arriving at Newark airport from Brussels, medical personnel met a United flight to assist an ill passenger on board. 'Passengers and crew stayed on the plane until the medical personnel cleared the aircraft.' As of this month, the World Health Organization says at least 8,594 people have died in the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. In Liberia there were 3,587 deaths. Sierra Leone had 3,132 deaths and Guinea 1,875 deaths. The current outbreak, which began about a year ago, has also claimed more than a dozen lives elsewhere. The death toll from the current Ebola outbreak has reached 8,594 people with as many as 21,614 infected according to the World Health Organization. It describes Ebola symptoms as the sudden onset of fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. This is followed by vomiting, diarrhea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding. The infection is transmitted by direct contact with the blood, bodily fluids and tissues of infected animals or people. And people remain infectious as long as their blood and secretions contain the virus. There is no known cure or vaccine for the disease but the incubation period is two to 21 days. A burial team from the Liberian health department removes the body of a woman suspected of dying of the Ebola virus, the African country has reported the highest numbers of deaths from the virus .

"An Alzheimer's sufferer hoping to visit Gallipoli to honour his late war veteran father has been told he will be stripped of his disability pension if he travels to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the ANZAC landings. Pat Nichols was ecstatic when his name was pulled out of a ballot to go to Turkey  but his elation was short-lived once he discovered he wouldn't receive his disability pension throughout the six-week trip. The devastating news came as the Federal Government changed the laws on January 1 to prevent disability pensioners to receive the allowance while living overseas. Scroll down for video . Pat Nichols won a chance to visit Gallipoli to pay tribute to his late war veteran father but he will be stripped of his disability pension if he takes the trip to fulfill his lifelong dream under new government laws . Samuel Nichols (pictured), who died 53 years ago when Pat was a young boy, fought in both World War I and II . Pat couldn't believe that taking the holiday would be determined as living overseas. 'This is just ridiculous when you can't spend - even if it is six weeks of time- just to honour your father,' he told A Current Affair. Samuel Nichols, who died 53 years ago when Pat was a young boy, fought in both World War I and II, and his son has always wanted to pay his respects to his father. 'Our fathers fought for freedom - this is not freedom - this is picking on the vulnerable people,' he said. Although Pat and his wife, June, have been saving for years for the trip in April - if they don't received the pension while they are away - it will break the bank. The couple can apply for an exemption but there is no guarantee it will be granted. Federal Disability Services Minister, Scott Morrison, said the department has offered the couple assistance with that application and process. 'There are some clear rules here that have to be followed - you have to have one rule for everyone if you're going to have a system that's fair,' he said. 'When you have a generous system of supporting people with disabilities you need to have strong rules to ensure that it's always protected.' Pat  is suffering from Alzheimer's therefore it is likely to be his last chance to honour his father at Gallipoli . Pat and his wife, June, are still determined to go on the trip despite the financial hardship they will face . Pat was  forced to retire as a factory worker in May last year and he has had a slow and steady decline but receiving the heartbreaking news has made his condition worse. June said time was running out for the couple as her husband's memory deteriorated. 'Life was going along pretty sweet for us and then he was diagnosed and suddenly all of the plans and dreams and hopes you had for the future - you know that they are all gone,' she said. Despite the financial blow, the couple are determined to still go on the trip as doctors said it is likely to be Pat's last chance to honour his dad. 'I was lucky my father came home but to be able to got to Gallipoli and honour him and go to some of the countries that he fought in during that war is just my last dream,' Pat said. 'Gallipoli means everything to me at the moment because it might be my last chance to get to Gallipoli on the 100th anniversary where all of those Australian soldiers fought and died. 'It's what it means to people not because you just want to save a dollar - this is not what Australia is all about.'

"Police say a New York man was arrested on Monday for renting a bulldozer and demolishing his own home, which actually legally belonged to his wife. James Rhein, 48, of Middleton, was arrested on a felony charge of criminal mischief after knocking down the Woodland Ave property with an excavator. Rhein said the house had been in disrepair for years and that he went to get a permit to pull it down, however the office was shut for Martin Luther King Day. So he decided to demolish it himself - all 840-square-feet of the ranch-style, one-story home, according to NBC New York. Arrested: James Rhein, 48, used an excavator to knock down his 840-square-foot ranch-style home at 11 Woodland, Middletown, and deposited the debris into dumpsters . Demolished: This photo shows the scene of a home that was torn down in Middletown on Monday, after a man hired a bulldozer and demolished it himself . Police were notified as to what was going on and arrived to find Rhein all but finished the job. Utility companies were not notified of the demolition, which resulted in emergency callouts for termination of electric, water and gas. Rhein was putting the debris into dumpsters when authorities arrived. No one was injured as a result of the incident. Police said additional charges may be pending. Afterwards, Rhein admitted to NBC4 New York that his wife - whose name is on the deed of the home - did not know what he was doing. Not anymore: James Rhein, of Middletown, is facing second-degree felony charges for allegedly using an excavator to knock down his wife's house while his wife was running errands .

"Home to more than half of the world's wild tigers, India today reported that the tiger population has jumped by 30 per cent over the last four years. A census counted 2,226 tigers in India last year compared with 1,706 in 2010, officials in New Delhi announced. Environment minister Prakash Javadekar hailed the rise as a 'huge success' as India battles to save the endangered animals from poachers and smugglers as well as the destruction of their natural habitat. Scroll down for video . Today's census found 2,226 tigers in India last year compared with 1,706 in 2010 - an increase of 30 per cent . Environment minister Prakash Javadekar cited improved management of India's more than 40 tiger reserves for the increase. Ranthambore National Park in Rajasthan (pictured above) is famous for its tigers . He said: 'While the tiger population is falling in the world, it is rising in India. We have increased by 30 per cent from the last count. That is a huge success story.' The minister cited improved management of India's more than 40 tiger reserves for the increase. Tigers have been threatened by rampant poaching and shrinking habitats from deforestation caused by power projects, roads and human settlements as the country pushes ahead with rapid industrialization and economic development. The disappearance of forests has affected the availability of prey and led tigers to stray into human habitats. Javadekar said the government was working to reduce deadly encounters between tigers and villagers, as farmers encroached on forest land and the big cats left reserves to search for water and food. Javadekar said the government was working to reduce deadly encounters between tigers and villagers . An estimated 9,700 hidden cameras were used in known tiger habitats including in the northeast state of Assam and western Rajasthan to take photographs of the animals for the census. Officials said they surveyed nearly 380,000 sq km of forest area in 18 states. Parks including Pench, Kanha, Bandavgarh, Panna, Corbett National Park and Ranthambhore National Park are open during the months of October to April - the autumn and winter seasons in India. During these months, viewing tigers and other wildlife is possible but the landscape changes rapidly during this period. Source: Travel Operators for Tigers . 'Never before has such an exercise been taken. 'We have unique photographs of 80 per cent of the tigers in the wild', Javadekar said. India's conservation programme has been working to halt their decline. The numbers have been rising since hitting a low of 1,411 in 2006 but the current population still remains a long way off 2002 when around 3,700 tigers were estimated to be alive in the country. There were thought to be around 40,000 tigers in India at the time of independence from Britain in 1947. Authorities across Asia are waging a major battle against poachers who often sell tiger body parts to the lucrative traditional Chinese medicine market.","Number of tigers living in India rose from 1,706 in 2010 to 2,226 in 2014 .

New York City-based fashion executive Thomas Trube Bourne, 44, who married model, dancer and SoulCycle instructor Eric Trube Bourne, 29,  in May last year, says they never anticipated such a huge response when they shot the ad. Meet the Trube Bournes: New York City-based newlyweds Eric (left) and Thomas (right) married in May last year, and not long afterwards were cast in a Tiffany & Co ad . Love story: Thomas (left) and Eric (right) are the stars of the new Tiffany & Co 'Will You' campaign, as they are the first same-sex couple to represent the brand . 'I was a bit overwhelmed seeing our faces on every TV channel,' he told Daily Mail Online. 'We never expected this. It was just a fun thing we did. Now having details about ourselves and our relationship in the public is very exposing and freeing at the same time.' In fact, even the timing was something of a surprise, he added: 'The ad was leaked early so the actual campaign has not been released yet.' Eric reveals that he and his husband landed a meeting with Tiffany & Co's casting director through his agent. 'They asked us about our relationship, how we got engaged and we got the job,' he told Mlive.com. The ad sees the couple posing on the steps of a brownstone in Manhattan's West Village - a setting not unlike Carrie Bradshaw's famous stoop. Authentic: Eric says that he and Thomas were the only real couple to appear in the series of ads . Fashion moment: The couple, pictured in November 2014 at an event at the Guggenheim Museum, were photographed by legendary photographer Peter Lindbergh for the Tiffany campaign . The black-and-white photo, taken by legendary fashion photographer Peter Lindbergh, shows the two men smiling, arms interlinked. It is positioned beside a photo of two men's wedding rings and the words: 'Will you?' The small print alongside the image reads: 'Will you promise to never stop completing my sentences or singing off-key, which I'm afraid you do often? And will you let today be the first sentence of one long story that never, ever ends?' The other six ads in the series play on the 'Will You?' theme, though the focus is on women's diamond wedding and engagement rings. Eric says that as far as he is aware, he and Thomas were the only real couple to appear in the series of ads, the others feature top models posing as couples - Andreea Diaconu, Joséphine Le Tutour, Luca Gadjus and Cora Emmanuel among them. And his relationship's authenticity is an aspect of the ad that he is most proud of. 'I think that's what makes this so special,' he said. 'The campaign is all about the nontraditional marriage and how love and marriage follows its own journey. To be part of that is really exciting.' Tiffany & Co spokeswoman Linda Buckley told CNN that the two men were chosen for the campaign because they are a real-life couple. 'Nowadays, the road to marriage is no longer linear,' she told the network. 'True love can happen more than once with love stories coming in a variety of forms.' Celebrating love: The other six ads in the series play on the 'Will You?' theme, though the focus is on women's diamond wedding and engagement rings . Romantic: A Tiffany & Co rep says the campaign is all about  how love and marriage follows its own journey . For Eric and Thomas, their relationship developed in a relatively straightforward way. They met at a Christmas party in December 2011, dated and moved in together. The wedding, in May 2014, was a whim, according to Mlive.com: 'One morning, they woke up and decided to go to City Hall and marry each other.' The campaign was met with overwhelmingly positive feedback. But Tiffany & Co, known for its blue boxes, is far from the first to take such a step. In some regards they are a few years late. J. Crew broke the mold in 2011 when it featured one of their designers and his partner in a catalog. Gap erected a billboard emblazoned with a same-sex couple the following year. Banana Republic did the same thing in 2014, and in February last year, Barney's New York used 17 transgender men and women for its ad campaign.","Eric and Thomas Trube Bourne made headlines across the globe last week when the new Tiffany & Co ad was leaked .

"A man arrested shortly after gunshots were fired near Vice President Joe Biden's Delaware home says police officers beat him up. Rock Peters, 57, of Hockessin says New Castle County Police officers left him with a swollen nose, rib injuries, cuts on his face and a black eye. 'They beat the daylights out of me,' Peters told the News Journal. Photos that Peters says he took of himself afterward show his face covered with blood and bruises. Bloody: Rock Peters says police in Delaware bloodied his face after stopping him in the wake of their investigation into a shooting outside VP Joe Biden's private residence . 'They're lying through their teeth': Despite a damning police report, Peters says the police were the aggressors in his traffic stop and even likens himself to the unarmed New York man strangled by NYPD Eric Garner . Police documents say Peters fled from an officer near the Biden estate in Wilmington shortly after Saturday's shooting and scuffled with two officers. The News Journal reports that Peters is not charged in the shooting. However, he does face charges of reckless endangering and resisting arrest. The police report claims the officers were about to let him walk away but he then yelled something at them and sped off, nearly hitting an officer. When he was pulled over again, police say Peters reached into a jacket pocket and they feared he was reaching for a gun. The scuffle soon ensued, but Peters says the lead up went nothing like what the officers described. 'They're lying through their teeth,' he told the News Journal. 'And that point, without saying a word, he cold-cocked me,' Peters recalled, and put a 'death chokehold on me. I thought I was going to die right there.' Police have charged Peters with resisting arrest but he says he did no such thing . 'And that point, without saying a word, he cold-cocked me,' Peters recalled, and put a 'death chokehold on me. I thought I was going to die right there.' Multiple gunshots were fired from a vehicle near Biden's Delaware home Saturday night. A man pulled over during a subsequent investigation claims he was brutally beaten by officers . A security official stands at the end of the driveway leading to Vice President Joe Biden's home Sunday . The shots were fired on a road a few hundred yards from the Biden home (pictured). Secret Service agents said the incident occurred outside a secured area . Peters says he then yelled, 'I can't breathe to the police.' 'Same thing that happened to Eric Garner, happened to me,' he said. 'It was deja vu all over again.' Peters said he was taken to an area hospital to be treated and then to the police station. At the station, Peters says his girlfriend took photos of his injuries. Police on Tuesday had yet to comment on Peters' allegations. Shots rang out Saturday night outside the Delaware home of Vice President Joe Biden. Multiple rounds were fired from a vehicle speeding past the New Castle County residence around 8:25pm, according to the Secret Service. 'This occurred on a public road outside the established security perimeter. The shots were heard by Secret Service personnel posted at the residence and a vehicle was observed by an agent leaving the scene at a high rate of speed,' Secret Service spokesman Robert Hoback told CNN. The Vice President and his physician wife were expected to be in Delaware over the weekend, but were not home during the incident, officials said. Shots fired: Mulitple shots were fired from a speeding vehicle outside Joe and Jill Biden's private home in Delaware Saturday night . According to CBS News, the couple was 'out for the evening.' The Secret Service informed them of the shooting and promised a thorough search of the grounds. The shots were fired several hundred yards from the home. The road lies outside a perimeter secured by Secret Service. According to the New York Times, New Castle County police and Secret Service agents were unable to catch the shooter as he or she sped away. 'The Secret Service is working closely with the New Castle County Police on investigating this incident,' Edwin Donovan, a spokesman for the Secret Service, told the Times. Biden's neighborhood includes stately stone-and-brick homes along a curving two-lane road that winds through rolling hills. Nestled in a heavily wooded area, the vice president's home is not visible from the main road. A small cottage, occupied by the Secret Service, sits on the property near a gate in front of the driveway that is blocked off by Secret Service vehicles and personnel. Police said there was a report of shots fired in the nearby area of Hoopes Reservoir, just northwest of the Biden home. The reservoir is a source of fresh water for Wilmington. Biden's office said the vice president and his wife, Jill Biden, were briefed Saturday night, as was President Barack Obama. Biden's office referred all other questions to the Secret Service.","Rock Peters, 57, was arrested 30 minutes after shots were fired from a vehicle on a road near the vice president's Delaware private residence .

"Congresswoman Gwen Moore is bringing 400 yellow pencils – unsharpened 0 to Tuesday night's State of the Union address, hoping to spark a bipartisan show of support for free speech in the wake of the the January 7 Islamist massacre of journalists in Paris. The shooting attack by jihadis – angered by cartoon depictions of the Muslim prophet Muhammad – killed 11 and left 11 more injured. Moore 's spokesman said Tuesday that Congress has an opportunity to condemn it with one voice and defend the concept of free speech. The Wisconsin Democrat 'will hold up a yellow pencil' at selected points during Presdient Barack Obama's annual speech 'to honor those who lost their lives in the pursuit of open ideas and free expression,' Eric Harris told DailyMail.com. And she wants everyone gathered in the House chamber to join her. Scroll down for video . Wisconsin Democratic Rep. Gwen Moore (center) hopes to spark a statement in defense of Charlie Hebdo on Tuesday night during President Barack Obama's State of the union Address . YELLOW PENCIL: The writing implement has become a symbol of free expression across Europe, and Moore will bring 400 of them to the House cahmber on Tuesday . 'I hope it's hundreds. We've invited all our Republican colleagues,' Harris added in a phone interview. 'The congresswoman will have pencils with her on the floor. We're bringing 400.' There are 534 members of Congress, including the 100 senators who will shoehorn themselves into the crowded hall. (One House seat remains vacant after former New York Rep. Michael Grimm's resignation.) Members of the Supreme Court and most of the president's Cabinet secretaries will also attend, along with Vice President Joe Biden, first lady Michelle Obama and selected guests. The Moore aide said at 4:00 that nearly three dozen members of Congress had confirmed they would be participating. Harris explained that French citizens have turned ordinary pencils into protest implements in the weeks since the writers of the Charlie Hebdo satire magazine lost their lives. Holding a pencil above ones head is now an internationally recognized disapproval of censorship. From Paris to Barcelona to London, pencils lifted skyward have carried a message of support for what Charlie Hebdo stands for – an irreverent and unapologetic mocking tone toward anyone and anything of importance. 'We'd like to do it every time the president refers to the victims, and every time he refers to freedom of speech or expression,' he said. Obama is expected to mention the Paris attacks at least once Tuesday night. Separately, the House of Representatives passed a resolution on Tuesday officially condemning the Charlie Hebdo attack and a separate deadly act of terror at a Paris kosher supermarket. 'Seventeen innocents lost their lives, and this resolution carries our condolences to their loved ones,' House Speaker John Boehner said in a statement. 'With this condemnation also comes a commitment to stand with France and our allies in confronting the grave threat radical Islam poses to our security and way of life,' he said. WHERE WAS POTUS? A January 11 rally of millions in Paris went off without President Barack Obama, who was reportedly watching football; he will likely try to express his solidarity in his State of the Union address . ERASERS: Muslims in Pakistan and elsewhere have rallied to condemn the Paris magazine for showing cartoons oMuhammad . EUROPEAN UNION: As far away as the UK and Turkey – this woman demonstrated in Ankara – people have held pencils aloft to signify the defense of free expression in the face of religious extremism . Moore's spokesman was more circumspect about seeing her pencil protest as a statement about religion. 'The gesture is not meant to insult Muslims nor is it an attack on Islam,' Harris insisted in a followup email. He framed his boss's concerns in the same language Obama uses – condemning 'the threat of violent extremism' – without touching the liberal third-rail of casting suspicion on Islam itself. The idea for a pencil protest began as a Democrats-only stunt, passed in secret from press secretary to press secretary. Then an email from Harris to his colleagues was leaked to National Journal. Suddenly it was a bipartisan idea, open to both sides of the aisle. 'This is something we just planned to do privately, and then it would just be a surprise during the State of the Union,' Harris told DailyMail.com. 'But because my email was leaked – that's just how it goes.' 'I should have just put ""confidential"" on top of it,' he joked, 'and made sure it leaked in about ten seconds.'","Rep.

"French police have been accused of 'beating' British-bound migrants living rough in Calais. A highly critical report by Human Rights Watch claims refugees are subjected to 'harassment and abuse' on the streets of the northern French port. There are an estimated 2,500 illegal immigrants in Calais all hoping to sneak across the Channel to Britain. Accusation: Migrants in Calais, pictured, are being subjected to 'harassment and abuse' by local police, according to a report by Human Rights Watch . The report by the global organisation said it interviewed eight people who suffered broken bones caused by the police, and another 21 who were sprayed with tear gas. Flare-ups have occurred in recent months between the rising . number of migrants, who try to sneak into cargo trucks passing . into Britain, and security forces. Last September, hundreds of . migrants protested what they said was police violence. In the wake of clashes, French and British authorities . announced heightened security measures, but a shelter pledged by . the French government for 1,500 migrants and asylum seekers to . open by January is not yet fully functional, HRW said. Human Rights Watch said: 'Asylum seekers and migrants living in the poverty in the port city of Calais are victims of harassment and abuse by French police. 'Nineteen people, including two children said that police had abused them at least once, including through beatings. Help: Migrants receive hot food from the association 'La Vie Active' in Calais on January 15, at the site where a new day center for migrants was opened which should be able to accommodate 1,500 migrants a day . 'Eight were left with broken limbs or other visible injuries, which according to them were caused by police in Calais and the surrounding area. 'Twenty-one, including two children, have said that the police sprayed them with tear gas.' Most of the migrants are living without shelter, with no . access to toilets and showers and limited access to running . water. Many rely on meals provided by local volunteer . organizations. Under French law, asylum seekers have the right to be housed . in a state-run facility as they await the processing of their . claim. Human Rights Watch said it had called on the French government to launch an immediate investigation and also provide police with guidance over the use of force. French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve accused the group of 'not verifying the allegations of police violence to which it refers'. He added: 'The seriousness of the charges against the public security forces contained in this document should have led the association to approach those in charge of the police with specific facts.' Calais Prefect Denis Robin, who oversees the police force, said many of the injuries suffered by refugees were as a result of fights between rival migrant gangs.","Report by accuse French police of beating migrants in Calais .

"Republicans always enjoyed leaving Nevada Sen. Harry Reid bandaged and bruised during touch legislative fights, but they never thought they'd see him like this. Reid returned to the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday after missing the first two weeks of the new congressional session with major injuries from an exercise-related accident. The liberal stalwart, derided by Republicans as 'Dingy Harry,' broke several bones in his face and fractured some ribs when an exercise machine failed on New Year's Day, hurling him headlong into cabinets at his new house in Nevada. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada returned to Capitol Hill in Washington on Tuesday, welcomed with cheers by fellow Democrats, but won't be up to attending Obama's annual speech . CRUSHED: Reid has broken bones in his face and fractured ribs, suffered when a piece of exercise equipment failed and sent him barreling into cabinets at his new house in Nevada . He sported an eye bandage as he walked the Capitol's halls, telling reporters that his right eye is 'doing better' and he's feeling 'not bad.'Reid's fellow Democrats greeted him with a round of applause. Reid, 75, is the Senate minority leader and spent the last six years leading a Democratic majority before it evaporated in November's elections. He has already pledged to run for a sixth six-year Senate term in 2016, despite being banged-up. His office distributed a photo of him Tuesday morning on Twitter, showing the senator sitting at his desk and sporting an eye patch, with nothing to cover the remaining bruises on his face. Reid aides told the Associated Press that he won't attend President Barack Obama's State of the Union speech. His spokespersons told reporters on Jan. 2 that he would be at work in Washington a few days later, following treatment at University Medical Center in Las Vegas. That return ended up taking weeks longer. 'Senator Reid will return to Washington this weekend and be in the office Tuesday as the Senate prepares to reconvene. His doctors expect a full recovery,' their statement said 18 days ago. But as of Jan. 9, he was still housebound – and talking about the possibility of losing sight in his right eye. His recovery 'isn't anything that is a slam dunk,' he told Las Vegas public radio station KNPR. 'I had a serious injury in my eye. There was some blood accumulation there and they’re hoping it resolves itself.' 'I think I've done a good job directing my crew without me actually being physically present at the Capitol,' he added. Reid, shown with fellow Democratic senators Patty Murray (left), Dick Durbin (2nd left) and Chuck Schumer (right), has been taking meetings at his Washington, D.C. home but hadn't been seen at the office until Tuesday . WALKING WOUNDED: In previous accidents, Sen. Harry Reid dislocated his shoulder and had a rain-slicked slip-and-fall while jogging . Reid is no stranger to bumps and bruises – not political metaphors but the physical kind. He dislocated his shoulder and bumped his forehead in May 2011 when he slipped and fell during a morning jog in the rain. Reid leaned on a wet car near his home in Washington, D.C.'s Ritz-Carlton hotel and tumbled to the ground. That fall left him with a contusion just below his left eye, but he was back in action later that night at a fundraiser for California Sen. Barbara Boxer. Shortly after his accident nearly three weeks ago, he began taking meeting with fellow Democrats at his home in Washington. 'Most people know I fought [boxed] for a couple of years,' he said during one such meeting. 'After any one of those fights, I never looked like I do now.'","Reid, 75, broke ribs and fractured bones in his face when an exercise machine broke and send him flying into cabinets at his new Nevada house .

"Campaign: Debbie Butler handed out leaflets suggesting Gerry and Kate McCann were responsible for their daughter’s disappearance . A woman who repeatedly accused Madeleine McCann’s parents of neglect left her own elderly mother and father in squalor for five weeks. Debbie Butler, who handed out leaflets suggesting Gerry and Kate McCann were responsible for their daughter’s disappearance, was supposed to be caring for her parents Alan and Dorothy Johnson, who both suffered with dementia. But instead the 51-year-old went on holiday to Spain where she allegedly had an extramarital affair. She had stolen £18,400 from her parents to fund her trips away as well as to buy booze and consumer goods. After being left helpless for more than a month, her 74-year-old mother died in October 2011. Butler’s sister then found their 79-year-old father, a former Met police officer and Royal Marines veteran, emaciated and covered in his own filth. Butler was handed a two-year suspended prison sentence at Brighton Magistrates Court for fraud last week. She had taken cash from her parents’ accounts, used their debit cards and diverted their state pension and care allowance. Butler, who has a grandson, had not arranged any carers to cover her absence in Spain and did not attend her mother’s funeral. Judge Rennie said: ‘You have brought tremendous shame on yourself. ‘I accept that you were overrun at the time with problems… All of that may explain why you did what you did but it could never, ever excuse it. This was inexcusable, this was a dreadful abuse of trust.’ Butler chaired the Madeleine Foundation, which supposedly campaigned for justice for three-year-old Madeleine, who vanished in Portugal in 2007. Abuse: Butler arranged for leaflets to be distributed in the home village of Kate and Gerry McCann (pictured) Butler's parents Alan and Dorothy Johnson (left on their wedding day and right) both suffered from dementia . A hearing later this year will determine how Butler, of Maidstone in Kent, (pictured) is to repay what she stole . She arranged for hundreds of inflammatory leaflets to be distributed in the McCanns’ home village in Leicestershire. Butler’s sister, 48-year-old Michelle Johnson, said she would never forgive her for ‘defrauding and dehumanising’ their parents. ‘The money is one thing, the neglect is the evilest thing,’ she added. A hearing later this year will determine how Butler, of Maidstone in Kent, is to repay what she stole. She was convicted in December of four counts of false representation. After being left helpless for more than a month, Butler's 74-year-old mother died in October 2011. Her 79-year-old father, a Royal Marines veteran (above with his wife), was found emaciated and covered in his own filth .","Debbie Butler distributed inflammatory leaflets in McCanns' home village .

"A woman who visited McDonald’s for the first time in nearly two years was confronted with a nauseous sight when her ‘healthy’ chicken McWrap was served up ‘raw’.

"Paint peels from the walls, rubbish litters the floors and wild flora is gradually encroaching on this vast, crumbling monument to a disease that is now all but defeated in the West. Built to treat patients suffering from a disease that once was the cause of nearly a quarter of all deaths, these eerie images prove there is no longer any sign of life at this abandoned tuberculosis hospital. Equipment lies gathering rust and walls are left crumbling in the desolate sanatorium, shot by Johnny Joo, 24, a photographer who specialises in capturing the gradual decay of abandoned places. Scroll down for video . Going back to nature: The outside of the J.N. Adam Memorial Hospital for Tuberculosis in Perrysburg, NewYork . Deserted: The sanatorium, first built in 1909, has been abandoned since 1995 due to an ownership dispute . Colonial style: The sanatorium was modelled after southern plantations, complete with ornate columns and open balconies . Desolate: Weak light streams into the hospital interior through high windows and an ornate stained-glass skylight . Trashed: Lunch trays and broken glass litter the floor and paint peels from the walls in what appears to be some kind of kitchen . Spooky: Another view of what seems to be a kitchen gives a better look at a mystery machine left behind when the hospital was closed . Hygiene: Hydraulic-powered bath tubs remain from the institution's latter days as the J. N. Adam State School for Severely Mentally Retarded . Abandoned: The photographer uses remote flash to highlight this old wheelchair simply left behind when the building was closed . Reclaimed: Weeds grow from the floor where light streams in through a miraculously intact window in a room of the hospital . The hospital in Perrysburg, New York, is hidden amid more than 500 acres of forest. It began life in 1909 when the U.S. was suffering a tuberculosis epidemic as a place for long-term sufferers to recuperate or, just as likely, to die. By the 1960s however antibiotics, vaccines and screening programmes were beginning to gradually defeat the disease in developed countries and such facilities were no longer needed. The sanatorium began a new life as an institution for the treatment of developmental disabilities. Mr Joo, who travelled from his home in Cleveland, Ohio, to photograph the hospital, said: 'The space ran as a tuberculosis ward from 1909 until the 1960s when it was then turned to the state of New York, who would continue to use it as a developmental disability centre. 'By 1995, the end to treatment of such disabilities in an institutionalised setting had come to an end and since then it has sat vacant. 'It now sits as an empty gem full of nothing but stale air and asbestos.' Mayor James Noble Adam, for whom the hospital is named, purchased the 293-acre site and donated it to the city in the early 1900s before it was officially opened in 1909. It was listed on New York's register of historical places in 1985, but was nevertheless abandoned in 1995 and has sat gathering dust ever since. More video on YouTube .

Mr Joo said: 'This massive location was commissioned by Buffalo mayor J.N. Adam to be built in 1909, to house and treat carriers of The White Plague, known as tuberculosis. 'Most Western New York residents have not even set eyes on this massive structure as it is surrounded by 500 acres of forest on each side. 'This complex is one of several buildings in the area designed by architect John H. Coxhead - his most well-known being the Michigan Avenue Baptist Church. 'The sanatorium was modelled after southern plantations, complete with ornate columns, and open balconies every which way you turn your head. 'These balconies were used in the treatment of patients, letting them rest in the open air with high altitudes, which were recommendations for treatment of the disease. 'People had lived out their lives here and with enough space to do so. 'One of my favourite rooms would have to be the main dining hall as it resembles a chapel with its dome-ceiling room. 'It comes complete with ornately designed stained-glass window atop its roof and would have been the main section for patients to join together at mealtimes.'","The desolate former sanatorium for tuberculosis sufferers was opened in 1909 and finally abandoned in 1995 .

"Appearance: Gary Glitter, 70, arrives for his trial at London's Southwark Crown Court yesterday . Gary Glitter’s mansion was a ‘magical place’ for little girls, with a room full of sweets, a swimming pool and ponies to pet, his rape trial heard yesterday. The former glam rock singer is said to have had shelves stacked with jars of goodies for children and let teenage girls keep their horses at his sprawling countryside home. Yesterday a woman who has accused the 70-year-old of trying to rape her when she was eight, told how she initially felt ‘really lucky’ to be invited to his house. She told Southwark Crown Court she thought the mansion was ‘magical’ when he first drove her there in his Rolls-Royce in the 1970s. ‘Everything smelt new, there was loads of corridors and everything was really plush,’ she said. ‘There was a swimming pool.’ The woman, who is now a nurse, told jurors she enjoyed eating treats in his ‘sweet room’, saying: ‘You went inside and there were loads of jars on shelves with different types of sweets.’ Earlier, John Price, QC, prosecuting, said: ‘To a little girl it must have seemed a magical place.’ The primary pupil also went to parties attended by Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, and fellow rocker Alvin Stardust, the court heard. But after one dinner party, Glitter is alleged to have sneaked into bed with her and a friend and attempted to rape her. Yesterday, she sobbed as she recalled the alleged assault which left her in pain, and feeling ‘ashamed and dirty’. Scroll down for video . In court: A sketch by artist Elizabeth Cook of Glitter appearing at Southwark Crown Court on Monday. Glitter is said to have crept into a youngster's bed and tried to assault her . But jurors heard Glitter showed no remorse and taunted her about it years later, saying: ‘Do you remember what I did to you?’ Giving evidence from behind a screen, the woman, now in her 40s, told how she woke to find him in bed between her and her friend. ‘I just knew it was him. He smelled of alcohol and the party. I rolled completely on my side away from him then he rolled over toward me. He put his arm around and started to cuddle me.’ She said she felt ‘uncomfortable’, but didn’t want to be ‘rude’. Choking back tears, she added: ‘He started moving my nightie up. I didn’t want him to.’ Glitter (centre) arrives with two other men he got out of a car with for his trial in central London yesterday . Musician: Glitter - Paul Gadd - is a former rock star . The assault stopped only when the girl managed to roll into a ‘cocoon’ of sheets separating her from Glitter, the court heard. But the next day he acted ‘normal’ and gave her chocolate, it was alleged. Years later, she said, she saw him at another party, where he invited her to a bedroom and asked her to give ‘Uncle Gary’ a cuddle on the bed. ‘He put his arms around me and rolled me so I’m sort of lying beside him. I was just extremely uncomfortable. 'Then he asked if I remembered what he had done to me. He kind of laughed and asked if I had liked it.’ Terrified, the teenager refused his advances and left the flat, the court was told. But jurors heard that she did not go to the police until 1998 when she heard that Glitter had been arrested for amassing a hoard of child pornography. Glitter denies one count of attempted rape, seven of indecent assault, one of administering a drug or other substance and one of sex with a girl aged under 13. The trial continues.

"A nine-month-old northwest Missouri boy has died after being accidentally shot in the head by his five-year-old brother. Emergency responders were called to a home in Elmo just before 9am on Monday after receiving a frantic call from the children's mother, Alexis Wiederholt. She told emergency services that she needed an ambulance at her home as her five-year-old had shot her infant son Corbin in the head with a paintball gun, news she found out when the young boy ran to tell her; 'I'm sorry, Mom. I shot Corbin.' She later found out it was in fact a revolver, and not a paintball gun, that had been fired. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: Corbin Wiederholt (above in mother Alexis' arms with his father Brad and three older brothers) was killed when his five-year-old brother reportedly shot him with a revolver . Horrible accident: Corbin's mother initially told police that the nine-month-old (above) had been shot with a paintball gun while in his crib . 'I walked in and there was my baby, lying there, bleeding,"" the young mother told NBC News. 'I had just hugged him in my arms five minutes before that.' Alexis also revealed that she had no idea her father, William Porter, even kept a loaded gun in the home she and her children were visiting. 'I didn't know it was there until I turned around and saw it laying on the bed,' she said. 'I don't know why someone would have a loaded gun in the house while kids were around.' Porter said of the tragedy; 'I told the boys they weren't supposed to be in my bedroom where I keep the gun cabinet and they knew it — but like I said, boys will be boys.' When police arrived they discovered that the older boy had apparently found a loaded .22 caliber Magnum revolver which he was holding when it fired, injuring his younger brother, the Kansas City Star reported. The loaded gun belonged to a family member and was kept on a shelf built into the headboard of the master bed, Sheriff White told Fox4. The playpen was in the same room. The baby was taken by air ambulance to the hospital but was pronounced dead at Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City just before noon yesterday. Authorities say their is no reason to believe the incident was anything other than a tragic accident, as Corbin's three older brothers (above with their mother) are now in the custody of a family relative . Nodaway County Sheriff Darren White said the baby was pronounced dead at Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City just before noon yesterday . White said there was no reason to believe the incident was anything other than a tragic accident. Neighbor Jessica Hutchison, said: 'I think that gun safety could have come into play and would have maybe prevented the situation. It's just really sad altogether.' The five-year-old boy along with two other siblings are in the custody of relatives. Amid increasing public concern about possession of guns, The Washington Post recently reported that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention (CDC) has not conducted research on gun control since 1996 despite President Barack Obama ordering the organization to resume studies two years ago.","Nine-month-old Corbin Wiederholt was shot in the head while in his playpen at his grandfather William Porter's home .

"An alleged bullying incident during which a 15-year-old boy was tied up with his hoodie over his face in Minnesota is being investigated by authorities after the boy’s parents used social media to draw attention to it. Dave and Nicolette Rochefort say they were shocked when they found out what had happened to their son, especially as a teacher had been present. They say the teacher made no effort to stop the bullies – two 18-year-olds and a 17-year-old - who also whipped their son with an electrical cord. The incident happened at Osakis High School during an industrial technology class on Friday. A photo showing the boy sitting on the floor with his hands tied behind his back and a hoodie tied tightly over his head was posted on Facebook by the boy's mother . A photo showing the boy sitting on the floor with his hands tied behind his back and a hoodie tied tightly over his head was posted on Snapchat another student. Nicolette Rochefort posted the photo of her son on Facebook on Friday. ‘Police say there is no criminal activity here!,' she wrote. 'Apparently it's okay to tie children up in school. Please share and pass on I want all of mn to see this. Bullying policies are NOT working!’ The post has since received more than 40 comments and been shared more than 16,000 times. Dave Rochefort likened the position his son was left in to images in the media of extremists. 'My 15-year-old son was tied up with his hands behind his back, legs in front, and his hood pulled tightly over his head and tied around the neck,' he told Fox 9 News. 'Just like you see the terrorist group ISIS do to the people they kill.' The boy's mom Nicolette Rochefort, left, says police claims that her son chose to be involved are ludicrous. Teacher Kyle Kostrzewski, right, has been placed on administrative leave while the district investigates . The parents allege that the incident went on for 40 minutes and only ended when a fire alarm sounded in school. Their son - who hasn't been named - called home immediately after the incident and his father picked him up and they went to the police department. After interviewing other students in the class, Police Chief Chad Gulbranson told Osakis Review that it appeared that the victim chose to be involved in the act. ‘As horrible as the picture looks, it was determined that there was nothing criminal involved,’ said Gulbranson. The Rocheforts say claims that their son was a willing participant are 'ludicrous.' The incident happened at Osakis High School in Minnesota during an industrial technology class on Friday . Dave Rochefort claims his son has been a repeated target of bullying at the hands of upperclassmen, and that teachers and administrators have consistently turned a blind eye. 'It's ridiculous, these boys are troublemakers and nobody does anything about them,' he said. He says his son has been shaken up by what happened and they have decided to pull each of their four kids out of Osakis schools as a consequence. The teacher of the class where the bullying incident allegedly occurred is Osakis City Council member Kyle Kostrzewski. He has been placed on administrative leave while the district investigates the incident.","A 15-year-old boy was tied up with his hoodie over his face and whipped with an electrical cord at a Minnesota school on Friday .

"Baby Gammy, the baby at the centre of the Thai surrogacy scandal, has celebrated his first day as an Australian citizen. In 2014, Gammy's surrogate mother, Pattamaron Chanbua, applied for citizenship along with her son, as a way to safeguard his future. Australian charity Hands Across the Water aided the process, previously securing a house for Gammy and his family. Scroll down for video . Gammy celebrates his first birthday on Tuesday, after being the centre of an international scandal this year . Gammy first made headlines when Ms Chanbua claimed that West Australian couple Wendy and David Farnell had abandoned him in Thailand, after discovering he had Down Syndrome. The Farnells returned to Australia with Gammy's twin sister Pipah, while Ms Chanbua remained with Gammy in Thailand's Chonburi province. Mr Farnell, a convicted child sex offender, retained custody of Pipah late last year after an investigation by the WA Department for Child Protection. In November, WA Child Protection Minister Helen Morton said there would be 'continual and rigorous testing' of a safety plan that had been developed for Pipah. The Department of Immigration and Border Protection confirmed on Tuesday that Gammy's application for citizenship by descent had been granted. Gammy pictures with his Thai surrogate mother Pattaramon 'Goy' Chanbua during a trip to the beach . Gammy is a happy, healthy little boy who lives in a new house with his loving family . Ms Chanbua said that despite the official decision, she had no immediate plans to take her son to Australia.' 'I want him to be near me here so that I don't have to miss him,' Ms Chanbua, 21, said. 'But if all of my family, including me die and if Gammy is left behind alone, at least the Australian government will help him,' she said. Ms Chanbua confirmed that Gammy was in good health and had celebrated his first birthday in December. They live in a comfortable house paid for using part of the $250,000 raised for the family through public donations, which has new furniture, a television set, and plenty of kids' toys. And apart from a few minor hospital visits the family lives a normal life, even going on trips to the beach together. Hands Across The Water founder Peter Baines visited the family earlier this month to assess their situation and needs. Pictured: Goy and her three children . The charity handling Gammy's medical and living expenses said  Gammy loved playing with his siblings . Peter Baines, founder of the charity handling Gammy's medical and living expenses, said the family had been doing well since moving into their new home in October. 'Gammy's had some health issues and that's not to be unexpected, but they're certainly in a better space then they would have been,' said Mr Baines, of Hands Across The Water. 'He had a repeat of a lung infection and spent a few days in hospital. 'Nothing as severe as what it was the first time and certainly it was treated a lot quicker and recovery was a lot better than what it was.' Mr Baines added that Gammy loved playing with his siblings. 'He's just a healthy, happy boy who loves interacting with his brother and he's got a beautiful personality about him,' he said. 'It's not right he be defined by health issues, or what happened to him, or the fact that he's got Down syndrome. Child protection officials in Western Australia are still conducting an 'extensive and rigorous' assessment into the welfare of Gammy's twin sister Pipah, pictured with David and Wendy Farnell . Almost half of the $250,00 raised was spent on the three-bedroom house, where the pair will live with Goy's husband, grandparents and two other children, 100km south of Bangkok .","Thai surrogate baby Gammy celebrates first day as an Australian citizen .

"Over the past eight years, Apple has released a total of ten iPhones, all said to be a slight variation on the one before. But, how much have the devices actually changed since the 2G’s 3.5-inch screen and rounded edges? Designers have combined models of each handset since 2007 to create a graphic that reveals the evolution of the phones as they morph in front of your eyes. Scroll down for video . The graphic was created for California-based image search site PicClick. It plots the design changes from the first iPhone, known as the 2G in 2007, through the iPhone 3G, 3GS, 4, 4S, 5, 5S and 5C, and the most recent iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. Designers n used image-morphing technology to create the GIFs . The graphic was created for California-based image search site PicClick. It plots the design changes from the first iPhone, known as the 2G in 2007, through the iPhone 3G, 3GS, 4, 4S, 5, 5S and 5C, and the most recent iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. Designers compiled high-resolution 3D models of each handset, and then used image-morphing technology to create the GIFs. Each design is visualised from the front, side and rear, and the changing sizes are also demonstrated in a picture created by the firm. ‘Critics of the Apple iPhone often say that the design and features of each new model barely change and each phone is just a slightly tweaked version of the last,’ explained PicClick. The graphic (pictured) shows that the most noticeable change among the recent iPhone iterations is how much of the front of the device is devoted to the screen. Until the iPhone 5, the overall size of the phone remained the same. At this point, in September 2012, Apple jumped from a 3.5-inch screen to a 4-inch display . The 4-inch display remained for two years, also being used on the iPhone 5S and 5C. Last September, Apple increased this display size again, to 4.7-inches for the iPhone 6 and its first foray into phablets, with 5.5-inches on the iPhone 6 Plus. ‘As mobile video grows, Apple has expanded screens accordingly,’ said PicClick . ‘We wanted to put this claim to the test. ‘With the help of image-morphing technology, we visualised the changes from three different perspectives.’ The graphic shows that the most noticeable change among the recent iPhone iterations is how much of the front of the device is devoted to the screen.

It has a 3.5-inch, 160-pixel per inch screen . iPhone: The iPhone was released on 29 June 2007. It has a 3.5-inch display, 160-pixel per inch screen. The phone includes, contacts, calendar, visual voice mail, SMS and quad-band GSM + Edge, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Steve Jobs announced at the launch the software also lets people have multiple SMS messaging sessions at once. iPhone 3G: The iPhone 3G has a plastic rear, and includes 3G, GPS, and comes in white. iPhone 3GS: Apple’s third iPhone, the 3GS is almost identical to the 3G, but comes in silver. The firm added a 3MP rear camera, voice control as well as a cut, copy and paste. iPhone 4: By the iPhone 4, Apple had redesigned the phone to feature stainless steel and glass, and it became more square than previous models. The 4 has a front-facing camera, Retina display, FaceTime and the rear camera has been boosted to 5MP. iPhone 4S: Design-wise, Apple’s iPhone 4S was very similar to the iPhone 4 but Apple added an 8MP camera, and support for Siri. iPhone 5: It wasn’t until the iPhone 5 that Apple took another look at the design. Made using aluminium, the phone has a larger screen, an 8MP camera, this time with a sapphire crystal lens, and HD FaceTime. The iPhone 5 was the first model to use the Lightning connector port. iPhone 5S: In 2013, Apple broke away from its traditional release schedule and launched two phones at its September event. The iPhone 5S is a marginal improvement on the iPhone 5, and comes in gold, black and white. It was the first phone to feature the Touch ID sensor. The most recent handsets, released in September, are the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus (pictured). Both have the fingerprint scanner introduced on the iPhone 5S. The iPhone 6 has a 4.7-inch display, and the iPhone 6 Plus’ is 5.5 inches. Both have Retina HD displays and both came with NFC chips for the first time . iPhone 5C: Meanwhile, the ‘budget’ iPhone 5C was launched with a plastic rear. Internally, the phone is almost identical to the iPhone 5, but it comes in a wider range of colours. iPhone 6 and 6 Plus: The most recent handsets, released in September, are the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. Both have the fingerprint scanner introduced on the iPhone 5S. The iPhone 6 has a 4.7-inch display, and the iPhone 6 Plus’ is 5.5 inches. Both have Retina HD displays, a return to the more rounded edges of previous models, and both come with NFC chips for the first time. These can be used with Apple Pay. The camera has remained the same, but the iPhone 6 Plus additionally has optical image stabilisation. At this point, in September 2012, Apple jumped from a 3.5-inch screen to a 4-inch display. The 4-inch display remained for two years, also being used on the iPhone 5S and 5C. Last September, Apple increased this display size again, to 4.7-inches for the iPhone 6 and its first foray into phablets, with 5.5-inches on the iPhone 6 Plus. ‘As mobile consumption of video and social content grows to rival - and in some cases exceed - desktop use, Apple has expanded screens accordingly,’ continued PicClick. The width of each handset has grown with each iteration. The first generation is 2.4inches (61mm) wide. The 3GS is 2.44 inches (62.1mm), the 4S is 2.31 inches (58.6mm), the iPhone 5C is 2.33 inches (59.2mm) and the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are 2.64 inches (67mm) and 3.06 inches (77.8mm) respectively . On all handsets, the home button has remained in the same place, but since the iPhone 5S it has doubled up as a fingerprint scanner called the TouchID sensor. Over the past eight years, the iPhone has slimmed down significantly in nearly all its successive versions. The 2G is 0.46 inches (11.6mm) thick and the iPhone 4 dropped to 0.37 inches (9.3mm). By the 5S the thickness was 0.3 inches (7.6mm), and the most recent iPhone 6 Plus is just 0.28 inches (7.1mm) - a total drop of 0.17 inches (4.5mm). Width is a different story, however, growing with each iteration. The first generation phone, which has since been discontinued, is 2.4inches (61mm) wide. The 3GS is 2.44 inches (62.1mm), the 4S is 2.31 inches (58.6mm), the iPhone 5C is 2.33 inches (59.2mm) and the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are 2.64 inches (67mm) and 3.06 inches (77.8mm) respectively.","The graphic was created for visual search site PicClick .

"If you are thinking about updating your Facebook profile with photos or getting in touch with an old flame via the website, you may want to think again. The social networking site is now cited in a third of all divorce cases, and is increasingly relied upon for proof of unreasonable behaviour, according to a survey of legal firms' caseloads. Facebook unwittingly provides evidence of infidelity and new relationships, helps track people's movements and records expenditure on everything from cars to holidays as users document their day-to-day lives. Couples who are filing for divorce are increasingly relying on social media as proof of misbehavior . Leeds law firm Lake Legal said that many cases revolved around social media users who got back in touch with old flames they hadn't heard from in years. Managing partner Lyn Ayrton says that Facebook sees us reveal certain details about our lives that can later be used in court. 'Social media provides an ongoing log of our lives. The sharing of written posts and pictures, often with geo-tagging, provides a record of activities that can be used in a court case,' she said. Law firm Lake Legal examined 200 of their divorce cases and found that over 66 had used the social networking site as proof of their partners infidelity . 'Often, if a partner refers to an impending bonus, a new job offer, or plans for a holiday, it may provide evidence that they are not telling the truth about their financial position. At the very least, it could call their credibility into question. 'It's like having a massive public noticeboard.' Lyn added that she had seen the social network provide irrefutable evidence of infidelity in the past. 'Somebody said she was not in a relationship with anybody new but then posted a message inviting everybody to a housewarming party for her and her boyfriend.' Facebook acts as a continual log of someone's life and certain photos or events attended can reveal foul play . Specialists at the firm examined more than 200 cases and found Facebook was used by legal teams in just over a third of cases. Julian Hawkhead, a managing partner at Stowe Family Law, agrees that what we choose to post on the site can tell a lot about the lives we are living. 'Photographs and comments made on these forums can be used as evidence of relationships or of a lifestyle which contradicts what people will otherwise try to portray. 'We regularly find clients coming to us with information they have found which is available in the public domain with proof of a relationship.' But it isn't just Facebook that adulterers should be wary of, Julian added that there were other means of discovering details about a people's lives. 'However, the internet can also provide a useful source of other information. Our in-house forensic accountancy team will often find rich pickings in gathering financial information through a Google search about a party, their location, where they have been and what they are doing with their lives. 'People need greater awareness of what information they are leaving about themselves on the internet which is otherwise waiting to be found at the touch of a button.'","A Leeds law firm examined 200 cases to see when it had been cited .

"Today it’s easy to explore foreign lands and oceans simply by using Google Maps, but centuries ago, when these worlds were first discovered, people had no choice but to rely on the tales of explorers. As these adventurers sailed uncharted seas and plotted what they saw, it was taken on face value that the lands they described existed. Maps featuring these mysterious, and at times imaginary, places were copied and recreated for centuries - and in the case of the non-existent Emerald Island in the South Pacific, featured in atlases as late as 1987. Phantom islands are islands that appeared on maps before disappearing. Among these is Thule, pictured here on the 1539 Carta Marina as Tile. The island was first referred to by Greek geographer Strabo in reports taken from the 4th century BC. It was later identified as Greenland . This map shows the location of phantom islands that appears on maps from the early 16th century, but later disappeared or were renamed . Centuries ago when the first explorers were travelling the world, people back home had to rely on the accuracy of . their sightings. As these explorers sailed the seas and plotted what they saw, it was taken on face value that these islands existed. However, . despite appearing on maps for decades, some of these spotted islands . were never seen again, while others were renamed. This phenomenon became known as the 'phantom island'. Some were geographical errors, some were islands that were later reclassified or re-identified, while and some were mysterious land masses that people claimed to have visited but others couldn’t find. EMERALD ISLAND . In the 1820s, British explorers on a ship called the Emerald reported sightings of an island south of the Macquarie Island, between New Zealand and Antarctica. Captain William Elliot and his crew wrote that the landmass, later called Emerald Island after the ship he was sailing on, was small and mountainous. However, explorers from the U.S. who tried to locate the mysterious isle in 1840 found no trace of it. The island was later spotted by a captain . visiting Port Chalmers in New Zealand some 50 years after this . expedition, yet a follow-up search by Captain John King Davis in 1909, . on board the ship Nimrod, again found nothing. Despite . this, the Emerald Island featured on maps and in atlases until at least . 1987, although it was gradually removed from many during that time. In trying to explain these mysterious . sightings, historians thought that Elliot and his crew may have seen . what is called a Fata Morgana, or a mirage, similar to those seen in the . desert but are spotted in polar regions. THE ISLE OF DEMONS . Similarly, . the Isle of Demons, was a mysterious mass of land off the coast of . Newfoundland that first appeared on maps during the 16th century, before . disappearing by the mid-17th century. In the 1820s, British explorers on a ship called Emerald reported sightings of an island south of the Macquarie Island, between New Zealand and Antarctica, pictured bottom left.  However expeditions in 1840 and 1909 found no trace of it. Despite this, the Emerald Island appeared on maps until 1987 . This map shows where reports claimed the mysterious Emerald Island was located. It is thought that the sightings were Fata Morganas, or mirages, similar to those seen in the desert, but are spotted in polar regions . Legend has it that a woman called . Margurite de La Rocque was sailing to New France in Canada, now known . as Quebec, and became pregnant to a sailor in 1542. She . was abandoned on the so-called Isle of Demons as punishment, to live . with the devils and wild beasts that inhabited the area. Two years later she was . rescued by fishermen and taken to France, where the story became popular . folklore and was even mentioned in poems by the late 19th century poet . George Martin. It is . thought the island that de La Rocque was marooned on was part of Quirpon . Island in the Labrador Sea, off the coast of Canada. The Isle of Demons, was a mysterious mass of land off the coast of Newfoundland that first appeared on maps during the 16th century, pictured here in 1543, before disappearing by the mid 17th century . The story of the Isle of Demons became popular folklore and was mentioned in poems by the late 19th century poet George Martin. It is thought the island was part of Quirpon Island in the Labrador Sea, pictured, off the coast of Canada . The Isle of Demons first appeared in 1508 and was often confused with the island of Satanazes, which means devils in Portuguese, located in the Atlantic Ocean. According to portolan charts, or navigational maps, from 1424, Satanazes was shown to the west of Portugal, and north of another phantom island called Antillia. It was shown with the inscription ‘Ista ixolla dixemo satanazes’ which means ‘This is the island called of the devils’. This island was never formerly . identified, but along with Antillia, many historians believe the two . islands to be the coasts of North and South America. More specifically, Satanazes may have been Florida, while Antillia may be what early explorers called modern-day Cuba, although this has never been verified. ANTILLIA . The legend of Antillia is believed to have originated during the Muslim conquest of Hispania in 714. Christian . bishops, looking to flee the peninsula, were said to have sailed until . they landed on an island known then as Antilha. According to reports, the Isle of Demons was often confused with the island of Satanazes. Charts from 1424 show Satanazes to the west of Portugal, right, near another phantom island called Antillia, left. Many historians believe the two islands to be the coasts of North and South America . It . first appeared on maps and nautical charts from 1424 until the 15th century, although after 1492 when the region was more accurately . charted, the island was removed from many maps. Frisland was a phantom island that appeared on maps of the North Atlantic for almost 100 years between the mid-1500s to 1660s. It appeared on a 1558 map as an . island to the south of Iceland and continued to feature on the maps of . famous cartographers Maggiolo, Mercator and Jodocus Hodius through the . 16th century.

Frisland was a phantom island that appeared on maps of the North Atlantic between the mid-1500s and 1660s. Historians have claimed Frisland was part of Iceland, and later Greenland, or may have even been the Faroe Islands. However, explorers in the mid-18th Century claimed the island was in fact Fair Isle, an island found between Shetland and Orkney Islands off the coast of Scotland. In a similar region to Frisland, explorers reported sightings of an island that later became known as Thule. The island was first referred to by Greek geographers in the 4th century BC. The location varied from Norway to Orkney, Shetland and Scandinavia. During the Renaissance period, the island was also identified as Iceland and Greenland. It was left . off some of the early maps of Europe in the 17th century, but reappeared . in 1630 off the east coast of Labrador.

In a similar region to Frisland, explorers reported sightings of an island that later became known as Thule. The island was first referred to by Greek geographer Strabo. In his reports of the ancient world called the Geographica, which Strabo was said to have begun as early as 20 BC, he recalls an account fellow Greek geographer Pytheas made of Thule in the 4th century BC. Pytheas’ eye-witness account described the inhabitants of Thule as having ‘fertile land’ in which they grew fruit, crops, grain and honey. Yet, the area lacked sunshine and floors were often ruined by rain. They were also believed to paint themselves blue and ride on chariots, according to Roman poems. Thule was always shown on maps, based on Strabo’s accounts, in the far north of the globe, yet the exact location varied from Norway to Orkney, Shetland and Scandinavia. During the Renaissance period, the island was also identified as Iceland and Greenland. More recently a municipality in northern Greenland once called Thule was renamed Avannaa.","Phantom islands are lands that appeared on maps before being removed .

"Brutal crime: Hyphernkemberly Dorvilier has been charged with killing her newborn baby by setting her ablaze on Friday night on Simontown Road in New Jersey . The woman accused of dousing her newborn daughter with WD40, setting her on fire and leaving her in the middle of a road to die has made her first court appearance on a murder charge. Hyphernkemberly Dorvilier, 22, did not enter a plea during a hearing Tuesday in Mount Holly. But the 22-year-old Pemberton Township woman said she planned to soon hire an attorney. The judge maintained her $500,000 bail, which was set after police found the baby in flames on Friday night in the middle of a residential road. Dorvilier was found with a can of WD-40 and a lighter in her jacket pocket, and the baby suffered third-degree burns over about 60 percent of her body, investigators said in court documents released by Burlington County prosecutors on Tuesday. The baby still had an umbilical cord and placenta attached, investigators said. Prosecutors haven't revealed a motive, and it isn't clear if she has an attorney. There was no answer at the two-story yellow house where Dorvilier lived with her mother and sister on a quiet suburban street in Pemberton, a town of about 28,000. Police were responding to a call about a fire on a residential road in the township on Friday night, about 30 miles east of Philadelphia. When they arrived, they found a neighbor holding Dorvilier down on the ground and the baby wrapped in a smoldering towel and paper, according to the court documents. The baby was alive and breathing when she was flown to a hospital in Philadelphia, but she died two hours later. Scroll Down for Video . Scene: Witnesses say 22-year-old mother got out of her car and stopped in the middle of Simontown Road in Pemberton Township, New Jersey, on Friday night and burned the child alive . Response: Medics rushed to the scene and airlifted the young child to St Christopher's Hospital in Philadelphia with severe burns. It succumbed to its injuries a short time later . Dave Joseph, who discovered the burning baby and held Dorvilier down, told police that the woman said the baby wasn't hers. Police said they found a trail of blood leading from Dorvilier's home and she appeared to be bleeding while at the hospital afterward. Her mother and sister told police that they were not aware of her giving birth, but police said they found blood on the floor of the downstairs bathroom. Joseph said the woman told him she was burning dog waste. 'It was just mind-boggling,' Joseph told the Burlington County Times. 'It was a nightmare even if you have a strong heart.'","Hyphernkemberly Dorvilier appeared in New Jersey court today .

"A post about domestic violence against men on the NSW Police Facebook page has sparked outrage and heated debate from commenters about the timing and nature of the comments. The post - which was uploaded on Monday - shows a picture of a man with a black eye while the accompanying text explains that one in five victims of domestic violence are men. Since then it has attracted over 12,000 likes, more than 1300 comments and has been shared on Facebook almost 3000 times. But the debate quickly turned sour with many pointing out that the upload was ill-timed in light of the murder of Sydney woman Leila Alavi allegedly at the hands of her estranged husband. There has also been outrage about the number of abusive and offensive comments which had been left up on the thread. Scroll down for video . NSW Police have come under fire for posting about domestic violence against men just days after the murder of a Sydney woman, allegedly at the hands of her estranged husband . 'You hear her screaming. The windows breaking,' the post on the NSW Police Facebook page began. 'You see the bruises. The look of fear in the children’s eyes. 'The police are called. 'But don’t assume you know how this story ends.Because she is the one who is arrested. And he is the innocent victim. He is the one living in fear. Domestic violence does not discriminate. 'Last year, 1 in every 5 domestic violence assaults that NSW Police responded to involving intimate partners were for male victims. 'The NSW Police Force has zero tolerance for domestic violence. You make the call - we’ll make it stop,' it concluded. The post is part of an ongoing campaign by NSW Police against domestic violence. Many people have weighed into the debate with offensive and inappropriate comments, none of which appear to have been moderated . A vast number have criticised the move in light of Leila Alavi's stabbing murder, which her husband has been charged for, saying women are still disproportionately affected by domestic violence . Ms Alavi's husband Mokthar Hosseiniamrae has been charged with her murder and refused bail . Since it was published thousands of people from all around the country have weighed into the debate, with some calling the police out for the poor timing of the post, to others praising them for shedding light on the issue. The thread also had people blaming women for any violence brought on them, accusing police of favouring women, even if they are the abuser, while other said they expected more from the police in light of recent events. These events include the murder of Sydney woman Leila Alavi, who was found dead in her car in the western suburbs just days ago. Her husband Mokthar Hosseiniamrae, 33, who police allege 'has physically assaulted his wife in the past, with incidents not reported', has been charged with her murder. Ms Alavi is said to have had an Apprehended Domesic Violence Order against Hosseiniamrae, but despite this he still allegedly murdered her with a pair of scissors. Others made the point that domestic violence is largely a gendered issue, the same stance taken by Rosie Batty whose son Luke was murdered by his father . Many brought up the plight of Leila Avili, an apprentice hairdresser from western Sydney . Rosie Batty - whose son Luke was murdered by his father - has condemned the post by NSW Police branding it 'a shame' and 'disappointing' All the comments and the full post by NSW Police  have been left up and do not appear to have been monitored. 'If a girl can throw a punch, she can taken one', one commenter wrote, while another said they were disappointed by the statement from NSW Police. 'I expected better from NSW Police. 81 women died in Australia last year at the hands of their male partners or exes.... A woman had her throat cut in a car park the other day. Thousands more women beaten every day by men. Go check the stats', the post read in part. Rosie Batty - a vocal advocate against domestic violence since her young son Luke was beaten to death by his father - said she was extremely disappointed with NSW Police's stance. 'It's absolutely a gendered issue and I'm really disappointed,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'We do need to acknowledge that it's not all men and its not all women but the key statistics are very clear. This commenter maintained that the perpetrators were very rarely women in such cases . Others sided with the police welcoming the important conversation despite the context . Some shared their experiences as a male dealing with domestic violence . 'It is one woman a week that's being killed... the statistics are overwhelming.' Ms Batty acknowledged while the point of violence against men was a valid one, in light of the death of Leila Alavi it was 'a real shame' and reinforced that domestic violence is an issue that affects disproportionately more women than men. 'If we're not approaching violence from that perspective ... it seem to me that it's disappointing there's not a consistent message,' she said, before adding that nonetheless it's a very important conversation to be having. Detective Superintendent Gavin Dengate, who is the Central Metroplitan Region Domestic Violence sponsor, said the single image was part of campaign of five different posters but admitted the timing was unfortunate. 'We knew that there would be conversation but this Facebook post is part of a large campaign we commenced back before Christmas,' Mr Dengate told Daily Mail Australia. 'We know that domestic violence and family violence rises significantly at this time of year.' Mr Dengate descibed the death of Leila Alavi as an 'absolute tragedy' but added: 'If people had been watching the campaign roll out I don't think anything would have happened'. Whne asked about the rate of AVOs which are breached in NSW per year - nearly half - Mr Dengate described the figure as 'very disappointing'. As for the unfortunate timing and abuse on the Facebook post he said the campaign needs to be looked at as part of a wider initiative. 'We certainly demonstrate that we look at all victims equally, but we do acknowledge that 80 percent of the victims are women.' This commenter provided one of the most level-headed responses to the situation . While some added nothing to the conversation . Other commenters on the post also brought up that while one in five domestic violence victims may be men, that does not necessarily mean it is at the hands of women. '1 in every 5 men... This includes gay relationships where men hit their male partners... Very rare to be a woman!' one person claimed. 'As someone who was beaten and raped many times by my ex boyfriend, it's good an empowering to finally see a post like this', one man commented. The debate about men breaking AVOs was also aired, in reference to statistics which claim nearly have of them in NSW alone are breached. 'While this is acknowledged, sadly it is still males that are breaking DVOs with at times impunity as as recently seen killing their ex-partners,' one woman wrote.","A post to the NSW Police Facebook page has sparked a fierce debate about domestic violence .

"They are two of the most ambitious firms in the hi-tech space - and are combining to put the internet in orbit and accessible to everyone. Google is to invest in Elon Musk's plan to launch a constellation of satellites in space. His SpaceX firm today confirmed it has raised a billion dollars in a new round of financing. Scroll down for video . Elon Musk, (pictured) says he wants to build a second internet in space, which could one day be used to enable people living on Mars to get online . Mark Zuckerburg revealed solar-powered drones, satellites and lasers are all being developed in the firm's labs to deliver the internet to underdeveloped countries. Small satellite manufacturers: Sierra Nevada and Britain's Surrey Satellite Technology are both adept at making increasingly cheap small satellites and have a good track record. 'Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) has raised a billion dollars in a financing round with two new investors, Google and Fidelity,' it confirmed, following speculation. 'Google and Fidelity join existing investors Founders Fund, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Valor Equity Partners and Capricorn. 'Google and Fidelity will collectively own just under 10 percent of the company.' Google is already developing its own hi-altitude balloons to deliver access to remote areas. 'This funding will be used to support continued innovation in the areas of space transport, reusability, and satellite manufacturing,' SpaceX said. According to The Information the deal will help SpaceX develop satellites that could beam low-cost Internet around the globe to billions who don't have it. 'The price and terms Google and SpaceX are discussing couldn't be learned although one person familiar with them said Google has agreed to value SpaceX north of $10 billion and that the size of the total round, which includes other investors, is very large,' the site said. Google was believed to be  planning the launch of a fleet of 180 satellites to provide web access for the 4.8 billion people not yet online. Google is tipped to spend $1 billion (£600 million) on the technology and is also planning on using balloons and drones. Google's Project Loon aims to launch high-altitude balloons to provide broadband service to remote locations below. The helium-filled balloons are designed to inflate to 49ft (15 metres) in diameter and carry transmitters that could beam 3G-speed internet to remote regions. In April, the company also acquired Titan Aerospace, which is building solar-powered drones to provide similar connectivity. The news comes days after SpaceX founder Elon Musk said he has set his sights on bringing it to space too. Mr Musk's project would involve hundreds of satellites orbiting about 750 miles (1,207km) above the planet – far closer than communications satellites in geosynchronous orbit at 22,000 miles (35,406 km). A stock image is shown . The entrepreneur says he wants to build a second internet in space, which could one day be used to enable any people living in colonies on Mars to get online. There is currently no name for the ambitious space venture, but it could speed up internet services on Earth too. Mr Musk told Bloomberg Businessweek's Ashlee Vance, that his aim is to create 'a global communications system that would be larger than anything that has been talked about to date.' Earlier this month, he said that he aims to share plans to build a colony on Mars, later this year. He said: 'It will be important for Mars to have a global communications network as well. I think this needs to be done, and I don't see anyone else doing it.' The project could cost $10 billion (£7 billion) and $15 billion (£10 billion), Mr Musk revealed in a Tweet, adding that any revenues would be used to fund a colony on the red planet. It would involve hundreds of satellites orbiting about 750 miles (1,207km) above the planet – far closer than communications satellites in geosynchronous orbit at 22,000 miles (35,406 km). At the moment, internet data packets travelling from London to New York, for example, have to pass through numerous routers and different networks, whereas Mr Musk plans to route packs via space satellites instead. This would make services faster and potentially cheaper too. The project will be run from SpaceX's Seattle office, whose employees will also work on the firm's Falcon rockets, for example. The ultimate goal is provide high-speed internet to the three billion people who have poor or no access to the web. It's thought it will take at least five years to produce and launch the first generation of satellites and the project could take over 15 years to work how Mr Musk envisions, The Huffington Post reported. The race is on to connect remote parts of the world, with both Google and Facebook also investing in technologies such as balloons and drones. Earlier this month, Mr Musk said that he aims to share plans to build a colony on Mars, later this year. An image of MarsOne's proposed colony on the red planet is pictured.

"The parents of a US journalist who was kidnapped in Syria while reporting on the conflict there have pleaded to the government to bring him home. Austin Tice was last heard from directly on August 13, 2012, near Damascus, while travelling to Lebanon. The former Marine was in the region reporting for McClatchy News, the Washington Post, CBS and others when he was taken. So far, no one has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping and no demands have been made. Scroll down for video . Austin Tice was last heard from directly on August 13, 2012, near Damascus, while travelling to Lebanon . His parents, who live in Houston, have been wrestling with how to deal with the situation. Many governments feel that a low media profile about captives keeps them safer, but Austin’s mother and father, Marc and Debra, feel that more publicity might encourage the US government to increase its efforts over the case. Marc told CBS: ‘We believe that by increasing awareness of Austin's situation that we can bring more public pressure, so to speak, a greater awareness, and that's the kind of thing that governments tend to respond to.’ Debra added: ‘The Syrian government has assured us that they will do all they can to find Austin. And the American government has also assured us they will do all they can to find Austin and bring him safely home. ‘Because of the diplomatic and political situations between those two countries, we can't be sure that they're communicating with each other even though they share this common objective.’ Footage of a man who appeared to be Austin surfaced in September 2012. In a crudely shot video, a group of armed men lead a blindfolded American up a rocky hillside, where he makes statements in broken Arabic before becoming too distressed to carry on. The former Marine was in the region reporting for McClatchy News, the Washington Post, CBS and others when he was taken . The identity of the man hasn’t been confirmed, but friends of Austin believe it is him. In a statement released on a website about Austin’s plight, Debra and Marc described the agony they’re going through. They said: ‘Austin is the oldest of our seven children. The Tice kids are very close, and Austin’s absence is agonizing. ‘We steadfastly work and pray for Austin’s safe return. We are sustained by our faith and by the kind thoughts and prayers that are being offered for Austin and our family. We are humbled, amazed and deeply grateful for the tremendous outpouring of support and assistance we have received from every corner of the globe; affirmation of all the lives that have been touched by our extraordinary son.’","Austin Tice was last heard from in August 2012, near Damascus .

"Colorado shooting suspect James Holmes sat quietly  in court on Tuesday ahead of the arduous process of jury selection for his murder trial. The 27-year-old, who opened fire on a packed movie theater in Aurora in July 2012, killing 12 people and injuring 70, was seen in civilian clothing for the first time since the shooting. As he sat in court, he had no visible restraints, though the judge had ordered him to be tethered to the floor in a way the public couldn't see for the trial. His dark hair was neatly trimmed, and he had a medium-length curly beard and wore oval-shaped reddish glasses - a stark contrast to his earlier bright orange hair and wide eyes. Scroll down for video . Smart: James Holmes, pictured in a courtroom sketch with Arapahoe County Public Defender Tamara Brady on Tuesday, was smartly dressed during his jury selection in Centennial, Colorado . Preparations: A courtroom sketch shows Judge Carlos A. Samour Jr. with members of the prosecution team (right) and defense team (left) during opening proceedings of the Holmes murder trial on Tuesday . An unprecedented jury pool of 9,000 people had initially been summoned but later fell to 7,000 after some summons could not be delivered and some people were excused. Through questionnaires, individual and group interviews, the pool will be winnowed to a handful in the weeks ahead to hear the death penalty trial that could last until October. The entire process is expected to take until May or June. Jury selection was set to begin later in the day on Tuesday with the first group of several hundred people filling out questionnaires. During a morning hearing, Judge Carlos Samour suggested that attorneys might not have to screen all the prospective jurors before beginning to select panelists. He said the process could stop after a few thousand people are screened if he and both sides agree they have a large enough pool from which to choose a jury. On Tuesday, the defense also objected to the use of a video during the trial, saying prosecutors gave it to them too late. The video is apparently from the jail where Holmes is being held, but its contents have not been made public. Heading to court: People enter the Arapahoe County court ahead of jury selection on Tuesday morning. The final jury will be selected from a pool of 7,000 people - down from an initial group of 9,000 . Waiting: People stand in a security line at the court house ahead of the start of Holmes' murder trial . Watchful eye: A security officer looks down from the roof of the Arapahoe County Justice Center Tuesday . The judge also spent about 25 minutes going over ground rules for jury selection and the trial, urging attorneys on both sides to be professional and respectful. 'We're going to be spending a lot of time together,' Samour said. On trial: Holmes, pictured in an earlier mug shot, wore civilian clothing to the court on Tuesday . The scope of jury selection and the trial are testaments to the logistical hurdles of trying the rare case of a mass shooter who survives his attack. 'The public is going to get an insight into the mind of a killer who says he doesn't know right from wrong,' said Alan Tuerkheimer, a Chicago-based jury consultant. 'It is really rare. It just doesn't usually come to this.' In the two and a half years years since the shooting, the case has sparked an emotionally charged debate, with Holmes' parents begging for a plea deal that would save his life while many survivors and family members of victims have demanded that he be put to death. Twelve people died and 70 were injured in the attack during a midnight showing of a new Batman movie. Holmes was arrested as he stripped off his combat gear in the parking lot of the Century 16 movie theater. He later pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to multiple counts of first-degree murder and attempted murder. If jurors find him guilty, they must then decide whether to recommend the death penalty. If Holmes is found not guilty, he would be committed indefinitely to the state mental hospital. Defense attorneys acknowledge Holmes was the gunman in the July 20, 2012, attack but say he was in the grip of a psychotic episode at the time. Stark difference: He is pictured on July 23, 2012, days after he allegedly opened fire on the movie theater during a midnight showing. His orange hair is now gone and he instead sports a curly beard . Under Colorado law, defendants are not legally liable for their acts if their minds are so 'diseased' that they cannot distinguish right from wrong. Part of the reason the case has dragged on so long is the battle over whether that standard applies to Holmes. Few details on those arguments have been made public. Prosecutors and defense attorneys remain under a long-running gag order, and court documents detailing the issue have stayed under seal. Holmes' sanity was evaluated by a state psychiatrist but the results were not made public. Prosecutors objected to the findings and persuaded a judge to order a second evaluation. Those results were contested by the defense. Prosecutors previously rejected at least one proposed plea deal made by attorneys for Holmes, criticizing the lawyers for publicizing the offer and calling it a ploy meant to draw the public and the judge into what should be private plea negotiations. Survivors of the attack and family members of victims have had a long time to get ready for a trial. Scene: Balloons, crosses and flowers are placed outside the Aurora movie theater after the shooting . Victims: Twelve people died in the attack, including AJ Boik, 18, left, and Veronica Moser-Sullivan, six, right . 'We've all been to therapists and have talked to our families and have our support groups, so we're prepared,' said Marcus Weaver, who was shot in the arm and whose friend, Rebecca Wingo, died in the attack. 'It's gonna be quite the journey.' It could take until June to find the jurors and alternates who were not biased by the widespread news coverage of the shooting. Equally challenging will be finding jurors who were not personally affected by the attack. Judge Samour called nearly nine times as many prospective jurors as were summoned in the ongoing Boston marathon bombing trial. That meant the county's 600,000 residents had a nearly one-in-50 chance of being selected.","James Holmes, 27, is accused of opening fire on a packed movie theater in Aurora, Colorado in July 2012 - killing 12 and injuring 70 people .

"An 11-year-old aboriginal girl with leukemia as died less than a year after refusing chemotherapy. Makayla Sault, an Obijwa girl from New Credit First Nation reserve in Ontario, Canada, suffered a stroke on Sunday and died the following day. The little girl's devastated family released a statement saying the three-month course of chemotherapy in 2014 had damaged her body and that she had been improving with traditional healing methods. Scroll down for video . Visions: Cancer-stricken Makayla Sault, who refused chemotherapy, said Jesus came to her and told her she was healed in this YouTube clip made in May. She died on Monday, her family said in a statement . Her parents, pastors Ken and Sonya Sault, told theTwo Row Times: 'Makayla was on her way to wellness, bravely fighting toward holistic well-being after the harsh side effects that 12 weeks of chemotherapy inflicted on her body. 'Chemotherapy did irreversible damage to her heart and major organs. This was the cause of the stroke. We continue to support Makayla's choice to leave chemotherapy. 'At this time we request privacy from the media while we mourn this tragic loss. Makayla was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) in January 2014 and suffered terrible weakness and nausea from the chemotherapy used to treat the cancer, despite anti-nausea medications. The grueling weeks of the chemo sent her cancer into remission. However doctors said that in order to rid Makayla of the cancer completely, she needed to undergo two years of treatment which would give her a 75 per cent chance of survival. Makayla's parents allowed their daughter to give up the chemo, a move that prompted doctors at McMaster Children's Hospital in Hamilton where Makayla was being treated to alert children's authorities. In May, Makayla read out a letter in a YouTube clip about how chemotherapy was 'killing' her body and that she saw a vision of Jesus who told her she was already healed. Makayla stopped chemo after 12 weeks of treatment when she was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) in January 2014 . The Saults took Makayla home, weakened and with a 10lb weight loss, for two weeks to recover after her first treatment. 'I have asked my mom and dad to take me off the treatment because I don't want to go this way anymore. 'I know that what I have can kill me, but I don't want to die in a hospital on chemo,' Mikayla said in the video. During the two weeks respite from chemo, Makayla's parents started her on a different form of treatment, which has left her feeling 'awesome,' she said. 'I wish that the doctors would listen to me, because I live in this body and they don't,' she added. Also during that time, Makayla said she had a vision of Jesus, flanked by two angels, who told her she was already healed, and not to be afraid. According to Two Row Times, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples asserts that indigenous people have the right to use traditional medicines and health care practices without discrimination.

"If you feel you have seen it all before, spare a thought for the young man convinced he is trapped in a time loop. The feeling of constantly reliving his actions became so severe he stopped watching TV, listening to the radio or reading newspapers. The 23-year-old even had to drop out of university and was tormented by further attacks when he holidayed abroad. A 23-year-old British man has had to stop watching TV and reading books because he suffers déjà vu so extreme he felt he'd seen it all before (file picture posed by a model) Psychologists diagnosed him with severe déjà vu, an extremely rare condition and the first known case to be triggered by anxiety. The feelings he experienced were stronger and far more frequent than the normal sense of déjà vu, which is French for ‘already seen’. The man said that rather than just a feeling of familiarity, he feared he was reliving the past moment by moment in a real-life enactment of the movie Groundhog Day. Details of the extraordinary case have been revealed in a report published by the Journal of Medical Case Reports. Although sporadic cases of severe déjà vu have been encountered before, all previous cases were triggered by neurological conditions such as epilepsy or dementia. However, in this case the trigger was the man’s anxiety, leading scientists to believe that anxiety disorders could be more related to déjà vu than previously thought, and the peculiar feeling could be triggered in the same way as panic attacks. Dr Christine Wells, a psychology expert from Sheffield Hallam University, said it could be the first case of a person experiencing persistent déjà vu stemming from anxiety. Past studies have linked the condition to seizures in the temporal lobe (the pink part of the brain, pictured) Even though he knew that what he was experiencing was not real, over three years the episodes gradually grew in intensity until they became debilitating. His case was analysed by experts from the universities of Sheffield Hallam, Exeter, Leeds, King’s College London and universities in Canada and France. All found his brain scans appeared normal. Déjà vu - French for 'aready seen' - is a recognised health condition, explored by scientists across the world. It is the phenomenon of having the strong sensation that an event or experience currently being experienced has been experienced in the past. The psychologist Edward Titchener in his book A Textbook Of Psychology (1928) explained the condition as being caused by a person having a brief glimpse of an object or situation, before the brain has completed 'constructing' a full conscious perception of the experience. That 'partial' perception then results in a false sense of familiarity. While scientists have spent years investigating déjà vu, a complete explanation is still lacking. The condition is reportedly experienced by more than 70 per cent of people at some point. A 2003 study revealed the condition is thought to occur in men and women across races equally. But the research found it was most common in people aged 15 to 25. Other studies have linked the condition with epilepsy. There is a strong correlation between déjà vu and the seizures that people with temporal lobe epilepsy suffer. A study in 2012 found people with medial temporal lobe epilepsy often experience deja vu as their seizures begin. That has led some experts to suggest deja vu could be the result of neural misfiring, where the brain transmits signals randomly, causing healthy people to experience a false sense of familiarity. Report author Dr Christine Wells, from Sheffield Hallam, said: ‘Rather than simply the unsettling feelings of familiarity which are normally associated with déjà vu, our subject complained that it felt like he was actually retrieving previous experiences from memory, not just finding them familiar. ‘Most cases like this occur as a side effect associated with epileptic seizures or dementia. ‘However, in this instance it appears as though the episodes of déjà vu could be linked to anxiety causing mistimed neuronal firing in the brain, which causes more déjà vu and in turn brings about more anxiety.’ The patient’s anxiety had been so serious he would take two or three showers a day because he felt ‘contaminated’ and repeatedly washed his hands. He began experiencing severe and frightening cases of déjà vu at 20. The early episodes sometimes lasted only for minutes, but other attacks could be extremely prolonged. At university he took the hallucinogenic drug LSD once, and from then on the déjà vu would last for several minutes at a time. He told Professor Adam Zeman at Exeter University he felt as though he was ‘trapped in a time loop’. Dr Wells said: ‘If proved, this could be the first-ever recorded instance of psychogenic déjà vu, which is déjà vu triggered by anxiety rather than a neurological condition such as dementia or epilepsy. ‘Distress caused by the déjà vu experience may itself lead to increased levels of déjà vu – similar feedback loops are reported in other anxiety states, for example panic attacks.’ Without knowing for sure exactly how the severe symptoms have been caused, Dr Wells said there was no way to treat the young man.","The 23-year-old British man told experts he felt 'trapped in a time loop'

"Three out of four of the UK’s 50 million easy access savings accounts now earn less than the Bank of England’s historically low base rate of 0.5 per cent. A report by the Financial Conduct Authority found that more than £160 billion is languishing in low-interest savings accounts. And five million people with more than £5,000 in easy access accounts – from which cash withdrawals can be made – could have made up to £650 million more in interest last year if they had switched to accounts with higher rates. Three out of four of the UK’s 50 million easy access savings accounts now earn less than the Bank of England’s historically low base rate of 0.5 per cent, a report by the Financial Conduct Authority has found . It warned that banks are still making it too hard for customers to see what interest rates they are getting, or to switch to a rival. This has stifled competition and kept interest rates even lower, when savers are already suffering the worst returns on record. In its report, the watchdog found that despite offering lower-than-average interest rates, the biggest four providers – HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds and RBS – continued to attract the most savings, with those who had accounts opened five years ago or more suffering the worst returns. Interest rates have plunged to their lowest level in 15 years, according to official figures, with fixed-term accounts attracting an average of just 1.8 per cent – dropping to a tiny 0.76 per cent for easy access savings. Interest rates have plunged to their lowest level in 15 years, according to official figures, with fixed-term accounts attracting an average of just 1.8 per cent – dropping to a tiny 0.76 per cent for easy access savings . Experts say it is a desperate time for savers, as the Bank of England’s base rate has been at 0.5 per cent since March 2009, and it is not expected to raise rates until at least the end of this year. Banks are still making it too hard for customers to see what interest rates they are getting, or to switch . In order to ease the misery of savers, the FCA said providers should be more transparent about reductions on interest rates and make it easier for customers to shop around. To make this happen, banks have been told they must clearly display the lowest rate of interest customers are receiving in all communications. It also suggested banks should send savers a regular statement which detailed how good – or bad – their interest rate was compared to others on the market. But the watchdog stopped short of banning controversial teaser rates, which offer high interest rates for a short time to lure new savers in before dropping them a little while later. A British Bankers’ Association spokesman said: ‘The FCA’s report identifies a number of proposed remedies which have the potential to make life even easier for customers and we will consider these carefully.’","Three out of four of the UK’s 50 million easy access savings accounts now earn less than the Bank of England’s historically low base rate of 0.5% .

"A cheating newlywed whose plot to kill her husband with a teenage lover became the subject of a Hollywood movie has made a new bid for freedom. Pamela Smart, of New Hampshire, was convicted of conspiracy to commit murder, being an accomplice to first-degree murder and witness tampering in March 1991 at the age of 22 over the death of her 24-year-old husband. She was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole but all the while has maintained she had nothing to do with plotting his murder. For the past two decades, she has lost all her legal appeals. Ms Smart, 47, now hopes that a new documentary examining the media fervor at her trial - which she believes swayed the public and ultimately the jury's decision - will convince New Hampshire authorities to allow her a parole hearing. Scroll down for video . Pamela Smart (left), of New Hampshire, was convicted of conspiracy to commit murder in March 1991. This photo (right) was used as evidence at her trial that ended in her being found guilty and sentenced to life without parole in the death of her newlywed husband . Nicole Kidman and Joaquin Phoenix star in To Die For, a movie based on the story of Pamela Smart . Smart was just 22 years old and newly married, when she began a torrid affair with a student, William Flynn. He was a 15-year-old enrolled in a self-esteem course she had volunteered to teach at Winnacunnet High School in Hampton, where she was the media services director. Flynn testified against his lover and said Smart wanted her husband dead so she wouldn't lose her condo, furniture and dog in a divorce. The teenager testified that Smart helped plan her husband's killing to make it look like a burglary. He said she persuaded him and his friends to kill her husband so she and Flynn could be together - and she also stood to gain $140,000 from insurance on Gregg Smart's life. Mr Smart was shot to death at the couple's Derry condo. According to testimony, a friend of Flynn's, Patrick Randall, held a knife to Smart's throat during the attack. Flynn - after asking God for forgiveness - fired a .38-caliber revolver. Two other friends, Vance Lattime Jr. and Raymond Fowler, were in a getaway car. Smart died a week before he and Pamela could celebrate their wedding anniversary. Smart has claimed that at the time of his death, the couple were trying to repair their relationship after he cheated on her first. The other three teens were convicted of murder conspiracy or accomplice charges. They all took pleas in return for reduced sentences and testified against Smart. The case was tabloid fodder, decades ahead of  cases such as Casey Anthony and Jodi Arias, which have captivated the public. Smart was dubbed the 'ice princess' during her trial and perceived as a self-absorbed woman with no friends. She believes that her public persona contributed the guilty verdict.

He testified that Smart persuaded him and his friends to kill her husband so she and Flynn could be together . She told NBC this week, from maximum-security Bedford Hills Correctional Facility in New York, that she had been tried in the 'court of public opinion'. Despite the glut of local and nationwide media coverage before jury selection in the state, the presiding judge, Douglas Gray, ruled against sequestering the jurors, according to NBC. Smart, who has achieved two masters' degrees while in prison and works as an HIV/AIDS counselor, added: 'I can either just give up or I can live, so if I'm going to live - which I am - then I have to do the best I can to fight the case, to stay healthy, to stay alive and to stay positive.' The 47-year-old also spoke to NBC about her difficult time behind bars. She was beaten so badly by two fellow inmates in 1996 that she was left with a broken eye socket and metal plate in her face. She has claimed that she was raped by a corrections officer. Smart's trial spawned to books and movies, including the 1995 film To Die For, which starred Nicole Kidman as a TV personality who enlists three teens, including a lover played by Joaquin Phoenix, to kill her husband. Flynn was moved to a minimum-security prison in November 2014 in Warren, Maine, as part of a work-release program. He could be freed later this year along with Randall who is also eligible for parole in June. The other men are already free, . But the new HBO documentary, 'Captivated: The Trials of Pamela Smart', has given the prisoner new hope as it focuses on the intense media coverage of the 14-day trial. For now, New Hampshire governor Maggie Hassan remains unconvinced, according to a statement made by her spokesperson, who said she believes that Smart 'had been justly and fairly convicted'. Smart's trial spawned the 1995 film To Die For, which starred Nicole Kidman as a TV personality, who enlists three teens to kill her husband .

"Outspoken politician Fred Nile has compared childcare centres to day orphanages just one week after he caused outrage when he said the only man in the Sydney siege was the gunman. Reverend Nile, the leader of the Christian Democratic Party, tweeted: 'Stay-at-home parenting is superior to 'day orphanages' (childcare). We need to reform our tax/welfare system to support parenting #teamnile.' While some have taken offence to his comments, Rev Nile argued it was a key election promise from his party, the Daily Telegraph reports. Scroll down for video . Outspoken politician Fred Nile has compared childcare centres to day orphanages just one week after he caused outrage after the saying the only man in the Sydney siege was the gunman . While some have taken offence to his comments, Rev Nile argued it was a key election promise from his party . 'We favour mother care rather than childcare. We prefer children are cared for by their parents, and there should be financial assistance for stay-at-home mothers,' he said. 'A lot of things children learn they learn from their parents, they learn from their mothers.' He again defended his stance again on Wednesday, tweeting: 'More childcare places & job vacancies would be created if stay-at-home parenting was a viable option'. David O'Byrne, the national secretary of United Voice - the union representing childcare workers - told Daily Mail Australia Rev Nile's comments were 'offensive'. 'He is breathtakingly ignorant about the role childcare plays,' Mr O'Byrne said. 'This outdated view that only women care for children in the home is offensive to early year educators and it's offensive to women and families. 'The guy really does not reflect the values of our communities... and he does not understand the needs and aspirations of families wanting to give their children the best start in life. 'He should take his role more responsibly as a member of parliament.' Reverend Nile argued on live television that the male hostages who fled the Sydney siege should not receive bravery awards . It comes just a week after people called for Rev Nile to resign after saying on live television the only 'man' inside the Lindt Cafe siege in December was the gunman. The Christian Democrat MLC told Sunrise: 'Usually men try to protect the women but it looks like the men were trying to protect their own skins. 'Where were the men? The only 'man' really there was the man with the gun.' Asked about his remarks in an interview with Daily Mail Australia, Rev. Nile said he 'misspoke'. 'I wanted to say he was a cowardly man. I left the word cowardly out. '(He was) hiding behind the shotgun. I was certainly not complimenting him.' 'Even the men who fled leaving women behind': This tweet posted by Fred Nile's team sparked controversy earlier this week. He later expanded on his remarks in an interview with Fairfax Radio . People called for Rev Nile to resign after saying on live television the only 'man' inside the Lindt Cafe siege in December was the gunman . In a follow-up tweet, he said: 'The terrorist was a coward. The real Man was the man WRESTLING with the gun.' Rev Nile also sparked controversy when he declared that the men who fled the Lindt cafe in Martin Place after being held hostage should not receive bravery awards. Two people, barrister Katrina Dawson and cafe manager Tori Johnson, were killed after the 17 hour siege on December 15. Mr Nile told Fairfax Radio earlier this month that Ms Dawson and Mr Johnson should be the only hostages given awards. Men and women flee the Lindt Cafe in Martin Place during the Sydney siege last December . He said he didn't think the other hostages should receive bravery awards. 'Maybe they could have done something more to protect the women. 'Normally bravery awards are given for an act of bravery - that somebody actually does something. They haven't done anything.' Mr Nile also argued that it would only lessen the worth of bravery awards to provide them to those male hostages who fled.","Fred Nile, leader of Christian Democratic Party, tweeted stay-at-home parenting was superior to 'day orphanages'

Andrey Grachev’s photos provide a rare glimpse inside the frozen grotto, but he had to travel across cracked ice that could give way at any moment. Even though many adventurers have plunged through the ice in the past, the 35-year-old ignored the dangers to capture the cave in a beautiful golden sunlight. Scroll down for video . Russian photographer Andrey Grachev risked his life on the frozen lake to capture breathtaking images of the ice cave at sunrise . Andrey's photos provide a rare glimpse inside the frozen grotto, but he had to travel across cracked ice that could give way at any moment . When the 35-year-old entered the frozen cave he found large ice stalactites, or icicles, descending from its ceiling . Andrey, from Moscow, and local guides safely crossed Lake Baikal in Eastern Siberia, where around 50 cars are still waiting to be plucked from the frigid water after falling through the ice. When he arrived at the magical cavern on Olkhon Island he found hundreds of icy stalactites and huge blocks of blue ice, known as ice hummocks. Andrey said: ‘Dozens of accidents are registered every year. All of the accidents are from cars collapsing under the ice and of course there are casualties.

"A girl with a food phobia has lived off a diet of chips and cheese for five years - because she claims anything else makes her feel sick. Jennifer Radigan, 17, eats mostly oven chips and is so repulsed by the thought of eating meat and vegetables she apparently heaves at the sight of them. The teenager, from Galston, in East Ayrshire, Scotland, claims she hasn't been able to finish a proper meal in years - and can only extend her diet to the occasional bowl of pasta or boiled potatoes. Scroll down for video . Phobia: Jennifer Radigan, 17, eats mostly oven chips because she finds the thought of eating meat and vegetables 'repulsive' Worrying: Jennifer's eating habits, thought to be one the main reasons she regularly faints in public, have caused her weight to plummet to just 6st 10lbs . Jennifer, who started refusing food from a very early age, said she used to be so ashamed of her phobia she would starve herself at school, then later lie to her parents that she had eaten. The college student is thought to suffer from a condition known as Selective Eating Disorder. This causes sufferers to be anxious or nauseous when they're presented with new or feared food, leaving them at greater risk of extreme weight loss and malnutrition. Jennifer's eating habits, thought to be one the main reasons she regularly faints in public, have caused her weight to plummet to just 6st 10lbs. At just 5ft tall, this means her BMI of 18.4. is below the healthy range. The teenager said: 'I used to live off mostly chicken, but now the smell makes me sick. 'It feels like the older I get, the fewer foods I can actually stomach, but I can't go wrong with chips and cheese. 'But they have to be McCain oven chips. 'It affects my everyday life, not so much the eating around people or out, but the symptoms that come with the health issues it has caused. 'I can't go one day without feeling completely exhausted or ill at at-least one point. It's like a never ending cycle of hell.' Although Jennifer was a fussy eater throughout her childhood, it wasn't until she turned 16 that she realised her eating habits had spiralled out of control. But it was only when she smashed her head on a concrete floor after fainting on her first day of work experience that she decided to go to the doctors for help. Tests revealed she was deficient in iron and vitamin B12. Doctors then suggested Jennifer's food phobia could be Selective Eating Disorder and have referred her to a specialist for formal diagnosis. Fussy: Jennifer will usually skip breakfast, have a plate of chips and cheese for lunch at college and pick at whatever her mother Karen, 41 (pictured) makes her for dinner . She said: 'I've fainted a total of five times now, and each time was different. 'One time I was shaking and when I came round I was still shaking - it was terrifying. 'I find myself getting very easily upset by it. I'll look in the mirror and think ""I'm nothing but skin and bones"" and ""is this how people see me?""' Jennifer will usually skip breakfast, have a plate of chips and cheese for lunch at college and pick at whatever her mother Karen, 41, puts in front of her at dinner. The British Journal of Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry has described Selective Eating Disorder (SED) as: ‘A little-studied phenomenon of eating a highly limited range of foods, associated with an unwillingness to try new foods. 'When this happens social avoidance, anxiety and conflict can result.’ Pilot studies in America have found many thousands of people who seem to fit the criteria for the disorder. But SED should not be confused with normal childhood fussiness. According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists, about 12 per cent of three-year-olds suffer from persistent selective eating — extremely faddy about their food — but fewer than one per cent carry it into adulthood. She said: 'There is nothing worse than having a beautiful meal put down to you and going to take the first bite and thinking I can't put this in my mouth. 'No matter how much I want to eat it, I can't. 'I've always had major issues with meats. The fat on it is just sickening. 'On school days I wouldn't eat breakfast or lunch - instead, I'd live off a KitKat and a small part of my dinner at night, no breakfast or anything. Her mother added: 'Jennifer's eating habits really scare me. She seems to go through stages where she improves slightly but they never last very long. 'To be honest, her food phobia started at primary school, with her mainly avoiding red meat. 'But it has spiralled and can result in her eating virtually nothing in a day. 'I have let Jen make a shopping list and buy the foods she wants, but even this can fail. 'She will often come shopping with me and I let her get what she wants - but this mainly consists of junk food. 'I support Jen, as does the rest of the family, I attend doctor's appointments and dietitian appointments with her and will support her to overcome this disorder.' Jennifer, who hopes to start university in September, is terrified her phobia of food will only get worse when she moves away from home. But having been recently referred to a specialist by her GP, she is finally hoping to be diagnosed with SED so she can get the therapy she needs. Support: Mrs Radigan said her daughter's eating habits terrify her. 'She seems to go through stages where she improves slightly, but they never last very long' 'I'm quite fearful about going to university, I've got used to eating around people I know but being around people I don't will be scary. 'I feel I will have to explain my situation in case I faint or don't eat in front of people. 'The foods I know I can't eat make me nervous as I know I need to eat them for the nutrients and that makes me upset. 'I can still get nervous when eating out but I've learned to brush it off. The only thing that scares me most is what could come from my eating or lack of eating. 'What if I fainted and no one was around to help me and I never woke up? I've worked hard myself to get to the stage that I'm at but I feel it slipping away as more foods are added to my ""can't to eat list"". 'Hopefully a proper diagnosis will help me get the therapy I need.'","Jennifer Radigan, 17, eats McCain oven chips and cheese every day .

"They don’t need feeding, cleaning or taking for a walk - they are the robotic pets for a generation of children raised on tech and tablets. A new era of sophisticated robotic pets, from lifelike jumping pug dogs to the most talkative of parrots, has been launched by Britain’s toy industry. The techno-pets offer the advantage that they will not make a mess on the carpet or demand they are taken for a walk, making them a more practical option than a puppy or kitten for busy families. A new era of sophisticated virtual pets, from lifelike jumping pug dogs to the most talkative of parrots, has been launched by Britain’s toy industry. This photo shows the Little Live Pets Clever Keet toy. Keet is billed as the ‘world’s smartest bird’. He talks, sings, dances, flaps his wings and even drives a cart . Roland Earl, director general of the British Toy and Hobby Association said: ‘There a lot of virtual pets, even the intelligent robots we are seeing might be seen as a pet substitute. ‘They are something to interact with that does not need feeding or cleaning up after. ‘I suppose families like clean and tidy houses, they spend a lot of time and money on their houses and they don’t like the mess and all the rest associated with a real pet.’ Mr Earl said: ‘There have always been “watch me” toys. People enjoy that. It is just fun. Character Options is also launching tiny versions of its Teksta robotic puppy, which is designed to behave like eight week old dogs. A less advanced, but popular version of the robo puppy is shown . A plethora of toys designed for children who can't have a real pet, are on the horizon.

And Hasbro will release JJ My Jumping Pug, a £40 furry pet that mimics a real dog. They are among six toys and games identified by the British Toy and Hobby Association as being the big sellers of this year. Lego and 'retro' toys such as the Thunderbirds Tracy Island are also set to be popular. ‘Some of the toys are incredibly clever. One of the most popular toys of last year was a parrot that you could talk to and it would then repeat back the words. That was endless fun. Kids really enjoyed that.’ A new more sophisticated version of the parrot, which is being called Little Live Pets Clever Keet and costs £60 ($91), is being launched later this year by toy firm Character Options. Keet is billed as the ‘world’s smartest bird’. He talks, sings, dances, flaps his wings and even drives a cart. The company’s menagerie also includes toy budgies, owls, mice, and turtles which can chat to their owner. The firm has also launched a new range of ‘wild pets’, which include giant spiders with a scarily lifelike appearance that will scurry across floor and react to touch. The arachnids operate in three modes, cage, adventure and attack. Character Options is also launching tiny versions of its Teksta robotic puppy, which are designed to behave like eight week old dogs. The firm said: ‘They make the sweetest, most adorable life-like pet that children can own. Each pet features realistic movement, responsive reaction to sounds and touch. ‘Children can even programme these devoted companions to sit, walk, beg and even sing happy birthday.’ Rival manufacturer Hasbro has come up with something that is a little furrier and mimics a real dog, the JJ My Jumping Pug, which comes in at £40 ($61). The world’s biggest toy brand, Lego, is predicted to have another successful year, not least because of a tie-up with the toy and film phenomenon of 2014, Disney’s Frozen. Interactive Frozen dolls are shown . The jumping pug is among 36 toys and games identified by the association as likely to big sellers through 2015.

"A billboard in west Los Angeles for the hit movie American Sniper has been defaced with the word 'murder' sprayed in red paint, as the bitter dispute over whether the film is about a hero or killer intensified. The LAPD have said that the prominent graffiti, which was discovered on Sunday, has since been covered up and no crime report has been filed. A Los Angeles Police Department spokesman also said that unfortunately finding those responsible will ultimately prove fruitless. Scroll Down for Video . Controversial: This is the billboard in West Los Angeles that was vandalized with the word Murder! 'Taggers like to throw up their own stuff,' LAPD Sgt. A. Bone told PEOPLE. 'If it's just the word 'murder' there's practically no way to track it down.' The polarizing film has sparked furious reactions online and drawn the ire of The Interview comedian Seth Rogen and documentary film maker Michael Moore. Moore took to social media on Sunday to liken snipers to cowards and claimed that his uncle was killed by one in World War Two - before he clarified his controversial tweet on Monday after a furious backlash. On Tuesday, Rogen also qualified comments also made on Sunday that the Clint Eastwood directed film reminded him of the fake Nazi propaganda vignette featured during the third act of Inglorious Basterds. Fake: American Sniper star Bradley Cooper has been nominated for Best Actor at this years Oscars . American Sniper: The biopic of Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, starring Bradley Cooper, has become a box office hit since its wide release last week. Kyle was credited with the most confirmed kills in American military history but tragically died a few years after leaving the military . Backtracking from Sunday's tweet that the Bradley Coooper movie made him think of the parody vignette at the climax of Inglorious Basterds, Rogen said 'there is a big difference between comparing and reminding.' That's not what I meant: Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore stirred up controversy on Twitter this weekend by calling snipers 'cowards'. He has since backtracked to say the comments were not meant in relation to the late Chris Kyle, or the recently-released movie based on his memoir,  American Sniper . To illustrate this point, Rogen used the old false analogy of apples and oranges to explain and said that in fact, he 'actually liked' the Iraq war feature. 'Apples remind me of oranges. Can't compare them though.' That cleared up, Rogen, 32, then threw in a small dig at the media ahead of their reporting of his sudden about-turn. Accusing the press of blowing his opinions 'out of proportion', The Interview star, wrote that he is happy to keep the fires burning on the controversy. Quentin Tarantino's Inglorius Basterds culminates with an assassination attempt on Adolph Hitler at the premiere of a fictional propaganda film called 'Stolz der Nation' which translates to Nation's Pride. One of the characters of the film is a haughty German soldier who plays himself in Nation's Pride, a movie about how he killed 200 Allied soldiers from a clock tower in one battle. American Sniper on the other hand stars Bradley Cooper as Chris Kyle, the real-life man who became the deadliest sniper in U.S. military history, saving hundreds of American lives with at least 160 kills. The film based off Kyle's memoir, ends with his tragic death in Texas, allegedly at the hands of a fellow soldier with PTSD he was trying to help. Rogen isn't the first to criticize the film this weekend, during which American Sniper topped the box office and raked in a record $105.3million. Clarification: The following day he clarified that his comments did not mention American Sniper or Chris Kyle . History: Moore wrote that while many aspects of the film were well done, he was not happy with director Clint Eastwood's depiction of the Iraq War . True story: The movie is based on Kyle's autobiography, written before he was shot dead in February 2013 . Oscar-tipped: Clint Eastwood's movie is hotly-tipped to pick up a few Oscars, including Best Actor for Cooper . Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore caused an online debate when he tweeted about how he was raised to believe snipers were 'cowards' since his uncle died by a Japanese sniper shot in World War II. Taking to Twitter in rage, the Fahrenheit 9/11 director seethed: 'My uncle killed by sniper in WW2. We were taught snipers were cowards. Will shoot u in the back. Snipers aren't heroes. And invaders r worse.' Opinion: Seth Rogen compared American Sniper to a fake Nazi propaganda film in a tweet on Sunday . Moore later backtracked those comments on Facebook, writing that he thought the film was well made but could have done a better job at contextualizing the Iraq War. The Oscar-nominated documentary filmmaker wrote a lengthy Facebook post today clarifying his statements, saying they were not intended as a criticism of the movie American Sniper, based on Kyle's bestselling memoir. After an onslaught of criticism, Moore tweeted again today to claim he was not talking about either Kyle or the film, pointing out the fact that he didn't mention either directly in his tweets. 'Hmm. I never tweeted 1word bout AmericaSniper/ChrisKyle. I said my uncle killed by sniper in WWII; only cowards would do that 2 him, others,' he said. He went on to write about his mixed-feelings towards the film in a protracted Facebook post, saying that while some aspects of the movie were praise-worthy, director Clint Eastwood didn't cover the history surrounding the Iraq War to Moore's liking. 'Awesome performance from Bradley Cooper. One of the best of the year. Great editing. Costumes, hair, makeup superb! 'Oh... and too bad Clint gets Vietnam and Iraq confused in his storytelling. And that he has his characters calling Iraqis ""savages"" throughout the film. This is what I really meant: Seth Rogen went online to clarify the difference between 'kinda reminded me' and a direct comparison. He used apples and oranges as an example . 'But there is also anti-war sentiment expressed in the movie. And there's a touching ending as the main character is remembered after being gunned down by a fellow American vet with PTSD who was given a gun at a gun range back home in Texas - and then used it to kill the man who called himself the 'America Sniper'. American Sniper has been nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Actor for Cooper and Best Picture. Seth Rogen's film The Neighbors was eligible for this year's Academy Awards, but was not nominated in any category. Rogen's other film The Interview, nearly banned for fear that screenings of the North Korean-set comedy would be targeted by terrorists, was not eligible for the Oscars since it was released online a day before it premiered in theaters.","Billboard defaced in West Los Angeles on Sunday night according to LAPD .

'It was a large part of my life, so every day that goes by, at some point you'll see something that refers to it, or at least I will, in my life,' he  told Cosmopolitan.com. Side by side: The 33-year-old Murray with the 30-year-old Roemer after a shopping trip at Fred Segal in West Hollywood in October . 'Playing the moral compass for that show, which is what Lucas was, was a great way for me to learn as an artist, and to start understanding emotions and understanding myself.' Recently Bush said on Watch What Happens Live that she didn't want to comment on her ex who she worked with on  One Tree Hill. 'My mother once said to me that if you don't have anything nice to say, not to say anything at all,' the beauty remarked. Once Mr and Mrs Murray: Chad with his One Tree Hill co-star Sophia Bush in 2005; they divorced the next year . Bush, who now stars on Chicago PD, was married to the actor for only five months. The brunette then added, 'We were two stupid kids who had no business being in a relationship in the first place.' The 31-year-old actress also said, 'To all the other costars who've worked it out, more power to you.'

"An ancient Italian scroll that was damaged by a volcanic eruption in 79AD has been deciphered for the first time. Using a form of X-ray imaging, scientists have been able to peer inside it without breaking the fragile papyrus. It is among hundreds of texts retrieved from villa at Herculaneum -  a town that was destroyed when Mount Vesuvius erupted 2,000 years ago. Scroll down for video . The charred papyrus (pictured left) was unfurled using a form of X-ray imaging called X-ray phase contrast tomography. It takes advantage of subtle differences in the way radiation pass through substances. On one fragment (right), researchers spotted words that are thought to be 'would fall', 'would say', and 'to move' The catastrophic event was the same eruption that wiped out Pompeii. Some of the texts from what is called the Villa of the Papyri have been deciphered after being discovered in the 1750s. But many more remain a mystery because they were so badly damaged. It was feared that unrolling the papyrus they were written on would have destroyed them completely. The only distinct marks in documents such as this scroll, said the researchers, are rounded traces - shapes that aren't easily confused with papyrus fibres - running vertically and horizontally. Letters A, B, D, E, Z, Y, K, L, M, N, O, P, C, U, F, X, C and O (a) are easy to decipher. While G, H, I, X, P and T (b) are more easily confused . Vito Mocella, a theoretical scientist at the Institute of Microelectronics and Microsystems in Naples, and his colleagues used a technique called X-ray phase contrast tomography. It has previously been used to examine fossils without damaging them. Phase contrast tomography takes advantage of subtle differences in the way radiation - such as X-rays - pass through different substances, in this case papyrus and ink. The only clearly distinct marks in documents such as this scroll, said the researchers, are rounded or oblique traces - shapes that are not easily confused with papyrus fibres - which run vertically and horizontally. For example, letters are A, B, D, E, Z, Y, K, L, M, N, O, P, C, U, F, X, C and O are easy to decipher. While G, H, I, X, P and T are more easily confused. On one fragment, the sequence of Greek capital letters PIPTOIE could be read, and the researchers believe it may read 'would fall.' In the following line, they believe it reads 'would say', and in a later fragment the researchers identified a sequence that could be words of the verb 'to move.' 'The papyri were completely covered in blazing-hot volcanic material,' said Vito Mocella, a theoretical scientist at the Institute of Microelectronics and Microsystems in Naples who led the latest project. Previous attempts to peer inside the scrolls failed to yield any readable texts because the ink used in ancient times was made from a mixture of charcoal and gum. This makes it indistinguishable from the burned papyrus. The scroll is among hundreds retrieved from the remains of a villa at Herculaneum, which along with Pompeii (preserved victim pictured) was one of several Roman towns that were destroyed when Mount Vesuvius (pictured in background) erupted in 79AD . This map shows the cities and towns affected by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. Herculaneum is pictured to the west of the volcanoe. Pompeii is in the south east. The estimated shape of the ash and cinder is shown by the dark area covering the region . Philodemus of Gadara, born around 35 BC, and was an Epicurean philosopher and poet. Epicurian philosophy, as established by Epicurus (341 to 270 BC), taught that the purpose of life was to enjoy a happy, pain-free, tranquil existence. It also encouraged people to surround themselves with friends and try to live self-sufficiently. Gadara studied in Athens, before moving to Rome, and then to Herculaneum. He is chiefly known for his poetry preserved in the Greek Anthology, but since the 18th century, many writings of his have been discovered among the charred papyrus rolls at the Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum. The task of excavating and deciphering these rolls is difficult, and work continues to this day. Mr Mocella and his colleagues used a technique called X-ray phase contrast tomography, which has previously been used to examine fossils without damaging them. Phase contrast tomography takes advantage of subtle differences in the way radiation - such as X-rays - pass through different substances, in this case papyrus and ink. Using the technology at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, France, the researchers found they were able to decipher several letters in one of the scrolls, proving that the method could be used to read what's hidden inside others. The only clearly distinct marks found inside the document, are rounded or oblique traces - shapes that are not easily confused with papyrus fibres - which run vertically and horizontally, the researchers said. For example, letters are A, B, D, E, Z, Y, K, L, M, N, O, P, C, U, F, X, C and O are easy to decipher. While G, H, I, X, P and T are more easily confused. On one fragment, the sequence of Greek capital letters PIPTOIE could be read, and the researchers believe it may read 'would fall.' Some of the texts recovered from what is called the Villa of the Papyri (ruins pictured) have been deciphered after being discovered in the 1750s. But many more remain a mystery because they were so badly damaged. It was feared that unrolling the papyrus they were written on would have destroyed them completely . The next challenge will be to automate the process of scanning the charred lumps of papyrus (example pictured) and deciphering the texts inside them . In the following line, they believe it reads 'would say', and in a later fragment the researchers identified a sequence that could be words of the verb 'to move.' 'Our goal was to show that the technique is sensitive to the writing,' said Mr Mocella. In a further step, the scientists compared the handwriting to that of other texts, allowing them to conclude it was likely the work of Philodemus, a poet and Epicurean philosopher who died about a century before the volcanic eruption. The next challenge will be to automate the process of scanning the charred lumps of papyrus and deciphering the texts inside them. Once achieved, it will mean 700 further scrolls stored in Naples could be deciphered. Scholars studying the Herculaneum texts said the new technique may well mark a breakthrough for their efforts to unlock the ancient philosophical ideas hidden from view for almost two millennia. 'It's a philosophical library of Epicurean texts from a time when this philosophy influenced the most important classical Latin authors, such as Virgil, Horace and Cicero,' said Juergen Hammerstaedt, a professor of Greek and Latin at the University of Cologne, Germany, who was not involved in the project. 'There needs to be much work before one can virtually unroll carbonized papyrus because one will have to develop a digital method that will allow us to follow the layers,' he said. 'But in the 260 years of Herculaneum papyrology it is certainly a remarkable year.' The findings are published in the journal Nature Communications.","The scroll was retrieved from the remains of a villa at Herculaneum .

"A row between the Labour party and the White House has escalated after Harriet Harman accused Barack Obama of 'not really knowing what is going on'. Labour is furious at the US President's endorsement of David Cameron and the Tory economic election strategy less than four months before the election. Launching her second attack on Mr Obama, Labour's deputy leader insisted he had been wrong to suggest that Britain 'must be doing something right' after strong economic growth. Scroll down for video . Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman insisted the US President had been wrong to suggest that Britain 'must be doing something right' after strong economic growth . Mr Cameron flew to Washington last week for a two-day visit, his last as Prime Minister before the election. The President hailed the British Prime Minister as a 'great friend' and said the US and UK economies were 'standing out' on the world stage. The remarks caused dismay in Labour ranks, who have traditionally had closer ties with the Democrats. Mr Obama was asked whether Britain should 'stick to the plan' and if Mr Cameron is 'right' over his plans for the economy. The President replied: 'I would note that Great Britain and the United States are two economies that are standing out at a time when a lot of other countries are having problems. So we must be doing something right.' On Sunday Ms Harman said Mr Obama had been 'wrong' not to reflect on the impact of crash on personal incomes. Last night she went further, and took a highly unusual swipe at the US President, traditionally seen as Britain's closest ally. US President Barack Obama  handed David Cameron an extraordinary pre-election endorsement, hailing the British Prime Minister as a 'great friend' Ms Harman told LBC Radio: 'If he was saying David Cameron has run the economy in a good way, the impact it will have is most people will feel that Obama does not really know what is going on in this country, and doesn't know that although the figures might show there has been an economic recovery, most people don't feel better off. 'For Obama to say David Cameron is right and everything is fine, I think people will just disagree with President Obama, and think of their own experience. People know their pay have stagnated, and costs have gone up. 'Whatever Cameron or Obama say, the Tories have not run the economy well, and people have lost out, unless you are the very top and have had an absolute bonanza.' Privately senior Labour figures are dismayed at the backing from the US, especially after Ed Miliband hired a senior Obama aide to advise his election campaign. Many in the Labour party had hoped the appointment of Obama election guru David Axelrod would help to secure support from the White House. 'I'm not quite sure why we're paying Axelrod £300,000,' one Labour frontbencher told the Sunday Times. 'We should ask for our money back.' Labour leader Ed Miliband had hoped that a visit to the White House last year, and a meeting with President Obama, would help to prevent a ringing endorsement for Mr Cameron ahead of the election . The Obama endorsement of Mr Cameron came after it emerged the US President refers to the Prime Minister privately as his 'bro'. At a press conference on Friday, the President 'Let me put this speculation to rest: put simply, David is a great friend. He is one of my closest and most trusted partners in the world. 'On many of the challenges we face... we see the world the same way. 'Great Britain is our indispensable partner - and David personally an outstanding partner.' Mr Miliband had hoped that a visit to the White House last year, and a meeting with President Obama, would help to prevent a ringing endorsement for Mr Cameron ahead of the election.","Labour's deputy leader insists people in Britain not feeling the recovery .

"Pupils at a Christian school have been branded bigots after a young boy gave the wrong answer when asked what a Muslim was. Durham Free has been told to close after inspectors branded it an educational failure and said some children displayed ‘discriminatory views’ toward people of other faiths. The boy’s answer to the Muslim question apparently included a reference to terrorism. But teachers said the verdict was grossly unfair and based on a throwaway and ignorant comment made by a single pupil. They said the school’s Christian ethos made it an easy target for officials who wanted to show they were promoting the Government’s diversity agenda. Closing down: Durham Free has been told to close after inspectors branded it an educational failure and said some children displayed ‘discriminatory views’ toward people of other faiths . A second Christian school in the area has been put into special measures. Inspectors also concluded its children were intolerant after allegedly asking ten-year-old pupils what lesbians ‘did’. Teachers at Grindon Hall Christian School in Sunderland said the critical Ofsted report came as a shock because it was performing well. There are claims that some schools – mainly those with a religious ethos or in areas with few ethnic minority pupils – have been put under undue pressure by a requirement to promote British values such as tolerance, fairness, respect for other faiths and the rule of law and democracy. The rules were introduced to combat extremism in the wake of investigations into the Trojan Horse takeover scandal in Birmingham. Prebendary Rod Thomas, of the Reform Council and a member of the General Synod, said the plight of the two schools was disturbing. ‘When the future of entire schools can be prejudiced on the basis of what appear to be a few conversations with individual pupils, it raises very serious concerns,’ he added. Special measures: The headmaster of Grindon Hall Christian School (pictured) said the critical inspection by Ofsted, which was published on the school's website, came as a 'huge shock' to staff, parents and pupils . ‘These two cases highlight important issues about how Ofsted are interpreting the guidance they have been given.’ Simon Calvert of the Christian Institute said: ‘The Government’s British values regime is twisting Ofsted’s priorities out of all proportion. Inspectors are asking all kinds of invasive questions and then issuing reports that the parents whose children attend the school don’t recognise.’ Durham Free School, which has 94 pupils aged 11 to 13, was praised by then education secretary Michael Gove after it opened in September 2013. But when it was inspected in November, Ofsted failed it on a wide range of factors including poor teaching, attainment and behaviour. ‘Standards are low and progress is inadequate,’ inspectors said. ‘Students’ achievement is weak.’ New rules: Guidelines, introduced by the Education Secretary Nicky Morgan (pictured) last year, require schools actively to promote 'British values' including democracy, liberty and tolerance' It will now close at Easter after Education Secretary Nicky Morgan announced her department was withdrawing its funding. The inspecting team, which was led by Joan Hewitt, concluded: ‘Leaders are failing to prepare students for life in modern Britain. Some students hold discriminatory views of other people who have different faiths, values or beliefs from themselves.’ But according to teachers, the team based this view on speaking to the boy of around 12 who was asked about Muslims during a group discussion. His answer included a reference to terrorism. Acting headmaster Julian Eisner, 57, said: ‘The pupil’s reply displayed a very disappointing level of ignorance but, in the context, did not provide evidence of a discriminatory attitude. ‘The school wholeheartedly agreed with Ofsted inspectors that there is progress to be made to guarantee all pupils articulate and share the tolerant attitudes that are embedded in the school’s Christian ethos.’ Petrina Douglas, who is a parent governor, said: ‘It feels like the school has been made a scapegoat. Durham is primarily white British so knowledge of other cultures is not as prevalent. But I don’t think the children are bigoted.’ Chris Gray, principal of Grindon Hall, said: ‘It is now well known that the manner in which inspectors questioned our pupils in November was hostile, inappropriate and raises serious safeguarding issues. Ofsted’s approach to us was negative at every stage, as if the data collected had to fit a predetermined outcome.’ Yesterday, a Department for Education spokesman said of Grindon Hall: ‘This school has been troubled for some time and Ofsted have been monitoring it carefully. This report shows that problems persist and there are continued concerns about leadership, the quality of learning and safeguarding.’ Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said of Durham Free School: ‘It is failing to ensure children are looked after, failing to provide an environment in which children are able to learn and failing to provide the quality of education that we expect.’ Open: Grindon Hall, which teaches pupils aged four to 18, has a Christian ethos but no faith-based selection criteria, resulting in an intake that includes pupils from various religions .","Inspectors said Durham Free School pupils showed 'discriminatory views'

"It's been a harrowing time for residents in the Adelaide Hills over the past few weeks, but one sporting event is trying to show that the area is literally on the on road to recovery. As the peloton of the Tour Down Under sped through burnt bushland on stage one in the Adelaide Hills it was as if new life and colour had been breathed back into the region. The scorched earth and trees were a severe backdrop as some of the world's best cyclists whizzed by, but it also stood for a rebirth of sorts as people continued to get their lives back on track. Scroll down for video . Competitors ride through burnt bushland destroyed in a recent bushfire at Checker Hill in the Adelaide Hills during stage one of the 2015 Tour Down Under .

A stranded koala bear can only cling on for dear life amidst the burnt trees and scorched earth of the Adelaide Hills . But certain precautions had to be made behind the scenes before the competition got the green light. ABC News reported that Tourism Minister Leon Bignell said safety audits had been carried out in the Adelaide Hills along roads in Kersbrook, Gumeracha and Cudlee Creek following last week's bushfires. The safety of the teams and spectators had been the South Australian Government's top priority. ‘We've had the teams out there from the Department of Transport to make sure that trees that were a threat to riders and to spectators have been removed and the path is clear for stages one and three to go ahead in the fire-affected areas,’ he said. It's hoped that the Tour Down Under will raise people's spirits in the Adelaide Hills area after the bushfires . Australia's Richie Porter (right) flies past an area of scorched earth as he leads a breakaway from the peloton . Having the race travel through the Adelaide Hills is a much-needed boost for the fire-affected communities, which face a long recovery period ahead. The publicity given to the area has already resulted in a surge of donations to the Country Fire Service. ‘We see this as a huge boost to the people who have suffered so much angst and worry over the past few days with the bushfire,’ Mr Bignell said. ‘There's still a lot of hard things to be done in the next few weeks and months, perhaps years, for the people in the area, but we wanted to make sure that if there was any possibility at all we would make sure that the race went ahead as scheduled.’ Earlier this month the sight of burning houses could be seen throughout the Adelaide Hills because of bushfires .

The peloton bunches up as it passes through the Adelaide Hills during stage one of the Tour Down Under on Tuesday . The reality of Australia's hot summers and the devastation it can cause would be clear for all to see for those watching the broadcast of the race. 'It will be great for the world to tune in and see that the area is returning to normal,' Mr Bignell said. ‘To see the blackened Australian landscape is something that unfortunately Australians are used to - it happens from time-to-time during our harsh summers - but for people from overseas to see what's happened, it will be a stark contrast to the vineyards and the beautiful coastal views that they normally have of the Tour Down Under.’ Publicity has already resulted in a surge of donations to the Country Fire Service who fought day and night to keep the fires at bay .

"A Melbourne man who is believed to have been killed fighting for ISIS in Syria reportedly only became a jihadist as an excuse to 'be a part of the violence' to satisfy his aggressive nature. It is reported that Mahmoud Abdullatif, known as the 'playboy jihadist', was killed over the weekend. Abdullatif's former girlfriend has come forward, opening up about the man she knew - a bully from Brunswick Secondary College who had a penchant for violence. Scroll down for video . Playboy jihadi: Mahmoud Abdullatif was known for his love of women and fast cars before he became a militant jihadi . It has been reported that Victorian woman Zehra Duman, pictured, had married Abdullatif . Sahini Sendeera, 21, says her ex-boyfriend was a man of extremes. Abdullatif was a rebel and a womaniser who never lived a religious lifestyle, yet was fiercely proud to be a Muslim according to Fairfax Media. 'I think he liked the extreme culture of Islam and I think he just wanted to be a part of the violence,' Ms Senadeera told SMH. 'I think for him Islam was just an excuse to behave like that.' Ms Sendeera explains that his approach to religion incorporated many double standards, purporting to be religious whilst acting aggressively and chasing women in clubs. Abdullatif was called 'Mushi' by his friends and was part of a troublesome group who were all allegedly kicked out of school in Year 11. Both his ex-girlfriend and a former friend, who did not wish to be named, always assumed Abdullatif's misbehaviour was harmless. 'He did have a reputation for being a wannabe badass but I never expected this, I thought he was just full of it,' the friend told Fairfax. However, his former girlfriend does concede that he made friends and admirers because he had a 'really interesting personality'. The message came from a woman purporting to be his wife on Twitter, who marked his death with an apparent celebratory message on Tuesday. 'Till we reunite in Jannatul Firdaws (heaven) my dearest husband,' the account said. 'You won the race! Heart of a green bird insha'Allah habibi<3!' Just a month ago, Abdullatif announced his marriage to the woman, reportedly Victorian woman Zehra Duman, on Twitter. At the time, he also said he hoped for a 'beautiful death. 'I got married today... insha Allah I receive a beautiful death as well. #jihadlife,' he wrote on December 19. Abdullatif was pictured just weeks ago accompanying Sydney militant Mohamed Elomar and a friend. Pictured: Mahmoud Abdullatif was reported killed in the Middle East . The image was captioned on social media: 'Aussie reunion in the land of khalifah (caliphate).' Abdullatif's purported killing is the latest in a spate of Australian deaths in the Middle East. Mohammad Ali Baryalei, a mid-level Islamic State commander, was reported dead in October. Authorities believed Baryalei responsible for the recruitment of as many as half of the Australians fighting for the Islamic State.","Wife reports Mahmoud Abdullatif, of Melbourne, has been killed .

"Gatwick Airport have unveiled plans which they say will 'elimate' airport queues and speed up boarding times. The Sussex airport will be the 'world's most efficient two-runway airport' if new designs created by British architect Sir Terry Farrell are implemented, bosses claim. The plans are part of the airport's campaign for a second runway. The Airport Commission is due to rule on the best way to maximise the south of England's air capacity and is currently considering the possibility of a second runway at Gatwick or a third at Heathrow. Gatwick have also created a series of adverts to be published this week highlighting that plans are 'comparatively simple and low risk and can be delivered in just 10 years, by 2025'. The new designs aim to eliminate queues with self-service bag drops and electronic security gates, and by helping passengers to reach the boarding gate 30 minutes after arrival. Architect Sir Terry Farrell plans are designed to eliminate queues with long lines of self-service kiosks for printing boarding passes and baggage tags, self-service check in desks and automated security gates . In addition, 'exceptionally' short taxiing times of just seven minutes will reduce operating costs and engine emissions. According to the plans it will mean that Gatwick will be able to match the world’s quickest aircraft turnaround times. Passengers will also be able to connect with flights leaving different terminals in 45 minutes and in 30 minutes from the same terminal. The Gatwick Connect service is already in operation and allows passengers to travel on a combination of independently operated flights and transfer through Gatwick without having to transport their bags through the airport or check-in twice. A spokesman for the airport said: ‘An expanded Gatwick would be the world's most efficient two-runway airport - flexible and responsive to meet the changing needs of passengers and airlines. The Airport Commission is due to rule on the best way to maximise the south of England's air capacity and is currently considering the possibility of a second runway at Gatwick or a third at Heathrow . ‘The plans demonstrate how queues will be eliminated, passenger transit through the airport will be sped up.’ Plans to expand Heathrow airport have also gone on display. Among the options being considered are building an entirely new, third runway. However, separate plans have also been submitted by Heathrow Hub, an independent proposal campaigning to double the size of Heathrow’s existing northern runway to more than four miles, and allowing planes to use either end at the same time. Those behind the campaign say it would cut the noise of flights over London by shifting early morning flights to the new section of tarmac, meaning planes land and take off two and half miles further away from the capital. Plans for new runways at Heathrow and Gatwick are currently being considered by the Airports Commission for expanding UK airport capacity. The commission, led by businessman Sir Howard Davies, is due to issue its final report over the summer. Gatwick chief executive Stewart Wingate said: ‘An expanded Gatwick can be delivered quickly and at no additional cost to the taxpayer so the UK can reap the economic benefits of expansion sooner. ‘The way we travel is changing fast and we have to change with it - only Gatwick can cater for all passengers, travelling to any destination, with any airline type, now and into the future.

Gatwick Connect is already in operation and allows passengers traveling on two independently operated flights to transfer through the airport without having to transport their bags. ‘Gatwick Connect - our ground-breaking service - is an example of us already responding to changing passenger behaviour and the needs of passengers will remain central to our plan to expand.’ Sir Terry Farrell added: ‘Queues have literally been designed out and the new terminal will be simple and convenient to use with few changes of level. ‘The airfield itself would also offer the shortest taxiing distances possible with the new apron sitting between, and in close-proximity to, both the existing and new runways.’","Gatwick chiefs have submitted expansion plans to the Airport Commission .

"The Pope has confirmed he will visit both New York and Washington DC as part of a trip to the U.S. later this year. The Vatican had previously announced that the Pontiff would visit Philadelphia to participate in a massive rally for Catholic families in September. But speaking to reporters on a plane returning to Rome at the end of a trip to Sri Lanka and the Philippines yesterday, Francis said he would be visiting the two cities for the first time since becoming head of the Roman Catholic Church. Scroll down for video . Pope Francis addressing journalists on the papal plane on his way back to Rome after visiting Manila as part of a week long trip to Asia. Here he confirmed he would be visiting Washington and New York later this year . The itinerary for the trip is yet to be finalised but it is expected that he could visit the White House and address Congress as well as speak at the United Nations in New York. It is also believed he could give a mass in Madison Square Garden and visit Ground Zero. However, it has been confirmed that when in the U.S. capital he will take part in a ceremony to cannonise Junipero Serra, an 18th century Spanish Franciscan priest. There had been speculation that the Pope could have included a stop in California as part of his U.S. visit, especially as Serra founded missions in the state. But the 79-year-old said: 'I would like to go to California for the canonisation of Junipero, but I think there is the problem of time. It requires two more days.' He then said that the sainthood ceremony would take place at the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception instead. Serra was born on the Spanish island of Majorca in 1713, went to the Americas in the middle of the 18th century and led one of the first Franciscan missions in California. He arrived in San Diego in 1769 and spent most of the rest of his life there before dying at a mission in Carmel near Monterey in 1784. Meanwhile the city of Philadelphia has already begun preparations for the Pontiff's visit in September, which will coincide at the end of the week long World Meeting of Families. There had been speculation that Pope Francis was set to visit California but he told journalists on the flight that there wouldn't be enough time . It is expected that 1.5 million people could turn out for an open air Mass on the steps of the city's main art museum and that the crowd could fill a one-and-a-half mile stretch of parkway along the Schuylkill River. Francis also disclosed proposed trips to Africa, in particular the Central African Republic and Uganda, which would most likely take place at the end of 2015 to avoid the rainy seasons. There are also plans to visit Ecuador, Bolivia and Chile, most likely in July. He also confirmed he hoped to visit Argentina, Chile and Uruguay in 2016 — and Peru at some point. The announcement of his travel plans comes after the pope addressed a record six million Catholics in Manila on Sunday as his Asian pilgrimage drew to a close. On the flight back to the Vatican, he also spoke of how Catholics 'shouldn't breed like rabbits' and should instead practice 'responsible parenting'. While firmly upholding church teaching banning contraception, Francis said there are plenty of church-approved ways to regulate births. But he said most importantly, no outside institution should impose its views on regulating family size, blasting what he called the 'ideological colonization' of the developing world. Pope Francis, pictured yesterday as he departed Villamor Airbase in Manila, says Catholics do not have to breed 'like rabbits' African bishops, in particular, have long complained about how progressive Western ideas about birth control and gay rights are increasingly being imposed on the developing world by groups, institutions or individual nations, often as a condition for development aid. He said: 'Every people deserves to conserve its identity without being ideologically colonized.' The Pope's comments, taken together with his defence of the Catholic Church's ban on artificial contraception during the trip, could be a signal that a more conservative side to the pope is emerging.","Pope Francis has confirmed he is set to visit New York and Washington .

"An Alabama man was fined after being pulled over by police in Georgia for 'eating while driving'. Madison Turner, a computer software engineer, almost choked on his food after being told by police the reason for him being stopped was for consuming fast food whilst in the fast lane. The officer wrote him up under Georgia's distracted driving law which states: 'a driver shall exercise due care in operating a motor vehicle on the highways of this state and shall not engage in any actions which shall distract such driver from the safe operation of such vehicle.' Mr Turner has said he will fight the ticket when he goes to court next month. Scroll down for video . Hard to swallow: Madison Turner from Alabama says he was issued a ticket in Cobb County, Georgia, last week for snacking on a just-bought burger while he was behind the wheel . Cheesed off: The officer wrote him up under Georgia's distracted driving law, saying Turner was 'eating while driving' in the ticket's comments sections . Meanwhile, lawyers familiar with Georgia's road rules say the incident is the first they've heard of anyone being prosecuted over eating whilst being behind the wheel. They believe the ticket will be tossed when it comes to court. Mr Turner had ordered a double quarter-pounder with cheese from McDonald's last week when the officer pulled him over along Canton Road in Marietta. Should have dined-in: 'The officer explained to me that he observed me eating a burger for 2 miles,' Madison said. 'He said specifically three times, you can't just go down the road eating a hamburger' Both hands on the wheel! Lawyers say unless eating the burger caused an accident, there really should have been no problem with munching on a tasty burger while driving down the road . 'The officer explained to me that he observed me eating a burger for 2 miles,' Madison told WSB-TV. 'He said specifically three times, you can't just go down the road eating a hamburger.' Distraction? Georgia's distracted driving law is vague and the ticket will likely be tossed in court . 'Maybe I was enjoying the burger too much I needed to tone it down. I was certainly willing to do so but I didn't expect to be fined or punished,' Madison said. Lawyers say  the only time someone might be prosecuted under the law would be if an accident had occurred as a result of eating behind the wheel. 'I've only seen something like this charge when there's an accident,' William Head, a longtime traffic and DUI attorney said. 'There was no accident here so the fact that this man was charged with eating and driving is a first for me,' Cobb County police have so far refused to comment on the case, although experts agree the law is exceptionally vague. It is not clear how much Madison was fined.","Man was eating a cheeseburger when cops pulled him over .

"A notebook revealing Alan Turing's mind-boggling calculations as he battled to crack the Enigma code during the Second World War is expected to fetch £600,000 at auction . A notebook revealing Alan Turing's mind-boggling calculations as he battled to crack the Enigma code during the Second World War is expected to fetch £600,000 at auction. The book - which has never been seen in public before - dates from 1942 when he was working at Bletchley Park to break the Nazi code. It contains 56 pages of handwritten workings and provides a remarkable insight into the thought process of a genius. In the pad, bought in Cambridge, Mr Turing writes about how extremely difficult it is to understand the Leibniz notation. He wrote: 'The Leibniz notation I find extremely difficult to understand in spite of it having been the one I understood the best once! It certainly implies that some relation between x and y has been laid down eg, y=x2+3x?' The colourful covered notebook is made up of complicated mathematical workings and is split into three parts - with the first two sections consisting of Mr Turing's maths notes. The third part belongs to Robin Gandy, a friend and fellow mathematician, who was handed the notebook by Mr Turing. Mr Gandy, who donated most of Mr Turing's papers to the archive at King's College, Cambridge, kept the notebook and wrote deeply personal dream sequences in it at the request of his psychiatrist. The notebook's now anonymous owner has decided to sell the notebook on April 13 at Bonhams' Fine Books and Manuscripts sale in New York.

It is expected to fetch a staggering £620,000. A portion of the proceeds will go to charity. Andrew Hodges, a leading Turing scholar, said: 'Alan Turing was parsimonious with his words and everything from his pen has special value. 'This notebook shines extra light on how, even when he was enmeshed in great world events, he remained committed to free-thinking work in pure mathematics.' Mr Turing is regarded by many as one of Britain's most talented mathematicians. But despite playing a starring role in the Second World War he was later treated as a pariah. In 1952, he was prosecuted for homosexual acts and, to avoid jail and 'cure' his homosexuality, he was chemically castrated. A biopic on the tragic genius called The Imitation Game was last week nominated for eight Oscars with Benedict Cumberbatch, pictured above, in the running for the Best Actor gong . As a result of his conviction, Mr Turing lost his security clearance so could no longer continue his code-breaking. He committed suicide two years later and it wasn't until 2013 that he was pardoned.

"Capturing the beauty of nature used to require some serious kit - a dedicated camera complete with an array of state-of-the art lenses. But the professional's monopoly on breathtaking nature photography could be about to be over. News photographer Mikael Buck has captured a stunning portfolio of images using just his smartphone as a camera - although he does rely on a detachable lens to zoom in on ice crystals on leaves and insects' hypnotic multi-faceted eyes. Renowned news photographer Mikael Buck created stunning images by using his smartphone and a lens attachment. This picture shows the head of a purple emperor butterfly on show at the Haslemere Museum in Surrey, including its proboscis - a tubular mouth part used for feeding and sucking . His photos show the iridescent cells of dragonfly wings, furry antennae and ice crystals forming on leaves, which were shot in the woods of London's Hampstead Heath. The London-based photographer used Sony’s QX1 lens-style camera, which retails at around £250. It clips onto a smartphone or tablet, as well as a tripod to keep his smartphone steady while talking the close-up shots. The first set of images taken on Hampstead Heath, show crisp ice crystals forming on leaves, which would be almost impossible to capture with a standard smartphone camera. Mr Buck used the QX1 and an extra macro lens to reveal the intricate ice structures and kept the same set up to photograph beetles and butterflies in microscopic detail at the Haslemere Museum, which has over 65,000 insects in its collection.

The London-based photographer used Sony’s QX1 lens-style camera, which is designed to work with a smartphone or tablet, as well as a tripod (pictured) to keep his smartphone steady when talking the close-up shots . He photographed the cellular structure of a golden ring dragonfly's wings, hairs on the bottom of a common green birdwing butterfly's wings, a close up of a purple emperor butterfly's eyes and the iridescence on the wings of the same species. The QX1 works with a smartphone or tablet. It can be used with camera lenses from any manufacturer with the aid of an adapter and costs £249 ($377). Mr Buck said: ‘Being an editorial photographer, I am used to capturing pictures on a DSLR to accompany the daily headlines so to use something like the QX1 was certainly a change. ‘The sheer detail that can be captured using this lens-style camera is incredible’ Mr Buck said ‘The sheer detail that can be captured using this lens-style camera [the QX1] is incredible’. Here, ice crystals are pictured up close in the undergrowth of Hampstead Heath, London. They almost look like something from a chemistry experiment . Tiny hairs on the bottom of a common green birdwing butterfly's wings are pictured left, together with a close-up of the insect's head (right). Here you can see its compound eyes, which allow butterflies to see ultraviolet light as well as a mosaic view of the world around them . Mr Buck said: ‘Using the QX1 and macro lenses I was able to capture shots of everything from the individual crystals of ice on a frost covered leaf (pictured) to the tiny cells on a dragonfly's wings’ ‘Although the cameras in smartphones are getting better all the time, there is a whole world of microscopic detail that you could never photograph with them until now due to the limited nature of their fixed lenses. ‘Using the QX1 and macro lenses I was able to capture shots of everything from the individual crystals of ice on a frost covered leaf to the tiny cells on a dragonfly's wings.’ He said that the tool enables photographers to leave the house with just their phone and a lens, and still be able to take SLR quality images. ‘ It can be remotely controlled using your smart-phone so you can get all kinds of weird and wonderful angles that you simply wouldn't think to try with a larger camera,’ Mr Buck added. This is the set-up Mt Buck used to capture his icy images in Hampstead heath. You can see his smartphone with the QX1 lens-style camera clipped on (the black part) onto which a large macro lens is also attached, making his gear more than a little bit different from using a standard smartphone camera .

"A fluffy red hat with an ostrich feather which was allegedly thrown in triumph by Henry VIII after his army won a siege in 1544 is set to go on display after being bought for £12,000. The Tudor headwear is set to go on show at Hampton Court Palace in Richmond, Greater London, after the curators acquired it from descendants of Nicholas Bristowe - the courtier who apparently caught it after it was hurled into the air by the king. It is thought Mr Bristowe, who was the king's clerk of the wardrobe, held on to the hat and passed it down through his generations. It has been in his family for the last 470 years. The fluffy red hat, which comes complete with an ostrich feather, will go on display at Hampton Court Palace after being bought for £12,000. It is thought to have been caught after being thrown by Henry VIII in 1544 . It is believed King Henry VII threw the hat in the air in triumph after learning that the fortified city of Boulogne had surrendered to his army, which he led in France in 1544. It was said to be caught by Nicholas Bristowe . The hat, which is made from silver and silk, is now set to go on display at Hampton Court after Historic Royal Palaces, which runs the palace, splashed out £12,000 for it. Eleri Lynn, dress creator for Historic Royal Palaces, said there was no proper evidence to suggest the hat was ever worn by Henry VIII. However, she said the Bristowes' story was acknowledged in a document in the 19th Century. She said it was quite possible that Nicholas Bristowe did obtain the hat from the king, as he was present at Henry VIII's side when he learned that the fortified city of Boulogne had surrendered to his army, which he led in France in 1544. Ms Lynn told The Times: 'It's really tempting to believe it. As a historian you can't say it's Henry's hat, but on this occasion I can't say that it's not because this courtier was so well connected. 'There's every possibility that Henry did throw this hat up into the air and that Nicholas Bristowe caught it. 'We have evidence that it was documented in the family from before the Victorian era, which is great, because the Victorian era is when fakes really started rolling out.' The hat will go on display at Hampton Court Palace (pictured) after the palace's curators bought it for £12,000 . The Siege of Boulogne took place between 19 July and 18 September 1544, during the third invasion of France by Henry VIII. It came to an end after the British dug tunnels underneath the citadel’s walls, forcing the French to surrender. It is thought that upon learning of this victory Henry VIII threw the hat into the air, which was then caught by Bristowe. Records confirm that the courtier was in Boulogne at the time of the siege, making the tale a real possibility. The fluffy hat comes complete with a green ostrich feather, a silver-braid button and features small holes all around the edge which is where the jewels would have sat. The accessory was handed to London auctioneers Christie's in 2007 for £100,000 but it failed to reach its reserve price. It will now go on display to members of the public at Hampton Court in 2016, after it has undergone conservation work. 'Larger than life': A portrait of King Henry VIII . Born at Greenwich Palace in 1491, Henry VIII was the third child and second son of Henry VII and his wife. Only three of his six siblings survived infancy - and he succeeded his father as king following his death on 22 April, 1509. Under Henry VIII's reign, England turned in favour of Protestantism and split from Rome, the Royal Navy built up a fleet of about 50 ships and the country invaded France. Henry VIII was well known for his six marriages, all of which ended in some sort of tragedy - divorce or death - but the Tudor king was also known for other, stranger things. He was known to self-medicate, even going as far as making his own medicines. A record on a prescription for ulcer treatment in the British Museum reads: 'An Oyntment devised by the kinges Majesty made at Westminster, and devised at Grenwich to take away inflammations and to cease payne and heale ulcers called gray plaster.' He was also a musician and composer, owning 78 flutes, 78 recorders, five bagpipes, and has since had his songs covered by Jethro Tull. Many are unaware that he died while heavily in debt, after having such a lavish lifestyle and spending far, far more than taxes would earn him. He also possessed the largest tapestry collection ever documented, and 6,500 pistols. While most portraits show him as a slight man, he was actually very large, with one observer calling him 'an absolute monster'.","Red hat with ostrich feather said to have been thrown in air by Henry VIII .

"Trust in politicians is so low less than half of voters think a party leader would pay back a loan of £10. Only 49 per cent thought Tory David Cameron would return a tenner and just 40 per cent believed Ukip's Nigel Farage would honour his debt, according to Edelman's annual Trust Barometer. It found the UK was languishing in the 'trust doldrums', with barely a third of people thinking parties would do 'what is right'. The trust survey reveals less than half of voters think party leaders would pay back a loan of £10 . With the general election less than four months away, no one partyt has established a lead on trust, and voter trust in every party has fallen over the past year, the survey found. Asked if they would expect to get back £10 note lent to a party leader, Mr Cameron came top on 49 per cent, followed by Labour leader Ed Miliband on 48 per cent and Lib Dem Nick Clegg on 44 per cent. Only 40 per cent trusted Mr Farage and 35 per cent thought Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon would pay the £10. When voters were asked which party they would trust 'to do what is right', Conservatives, Labour and Greens were neck-and-neck on 36 per cent, with Tories down one point, Labour down five and Greens down two since a similar survey last year. They were ahead of Ukip on 27 per cent (down two), Liberal Democrats on 25 per cent (down six), the SNP on 20 per cent (down three) and Plaid Cymru on 15 per cent (down seven). Mr Cameron came top on 49 per cent, followed by Labour leader Ed Miliband on 48 per cent and Lib Dem Nick Clegg on 44 per cent . Only 40 per cent trusted Mr Farage and 35 per cent thought Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon would pay the £10 . London mayor Boris Johnson came out top when participants were asked which individual politicians they trusted to do the right thing, on 39 per cent (down four). He was ahead of leadership rival Mr Cameron on 34 per cent (up one), Mr Miliband on 29 per cent (down four), Mr Farage on 28 per cent (up three) and Mr Clegg on 23 per cent (down four). Some 66 per cent said they would trust Mr Johnson to 'speak his mind' and 61 per cent said the same of Mr Farage. But when asked if they could be trusted to 'communicate honestly', scores plummeted to 42 per cent for the London mayor and 31 per cent for the Ukip leader. Edelman said the UK was languishing in the 'trust doldrums', with trust in Government rising by just one point to 43 per cent over the past year. Meanwhile trust in business fell four points to 52 per cent, with the media dropping three points to 38 per cent and non-governmental agencies such as charities sliding 16 points to 51 per cent. With average trust in its major institutions below 50 per cent, Edelman classed the UK in a group of countries it terms 'the distrusters', alongside Italy, South Africa, Poland and Russia. Top of the Edelman ranking for countries with the most trusted institutions were the United Arab Emirates, India, Indonesia and China, while Ireland and Japan were bottom. 'Key institutions in the UK such as government, media and business have had a better year than previous years, but that has not been converted into increased levels of trust,' said Edelman's UK and Ireland chief executive Ed Williams. 'There is no doubt that we are stuck in a rut.There is a real danger that the years of continuing low trust have permanently rewired our attitudes towards the institutions that shape our lives. It is becoming increasingly difficult for us to navigate out of the trust doldrums.' Edelman questioned 33,000 people in 27 countries between October 13 and November 24 for the Trust Barometer, including 1,000 in the UK.","Survey examines voters' trust levels in politicians around the world .

"Helder Pina was jailed for three years and banned from driving for four after he admitted causing death by dangerous driving on August 1 last year . A Portuguese driver who killed a British grandfather after crashing into him at more than double the speed limit has been jailed. Helder Pina claimed he was not used to driving on the left when he ploughed into Christopher Willmott last August. The grandfather, 48, died after being catapulted 187ft (57m) into the air when he was struck by Pina's car. The 34-year-old Portuguese immigrant, who had  arrived in Britain just three weeks earlier, had been travelling at between 63mph and 67mph when he lost control as he attempted to overtake a group of cyclists, a court heard. Pina's new Peugeot 206 careened off the road straight into  Mr Willmott who as waiting for a taxi at 1.30am on August 1. On Monday Pina was jailed for three years and banned from driving for four years after he admitted causing death by dangerous driving at Worcester Crown Court. The family of Mr Willmott has since blasted the 'disgusting' sentence. Judge Michael Cullum told Pina the crash was 'entirely' his fault which had caused the death of a 'hard working and devoted family man.' The court heard Mr Willmott, of Worcester, was with a couple and their eight-year-old son who had all waiting for a taxi after returning from night fishing on the Worcester canal. His friend Thomas Towers managed to pull partner Linda Finch and their young son to safety but Mr Willmott was unable to get out of the way. A court heard the Peugeot hit the kerb and lost a wheel before it careered into Mr Willmott at between 63mph and 67mph. Shocking CCTV footage of the crash, which was aired in court, showed the skilled kitchen fitter being 'catapulted' along the road in Blackpole, Worcester. Pina then sped across a junction where he struck a lamppost before eventually coming to a halt 984ft (300m) away. The court heard Pina had passed his test in Portugal in 2012 but had not driven on the left-hand side of the road until he bought the Peugeot three weeks before the crash. Christopher Willmott, 48, was waiting for a taxi when Pina ploughed into him at more than twice the legal speed limit in a 30mph zone, killing him . Pina then sped across a junction where he struck a lamppost (pictured) before eventually coming to a halt 984ft (300m) away . Shockingly, he was stopped by police on the first night he had driven it because he was swerving all over the road. Prosecutor Iain Willis said Pina, of Worcester, told officers he was having difficulty with the controls and gear stick being on a different side. He told the court his inexperience behind the wheel could have contributed to the crash. Pina had been working at Worcester Bosch between 3.30pm and 1am and was giving work-mate Elio Soares a lift home at the time of the crash. Mr Soares, who had minor injuries, told police he shouted at his colleague to brake but he just held on to the wheel as the car 'zig-zagged' across the road. Pina first arrived from Portugal in 2007 and settled in the UK permanently in 2012. Nicholas Berry, defending, said he stayed at the scene and helped to call ambulance after the . crash. He added: 'There is nothing I can sensibly say to express the sorry he feels for the tragic events.' Speaking after the hearing, Mr Willmott's family hit out at the three-year sentence - branding it 'disgusting'. Too late: Track marks show where Pina's new Peugot 206 left the road after he control of the car as he tried to overtake a group of cyclists . Tributes left at the scene to the father-of-three, Mr Willmott, whose family hit out at Pina's three-year sentence after the sentencing claiming it was much too short . Ex-wife Karen Willmott, 46, said: 'To drive like that and to take someone's life and then to be allowed out in 18 months, it's not enough. 'I thought it (the sentence) was disgusting.' His brother Dave Willmott, 46, added: 'This is not going to make it any easier. I personally don't think we have had justice today.' Mr Willmott leaves behind three children, Andrew, 27, Carley, 25 and Danielle, 21. He had planned to stop night fishing at 10pm but tragically stayed later because he caught a large 10lb fish. Speaking last year, his daughter Danielle said: 'He said it was the best thing I have ever done having the kids and his grandkids. 'He was always smiling, laughing and joking and he would do anything for anybody. He was one of the best blokes, he wouldn't hurt a fly . 'I don't think I want to get married ever because he's not there to walk me down the aisle. He was a very proud dad.'","Helder Pina was doing 67mph when he ploughed into Christopher Willmott .

"Found guilty: Ben Moynihan, 18, of Portsmouth, Hampshire, compared himself to serial killers . A teenage boy attempted to murder three women who he attacked in random stabbing attacks out of revenge because he could not lose his virginity, it was revealed today. Ben Moynihan, 18, of Portsmouth, Hampshire, compared himself to serial killers and was found guilty at Winchester Crown Court of the three charges. The teenager stabbed the three women, aged 20, 45 and 67, as they walked alone in the Hampshire city in June and July last year. Kerry Maylin, prosecuting, said that Moynihan, who called himself the ‘unhappy geezer’, left two letters for the police confessing to his crimes in which he stated that ‘all women need to die’ and that he liked to smell the ‘flesh he had ripped out’. The letter, left on a police van, stated: ‘All women needs to die and hopefully next time I can gouge their eyeballs out. Every time I stab someone I run home and I like to smell the flesh I ripped out. Come and arrest me for God sake before I hunt for my fourth victim [sic].’ At the bottom of the letter, Moynihan had included a photograph of himself. He was later arrested when police officers recognised him in the street from the picture and detained him. Another letter was found by a couple in which Moynihan described himself as ‘the unhappy geezer’. 'Catch me if you can': Moynihan left two letters for the police confessing to his crimes in which he stated that 'all women need to die' and that he liked to smell the 'flesh he had ripped out' This letter had a symbol from the Tomb Raider game on it. It said: ‘When women won't talk to you it's heartbreaking, why are they fussy with men nowadays.’ It continued: ‘I roam these streets, hungry for blood and pain, I be greeted with attack, attack, attack, attack, dead, jolly good!’ At the bottom of the letter was a symbol from the video game, Ms Maylin said. She continued that after his arrest, Moynihan told a police officer: ‘It was not GBH, I was trying to kill them.’ In a video found on his laptop, Moynihan had filmed himself saying: ‘I think every girl is a type of slut, they are fussy with men nowadays, they do not give boys like us a chance. Tomb Raider symbol: Another letter was found by a couple in which Moynihan described himself as ‘the unhappy geezer’ ‘I am still a virgin, everyone is losing it before me, that's why you are my chosen target. I just can't live in this flat, I have no future here. So women, tell me how we should do this.’ Ms Maylin said he waved a knife at the camera as he continued saying: ‘Shall I stab you in the neck or in the heart, shall I slash your throat or should I just cigarette lighter you or just fire you. Moynihan mocked police in their attempts to track him down, leaving notes on their patrol cars with a photograph of himself. In one note to officers he described police as ‘pathetic’ and wrote in capitals ‘CATCH ME IF YOU CAN’. He referred to himself as the ‘unhappy geezer’ and how he picked targets because he was a virgin. The court heard how he decided to leave a second note to officers mocking them under the windshield of a police cruiser after they arrested a 30-year-old man in his place. In his typed letter, he said: ‘You Police men are very pathetic. I was the one who stabbed all 3 women in the last few weeks. 20th June, 29th June and 11th July. ‘Now you arrest someone who is 30, I’m only 17 for crying out loud. All women need to die. ‘I’m now going to show you a picture of myself and see how good you guys can be, come and arrest me for god sake before I hunt for my 4th victim. CATCH ME IF YOU CAN!’ ‘I do not know where I could get petrol from but how hard can it be to come by. So I hope you learn a lesson not to bully guys like us, we deserve dignity, for your own generations, remember.’ In another document, Moynihan had written: ‘I was planning to murder, mainly women, as an act of revenge because the life they gave me. ‘I am still a virgin at 17 and why do women have to be fussy with choosing a boyfriend or cheating on men with others? 'I attack women because I grew up to believe them a more weaker part of the human breed. ‘I also done it to get out of this horrible life with more stress and to save myself and my family. I am not a bad child and didn't want to do this but had no choice.’ Ms Maylin said he also kept what he called a ‘diary of evil’ which detailed the attacks as well as a document listing his dreams which included dreams of violence against women and of killing. Following the guilty verdicts, Ms Maylin said: ‘It is very disturbing to think that a 17-year-old boy would write on a college computer how he would, 11 weeks later carry out attacks on women as an act of revenge against them. ‘He did not know the three women he attacked on June 20 and 29 and July 11, 2014. He told the police and the court that he would have carried on with attacks and on the day of his arrest was ‘hunting for his fourth victim’. He targeted women and chose to attack increasingly older women whom he thought would not survive his attacks. Investigation: Police search woods in the Hilsea area of Portsmouth in June 2014 after a woman was stabbed . The prosecutor added: ‘The jury at Winchester Crown Court heard that Ben Moynihan had an incomprehensible fascination for killing and heard how he would compare himself to serial killers. ‘The court was shown a video that the defendant had recorded of himself, where he asked women whether he should kill them by slashing their throats or by stabbing them in their hearts. ‘The most chilling document was his “diary of evil”, written during the period of the attacks, in which he declared: “I was planning to murder mainly women as an act of revenge because of the life they gave me, I'm still a virgin at 17. ‘“And why do women have to be fussy when choosing a boyfriend, or cheating on them with others? I attack women because I grew up to believe them as a more weaker part of the human breed. ‘“I also done it to get out of this horrible life with more stress and to save myself and my family, I'm not a bad child and didn't want to do this but have no choice”. Home area: Moynihan, who was 17 at the time of the attacks but is now 18, lived on this road in Portsmouth . ‘It was clear that the attacks were premeditated. We would like to thank the victims who had the courage to come forward and give statements to the police.’ Describing the attacks, Ms Maylin said: ‘Over three days in the summer of 2014, three women were randomly attacked by a stranger. ‘They did not know each other and there is nothing to connect or link them to each other, they are all of different backgrounds, different social circles and significantly of different ages.’ She said that Moynihan used a 4.5in knife to carry out the attacks. Before carrying out his crimes, he researched serial killers including Moors murderer Ian Brady, the Muswell Hill murderer Dennis Nilsen and American Jeffrey Dahmer. The judge, Mr Justice Jay has adjourned the case for sentencing on a date to be set and asked for pre-sentence reports to be prepared on Moynihan.","Ben Moynihan from Portsmouth compared himself to serial killers .

"Edward Snowden has thrown a ‘huge rock’ at the intelligence agencies – and his leaks mean a terrorist atrocity was now certain to ‘get through’, according to the former head of MI6. Sir John Sawers’ warning came as Al Qaeda posted a YouTube video showing fanatics how to avoid detection, apparently based on the former CIA officer’s leaks. Yesterday, former MI6 boss Sir John said the revelations had made the technology companies more reluctant to co-operate with the police and spy agencies. Ex MI6 boss Sir John Sawers (pictured) warned Edward Snowden has thrown 'huge rock' at intelligence agencies, meaning a terrorist atrocity is now certain to 'get through' Security officials fear this has created ‘no-go areas’ on the internet where terrorists can plot atrocities undetected. Sir John warned that, unless a ‘new compact’ could be agreed between web firms and the intelligence agencies, attacks like those in Paris earlier this month would become ‘a more regular feature of our lives’. He said: ‘Snowden threw a massive rock in the pool. The ripples from that have still not died down. ‘It was certainly a great concern for me that the, if you like, informal co-operation that worked well between most technology companies and communication companies and security services was broken by the Snowden revelations and has not been repaired.’ Sir John added: ‘The security community has done a fantastic job keeping threats at bay, but if I was to sit here and ask “will the goalkeepers of the police and security services foil every single attempt to score a goal?”, the answer is no. At some point a threat will get through.’ British security officials have long warned the Snowden revelations could be used to produce a ‘handbook for terrorists’. The chilling seven-and-a-half minute video by Al Qaeda – which includes news footage of Snowden’s massive security breach – confirms these worst fears. The recording provides detailed graphics on how extremists can avoid being trapped by ‘FBI secret spying technology’ when communicating. Extracts from the video by Al Qaeda – and the corresponding leaks by treacherous former CIA officer Edward Snowden (pictured right): . SNOWDEN LEAK: NSA and GCHQ are harvesting millions of emails, instant messaging contact lists and details of internet browsing histories. AL QAEDA ADVICE: ‘All your calls, messages and internet history are stored in this same place… spies have access to these files and can know your daily routine, friends and what you are planning to do tomorrow night at that tall building….’ SNOWDEN LEAK: Western agencies have the capacity to track and map the location of cell phones. AL QAEDA ADVICE: ‘All mobile phone providers use the same software, your device continuously is in contact with the nearest tower… As you are moving around your different coordinates are tracked and stored.’ SNOWDEN LEAK: Security officials were paying private tech companies for ‘clandestine access’ to their communications networks. AL QAEDA GUIDANCE: The video warns Al Qaeda agents that spies are working with internet companies and lists networks which have been co-operating so they can be avoided. It also claims to identify technology companies which are co-operating with the UK and other countries so they can be avoided. There is a list of software packages that can be used to try to thwart GCHQ and the intelligence agencies. The video is spoken in Arabic but with English subtitles. It says: ‘Allah created us with a unique voice, this can be used to track you anywhere no matter [sic] you buy a new phone, SIM card or satellite. 'We will now show you some different ways how the enemy can track you and have a view at some modern war technologies.’ It added: ‘Every mujahed that does not take the right precautions can be a tool in the hand of the enemy. With his phone, tablet or laptop the enemy can listen/record all conversations and meetings.’ Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg (left) is blocking proposals to give Britain's spooks the power to monitor what people browse on the internet and who they are emailing . Experts said Snowden – feted as a hero by some campaigners – had inspired the tape. Sir John’s speech yesterday, his first since stepping down last November, was the second time in a week an ex-head of the intelligence agencies has attacked Snowden. Last Tuesday, ex-MI5 boss Jonathan Evans said the revelations have left Britain less able to protect itself at a time when the terrorist threat from Islamist fanatics is surging. In the wake of the Paris attacks, David Cameron vowed that a new Tory government would introduce 'comprehensive' legislation to ensure there is no 'safe space' for terrorists to communicate over the internet. The Prime Minister said security and intelligence agencies need 'robust powers' to protect the public from violent extremists. Mr Cameron had already indicated he would seek to revive measures in the abandoned draft communications data bill - dubbed the 'snoopers' charter' by critics - enabling the agencies to track emails and other online communications. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg is blocking the bill - insisting it gives the security services too much power to snoop on the public. Snowden, who was a computer specialist at an intelligence centre in Hawaii, tricked colleagues into handing over passwords so he could copy up to 1.7million files in one of the biggest leaks in US history. The defence contractor claims he had to act because the US government’s policies were a ‘threat to democracy’. He fled to Hong Kong, then Russia, where he was granted asylum and now lives in a secret location. Speaking at the London launch of the Edelman Trust Barometer, an international survey of public trust in institutions, Sir John said: 'We have seen a trend over the last few years of the threat rising, the formal threat level has gone up which says that a terrorist attack is highly likely. 'That is not saying an attempted terrorist attack is highly likely. It is saying a terrorist attack getting through is highly likely and we have to take those words at face value.' He also backed the Prime Minister’s assertion last week that there cannot be ‘no-go areas’ online or in other types of communications. He added: 'The prime minister must have been right when he was saying last week that you cannot afford to have complete no-go areas. 'We cannot have no-go areas in our communities where the police cannot go, because that just allows space room for the evil doers to ply their trades. It is the same in the virtual world. 'If you allow areas which are completely impenetrable, then, okay, you might feel comfortable that your communications are private and no one else can see them, but so are those who are trying to do you down and undermine your society.' But the warning will be seen as a direct rebuke to the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg who is blocking proposals to give Britain's spooks the power to monitor what people browse on the internet and who they are emailing.","Sir John Sawers said a terrorist atrocity was now certain to 'get through'

"FOX News has come under international fire with the revelation that the network has made a very unlikely, yet highly powerful, new foe - the city of Paris. Mayor Anne Hidalgo sat down for her first international interview since the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack on Tuesday, telling Christiane Amanpour that it was her intent to go after the polarizing news organization for 'attacking the honor and the image' of the city in statements made in the wake of this tragedy. More specifically, the decision by the network to introduce the anti-Muslim myth that Paris, and most of Europe, had become filled with areas they referred to as 'no go zones,' which were off limits to everyone but Muslims - including police and government officials - and governed by Sharia law. Scroll down for video . Suing: Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo (above) announced in an interview on Tuesday that the city would be suing FOX News . Host Sean Hannity was the first to make mention of this on his January 7 program, saying; 'It seems if you watch in recent years, it’s not just France but all of Europe, there’s been a major influx, immigration, people from Muslim countries. They’ve even - and they’ve not assimilated, they’ve separated.' He then added; 'They have no-go zones. If you’re non-Muslim, you’re not allowed. Not police, not even fire department if there’s a fire. Sharia courts have been allowed to be established. Prayer rugs in just about every hotel.' Just a few days later, Jeanine Pirro welcomed analyst Steve Emerson on her show, who said of these zones, believed by many to be entirely inaccurate from the start; 'They’re sort of amorphous, they’re not contiguous necessarily, but they’re sort of safe havens.' Emerson then took the idea a step further by stating; 'And they’re places where the governments, like France, Britain, Sweden, Germany — they don’t exercise any sovereignty so you basically have zones where Sharia courts are set up, where Muslim density is very intense, where police don’t go in.' Finally, Emerson wrapped the segment up by making the claim that Birmingham, England was an example of one of these zones, and that 'non-Muslims just simply don’t go in.' FOX News ultimately issued corrections for these statements, as well as an apology. Muslim myth: This in response to the network's claim that Europe was filled with 'no go zones' where non-Muslims were not allowed, which was first introduced by Sean Hannity (above) Too far: A guest of Jeanine Pirro's (above) show, Steve Emerson, even claimed that Birmingham, England was an example of a 'no go zone' That, however, is not enough for Mayor Hidalgo. 'When we're insulted, and when we've had an image, then I think we'll have to sue, I think we'll have to go to court, in order to have these words removed,' she told CNN's Amanpour. 'The image of Paris has been prejudiced, and the honor of Paris has been prejudiced.' Michael Clemente, the Executive Vice President of News at the network said in a statement; 'We empathize with the citizens of France as they go through a healing process and return to everyday life. However, we find the Mayor’s comments regarding a lawsuit misplaced.'","In her first international interview in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack, Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo announced the city would sue FOX News .

"Ukip's general election campaign descended into chaos this morning after internal party rows over policy spilled out into the open. The party's health spokesman Louise Bours publicly slapped down party leader Nigel Farage after he suggested the NHS may need to be privatised to cope with the growing pressure on the health budget caused by a rapidly-ageing population. It came after the Ukip MEP in charge of writing the party's 2015 manifesto was replaced – after not coming up with any policies. Scroll down for video . Tim Aker has been replaced as the Ukip policy chief after failing to complete the party's manifesto in time for May's crunch general election . Nigel Farage has admitted he would be forced to resign if Britain voted to stay in the European Union in a referendum. The Ukip leader said it would be 'curtains' for him and his colleagues if the country rejected the chance to cut ties with Brussels. David Cameron has promised a referendum on Britain's membership if the Conservatives form the next government. Mr Farage said: 'The loss of a referendum means curtains for Nigel and it means curtains for the current crowd here in head office.' It comes after Mr Farage last year vowed to resign as party leader if the party fails to achieve a general election breakthrough. He said: 'If we'd failed in the European elections I would have stood down, if we fail next year the party will pick someone better than me, but do you know what? That ain't going to happen.' Tim Aker was replaced as the Ukip policy chief after failing to complete the party's manifesto in time for May's crunch general election, senior party figures have confirmed. The revelation emerged after Mr Farage sparked controversy by claiming that privatising large parts of the NHS was 'a debate that we're all going to have to return to' if the health service was going to stay affordable. Within hours of the remarks Ukip's Health Spokesman, Louise Bours, insisted Mr Farage was out of touch with the public when it came to the NHS. She said: 'Nigel is entitled to his opinion and others are entitled to theirs, we don’t whip people into all thinking the same thing, like the establishment parties. 'As he has said before, he raised the idea for discussion a while ago, the party discussed at and rejected it. 'I am certain that if the party discuss it again, we will reject it again. The vast majority of Ukip members, the British public and I will always favour a state funded NHS.' The rows come just over three months before the general election in which Ukip is hoping to increase the number of MPs into double figures. But Mr Farage himself is facing a battle to be elected in Thanet South, where he is currently trailing the Conservative candidate Craig Mackinlay by up to five points in the polls. His election bid was also dealt a blow after stand-up comic Al Murray announced he would stand against Mr Farage as his TV character 'The Pub Landlord'. The revelation that Mr Aker – one of the party's bright young hopes – has failed to complete the party's manifesto in time in a fresh embarrassment for the party which has previously acknowledged that it needs to professionalise its operation. Nigel Farage is facing a battle to be elected in Thanet South, where he is currently trailing the Conservative candidate Craig Mackinlay by up to five points in the polls . According to the Times, Ukip had set the beginning of January as the deadline to agree its election policies. The manifesto would then be sent off to be checked and costed by an independent think-tank. Senior party figures had become increasingly concerned that Mr Aker, 29, was struggling to complete the final draft of the manifesto on time. A senior Ukip insider said: 'There was growing disquiet that none of us had seen hide nor hair on the policy front. It was especially annoying for candidates, who are banned from making any specific pledges before the manifesto is published. 'They don't know what to tell voters on the doorstep.' Ukip's deputy chairman Suzanne Evans has now been drafted in to finish the manifesto. She said: 'Tim Aker was responsible for running our policy programme, but as an MEP, borough councillor and PPC [prospective parliamentary candidate] for the target seat of Thurrock he stepped down from the role of policy chief. Comic Al Murray is standing against Nigel Farage is Thanet South . 'I relish the task of putting together the final details and presenting a sensible, radical and fully costed manifesto at our spring conference in Margate.' A Ukip spokesman this morning insisted it was untrue that Mr Aker had been 'sacked'. He said: 'It's bunkum. When he was elected as a borough councillor he said he couldn't do it any more. The handover was over the weekend of the ninth, tenth, eleventh of this month. 'The manifesto was always supposed to be ready for the conference next month.' Ukip has insisted its manifesto will commit to protecting the NHS as a free-to-use taxpayer-funded service. But Mr Farage has insisted that the idea of replacing the NHS with an insurance-based system is 'a debate that we're all going to have to return to'. He said: 'There is no question that healthcare provision is going to have to be very much greater... and we're going to have to find ways to do it.' Last year a video emerged from 2012 in which Mr Farage proposed an 'insurance-based system of healthcare'. He had been recorded saying: 'Frankly, I would feel more comfortable that my money would return value if I was able to do that through the marketplace of an insurance company than just us trustingly giving £100bn a year to central government and expecting them to organise the healthcare service from cradle to grave for us.' Mr Farage said: 'I triggered a debate within UKIP that was outright rejected by my colleagues, so I have to accept that. 'As time goes on, this is a debate that we're all going to have to return to.' But in his latest interview Mr Farage insisted that the way the NHS is run will have to change to care for Britain's ageing population. He said: 'There is no question that healthcare provision is going to have to be very much greater in ten years than it is today, with an ageing population, and we're going to have to find ways to do it.' Andy Burnham, Labour's Shadow Health Secretary, said Mr Farage's comments 'confirmed that a vote for Ukip is a vote for the privatisation of the NHS and for a full American healthcare system'. He said: 'Farage admits he says one thing in public about the NHS but another behind closed doors. He has shown UKIP's statements on protecting the NHS to be hollow. 'UKIP claim to stand up for working people, but in reality they are more Tory than the Tories. Farage will never be able to distance himself from his real views. He should be honest with the public.'","Ukip leader Nigel Farage raised prospect of privatising large parts of NHS .

"Two Pennsylvania brothers were charged with theft, conspiracy and receiving stolen property after allegedly stealing nearly $500,000 worth of sewer grates and selling them for scrap metal. Brian Vetrulli, 36, and John Vetrulli Jr, 38, of Gilbertsville, were arrested on Saturday in the King of Prussia section of Upper Merion Township in their white 2013 Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck. Police were alerted to the truck because it matched the description of a vehicle believed to be involved in the thefts of 13 iron sewer grates from parking lots in the area. John Vetrulli Jr. (left) and Brian Vetrulli (right) were jailed on Saturday in Montgomery County on charges of theft, conspiracy and receiving stolen property . After the vehicle was stopped, 'officers noticed a large pry bar [crowbar] in the bed of the truck', according to  police. The truck contained receipts from scrap metal dealers dating back to December 12, 2014, that indicated the brothers had sold off more than 1,000 grates for about $9 apiece. Investigators discovered the younger Vetrulli already had an outstanding warrant for theft  and when police questioned the brothers, they reportedly confessed to the 13 thefts in Upper Merion Township. The Vetrulli brothers reportedly confessed to taking 13 grates from Upper Merion Township in Pennsylvania . The Vetrullis also confessed to grabbing grates in Philadelphia, Limerick, Collegeville, Plymouth Meeting, Willow Grove, Abington, Bensalem, Haverford, Broomall, Upper Providence, and Montgomeryville. At this point, investigators believe the Vetrulli brothers 'caused approximately $500,000 worth of loss throughout five counties in approximately one month' as the iron grates cost nearly $475 to replace. They are being held at the Montgomery County Correctional Facility on $10,000 cash bail and a hearing has been scheduled for January 30.

"A father who took MDMA with his 17-year-old daughter has been jailed for five years for her manslaughter after he failed to take her to hospital when she was dying. Jason Wilkes had taken the drug with daughter Chloe at their home in Ashford, Kent, but when she became unwell took her to a wood and then to an industrial estate instead of seeking medical help. By the time the 45-year-old eventually called 999, Chloe was no longer breathing. Although doctors managed to restart her heart she died later that day. Scroll down for video . Jason Wilkes (left), who supplied his daughter Chloe, 17, (right) with MDMA and then failed to take her to hospital has been jailed for five years and four months after he admitted manslaughter . If Wilkes had sought medical help for her as soon as he realised she was unwell, hospital staff might have been able to stop her overheating, which caused her heart to stop, Maidstone Crown Court heard. Wilkes, from Ashford, had been due to stand trial over his daughter's death but today admitted Chloe's manslaughter by causing her to take a noxious substance and was jailed for five years and four months. He was told that although there was no suggestion that it was ever his intention to set about a course of conduct that would lead to Chloe's death there were features of gross negligence. Sentencing, Judge Philip Statman said: 'You will lead the rest of your life knowing that your conduct led to the death of your daughter who in my judgment you loved. 'That's an enormous burden for you to have to carry with you, but it is not just your burden. 'She is lost to her mother, brother and her extended family, a life tragically cut short.' The court was told Wilkes had already pleaded guilty to supplying her with MDMA at a previous hearing. He was given a 21-and-a-half-month term for supplying the drug to run concurrently to the manslaughter sentence. Wilkes and his daughter had taken drugs, including ecstasy and cocaine, together at least three times before but text messages between them showed it was a regular occurrence, James Mulholland QC, prosecuting, told the court. Wilkes, who could be seen crying in the dock as he was sentenced, would buy the drugs and split them between himself and his daughter, who was not employed or attending college at the time of her death, he said. When Chloe became unwell, her father Jason took her to a wooded area and then the industrial estate where he worked, instead of the William Harvey Hospital (pictured) where she later died . Mr Mulholland said: 'The prosecution case has always been that the actions of Jason Wilkes have played a significant part in her demise. 'Here was her parent who in reality should have been protecting her from Class A drugs and, in fact, encouraged his child to take them.' On the evening of July 25 last year, Wilkes and Chloe took a gram of cocaine and a gram of MDMA between them, staying up all night, the court heard. The following day, Wilkes bought another gram of MDMA and once his 13-year-old son, Chloe's brother, had gone to bed, father and daughter each wrapped half a gram of the drug up in a cigarette paper and swallowed it with water, 'a method of ingestion called bombing', the prosecutor said. By 1am on July 27, Chloe had started to become agitated and disorientated, Mr Mulholland said. In an attempt to cool her down, Wilkes first took her into the back garden of their home. He then loaded his barefoot daughter into the back of his car and drove her to a wooded area known as The Warren where she began talking nonsense and rambling, the court was told. But rather than taking her to the William Harvey Hospital in Ashford, which was less than three miles away, he drove her to RK Resource - a company which constructs scenery for stage and television - on the Henwood Industrial Estate where he worked and tried to use a fan to cool her down, Mr Mulholland said. He eventually called 999 at 2.01am, telling the operator his daughter was not breathing and that she did not have a pulse. Six medical staff battled to restart Chloe's heart and she was taken to hospital where staff fought for hours to save her but she died later that day, the court heard. A toxicology report showed that Chloe had 3.1mg of MDMA per litre in her blood, enough to prove fatal. Cocaine was also found in her blood, the court heard. Wilkes, who split up with Chloe's mother Elainor Wright, 38, when she was nine or ten, told police his daughter had been taking drugs, including MDMA and ketamine, since she was 13 years old, the court heard. He said he had told Chloe during the week that he felt 'like getting on it' and that she agreed so he spent about £160 on drugs over the weekend, Mr Mulholland said. Her friend Tiffany East told police that Chloe regularly used cannabis and speed but her drug use had become more prevalent and the level of drugs harder once they left school, the court heard. Mr Mulholland said Chloe and her brother had a difficult upbringing and had been living with their father for three years before she died. Wilkes drove his daughter to RK Resource - a company which constructs scenery for stage and television - on the Henwood Industrial Estate where he worked, and tried to use a fan to cool her down . He said Chloe had drug dealer contacts which her father would also use and text messages between the pair which related to drug usage were 'juvenile', 'light-hearted and enthusiastic'. Mr Mulholland said: 'If Chloe Wilkes had been rushed to hospital after she began feeling unwell, the medical staff would have been able to determine that she was overheating, and would have been able to stabilise her airway, breathing and circulation. 'They would have monitored her heart rate and would have been able to address those problems. 'That opportunity was denied to Chloe by the actions of her father. That failure played a subsequent part in her death.' He went on: 'It was a breakdown in parental responsibility, a breach in protective trust which should be inherent in such a relationship. 'This was not an isolated incident. This was repeated.' Referencing a statement from by Chloe's mother, Judge Statman said: 'The impact has been profound. 'One cannot think of anything worse for a mother to have to go through.' The court heard Wilkes had served a prison sentence in 1993 and had a conviction for possessing drugs in 1995. Judge Statman said: 'All parents fear a situation where their adolescent teenage boys and girls go to a party and engage in drug-taking. They may have suspicions something is wrong. 'That is one situation that will worry all right-thinking parents. The distinction here is there is a share of the drug father to daughter in the confines of the home where there is an ability to have control over what is going on. 'This is a very different state of affairs that this activity is encouraged, whether one is coming up to her 18th birthday or not.' Mr Mulholland replied: 'There is actual encouragement by father to daughter to take Class A drugs. There is a positive enthusiasm which is wholly different from a normal parental relationship.' The judge added: 'What concerns me is an individual who is well familiar with ecstasy and drug culture and knows well fine the symptoms of an overdose in regard to MDMA...what possible reason could there have been for taking the route he did having left home to the time when an ambulance was eventually called? 'She is unwell clearly at the home address. Why didn't he take her straight to hospital?' Mark Weekes, defending, said Wilkes would not necessarily have an appreciation of what would flow from the situation. Delivering his sentence, Judge Statman said: 'This case highlights the very grave dangers associated with the taking of the drug ecstasy. 'Chloe Wilkes - your daughter - was a healthy, active, 17-year-old with the rest of her life before her. 'She enjoyed experimenting like many others do. 'She enjoyed socialising with her friends and a good party. 'It is a council of perfection to seek to supervise a child at all times, particularly as they grow into adolescence. 'We cannot stop our children from doing things we do not want them to do but we can offer them appropriate examples and cornerstones in our behaviour. 'You bought ecstasy. 'You had the money to buy it. She did not. 'You supplied the drug to her. She was in your charge. 'You encouraged her to do what she did. 'There is nothing in your conduct that night which points to any form of discouragement given to her. Far from it. You encouraged her to do as she did, wanting to join in with her. 'It is something that would be understandable if you were two people out as adolescents but this is a massive responsibility that parenting brings with it. 'Further more you knew what the risks were for you were no stranger to this particular drug. You knew what the signs of overdose would be for all of those present who have swallowed ecstasy.' Speaking after today's hearing, Senior Investigating Officer Detective Inspector Richard Vickery of the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate said: 'This has been a tragic case for all those involved. A young life has been needlessly lost. 'Chloe's consumption of class A drugs was no doubt influenced and indeed encouraged by the defendant, her father, Jason Wilkes. His behaviour in this regard as a parent would seem incomprehensible. 'This case also highlights the acute dangers of taking any drug, and in particular class A drugs. I would encourage anyone involved in drug misuse to seek help. Meanwhile, Kent Police will continue to robustly pursue those that provide drugs within our communities.'","Jason Wilkes, 45, took the drug with teenage daughter Chloe at their home .

"Supporters of 'meninism', a controversial movement that opposes feminism, have now begun wearing 'meninist' T-shirts. The online retailer Teespring.com has sold 615 shirts bearing the hashtag #MENINIST at $22.99 each. 'Support the movement by getting yourself the official Meninist shirt. #YesAllMen,' proclaims the product description, seemingly mocking the #YesAllWomen hashtag that circulated social media to raise awareness for violence against women in response to misogynistic postings by Elliot Rodger before his deadly rampage in Isla Vista, California, last May. Controversial: The online retailer Teespring.com sells two shirts that show support for 'meninism', a movement that opposes feminism . Teespring has sold ten shirts in another style, which reads 'I'm A Meninist.', for $15 each. Its description says: 'Show your pride and tell the WORLD you're a MENINIST! The official t-shirt of #MeninistTwitter!!' The #Meninist Twitter hashtag began in 2013 as an outlet for men sharing jokes, according to the BBC, which noted: 'Supporters of the hashtag say it's become a channel for men to express the difficulties of being a man in the 21st Century.' A Meninist Twitter account, which now has more than 600,000 followers, posts misogynistic jokes. Proud: Men who've purchased the T-shirts have been sharing photos of themselves sporting them on social media . Not only men: A woman named Paige tweeted a picture of herself wearing one on Friday with the caption: 'Supporting equal rights @MeninistTweet #meninist' Last night, the account tweeted: 'Ladies, if you have more followers on Instagram than you do on Twitter it just means dudes like you better when you stfu [shut the f**k up].' Men who've purchased the controversial T-shirts have been proudly sharing photos of themselves sporting them on social media. One man, with the handle MeninistAmbassador, tweeted a picture of himself with the caption: 'Loving my new #meninist t shirt @MeninistTweet.' And it's not only men who are buying the shirts; a woman named Paige - who appears to support meninism - tweeted a picture of herself wearing one on Friday with the caption: 'Supporting equal rights @MeninistTweet #meninist.'

"Al Qaeda is using the leaks from US spy Edward Snowden to help its fighters evade Western surveillance technology, MailOnline can reveal. The terrorist group has issued new video guidance based on what they have learnt about Western spying methods from the Snowden disclosures which have been made public on the internet. The move confirms the worst fears of British and American intelligence chiefs who warned that Snowden's betrayal would play into the hands of the terrorists. The video even uses footage of news reports of the Snowden leak, highlighting how 'NSA is tracking millions of phones'. Scroll down for video . Guide: The seven and half minute video released by a media platform for Al Qaeda and other jihadist groups, provides detailed graphics on how terrorists can avoid detection . Snowden leak: Snowden revealed that the NSA and GCHQ was harvesting millions of emails, instant messaging contact lists and internet browsing history. Al Qaeda guidance: 'All your calls, messages and internet history are stored in this same place….spies have access to these files and can know your daily routine, friends and what you are planning to do tomorrow night at that tall building….’ Snowden leak: Showed Western agencies have the capacity to track and map the location of cell phones and was using cookies to 'piggyback' on the same tools used by internet advertisers 'to pinpoint targets for government hacking and to bolster surveillance.' Al Qaeda guidance: 'All mobile phone providers use the same software, your device continuously is in contact with the nearest tower……….As you are moving around your different coordinates are tracked and stored.' Snowden leak: The NSA's top-secret 'black budget', obtained from Snowden by The Washington Post, exposed the 'successes and failures' of the 16 spy agencies comprising the US intelligence community, and revealed that the NSA was paying private tech companies for 'clandestine access' to their communications networks. Al Qaeda guidance: The video warns Al Qaeda agents that spies are working with internet companies. Using a chart Al Qaeda even links Western countries, including the UK and the US, with named internet companies it claims they are working with. It comes after David Cameron travelled to America to urge Barack Oabama to put pressure on US Internet giants to co-operate more fully with intelligence and security agencies in the fight against terrorism. A seven and half minute video released by a media platform for Al Qaeda, and other jihadist groups, provides detailed graphics on how terrorists can avoid detection by what it calls the 'FBI Secret Spying technology' when using phones and computers. It identifies Western countries, including the UK, and the computer companies that it claims works with them. And, worryingly, Al Qaeda has published a list of software packages to protect against surveillance and where to find it on the internet. Spoken in Arabic but with English sub-titles it says: 'Allah created us with a unique voice, this can be used to track you anywhere no matter (sic) you buy a new phone, simcard or satellite.' It adds: 'We will now show you some different ways how the enemy can track you and have a view at some modern war technologies. 'All mobile phone providers use the same software, your device continuously is in contact with the nearest tower... As you are moving around your different coordinates are tracked and stored. All your calls, messages and internet history are stored in this same place… spies have access to these files and can know your daily routine, friends and what you are planning to do tomorrow night at that tall building…' 'Every Mujahed that does not take the right precautions can be a tool in the hand of the enemy. With his phone, tablet or laptop the enemy can listen/record all conversations and meetings. Adrian Culley, a former senior detective with the Metropolitan Police’s Computer Crime Unit, who has seen the video, said: 'It is clear the Snowden leaks have raised cyber security issues in the minds of terrorists. This video is concerned with techno fear and propaganda. 'We are in an cyber arms race with the terrorists and the security agencies have to be always one step ahead of the jihadists who only need to be lucky once to score a terrorist hit.' The video also exhorts people not to trust the 'kuffar' when using technology, reminding them: 'You have the power to let these spies know what YOU want them to know.' It also replays media reports of how Western agencies use a range of technology to pinpoint the location of millions of people. I spy: The video identifies Western countries, including the UK, and computer companies that it claims works with them . Fears: The heads of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ have all warned that Edward Snowden's exposé could educate a whole new generation of extremists . Al Qaeda warns its agents: 'Safe houses should in crowded cities and have different entries. Know your surroundings, keep your face down, the cameras are everywhere. Have a special place for Internet and phone use. If you are being monitored, they will do anything to catch you.' The heads of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ have all warned that Snowden's exposé could educate a whole new generation of extremists about how best to exploit the power of the web to peddle their militant ideology. And as far as Islamist terrorists fighting in Iraq and Syria are concerned, to have a 'Snowden-approved' security system on their mobile phones and personal computers is to possess the ultimate in internet accessories. During his work as a contractor at America's National Security Agency (NSA), Snowden gathered information about how it and its British equivalent, the GCHQ listening centre at Cheltenham, accessed social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook to monitor the activities of terrorists. New tech: The video even warns jihadists that fingerprints can be traced through their touchscreen phones to internet databases . Last week Jonathan Evans, who stood down as head of MI5 in April 2013, used his maiden speech in the House of Lords to deliver a devastating analysis of the harm caused by Snowden, who stole and leaked thousands of documents in June 2013 detailing intelligence-gathering techniques used by Western intelligence agencies. He now lives in an undisclosed location in Russia. The revelations have led to terrorists changing the way they communicate. They have also made internet companies less willing to co-operate with MI5 and GCHQ for fear of upsetting privacy campaigners.","Terror group issued tutorial video based on what they learned from Ed Snowden disclosures .

"The trial of a Saudi businessman accused in the 1998 Al-Qaeda bombings of US embassies in East Africa got underway in New York on Tuesday with jury selection. Khalid al-Fawwaz, who was allegedly head of al-Qaeda's London office until his arrest in 1999, is accused on four counts of conspiracy to kill Americans and conspiracy to destroy US property. The attacks on the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which were claimed by Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda network, killed 224 people and wounded around 5,000. Khalid al-Fawwaz was, among other things, head of al-Qaeda's London office until he was arrested in Britain in 1999. He has already spent 16 years in custody . The 52-year-old appeared in a Manhattan federal court on Tuesday to face terrorism charges . Arrested in Britain in 1999, Fawwaz has already spent 16 years in custody and pleads not guilty. On Tuesday, he took a seat in the Manhattan court room, just a short walk from the site of the former Twin Towers destroyed by Al-Qaeda in the 9/11 attacks. He wore a crisp white tunic, neatly pressed and of the type traditionally favored by men in Saudi Arabia, with a crocheted white prayer cap on his head. He had dark shadows under his eyes, his face was pale and partially obscured by a long, pointy grey beard. He folded his stocky frame into a court chair, put black-rimmed spectacles on his nose to consult documents and exchanged pleasantries with his lawyers. US prosecutors claim that Fawwaz was head of al-Qaeda's London office - put in charge personally by bin Laden, who was killed by US Navy SEALs in Pakistan in May 2011. Fawwaz is accused of setting up the London office to publicize bin Laden's statements and serve as a conduit for messages between different al-Qaeda cells . This August 1998 photo shows Kenyan residents looking at the US embassy (left) days after the bomb blast . From around 1993 - five years before the attacks - he was named as an al-Qaeda associate who allegedly began to establish businesses and residence in Kenya. From 1995 to 1998, he allegedly provided bin Laden and other al-Qaeda members with communications, including a satellite phone, and disseminated bin Laden's declaration of jihad in England. US District Judge Lewis Kaplan, who has overseen a string of terror trials ending in guilty convictions, opened the first stage of jury selection on Tuesday. A pool of around 200 prospective jurors, who have already completed questionnaires, will be whittled down to 12, with six alternates, who will hear the case. The process is expected to continue until at least Thursday before opening arguments can begin. The Fawwaz trial is estimated to last five weeks, considerably shorter than previously expected.

"Doctors believe a £20 test will save many lives by identifying damage to heart cells that they would otherwise have missed . A new £20 blood test doubles the chance of spotting hidden heart attacks in women. Doctors believe it will save many lives by identifying damage to heart cells that they would otherwise have missed. Existing checks are good at picking up cardiac trouble in men suffering chest pains, with a diagnosis rate of 19 per cent. However the rate for women is only 11 per cent. The new test, which is much more sensitive, produces a 22 per cent rate for both sexes. Patients whose heart attacks are not detected are more likely to have further - potentially fatal - episodes because they are not given the correct treatment. Developed by US firm Abbott, the test measures levels of troponin, a protein produced by damaged heart cells. It detects extra cases in women both because it is more sensitive and because doctors have lowered the threshold for a positive reading in females. Anoop Shah, a University of Edinburgh cardiologist who has studied the test, said: ‘While similar numbers of men and women attend A&E with chest pains, we wanted to know why women are less likely to be diagnosed with a heart attack. ‘Our findings suggest one reason for this difference in diagnosis rates for men and women is that we, as doctors, may have been using a threshold for troponin testing that is too high in women. Whether using different thresholds for men and women will lead to more accurate diagnosis and improve outcomes is now being evaluated in a large clinical trial funded by the British Heart Foundation.’ Dr Shah based his 22 per cent diagnostic rate on the cases of 1,000 men and women admitted to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh with chest pain. Peter Weissberg, the BHF’s medical director, said the new test took advantage of the fact that the danger level for troponin is lower in women than in men. The professor added: ‘This research has shown that the results of the commonly used troponin blood test are significant at different levels in men and women. 'When the researchers took this into account, they found that twice as many women would be diagnosed with a heart attack. Developed by US firm Abbott, the test measures levels of troponin, a protein produced by damaged heart cells (file picture) ‘If these results are confirmed in the much larger clinical trial we’re funding, they suggest that using a high-sensitivity troponin test, with a threshold specific to each gender, could save many more women’s lives by identifying them earlier to take steps to prevent them dying or having another, bigger heart attack.’ High-sensitivity testing was approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence last year but this is the first evidence of the value of gender-specific tests. The price of the standard and the high-sensitivity test is the same: £20. Diagnosis of a heart attack is usually based on symptoms backed up by tests. Patients with chest pain may be given an electrocardiogram as well as blood tests to assess damage to the heart muscle. Troponins, which are found inside heart cells, are released into the bloodstream when they become damaged by lack of blood supply to the heart. Every year around 110,000 men and 65,000 women in the UK are diagnosed with a heart attack . Three weeks ago, Jenni Stevens, from Edinburgh, collapsed at work with chest pain. The 41-year-old was rushed to the Royal Infirmary where she was diagnosed with a heart attack after being given the high-sensitive troponin blood test with the lower threshold for women. Jenni said: ‘I’d been having chest pains for about a month. As a working mum, I put it down to stress. But last week, as I was walking into work, the pain got much worse and I collapsed, causing my colleagues to call an ambulance. ‘I felt a sense of reassurance when I got to the hospital. They took my blood and did other tests. They thought I’d had a heart attack. 'I was treated with a stent to save my life. I’m so grateful that my heart attack was spotted and treated so well.’ Every year around 110,000 men and 65,000 women in the UK are diagnosed with a heart attack, and women are three times as likely to die from one than from breast cancer. The Edinburgh research was reported in the British Medical Journal.","Existing tests for cardiac trouble in women have diagnosis rate of only 11% .

"The NHS is ‘not fit for the future’ and unless it undergoes radical change it may be forced to abandon free healthcare for all, in the future, the service's top doctor has warned. Medical director of NHS England Professor Sir Bruce Keogh said the NHS must become far less reliant on hospitals and needed a ‘complete transformation’ of the way it operates. Sir Bruce told the Guardian: ‘If the NHS continues to function as it does now, it’s going to really struggle to cope because the model of delivery and service that we have at the moment is not fit for the future.’ GP surgeries need to be given more resources to cope with the pressures of demand and tight budgets, he added. Scroll down for video . Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, medical director of NHS England, warned the health service needs a complete 'transformation' if it is to continue providing free healthcare for all in the future. He said it needs to move away from a reliance on hospitals and that GPs must be given extra resources to cope with demand . In order for the NHS to keep itself sustainable, he said more services need to happen under the same roof – for example diagnostics tests and an expanded range of treatments at their GP surgery. Sir Bruce added: ‘If not, we will get to a place where the NHS becomes unaffordable and we will have to make some very difficult decisions which will get to the very heart of the principle of the NHS and its values. ‘This will open up a whole series of discussions about whether the NHS is fit for purpose, whether it’s affordable, and whether the compact with the citizen of free healthcare for all is sustainable in the longer term.’ He added: ‘Too many patients find the NHS fragmented (and) confusing. They find that they get pushed from pillar to post; they feel like a ball in a pinball machine at times.’ He denied claims that ambulance services, A&E and GP surgeries are struggling to cope and are in crisis – despite waiting times at A&E being at their worst levels in a decade. Three of the 10 ambulance trusts in England have had to declare a critical alert over the winter. But Sir Bruce denied it was a crisis. He said: ‘Everybody that’s working out there in the NHS knows that they’re under a lot of pressure at the moment. 'They don’t like the term ""crisis"" being applied willy-nilly. Britain's top doctor said despite the intense pressures on A&E departments and ambulance services across the UK, the NHS is not in crisis. He said: 'The word ""crisis"" implies that you can't deal with it' ‘It’s an evocative term which is also provocative and is used too freely for the wrong reasons. 'It’s a period of unprecedented pressure, of undue pressure. But the NHS is facing very difficult times, yes. The word ""crisis"" implies that you can’t deal with it.’ He added that the frontline services ‘are going through a critical phase’ but would recover. A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘In common with healthcare systems around the world, the NHS is facing unprecedented demand, but undermining the principle of services being free at the point of use is not the answer. 'Instead, we are backing the NHS’s plan for the future and have provided an extra £2bn in funding next year to transform out-of-hospital care and meet the needs of an ageing population.’","Sir Bruce Keogh, medical director of NHS England said the health service needs a 'complete transformation' to make it less reliant on hospitals .

"The  teen who stands accused of murdering her socialite mother in Indonesia and dumping her body in a suitcase has named her unborn child Stella, according to the baby's lawyer. Heather Mack, 19, is facing execution by firing squad in Bali, Indonesia, if found guilty of killing Sheila von Wiese-Mack, 62, whose body was found stuffed in a suitcase outside a luxury hotel last August. The inmate is currently seven months pregnant and is due to give birth on April 1 to a little girl - which already has its own lawyer - Vanessa Favia. Scroll down for video . Prison: Heather Mack, 19, is facing execution by firing squad in Bali, Indonesia, if found guilty of killing Sheila von Wiese-Mack, 62, whose body was found stuffed in a suitcase outside a luxury hotel last August . Suitcase: A policeman inspects the suitcase where the body of Sheila von Wiese-Mack, 62, was found inside at the police station in Nusa Dua on the Indonesian resort island of Bali . Favia said Mack is naming her baby Stella, after a family member. In another development in the high-profile case, a judge has ruled that the teen can have any lawyer she can afford. She allegedly wants to hire Ary Soenardi, the Bali lawyer rejected by Cook County Judge Neil H. Cohen last week as Mack sought cash from her $1.56 million trust fund to pay her legal bills. According to lawyers, Soenardi is known for representing 'a number of international drug smugglers, but has never before tried a murder case. Despite this, a judge ruled on Friday that Mack can use a $1.6 million trust fund left to her by her dead mom. On Thursday, a day after she made a preliminary court appearance to be charged with pre-meditated murder Mack sued her uncle William Wiese, to release money to pay for a defense lawyer. Young lovers: Heather Mack and Tommy Schaefer embrace in a prison cell in Bali in December, left, after they were briefly allowed to be together before being sent to separate prisons, she is pictured pregnant, right, . Benjamin Mackoff, the interim trustee of Mack's trust confirmed Soenardi was her preferred lawyer, according to The Chicago Sun Times. 'She is definitely within his control,' Mackoff told the newspaper. 'She refuses to have any other attorney than Ary Soenardi. And she will not accept any other attorney at this point.' Mack's new lawyer is expected to produce itemized bills from Soenardi but none of the money is allowed to pay for Schaefer's defense. Accused murderer: Tommy Schaefer, 21, listened in on proceedings sitting next to his translator at the court in Denpasar, Bali . Seven-months pregnant: Heather Mack, of Chicago, appeared emotional as she attended court in Bali, Indonesia, on Wednesday after being charged with the brutal murder of her mother Sheila von Wiese-Mack . Cohen said he has approved the payment of $150,000 in three weekly installments of $50,000 each from Mack's trust fund to Soenardi. Heather Mack and her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, 21, are accused of killing Mrs Wiese-Mack after her body was discovered in a suitcase placed in the trunk of a taxi. Mack and her mother arrived in Bali on August 4 and stayed in Kuta before moving to the St. Regis hotel in Nusa Dua, where they planned to stay until August 14. Schaefer had arrived on August 12 and stayed at the same hotel in a room booked by Mack under her mother's name. Prosecutors said that booking made Mack's mother angry and led to an argument in which Mrs von Wiese-Mack, who was white, scolded Schaefer, using a racial slur. Schaefer is black, as was Mack's father, James L. Mack, a highly-regarded jazz and classical composer who died in 2006. Schaefer is accused of battering her with the iron grip of a fruit bowl. Security camera video showed the victim earlier having an argument with Schaefer in the hotel lobby. The pair have been given separate trials on charges of premeditated murder, which carry a maximum sentence of the death penalty. Cohen said Mack was grateful for the judge's most recent decisions and added that she had the right to choose who she wanted to represent her.","Heather Mack, 19, is facing execution by firing squad in Indonesia if guilty .

"Officials investigating the victimisation of NHS whistleblowers have been deluged by comments from thousands of concerned staff. They were meant to publish their findings two months ago but have repeatedly had to push back the date because so many people have got in touch. The review is being overseen by the leading barrister Sir Robert Francis QC, who produced two reports into the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal. Officials investigating the victimisation of NHS whistleblowers have been deluged by comments from thousands of concerned staff - pictured is Professor Joseph Meirion Thomas who was put on two weeks’ gardening leave by the Royal Marsden Hospital in London after writing two critical articles about the NHS . So far, the review team has received 17,500 online responses and 600 by post – although some individuals may have got in touch more than once. Meanwhile, a critical report by MPs on the Health Select Committee warns that despite some improvements, many staff are still too scared to raise concerns and have been put off by the experiences of others. The report concludes: ‘The treatment of whistleblowers is a stain on the reputation of the NHS and has led to unwarranted, inexcusable pain for the courageous individuals affected.’ The Mail has long campaigned for the protection of whistleblowers and earlier this month revealed how a senior cancer doctor had been gagged by his hospital. Professor Joseph Meirion Thomas was put on two weeks’ gardening leave by the Royal Marsden Hospital in London after writing two critical articles about the NHS. The review into whistleblowing was ordered by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt last summer over concerns that many NHS staff were still too afraid to speak out. The review into whistleblowing was ordered by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt (pictured) over concerns that many NHS staff were still too afraid to speak out - officials have since been 'deluged' by comments from staff . Often those who implicate more senior colleagues when they raise concerns of poor care are bullied, disciplined or forced out of their job. Conservative MP Dr Sarah Wollaston, chairman of the Health Select Committee, said: ‘We’re not saying that everyone who raises concerns in the NHS suffers harm as a result. But there have been a number of high profile cases where that has happened. ‘There is evidence that for those professionals thinking of raising concerns, the fear of how that might impact on their career is still acting as a deterrent in coming forward. The system needs to continue to change.’ MPs also wants to make it easier for patients and families to complain by setting up a ‘one-stop’ helpline and website. Dr Kim Holt, a paediatrician who raised the alarm at the clinic which failed to spot abuse of Baby P, said: ‘The treatment of some staff has undermined patient safety, as there is a lack of trust in the system. ‘People have lost faith that they will be properly supported and protected – fear is pervasive.’ Two years ago Mr Hunt promised to make it easier for staff to raise concerns by launching a whistleblowing helpline and pledging to end gagging orders. These are payments made to employees to keep them quiet when they are dismissed from hospitals after speaking out. The review is overseen by the barrister who produced two reports into the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal . Last year the Mail highlighted the case of cardiologist Dr Raj Mattu, whose NHS trust had spent £10million trying to silence him after he warned of patients dying on overcrowded wards. He was suspended from Coventry’s Walgrave Hospital in 2000 and later sacked but finally vindicated in April when a judge ruled he had been unfairly treated. Yesterday Mr Hunt said: ‘We want to make the NHS the safest healthcare system in the world and we know that listening to patients and staff is absolutely vital to improve care.’ ÷A whistleblower paramedic who was banned from two hospitals after warning that patients were being treated in corridors has had the restriction lifted. Stuart Gardner was told by managers that he was ‘not welcome’ at either hospital after stating that conditions at Worcestershire Royal Hospital were the worst he had seen in 26 years. He told the BBC that at one point there were 18 patients queued up on trolleys. Yesterday Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, which runs the hospitals, the Royal in Worcester and Alexandra Hospital in Redditch, backed down. It said in a statement: ‘Unison and the Trust have agreed that the Trust does not have the authority to exclude an individual paramedic from its premises and the paramedic has received an apology for the suggestion that he should be excluded.’ Final embrace: Lisa Mpongwana, 27, and her husband Mthuthuzeli, 38,  after she made the decision to switch off his life-support machine - she claims he would still be alive if there had not been an ambulance delay . This harrowing picture shows the pain of a wife with her dying husband after he waited more than five hours for an ambulance. Lisa Mpongwana, 27, and her husband Mthuthuzeli, 38, are locked in a final embrace after she made the heart-breaking decision to switch off his life-support machine. He died from meningitis after falling unconscious in an ambulance which arrived at his home over five hours after his wife first called the emergency services. Mrs Mpongwana claims he would still be alive today without the delay. She said she first called 111 between 10.30pm and 11pm on January 5 after her husband began showing flu-like symptoms earlier that day. The operator was concerned and said a blue lights ambulance would be sent. However, nothing happened until 1.18am when a lone paramedic arrived in a car and then called for an ambulance. But the ambulance did not arrive until 4.30am, by which point Mr Mpongwana was fading and became unresponsive during the journey to the Bristol Royal Infirmary. Mrs Mpongwana spent the morning of January 7 in the arms of her husband before giving her consent for his life-support machine to be switched off. She decided to release the photograph – taken by a relative at the hospital – to raise awareness of meningitis. Mrs Mpongwana said: ‘People need to see the hurt I went through.’ South Western Ambulance Service has apologised for the hold-up blaming it on a ‘very busy time’.","Officials investigating victimisation of NHS whistleblowers have been deluged by comments from thousands of concerned staff .

"The requirements of a knowledge test which caused controversy after 99 percent of the participants failed have been amended, giving aspiring taxi drivers taking the exam four times as many chances to pass.

Equivalent driver knowledge tests exist in NSW for Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong. The exam contains components relating to geography and general knowledge. So far 17 existing taxi drivers in Melbourne have lost their licence for failing to achieve passable results on the exam. Describing the results earlier this month as 'very poor' Victorian Taxi Services Commissioner Graeme Samuel told the ABC the difficult and expectations of the test remain the same. So far the examination has a 99 per cent fail rate, with just six of 444 people who took the test passing . 'The test itself hasn't changed, nor has the standard we're requiring of the drivers - those standards remain the same,' Mr Samuel said. 'What we're doing though is giving the drivers four chances to sit the test and we're giving them some assistance in the training by producing a training manual.' Consisting of three modules, the examination takes in general and geographical knowledge, customer service skills and driver behaviour. Participants are required to answer 55 questions in an hour per module.

The changes in the exam were not an confirmation that the bar was set so high, Mr Samuel told the ABC, and the requirements of the test had not changed.

"The parents of a six-year-old boy who was dragged 160ft down a hallway by his teacher say they are shocked that she is back teaching. Ashley Silas, 30, was caught on surveillance camera pulling the first-grader across the floor at Brooks Elementary School in Bullitt County, Kentucky on October 29 last year. She was fired immediately but has since won an appeal over the decision. The district has assigned her to a long term substitute role at Bullitt Lick Middle School for $48,128 a year. 'I get a sick feeling in my stomach,' the boy's father told WAVE3 as he recalled the video. Scroll down for video . Caught on camera: Teacher Ashley Silas drags a six-year-old boy through the hallways at Brooks Elementary School in Kentucky in October for being disruptive. Silas has now returned to the classroom . Stubborn: At one point the teacher stops - but only to get a better grip on the first-grader's wrist . Shocking: The boy was dragged through the hallway in front of other children, the video shows . The man, who did not wish to be identified, pointed out that Silas dragged his son from the classroom and stopped at one point - but only to firm up her grip on the boy's arm. As she drags the boy along, she repeatedly looks at her cell phone, which is in her other hand. When Silas appealed her termination, she said she dragged the boy from the classroom because he was being disruptive and threatening another student and would not walk to the principal's office. Silas, herself a mother to a baby daughter, insisted that she was not hurting the boy and that the youngster actually enjoying being center of attention - which he denied when speaking to WAVE3. His parents added that he has ADHD but is unable to take medication because he suffers from side effects. They say they are working with the school to improve his behavior. 'Cruel': She continues dragging the boy to the elementary school's office - while checking her cell phone . When she was fired on November 7, Bullitt County Schools Superintendent Keith Davis said she had failed 'to take reasonable measures to protect the health, safety and well-being of students' or 'to refrain from subjecting students to embarrassment or disparagement'. After her appeal, the three-member tribunal concluded in December that although her conduct was 'shocking and offensive to virtually everyone', she did not deserve to lose her job. '(I)t does appear (the first-grader) was not harmed and did in fact enjoy sliding through the hall and being the center of attention,' the panel wrote. She was instead given a seven week suspension without pay and has returned to work. Eric Farris, the attorney for the district, said they had not wanted to hire her again but the tribunal appeals system left them no choice, WAVE reported.. Back at work: Silas, pictured with her daughter, has now started a job working for a nearby middle school . Anger: The boy's family, who did not wish to be identified, said they cannot believe a tribunal overturned the teacher's termination. Despite her claims, they say their son did not enjoy the experience . 'You're dragging a child 160 feet by his wrist, past his peers and other teachers and a parent, who is in the office,' Farris said. 'I mean in what world is that OK?' He said district officials have not yet decided if they will appeal the Silas case. An attorney for Silas said she accepted the tribunal's decision and was glad to be continuing her work for the school district. Hillview Police are conducting their own investigation and the county attorney will later decide if criminal charges should be brought against Silas.

We can reveal Hoda's boyfriend works for an investment firm in New York. He has been married once before and has a grown-up daughter. After visiting Hoda in New York on the Today show, Joel's daughter posted a message, calling her 'awesome'. Today, Hoda happily spoke out about Joel on the Today show, as she co-hosted the 10am hour with guest host Billy Bush. Saying it was the 'most incredible day ever...I can't believe my fortune day today', he joked: 'You have been outed by the Daily Mail!'. Hoda replied she had protected Joel for nearly two years, saying: 'You know when you're keeping something close to your chest', but said it was great to have her boyfriend 'out from the shadows'. As she showed off Daily Mail Online's story on air, she admitted: 'I have to say, I feel like some relief, you know when you're keeping a secret...I talked to him this morning and I was like, 'Who cares?' He said, 'Who cares?'"". Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy . Billy even teased Hoda about Joel's physique, calling him a 'handsome stud', and she replied: 'Can you believe!' Hoda, who was married to former tennis coach Burzis Kanga for two years until 2007, beamed with joy as she was spotted on vacation in Miami with Joel in December 2013  - and has now said she will not rule out marriage again. The couple have been seen out on the town in Manhattan, with Hoda taking her love as her guest to the 25th annual Chris Evert/Raymond James pro-celebrity tennis classic gala in November in Florida, where she was one of the celebrity players. They also joined Hoda's best friend Karen Swensen and her family at a Yankees game. And by New Year's Eve it was pretty clear the couple were out in the open as Joel joined Hoda at a celebratory dinner with her Today co-star Al Roker and his wife Deborah. The pair met by a twist of fate as Hoda told the Huffington Post in July: 'I almost didn't go out the night I met him. 'Cause you know how you don't feel like it because it's raining and icky and why not just watch a 'Law & Order' rerun and stay home and eat potato chips - and I'm so glad I went out that night because it was a chance meeting that ended up being kind of a life transforming event for me.'

Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy . The ""Today"" show host also opened up a little about what goes on in the bedroom with her 'wonderful guy', saying: 'For me, it is about connection. 'No one is into the sport of [sex]. You want to have a real deep, honest connection. For me, that is such a valuable part of who you are.' Despite having had to re-enter the dating pool after her divorce, which she said she found 'awkward and weird and freaky', Hoda added: 'I have found real life joy right as I'm knocking on the door of 50. He's a wonderful guy and I feel very blessed.' Speaking about her decision to keep their romance out of the public eye, Hoda told Wendy Williams in October: 'When you're dating and it's in public, sometimes your dating life gets accelerated because people are asking 'what's going on, is it great, are you getting married?' and suddenly the whole thing, it just explodes.' The couple that work out together, stay together: Hoda and Joel go for a run in East Hampton in July . When Wendy asked: 'Are you getting married?' Hoda replied: 'You know what, I didn't think I would want to get married again, I've been married once before, but yes!' She said Joel managed to woo her at an event with a 'bunch of Wall Street guys', where she was the speaker. Afterwards, he asked her to sign his copy of her book. Following her divorce, Hoda dated lawyer Jay Blumenkopf for a year before their split in December 2012.

"Whether it's snails and spiders or kangaroo meat, we have all tried foreign cuisine before - and not necessarily enjoyed it. Now a new video has captured the reactions of South Korean women as they eat some of the US's most popular junk food snacks for the first time. The guinea pigs are offered Goldfish crackers, salt and vinegar crisps, Poptarts, Cheez-its, Twizzlers, Rice Cripsy bars and War Heads Sour candy. Two South Korean women attempt to eat Poptarts, which leaves them completely flummoxe . The clip, posted on YouTube by Sw Yoon, sees the women's curious and horrified reactions to the contents of the food - including the amount of artificial flavours they contain. They are first presented with Goldfish cracker, with which they seem completely flummoxed. 'What is this?' asks one of the testers as the snack is presented to her. 'Gold fish marshmallow?' asks another. Many of the girls are reluctant to eat it, with one saying it looks like dog food and another adding that it is a baby snack or something an 'elementary teacher would give kids when they're good'. One of the women in the video looks amused as she breaks a piece off a Poptart . The salt and vinegar crisps were the least popular snacks because of their strong flavour . Despite their initial complaining, the women score the Goldfish crackers between three and nine stars, with one woman describing the taste as like their eating 'belly fat'. The strawberry-flavoured Poptarts cause even more confusion, with the majority of the women taking a long time to examine the jam-filled snack. One bewildered young woman repeatedly turns it over in her hand and says: 'It looks extremely obscure' while another tester takes a sniff of the pink-coloured breakfast item before quipping 'Ah the smell of artificiality.' One woman says the snack tastes 'like a toy' and another 'like a candle'. Although some of the participants eventually came round to some of the western flavours . The majority of the girls found Twizzlers very unpleasant and compared the texture to rubber . The chocolate Rice Crispies snack bars are a welcome relief from the two previous snacks. 'Finally something that's edible,' says one of the particularly unimpressed testers. 'Is there anyone who would hate this? It's pretty much a combination that's impossible to taste bad,' says another. The girls favourite snack was the chocolate Rice Cripies bars . Some of the girls came up with bizarre comparisons for the stateside snacks . The women are particularly suspicious of the salt and vinegar crisps. 'Wait. My nose isn't weird right?' says one of the women giving the potato chips a sniff before taking a bite: 'What why, what did they make this for? To eat it and spit it out?' 'What does it taste like?' the researcher asks her. 'Like as if someone's punching my tongue.' The extreme sour War Heads were easily the most unpopular of the snacks . Unsurprisingly she only awards the offensive snack one star out of ten before claiming that it is a waste of potatoes. To follow the salty snack the crew give their willing subjects a cherry Twizzler eat to try but even before they try the candy they are presented with problems. 'How do you cut this?' asks one adding 'For real do you cut it with your mouth?' But the women are equally unimpressed with the taste as well. 'Did I do something wrong to you?' asks one of the samplers after taking a bite from the candy. The extremely sour candy left the girls bewildered as to who would actually want to eat them . The rest of the women agree that the fruity smell is misleading and the snack is comparable to chewing on rubber with one adding: 'If I had a napkin I think I'd spit it out.' Next, the women taste the savoury Cheez-its - which they say would work well with alcohol. 'If they gave this as a side dish at bars and pubs I think people would keep eating it non stop,' one says. One woman opts to spit out the sweets as she finds them too sour to chew . 'Yeah I think it would be great with wine,' her friend agrees. To finish their tasting session the producers of the video are particularly cruel dishing out each participant with the infamously sour candy War Heads. The women are wary from the start. One cautiously sniffs it and asks, 'This isn't going to explode or anything right?' 'Do I just eat? I have a weird hunch about this. You're trying to kill us aren't you?' asks another. What follows is a series of pained expressions as each of the women's faces shrink in detest of the intense flavour. 'It's so sour,' one of them manages between splutters before threatening the crew 'I'm gonna kick your ass. What are you trying to do? I'll see you after this.' For several of the samplers the flavour is too much and they have to resort to spitting the small sweet out and one woman takes several gulps of water to recover. Unsurprisingly scores start at zero and raise to a four apart from one adventurous tester who gives it a seven before changing her answer to a seven point five.","Youtube vlogger gave seven South Korean girls seven US snacks to try .

"The Treasury has admitted they believe there are almost 50 million fake £1 coins in the nation's pockets. Experts now believe that almost one in every thirty pound coins is a fake with around half of these counterfeit coins good enough to fool vending machine and automated tills. In the last five years a total of nine million £1 coins have been detected and withdrawn by the Treasury. The Tresuary has admitted they believe there are almost 50 million fake £1 coins in the nation's pockets . However, the number of fake coins being spotted has dropped in the last year as the forgers have got better at producing realistic-looking replicas. Industry specialists say it costs around 20p per coin to make a fake £1 coin. The fakes are sold on the black market to distributors for around 70p each. The problem has become so bad in recent years that the Government has announced it is to introduce a replacement for the £1 coin which will be harder to forge. These are due to come into circulation in 2017. It has been designed by the Royal Mint and will be made of two different metals - like the £2 coin - and will be 12-sided. A Treasury spokesperson said: 'These attributes together would make it the most secure circulating coin in the world. A new £1 coin is due to be brought into circulation in 2017- and the Treasury believe it will be 'the most secure circulating coin in the world' 'One of the government's key economic objectives is to maintain confidence in the currency, and by introducing a new £1 coin with state of the art security features, the Government aims to safeguard the integrity of the coinage for the future.' It is estimated that it will cost industry a total of £100million to update all the automatic tills, parking meters and vending machines to cope with the new coins. While a genuine pound coin is made from a copper, zinc and nickel alloy, fakes are often produced using various metals to mimic the colour and composition. It may not always be easy to spot a counterfeit £1 coin without close inspection. The Royal Mint has produced this guide on how to spot a fake: . The date and design on the reverse do not match (the reverse design is changed each year) The lettering or inscription on the edge of the coin does not correspond to the right year . The milled edge is poorly defined and the lettering is uneven in depth, spacing or is poorly formed . The obverse and reverse designs are not as sharp or well defined . Where the coin should have been in circulation for some time, the colouring appears more shiny and golden and the coin shows no sign of age . The colour of the coin does not match genuine coins . The orientation of the obverse and reverse designs is not in line . Last year Dutch authorities said they had exposed an international smuggling ring which had shipped at least £30 million worth of fake coins to this country through sea ports. A year earlier, three British men were jailed for a total of 12 years after a 40ft shipping container filled with 1.6 million blank coins, along with £85,000 of good to go' coins in buckets were seized in a van after a police operation spanning three counties. Another 30,000 coins were discovered concealed in the fake floor of one of the gang's cars. In 2009 a plot to bring 500,000 fake pound coins to Britain from Italy was foiled by Italian police. Fake £1 coins have become harder to detect over the years as forgeries have improved. They can sometimes be spotted if the ribbed edge is poorly defined, or if the Queen’s head is indistinct. Sometimes the colour and weight can be slightly different. Another sign of a dud is a misalignment of the ‘head’ and ‘tail’. If a coin is held with the Queen’s head upright, when turned around, the tail’s pattern should also be upright. If it’s at an angle, the coin is fake. Since the introduction of the pound coin in 1983, the design on the other side from the Queen has changed every year in an attempt to stop fraud: this allows experts to compare the design with the year on the coin to see if they match. Last year also saw the Bank of England recover a total of £11.7million in counterfeit bank notes. There were 423,000 forged £20 notes, 246,000 fake £10notes and 15,000 dodgy £50 notes seized by the authorities.","Nine million fake £1 coins have been detected and withdrawn in five years .

"Canadian special forces clashed with Islamic State fighters in Iraq last week, in the first recorded firefight between Western troops and the Islamic militants. Soldiers visiting front-line positions with Kurdish Peshmerga forces came under heavy mortar and machine gun fire, Brigadier General Michael Rouleau confirmed. The Canadians used sniper fire to 'neutralise' the ISIS threat without taking any casualties. He said the troops, whose job it is to train the Iraqi military, fired back only in self-defence, adding: 'My troops had completed a planning session with senior Iraqi leaders several kilometres behind the front lines. Scroll down for video .

The general said that while Canadian soldiers are not participating in active combat, they do have the right to fire back in order to protect themselves. He told a group of reporters in Ottawa: 'This is the first time this has happened since our arrival and our reaction is wholly consistent with the inherent right of self-defense.' Rouleau, who is the commander of special operations, and other Canadian officials declined to say where the gunfight happened - citing operational security. For the first time, the general did admit that Canadian soldiers have been helping Kurdish forces by directing coalition air strikes from the ground. Canada has six CF-18 fighter jets, a refueling tanker aircraft and two surveillance planes in the region as part of an air combat mission that includes about 600 airmen and airwomen. The news emerged as Islamic State released a new video in which the group threatens to kill two Japanese hostages unless they receive $200 million within 72 hours. Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pledged $200million in non-military support for countries fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria only two days ago. The footage which appeared on various militant websites  featured the British-accented militant widely known as 'Jihadi John', who appeared in the beheading videos of four Western hostages last year. He identifies the men - kneeling in orange jumpsuits - as journalist Kenji Goto Jogo and military company operator, Haruna Yukawa. Ransom: A video purportedly from ISIS shows Japanese hostages Kenji Goto Jogo and Haruna Yukawa in orange jumpsuits with a British-accented jihadi demanding $200 million in exchange for their lives . In the firing line:Footage on Kenji Goto Jogo's last Twitter post in October shows him talking in front of the Syrian city of Kobani, which has been under siege from ISIS fighters for months . Kidnapped: Haruma Yukawa, a private military company operator in his early 40s, was kidnapped in Syria, but his reasons for going to the country remain unclear . The militant directly addresses Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, now on a six-day visit to the Middle East with more than 100 government officials and Japanese business leaders. Brandishing a knife and dressed all in black, the militant says: 'To the prime minister of Japan. Although you are more than 8,000 and 500km (5,280 miles) from the Islamic State, you willingly have volunteered to take part in this crusade. 'You have proudly donated $100 million to kill our women and children - to destroy the homes of the Muslims.' Canada is among dozens of countries that have joined the United States-led coalition fighting the Islamic State militant group in Iraq. It has 69 special forces soldiers in the country, in what the Canadian government has described as a training and advisory role. Rouleau said they do about 80 per cent of their training and advising well behind the front lines, and about 20 per cent right at the front lines.","Canadian soldiers came under heavy mortar and machine gun fire in Iraq .

"Catholics don't have to breed 'like rabbits' and should instead practice 'responsible parenting', Pope Francis has said. While firmly upholding church teaching banning contraception, Francis said there are plenty of church-approved ways to regulate births. But he said most importantly, no outside institution should impose its views on regulating family size, blasting what he called the 'ideological colonization' of the developing world. Scroll down for video . Pope Francis, pictured yesterday as he departed Villamor Airbase in Manila, says Catholics do not have to breed 'like rabbits' African bishops, in particular, have long complained about how progressive, Western ideas about birth control and gay rights are increasingly being imposed on the developing world by groups, institutions or individual nations, often as a condition for development aid. He said: 'Every people deserves to conserve its identity without being ideologically colonized.' The Pope's comments, taken together with his defense of the Catholic Church's ban on artificial contraception during the trip, signal that he is increasingly showing his more conservative bent, which has largely been ignored by public opinion or obscured by a media narrative that has tended to highlight his populist persona. On the trip, Francis gave his strongest defense yet of the 1968 encyclical Humanae Vitae, which enshrined the church's opposition to artificial birth control. He warned against 'insidious attacks' against the family — a reference to gay marriage proposals — echoing language often used by overwhelmingly conservative U.S. bishops. He insisted that 'openness to life is a condition of the sacrament of matrimony.' At the same time, however, he said it's not true that to be a good Catholic 'you have to be like rabbits.' He said 'responsible parenthood' requires that couples regulate the births of their children, as church teaching allows. He cited the case of a woman he met who was pregnant with her eighth child after seven Cesarean sections. Pope Francis waves to the crowds as he travels to the Manila airport in his Popemobile . Francis flew home yesterday after a week spent in Asia. Here he is pictured boarding his flight home . 'That is an irresponsibility!' he said. The woman might argue that she should trust in God. 'But God gives you methods to be responsible,' he said. He said there are many 'licit' ways of regulating births that are approved by the church, an apparent reference to the Natural Family Planning method of monitoring a woman's cycle to avoid intercourse when she is ovulating. During the Vatican's recent meeting on the family, African bishops denounced how aid groups and lending institutions often condition their assistance on a country's compliance with their ideals: allowing health care workers to distribute condoms, or withdrawing assistance if legislation discriminating against gays is passed. 'When imposed conditions come from imperial colonizers, they search to make people lose their own identity and make a sameness,' he said. 'This is ideological colonization.'","Pope Francis has said Catholics do not need to breed 'like rabbits'

"A chair held aloft, its legs already shattered from being hurled across the room, this image could easily come from the middle a riot or a particularly nasty bar fight. But this was the scene inside the Nepalese parliament yesterday after a session to decide the country's new constitution descended into chaos. Three parliamentarians - including Khadga Prasad Oli, leader of the ruling party - were injured during the scuffle, alongside three security staff who tried to intervene. Scroll down for video . Six people were injured - including the leader of Nepal's ruling party - after a fight broke out during a late-night session of the country's parliament yesterday . Leaders of the Maoist parties began throwing microphones and chairs during talks on the country's constitution. They are bitterly opposed to the current proposals, which they say will marginalise them . Fighting broke out after members of the minority Maoist party hurled furniture and microphones at the house speaker during a session in the capital Kathmandu. The punch-up began at the end of an all-night session of parliament aimed at drawing up a new constitution, which is due to be signed into law on Thursday. With the ruling coalition and opposition parties at loggerheads, the speaker proposed a vote on the constitution, as opposed to getting all 605 MPs to agree unanimously. That prompted leaders of the Maoist parties to hurl their microphones, followed shortly by their tables and chairs, in fierce opposition to the current proposals. The latest draft of the constitution has the backing of around two thirds of the country's MPs, meaning that it would likely pass any ballot. But Maoists fear that, as the legislation stands, it would marginalise their parties. They are calling for new provinces to be created which would give them greater power. Nepal has been trying to agree a new constitution since 2006 when the Maoists ended their armed rebellion. There have been six prime ministers and two elections since, but nothing has yet been agreed . The violence broke out after the speaker suggested a vote on the new constitution, which is backed by around two thirds of the 605 MPs. But Maoists argue that any legislation should be agreed by all . The anger spilled out on to the streets after parliament shut following the fighting, with the Maoist parties announcing a general strike to shut down schools, factories, and markets. Police in the Himalayan nation say they arrested 19 people for vandalising buses, trucks and cars as they tried to stop people from travelling to work. Images in Nepalese media showed piles of tires burning in the streets of the capital as demonstrators gathered, with the normally busy roads virtually empty. Nepal has been in a state of political crisis since 2006 when the Maoists ended their armed insurgency against the state, and agreed to join the country's parliament. Political leaders had set a deadline of Thursday for any new legislation to be agreed, but with parliament adjourned until later today, that seems unlikely . Since the fighting broke out the Maoists have called a general strike in the capital Kathmandu (pictured) shutting down schools, factories and markets . Since then Nepal has had two elections and six prime ministers, but nobody has been able to break the political deadlock and agree how the new state should be run. Officially the current batch of MPs have until 2018 to draw up a new constitution, but had hoped to push the legislation through sooner, as the uncertainty has been hurting Nepal's economy. Annual growth in the fledgling nation has dropped from 6.1 per cent in 2008 to 3.6 per cent in 2013, according to World Bank data.","MPs hurled microphones and chairs during fight in Nepal's parliament .

"Mexican prosecutors said Tuesday that DNA tests could not identify the charred remains that might be those of 42 missing college students. An Austrian forensics lab was unable to find any more DNA that could be used by conventional means to identify them, but said they have authorized a final, unconventional effort. The Attorney General's Office said the University of Innsbruck reported that 'excessive heat' damaged the mitochondrial DNA in fragments of teeth and bones, 'at least to the point that normal methods cannot be used to successfully analyze them.' Failure to positively identify the remains would be a setback for the government, which has struggled with widespread, often violent protests demanding that the students be returned alive, and with relatives' skepticism about the official belief they are dead. The shadow of a demonstrator is cast on a wall with graffiti protesting the disappearance of 43 rural college students, in front of the Mexican Attorney General's office, in Mexico City . The University had previously found DNA in the remains that belonged to one of the 43 students who were detained and disappeared in the southern state of Guerrero in September. Prosecutors say the students were turned over to a drug gang that killed them and then incinerated their bodies on a fuel-fed pyre, before crushing the charred remains and them in a river. Authorities sent only 16 sets of remains to Austria, saying the rest were so badly deteriorated there was no chance of identifying them. The university has offered to use one last technique to identify the remains, but says there is a risk the testing may destroy the samples without obtaining any useful information. That technique is known as massively parallel sequencing, which uses many computers in coordination to perform a task. The university said it expected the testing to take another three months, but could not give an exact date for results. 'The main risk is that the DNA extracted may be destroyed 'without yielding any usable results, prosecutors cited the university as saying. Demonstrators clash with police during a protest in demand of justice and clarification for the disappearance of 43 students from Ayotzinapa, in Chilpancingo, on Monday . Prosecutors said, however, they had authorized the new round of testing. Vidulfo Rosales, a lawyer representing families of the missing teachers college students, said prosecutors should have consulted the families of the missing students before making that decision. 'If these tests are done on the bone fragments, there could be practically nothing left,' Rosales told local media. 'This is going to have an impact on the parents' belief system. ... In rural tradition, mourning is highly symbolic, highly important.' The students went missing Sept. 26 after confrontations with police in the Guerrero state city of Iguala in which three students and three bystanders were killed. Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam has said they were attacked by police on orders of Iguala's then mayor, Jose Luis Abarca, who has since been detained after going into hiding. The police and Abarca allegedly had ties to the Guerreros Unidos drug gang. Police allegedly turned the students over to Guerreros Unidos gunmen, who took them to a local dump, killed them and stacked their bodies on a pyre and used diesel, wood and old tires to burn them. Authorities are holding more than 70 people in the case, which also forced the governor of Guerrero to resign.","An Austrian forensics lab was unable to find DNA that could be used to conventionally identity the remains due to heat damage .

"Not to his taste: Crystal, pictured above in Pasadena, where he made the comments, has now clarified his stance . Actor Billy Crystal has said he objects to all gratuitous sex on TV after a storm over comments in which he appeared to single out gay scenes for censure. Crystal, who became one of network television's first gay characters on comedy show Soap in the 1970s, said contemporary programs are 'pushing it a little too far' and need to take care not to 'shove it in our face'. But after his stance was widely criticized, he rowed back and said any depictions of sex which are 'gratuitous' are not to his taste. According to The Wrap, he had told an audience at the Television Critics Association press tour in Pasadena, California: 'Sometimes, it’s just pushing it a little too far for my taste and I’m not going to reveal to you which ones they are. 'I hope people don’t abuse it and shove it in our face… to the point where it feels like an every day kind of thing.' His comments were widely reported but, but on Monday night Crystal gave a statement to The Hollywood Reporter saying he had been misunderstood. He said: 'What I meant was that whenever sex or graphic nudity of any kind (gay or straight) is gratuitous to the plot or story it becomes a little too much for my taste'. In an interview immediately after his first, controversial statements, he also told a reporter perhaps he shouldn't have said anything at all. Scroll down for video . Remarks: Crystal expressed his opinion at a showbiz talk show audience. He is pictured above at the January 18 event . He declined to cite any examples of the too-explicit shows, but implied that intolerant attitudes he struggled with while playing Jodie Dallas from 1977 to 1981 have now swung the other way. In the appearance he also described how audiences were slow to accept openly gay moments in Soap while it was being aired on ABC - particularly when he was interacting with on-screen boyfriend Bob Seagren, who played Dennis Phillips. Explicit: Crystal also said that graphic heterosexual sex is too much for him. Pictured above is a scene from Girls showing Allison WIlliams during a sex act . Back in the day: Crystal, shown above in character as Jodie Dallas, one of network TV's first gay characters . He told the audience: 'It was very difficult at the time - Jodie was really the first recurring [gay] character on network television and it was a different time, it was 1977. 'So, yeah, it was awkward. It was tough.' 'I did it in front of a live audience and there were times when I would say to Bob, ""I love you,"" and the audience would laugh nervously. 'I wanted to stop the taping and go, ""What is your problem?""' However, Crystal later rowed back on his comments and said: 'Maybe I shouldn't have said anything today'. On-screen: This scene from ABC's Scandal is among those which has displayed intimate gay scenes . In a discussion reported in a blog on Xfinity, Crystal first blasted the today's culture of taking offense, then expressed his regret over speaking out at all. He said: 'We live in a very scary time in many ways. You can’t say this, you can’t say that, you can’t offend this group, that group. 'People come up to you and ask if you were offended. I don’t understand that. I understand it why everyone is watching out for the other person. That’s offensive to me.' He also said that his comments apply to heterosexual sex scenes as well as gay ones. He said: 'When it gets too far either visually…now, that world exists because it does for the hetero world, it exists, and I don’t want to see that either.' He and fellow star Josh Gad later referenced HBO's Girls as a show which features many graphic sex scenes.","Actor didn't say which shows offend him but said many are 'pushing it'

"Ed Balls today hit back at former Cabinet colleague Peter Mandelson over claims Labour wanted to 'clobber' the rich with new mansion taxes – but refused to say exactly how much people can expect to pay under the levy. The shadow chancellor said he 'promised' the tax on homes worth more than £2million would not be implemented in a 'crude' way and would raise £1.2billion a year for the NHS. He said people with homes worth between £2million and £3million would have to pay £250 a month - but he refused to reveal how much people would have to pay if they owned properties worth any more. The shadow chancellor Ed Balls said he 'promised' the tax on home worth more than £2million would not be implemented in a 'crude' way and would raise £1.2billion a year for the NHS . Mr Balls' remarks came after Labour grandee Lord Mandelson last night denounced the flagship policy - claiming it was 'short-termist'. The former business secretary said he preferred the Liberal Democrats' proposal to extend the council tax system with higher rates for more expensive properties, which he said would be better than 'just sort of clobbering people with a rather sort of crude short-term mansion tax.' But Mr Balls said that revamping council tax would be 'cumbersome and bureaucratic', and said that Labour's scheme in fact met Lord Mandelson's requirement for the levy to be banded. He sought to reassure those with properties worth just under £2million that this threshold will be regularly uprated in line with luxury house prices, and that HM Revenue and Customs will accept independent valuations obtained by home-owners to determine which side of the line their property falls. But he refused to set out in detail what those in home worth more than £3million could expect to pay. The shadow chancellor told BBC Radio 4's World at One: 'I promise you that it won't be crude. 'I don't want to clobber anyone, but I want to make sure that people who are paying too little tax because they are undertaxed in multi-million pound properties - and many of these are foreign owners who don't pay tax at all - pay their fair share to the NHS.' Lord Mandelson, one of the architects of New Labour, has described Labour leader Ed Miliband's plan to impose mansion tax as 'crude' Labour's proposed mansion tax is causing tensions within the party, with strong criticism from many including potential London Mayoral candidates Diane Abbott, Dame Tessa Jowell, David Lammy and Margaret Hodge. In an interview with BBC Newsnight last night, Lord Mandelson acknowledged: 'We don't have an efficient way of taxing property in Britain.' But he added: 'I don't happen to think the mansion tax is the right policy response to that, I think it's crude, I think it's short-termist, what we need is what I think the Liberal Democrats are proposing and that is the introduction of further bands that relate to different values of property within the council tax system, that's what I would like to see, it will take longer to introduce, that's true, but it will be more effective and efficient in the long term than just sort of clobbering people with a rather sort of crude short-term mansion tax.' Full details have yet to be announced, but Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls last year said homes worth between £2million and £3million will face an annual bill of £3,000, regardless of income. Critics warn the tax will disproportionately hit London and the South East, where many ordinary family homes will be caught by the plans. Labour estimates the tax will apply to fewer than 0.5 per cent of the homes in the country. People earning less than £42,000 will be able to defer paying the charge until their property changes hands in an effort to protect people, especially in the capital, who have seen the value of their house soar in recent years. Lord Mandelson said: 'You do need a fair, progressive taxation system where people who are earning the most and accumulating the most wealth pay the most. 'And for very many people they shouldn't pay anything at all, because they simply don't have the incomes, or the wealth, or the assets, to support that.' The former business secretary said he was not worried about the message being sent out by the mansion tax, but he added: 'I want policy effectiveness, I want efficiency. 'I think people are entitled to expect thought-through, sophisticated responses to serious problems.' He told Newsnight: 'We have to make sure that what we are doing is, in a sense, recreating the policies that we saw in the Clinton-Blair era, where we saw a pro-business, liberal economic approach but combined with very strong policies and interventions by government in order to create opportunities for individuals and to redistribute income and wealth more fairly.' In November, Ed Miliband (centre) was left humiliated after he was unceremoniously taken to task over the mansion tax proposal by singer and classical musician Myleene Klass (left) in a heated television debate . Conservative party chairman Grant Shapps said: 'With Mandelson joining the chorus of Labour voices opposed to Labour's homes tax, it is clearer than ever that Ed Miliband is a weak leader peddling a bad policy. 'It is yet more proof that he simply isn't up to the job of running the country.' The Liberal Democrat plan, backed by Lord Mandelson, would involve a series of extra bands of taxation for properties worth more than £2million on top of council tax. Earlier this month, Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy caused outrage from within the party after he set out plans to use millions of pounds raised from the tax in England to pay for 1,000 extra nurses north of the border. In November, Mr Miliband was left humiliated after he was unceremoniously taken to task over the proposal by Myleene Klass. The singer and classical musician tore strips out of his pledge during a television debate, telling him that it was 'disturbing'. 'You may as well just tax me on this glass of water,' she told him during the angry exchange. 'You can't just point at things and tax them.'","Lord Mandelson described mansion tax plan as 'crude' and 'short-termist'

"‘The thing about the Cayman Islands is that the best sights are underwater,’ said my taxi driver as he drove along the dusty road from the airport. ‘There’s just not a great deal above sea level.’ After a week exploring the trio of Grand Cayman, Cayman Brac and Little Cayman islands which make up the Cayman Islands, I had to disagree. While the Cayman Islands (the name comes from the word for crocodile, although they were originally named Las Tortugas by Christopher Columbus due to all the turtles he saw swimming there) lack the ‘bling’ factor of their Caribbean neighbours such as Barbados and St Lucia or the flamboyant night-life of Jamaica or Cuba, it is certainly not just a diving-only destination. The diving in the Cayman Islands is spectacular but there's plenty for non-divers to see too . With spectacular beaches plus luxury hotels, a vibrant restaurant scene including a ‘Flavour Tour’ on Grand Cayman where you can visit four or five different restaurants in a night, sampling the menu of each and the deliciously warm Caribbean climate, there is certainly more than enough to keep landlubbers happy. However diving is what the Cayman Islands are best known for and the main reason for my trip. As a complete novice at scuba-diving I had to start from scratch. Before I left the UK I spent two evenings submerged in a swimming pool in central London being taught the basics of scuba-diving, including how to get to grips with the breathing apparatus and ways of communicating underwater. The clear blue water and warm climate make Grand Cayman a perfect place for swimming and sailing . Between lessons, I completed the theory part of the course online, which covered the technical aspects such as the effects of depth and pressure, so my precious hours out in the Caribbean wouldn’t be spent in a classroom. Eight hours of late night studying later I had passed all the modules and was ready to go. The 11-hour flight included a refuelling stop in Nasser, Bahamas and I was soon being driven to my hotel, the Marriot Grand Cayman Beach Resort. Like other international hotel brands such as the next-door Ritz-Carlton - which does a very impressive breakfast - it was on the stretch of golden sand known as Seven Mile Beach on the western side of the island where hotel guests spend the daylight hours sunbathing, drinking and swimming in the clear blue sea. Seven Mile Beach on Grand Cayman runs along the western side of the island . Many of the hotels - built to cater for tourists and business travellers - are based on Seven Mile Beach . If you want more of a local atmosphere then just a short taxi ride away was the island’s capital George Town and many friendly restaurants where you could dine al fresco and watch the sun setting across the ocean. As a British Overseas Territory (and with an international financial centre too, due to its reputation as a tax haven) Grand Cayman is very well looked after: the beach is pristine, the roads are smooth and the whole island feels rather smart but unshowy. After my lessons I was now a PADI-qualified diver . However I soon swapped the opulence of the hotel resort for the more down-to-earth dive hostel at Cobalt Coast near the top of the island where I was going to try and get that all-important PADI open water qualification. My instructor Jane, who arrived sporting a pink rash vest, pink flippers and a pink mask, kitted me out with all the diving paraphernalia I needed: oxygen tank, buoyancy vest, weights and flippers and a mask. I was now time to put all that learning into action as I lumbered along the dock and clambered down a ladder to the open sea. This was better than a London swimming pool! The sea bed was a forest of waving plants and while the sensation of swimming underwater, the movement of the waves and the unexpected (to me) noise of breathing through a bubble-emitting mouthpiece did take some getting used to, it was an incredible experience, particularly spotting turtles, crabs and brightly-coloured fish in their natural habitat. After two dives with Jane, in which I showed I could do various tasks such as take my mask and breathing apparatus off underwater, and ascend quickly but safely if I needed to, I was awarded my PADI open water qualification which meant I could now go on dive trips. I made use of my brand new diving qualification straightaway to visit Stingray City, a slightly surreal experience which involved sitting on the ocean bed 10 feet underneath a boat while around 20 stingrays whirled around me. If you were brave you could feed them - I tried and discovered for myself the power of the stingray suck, enough to draw blood from my knuckle. Divers can stroke and even feed the massive stingrays at Stingray City - but be careful of their powerful suck . The waters around the Cayman Islands teem with wildlife which swims around the coral reefs . There was more diving planned for the smaller island of Little Cayman, but I had more to see on Grand Cayman first, so I headed off to the Botanic Park and the Blue Iguana recovery programme on the middle of the island. This was set up to save the native iguana from extinction (there were once just 12 of them). The hard work of its staff means that the blue iguana has been taken off the critical list but there is still much work to be done. While it was rather confusing to see the so-called 'blue' iguanas actually looking rather more grey then blue, once they were fed their favourite food, the strong-smelling noni fruit (think very stinky cheese) they were soon glowing blue with contentment. There was just enough time to fit in a night-time swim with luminescent sea creatures (and a couple of jellyfish, ouch) and a rather surreal visit to the 80-strong classic car collection of Norwegian shipping magnate Andreas Ugland where Ferraris mingled alongside Elton John’s Rolls-Royce and even the Batmobile from the 1950s TV series. The blue iguana is usually greeny-grey but turns bright blue with happiness once it has been fed . Midweek I caught the tiny 15-seated De Havilland plane for the 40 minute flight to Cayman Brac, which is just 12 miles by one. Popular with walkers, Cayman Brac has some spectacular views from its cliffs and is also known for its excellent diving. However it has just 2,000 inhabitants compared to around 52,000 people who live on Grand Cayman. Cayman Brac, the middle of the three islands, has just 2,000 inhabitants and is popular with hikers . However it looks positively crowded compared with Little Cayman, the smallest of the island group with a population of just over a hundred people (rather more iguanas) and my favourite by far. The airport is tiny: you literally step off the plane, pick up your bags and you are already on the main road. There is no security fence, no terminal and no baggage carousel. When you’re waiting for your flight out, you go and get a drink in the nearby Hungry Iguana bar and wait for a phone call from the airport to let you know that your flight is ready to take off. You finish your drink, walk out of the bar and straight onto the plane – simple! My home on Little Cayman was a luxury condominium called The Club . I stayed in The Club, a group of luxury condominiums overlooking the ocean next to the Little Cayman Beach Resort and had the whole place to myself. It was incredibly relaxing - I swam and made rum daiquiris by day and dined under the stars on the roof of the Southern Cross club just a short walk along the beach at night. One day I kayaked out to my very own desert island, 100 metres offshore, bringing books and a picnic and enjoying the clear blue skies, white sand and 40 degree sunshine, paddling back later to watch the football on the beach bar television while drinking the local beer called Caybrew. The Southern Club club has rooms on the beach and kayaks to take you to your very own desert island . With a population of just a hundred people, life on Little Cayman is anything but crowded . The Club had sturdy old bikes for me to travel around the tiny island - including cycling across the airport runway and trying not to squish the large crabs scuttling along - and I spent one memorable evening at the Pirates Point hotel run by local legend Gladys Howard, where the guests tried to outdo each other making outrageous cocktails from the free bar. However I had saved the best until last - diving on the Bloody Bay Wall, one of the top dive sites in the world with a 6,000 feet deep coral wall. Swimming over that and watching the earth plunge away beneath me was an incredible experience and for the first time I understood the lure of diving which gets people travelling the world to explore its depths - and I realised that my taxi driver was probably right.

"A US Customs and Border Protection helicopter stopped a boat believed to have been smuggling marijuana into the country by firing at a vessel that refused to yield. The Blackhawk fired the rare warning shots near Catalina Island, 22 miles southwest of Los Angeles, after the suspicious boat was spotted by the Coast Guard after 10pm on Saturday. The incident was the first time that shots had been fired at a boat from the air on the West Coast, Mitch Pribble, Director of Air Operations for CBP in San Diego, said. A US Customs and Border Protection helicopter has fired warning shots at a suspected drug smuggling boat off the California coast for the first time (file picture) A Coast Guard aircraft, two Border Patrol boats and the helicopter all followed the panga boat - a small fishing vessel about 22ft long - where crew could be seen throwing bales believed to be marijuana overboard. The boat refused to yield, but 'stopped immediately' after the Blackhawk shot across its bow around 11pm. US Customs and Border Protection said that protocol was followed to make sure the shots would not hurt the boating public. 'You always want a vessel to stop when they are first directed to do so. However, when a suspected criminal chooses to flee, the ability to fire those warning shots gives us another option,' Pribble said. Marine interceptor boats were used to catch up to the suspicious panga boat and arrest its crew, who were seen dumping bales believed to be marijuana overboard (file picture) Marijuana smuggling gives billions of dollars to violent drug trafficking organizations, largely based in Mexico . The patrol boats caught up to the suspicious vessel after it stopped and took the three men on board into custody. The agency also seized the panga boat and the Coast Guard helped look for the dumped goods. The boat's seizure is part of an ongoing struggle to stop drug trafficking from Mexico into the United States, a business that makes billions of dollars and has caused gang violence near the southern US border. Smugglers have used the waters near Catalina Island for their operations before. It is thought some smugglers transfer drugs from the panga boats to recreational vessels common at the popular sailing destination so that they can more easily ship the contraband onto the mainland. One ton of marijuana worth $1million was confiscated from smugglers in 2012 after seven people were arrested trying to move the drugs onto a small sailboat near Catalina. US border agents seized 23,335lb of marijuana at border crossings with Mexico in the fiscal year 2014. The illegal Mexican drug trade is thought to receive between $19billion and $29billion each year from US demand.","Fishing boat near Catalina Island had refused to stop .

"A pupil who describes himself as an ‘anti-conformist’ had to sit in isolation for more than two weeks at school because of his bleach-blonde Mohican hairstyle. Oscar Ward, 16, who has sported the style since Christmas, was pulled out of lessons at lunchtime on his first day back at King James’s School in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, and told to leave. The Year 11 pupil said he was eventually allowed to stay providing he worked in isolation, a silent removed area reserved for disruptive pupils - where he has even had to sit a GCSE exam. Mohican cut: Oscar Ward (pictured), 16, who has sported the style since Christmas, was pulled out of lessons at lunchtime on his first day back at King James’s School in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, and told to leave . Aerial: Staff at King James’s School in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, said Oscar 'deliberately broke the rules' Oscar said: ‘I’d had four lessons that day and no teachers said anything about my hair. A lunchtime supervisor asked if any staff had spoken to me about my hair and I said “no”. ‘She then went and got my Head of Year. I was originally told I had to go home - but then they said I could work in isolation. That was Tuesday lunchtime. I had to stay in there every school day since. ‘I’ve had a Mohican a while and just dyed it blond last week. I know the school has a policy but it’s really a bit vague. I’m an anti-conformist and I think we have a right to be individuals. ‘Mine is blond. A lot of girls bleach their hair - why is this any different? But then I’ve also been told different reasons why I am in isolation from different teachers. Isolation: Oscar claims to be an 'anti-conformist' but his headteacher insisted that school policy states 'hair, make-up and style should be kept conventional' Statement: The headteacher said no other school in the area would accept the haircut 'to my knowledge' ‘Some say it’s the colour, others say the style. I’m concerned that it’s now affecting my education. 'I’ve had to sit a GCSE exam in isolation and have been given work from lessons or told to copy out of textbooks.’ Oscar’s father Paul Ward, 50, said: ‘We think the rules are a quite vague about suitable hair styles. The thing that shocked us is the speed at which a decision was taken for him to go into isolation. ‘Oscar works really hard at school and putting him in isolation isn’t supporting his education.’ Robert Lamb, headteacher at King James’s School, said: ‘Our policy states very clearly in school diaries that hair, make-up and style should be kept conventional. It says “No unnatural colours, no hair shaved or cut into”. 'The children are well aware of this rule. This pupil turned up with his hair blonde and shaved when he knew it was against the rules. No other school in the area would accept it to my knowledge. This pupil deliberately broke the rules.’","Oscar Ward returned to school after Christmas break with new hairstyle .

"Victorino Chua, 49, from Stockport, is said to have poisoned 21 patients 'completely at random' by lacing drips with insulin . A male nurse murdered three patients by putting poison in saline drips and leaving them as ‘ticking timebombs’ for other medics to administer, a court heard yesterday. Victorino Chua is said to have poisoned 21 people ‘completely at random’ by lacing the drips with insulin then waiting for other nurses and doctors to unwittingly give them to patients. One of the survivors was left with a serious brain injury. Eventually, a pattern began to emerge and Chua, 49, was ‘the common denominator’ in all the cases, the court heard. Prosecutor Peter Wright QC said it was a ‘lottery’ which patients were harmed because the drips were unknowingly administered by others. ‘In the vast majority of cases, the poisoner seems to have contaminated products completely at random,’ he told the court. As the victims became critically ill, Chua is said to have covered up his ‘handiwork’ by falsely recording that they were fine. In one case, he claimed a victim was ‘comfortable’ when in reality he was close to death after being poisoned with insulin, a jury was told. Mr Wright said Chua’s motive was hard to determine with precision, adding that ‘only the person responsible could ever know why they would embark on such conduct’. He said the nurse had ‘turned from a man who had dedicated his life to caring for others, to harming them’. Filipino-born Chua faces 36 charges over an alleged poisoning campaign that spread panic through a busy NHS hospital between the summer of 2011 and January 2012. They include the murders of Tracey Arden, 44, Arnold Lancaster, 71, and Derek Weaver, 83, none of whom recovered after allegedly being poisoned with insulin. Chua is also accused of altering drug dosages, in one case putting an 86-year-old’s life at risk by changing her prescription chart after arguing with her daughter about her care. The jury heard he upped the amount of medication meant for Maria Pawlyszyn after her daughter demanded she be put on a heart monitor. The married father of two, who came to Britain in 2002, worked on two wards at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport. A number of its patients were found to have unexplained low blood sugar over a three-week period, his trial at Manchester Crown Court was told. Staff initially assumed a batch of saline used for administering medication and flushing out cannulas had accidentally become contaminated with insulin, the court heard. But police were called when it became clear a poisoner may have been at work. Tracey Arden, 44 and Arnold Lancaster, 71, died at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport in 2011. Chua is accused of their murders . Interviewed as a potential witness, Chua expressed concern that the room in which medication was stored was not kept locked, Mr Wright said. He added that the nurse’s shifts fitted the pattern of unexpected hypoglaecemic episodes suffered by 21 patients on wards A1 and A3 in June and July 2011. Prosecutors say 83-year-old Alfred Derek Weaver, who also died in 2011, was another of Chua's victims . The jury heard Chua recorded that Grant Misell, 41, was doing fine even though he was dangerously ill and had insulin in his blood. The patient was later found to have suffered ‘catastrophic’ brain damage. ‘If it wasn’t Victorino Chua who poisoned Grant Misell, who was it?’ asked Mr Wright. He said Chua had tampered with saline products before, leaving them ‘like a ticking timebomb’ for nurses on the next shift. Mr Wright said the incidents stopped after the hospital imposed tougher security measures that ‘restricted the opportunity for the poisoner’. Instead, he said, Chua took ‘a different approach’. In January 2012, nurses realised their prescription charts had been ‘crudely’ altered to increase the dosages or frequency. In one case, 5mg had been tripled to 15mg. In some cases, including Mrs Pawlyszyn’s, Mr Wright said the consequences could have been fatal. Fortunately, the ‘forgery’ was discovered before she was given the increased dose, and the only patient who did receive extra medication made a full recovery. Mr Wright said the idea that the insulin contamination and the prescription alterations were the work of two different poisoners was ‘so improbable as to be capable of being discounted’. ‘Mr Chua had the means and the knowhow,’ he told the jury . ‘He also had the opportunity. So, it may be said, had many others. We say... the conclusion you are driven to reach is that the person responsible for each of these matters is the defendant.’ Chua had been working at Stepping Hill since 2009 when the deaths occurred. The court was told it was 'a lottery' which patients were harmed by the contaminated bags . He told the jury of 10 men and two women: 'The pieces of the forensic jigsaw began to emerge. 'The person responsible for each of these matters became increasingly clear. It was, we say, Victorino Chua. 'As the investigation intensified, the common denominator, the defendant, was shown in sharper and sharper relief. Insulin is produced naturally by the body to regulate blood sugar levels, and various forms are widely available in hospitals for treating patients, including those with diabetes, the jury was told. But minuscule amounts deliberately used to contaminate medication, or products such as saline used in drips and other procedures, can prove fatal, prosecutor Peter Wright QC, told the jury. In an otherwise healthy patient, it causes levels of glucose in the blood to drop sharply within a matter of minutes. Symptoms include a pale, sweaty appearance, but prompt treatment with sugars usually results in a full recovery. However, if it is not detected in time, patients suffer convulsions and eventually slip into a coma, potentially resulting in brain damage and ultimately death. 'Motive for this course of conduct, whomsoever is responsible, is difficult to determine with precision. 'Only the person responsible could ever know why they would embark on such conduct.' Chua was arrested on January 5 2012 and denied any wrongdoing. The nurse, who is married with two children, was born in the Philippines and left school at the age of 17, before graduating with a nursing degree in Manila in 1989, where he worked in the 1990s. In February 2002 he came to the UK on a temporary two-year work permit, working in nursing homes. He became a registered nurse in 2003 and a naturalised UK citizen in 2008. In 2009 he began working as a staff nurse at Stepping Hill. Chua, from Stockport, has pleaded not guilty to 36 charges in all, including the three alleged murders. The other charges are made up of, one count of grievous bodily harm with intent, 23 counts of attempted grievous bodily harm, eight counts of attempting to cause a poison to be administered and one count of administering a poison. All of the offences are said to have happened between June 2011 and January 2012. The trial continues. Panic gripped Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport as staff came to suspect a poisoner was leaving ‘ticking timebombs’ on the wards, the jury was told.

"Ellar Coltrane is the movie critics' new darling. Acclaimed for his breakthrough starring role in the Golden Globe-winning Boyhood, the 20-year-old with his pouty lips, occasional nose ring and diffident air heats up red carpets wherever he goes. Already he has been named Best Young Actor at the Critics' Choice Awards and is nominated by the Screen Actors Guild along with his onscreen parents Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette and sister Lorelei Linklater for best ensemble cast. 'Boyhood' is considered one of the leading contenders for Best Movie at next month's Oscars. But Coltrane's Hollywood high life is all a world away from the rusting 50-year-old school bus that his maternal grandmother calls home. Scroll down for video . Hippie grandma: The grandmother of Boyhood star Ellar Coltrane,  Kathy Horton,  lives a world away from Hollywood in a decades old school bus with her five dogs, two cats and 17 chickens . The reel deal: Ellar Coltrane in a scene from Boyhood with 'reel' mom Oscar nominated Patricia Arquette . Real mom: One-year-old Ellar with his mother Genevieve Kinney in Austin, Texas in 2003. Genevieve, 49, has been married and divorced three times - just as  Patricia Arquette was in Boyhood . Real dad: Bruce Salmon - his mother's second husband - is a musician like Ethan Hawke in the film . Kathy Horton lives in the bus alone, except for her five dogs, two cats and 17 chickens all of which have free rein over the living quarters and the two mattresses slung in the back. The aging hippie pays $125 a month to park it on a small plot at the end of a dead-end road in Elgin, 20 miles east of Austin, Texas. Horton, 69, rarely speaks to members of her family, and admits she hasn't had contact with Ellar in three years. But, in an exclusive interview with Daily Mail Online she says she has heard he is 'happy, happy, happy' with his new-found fame. Ellar's much-heralded performance spans 12 years . She remembers the early years of the movie, which took 12 years to make. 'Ellar would go away for a couple of weeks and come back with a lot of money — I think it was around $1,500 each time. That doesn't sound much now but for a young boy it was a lot and his mother let him buy whatever he wanted.' Four years ago the budding star moved in with her. 'I had a house on Jessie Street in Austin. I was looking after my uncle before he had to go into a rest home. We had a garage down below and Ellar wanted to make it his apartment. He was only 16 at the time. 'But it rained and he got flooded out.' When asked if she misses her family, Horton launches into a rambling explanation involving Adam and Eve and the people on their perimeter, which carries a basic message that once a man is grown he should leave his family behind. Horton has seen Boyhood, but unlike her favorite movie Titanic with Leonardo DiCaprio which she says she watched for 14 days straight, she only saw it once. 'I can't get the DVD to work now,' she said. Simple life: A vegetarian, Kathy mainly lives on eggs from her chickens and what she can grow. 'I eat sprouts,' she explains. 'I've got radish and alfalfa and, and…that other kind.' She says the only thing she misses about her old life is kissing . Tragedy: Breaking into tears, Kathy explains that her beloved black Labrador Abigail crawled into her SUV unknown to her. She shut the door and didn't realize until too late that the two-year-old dog was inside. Abigail died of heat exhaustion . She said there are parts of her grandson's life woven into the story. Just like Arquette's character, Ellar's mother Genevieve Kinney, 49, Kathy's daughter, has been married and divorced three times. In the movie, two of those marriages break down when the husband turns to drink. 'That didn't happen in Genevieve's life,' says Horton. 'There was no heavy drinking there.' Genevieve's first husband Patrick McGarrigle was several years older than her. She met him because he had initially been seeing Kathy. 'We didn't date, we were hippies. Hippies don't date,' said Horton. 'My problem was I never told Patrick I loved him. Perhaps he'll read this and realize I did.' Her second husband, Bruce Salmon is Ellar's father. Like Ethan Hawke in the movie, he is a musician. Ellar — born Ellar Coltrane Kinney Salmon — decided against using his family names professionally as, he said, it was 'too personal.' Genevieve's third marriage to landscaper Russell Womack ended two years ago. The family has been told by moviemakers IFC Films not to speak to the media without permission, Womack told DailyMail.com. But that message apparently didn't get to Kathy Horton in her isolated school bus in Elgin. She hasn't left her patch of land in 14 months, despite owning a decade-old Isuzu Trooper. Breaking into tears, she explains that her beloved black Labrador Abigail crawled into the SUV unknown to her. She shut the door and didn't realize until too late that the 2-year-old dog was inside. Abigail died of heat exhaustion. Ellar and his mother's first husband, Patrick McGarrigle,  taken at the wedding of the actor's uncle's in 2010. The young actor currently lives in Austin with Patrick, according to Kathy, who was in a relationship with McGarrigle before her daughter and regrets not telling him she loved him . Ethan Hawke is a loving but absent dad to Ellar's character Mason in the movie . 'How could I go back inside that car now?' she asks. 'I do need to go to the dentist for some work on my teeth,' said Horton. 'But I can't get there.' Now she has a new black Lab, which she also calls Abigail. That dog had three puppies on New Year's Eve which are now beginning to crawl over her bed. A tan Chihuahua called Pookie also shares the bus. Horton was wearing a frayed and ripped blue dress which ended a good six inches above the knee. She walked through her garden barefoot with her long 'golden ochre' hair cascading over her shoulders. 'Please report that my hair is golden ochre,' she urged. She got the term from 'Angelsea,' a song by her favorite artist, Cat Stevens. 'Don't you agree that I have golden ochre hair?' A neighbor who works at Walmart brings back groceries, she said. Others who live nearby aren't so accepting of her eccentric life. 'One guy is trying to get me to leave. He shoots up in the air with his 20-gauge about eight times a day. I hear the pellets landing on the roof of the bus.' Almost on cue we hear a boom and seconds later shotgun pellets rain down around us. 'I called the cops on him first time he did it, but they said there's nothing they could do. But it's real pesky.' Horton wants to have her old bus towed to land she says she once owned four miles away on Texas Route 973. 'I think I'll get it back in four years time,' she said. 'I bought it in 1973 and it's on Route 973, so getting it back when I'm 73 makes sense. 'There's no water here. My land had a beautiful pond with trees and water plants. You could hear the fairies. But I'm one-sixteenth American Indian and a hippy and I thought I didn't need property — another bad decision!' Kathy points out a  photo of her son Genesis hanging inside the 60's-era school bus . Grandpa: Kathy quit her job as secretary to the Dean of Arts and Sciences at the University of Texas when she was in her mid-20s, she said. Then she walked out on her husband, Girard Kinney, a successful architect whose work is dotted throughout Austin, taking Ellar's mom, then aged six, with her . Winners! Ellar Coltrane poses with  Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette and director Richard Linklater at the 20th Annual Critics' Choice Movie Awards at the Hollywood Palladium . Still, Horton has no regrets about the life she chose. She threw up her job as secretary to the Dean of Arts and Sciences at the University of Texas when she was in her mid-20s, she said. Then she walked out on her husband, Girard Kinney, a successful architect whose work is dotted throughout Austin, taking Genevieve, then aged six, with her. She and Kinney left the Texas capital to work in Crystal City, Texas, a border town that was roiled when it elected an all-Mexican-American city council in the early 1960s. 'That's where I became a hippie,' she said. 'My husband took me there, but he also lost me there.' She remarried and had two more children, but that marriage ended too. Horton bought the bus for $500. She fell in love with the solid cedar roof a previous owner had installed. Now, more than 40 years later the cedar's aroma still fills the vehicle. Her yard is littered with empty gallon milk containers and corn kernels pecked bare by the hens. She has a washer-dryer combination in a lean-to shed and a large refrigerator stands outside the bus. Pride of place is an old horse trough, in which, Horton says, she gave birth to the youngest of her three children, Leamarie in 1985. 'It was a water birth. We heated the water up to 105 degrees and put a lot of salt in it.' A vegetarian, she mainly lives on eggs from her chickens and what she can grow. 'I eat sprouts,' she explains. 'I've got radish and alfalfa and, and…that other kind.' She says the only thing she misses about her old life is kissing. 'Why can't men kiss anymore? Not the open mouth, tongue in throat kind, but with the lips. My husband had the most wonderful lips, just like Ellar's. 'Oh, and bathtubs. I really miss soaking in a bathtub. I have a shower here, but it's not the same.'","Kathy Horton, Boyhood star Ellar Coltrane's maternal grandmother, hasn't seen him in three years but he is 'happy, happy' with his new-found fame .

"Scientists have succeeded in reading parts of an ancient scroll that was buried and blacked when Mount Vesuvius erupted almost 2,000 years ago. The scroll was one of hundreds that form the world's oldest surviving library - and researchers say they are now hopeful it could reveal  all of its secrets. It was retrieved from the remains of a lavish villa at Herculaneum, which along with Pompeii was one of several Roman towns that were destroyed when Mt. Vesuvius erupted in A.D. 79. Scroll down for video . A close up of the Herculaneum Papyrus scroll. Scientists have succeeded in reading parts of an ancient scroll that was buried in a volcanic eruption almost 2,000 years ago, holding out the promise that the world¿s oldest surviving library may one day reveal all of its secrets. Some of the texts from what is called the Villa of the Papyri have been deciphered since they were discovered in the 1750s. But many more remain a mystery to science because they were so badly damaged that unrolling the papyrus they were written on would have destroyed them completely. 'The papyri were completely covered in blazing-hot volcanic material,' said Vito Mocella, a theoretical scientist at the Institute of Microelectronics and Microsystems (CNR) in Naples who led the latest project. Mocella and his colleagues decided to try a method called X-ray phase contrast tomography that had previously been used to examine fossils without damaging them. Phase contrast tomography takes advantage of subtle differences in the way radiation — such as X-rays — passes through different substances, in this case papyrus and ink. Using lab time at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, France, the researchers found they were able to decipher several letters, proving that the method could be used to read what's hidden inside the scrolls. Previous attempts to peer inside the scrolls failed to yield any readable texts because the ink used in ancient times was made from a mixture of charcoal and gum. This makes it indistinguishable from the burned papyrus.

'Our goal was to show that the technique is sensitive to the writing,' said Mocella. In a further step, the scientists compared the handwriting to that of other texts, allowing them to conclude that it was likely the work of Philodemus, a poet and Epicurean philosopher who died about a century before the volcanic eruption. The next challenge will be to automate the laborious process of scanning the charred lumps of papyrus and deciphering the texts inside them, so that some 700 further scrolls stored in Naples can be read, Mocella said. Two words in a hidden layer of the fragment. In the top the sequence of Greek capital letters spells PIPTOIE (pi-iota-pi-tau- omicron-iota-epsilon); in the bottom the letter sequence of the next line, EIPOI (epsilon-iota-pi-omicron-iota) Previous attempts to peer inside the scrolls failed to yield any readable texts because the ink used in ancient times was made from a mixture of charcoal and gum. Scholars studying the Herculaneum texts say the new technique, which was detailed in an article published in the journal Nature Communications, may well mark a breakthrough for their efforts to unlock the ancient philosophical ideas hidden from view for almost two millennia. 'It's a philosophical library of Epicurean texts from a time when this philosophy influenced the most important classical Latin authors, such as Virgil, Horace and Cicero,' said Juergen Hammerstaedt, a professor of Greek and Latin at the University of Cologne, Germany, who was not involved in the project. 'There needs to be much work before one can virtually unroll carbonized papyrus because one will have to develop a digital method that will allow us to follow the layers,' he said. 'But in the 260 years of Herculaneum papyrology it is certainly a remarkable year.'","Scroll among hundreds that form world's oldest surviving library .

"A 95-year-old world War II veteran died after being Tasered and hit with bean bag rounds by police for threatening care home staff - but his family insist he was killed unnecessarily. Police say that John Wrana, who lived in a Chicago assisting living home, was brandishing his cane, a metal shoehorn and a knife before officers shocked him and hit him with bean bag rounds. The senior citizen had been reported to authorities because he was being 'involuntarily' committed for medical treatment by staff at the Victory Centre, the Chicago Tribune reported. John Wrana (pictured with his wife, Helen) died after being Tasered and shot with bean bag rounds . He was behaving in 'combative' manner, by threatening staff with his cane and a shoehorn. Wrana was . reportedly scheduled to undergo a risky surgery, and was apparently . afraid to end up on life support. When . police arrived at Park Forest at around 8.45pm, they said he was . ordered to surrender, but he refused to and continued to berate staff . and threaten them. Officers . claim he then picked up a 6-inch knife, but his family's attorney . alleges that care home staff did not see him do this, The Blaze . reported. He was then shocked by a Taser, hit with rounds of bean bag ammunition, and was taken into custody and then to hospital. Staff claimed that he was sitting in a . chair during the row, suggesting that the force used by authorities . might not have been warranted, according to The Blaze. The . Chicago Tribune reported that Mr Wrana was conscious when he was taken . to St. James Hospital and Health Centers in Chicago Heights. But he was then moved to Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, where he died at about 2.30am. The . Southtown Star reported that an autopsy found the war veteran died from . being shot in the stomach with the 12-gauge shotgun with bean-bag ammo. The senior citizen had been reported to authorities because he was being 'involuntarily' committed for medical treatment . The incident was ruled as a homicide by the medical examiner, The Blaze reported. According . to the Wrana family lawyer, Nicholas Grapsas, the 95-year-old was . honorably discharged from the U.S. Air Corps in the rank of a sergeant . after fighting in India and Burma. During his service in the Pacific, he . was shot down once. After the war, the Massachusetts native moved to California and got into real estate before settling in Glenwood, Illinois. john Wrana died death was later ruled as a homicide by the medical examiner . His wife of more than 30 years, Helen, passed away in 2005. The veteran lived with his 74-year-old stepdaughter, Sharon Mangerson, until his health took a turn for the worse. An autopsy found that the 95-year-old man died from internal bleeding after being shot in the stomach from a bean-bag gun. Grapsas and Wrana’s stepdaughter have questioned the official version of events laid out by police, insisting that the elderly man was sitting in his chair the entire time, and neither his family nor staff ever saw a butcher knife in his room. ‘The Japanese military couldn’t get him at the age he was touchable, in a uniform in the war,’ Grapsas told the Tribune. ‘It took 70 years later for the Park Forest police to do the job.’ Grapsas said he was told that between five and seven responding officers came armed with a riot shield commonly used in demonstrations to enter Wrana’s room before shooting him in the stomach. His stepdaughter described the 95-year-old as a fiercely independent and vital man who still enjoyed playing cards. According to the Chicago Tribune, Wrana was scheduled to undergo an operation. On the night of the tragic incident, his doctor told Margenson over the phone that even if he survives the surgery, her stepfather will likely end up on life support. Wrana than got on the phone with Sharon, thanked her for everything she has done for him and told her he loved her before saying goodbye and hanging up. That was the last she's heard of him. Mr Wrana's family are now deciding whether to file a lawsuit, according to their attorney. 'This was a literal war hero,' Mr Grapas said. 'It’s outright insulting when you have such lack of respect for someone who served our country to the extent he did.' The Victory Centre is a 112-apartment supportive living community for adults 65 and older, it's website says.","John Wrana was being 'involuntarily' committed for medical treatment .

"More than 100 editors have written to the Prime Minister to protest against controversial laws which allow the police to spy on journalists’ confidential sources, including whistle-blowers. Campaigners first demanded changes to the rules when it emerged police had secretly launched snooping missions to get the phone records of two journalists investigating alleged wrongdoing by MPs. They said police should be forced to at least apply to judges before using the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act against reporters. Proposals unveiled by Home Secretary Theresa May (pictured) still allow forces to continue to authorise their own applications for journalists’ telecoms data under RIPA . Ministers insisted they had listened to the concerns and would take action. But the proposals unveiled by Home Secretary Theresa May still allow forces to continue to authorise their own applications for journalists’ telecoms data under RIPA. Officers must simply give ‘special consideration to necessity and proportionality’ if the application is made for the phone data of a medical doctor, lawyer, reporter, MP or religious minister. Now the editors of every national newspaper, and scores of regional papers and websites, are backing a letter co-ordinated by Press Gazette and the Society of Editors which warns the rules provide ‘wholly inadequate protection for journalists’ sources’. Campaigners first demanded changes to the rules when it emerged police had secretly launched snooping missions to get the phone records of two journalists investigating alleged wrongdoing by MPs (file picture) The letter states: ‘The mere fact a public official has contacted a newspaper is highly privileged information. ‘That an individual has contacted a lawyer or doctor tells us little. But the fact they have contacted a journalist identifies them as a source and exposes them to recrimination. ‘Public sector whistle-blowers will not come forward to journalists in future if law enforcement agencies have the power to view journalists’ phone records at will.’ Bob Satchwell, of the Society of Editors said: ‘Politicians say that terrorism laws should be used where relevant and proportionate. The police have used RIPA when it was neither. Journalism is not terrorism nor criminal.’","Editors protest over laws allowing police to spy on journalists' confidential sources .

"New York mayor Bill de Blasio has laid a wreath at the site of the Paris kosher store terror attack and vowed to stand in solidarity with France against 'terrorism and anti-semitism'. The mayor today visited the Hyper Cacher supermarket - alongside members of the local Jewish community -  as part of a brief overnight visit to the French capital. Hostages Yohan Cohen, Yoav Hattab, Francois-Michel Saada and Phillipe Braham were murdered at the kosher bakery by gunman Amedy Coulibaly, who was subsequently shot dead by police  on January 9.

His trip also includes a meeting with Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo, a wreath-laying at the Charlie Hebdo offices, and a visit to the spot where police officer Ahmed Merbat was shot and killed. The visit by the mayor comes just days after US Secretary of State John Kerry's belated trip to France in the wake of the terror sieges.

"Britain's most expensive one-bedroom flat has gone on the market for £10million. The luxury flat at One Hyde Park has been dubbed the ultimate 'pied-a-terre' and is so expensive that a simple waste bin takes up £6,300 worth of space. But there will be no room for guests at the property, which is regarded as the finest one-bedroom home in the world's priciest apartment block. The lower level of the duplex apartment is the sleeping area and boasts a huge double bedroom with en-suite bathroom. Upstairs is for socialising, with the area dominated by an open-plan living and dining room. There is also a separate toilet. Scroll down for video . It may have only one-bedroom, but the £10million apartment for sale at One Hyde Park boasts this huge living room with a large flat-screen TV . The lower level of the flat is a large bedroom, which has a large window looking out on the area around Hyde Park in central London . The one-bedroom apartment, in Knightsbridge, has now been put on the market for £9.9 million - 56 times the average house price in England and Wales. It works out at £6,300 per square foot and is £4.3 million more than the next most expensive one-bedroom property in the capital. And while large properties have sold for this £ per sq/ft price before, figures from LonRes, which tracks the property market, has a top one-bedroom price of £5,035 per sq/ft. The kitchen, which measures a modest 12'11 x 8'10, takes up around £700,000 of space - the same amount as a large family home in most cities. Whoever buys the flat will have to hand over £1.1 million in stamp duty. They also have to pay £2,000 per year in ground rent along with a £32,000 annual service charge. One Hyde Park was designed by Richard Rogers at Rogers, Stirk, Harbour and Partners. It opened in 2009 and is made up of 86 apartments with the interior designed by Candy and Candy. Residents get 24-hour SAS-trained security, an in-house maid service, same day laundry and dry cleaning, room service from the Mandarin hotel and a private temperature controlled wine store. The  huge price tag of the property - which is down the road from Buckingham Palace - means it works out at £6,300 per square foot . As well as a large bedroom, living room and kitchen, the two-storey exclusive apartment also includes a separate bathroom . The development also has 'unmatched leisure and entertainment facilities' which includes a private spa, 21-metre swimming pool, sauna, steam room, squash court and cinema. Simon Barnes, an independent property consultant, has been inside One Hyde Park and deals in the super-prime market. He said: 'It is an amazing place and it is not like buying a one-bedroom flat. It is a very modern, high quality build, you have the Mandarin next door and the ultimate concierge. 'The sort of person who will look at it is likely to be the sort of person who spends a lot of time in a hotel. But for £10 million you could get quite a few nights in the finest hotel suite. 'The bar in residential development keeps being raised. What you lack in London are the locations to build on, which is why they can charge such a price at One Hyde Park. 'Will the quality of developments improve? Yes, but it is highly unlikely you find a better location.' Residents also get the use of a swimming pool, room service from a neighbouring hotel, sauna, squash court and cinema in the building . The apartment block - which is guarded by an SAS-trained security team - has seen a previous penthouse suite sell for £140million . Meet the neighbours: Owners of other apartments in the building are believed to include (left to right) property developer Christian Candy, the former Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim al-Thani and the richest man in  Ukraine, Rinat Akhmetov . A number of homes like this are bought by people to show off, according to Henry Pryor, a buying agent. He said: 'They see these sort of homes as they do an expensive watch or a supercar. For them, the value with the bragging rights to their friends or impressionable girlfriend is often much more than the price.' The duplex apartment is on the market with Strutt & Parker's Knightsbridge office and also benefits from an underground parking space. James Gilbert-Green, a partner at the estate agency, said: 'One Hyde Park is commonly regarded as the best new residential building in London, if not the world.' The most expensive apartment to sell in One Hyde Park was a penthouse, which was bought for £140 million last year. Plans show the limited size of the apartment - but property experts say the 'bragging rights' of owning a flat in the building will attract the rich . While £10million only buys you a one-bedroom flat in central London's most exclusive apartment block, the same amount can buy you considerably more elsewhere in the world. A 300-acre estate, which includes three miles of beautiful Caribbean coastline, recently went up for sale on the island of Tobago. Luxury real estate firm Debutesq Group said the site offers the perfect opportunity for investors because authorities have granted planning permission for a leisure resort on an area known as the L’Anse Fourmi Estate on the island’s northeast coastline. A 300-acre estate which included three miles of unspoilt Caribbean coastline recently went on the market, also priced at £10million . Meanwhile in the UK, the same amount could buy you 47 houses in Manchester - where the average property price is £211,000. Four Scottish castles - boasting a combined 40 bedrooms and acres of land including coastline - are on the market each for less than £2million - meaning a buyer could purchase all four and still get change from £10million. In 2013, an entire Devon village, Bantham, consisting of 25 homes, a pub and a shop was put on the market valued at £10million. The estate which included the village was later sold for £11million and the owner allowed residents of the village to continue living in their homes. A nine-bedroom regency house in Worcestershire with 19 acres, was recently valued at just over £9.5million and Conkwell Grang, a ten-bedroom country estate near Bath with 278 acres is worth just over £8million. For those who don't want to get tied down to a mortgage, £10million could buy 7,279 nights - 20 years - staying in the Piccadilly Suite at London's The Ritz hotel, with breakfast. The same amount could by you 47 homes - practically a whole street - in Manchester, where the average property is valued at £211,000 .","One-bedroom apartment is spread over two floors of central London's most exclusive block of flats .

"A father-of-two has won a $75,000 lawsuit against New York City claiming he was choked and unable to breathe during a 2013 encounter with police. Attorney Jeffrey Rothman said yesterday that the settlement for Brooklyn man Kevin Dennis-Palmer was 'another example of a black man choked and beaten down into the ground.' He was approached by police officers while trying to parallel park his car outside his home on February 9, 2013. Kevin Dennis-Palmer was approached by police officers while trying to parallel park his car outside his home . He was then pepper-sprayed, lifted by his neck and slammed to the ground, according to his lawsuit. Charges brought against him alleging his windows were illegally tinted and he resisted providing driving credentials were later dropped . Mr Rothman said: 'He was trying to get his licence and registration, but he is a very large man and he was cramped in the car so he struggled to get out his licence,' Sky News reported. 'By the time he got his licence out, the sergeant lost his patience, pepper-sprayed him and they tried to drag him out of the car through the window. 'Then one of the officers slammed him to the ground and they tried to pick him up using a chokehold.' The lawsuit was filed in May before the death of Eric Garner last summer, whose treatment by police and a grand jury decision not to indict any officers prompted nationwide protests. Mr Garner, an asthma sufferer, died after a New York police officer placed him in an apparent chokehold during an arrest in July for selling loose cigarettes. A widely seen video showed him gasping: 'I can't breathe,' as he was wrestled to the ground in Staten Island by police. Mr Rothman said the circumstances in Mr Dennis-Palmer's case were similar to those of the Garner case. A federal judge approved the settlement last week. New York City Law Department spokesman Nick Paolucci said that 'based on an evaluation of the case, it was determined that the settlement was in the best interests of the city.' According to the lawsuit, he was ordered out of the car but could not immediately get out because of his large frame. It was alleged that officers tried to pull him by his collar through a window and pepper sprayed him and slammed him to the street when he emerged from the car with his hands up. Eric Garner died when he was arrested by NYPD officers, who put him in a chokehold. Officers have pointed out that Garner's size and health issues contributed . One of several officers who arrived at the scene lifted him up by his neck, choking him, as other officers struck him on the head and back, according to the lawsuit. Mr Dennis-Palmer, suffering from asthma, allegedly had difficulty breathing and screamed. 'I'm yelling, 'I can't breathe — you're choking me!' Mr Dennis-Palmer told the New York Daily News. According to the lawsuit, charges were brought against Mr Dennis-Palmer alleging that his car was stopped because his windows were illegally tinted and that he resisted turning over driving credentials. Mr Rothman said the charges were later dropped, and Mr Dennis-Palmer was treated for a swollen eye and cuts to his wrist and head. Mr Paolucci did not immediately respond Monday evening to an email seeking comment on Rothman's characterization of the case.","New York City has settled a lawsuit following chokehold arrest in 2013 .

"A womenswear brand which offers a wider variety of larger sizes targeted at the 'average' woman has reported an impressive boost in sales  after it rebranded in order to drop the plus size label from its official name. Hey Gorgeous, a New York-based online retailer which sells a range of larger labels for women, was formerly known Madison Plus Select before undergoing an official name change in May last year, after its founder, Aimee Cheshire, noticed how successful plus size model Robyn Lawley's swimwear range had become - because the size 8 to 18 designs were targeted at 'average' women rather than plus size customers specifically. 'We did find that a lot of women, especially [those who are] sizes 14 [or] 16, do not identify themselves as plus-sized, so they are just living life as they are and they can fit into some clothes, or can't,' she told Fashionista. Thinking outside the box: Aimee Cheshire (pictured), founder of online retailer Hey Gorgeous, chose to rebrand her company, dropping the 'plus' from its former name in order to target women of all shapes and sizes . 'We also found that customers do not necessarily want the term 'plus' in the name of the brand because then it will be calling them out to what they are and not everyone has embraced their size.' Mrs Cheshire added that many women don't want to feel as though they are browsing specifically for plus size labels and find it easier to share clothing recommendations with one another when they don't have to categorize them so specifically by size. Her insight into the minds of her customers is certainly paying off. Since rebranding, the company has seen a big boost in the number of women flocking to its site, with Mrs Cheshire explaining that many of those women who would normally avoid 'plus size' retailers and brands, feeling more comfortable about browsing through the site. Interestingly, the site has also seen big increase in the number of customers who appear to be recommending the retailer to their friends and neighbors, proving Mrs Cheshire's theory that people feel more comfortable sharing clothing options when they aren't labeled so obviously. 'I've seen orders [from people living] on the same street which is neat, because this woman must have told that woman,' she added. And Mrs Cheshire is not the only one embracing the idea of abandoning the 'plus size' label altogether. In recent months there has been a huge increase in the number of brands opting to extend their regular size ranges in order to include a wider variety of options, rather than branching out and creating a separate line targeted specifically at larger customers. Inspiration: Plus size model Robyn Lawley's eponymous swimwear collection isn't specifically aimed at plus size women, but rather at the 'average' customer . Substance over size: Miss Lawley, 25, is a size 12, which is considered plus size by the fashion industry . When Fashion Police co-host Kelly Osbourne announced the launch of her 13-piece fashion line for online retailer HSN, she insisted that it be available in sizes 0 to 24 in order to ensure it was marketable to all women, no matter what their shape. 'Because I have been everything from a size 0 to pretty much almost a 16, depending on the brand, it made me realize all the tricks I had learned to cover up certain areas or to detract from certain areas, and what I like in clothing,' she told WWD.com. 'It’s really unfair that America has this disillusion that the most common size is size 14, and that’s only because that’s as big as most fashion designers go.' Similarly, Target recently announced that it would be including a range of larger sizes in its upcoming collaboration with American fashion house Lilly Pulitzer, saying in a statement: 'It’s really important for us that we can provide stylish apparel for everybody, and we felt like this collection was the right time to do it. 'This project is so democratic. When we do these collaborations, there’s a certain group of people that always really respond to them. 'But this, anybody can wear this. There’s just such a range that anyone can find something that they love.'","Founder Aimee Cheshire changed the name of her company from Madison Plus Select to Hey Gorgeous .
She saw how successful size 12 model Robyn Lawley's swimwear brand was because it targeted 'average' women instead of plus size ."
"The US government recently revealed its investigations into 12,000 encounters with UFOs spanning between 1947-1969. Microfilms of these cases, collectively known as Project Blue Book, have become available for anyone to view online. Now some of the strangest from the collection have been highlighted, revealing the mysterious objects in the sky that left UFO hunters baffled. Scroll down for video . The Lubbock Lights incident was reported August 30, 1951 in Texas. The USAF said that these lights were most likely caused by birds named plovers, whose white breasts could reflect lights from the city below . One of the most famous is the Lubbock Lights incident, which was reported on August 30, 1951 in Texas by three professors, according to a report by Joe Tonelli onDigg. The witnesses were sitting in the backyard of one of the professor's homes when they saw 20 to 30 'lights' fly overhead. One of the professors said the objects 'appeared to be about the size of a dinner plate and they were greenish-blue, slightly fluorescent in colour. 'They were smaller than the full moon at the horizon. There were about a dozen to fifteen of these lights...they were absolutely circular...it gave all of us...an extremely eerie feeling.' This image, titled simply 'Winter 1951', was taken in New Zealand. While the photographer believed this to be a flying saucer, the USAF concluded that it was in fact a lenticular cloud. The lens-shaped formations are the result of moist air that has condensed at a high altitude . Kenneth Arnold  saw nine UFOs over Mount Rainier, on 24 June 1947 and the US government agencies took an interest in reports. A similar sighting (pictured) occured over Tulsa, Oklahoma on July 12, 1947 . This image was taken on April 15, 1965 in Omaha, Nebraska. There are no additional case files with this photograph. The USAF says that the Blue Book included 12,618 sightings reports, with 701 of which remained 'unidentified' Project Blue Book was the name for a project that investigated UFO reports between 1947 and 1969. It was the third study of its kind. The first two were projects Sign (1947) and Grudge (1949). The aim was to determine if UFOs were a threat to national security, and to scientifically analyse UFO-related data. The USAF says that Blue Book included 12,618 sightings reports, with 701 of which remained 'unidentified' – or around 5.5 per cent of the files. A termination order was given for the study in December 1969, and all activity under its project ended in January 1970. The USAF concluded that these lights were most likely caused by birds named plovers, which have white breasts that can reflect lights from cities below. Another image, titled simply 'Winter 1951', shows what the photographer believed to be a flying saucer. However, scientists discovered that the eerie shape was a lenticular cloud which are created by moist air that has condensed at a high altitude. The clouds are formed when the air temperature drops and moisture droplets are pushed up a steep slope by high winds. A more straightforward case can be seen in images of a UFO taken in Santa Ana, California on August 3, 1965 by highway worker Rex Heflin. Distant objects are hazy in the images because of the LA smog, while the UFO is not. Some suggest this is because the UFO is in fact a small object that was close to the camera. The USAF says that the Blue Book included 12,618 sightings reports, with 701 of which remained 'unidentified' – or around 5.5 per cent of the files. The files, which can be accessed here, were previously only available by visiting the National Archives in Washington. 'There is plenty of work for amateur investigators to try to come up with explanations they never had time to consider or research,' Nigel Watson author of the UFO investigations Manual told MailOnline. One case that Mr Watson is particularly intrigued in for historical reasons is a report filed by Kenneth Arnold which led to the popular term 'flying saucers'. This image was taken in Roswell in 1949. It is similar to a number of other images submitted, and has no case file associated with it . Found on July, 1957 in Ohio, the mysterious rock was thought to be from an alien civilisation. Experts initially said it was a meteorite that was over a century old. But after testing, they changed their minds and claimed it was a displaced piece of sediment from a glacier . No case files are associated with this image, which looks like a flying submarine. It was taken on December 27, 1954 in Bronx, New York. Mr Arnold saw nine UFOs over Mount Rainier, on 24 June 1947 and the US government agencies took an interest in reports. A similar sighting occurred over Tulsa, Oklahoma, just a month later on July 12, 1947 . 'They flew in a diagonal formation that stretched about five miles from the first to last craft, and they bobbed about erratically,' said Mr Watson. 'He estimated that they travelled faster than 1,000 miles per hour as they flew from Mount Rainier to Mount Adams.' When describing the sight to newspaper reporters, Mr Arnold said it was 'like a saucer would if you skipped it across the water.' This, said Mr Watson, reveals that the term flying saucer came from the description of the movement of the craft rather than their appearance. 'Explanations from mirages, secret aircraft to the flight of pelicans have all been used to try to explain his sighting but it still remains a mystery,' he added. These images were taken in Santa Ana, California on August 3, 1965 by highway worker Rex Heflin  using his Polaroid camera. This object supposedly flew over the Marine Corps El Toro Air Station in broad daylight, but no one else saw it. Distant objects are hazy because of the LA smog, while the UFO is not. Some suggest this is because it is small dust that was close to the camera . Pictured is the staff of Project Blue Book, which recorded more than 12,000 encounters with UFOs.

"There seems to be a wave of chargers that promise to speed up the time it takes to fully charge a phone or tablet. But many of the technologies are either concepts or in the very early stages of development. The SONICable is different - not only does it claim to halve the amount of time it takes to get a battery from zero to 100 per cent, it is available to pre-order for both iPhone and Android handsets now. Scroll down for video . When connected, but switched off, the SONICable acts like a standard USB cable and will charge the device as well as sync content.

"A Florida woman was horrified Sunday when she glanced over her shoulder while shopping at Walmart to find a man squatting on the floor with a camera trained up her skirt. The woman, who identifies herself to reporters only as Tenicka, says James King, 42, went to the Apopka department store specifically to take photos up the skirts of women. 'That was his Sunday afternoon plan, he came there with no cart, he wasn't shopping, he was shopping for a woman with a dress on,' the horrified 35-year-old told WKMG. Scroll down for video . Police say 42-year-old James King went to a Florida Walmart where he snapped photos up the skirt of a 35-year-old female shopper . Caught on camera: CCTV footage appears to show a man extending his phone beneath the skirt of the victim, who gave only her first name of Tenicka to reporters, at the Apopka department store . And the entire incident appears to have been captured on Walmart security cameras. CCTV footage clearly shows Tenicka perusing the Walmart aisles in a white dress. A male figure walks up close to her and extends his arm toward her person while kneeling beside her. Tenicka then turns and the jig is up. Tenicka did not approach the man herself, but sent her nephew to speak with him. The nephew then pursues the voyeur and snaps photos of him leaving the store. As he drives away, they jot down his license plate number, which is what would eventually lead police to King. 'I just feel so violated, disgusted, and embarrassed,' Tenicka said. 'It just doesn't seem real, I don't want to believe this really happened.' Tenicka sent her nephew to speak to King, seen here. The nephew also followed King as he fled the store and snapped pictures as proof. Tenicka jotted down his license plate number, which led police to King . Though he denied the accusations completely when questioned, King was soon arrested by local authorities. He's now bailed himself out of jail, WKMG reports. Police are investigating whether King may have previously targeted other women. 'I just feel so violated, disgusted, and embarrassed,' Tenicka said.

"A 90-year-old Icelandic man who lost his wedding ring in 1949 has had it returned just in time to celebrate his 65th wedding anniversary. Oskar Jonsson from Dalvik, a village in northern Iceland, had lost the wedding ring given to him by wife Elin Sigureoardottir, 85, just after they were married, and thought that it had fallen off on the road while he was clearing the snow. But in reality he had taken the ring off to do some repairs on machinery at his garage, and had placed it on a wooden ruler before forgetting about it. Still together: Oskar Jonsson had lost the wedding ring given to him by wife Elin Sigureoardottir just after they were married . The ruler had fallen behind the table, and remained there for the next 64 years until new garage owner Brynjar Aeoalsteinsson had called in workers to clean out the junk. He said: 'The place was a complete mess and I wanted it done up and made to look nice and they took everything out that was on the floor. 'One of the young lads that was cleaning up asked me if I'd seen the ruler, and I glanced at it but didn't immediately see the ring. 'It was only when I looked at it more closely did I see there was a ring and realised it was probably a wedding ring because of the inscription ""Your Elin"".' Lost and found: Jonsson lost his wedding ring in 1949, but had it returned just in time to celebrate his 65th wedding anniversary to wife Elin Sigureoardottir . He contacted local jewellers and advertised the wedding ring on Facebook and eventually it was suggested that the woman named might be Elin Sigureoardottir. Oskar said: 'I couldn't believe it when he gave me the ring. I had wanted to celebrate our wedding anniversary in November last year by giving her a ring but I was not very well so that plan was put on hold.' But now the couple have had their celebration complete with ring in style. Oscar added: 'The ring is as good as new, although I will have to wear it on a different finger. I lost my ring finger in an accident with a saw a short while after I lost the ring, and I never wore a ring after that ever again. Still, better late than never.'","Oskar Jonsson had lost the wedding ring given to him by wife Elin Sigureoardottir just after they were married .

"The horrific details surrounding the death of a three-year-old boy who was allegedly abused and killed by his mother and her boyfriend before his body was set alight have been revealed in court. Breanna Arnold, 21, was reportedly 'shooting dope' with her 30-year-old boyfriend, Zachary Barnes, and their 16-year-old friend at her trailer home in Bluffton,  Indiana, last Friday night. As the trio got high, they allegedly decided to 'put dope' in the bottles of Arnold's son, Owen Collins, and his six-year-old brother, who has not been named, so they could 'watch them have fun'. The following morning, Owen was found dead by his mother. Scroll down for video . Case: The horrific details surrounding the death of a three-year-old boy who was allegedly abused and killed by his mother, Breanna Arnold (right), and her boyfriend, Zachary Barnes (left) have been revealed in court . Allegations: Arnold (pictured being led to court on Tuesday), 21, was reportedly 'shooting dope' with 30-year-old Barnes and their 16-year-old unidentified friend at her trailer home in Bluffton, Indiana, last Friday night . Victim: As the trio got high, they allegedly decided to 'put dope' in the bottles of Arnold's son, Owen Collins (pictured), so they could 'watch him have fun'.The following morning, Owen was found dead by his mother . After Arnold alerted Barnes to her son's condition, he suggested they dispose of the child's body, the court heard. The pair then apparently wrapped Owen in a plastic bag and put him in a  drawer. On Sunday morning, Barnes and the teenage friend allegedly removed the youngster's corpse from the drawer, before placing it in a cardboard box and hitching a ride with a woman to Marion. While en route, they asked the woman to stop at a wooded area in Wells County, the court heard. Once there, they allegedly walked away from the car, before Barnes doused the box with nail polish remover and set it alight. They then got back into the woman's vehicle and resumed their journey. When Barnes and the teenager - who had apparently been living with the couple for several months and acted as their babysitter - arrived in Marion, Barnes told his brother Owen was missing. In following hours,  Wells County Sheriff’s Department launched a manhunt for the boy, during which they interviewed Arnold and searched hers and Barnes's house in Normandy Drive. Mug shots: After Arnold (left) alerted Barnes *(right) to her son's condition, he suggested they dispose of the child's body, the court heard.

Home: On Sunday, Wells County Sheriff’s Department launched a manhunt for the boy, during which they interviewed Arnold and searched hers and Barnes's trailer home (pictured) in Normandy Drive, Indiana . They eventually tracked down Barnes, the teenager and the woman. When told of the situation by officers, the woman led them to the wooded area that her passengers had stopped off at. There, police discovered Owen's badly-burned body at around 8pm on Sunday, the court heard. Now, Arnold and Barnes have been arrested and charged with preliminary felony counts of neglect of a dependent resulting in death. Barnes is also charged with abuse of a corpse, WANE.com reported. Meanwhile, the unidentified teenager is facing their own felony count of abuse of a corpse. During the hearing in Bluffton on Tuesday, the court heard that Arnold discovered her son's dead body in the trailer's back bedroom, before running to her boyfriend saying, 'my baby'. Sickeningly, while the couple were discussing what to do with Owen's corpse, there was even discussion about 'chopping him up and throwing him in the river', the teenager later told police. During a separate interview with officers, Barnes reportedly admitted to disposing of Owen's body out of fear, adding that he and Arnold would put 'dope in [the children’s] bottles and watch them have fun.' Police also found meth-making materials in the trailer, it is reported. Shocked: Following Tuesday's hearing, resident Teasha Stephen (pictured) said the 'disgraceful' details of the case had left her 'wanting to throw up'. She added: 'We hope these people get what they deserve - if not more' A notification from Indiana State Police indicating that known hazardous chemicals had been removed from the premises was seen pinned to the couple's front door on Tuesday, according to WISHTV.com. Following Tuesday's hearing, resident Teasha Stephen said the 'disgraceful' details of the case had left her 'wanting to throw up'.

"A top surfer has died after being shot outside his family home in Brazil during a row with an off-duty police and his younger brother. Ricardo dos Santos, 24, lost his fight for life on Tuesday afternoon, having reportedly been shot three times in the chest and stomach during the argument earlier on Monday morning. A police officer was last night being held in custody on suspicion of his murder. Ricardo dos Santos died on Tuesday after being shot three times outside his home in southern Brazil . According to one local report, the internationally-acclaimed surfer, who beat 11-times world champion Kelly Slater to win the 2012 Billabong Pro Tahiti Trials, is said to have found two people outside his home taking drugs. The report said dos Santo asked the men - later revealed to be a 25-year-old off-duty police officer and his 17-year-old brother - to move on, and an argument ensued. But a different report claimed one of the men had parked his car on top of a pipe that formed part of an extension Ricardo's family were building to their home, near Palhoca, Santa Catarina, southern Brazil. Police said they were investigating both claims, and the officer under arrest is said to be alleging he used his weapon in self-defence after being attacked first. Police chief Marcelo Arrudo said: 'We're looking at two very conflicting versions of events, one that involves self-defence and another that involves unjustified violence when there was no type of prior aggression that would explain those gunshots. 'We are in the process of organising a reconstruction as soon as possible so we can try to clarify what's happened.' dos Santos was described by former world number one Kelly Slater as 'truly one of the great barrel riders of his short time' His death has sent shock-waves around the surfing community, with fans and fellow pro-surfers expressing their condolences. Former world number one Slater took to Instagram to pay tribute to 'truly one of the great barrel riders of his short time'. 'This was truly a senseless loss of life,' he continued. 'Condolences to Ricardo's friends and family around the world. Our small community has lost another way too soon. Adriano de Souza, a Brazilian pro-surfer currently ranked at number eight in the world, also used social media to remember his 'great friend' on his official Facebook page. 'What about when you lose a person so cheerful, good heart and well with life as the Ricardinho?' he wrote. 'I have so many good memories in relation to him that it is difficult to choose one. 'But I want to keep forever in my mind these your qualities and your courage to move on.'","Ricardo dos Santos died on Tuesday after being rushed to hospital .

"Two-thirds of women believe in God compared to fewer than half of men, researchers found . Women are much more likely to believe in God and in life after death than men, researchers have found. Two-thirds have faith compared to fewer than half of men. Sixty per cent of women believe in the afterlife but only 35 per cent of men, said academics. There was also a gender split among atheists. Men were much more likely to be definite that death is the end – 63 per cent against 36 per cent of women. Study author Professor David Voas said: ‘Belief – or disbelief – in God and in life after death do not always go together. ‘Nearly a third of the people who believe in God do not believe in an afterlife.’ Just over half in the study said they were Christian. Most of the rest said they had no religion. The findings support growing indications that women are more religious and Christian churches increasingly rely on them as worshippers and ministers. The new study was published in advance of the consecration of the Reverend Libby Lane as the first woman bishop in the CofE in a service at York Minister next week. It said that the findings ‘arguably support the case for more women clergy.’ Professor Voas added: ‘Among believers, women are much more likely to be definite than men, and among non-believers, men are much more likely to be definite than women.’ But he said there was ‘no obvious answer’ as to why. The UCL Institute of Education, London, quizzed 9,000 people as part of the British Cohort Study which is following the lives of 17,000 people born in 1970. Among the 9,000 who contributed, 60 per cent of women believed in life after death, but only 35 per cent of men. Over half of the men did not believe in God – 54 per cent said they were atheists or agnostics. But only just over a third of the women, 34 per cent, said the same. But there was a difference between men and women even among the atheists. Men were much more likely than women to be fully convinced about that there is no life after death – 63 per cent of male atheists say they are definite that death is the end, against 36 per cent of women. Men were much more likely to be definite that death is the end – 63 per cent against 36 per cent of women .","Two-thirds of women have faith compared to fewer than half of men .

"A man who discovered his wife was cheating on him decided to share the heartbreaking experience with the general public by live-blogging the entire ordeal. After discovering text messages from another man on his wife's phone, the wronged husband, under the alias  MyLifeSuxNow, took to online community Reddit to share his woes. He then hired a private investigator and kept readers enthralled with a blow-by-blow account of his experience until the final confrontation with his unfaithful spouse. Scroll down for video . A Reddit user named MyLifeSuxNow blogged about his wife's infidelity, tracking her every move on the site (stock image) The anonymous blogger's story, which has yet to be confirmed by any of the people involved, began last Friday night when he found texts on his wife's phone. 'My wife is cheating on me as evidenced by filthy text messages, I know but she doesn't know that I do,' he says in his first post. He says he has been married to his wife, Jenny, for eight years after they met  when they had both graduated from university. He then goes on to say: 'I scroll up, and there are multiple nudes from both of them waiting for me to discover. Most of them are dated sometime between 1-4am (usually I'm sleeping then, smart) so I knew she was obviously trying to hide it from me.' 'She's cheating on me. They talk about sex positions they want to try... and one short conversation about meeting up this weekend. 'I've erased all trace of me breaking into her phone. I don't know what to do now. Jenny is cheating on me but we've had no major problems in the time we've been together.' After finding 'filthy texts' on his wife's phone, MyLifeSuxNow shared the pain of her betrayal online, even asking Reddit users for advice (stock image) The hurt husband then asks fellow Reddit users for advice: 'Should I tell her I know? Should we split and file divorce right away? He then adds: 'Goddammit I loved her. I have screenshotted the texts and emailed them to myself. 'I feel like someone has shot me in the stomach.' When his wife returns home, MyLifeSuxNow tries to act as if nothing's happened: 'It really sucks speaking to her normally, but I'm dealing with it. No sex. Also, I've found 3 excellent divorce lawyers for myself. 'Goddammit she's on her phone texting again in the bathroom. I can hear the send button being pressed over and over. It's probably nudes and sexy talk. 'Jeesus this hurts,' he says. He then decides to hire a private investigator to follow her, and gives minute-by-minute updates as he discovers the details of Jenny's affair with her lover Zack. 'Jenny met up at the front of a flathouse in a residential area and kissed a guy before she entered. It's Zack. Cheating confirmed. 'The PI is staking out Jenny and Zack's place. There will still be juicy updates if they leave the house I'm thinking so stay tuned I guess. I'm at a loss for words. In the next heart-wrenching statement he says: 'The pleasure of our love lasted a few years, the pain that came of this will last a lifetime.' He then continues to update the blog as the private investigator tracks his wife's movements. At 3:27pm he wrote: 'Zack and Jenny are relaxing on the front porch, just talking and holding hands. My PI is super far away, they can't see him but he can see them.' The next update at 3:38pm read: 'Zack and Jenny left Zack's house. PI is tailing them. Sigh. More suspense for us.' Then at 3:42pm: 'Zack and Jenny are heading towards the Starbucks shopping center. Don't know why, I'm guessing they already ate.' In another heartbreaking update he writes: 'Jenny texted me saying ""Hey babe, you wanna watch a movie tonight? Your pick."" I don't know if this is related to any of this or if it's just to throw me off. A staggering 15,000 users of Reddit offered the man advice on how to navigate the situation, much to his appreciation. 'Thank you all for the support these past few days, it has meant a lot to me,' he writes. Finally, MyLifeSuxNow confronts his wife: 'I can't type for more than a minute or two, but it isn't great. Yelling, anger, sadness, crying, a ton of crying, pleading, explaining, contradicting. The last update, posted on January 18 at 5.51pm, reads: 'A huge part of my life is falling apart around me.

"Syria's first lady is seen in public for the first time in months as air strikes by her husband's forces kill at least 39 people, more than half of them civilians. Pictures of Asma al Assad smiling with the young winners of the a science competition in Damascus have been uploaded on to the Syrian Presidency's Instagram and Facebook accounts today. President Bashar al-Assad's British-born wife has not been photographed in public for many months, and her appearance comes as government air strikes hit two main battlegrounds in the north of the country, according to the The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

Smiles: President Bashar al-Assad's British-born wife (centre) has not been photographed in public for many months . The British-based organisation has documented the deaths of at least 27 people in the attacks targeting the outskirts of Tal Hamis. Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said nine of those killed had been identified by his group as civilians. 'More of the dead may be civilians too, but we have not yet been able to confirm that,' Mr Rahman said. He added that Tal Hamis, situated in Hasakeh province which borders Iraq and which is home to a sizeable Kurdish population, is under the control of the Islamic State jihadist group. 'There are daily air regime and (US-led) coalition air strikes against IS positions in Hasakeh,' said Abdel Rahman. Today's bombing was especially deadly because it struck a cattle market. Earlier today, the observatory reported a string of air strikes against the town of Saraqeb and the village of Sheikh Mustafa in the northwestern province of Idlib. Eleven civilians were killed in Saraqeb, and another man died in Sheikh Mustafa, according to the group. Both towns are under jihadist control, though all of Tuesday's casualties there were civilians. Syrian President Assad pictured during a New Year's Eve visit to a combat zone.

"An escaped bull was shot dead by a sheriff's deputy after sending one man to the hospital with bruised ribs during its hours on the loose. The beast was one of seven bulls that escaped from  its pasture near Cornelius, a town west of Portland, Oregon, on Sunday night. Six were recaptured by farmers the same day, but one bull remained at large and passed through residential areas Monday afternoon, The Oregonian reported. The bull was loose from Sunday night through 2pm Monday, when it was shot by a sheriff's deputy in the field above . The bull was loose from Sunday night until it was killed by sheriff's deputy Michael Alexander at 2.19pm . The 800-pound animal had already been shot multiple times by local butchers and was visibly bleeding before it locked eyes with Morgan White while passing through his cul-de-sac around 2pm. 'I decided I'm going to make a run for it, which is probably my worst decision,' Mr White told KPTV. The bull charged the 23-year-old man, who had been outside smoking, as he attempted to flee, knocking him down and bruising his ribs. Morgan White, 23, was smoking outside his home when he saw the bull come into his cul-de-sac and locked eyes with the animal . ""I didn't hit my head. I didn't pass out, but everything kind of went black for a second,"" he said. Mr White, who compared the incident to being hit by a freight train, was taken to a hospital in Portland and released Monday evening. He said he was lucky that he wasn't trampled and his injuries weren't worse. The bull's owners, who remain unidentified, had called local butchers Jacobsmuhlen's Meats to dispatch the animal, which had partially sawed-off horns, after it didn't return to its farm. However two shots fired by the butchers were 'not effective at all' according to the Washington County sheriff's office. Sgt. Michael Alexander eventually shot the bull dead at 2.19pm after it crossed Tualatin Valley Highway, where traffic had been stopped, and stopped in a field about a quarter mile from Mr White's home. Employees from Jacobsmuhlen's Meats went into the field to retrieve the bull after it was downed. The bull broke free after flooding damaged the fence that kept it at its farm and the sheriff's office said that the owners would not receive a citation because a weather-related incident caused the escape. One of the six other bulls wandered into nearby Hillsboro on Sunday, but was captured by its owners.","Oregon man Morgan White, 23, locked eyes with bull passing his house .

"A young disabled football fan was turned away from watching Manchester United on his birthday - because the club wasn't warned he would be in a wheelchair. Autistic Tyler Short, 14, had joined his father Chris for the 530-mile round coach trip from their home to Old Trafford, with tickets from their local supporters club in Devon. He can walk short distances but also uses a wheelchair - and on the family's previous trips to the ground, Mr Short said they have folded up the chair and sat in the general seating area, rather than the disabled section. Autistic Tyler Short (right, with brother Harrison left), 14, had joined his father Chris for the 530-mile round coach trip from their home to Old Trafford. He can walk short distances but also uses a wheelchair . But before the match against Southampton last week, Mr Short was told he could not enter the ground with the wheelchair. Instead he was directed to the ticket office, where his tickets were confiscated because the names on the stubs did not match either Tyler or himself. Mr Short, a United member, bought the tickets through the North Devon branch of the supporters club and travelled on their coach. But the seats were on different rows and would have meant he could not sit next to his son. Mr Short said they have folded up the chair and sat in the general seating area, rather than the disabled section. But before the match against Southampton last week, Mr Short was told he could not enter the ground with the wheelchair . A United spokesman said: 'Season tickets are transferable to family members but individual match tickets are not. Fundamentally, the supporter should have informed us of his son's wheelchair needs prior to the game so that suitable seating could be found' To allow them to sit side-by-side, Mr Short was given another supporter's ticket on the coach while Tyler retained his original. Tyler's ticket was in the name of his older brother, Callum 18, who is also a United member. He said: 'My boy was crying his eyes out. He could not understand what was happening. 'I said to them 'I have come 300 miles. Look at the state of my son, he is crying his eyes out'.' Mr Short, 51, and Tyler were forced to wait outside the stadium until the game was over before rejoining their coach party for the journey back home to Bideford . In desperation, Dean Evans, from the North Devon Supporters Club, rang the ticket office to explain the situation, but the officials stood firm. Mr Evans said: 'I could hear his son crying. It was proper sobbing. I was getting quite irate with the bloke on the phone. 'Anybody with a bit of commonsense would have said ""go to your seat and we'll sort it out"".' Mr Short, 51, and Tyler were forced to wait outside the stadium until the game was over before rejoining their coach party for the journey back home to Bideford. Tyler, who was hoping to watch his favourite player Wayne Rooney, cried all the way. A United spokesman said: 'Season tickets are transferable to family members but individual match tickets are not. 'Fundamentally, the supporter should have informed us of his son's wheelchair needs prior to the game so that suitable seating could be found. 'The game was a sell out and so we could not re-house them even if they had not swapped tickets on the coach.' The Supporters Club reimbursed him for the cost of the two £50 tickets and the coach travel.","Autistic Tyler Short, 14, had joined his father Chris for the 530-mile trip .

"The father of an abuse victim has told a jury how the sex attacker's policewoman lover tried to talk him out of reporting the assault to the authorities. PC Sarah Cohen visited the parents just hours after they learned that their 14-year-old daughter had been groped during a sleepover party at an Air Training Corps hut in Devon. The drunken attack was carried out by Cohen's boyfriend James Reading, who organised the unofficial party in the squadron hut, Exeter Crown Court was told. PC Sarah Cohen, pictured, denies two counts of attempting to pervert the course of justice in relation to her former boyfriend James Reading who was convicted and jailed for sexual assaulting a 14-year-old girl . Cohen is on trial accused of perverting the course of justice by trying to persuade the parents of the teenaged girl not to report his attack. The victim's father told the jury she came to his house on the night the allegations came to light and warned them their daughter would have to re-live her ordeal in court if an official complaint was made. She also told him she would arrange treatment for Reading if they did not report his assault on their daughter to the police. Cohen, 36, from Lifton, Devon, denies two counts of perverting the course of justice in the two days after Reading sexually assaulted the girl in November 2011. She was Reading's girlfriend at the time and was also the Flight Lieutenant in charge of the ATC squadron in Devon where he was the Flight Sergeant. The jury have been told that Sgt Reading, 37, has been convicted and jailed for the sexual assault. The prosecution allege she intervened to prevent him being arrested after he armed himself with a hunting knife, drove to Meldon Dam on Dartmoor drunk, crashed his car, and threatened to commit suicide. James Reading, pictured, was in charge of a sleep-over at an Air Training Corps camp in Devon in 2011 when he sexually assaulted the 14-year-old girl . The jury have been told learned of the girl's complaint the next day and informed her father but the prosecution say she later tried to persuade him and his wife not to report Reading to the police. The girl's father said he had been at the sleepover party at which the assault happened but had been asleep after going on a pub crawl with Reading and having a glass of spirits-laced punch at the ATC hut. He was unaware that other male cadets had thrown Reading out of the hut, leading to the incident at Meldon, and his first knowledge of either incident was when Cohen came to the hut on the Sunday morning to send the cadets home. He saw her again the next evening when the squadron held their weekly parade and she informed him about the assault on his daughter after calling him into her office. He said: 'I cannot describe how a father feels when his daughter has been sexually assaulted. I was shocked. She was saying 'That's my Jamie. That's my Jamie' but did not seem to be that agitated. She was quite calm. 'I spoke to my daughter in the car on the way home but she did not say a lot. She came in on herself. I told my wife and we did not know whether to report it.' He said they rang Detective Superintendent Michelle Slevin, who they knew socially, who advised them to report the assault to the police and they were planning to do so the next morning when they were called by Cohen at around 11 pm. She came to their house and remained for about 90 minutes and told them Reading had made suicide attempts in the past and drawn matchstick pictures of people hanging themselves. Exeter Crown Court, pictured, heard that PC Cohen spent 90 minutes talking to the girl's family . The father said: 'She said she was in a dilemma because she was wearing three hats, her ATC hat, her girlfriend hat and her police hat. 'She said each of the hats had their own piece of advice. She said the easy one was a squadron boss because she had a duty to the cadets so she should report Reading to the police. 'Next came the girlfriend hat. She said if we did not report it she would make sure Jamie got treatment and never worked with cadets or children again. She said she had had him sectioned and taken to hospital. 'The third hat was her police hat. She said we were quite within our rights to report it to the police but we should bear in mind it would be a very difficult and trying time for our daughter. 'She said she would have to go through the courts and make a statement as a witness. She made it clear it would not be a very nice time for her and she would have to relive the assault again. 'She did not tell us to report the matter to the police or say she would report it to the police. I thought at the end we had the conversation so she could deliberately talk us out of reporting it to the police.' Cohen denies all the allegations. Her case is that she acted properly in going to Meldon to defuse a critical situation and that she could not have tried to influence the girl's parents because they had already reported the matter to another officer. The trial continiues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","James Reading molested the 14-year-old girl in November 2011 in Devon .

"Mark Wahlberg, pictured in November, arrives at the premiere for his latest movie The Gambler . Victims of one of Mark Wahlberg's racially-motivated attacks as a teenage delinquent in segregated Boston in the 1980s are divided over whether he should be granted a pardon for his crimes. Kristyn Atwood was among a group of mostly black fourth-grade students on a field trip to the beach in 1986 when Wahlberg and his white friends began hurling rocks and shouting racial epithets as they chased them down the street. 'I don't think he should get a pardon,' said Ms Atwood, now 38 and living in Decatur, Georgia. 'I don't really care who he is. It doesn't make him any exception. If you're a racist, you're always going to be a racist. And for him to want to erase it I just think it's wrong,' she said. Mary Belmonte, the white teacher who brought the students to the neighborhood beach that day, sees things differently. 'I believe in forgiveness,' she said. 'He was just a young kid - a punk - in the mean streets of Boston. He didn't do it specifically because he was a bad kid. He was just a follower doing what the other kids were doing.' The 43-year-old former rapper, Calvin Klein model and 'Boogie Nights' actor wants official forgiveness for a separate, more severe attack in 1988, in which he assaulted two Vietnamese men while trying to steal beer. That attack sent one of the men to the hospital and landed Wahlberg in prison. Wahlberg, in a pardon application filed in November and pending before the state parole board, acknowledges he was a teenage delinquent mixed up in drugs, alcohol and the wrong crowd. He points to his ensuing successful acting career, restaurant ventures and philanthropic work with troubled youths as evidence he's turned his life around. 'I have apologized, many times,' he said in December. 'The first opportunity I had to apologize was right there in court when all the dust had settled and I was getting shackled and taken away, and making sure I paid my debt to society and continue to try and do things that make up for the mistakes that I've made.' Court documents in the 1986 attack identify Wahlberg among a group of white boys who harassed a school group as they were leaving Savin Hill Beach in Dorchester, a mixed but segregated Boston neighborhood that had seen racial tensions during the years the city was under court-ordered school integration. Scroll down for video . Retired teacher Mary Belmonte reviews newspaper clippings she had collected about Mark Wahlberg at her home in Massachusetts. She believes  Wahlberg should be considered for a pardon following a racially-motivated attack he was part of at the age of 15 . The boys chased the black children down the street, hurling rocks and racial epithets including 'Kill the n-----s!' until an ambulance driver intervened. Wahlberg was 15 at the time. Atwood still bears a scar from getting hit by a rock. No one was seriously injured, but the attack left other invisible - and indelible - scars. 'I was really scared. My heart was beating fast. I couldn't believe it was happening. The names. The rocks. The kids chasing,' Belmonte said. Wahlberg and two other white youths were issued a civil rights injunction: essentially a stern warning that if they committed another hate crime, they would be sent to jail. In 1988, Wahlberg, then 16, attacked two Vietnamese men while trying to steal beer near his Dorchester home. According to the sentencing memorandum, he confronted Thanh Lam, a Vietnamese immigrant, as he was getting out of his car with two cases of beer. The 43-year-old  actor wants official forgiveness for a separate, more severe attack in 1988 when he was a teen (left), in which he assaulted two Vietnamese men, including Johnny Trinh (right), while stealing beer . Wahlberg called Lam a 'Vietnamese f------ s---' and beat him over the head with a 5-foot wooden stick until Lam lost consciousness and the rod broke in two. Documents say Wahlberg ran up to another Vietnamese man, Hoa Trinh, and asked for help hiding. After a police cruiser drove past, he punched Trinh in the eye. Later, he made crude remarks about 'slant-eyed gooks.' Wahlberg ultimately was convicted of assault and battery, marijuana possession and criminal contempt for violating the prior civil rights injunction. Judith Beals, a former state prosecutor involved in the cases, said Wahlberg's crimes stand out because he violated the injunction with an even more violent attack on people of yet another race. 'It was a hate crime and that's exactly what should be on his record forever,' Atwood said. Judith Beals, a former prosecutor, secured a civil rights injunction against a young Wahlberg in 1986 after he hurled rocks and racial epithets at black schoolchildren. She said the actor should not be pardoned as he has requested for a separate attack on two Asian men .","Kristyn Atwood was among a group of mostly black fourth-graders on a field trip in 1986 when Wahlberg and his white friends began hurling rocks .

"A Galveston County jury has found a man who was nicknamed 'Money Mike' by his teen accusers guilty of sexual assault. The jury found Michael McIntosh, 63, guilty of handing out wads of cash to teenagers from Clear Creek and Clear Springs high school to entice them to his Friendswood home for sexual acts. He was convicted of a second-degree felony, punishable by up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $10,000. Scroll down for video . Ring leader: Michael Wayne McIntosh - known as 'Money Mike' to his victims - appears in court on Tuesday as he stands trial for three counts of sexual assault of a child of which he was convicted . The prosecution will now decide whether to pursue a new trial on three additional indictments against McIntosh on sexual assault on a child. Eight girls, aged 17 when they met McIntosh in 2013  gave testimony and were visibly worried by the questions that were being asked, according to The Houston Chronicle. Many asked them to recall incidents of graphic sexual encounters at the 63-year-old's house. The girls, names have been withheld but they described how McIntosh would hand out hundred dollar bills to girls working as hostesses at Webster restaurants. One of those hostesses was charged but never indicted with prostitution and she agreed to testify only after prosecutors agreed to drop the charge several weeks before the trial. Defense attorney Charles Thompson tried to convince jurors that her testimony against McIntosh was suspect. Den of prostitution: Prosecutors say the 63-year-old man lured high school girls to his home in Friendswood, Texas where he paid them hundreds of dollars to perform sexual favors. Above, the address connected to McIntosh according to public records . In opening arguments on Tuesday, McIntosh's defense attorney Charles Thompson took a bold stand in telling the jury that the eight victims are not to be trusted. 'At the end of the day you are not going to find any of these women credible,' Thompson said on the first day of the trial. He explained that one of the girls, initially arrested for allegedly helping arrange the dates between her friends and McIntosh, is only testifying because the prosecution agreed to drop the charges against her. 'They have cut a deal where she doesn't get into trouble in order win this case,' he said. The prosecution admits that they did agree not to pursue the charges, but that they made no binding agreement. And two of the other victims are currently in the midst of civil lawsuits against McIntosh, with their families seeking $2.5million for emotional damage. 'They thought there was going to be a payday for this, like prostitutes do,' Thompson told jurors. That harsh portrayal was not echoed on the stand when one of the girls testified yesterday. A girl identified as 'Stephanie' said she was 15 at the time when she first met McIntosh in the summer of 2013 through a friend at Ojos Locos Restaurant, and her eyes welled with tears as she was asked to point out in court the grey-haired man in a dark blue suit. Meeting place: One of the girls who took the stand  says she met McIntosh through a friend at this restaurant in southeast Houston. She says she later performed oral sex on him in exchange for $300 for books . She said after meeting at the restaurant, she and her four friends reconvened with McIntosh at a gas station where he fueled up their car. They then went over to his house for about an hour, during which he gave all four girls $100. Following a known method by pedophiles, McIntosh did not try to initiate sexual contact with the girls that night. It was only later, when she texted him asking for $300 dollars for books, that he asked her to do him a favor in return. Stephanie says her boyfriend drover her over to McIntosh's house, and waited outside while she went in to meet the old man. He took her into a bedroom and asked her to perform oral sex. She says she remained fully clothed during the brief encounter and quickly made an excuse to leave with her money when it was over. McIntosh allegedly started the ring after becoming close with a 16-year-old girl he met at a local restaurant. Heavy charges: McIntosh will face 20 years in prison pictured above entering court on Tuesday . After befriending her by leaving several large tips of $100 or more, he invited her over to his house, and convinced her to bring her 'easily manipulated' friends. She recruited these girls, between the ages of 14 and 17, from Clear Springs High School and Clear Creek High School. When the meetings turned sexual, McIntosh would pay the girls thousands of dollars, and the girl allegedly took her cut of the cash. When a prosecutor asked one of the victims how she spent her money, she said she used it on food, purses, jeans and a tanning membership. One of the questions that has been charging through this case is how the girls were able to spend so much time at McIntosh's house without raising an alarm with their parents. Some of the victims said they simply lied about where they were. Other aspects of the ring were much harder to conceal. 'There was a time I fell asleep and my mom went through my purse and found a thousand dollars and questioned me about it. I told her I was holding the money for my friend,' said one witness.","The trial for Michael Wayne McIntosh started last Tuesday in Texas .

A detainee at Guantanamo Bay says he was tortured and forced to have sex with female interrogators in his new book. The claims come in the memoir of current inmate Mohamedou Ould Slahi, which was published earlier this week following a six-year legal battle to declassify the handwritten manuscript. The 44-year-old swore allegiance to al-Qaeda after travelling to Afghanistan in the 1990s and fought against the Soviet Union-backed regime, but claims he left the group in 1992. He was detained following the 9/11 attacks on suspicion of involvement in an unsuccessful plot to bomb Los Angeles in 1999. He was taken to Cuba in 2002 following interrogation in Mauritania, Jordan and Afghanistan. In the new book he recalls in a partly redacted account of how he was told he was going to be taught about 'great American sex' and sexually abused by two female prison guards. In an extract published on Speigel Online he wrote: 'I stood up in the same painful position as I had every day for about 70 days. 'I would rather follow the orders and reduce the pain that would be caused when the guards come to play; the guards used every contact opportunity to beat the hell out of the detainee. 'As soon as I stood up, the two _______ took off their blouses, and started to talk all kind of dirty stuff you can imagine, which I minded less. 'What hurt me most was them forcing me to take part in a sexual threesome in the most degrading manner. Both _______ stuck on me, literally one on the front and the other older _______ stuck on my back rubbing ____ whole body on mine. Scroll down for video . 'At the same time they were talking dirty to me, and playing with my sexual parts' He also recalled how he continued to pray during the abuse but was then berated. He wrote how he was told to 'Stop the f*** praying' and told that he was a hypocrite. He added: 'I refused to stop speaking my prayers, and after that, I was forbidden to perform my ritual prayers for about one year to come. 'I also was forbidden to fast during the sacred month of Ramadan October 2003, and fed by force.' The brother of Slahi, Yahdih Ould Slahi shows some the redacted pages of his older siblings' Guantanamo Diary, which was launched at a press conference in London today . In the book 'Guantanamo Diary' Slahi also claims he only confessed to various terror plots, including one to bomb the CN Tower in Toronto after being tortured and humiliated. Describing the toll of life inside the jail at the US base in Cuba, Slahi added: 'I started to hallucinate and hear voices as clear as crystal. I heard my family in a casual familial conversation…. I heard Qur'an readings in a heavenly voice. 'I heard music from my country. Later on the guards used these hallucinations and started talking with funny voices through the plumbing, encouraging me to hurt the guard and plot an escape. 'I was on the edge of losing my mind.' The detainee's lawyer, Nancy Hollander, explained that her client has never been charged with any crime and says he should be released. She said: 'It's not that they haven't found the evidence against him -– there isn't evidence against him. 'He's in what I would consider a horrible legal limbo, and it's just tragic: he needs to go home. Video courtesy of RT . Slahi's lawyer Nancy Hollander says that her client has never been charged with any crime and she says he should be released . Meanwhile the American Civil Liberties Union has launched an online petition demanding his release. Hina Shamsi, director of the ACLU's national security project said: 'Mohamedou Slahi is an innocent man whom the United States brutally tortured and has held unlawfully for over a decade. 'He doesn't present a threat to the US and has never taken part in any hostilities against it.' Benedict Cumberbatch and Jude Law are among a host a celebrities who have recorded readings from the diary of the Guantanamo Bay detainee. Narrations by the actors from Slahi's account are being released today to mark the publication of a book based on the journal, as well as a campaign for him to be freed after being held in the prison camp for more than a decade. Readings by other high profile figures including the author Philip Pullman, actor Dominic West and musician Brian Eno are set to follow in the coming days, while recordings featuring Stephen Fry and Colin Firth have already been released. At a press conference in London today to launch the book and a campaign for the detainee's release, his younger brother Yahdih Ould Slahi said: 'If you read the book you can see every line, every word is written with the blood and tears.' Slahi was taken to the detention centre at Guantanamo Bay, pictured, in 2002 on suspicion of being involved in a plot to bomb Los Angeles in 1999 . He described his family's pride in the publication of the book. 'He gave a voice to all the people that are suffering in similar situations,' he said. Larry Siems, the editor of the book, described Slahi as 'one of the most abused prisoners in Guantanamo' and said his writings detail 'harrowing' treatment. He said: 'The torture squad were so well trained that they were performing almost perfect crimes, avoiding leaving any obvious evidence. 'Nothing was left to chance. They hit in pre-defined places. They practised horrible methods, the aftermath of which would only manifest later.'","Mohamedou Ould Slahi published his memoir of his time in Guantanamo .

"A police officer was caught on camera repeatedly punching a man who is lying face down on the ground and not resisting, in the latest footage of apparent brutality by American police. The video, captured by a bystander, shows the police officer pounding the victim at least five times around the head as a terrified witness asks why the attack was necessary. The victim, whose name is not known, was not arrested after the attack, which took place outside a nightclub in Columbia, the state capital of South Carolina. A grab from the video showing policeman Tyrone Pugh kneeling on a man and beating him after a fight broke out outside a nightclub where he and other officers were working off-duty. This picture has been lightened . But Columbia Police Investigator Tyrone Pugh has been suspended without pay pending the outcome of internal investigations after the video went viral on Instagram, reports South Carolina paper The State. The 15-second video of the attack on the early hours of Sunday morning shows Pugh repeatedly battering the man in a car park outside a nightclub. It shows the policeman kneeling on top of the man, who is on the ground and on his side, beating him and shouting: 'Stay on the ground! Stay on the ground!' Robyn Hogg, 19, who filmed the incident on her mobile phone and can be heard shouting at the officer in the footage, told The State that the victim had been standing close to where a scuffle had broken out. The officer grabbed him, threw him to the ground and started punching him, she said. 'He said, ""I didn’t do anything."" He wasn’t resisting. I think it was unnecessary. Two other cops there were aggressive but not like that,' Miss Hogg said. Miss Hogg said the incident occurred when a fight broke out after a party of about 300 people at the Columbia Soundstage to celebrate her upcoming 20th birthday. Pugh was one of five uniformed Columbia police officers working off-duty at the venue. Two 23-year-old men were arrested and charged with fighting, although the man hit by Pugh was not. Pugh has been suspended without pay pending the outcome of internal investigations after the 15-second video of the attack went viral on Instagram amid a general outcry over police brutality in America . The incident comes amid outrage in the U.S. at apparent police brutality, which has seen the deaths of a number of people at the hands of officers who are able to act with apparent impunity. Protests spread across the nation following the shooting death of Michael Brown, a young unarmed black man, at the hands of a white police officer last August. On July 17, 2014, Eric Garner died in Staten Island, New York, after a police officer put him in a chokehold - a restraint banned by the New York Police Department. The police shootings of unarmed Akai Gurley in New York City and Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old with a toy gun, in Cleveland, Ohio, also contributed to a widespread and growing animosity towards police in the U.S. in the past year. Columbia police confirmed that Pugh and the other man involved in the incident were both African American. Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin told The State: '(The video) left me gravely concerned as to what the possible circumstances might have been, and I shared that with the chief and he acted accordingly.'","The man shown being beaten was not arrested after the incident .

"Gordon Ramsay faces a £10.8million bill for rent over the next 17 years after losing a High Court battle over one of his London restaurants. The celebrity chef will have to find a further £1.6million in legal fees and outstanding rental payments for the gastropub at the centre of the row. Ramsay’s personal ‘kitchen nightmare’ stems from a bitter dispute with his estranged father-in-law Christopher Hutcheson, who was chief executive of his businesses until he was forced out in 2010. Scroll down for video . Hearing: Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay has lost his High Court battle over being held personally liable for the rent on a London pub he bought. He's pictured with wife Tana after giving evidence . Ramsay, 48, accused Hutcheson of using a ‘ghost writer’ machine to put his signature – without his consent – on a 25-year contract for the York and Albany pub near Regent’s Park in north London. Such machines are often used by authors, celebrities and even royalty to sign books, papers and photographs automatically. But Chancery Division judge Mr Justice Morgan yesterday poured scorn on Ramsay’s claim that he had been duped over the agreement to guarantee the pub’s £640,000 annual rent. The superchef accused his father-in-law, Mr Hutcheson (pictured), of forging his signature . In a scathing judgment, Mr Justice Morgan dismissed as ‘entirely implausible’ Ramsay’s assertion that he did not know the full extent of the use of the signature machine. He added: ‘Accordingly, I find that Mr Ramsay knew, long before the entry into the agreement for lease and the lease of the [York & Albany] premises, that the machine was routinely used to place his signature on legal documents. ‘I do not accept his evidence to the contrary. 'I find that when Mr Hutcheson committed Mr Ramsay to the guarantee in the lease of the premises, Mr Hutcheson was acting within the wide general authority conferred on him by Mr Ramsay at all times until Mr Hutcheson’s dismissal in October 2010. ‘Mr Ramsay may now regret the transaction in relation to the premises. 'He may particularly regret his involvement as a guarantor. 'He may consider that Mr Hutcheson did a bad deal. ‘However, on any finding, he is not able to say that Mr Hutcheson exceeded his authority in any respect. ' Mr Ramsay – acting through his agent Mr Hutcheson – is bound by the guarantee in the lease of the premises.’ At the time of the deal in 2007 Mr Hutcheson was very much at the helm of Gordon Ramsay Holdings. He left in 2010 after an acrimonious split with the chef who accused him of plundering £1million from his firm. Last year actor and film director Gary Love – who owns the York and Albany premises – had described the chef’s High Court challenge as an ‘absurd’ attempt to wriggle out of his rental commitments. Ramsay’s businesses won a bidding war to secure the 160-year-old building in the exclusive Regent’s Park area. The chef – who has starred in a number of TV food programmes including Hell’s Kitchen and Kitchen Nightmares – has since turned the historic pub into an upmarket restaurant, bar and hotel. When giving evidence at the court last November Ramsay’s wife Tana claimed both her father and brother Adam had been ‘systematically defrauding’ her celebrity husband. She also told how she remembered the ‘shock on Gordon’s face’ when the couple’s solicitor told them that the lease for the York & Albany included a personal guarantee from him for 25 years. The chef can still ask the Court of Appeal to hear his case – a path which sources close to Ramsay say he may be considering. His legal bill is estimated at around £750,000 while Mr Love is now expected to claim around £600,000 in outstanding rent. In addition, the judge ordered him to make an interim payment to Mr Love of £250,000 within 28 days. The chef’s personal fortune is understood to be around £80million. Last night Ramsay’s spokesman said: ‘We are obviously disappointed but do not regret bringing this issue to court. We are now reviewing the options available to us.’ Dispute: Mr Ramsay claimed that a ghost writer machine was used to forge his signature on the lease for the York & Albany pub (pictured), near Regent's Park .","Gordon Ramsay disputed being liable for rent on London pub he bought .

"Students at a Florida high school were forced to scatter on Friday night after a gunman opened fire in the parking lot. The shots rang out following a basketball game in the gym at Vanguard High School in Ocala, Florida around 9.30pm. A 14-year-old girl, who attends Howard Middle School, was shot in the arm.

A bullet was fired through the windshield after a gunman opened fire at a Florida high school on Friday night . Local 6 reported that the 19-year-old suffered injuries to her neck from glass shards. She did not want to reveal her identity for fear of reprisals. The school was immediately placed on lock down following the gun fire. Police found a white car that they believed to hold a shooting suspect. One person was held by police out of the four traveling in the vehicle at the time. However no suspects were taken into custody and the shooter remains at large. Several parents told Local 6 that their children were afraid to go to school following the apparent random shooting. A basketball game has been scheduled at Vanguard High on Tuesday against Lake Minneola High School. Daily Mail Online had reached out to Marion County Public Schools to see if the game would go ahead tonight but had received no response at the time of publication.

"For Radovan Peric and his family, real life is in the mountain, with their forty goats. 'This is the way my ancestors lived, it's my fate,' he tells me, liberally sloshing more home-distilled grappa into shot glasses. In the thirty years he has lived with his wife, and later his daughters and granddaughter, in this simple home perched on the hillside above the Kotor old town and the bow-­tie shaped southern part of the bay, he has seen cataclysmic change, the landscape pushed and pulled by tradition versus progression. Once, communist-owned factories chugged below; now, ecology is thriving, Peric grows all his own food and only descends for beer, coffee and sugar. A view over Kotor Bay from the home of Radovan Peric and his family, who live the simple life away from the modernisation of Montenegro . Apart from the odd horror during the Eurovision Song Contest I knew little about Montenegro, except that it sounded green, but somehow moody and grey, in the shadow of huge mountains ­and of course, that lots of millionaires live there. Now, daring to dip a toe into the world of multi­-generational holiday, I'm here with my mother, and I see that I was right. But of course, that's just the tip of the iceberg. We begin in Tivat, where the biggest news is the 287 million euro Porto Montenegro – baby of Canadian gold­miner Peter Monk, which calls itself the Adriatic sea's first megayacht marina. Once a military factory with large berths once for warships, now home to behemoth yachts where discerning super rich can remain anonymous and enjoy the deliciously swanky Regent hotel, a sophisticated nightclub, three tennis courts, five lavish restaurants, lido swimming pool and 45 shops metres of retail space. Aman Sveti Stefan became an Adriatic playground for the rich and famous in the 1960s  but the break-up of Yugoslavia saw its decline . The peaceful waters of Kotor Bay: Here, old men sit contented with their coffee and cigarettes, enjoying the quiet life . Superyachts up to 80-foot long and megayachts over 164-foot long cost between £15,000 and £40,000 per year to moor here but I'm told per metre of yacht, owners pay one million euros, so it's a mere drop in the ocean. But the most curious thing here is 165-foot 1969 Yugoslave submarine pitched up next to the 210-foot infinity pool and Scaramanga, the nightclub. It was bought from the Ministry of Defence for a large, unnamed sum and then brought back to life by its last Captain. It seems jarring to see such a blatant reminder of communism in amongst all this pomp. Luxury tourism is everywhere. In Budva, looking over the city scape, Petar, our guide says 'Fifteen years ago if you told me this was Budva, I'd think it had been photoshopped.' Money talks in this city; high rise luxury apartments and resorts are popping up like unruly creepers. The infinity pool at Villa Vita in Budva, a beautiful cluster of villas with its own herd of goats and onsite cheese and yoghurt making . Madonna and the Rolling Stones have stayed at Hotel Splendid in the infamously flambouyant royal suite. Now in low season there are cranes and building works dot the horizon. We stay at Villa Vita, a beautiful cluster of villas with its own herd of goats. It is luxurious in its simplicity. There is a room here devoted to Tito and old Yugoslavia with paintings and trinkets from before the nineties when communism shut down – and in homage to simpler times, the owners make their own cheese and yoghurt. But then there's the pool. What a pool. 'I've never been in an infinity pool before,' says mum. 'What happens if you swim over the edge?' In the morning,  Petar takes us to the wine cellar where we all drink brandy at 9am. Apparently it thins the blood, so it's health-­giving in a sense. I'm not convinced, but it tastes great.

Food in Montenegro was traditionally divided by wealth, with the poorer north accompanying every meal with bread, cheese and meat. On the coast, fish and seafood rule, with specialities including black risotto. Wine is good here, too, especially if you can't stomach the endless shots of grappa. We visit Aman Sveti Stefan, something of a staple for tourists to Montenegro - a tiny islet consumed by one single hotel resort, Villa Milocer. Once, the summer resident of the Queen, it became an Adriatic playground for the rich and famous in the 1960s and 1970s, but the break-up of Yugoslavia saw its decline. After a painstaking refurbishment which saw each of the original bricks that were removed, returned to their original position, the beautiful site is now a five-star franchise hotel owned by the Aman group, with 58 rooms, cottages and suites, and high profile guests such as Roman Abramovich. Workers relax of Kings and Queens beaches, were in high season tourists pay through the nose for a beach package, including towels and an umbrella.

This was once the was once safest place to live in Montenegro, now Peric's house and the crumbled remains of the village of Spirali are all that is left. The fabric of Montenegro is changing, each stitch taking it further from the simple Slavic holiday destination it once was. Now, for the heavy-pocketed there is almost too much. But for everyone else, there's enticing, beautiful greenery; including four national parks and Europe's last remaining rainforest; sumptuous food; and a truly fascinating history.","Adriatic beauty spot has reinvented itself as a five-star holiday destination for super wealthy yacht owners .

"Cookie brand Oreo has finally put its fans out of their misery and confirmed that it will be launching a new red velvet flavor to its limited edition line-up - just in time for Valentine's Day. Much like the iconic cupcake that helped to inspire it, Oreo's newest sandwich cookie flavor features a red-colored chocolate cookie base and a cream cheese frosting-flavored filling, making a move away from the original cookies and cream flavor that the brand is best known for. Rumors about the new cookie flavor first began back in October, when a tweet was published featuring a picture of what appeared to be the new Red Velvet Oreo packaging. Introducing Red Velvet! Oreo has announced the launch of its latest cookie variety . But, determined to keep the new sweet treat under the radar until 2015, the brand remained quiet about the tweet, which was soon deleted from the site, prompting some cookie fans to question whether the image was indeed a hoax. 'You may remember that a few months ago, there was speculation about an Oreo Red Velvet cookie,' a spokesperson for the brand explained to Daily Mail Online. 'It’s true, but we just weren’t ready to reveal the news back then as [the flavor] wasn't going to be available in US stores nationwide until February 2 – but we’re ready to confirm, its official.' The launch, which will no doubt be welcomed by long-time fans of the much-loved sandwich cookie, comes just four months after Daily Mail Online exclusively revealed Oreo's last limited edition flavor, pumpkin spice, which was introduced to customers during the fall season last year. But this latest flavor marks a new milestone for the brand, featuring the first new cookie flavor - and color - since the debut of its vanilla-flavored Golden Oreo in 2004. 'Uniquely, Red Velvet Oreo features a new cookie flavor (and color) for the first time since the debut of our Golden Oreo,' the spokesperson added. Red for romance: The new cookie variety has been launched just in time for Valentine's Day . Baked brilliance: Inspired by the iconic red velvet cupcake recipe, the new cookies feature a cream cheese frosting filling . 'The variety embodies a mix of the chocolate Oreo cookie taste fans love with a cream cheese-flavored crème for red velvet fanatics.' But how does the new flavor fare when put to the ultimate taste test? US Femail Editor Tamara Abraham was happy with the overall result, but felt that the cookies needed to be brighter in order to capture the true red velvet effect. 'They’re not as red as I’d hoped they’d be – and kind of taste like fake strawberry flavoring, in a good way,' she said, after trailing her first cookie. 'There’s a definite hint of cream cheesiness that I like too.' Sean Walsh, Daily Mail Online's Director of Communications, was thrilled with the new addition to the Oreo line-up however, saying: 'I would eat the whole packet – they taste like cake.' Overall, it was agreed that the new cookies do a good job of capturing the true red velvet cake flavor, with US Femail Writer Erica Tempesta adding: 'They tasted just like a cupcake, and I was a fan of the cookie’s new color. 'But they were a little too sweet to consume more than a couple, which is probably a good thing!' Oreo's new Red Velvet cookies will be available in stores from February 2 .","Speculation about the new variety first started to surface back in October, after a picture of the Red Velvet Oreo packaging was leaked on Twitter .

"High street brands such as Topshop and H&M have seen online sales of women's jeans to men rise by a third as guys buy ever-skinnier denims. While tight jeans have been part of the hipster uniform for a few years, a new sales spike indicates that men feel that the usual men's skinny cut just isn't tight enough. The circulation-constricting legwear - dubbed the Ex-Girlfriend Jean - has been championed by the likes of Joey Essex, Harry Styles, Russell Brand and Jamie Hince. Scroll down for video . Harry Styles was pictured in 2014 wearing a pair of women's Paige Denim jeans . Menswear expert Oliver Tezcan from online fashion store TheIdleMan.com said that skinny jeans hunters are disappointed by the conventional men's cut which is too loose at the ankle, calf and thighs, driving them to the women's section instead. He said: 'High street retailers have seen a significant number of men in the past six months. 'These are guys who are buying women's skinny jeans for themselves so that they can have a super-skinny look. 'Admittedly, a lot of them are buying online rather than in-store, clearly to avoid the embarrassment of having to try on the jeans in a womenswear shop.' Oliver added: 'The reason for this pretty unusual move is that many high street menswear shops have failed to keep up with the increasing trend for even tighter jeans. Jacques (left) and Kofi (right) both choose women's jeans because they like the tighter fit that they give . Increasing numbers of men are snapping up women's skinny jeans for a snug fit . 'Last season quite a few hipster jeans brands that we stock brought out super-skinny 'spray on' jeans and the demand for them was incredible and they sold out in a couple of weeks. 'The high-street wasn't as quick to pick up on this trend – which is much tighter at the ankle, calf and thighs and so a lot of male high-street shoppers are now having to buy the women's version instead to emulate the super-skinny style.' Personal trainer Kofi Gay, 21 from west London, wears women's H&M skinny regular jeans in a size 29/30. Meanwhile, Jacques Chinnery, 20, a supermarket supervisor from Orpington, Kent who loves his Topshop MOTO Blue Black Baxter women's jeans in a waist size 30/30. He said: 'The look is slimmer and tighter than the men's version. 'They are skin-tight at the ankle, calf and thigh and there's actually more room at the front that some of the men's jeans, so they are pretty comfortable. 'I wear them because I think they look better on than the mens' styles in the high street. 'Some of the men's designer jeans brands have the super-skinny look but I can't always afford to buy designer ones, and no one can tell the difference anyway. 'If I hadn't told you that these are girls' jeans you wouldn't know, it's not like they've got pink stitching or flowers on them. 'The only downside is that they are pretty hard to get on and off.' The trend for skinny jeans has been in for some time now, starting around 2001, but recently styles got significantly tighter. It has previously been reported that Mr Styles likes to wear women's jeans designed by American brand Paige Denim. While Joey Essex has previously admitted that he also likes ladies legwear as it gives him a snugger fit than men's. Russell Brand is known for his love of skinny jeans although he has never revealed if they're women's or not . Joey Essex is a keen proponent of the super-skinny denim trend, wearing jeans that often look like leggings . In 2011 Levi's launched their own pair of 'ex-girlfriends jeans', inspired by the 'boyfriend jean', a looser fit for women based around the idea of female denim fans borrowing their other halves' jeans. The company used women's denim but tailored them to fit a man's body. However, this craze for super-skinny trousers could have some dangerous side effects. A survey by incontinence brand TENA,  found that 10 per cent of British men said they had experienced unpleasant side effects from wearing tight jeans. One quarter of the men experienced a bladder infection, one fifth had a twisted testicle, and low sperm count and fungal infections were also cited.","Brands like Topshop and H&M have seen a surge in sales of ladies' jeans .

"A best-selling author fears the manuscript of her new novel has been reduced to ashes by a mystery fire that ripped through her £2.5million townhouse. Daisy Goodwin wept last night as she told how the book was on a laptop computer that had been consumed by flames. She, her husband and their two daughters, Lydia, 14, and Ottilie, 23, were not at their home when the fire broke out on the first floor. At least we’re safe: Daisy Goodwin with her daughter Lydia, 14, who were not at home when the fire began . But their cleaner was in the basement and managed to flee – only to bravely return to rescue the family’s three dogs. A baby and two women in a neighbouring property also escaped after the flames spread to their building via the attic. They were treated for smoke inhalation by paramedics. Sixty fire officers took two and a half hours to extinguish the blaze in West Kensington, London, on Monday. Last night Mrs Goodwin, who penned the historical novels The Fortune Hunter and My Last Duchess, said: ‘It’s awful. I still can’t believe it.’ Earlier she posted on Twitter: ‘So my house has actually burnt down, or half of it. Feel like I am in the Old Testament. London Fire Brigade damp down Daisy Goodwin's home following the fire yesterday afternoon . Saved: Marcus Wilford (left), the husband of author Daisy Goodwin (right), with the dogs that were rescued . ‘I am grateful to the fire brigade for coming so quickly, and to everyone who helped, and I’m glad everyone was alright.’ She was at her local library when her husband, TV executive Marcus Wilford, 54, phoned to tell her about the fire. Neighbours had dialled 999 after seeing smoke pouring from the roof. Mrs Goodwin said: ‘I think the dogs will be fine. I’m worried about my younger daughter’s homework. Her GCSE coursework’s been destroyed.’ She added: ‘I think the novel is backed up somewhere in the Cloud but I just don’t know.’ The family are now in a hotel.

'The goal of the DRC is to generate groundbreaking research and development in hardware and software that will enable future robots, in tandem with human counterparts, to perform the most hazardous activities in disaster zones, thus reducing casualties and saving lives,' it said. The teams using the DARPA-developed Atlas robot will use an entirely new version, which is battery powered for the first time. The Atlas robot created by Google-owned firm Boston Dynamics is a formidable figure at 6ft 2in tall and weighing in at 330lb. The robot boasts 28 hydraulically actuated joints and stereo vision, and is one of the most advanced robots ever created. Atlas will also now carry an onboard 3.7-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack, with the potential for one hour of 'mixed mission' operation that includes walking, standing, use of tools, and other movements. The upgraded Atlas is 75 percent new—only the lower legs and feet were carried over from the original design . Gill Pratt, of DARPA said: 'Atlas unplugged is the upgrade to allow it to run entirely on batteries. 'We have to cut the cord.' 'The new Atlas is 75% new, it has much more dexterity and is quieter, and stronger. 'The introduction of a battery and variable-pressure pump into Atlas poses a strategic challenge for teams,' said Pratt. 'The operator will be able to run the robot on a mid-pressure setting for most operations to save power, and then apply bursts of maximum pressure when additional force is needed.' During the finals, a series of events will be held to replicate disasters. 'The finals will be very hard. We want them to be more like real disasters, the robots will have to do all these tasks in sequence with no human help. Given their identical hardware, the Atlas teams will have to differentiate themselves through software, control interfaces, and competition strategy. The man sized machine can finally operate without wires, thanks to a battery backpack . Teams will have a few options on the selection of tasks they choose to attempt and the order they do them—and must manage time and battery life during their runs—but DARPA expects that the top-placing teams will complete all of the tasks. Teams are likely to keep their robots connected to fall arrestors during much of the remaining months of training as a safeguard against premature damage to the robot. DARPA demonstrated the new Atlas with a fall arrestor in place. 'Risk mitigation is part of the game,' Pratt said. 'It's up to the teams to decide what chances they're willing to take during training and risk falls and damage, but come the DRC Finals, the cords are cut.' For fans of the cult film the Karate Kid, it is a familiar pose. However, in the latest video from the US military team developing a two legged fighting robot, the buildup to 'crane kick' is seen in a new way. The researchers taught the robot to stand on one leg - recreating a key scene from the film in the process. Scroll down for video . The Atlas robot has already shown it can walk, jump and even drive a car . However, it's not just karate - Ian has another trick up his sleeve - software written by the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Interaction which allows him to drive a car. 'To achieve this level of maneuverability in robots, researchers at IHMC look toward nature,' the team say. 'Inspired by the speed of cheetahs, the endurance of horses, the maneuverability of monkeys, and the versatility of humans, IHMC researchers are on a quest to develop legged robots that are fast, efficient, and graceful, with the mobility required to access many of the same places that humans can.' At the US Government's Robo-Olympics, Ian came second, despite competing as a virtual software simulation. Despite his lack of limbs, the world's most innocuously named 'bot was able to walk, carry a fire hose and, most impressively, get in a car and drive it. The 'crane' stance, being held by Karate Kid Daniel LaRusso (played by Ralph Maccio left) in the 1984 film inspired the latest movements of the Atlas robot. It demonstrates strong balancing skills and composure and showcases the agility of the Google-owned machine, said the firm . Atlas is a high mobility, humanoid robot designed to negotiate outdoor, rough terrain, Boston Dynamics said. 'Atlas can walk bipedally leaving the upper limbs free to lift, carry, and manipulate the environment. In extremely challenging terrain, Atlas is strong and coordinated enough to climb using hands and feet, to pick its way through congested spaces. The researchers taught the robot the trick to show off its balance. The Atlas robot has an articulated sensor head includes stereo cameras and a laser range finder so it can 'see' where it is going. 'Articulated, sensate hands will enable Atlas to use tools designed for human use. Atlas includes 28 hydraulically-actuated degrees of freedom, two hands, arms, legs, feet and a torso. 'An articulated sensor head includes stereo cameras and a laser range finder.' Atlas is powered from an off-board, electric power supply via a flexible tether - although a new version promises to remove this.","Atlas Robot built by Boston Dyanmics- which Google bought .

"Pop star James Blunt has attacked Labour shadow minister Chris Bryant after he criticised the number of posh actors and musicians . Singer James Blunt has fired off another shot in his war of words with outspoken MP Chris Bryant – after the Labour shadow minister criticised the number of posh actors and musicians in Britain. Labour MP Chris Bryant claimed British culture was 'dominated' by stars like Blunt and Eddie Redmayne who went to expensive boarding schools. The remarks, which come in the wake of Redmayne's best actor Oscar nomination last week, sparked a furious response from Harrow-educated Blunt. The You're Beautiful star accused Mr Bryant of being a 'prejudiced wazzock' who was using the 'politics of jealousy' to win votes. Mr Bryant hit back at the pop star's online attack - criticising him for being 'so blooming precious'. But 40-year-old Blunt reignited the row this morning - taking to Twitter to accuse the Labour MP of failing to help people from ordinary backgrounds achieve success. In a message posted this morning on Blunt’s official Twitter page, he wrote: ‘To help people at the bottom of the tree join those near the top, give them a ladder, not a bow and arrow.’ The message was more restrained than his online rant yesterday, in which he accused the Labour MP of being a 'prejudiced wazzock'. In his letter to Mr Bryant, Labour's  shadow culture minister, Blunt claimed that the £30,000 a year boarding school he attended did nothing to help him break into the music industry. The  Brit award-winner also claims that people in the music industry tried to get him to change his accent so he sounded less posh. Blunt opened his letter to Mr Bryant by accusing him of being a 'classist gimp', despite the fact that the Labour MP himself was privately educated at £20,000 a year Cheltenham College before attending Oxford. In Blunt's letter, he wrote: 'I happened to go to a boarding school. No one helped me at boarding school to get into the music business.' He added: 'I bought my first guitar with money I saved from holiday jobs (sandwich packing!). I was taught the only four chords I know by a friend. 'No one at school had ANY knowledge or contacts in the music business, and I was expected to become a soldier or a lawyer or perhaps a stockbroker. So alien was it, that people laughed at the idea of me going into the music business, and certainly no one was of any use.' Blunt said even in the army, which he joined after university, he was told that trying to become a pop star was a 'mad idea'. He wrote: 'And when I left the army, going against everyone's advice, EVERYONE I met in the British music industry told me there was no way it would work for me because I was too posh. One record company even asked if I could speak in a different accent. (I told them I could try Russian). 'Every step of the way, my background has been AGAINST me succeeding in the music business. And when I have managed to break through, I was STILL scoffed at for being too posh for the industry.' The 40-year-old Blunt reignited the row this morning - taking to Twitter to accuse Labour MP Chris Bryant of failing to help people from ordinary backgrounds achieve success. Labour MP Chris Bryant  (left)- privately educated himself - claimed British culture was 'dominated by Eddie Redmayne (right) and James Blunt and their ilk' who went to expensive boarding schools . He added: 'You come along, looking for votes, telling working class people that posh people like me don't deserve it, and that we must redress the balance. 'But it is your populist, envy-based, vote-hunting ideas which make our country crap, far more than me and my s*** songs, and my plummy accent. 'I got signed in America, where they don't give a stuff about, or even understand what you mean by me and 'my ilk', you prejudiced wazzock, and I worked my a*** off. 'What you teach is the politics of jealousy. Rather than celebrating success and figuring out how we can all exploit it further as the Americans do, you instead talk about how we can hobble that success and 'level the playing field'. 'Perhaps what you've failed to realise is that the only head-start my school gave me in the music business, where the VAST majority of people are NOT from boarding school, is to tell me that I should aim high. Perhaps it protected me from your kind of narrow-minded, self-defeating, lead-us-to-a-dead-end, remove-the-'G'-from-'GB' thinking, which is to look at others' success and say, 'it's not fair'.' Blunt signed off his letter: 'Up yours.' But Mr Bryant accused the pop star of being 'blooming precious'. In a letter in response, the MP wrote: 'I'm not knocking your success. I even contributed to it by buying one of your albums. I'm not knocking Eddie Redmayne, either. He was the best Richard II I have ever seen. 'If you'd read the whole of my interview, you'd have seen that I make the point that the people who subsidise the arts the most are artists themselves. Of course that includes you. 'But it is a statement of the blindingly obvious that that is far tougher if you come from a poor family where you have to hand over your holiday earnings to help pay the family bills.'

"Alex Matthews, 28, thought he was home and dry after the perfect romantic holiday to New York when he proposed to his girlfriend and she accepted. But after stepping off the flight home he realised something was missing: his phone which they'd used to document the entire trip, including the moment he popped the question. The couple has  launched a desperate transatlantic appeal for the Galaxy phone after, they think, it was left behind on their return flight from Newark to Birmingham. The phone contains precious photos  documenting Alex Matthews and Emma Brown's  once-in-a-lifetime trip . The phone contains precious photos and videos documenting Alex and Emma Brown's, 29, once-in-a-lifetime visit, none of which had been posted online or shared by the couple, as they were waiting until they returned home to show images to their families. Alex, an IT consultant, spent months planning the surprise trip for Emma, a research assistant. He roped in her family, friends and work colleagues to help keep the secret before he woke her up at 5am on August 21 last year and told her to pack her bags. The couple have posted their appeal on the UK's biggest online lost and found site www.Lostbox.co.uk . It wasn't until they got to the airport that Emma discovered they were going to the Big Apple. Alex told her they were going to see a Broadway show that he had promised to take her to earlier that year. The happy couple visited  famous sites including Times Square but it wasn't until they were standing on Brooklyn Bridge that Alex asked her to be his wife and she accepted. After the whirlwind long weekend they flew home from Newark airport in New Jersey. But when Alex stepped off the plane in Britain he realised he'd left his phone on the aircraft containing every single picture from the trip. The Brookyln Bridge in New York where Alex proposed to Emma on the memorable holiday . They  arrived on UA27 Newark- Birmingham and think the device could be between their seats 23b and 23a . Despite searches by cabin crew on the United Airlines flight the phone wasn't found, even though both Alex and Emma remember him having it on the plane. They had arrived on the UA27 Newark- Birmingham and still think the device could be between their seats 23b and 23a. Now, months later, they are making one last desperate appeal to anyone who might have come across it. The couple have posted their plea on the UK's biggest online lost and found site Lostbox.co.uk - which has been responsible for reuniting people with hundreds of items every month. Alex whisked Emma away to see a Broadway musical he had promised he would take her to one day . Photographs on the phone show where the loved-up couple visited during their stay, including Times Square . The lost phone is a Samsung Galaxy S4 mini in pebble blue. Such is Emma and Alex's hope it will be found they have kept the contract going. Alex has refused to block the phone, instead choosing to use an old one, in case one day the lost phone will sync with Google and the missing photos will be found. Emma from Birmingham, said: 'After Alex proposed we went back to the hotel we were staying at for a dance and a drink and I remember there was an American lady there who took more pictures of us. I gave her my email address but we never got those photos either. 'Everything is on that phone, pictures of our hands on Brooklyn Bridge after Al proposed, pictures of us with the New York skyline in the background and of us in the Brooklyn River Cafe straight afterwards. Have you seen it? 'Everything is on that phone, pictures of our hands on Brooklyn Bridge after Al proposed' 'There's video on there too. We forgot to throw the key from the padlock in the river so we filmed us doing it the next day on the water in Williamsburg. And there's another video of me looking completely overwhelmed and awestruck in Times Square, having just got off the plane. 'I don't even know how many pictures I took, I'm a picture fanatic, and we didn't even share a single one online while we there because we wanted to show everyone when we got back. 'We're still pretty confident it could be on the plane, if anyone had turned it on or off flight mode it would just automatically sync to our Google accounts. We're not bothered about the phone really - we just want the pictures.' Alex said: 'After we landed I had just stepped off the plane through the threshold and felt my pocket and thought 'oh, I haven't got my phone'. 'I turned round to go back on the plane but the steward said I couldn't go on and he would look for us. When he said it wasn't there we were sent to the baggage area and he said the cleaning staff would look for us. Alex says: 'The saddest thing  is not being able to show friends and family that helped with the planning' Alex and Emma stayed at the W Hotel in New York. They are hopeful someone will still return their phone . 'At this point we were worried but still thought it would turn up. But when we got the United Airlines desk they said it hadn't been found and the plane was turning round and heading back to New York. 'The saddest thing about it is not being able to show my mum, Emma's mum and all the friends and family that helped me with the planning. 'There was a quite funny moment because my mum was picking us up from the airport. Emma came out first looking quite sad and then I came out almost looking in tears, she thought it had all gone wrong, but luckily Emma had said yes.' Lostbox director Clare Owen said: 'We were really touched by Emma's appeal and Alex's lovely romantic idea for a proposal.

"A fellow television dad is weighing in on the numerous allegations of sexual assault  that have been leveled at Bill Cosby over the past few months. Alan Thicke, who starred in Growing Pains and was a producer on Cosby's variety show Cos back in the 70s, said in a recent interview; 'There is no doubt in my mind Bill Cosby was a bad boy.' This despite the fact that Thicke also states in the interview that he still considers Cosby a friend. Scroll down for video . Opening up: Alan Thicke (left) has said that he believes some of the allegations of sexual assault against his friend and former coworker Bill Cosby (right) are 'no doubt' true . 'When there’s that much conversation. When there’s that much smoke, there must be some fire,' Thicke told the Toronto Star. 'I’m sure that Bill must have been a bad boy. I think the issue will be to what degree.' That being said, Thicke was also quick to point out that he never once witnessed any of this behavior from Cosby. 'In my history with Bill, I saw absolutely nothing of the controversy around him now,' said Thicke. 'I just saw a guy who was doing his job.' And while he is quick to praise Cosby for all he contributed to the world of comedy, and for being 'one of the guys who really rescued the sitcom,' Thicke also says that he is not sure how to 'move forward' in his relationship with the  actor, noting that he has not spoken to him since women began coming forward last October claiming they were drugged and raped by the comedian. Cosby meanwhile is continuing his North American stand-up tour, seemingly oblivious to the protesters who have begun gathering outside his shows. That being said, the actor just suffered another major blow as a result of these allegations, with NBC revealing earlier this month that they would not be moving forward with a previously announced show featuring the actor. 'Fifteen women came out and accused him of what they accused him of,' said NBC Entertainment Chairman Bob Greenblatt. He also said it was 'safe to say' the network would never again work with Cosby in any capacity. In other recent developments, Cosby's lawyer Martin Singer announced last week that he had evidence the actor was in New York City on the night model Chloe Goins has accused him of drugging and sexually assaulting her at the Playboy Mansion.

"Babies conceived through IVF are now less likely to die in infancy, thanks to a policy of implanting just one fertilised egg back into a mother's womb. They are also less likely to be born prematurely, underweight or stillborn compared with babies born 20 years ago, scientists in Denmark have found. The strategy of transferring one egg back into the mother's womb reduces the risk of a multiple pregnancy and the complications that come as a result. The new findings back a previous study showing women receiving a single embryo are five times more likely to have a healthy baby. A policy of implanting just one fertilised egg back into the mother's womb during IVF treatment has reduced the likelihood a baby will die within its first year, scientists have found (file picture) IVF involves surgically removing an egg from the woman's ovaries and fertilising it with sperm in a laboratory. The fertilised egg, or embryo, is then placed back into the woman's womb to grow and develop. There is an increased chance of a mother conceiving twins or triplets, if more than one embryo is put back into the womb. Multiple pregnancies can be problematic, significantly increasing the risk of complications for the mother and babies. Around half of all twins, and 90 per cent of triplets are born prematurely or with a low birth weight. The risk of dying in the first week of life is also greater for twins and triplets. In the largest study of its kind to date, researchers at the University Hospital of Copenhagen investigated the health of more than 92,000 assisted reproduction (ART) babies born in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden between 1988 and 2007. Current recommendations in the UK advise the number of embryos transferred into the mother's womb during IVF should be limited to avoid the risks of multiple births. Dr Anna-Karina Henningsen, said: 'During the 20-year period of our study, we observed a remarkable decline in the risk of being born preterm or very preterm. 'The proportion of single ART babies born with a low or very low birth weight - less than 5.5lbs (2,500g) or 3.3lbs (1,500g) respectively - also decreased. IVF involves surgically removing an egg from the woman's ovaries and fertilising it with sperm in a laboratory. The fertilised egg, or embryo, is then placed back into the woman's womb to grow and develop . 'The rates for stillbirths and death during the first year declined among both singletons and twins, and fewer ART twins were stillborn or died during the first year compared with spontaneously conceived twins.' Her team analysed 62,379 singletons and 29,758 twins born after assisted reproduction and compared them with 362,215 singletons and 122,763 twins conceived naturally in the same Scandinavian countries in the same period. Dr Henningsen said: 'These data show if there is a national policy to transfer only one embryo per cycle during assisted reproduction, this not only lowers the rates of multiple pregnancies, but also has an important effect on the health of the single baby. 'Transferring several embryos in one cycle, even if it results in only a single baby, can still have a negative impact on the overall neonatal outcomes of singletons. 'By transferring only a single embryo, you not only avoid multiple births and all the health problems for the babies and mothers associated with these. 'It also results in healthier ART singletons because there are fewer instances of 'vanishing twins' or procedures to reduce the number foetuses developing after successful implantation of several in the mother's womb.' But the study, published in the journal Human Reproduction, underlined other factors that have also contributed to the steady improvement in the health of ART babies over the last two decades. Dr Henningsen said: 'We have improved both the technical skills in the laboratory and the clinical skills of the doctors and also perform milder ovarian stimulation. 'In addition, the culture media in which the embryos are first developed in the laboratory have improved in quality, as have the hormonal medications used to help women produce a sufficient number of high quality eggs at the right time.' The study carried out at the University Hospital of Copenhagen found implanting one fertilised egg back into the womb reduces the chance of twins or triplets, which increase risks for the unborn babies. Where one egg was transferred babies were less likely to be born prematurely, underweight or stillborn . From 1989 to 2002 the proportion of ART twins in the four countries remained stable at around 23 per cent, but it started to decline after that and by 2007 it was only 11.6 per cent overall. This decline was reflected in the health outcomes for ART babies with the rate for premature singletons and twins born before 37 weeks gestation more than halving in Sweden, and also dropping dramatically in the other countries. The rate of stillbirths also halved, while deaths among singletons within the first year fell by two thirds, and by almost as much among the twins. Dr Henningsen, added: 'These findings show convincingly that, while there has been a considerable increase in assisted reproduction cycles over the past 20 years, this has been accompanied by a significant improvement in health outcomes for these babies, particularly for singleton babies. 'The most important reason is the dramatic decline in multiple births due to policies of choosing to transfer only one embryo at a time.'","Implanting one egg back into the womb of mother's during IVF has reduced premature births, underweight, stillborn babies and deaths in infancy .

In the video obtained by Deadline, Rodman claims he had no idea about many of the atrocities committed by Kim Jon-un, such as the execution of Kim's uncle in a dramatic political purge that happened just before the visit. 'I didn't know that,' he says. Rodman also defended himself against criticism he received for not doing more to get political prisoner Kenneth Bae freed. 'That's not my job, you know,' he said. Though, as Deadline notes, Rodman would at one point ask Kim via Twitter 'do me a solid and let Kenneth Bae loose.'

"A JIihadi recruitment ‘poster boy’ who faked his own death to try to sneak back into the UK faces questions over his links to Jihadi John. Imran Khawaja, 27, is suspected of close ties to the Islamic State ‘executioner’ who now holds the life of two Japanese hostages in his hands. The authorities believe Khawaja could have new information about the man known as Jihadi John, one of the world’s most wanted terrorists. He spent six months among foreign fighters on the Syrian frontline last year and left just weeks before Jihadi John began his spree of hostage beheadings. Scroll down for video . Bravado: 'Poster boy' Imran Khawaja, 27, pictured posing on an ISIS video with a pair of machine guns, is suspected of close ties to the Islamic State ‘executioner’ Jihadi John . Menacing: Masked executioner Jihadi John with hostages Kenji Goto Jogo (left) and Haruna Yukawa (right) The link can be revealed for the first time after Khawaja pleaded guilty to preparing acts of terrorism and other offences. The former body builder and convicted drug dealer had appeared behind a mask in a series of graphic videos designed to entice other young men to the warzone. He was arrested at Dover last June a short time after his militant group posted a message claiming he had been killed in fighting. Unknown to him, police had identified him from the propaganda videos and his passport triggered an alert. The security services are widely believed to have identified Jihadi John but remain hungry for information about his background. They are particularly interested in his position in the IS hierarchy and who he mixed with before earning global notoriety. The two men moved in the same circles in the Islamist stronghold of Raqqa before IS began beheading Western hostages. Khawaja even posed for pictures posted online in which he wore an almost identical black hooded outfit to that worn by the killer. Jihadi John was originally given his name as one of the four ‘Beatles’, so named by foreign hostages because of their English accents. It is not known what has happened to the other three, who may have been killed in fighting or have even attempted to return home. Now that Khawaja has pleaded guilty he will be approached in Belmarsh Prison to see if he is willing to debrief the authorities on what he knows.

The terrorist, of Southall, West London, was a senior member of Rayat al-Tawheed, meaning ‘flag of unity’, which was largely made up of foreign fighters. Allied to IS, they used gold Kalashnikovs as a brand on their prolific social media output. Khawaja, who sports a large tattoo and is also known as Abu Daigham al Baritani or Abu Daigham al-Britani, appeared in many of the videos. In one, ‘Five Star Jihad’, he is introduced as ‘Abu Daigham’ and gives viewers a tour of daily life at their training camp, encouraging others to join them. In another he explains how a fellow fighter was shot through the side, but ‘thanks to Allah’s will’ was soon back on the front line. Always concealed behind a mask, he was also filmed displaying his weight-lifting skills and reading the Koran in a safe house dormitory. Khawaja was arrested at Dover last June a short time after his militant group posted a message claiming he had been killed in fighting . The 27-year-old trained at a terrorist camp with an extremist group linked to ISIS, where he was even pictured holding the severed head of a man (pictured) There is other footage of him pulling severed heads of a bag after recovering them from a battlefield. In the disturbing video he holds up one head and shows it to the camera. It is entitled ‘British ISIS fighter Abu Daigham al-Britani with Government soldier’s head Syria.’ In other photos he poses in front of tanks and heavy weaponry. Last June, a statement by extremist group Rayat al-Tahweed said Khawaja was killed ‘in a battle a few nights ago,’ adding: ‘May Allah accept him.’ In fact, the death had been faked so that he could return home to raise more money for the terrorist cause. Khawaja, oblivious to the fact the authorities knew he had travelled to Syria, was arrested as he got off a ferry at Dover the same day, using his own passport. His cousin, Tahir Bhatti, 45, from Watford, who ran a family taxi firm, was also arrested. He had agreed to collect Khawaja from Bulgaria, avoiding the well-worn jihadist route of flights to and from Turkey. Detectives believe Khawaja needed to raise funds for weapons because an associate, Asim Ali, 33, from Ealing, West London, was failing to do so. The jihadist, also known as Abu Daigham al Baritani or Abu Daigham al-Britani, now faces a lengthy jail term for his role in the Syrian conflict . Images were found on his cousin’s phone showing him sitting on a tank with an assault rifle and in other poses with weapons and a small child. Police discovered he even sent his mother a video of himself cutting the neck of a goat as practice for conducting his own beheadings. Khawaja flew to Northern Iraq on January 26, 2014, purchasing the ticket using a stolen credit card, and then crossed into Syria. By June last year, Bhatti had convinced his cousin to return to the UK saying his parents were not well and that he should come home. Khawaja admitted last month to a string of terrorism charges and the case can now be reported after both Ali and Bhatti pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey to helping him. Khawaja admitted preparing acts of terrorism by engaging in physical training, obtaining return airline tickets and withdrawing £300. The terrorist (left) will also be approached in Belmarsh Prison to see if he is willing to debrief the authorities on what he knows about the masked killer . He also admitted attending a place used for terrorist training, receiving training in the use of firearms and possessing a firearm for preparing an act of terrorism. A fifth charge of soliciting to murder another person or persons unknown and will lie on file. Khawaja - who police say is one of the most dangerous British men to return from the war-torn country - is now facing years behind bars for his role in the Syrian conflict. Khawaja plotted his escape from the war-torn country by asking his cousin Tahir Bhatti, 45 (above) to drive to Bulgaria to drive him back to the UK . Ali admitted helping a terrorist and Bhatti admitted assisting an offender by helping Khawaja return to the UK. Bhatti had previously pleaded not guilty to preparing a terrorist act by helping Khawaja; having information about terrorism, and assisting an offender. Mr Justice Baker ordered the outstanding charges be left on file. Defending, Joel Bennathan QC had argued that Bhatti 'was doing what Muslim families are meant to do - tell them to desist and come out of Syria'. But the court heard the 'road trip' was carefully orchestrated with the use of code words in messages. There was talk of being 'in a club' and needing 'clothes' because of the 'puke' and that a 'doorman' was not letting him out. The court heard how 'club' meant a camp; the 'doormen' were those running it and 'puke' related to battlefield material and that he needed new clothes. 'Mr Bhatti does not bat an eyelid at this terminology. It is known and understood,' said Mr Dawson. The court had heard that another feature of the case was the use of a communications app called Telegram - a secured and encrypted system that could not be intercepted. One message from Khawaja read, 'If you can raise a little money, nothing big, need to buy a Klash ASAP.' All three will be sentenced in February. Khawaja and Ali are in custody while Bhatti was released on conditional bail.","Imran Khawaja, 27, spent six months among foreign fighters on frontline .

"A 68-year-old Ukrainian grandmother has been nicknamed 'The Punisher' after completing a gruelling military training alongside army cadets four decades her junior. Footage from the army's training camp shows pensioner Ekaterina Bilyik rolling over snow-covered fields, leaping to her feet and firing assault rifles alongside the young men in her troop. She is now preparing to take part in the fierce fighting  that has torn eastern Ukraine apart. Scroll down for video .

An army spokesman confirmed the grandmother (pictured left) had taken part in the same military training as other cadets . Mrs Bilyik marches in formation beside military cadets who are, on average, four decades younger than her . Mrs Bilyik said she decided to sign up after watching the horrific scenes of carnage in which Russian-backed separatists violently clashed with pro-Ukraine fighters. The mother-of-three children and grandmother-to-five is from the town of Zhidaev close to city of Lviv in western Ukraine. She said: 'I have lived here all my life and we survived the Nazi occupation and the Soviets, and I believe in standing up for what's right and making sure we never see occupation again. 'I wanted to set an example, to show young people that no matter how old you are you can make a difference, and that was why I decided to sign up.' Army spokesman Nataliya Ishenko confirmed that the grandmother had taken part in the same military training as other recruits, who were on average four decades younger than her, and that she had passed all the tests and could use a gun with as much accuracy as the rest. After completing the training she says she is now ready to go to the front line. Local news website Tengrinews said the other men in her squad had given her the nickname 'The Punisher' because of the way she talked about what she was going to do the Russian-backed separatists. She said: 'We need to give them the message that Ukraine is a free country, and if they don't like it, they can go back to Russia.'

"Britain is ‘wide open to abuse’ by EU migrants looking to ‘freeload’ on our welfare system, the Foreign Secretary warned last night. Philip Hammond told MPs that a major reduction in EU immigration was needed to ‘satisfy British public opinion’ ahead of a planned in/out referendum on Europe. Mr Hammond said Britain had already tightened welfare rules in order to discourage migrants, and would take further domestic measures. But he warned that changes would also be needed at EU level. Scroll down for video . Philip Hammond told MPs that a major reduction in EU immigration was needed to ‘satisfy British public opinion’ ahead of a planned in/out referendum on Europe. He told MPs on the Commons European Scrutiny Committee: ‘We are wide open to abuse. We have tightened up some things already and there are going to be more measures that we can introduce to make it more difficult for people from the EU to abuse our system. ‘But there will be some areas where we need changes (at EU level) to change the way the EU rules work if we are to have sufficient impact on immigration levels to satisfy British public opinion. ‘And that is what we want to do – we are politicians and we are getting a very clear message from the public that this is an issue of significant concern to them.’ Mr Hammond conceded that Britain would not be allowed to opt out of the EU’s free movement rules altogether – and said that David Cameron’s negotiations would focus on ‘the art of the possible’. But he insisted that other EU countries were willing to be flexible because they are desperate to keep Britain in the EU. Sir John Major (pictured) has suggested that Euroscepticism is slowly fading in the UK . ‘I have visited 18 EU states and I am very clear that we will be able to negotiate a significant package of reform,’ he said. Earlier, Mr Hammond told the Commons: ‘Free movement to work is one of the principles of the EU. Free movement to freeload is not one of the principles of the EU, and Britain is not the only country that is affected by this problem and not the only country determined to address it.’ Mr Cameron has pledged to renegotiate Britain’s membership of the EU ahead of an in/out referendum in 2017 if the Conservatives win the General Election. Mr Hammond confirmed speculation that the referendum could be held earlier, saying he would like to see it take place ‘as soon as possible’. The Foreign Secretary has previously indicated he would vote to leave the EU if the referendum were held on Britain’s current membership terms. But on Tuesday he insisted he was open to changing his mind if the Prime Minister negotiates significant change. His intervention came as Sir John Major suggested that Euroscepticism is slowly fading in the UK. The former prime minister, who has been tipped to play a key role in the negotiations, predicts Britain will vote to stay in the EU. He told the European magazine: ‘There has always been a minority of the population who emotionally regard themselves as being British but not European. But this feeling fades with each generation. Each successive generation regards itself as more European than its predecessor.’","Philip Hammond said change needed before a planned in/out referendum on Europe .

"The more Americans think about Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney taking up residence in the White House, the less they like them, according to a poll released Tuesday. The two default Republican 2016 front-runners have seen their approval ratings tumble since they started publicly discussing their presidential bona fides. According to the Wall Street Journal/NBC poll, Romney gets positive marks from just 27 per cent of Americans and 52 per cent of Republicans. The numbers inside the GOP are down 8 points since September, long before his presidential buzz started and at a time when few observers expected him to mount a third White House campaign. Bush does even worse, with only 19 per cent of Americans saying they like him – down 7 points since November, before he launched a presidential exploratory committee. THIRD TIME'S THE CHARM? Mitt Romney has ground to make up with voters before he can count on another Republican presidential nomination . NOT YET IMPRESSIVE: Jeb Bush, a former Florida governor and the younger brother of former President George W. Bush, gets positive marks from fewer than 1 in 5 Americans . Both men are 'under water' with Americans – a polling term that describes candidates who attract more negatives than positives. Fully 40 per cent of Americans have a sour taste in their mouths over Romney, who lost to President Barack Obama in 2012. That's 13 percentage points more than the number who like him. President George W. Bush's brother is 13 points under water, with a 32 per cent negative approval rating. Much of the electorate has yet to make up its mind, the new poll shows. But inside the Republican party a battle is brewing over whether the 2016 nomination should go to an avowed conservative or a more pragmatic moderate. Both Romney and Bush fall in the moderate wing of the party – a contingent that tea party backers complain lost them the presidency in 2012 with Romney and in 2008 with Arizona Sen. John McCain. DISTANCE: Jeb stumped for Mitt in 2012, but the two will likely go head-to-head this year for the hearts and minds of Republican centrists . They point back as far as then-Sen.Bob Dole's crushing 1996 loss to President Bill Clinton as evidence that Americans will only elect a Republican whose positions are full-throated and unapologetically conservative. By that measure, Bush is far behind Romney. Bush wins positive thoughts from a scant 30 per cent of self-described conservatives, compared to 45 per cent for Romney. Ultimately, hard-line right-wingers will likely break for other candidates. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, for instance, will work to lock up support from tea partiers after he announces his White House bid. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul is expected to make a pitch that's attractive to libertarian-leaning conservatives who are angered by what they see as over-reaching government surveillance. And Marco Rubio, the junior senator from Florida, could be attractive to Hispanic Americans and those who see Obama's new Cuba policy as a moral failing. NOT LIKE W: Jeb is seen as less conservative than his older brother, former president George W. Bush (pictured) If Bush or Romney strays too far to the center, an Iowa political consultant told DailyMail.com on Tuesday, their conpetitors open arms will be waiting. 'These guys have to walk a fine line,' said the adviser, who is working for an undeclared but likely GOP 2016 hopeful. 'All it takes is one speech where you sound too much like the president, and you're no longer the flavor of the month.' 'Remember that it's the conservative activists, and all their enthusiasm, that drives the primary process. Moderates come out to vote, but they tend to wait to see who gets nominated before they take the time to care a lot.' He spoke on condition of anonymity, he said, in order to protect his future business prospects. Romney and Bush may soon both prove him right. On Monday night in Indian Wells, California, Romney told an audience of supporters that he favors an increased minimum wage and is warming to the idea of man-made climate change. His evolving climate views could expose him to charges of flip-flopping. In late 2011 he told voters that 'we don't know what’s causing climate change on this planet. And the idea of spending trillions and trillions of dollars to try to reduce CO2 emissions is not the right course for us.' GLORY DAYS: In 2012 Romney, shown with running mate Rep Paul Ryan (left), was Republicans' best hope to unseat Obama -- but now he's treading water . The mega-millionaire also embraced an Obama-esque theme of income inequality on Monday night, saying: 'I don't like the fact that middle America feels they can't get ahead' economically. Bush's problems with the GOP's right wing stem from his backing of the federal government's 'Common Core' national education standards and his liberal-leaning position on immigration reform . Most conservatives believe states and counties, not the feds, should set education policy. And Obama's move to mainstream millions of illegal immigrants with residency cards and work permits is increasingly unpopular. A Washington Post/ABC News poll published Monday found that 57 per cent of registered voters in the U.S. think the plan, which side-steps Congress and relies on hotly disputed executive authority, should be blocked on Capitol Hill.","Romney, the 2012 GOP nominee, gets positive marks from just 27 per cent of Americans and 52 per cent of Republicans .

"A Spanish court has jailed a German property developer for defrauding seven British families out of more than half a million pounds for homes that were never built. German Heinz Wilfert was sentenced to six years in prison at the hearing in Alicante for conning clients by lying to them he had the go-ahead to build the houses to get his hands on their cash. One of the British couples he cheated, had paid him more than £100,000 for a house near Benidorm, a court heard. Judges trying Wilfert ruled he knew it was 'highly improbable' building work could even start when he made his written promise to the expats he hoodwinked. They concluded that Wilfert had acted the way he did 'to enrich himself with the money the buyers paid him.' They were planning on retiring to the inland village of Sagra near the Costa Blanca resort of Benidorm. The houses, on an estate that was to be called Oasis Verde - Green Oasis in Spanish - were never built. The court acquitted two men who subsequently bought Wilfert's firm off him including the owner of the land the homes were planned for. Spaniard Miguel Muntaner offered the German's victims alternative homes nearby for extra cash but they declined his offer. In a written ruling released today,, judges said there was no evidence Muntaner and an associate knew about the fraud as the victims themselves had admitted the only person they dealt with was Wilfert.","German property developer defrauded British families out of £500,000 .

His wife said: 'Despite what he said in the description he is a good dad and loves his children - well at least he makes out he does! 'He is like any other parent - quite tired all the time, but we wouldn't have it any other way.' The couple's children are aged seven, six and four and are now too old for the buggy, which was 'taking up room in the garage', she said. So Mr Andresier, a dealer development manager for the charity Motability, placed the item on the auction site last night and immediately became an online sensation. 'This buggy was purchased against my wishes many years ago as I never wanted any children,' he wrote under the name ukjoel25. 'I have bought cars that cost less than this buggy. My dad once bought a house that cost less than this buggy. 'During its lifetime its had pretty much every bodily fluid known to science, and several that have yet to be discovered, chucked over it by my children. 'It's also absorbed its own weight in Ellas Kitchen meals and mud.' Messy: Seller Joel Andresier, 39, joked the buggy had seen contact with every bodily fluid known to science . 'I have bought cars that cost less than this buggy', he wrote. 'My dad once bought a house that cost less' Photographs on the auction site show the buggy is indeed well-used and stained with dirt - but the seller insisted any parents who claim to have immaculate prams are 'liars and scoundrels'. The item is pick-up only from the seller's detached house in Southampton, and there has been no shortage of offers. Some have genuinely asked about the item's condition or part exchanges, while others have triggered witty ripostes in their attempt to troll Joel. 'If as stated you didn't want children then why did you proceed to impregnate your wife a second and third time?', asked one potential buyer. 'Because my wife's rather yummy and I find her irresistible,' he replied. 'Will this vehicle safely transport a pinball machine?' asked another user. Joel wrote: 'To be fair it never used to safely transport my children, but I learnt that with enough gaffer tape and cable ties it can do pretty much anything.' Mr Andresier's wife Susan also laughed off the publicity. 'We bought the buggy when we had our second child so it's not like I trapped him into having ten children,' she said. Happy family: Mrs Andresier, a vet, and the couple's Labrador - both of whom feature in the advert . 'When you first meet Joel he comes across as quiet person, but  he has a very dry sense of humour,' she said . 'When you first meet Joel he comes across as quiet person, but once you get to know him you realise that he has a very dry sense of humour. 'He often writes funny things and they always make me laugh. 'I didn't know that he was going to advertise the pushchair on eBay and it is only when a friend alerted me to it that I saw how popular the post was. 'I didn't think much of the advert. I just thought it was Joel being his usual funny self. Joel is bemused by the whole thing and just thinks it's a bit of a laugh.' She added: 'It would be lovely to have that money but we know we're not going to get it so its not worth thinking about it. All I want is it for to be out of my garage to create a bit more space.' Even if Mr Andresier receives the promised sum for his buggy it won't be the most unusual sale on eBay - or the most profitable for a small item. Description: The listing on eBay was quickly shared on Twitter and picked up joke bids topping £150,000 . Sense of humour: It didn't stop with the listing - the father answered several questions from his new fans . Last year a dress made entirely from loom bands by 42-year-old Helen Smith, from Prestatyn, North Wales, sold for a reputed £170,000 after attracting more than 100 bids. And a decade ago a toasted cheese sandwich said to bear an image of the Virgin Mary sold for £18,000 to online casino goldenpalace.com. It must have been worth its weight in gold; it was already a decade old by the time of the sale, and its owner claimed it had never gone mouldy. But the danger of fake bids always looms large on the auction site. One of the drills used to bore the Channel Tunnel fetched bids of £5million when it was auctioned for charity in 2004 - only for the final selling price to be a more modest £39,999. Here we have for sale the green monster that can only be Phil and Teds. I shall be glad to see it leave my premises and never return. This was purchased against my wishes many years ago as I never wanted any children and a buggy signified my wife's intent to have children. We argued much and this buggy signifies everything that ended my happy carefree low cost child free life. This buggy clearly meant she intended to have not just one but multiple children and the extortionate price of this buggy will stay imprinted on my brain till the day I die. I have bought cars that cost less than this buggy. My dad once bought a house that cost less than this buggy. Anyway as you can tell I hate the buggy. I now have three children, and a Labrador and am forced to endure the school run where women I don't know try and discuss the price of Center Parcs holidays, and the benefits of the micro over the mini micro scooter. To summarise my life is over and this green albatross needs to go round some other poor sod's neck. On the positive none of my three children were stupidly fat, but it's been driven by my wife a lot so not all good. During its lifetime it's had pretty much every bodily fluid known to science, and several that have yet to be discovered, chucked over it by my children. It's also absorbed its own weight in Ellas Kitchen meals and mud. I have tried to maintain this item as best I could and the wheels were filled with green slime to prevent punctures, and WD40 has been used with gusto on the relevant parts. It even comes with what I lovingly refer to as the Cinderella attachment for the second child you have but don't love as much as the first. It means they can sit but cant see anything, and have a ride that's about as comfortable as a Ford Model T. All of my children are now walking (often in completely the wrong direction) but someone else deserves to give this a good home. Over the years I have collected spare bits from other zombified fathers who were once full of life and I will throw these in as well. According to the other half she has the baby carry item that came with this and the pannier bags (whatever they are) but she never used them and they are immaculate and will be listed when she conquers her fear of heights and gets into the loft. This buggy has never been used for dog sledding, racing, or buggy bumper cars, although I once used it to concuss a randy Alsatian that tried getting amorous with my lab. There are many adverts on here for immaculate models and these people are all liars and scoundrels as nothing that comes into contact with a young child is ever immaculate. So for a starting price of just £9.99 you too can screw up your life. There are programs for those of you who need to recover from drugs or alcohol. Any money generated from this sale will be used to help me recover from children (and probably involve drugs and alchohol) So spend big - its for a good cause.","Seller Joel Andresier, 39, from Southampton, 'never wanted children'

"A builder in India died after he strayed too close to a friend's camel, which bit him on the head. Govind Trivedi, 45, was pronounced dead at the scene of the attack in the city of Ahmedabad, in Gujarat province, on Sunday. Phoola Mena, who had been tasked with guarding the camel, was also injured when he was bitten on the leg while trying to free Mr Trivedi. Govind Trivedi, 45,  died at the scene in Ahmedabad, Gujarat province, after the camel bit his head, while Phoola Mena, who had been tasked with guarding the animal, was bitten on the leg (stock image) According to witnesses, the accident happened late at night on Sunday, while the camel was tied up next to a market road into the Bapunagar district. Police say they are investigating the camel's owner, Lalisinh Rajput, to see if there had been any negligence on his part. According to the Times of India, Mr Rajput used to tie his animal up next to the main road while he went to a nearby market. Mr Mena was paid to take care of the animal, but had been asleep when Mr Trivedi arrived. Kalidas Waghela, who lives in a hut close to the path, described Mr Trivedi as an alcoholic who used to come and visit his home. He added: 'On Sunday night, Trivedi strayed near the camel on his way home. The camel got irritated and attacked Trivedi; fixing its jaws on Trivedi's head.' Witnesses said the attack happened late a night on a market road in Ahmedabad (file image). Locals said Mr Trivedi, a builder, had been walking along when he strayed too close to the creature and it attacked . His cries woke up locals and Mr Mena, but by the time they rushed to help, it was already too late. Mr Mena accused villagers of beating him after the camel finally let go of Mr Trivedi, and police took him to hospital for his injuries. A police spokesman said they had recorded a verdict of accidental death. Officials have not yet decided whether to charge Mr Rajput with neglect.","Govind Trivedi, 45, strayed too close to the animal and it attacked .

"A two-year-old boy has been killed after he was struck by a train while walking a dog alone along a railway track near his home in Kentucky. The youngster, who has been named as Trayton Joiner, was struck by the train after wandering onto a level crossing with the pet in Hopkinsville. It is believed that the train driver saw the dog first, and then the child, but couldn't brake in time and the train hit both the boy and the animal. Two-year-old Trayton Joiner is believed to have been struck by a train while walking alone with a dog near to this level crossing in Hopkinsville, Kentucky . The two-year-old was rushed to the Jennie Stuart Medical Centre but was pronounced dead shortly after arrival. Police spokesman Paul Ray said that the emergency services were called by the train's driver. He added that officers were forced to go door-to-door to find the child's home. They eventually found the boy's mother, who was taken to hospital to see her son. Police are still trying to determine why the boy was by himself and believe he may have been following the dog. Mr Ray told WSMV: 'We don't know if the dog was leading the boy or vice versa, but the conductor tried to stop and did everything he could to stop.' It is not clear if the dog belonged to the boy's family. The two-year-old was taken to the Jennie Stuart Medical Centre in Kentucky, pictured, but later died from his injuries . The train, which had two locomotives and was pulling 106 empty coal cars, was travelling from Nashville, Tennesse to Madisonville, Kentucky. Rob Doolittle, a spokesman for the train operator CSX Corp, said: It's a tragic situation and our sympathies are with the family involved.' Meanwhile the dog, a female pit-bull mix which was also struck was taken to Skyline Animal Clinic in Hopkinsville. According to staff there, the animal is expected to survive.","Trayton Joiner, aged 2, was walking alone with a dog along a railway track .

"Stripped down to his underwear in the bitter cold, this man risks his life trying to rescue his dog from a frozen river. Moments later, as he inched along the ice on his hands and knees, he fell into the water – yet fortunately, both dog and owner clambered out unscathed and continued their walk. Paul Wenborne, who took the photograph while walking his own dog by the River Stour in Essex yesterday, described the unidentified man's behaviour as a 'foolish act of bravery'.

Mr Wenborne, 52, of Rayleigh, Essex, . added: 'I was with two friends and we couldn't believe what we were . seeing. He stripped down to his pants and started crawling across the . ice.' But Essex fire service condemned the man's rescue attempt as 'extremely dangerous'. Assistant divisional officer Stuart .

Not safe: Essex fire service condemned the man's rescue attempt as 'extremely dangerous' 'Dogs will normally make it safely off the ice and back to the shore. The same cannot be said for people.' The ice remained across much of the country this weekend, with the mercury dipping as low as -15.6C in Holbeach, Lincolnshire.

But an exceptionally dry 2011, . followed by what is shaping up to be the driest winter on record, has . left the reservoirs low and rivers parched. Incredibly, several counties . are officially in drought already, and experts say that if the heavens . don't open soon, the problem will get worse. While 2011 was Scotland's wettest . year on record, parts of England saw very low rainfall. East Anglia had . its second driest year and the Midlands its third driest. The situation hasn't improved in 2012 . so far, with below average rainfall in the Midlands, East Anglia and . the South East in January. Ian Barker, the Environment Agency's . head of water, land and biodiversity, said: 'It has been an . exceptionally dry winter and that has left us with very dry soils. 'It would take an average month's . rain to saturate the soil before we then begin to see rainfall percolate . down to the water table and bring groundwater levels up.'

Mr Barker said the next few months will be 'critical' to stop the drought spreading further and hosepipe bans coming in.

He added: 'It is a difficult enough job for firefighters and often ends in human tragedy if owners go on to the ice themselves. 'We are grateful the owners were thinking sensibly and had the presence of mind to stay on the bank and call for help.' Britain could be facing a severe drought this summer after the driest winter on record, experts have warned. Without heavy rainfall in the near future, extreme water shortages could hit many parts of the country - with parched landscapes, rivers drying up and possible hosepipe bans in the summer. It could have a huge knock-on effect for farmers, food production, tourism and local wildlife. Officials from the Environment Agency say the worst affected areas would include the Midlands, East Anglia and the south-east of England. Ian Baker, head of water, land and biodiversity at the Agency, said: 'The last five months in East Anglia have been the driest period since records began in 1910. 'The next few months are critical in terms of refilling ground water. It is certainly something to worry about.' Much of Europe continues to be gripped by the big freeze, with up to 50cm falling in some places. Nine people have been killed in Kosovo when an avalanche hit the village of Restelica in south of the country, officials said on Sunday - adding to the 500 plus people killed in the snow and bitter cold across the continent in the past two weeks. In Montenegro, a state of emergency has been declared following the worst snow fall in more than half a century - leaving hundreds of villages cut off. But Paul Knightley, forecaster for . MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press Association, said the cold . spell is coming to an end in Britain - although it could take some time. He said: 'We are coming to the end of . the cold spell. It's going to be a slow process, it's not going to . suddenly be massively mild. 'Some places will see a dramatic . change in temperature but it may not be something people necessarily . notice because they have been so low.' He . said cloud spreading down the country from the north would bring a rise . in temperature and some patchy drizzle and light snow in some parts. 'The snow itself is not going to be near . the amounts we have seen but there will be some drizzle which will fall . on to very cold ground so we will see the risk of some ice, especially . in untreated areas', he added.

"A group of fishermen got quite a shock when they pulled a terrifying prehistoric shark from the water near Lakes Entrance in Victoria's east. The dark brown, eel-like looking creature is a frilled shark, also known as the 'living fossil', and was named for its six pairs of frill-like gills along with its dorsal fins, similar to the predatory fish. The shark's origin dates back 80 million years and is only one of two species still alive from this period. Scroll down for video . The dark brown, eel-like looking creature is a frilled shark, also known as the 'living fossil' South East Trawl Fishing Association (SETFA) chief executive Simon Boag told the ABC the men who found the shark were puzzled by their find. 'It has 300 teeth over 25 rows, so once you're in that mouth, you're not coming out,' he said. 'Good for dentists, but it is a freaky thing. I don't think you would want to show it to little children before they went to bed.' Mr Boag said this was the first sighting of the species alive by humans. Its origins date back to 80 million years and gets its name from its six frill-like gills . 'It does look 80 million years old. It looks prehistoric, it looks like it's from another time,' he said. The shark that was pulled from the water was two metres long and caught at 700 metres. Usually the species is found deeper at 1,500 metres but it rare to find them below 1,200 metres, according to the SETFA website. It was pulled from the water by fishermen near Lakes Entrance - in the eastern part of Victoria . The shark has a dorsal, pelvic and anal fins towards the back end of its body. Its long and flexible jaw means it can ingest its prey whole while its teeth clamps down and keeps its food from escaping its clutches. The specimen was offered to the CSIRO but was not taken in. It is understood the shark has been sold off, the ABC reported.","The frilled shark was pulled from the water near Lakes Entrance, Victoria .

He said: 'I could not deny myself the opportunity to interact with such a beautiful sea snake. 'I repeatedly dove down and managed to free the snake from the intertwined coral head he had taken refuge in and managed to do it without being bitten.

"This is Australia's biggest single leaf and it's so large it can even support the weight of a small adult. The giant Amazon water lily, which spans almost two metres, was grown in a nursery at Yarra Junction, north-east of Melbourne. Geoff Cochrane, the owner of Blue Lotus Water Garden, is the man behind  the giant leaf and admits he  was 'chuffed' to find out his lily was the biggest in the country. Geoff Cochrane, the owner of Blue Lotus Water Garden in Melbourne, has grown a giant water lily that spans almost two metres in width . 'The biggest ever grown in Adelaide was 1.65 metres, so we've just exceeded that, which we're quite chuffed about,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'It's a six month process to get them up to that size. This is largest we've gotten to grow them because I'm feeding them more heavily.' The leaf Mr Cochrane has grown has reached 1.7 metres. It's so big his two grandchildren can even sit on top of the giant lily in water without sinking. The leaf is so big it can even hold Mr Cochrane's five-year-old granddaughter Kimberely without sinking . The biggest ever grown in Adelaide was 1.65 metres, but Mr Cochrane's measures 1.7 metres . Mr Cochrane said it's a six month process to get the giant leaves up to that size . He said it all starts from a seed the size of a pea. 'The seed is sown in August and it forms a seedling by September. They're then planted in the heated pond and then by Christmas they are that large,' he said. 'It's remarkable that small pea eventually turns into that gigantic lily.' He feeds the leaf a third of a bucket of fertiliser every three weeks. 'They feed like crazy,' Mr Cochrane said. 'They have a big structure underneath, they can support quite a weight... about 50kg. The seed is sown in August and it forms a seedling by September. They're then planted in the heated pond and then by Christmas they are that large .

"A bizarre Russian Roulette-style game in which players take turns drawing cards from a deck of cards featuring exploding kittens, weaponized enchiladas and back hair has received almost $2million in funding. The game, a brainchild of Matthew Inman, the creator of the cult comic Oatmeal, gathered the funding via its Kickstarter page within only a few hours after being launched. Originally called Bomb Squad, it wasn't until Mr Inman became involved that the game truly found its quirky appeal. The Exploding Kittens card game has proved hugely popular, with players claiming its Russian Roulette-style suspense is extremely addictive . The Exploding Kittens Kickstarter page (pictured) shows it has almost received $2million in funding within days of being launched . As the creators' explain: 'Exploding Kittens is a highly strategic kitty-powered version of Russian Roulette. Players take turns drawing cards until someone draws an exploding kitten and loses the game. 'The deck is made up of cards that let you avoid exploding by peeking at cards before you draw, forcing your opponent to draw multiple cards, or shuffling the deck. 'So if you're into card games or laser beams or weaponized enchiladas, please help us make this game a reality.' The Kickstarter, launched with the modest goal of attracting $10,000, surpassed even its creators' wildest expectations when it hit $1,734,000. Created by Mr Inman, Elan Lee and Shane Small, the game's appeal lies in its suspense as it edges closer to completion and the chances of drawing an exploding kitten card increase. Mr Inman told The Washington Post: 'I've wanted to make a card game for a long time, I just don’t know how to make one with great mechanics and replay value, and Elan and Shane created something really fantastic. 'I suggested that we change the name to Exploding Kittens, and add cards like unicorn pigs and Sasquatches and weaponized back-hair and a bunch of other weird Oatmeal-inspired attack cards. 'From there, our little game was born.' It's not the first time Mr Inman has created a stir among fans for his outrageous ideas. In 2012 after being served with papers for a $20,000 lawsuit filed by rival website 'FunnyJunk', he decided to ignore the legal wheels and produce his own response. After being served with a $20,000 lawsuit in 2012, Exploding Kittens creator Matthew Inman raised the money, photographed himself with it (pictured) and gave it to charity rather than pay the claimaints . He said: 'I'm going to try and raise $20,000 in donations. I'm going to take a photo of the raised money. 'I'm going to mail you that photo, along with this drawing of your mom seducing a Kodiak bear. I'm going to take the money and donate one half to the National Wildlife Federation and the other half to the American Cancer Society.' He later made good on his claim, posting a selfie of himself next to a stack of $20,000 in cash. Mr Inman's cartoons have made him extremely popular across the internet, with examples of his work such as '10 Words You Need To stop Misspelling' and 'What It's Like To Own An Apple Product' being shared widely on social media such as Facebook and Twitter.","Card game based on 'exploding kittens' premise becomes a sensation .

"This is the terrifying moment a motorist reached 208mph in his Lamborghini before crashing into a ditch - and miraculously walked away unscathed. The reckless driver took a friend for a spin on the motorway in the brand new £186,000 Lamborghini Huracan. Footage taken on the passenger's mobile phone shows the Italian supercar's V10 engine roaring as it reaches a staggering 336kph (208mph). The camera recording the speedster then begins shaking as the vehicle begins to flip . The £186,000 sports car was completely written off after it burst into flames following the crash . Police in Hungary released the footage to act as a warning stopping other motorists from speeding . But as the driver heads towards the red line of the rev counter, he loses control of the bright green Lamborghini and screams are heard inside the car. He then clips a railing before crossing the road and ending up in a ditch. At this point the Lamborghini caught fire and was burnt beyond recognition. Incredibly, the driver walked away from the wreck, rescuing his injured friend from the car who spent eight days in hospital. The crash took place on the M7 motorway in Hungary in September, with police releasing footage and images from the incident as a warning to motorists. Police have charged the driver with numerous offences. The motorist was driving a Lamborghini Huracan similar to the one pictured, which are valued at £186,000 . Debris from the green Lamborghini is left scattered along the side of the motorway in Hungary . The protective metal barrier at the road edge is left mangled after the Lamborghini crashed through it .

"If even the sight of a slithering snake makes your body contort into painful angles you may want to look away now, as a two-metre Eastern brown snake, believed to be the largest one ever caught in Australia, has been picked up in a suburban backyard. The reptile, which has been dubbed the largest of it's kind in the world, was caught by the Australian Reptile Park on the Central Coast in NSW, after being found in a nearby garden. The snake, which has been named Gigantor due to it's massive length and weight, is almost triple the weight of an average Eastern brown snake, weighing in at 2kg. Gigantor, a deadly Australian Eastern brown snake, is prepared to be measured  and milked for it's venom by handlers Tim Faulkner and Billy Collett . The photo on the left shows an average Eastern brown snake compared to Gigantor on the right . The average Eastern brown snake is 1.5metres long and weighs 700g. Gigantor's venom yield is said to yield an insane 30mg per milking, compared to a normal Eastern brown which produces 11-12mg. Giagantor is the biggest Eastern brown ever seen at the Australian Reptile Park and will play an important part in the park's life-saving venom milking program. While the park was unable to confirm whether Gigantor was the largest Eastern brown to have ever been caught in Australia, the Australian Museum say the largest Eastern brown snake  reliably measured and recorded had a total length of 1.8 metres. However it is believed that they can grow up to 2.4 metres in length. The Eastern brown snake is 2 metres long. The average Eastern brown snake is 1.5 metres . Gigantor weighs 2kg and is the biggest Eastern brown snake the park has ever seen . The museum said the snakes 'seem to prefer open landscapes such as woodlands, scrublands, and savannah grassland,' They said they are frequently found in many large towns and cities. The park's general manager, Tim Faulkner urged caution at this time of year, claiming brown snakes thrive in the type of weather we have been experiencing in Sydney. 'He's well over the average size of an average Eastern brown, with twice the girth – that's one big snake' Tim said. Gigantor was found in a suburban backyard and was caught by the Australian Reptile Park rangers . Eastern brown snakes are attracted to the wet and humid conditions being experienced in Sydney . 'It's the height of summer – a humid summer – which snakes love. Mix that with the rain we're experiencing and you're more likely to see them out and about' he said. Around 3,000 people are bitten by snakes in Australia each year, mainly in regional areas. Brown snakes account for three quarters (76%) of all snake bites, tiger snakes account for 18% of all bites and black snakes account for 6% of cases. Eastern brown snakes are the second deadliest in Australia after the Inland taipan.Their fangs are very small (about 3mm long), but their venom contains potent neurotoxins and pro-coagulants, which cause progressive paralysis and incoagulable blood. Eastern brown snakes are commonly found in mainland Australia and are the most common cause of snake bite deaths in Australia. They can vary from very pale brown to reddish or almost black in colour . More than 200 snakes are 'milked' fortnightly to provide venom to companies who then produce snake anti-venom .

More than 200 snakes are 'milked' fortnightly to provide venom to companies who then produce snake anti-venom. The Australian Reptile Park is home to wombats, platypus, Tasmanian devil's, echidnas, dingoes and some of Australia 's largest reptiles. It is the only zoo in Australia committed to saving lives with a venom-milking program in place for the past 50 years. Billy Collett from the Australian Reptile park said Gigantor is the biggest Eastern brown snake they've had at the reptile park and he’s an 'absolute asset to the venom programme' the Eastern brown snake will now help with a venom program at the park . Billy Collett from the Australian Reptile park said Gigantor is the biggest Eastern brown snake they've had at the reptile park and he’s an 'absolute asset to the venom programme'. 'The Eastern brown snake has become more and more common in the urban areas because people populations are exploding, which brings lots of rodents, which also brings snakes,' Billy said. 'We've got snakes out and about again at the moment, we've just had a week of rain here in Sydney and now things are warming up again the snakes are hatching and some snakes are also feeding up because the winter months are only a few months away.' he said. Park keeper Billy holds up Gigantor to emphasis his length and weight . The keepers tried to contain the gigantic reptile . A brown snake gave swimmers and sunbathers on a NSW north coast beach a bit of a scare last week when it came slithering out of the surf between the red and yellow flags at One Mile beach.. When lifeguards started blowing on their whistles to evacuate people out of the water, beach goers initially thought the snake was a shark. But as it swam closer to the shore it soon became clear it was a 1.5-metre brown snake, the Great Lakes Advocate reported. Still amazed at his size and weight, the keepers said they had never seen an Eastern brown snake that big . The snake, which has been named Gigantor due to it's massive length and weight, is almost triple the weight of an average Eastern brown snake, weighing in at 2kg . Great Lakes  supervisor for lifeguards Simon Lee told Daily Mail Australia in the 20 years he had been with the Surf Life Saving organisation he had not seen anything like it before. He has been a lifeguard for the last six years. Mr Lee said the snake was just metres from the shore, which was 'very unusual for the snake'. 'I've never seen a snake rock up like that,' he said. The average Eastern brown snake is 1.5metres long and weighs 700g. Gigantor's venom yield is said to yield an insane 30mg per milking, compared to a normal Eastern brown which produces 11-12mg .

"A dark cave thousands of feet up the side of a remote mountain in the Philippines is the final resting place of these curious corpses known as 'fire mummies'. The Ibaloi people, an ancient race from the Philippines, smoked their dead dry for months to mummify them - giving them their firey nickname. The preserved remains lie in dark caverns 4,000ft up the side of Mount Timbac, near Kabayan in the province of Benguet, 200 miles north of capital Manila. Scroll down for video . Creepy: Some of the Ibaloi fire mummies of the Philippines, which were smoked dry for months to preserve them before being locked away in their mountain resting place for as long as 1,000 years . Necropolis: Hundreds of skulls are piled up in the cave up the side of a mountain 200 miles north of Manila . Protected: Some of the corpses have been transferred to wooden boxes, presumably to protect them . Some of them have been locked away for more than 1,000 years. The Ibaloi's burial practice endured until the arrival of Spanish colonisers four hundred years ago and the mummy caves themselves remained untouched until the 19th century. Although only a handful of the mountainside Ibaloi tombs are open to the public, many have become the target of vandals and looters in recent years. It is believed only a few Ibaloi elders know the specific locations of the 80 sacred caves. They are said to perform ancient rituals at the tombs to this day.

Right, Mr Zeta-Yep looks at the entrance to the cave . Edgar Alan Zeta-Yep, 31, from the Philippines, hiked up Mount Timbac to see the ancient mummies. His visit came two decades after Edgar first saw one of the mummies at a Bangoiu City museum. Mr Zeta-Yep, who has been a travel photographer for seven years, told Mercury Press: 'I have always been fascinated by them. 'It was a spooky and enlightening experience crouched inside a small and damp rock shelter to admire and photograph the mummies really up close.' Mr Zeta-Yep used a DSLR camera on a portable tripod to take the shots with a long exposure, to capture the detail inside the dark caves. He said: 'After murmuring prayers, our Ibaloi guide lifted the covers. They were lying inside wooden coffins in a fetal position, some with hands over their faces as if to shield the light from our torches. 'The mummies were so well-preserved, we could even see the linear tattoos preserved on their arms and legs.'","The ancient Ibaloi people smoked their dead for months to preserve them .

"The wink is back - and so is the leadership speculation. Last year Prime Minister Tony Abbott copped a battering after famously winking at an ABC radio presenter while talking to a sex worker and now he has done it again. In an interview where a Liberal voter laid into him on Melbourne's 3AW this morning, Mr Abbott was pictured reviving the facial twitch that got him into so much trouble.

More significantly, he was forced to hose down speculation that he might not lead his party to the next election as he is so unpopular. 'That's nonsense, absolute nonsense,' he said, after he was quizzed about whether his government was in strife. He said one lesson learned from the previous Labor government - racked by leadership tensions - is that you rally behind someone and do not change leaders.

"A 4.2-metre crocodile has been put down after it pounced at two visitors walking along a highway in Kakadu National Park. The monster creature attacked the walkers - who were near a waterway - on Arnhem Highway, about 30 kilometres from Jabiru, in the Northern Territory about 10am on Tuesday. Following the incident, it was killed and then rangers fished it out of the water with a tractor. The monster creature is thought to have attacked the walkers - who were near a waterway - on Arnhem Highway in the Northern Territory . A Parks Australia spokeswoman said in a statement to Daily Mail Australia the two people were making their way through long grass near a culvert when the crocodile 'lunged' at them. Fortunately, they were able to get away uninjured and went to report the incident to rangers. The spokeswoman said the pair were 'a bit shaken up'. 'Our rangers headed straight out to the scene, and they could clearly see large croc tracks in the grass, heading into the water, but no sign of the croc,' the spokeswoman said. The rangers then returned to the site under the cover of night to try and spot the animal when its eyes reflected the search lights. 'They quickly located a crocodile fitting the description, a 4.2-metre croc that was missing a portion of its tail and appeared underweight,' the spokeswoman said. The two people were walking in Kakadu National Park (above) when the crocodile 'lunged' at them . 'The animal was shot and removed in the interest of public safety. 'We never take this decision lightly, but public safety is paramount.' NT Parks and Wildlife Commission's Tommy Nichols told the ABC waterways in Kakadu ran into major river systems and people had to be on alert in case a crocodile appeared. The senior ranger for crocodile management estimated the crocodile to be at least 16 years old because it was four metres in size. This comes after a horror year in crocodile attacks in the Top End. Last year, the Northern Territory had its highest number of crocodile-related deaths on record. Following the incident, it was killed when rangers fished it out of the water at this culvert with a tractor . The pair were 60 kilometres from Jabiru while on the Arnhem Highway in the Northern Territory . Saltwater crocodiles killed four Territorians last year, which is almost one-fifth of the total 21 people killed since 1974. In January 2014, a 12-year-old boy was snatched by a croc while swimming with friends at a billabong in Kakadu on Australia Day. Six months later, while washing out a bucket off the back of his boat, a 62-year-old man was killed on the South Alligator River in Kakadu . In August of the same year on the Tiwi Islands, a 22-year-old man's remains were found by police in the stomach of a crocodile that was shot a short time later. Then Tran Van Lanh, 57, waded into the Adelaide River to unsnag a fishing line and was fatally attacked by a rare, well-known albino-headed crocodile called Michael Jackson as his wife witnessed in horror.","Crocodile attacked two people who were walking in the Northern Territory .

"This video shows the moment a living horse was held down and chopped up by a mob at a bullfight who saw the chance to get fresh horse meat in an incident described as 'disgusting'. The horse had been knocked over and injured after being attacked by a bull during a recent traditional bullfight in the town of Buenavista, in northern Colombia. The enraged ball had run off after injuring the horse, which was then surrounded by the crowd and held down. Scroll down for video . Shocking: A mob butchered a live horse for its meat after it had been gorged by a bull . The animal is mercilessly set upon by a crowd, who have no regard for its suffering . Some of the members of the crowd then start cutting chunks of meat off of the horse which according to the video still appears to be moving and alive. Animal-rights activists Batman Camargo, who is a local campaigner against bullfights, said: 'This is something that should not go unpunished because we have evidence that the meat which was cut off the horse was on sale hours later in local butchers.' He added: 'If we allow this to go unpunished, then people with knives looking for something to eat might well become a regular happening at bullfights.' But lawyer Jose Gregorio Beltran says the attackers had not broken any law and could only be punished if the owner of the horse made a complaint about damage to his property. And he added that it would almost certainly not result in a prison sentence. As soon as the horse falls over, a mob quickly swarms around it, with the animal unable to stand up . Outrage: Andreea Padilla (left), spokeswoman for animal rights group AnimaNaturalis, said the mayor who organised the event 'knows how serious the incident was', while Julio Cesar Guerra (right), governor of the region where the bullfight took place, has condemned the slaughter of the horse . Quintiliano Tapi, mayor of Buenavista, who organised the bullfight claims that he wasn't in attendance . However the owner of the horse is believed to be an enthusiastic supporter of bullfights who was there on the animal to take part in the event, and has refused to complain. Orlando Serpa, the local who filmed the incident and posted the video, said: 'Today the bull attacked a horse and people armed with knives from inside the bullfight venue chopped the horse alive in front of the whole community. The video speaks for itself.' Animal rights NGO AnimaNaturalis said they will start legal action against mayor Quintiliano Tapi for organising the event where the incident happened. Spokeswoman Andreea Padilla said: 'The mayor knows exactly how serious it was, after all he was present when it took place.' The Mayor however has denied that he was there saying: 'The reality is that I was not there but we are going to follow all the usual judicial procedures and look at the facts before deciding what to do.' Julio Cesar Guerra, governor of Sucre Department where Buenavista is located, said: 'I can only condemn what happened and I hope this behaviour will not repeat itself. The things that were done were extreme cruelty and an exemplary punishment is required.' World Horse Welfare Chief Executive Roly Owers told MailOnline: 'Shocking and disgusting don't even get close to describing this horrific footage. I am aghast both at the butchering of a horse whilst it was still alive and at the bull attack. No society in the world could defend such grim abuse, for entertainment, for the food chain or for any other reason. The Americas were built on the backs of horses and they deserve respect, not this barbaric treatment.'

"The Great Dying, which struck the Earth a quarter of a billion years ago, claimed more lives than any other mass extinction in the planet's history. The most popular theory for its cause is volcanic eruptions that led to immense amounts of basalt lava spreading across Siberia over a period of 600,000 years. Now, evidence of vinegar-like acid rain caused by the sulphur dioxide in these eruption has been found by researchers scouring 250 million-year-old rocks in Italy. In an attempt to explain how vanillin could exist in the rocks for so long, the researchers turned to the dairy industry, which sometimes uses vanilla in milk.Acidifying the milk protects vanillin as the low pH deactivates the enzymes that would break it down. The same can be said for vanillin in ancient rock . 'For the first time, we can say that soils from this time had an acidity similar to that of vinegar,' Mark Sephton, a geologist at Imperial College London told Smithsonian.com. The rocks in Italy's Vigo Meano contained vanillin – the substance that gives vanilla its distinct taste and flavour. The discovery was a surprise, as vanillin is usually broken down by bacteria. In an attempt to explain how vanillin could exist in the rocks for so long, the researchers turned to the dairy industry, which sometimes uses vanilla in milk. The rocks provide further evidence to suggest the Great Dying was triggered by massive volcanic eruptions that spewed out of sulphur dioxide that in turn caused acidic rain . Acidifying the milk protects vanillin as the low pH deactivates the enzymes that would break it down. The same can be said for vanillin in ancient rock. A huge impact event has been suggested as a possible cause of the mass extinction, based on the examination of grains of 'shocked quartz' and meteorite fragments in Antarctica, but no impact site has been found. One of the attractions of the theory is that it could trigger other causes such as the Siberian Traps eruptions. Widespread ocean anoxia (a severe deficiency of oxygen) has also been blamed for the event in the Late Permian to the Early Triassic. The spread of toxic, oxygen-depleted water would have been devastating for marine life, producing widespread die-offs. Models of ocean chemistry show that anoxia and euxinia (the presence of hydrogen sulphide) would have been closely associated with high levels of carbon dioxide, which suggests a combination of gases acted as a killing mechanism. 'Our data fits the idea that acid rain caused the microbes to cease functioning,' says Henk Visscher, a paleoecologist at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. The findings follow a similar study in 2013 by US scientists who simulated the Great Dying. The MIT researchers found that sulphur emissions from massive volcano eruptions were significant enough to create extremely acidic rain, which could have affected plant growth. They believe such acidity may have been sufficient to disfigure plants and stunt their growth, contributing to their ultimate extinction. 'Imagine you're a plant that's growing happily in the latest Permian,' said Benjamin Black, a postdoctoral researcher in MIT's Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences. 'It's been getting hotter and hotter, but perhaps your species has had time to adjust to that. But then quite suddenly, over the course of a few months, the rain begins to sizzle with sulphuric acid. It would be quite a shock if you were that plant,' he said. After the eruptions ended, the researchers found believe pH levels in rain bounced back, becoming less acidic within one year. The rocks in Italy's Vigo Meano contained vanillin – the substance that gives vanilla its distinct taste and flavour. The discovery was a surprise, as vanillin is usually broken down by bacteria . Meteor impacts contributed to wiping out species during mass extinction events on Earth . Ordovician-Silurian mass extinction - 443.4 million years ago . This was the third largest extinction in Earth's history, and had two peaks of dying separated by hundreds of thousands of years. Around 26 per cent of all marine families were wiped out and 60 per cent of all genera - an estimated 82-88 per cent of all species. Late Devonian mass extinction - 375-359 million years ago . Three quarters of all species on Earth died out in the Late Devonian mass extinction, though it may have been a series of extinctions over several million years. Around 22 per cent of all marine families, and 57 per cent of all genera were wiped out - an estimated 79-87 per cent of all species. Permian mass extinction - 252 million years ago . The Permian mass extinction has been nicknamed The Great Dying, since an incredible 96 per cent of species died out. All life on Earth today is descended from the 4 per cent of species that survived. Triassic-Jurassic mass extinction - 201 million years ago . There were two or three phases of extinction that made up the Triassic-Jurassic mass extinction event. 22 per cent of all marine families and 53 per cent of all genera - an estimated 76-84 per cent of all species. Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction - 66 million years ago . The Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction was the event that wiped out the dinosaurs. However, many other organisms perished including 16 per cent of all marine families and 47 per cent of all genera - an estimated 71-81 per cent of all species.","Geologists made the discovery after studying rocks in Italy's Vigo Meano .
They contained vanillin, which can only survive in acidic conditions .
'For the first time, we can say that soils from this time had an acidity similar to that of vinegar,' said Mark Sephton, one of the lead geologists .
The rocks provide further evidence to suggest the Great Dying was triggered by massive volcanic eruptions that spewed out of sulphur dioxide ."
"With its pin-hole camera, circuit board and miniature battery - this tiny gadget looks like a secret agent's spying device. But in fact it is so common the majority of us carry the same thing around with us all day, every day. MailOnline can reveal today criminal gangs are adapting mobile phone video cameras and hiding them in cash points to help empty bank accounts. This device has been secretly helping to fuel a rise in the £100million-a-year card fraud industry in Britain. Scroll down for video . Fuelling massive fraud: Gangs hide adapted mobile phone video cameras under a false panel on the front of ATM machine to record PIN numbers while at the same time using another device to trap or clone bank cards . Covert: While police advise potential victims to look out for anything suspicious, they warn against taking devices away because there's a fair chance these gangs could come after you to get them back . After being stripped from its phone housing, the camera is hidden under a false panel above an ATM keypad. It then secretly records unsuspecting customers as they tap in their PIN while all the time being watched by  thieves just metres away. The video recording is then used in conjunction with a separate device placed over the card slot that can either trap or clone your card, giving fraudsters all the information they need to plunder your accounts. While police advise potential victims to look out for anything suspicious, they warn against taking devices away because there's a good chance these gangs could come after you to get them back. Very often, they will be loaded with data which could potentially be worth thousands of pounds, but also, crucially, evidence that could incriminate them. 'They will be watching you,' says Tony Blake, crime prevention officer at the Dedicated Cheque and Plastic Crime Unit DCPCU), a police unit sponsored by the banking industry. 'If you go off with their camera, they might come after you to get their equipment back. 'It's best not to try looking for devices fitted by fraudsters as the vast majority are very small and well concealed.' The industrial scale of these cons was highlighted last month when two fraudsters were jailed for a total of six years over a scam which netted more than £2million worth of stolen card details from potentially thousands of victims. Florin Ardel, 25, and Ioan Flore, 33, were arrested after officers found an 'Aladdin's cave' of card cloning equipment including camera panels and false fronts at an address in London, plus stolen numbers for nearly 5,000 bank cards. And it's a growing business. Fraud on lost or stolen cards increased by three per cent to £29.2 million during the first half of last year, up from £28.2million in the same period of 2013. Similarly, counterfeit fraud - cards that are cloned - increased by four per cent to £24.2million, up from £23.3 million. Figures for the remaining six months of last year have not yet been published, but the total figure for 2013 came to £102.3million. Mr Blake said: 'The best way to beat the fraudsters is always to protect your PIN when using a cash machine by shielding your hand. 'If you spot anything unusual about the cash machine or there are signs of tampering, do not use it.' Measuring about a foot long, the false panels are carefully painted to match the appearance of the machine have the word 'Cash' stamped on the front with a small hole in the bottom for the camera . Experts says the best way to beat fraudsters is always to protect your PIN by shielding your hand . If you do notice anything suspicious or if the ATM does swallow your card, the advice is to call your bank straightaway. He told MailOnline: 'Make sure you store your bank's 24-hour phone number in your mobile phone, and if your card is retained by the cash machine, or your money is not dispensed, immediately report the incident to your bank while you are still nearby.' A similar, but more sophisticated con, which is also used in conjunction with a mobile phone camera is known as card skimming. Here, an electronic device is fitted around the card slot to capture data contained on the magnetic strip as it enters the ATM which is then downloaded to a memory card contained within the device. Counterfeits are then made up using any card with a magnetic strip such store cards or phone top-ups. Armed with those two, and with the customer having received their card back and not believing anything is untoward, the criminals have carte blanche to wreak havoc with your account. How I discovered mobile camera fraud after an ATM  swallowed my card and my friend ripped off the front of the cashpoint . By Simon Tomlinson . I was caught up in such a scam after a night out in east London last month. After putting my card in the slot and keying in my PIN (without covering it up, I hasten to add), I waited for my cash, only to find the machine had swallowed my card. Noticing something was amiss, my friend started pulling at a panel above the keypad and after a few wiggles it duly came off in his hand. Big business: Fraud on lost or stolen cards increased by three per cent to £29.2 million this year, while counterfeit fraud (cards that are cloned) increased by four per cent to £24.2million . Measuring about a foot long, it had been carefully painted to match the appearance of the machine and had the word 'Cash' stamped on the front to match the lettering seen on most ATMS. Underneath, we found what appeared at first sight to be an elaborate purpose-built piece of kit consisting of a circuit board, camera, wiring and a memory card. A small hole had been bored into the underside of the panel to give the camera a clear view of the keypad. Bemused and intrigued, we took it away with us while I  phoned the bank to cancel my card, giving them my address and certain elements of my security password, all the time with the device close by. Suddenly, as we merrily discussed our new acquisition, it suddenly dawned on us that it could be relaying our conversations back to the gang - or at very least storing it on the memory card in our possession. With frequent looks over our shoulder, we made off in haste and ditched the device before getting the bus home – to the address I had given in full to the bank. I slept with one eye open that night wondering if I might get paid a visit, but fortunately they didn't. By the taking the camera with me, I did, however, inadvertently prevent large-scale fraud potentially to the tune of hundreds of pounds. What I didn't realise at the time was that within just a few seconds of  leaving the ATM, the fraudsters had swooped in to grab my card, which had been trapped inside another false front over the card slot. Known as a 'Lebanese Loop', it is designed to prevent the card being returned to the customer, thereby shutting the machine down. But without knowing my PIN, they could only use the contactless element of my card. Yet despite having cancelled it within a few minutes, they were still able to make two payments totalling around £40 from a nearby off licence in time before the cancellation took effect. Highlighting the industrial scale of these ATM cons, two fraudsters were jailed for a total of six years last month for a scam which netted over £2million worth of stolen card details from potentially thousands of victims. Florin Ardel, 25, and Ioan Flore, 33, were arrested after officers found an ‘Aladdin’s cave’ of card skimming equipment at an address in Southgate, London. Officers had followed Ardel back to the property after spotting a gang acting suspiciously around an ATM in Mayfair. Ioan Flore (left) and Florin Ardel (right) were jailed for a total of six years over a £2m stolen bank card fraud . Ardel was then seen dumping gift cards bear four-digit numbers on the back into a rubbish bin outside. When officers searched the property, they found an array of card-skimming devices, with side camera bars, false ATM fronts and memory devices. A forensic download of the computers found in excess of 4,800 unique debit and credit card numbers, as well as specialist software used to transfer the details onto blank cards for use in cash machines overseas. The stolen card details had a value of £2.05million, based on the average amount stolen from a compromised card. Ioan Flore returned to the property during the search and was also arrested. He was later forensically linked to the items seized from inside the property. Ardel and Flore, both of Southgate, London, were sentenced to two years and three months and three years and nine months in prison respectively. DC Martin Godsave , officer in the case from the DCPCU, said: 'These two criminals were committing card fraud on an industrial scale. ‘We discovered what can only be described as an Aladdin's cave of card skimming equipment, with thousands of potential victims.’","MailOnline can reveal mobile phone cameras are being hidden in ATMs .

"Danger zone: Chiwetel Ejiofor came close to whipping a fellow actor for real during the filming of 12 Years A Slave . Chiwetel Ejiofor remembered that for such a dark moment it was a very hot, beautiful day ‘and blue sky as far as the eye could see’. The award-winning actor was in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, where he had to act in a scene for Steve McQueen’s masterpiece, 12 Years A Slave. Chiwetel portrays the real-life Solomon Northup, a freeman who was abducted and sold into slavery. All of a sudden, every-thing he’d held dear — his wife, his children, his name and his  freedom — were stripped from him. He was someone else’s property. The scene I’m referring to involves Michael Fassbender as Edwin Epps — a cruel, Bible-quoting plantation owner — Chiwetel’s Solomon and Patsey (played by Lupita Nyong’o), known as the Cotton Queen for her high cotton-picking yields, who is forced to satisfy ‘the predilections and peculiarities’ of Epps at any time of the day and night. In this particular scene, Epps wants Patsey flayed alive — and demands Solomon does it. ‘When Solomon describes the beating of Patsey in his book, he feels that nowhere else in the world was there a darker moment happening,’ Chiwetel told me. We were talking in London on Monday about the making of the film, which has received seven Golden Globe nominations and is expected to haul in many more when Bafta and Oscar categories are revealed next month. ‘I remember I rode in with Lupito that day. It was early and we had a conversation about it,’ he said. During shooting, a stunt man monitored the whipping and marked an area that Chiwetel and Fassbender could not cross. ‘It was very technical. If you stepped across the mark, you would be in the danger zone and Lupita would have been lashed for real. Dark: In one scene Chiwetel's character is made by Edwin Epps, played by Michael Fassbender, to beat one of his fellow slaves . ‘Of course, we never got that  close. We just did the best we could to recreate the dark moment.’ When Solomon is abducted, Chiwetel, too, was beaten — whacked with a wooden paddle until it splintered for real. ‘There was no way of avoiding that. You couldn’t tell the story without showing what the psychological humiliation was,’ he said. Yet, strangely, in a way the film is a love story. The yearning and longing Solomon has for his family is raw. ‘It’s about how powerful the connection we have to our family and the ones we love, and how when that’s disrupted it creates a whole other kind of fire,’ Chiwetel told me. Drama: Chiwetel's character Solomon with his fellow slave Patsey, played by Lupita Nyong'o . ‘Solomon doesn’t want to survive — he wants to live. ‘It’s that belief that he will see his loved ones again that helps him. It’s also part of what puts him in danger of losing his  mind.’ That the actor can convey such a complex set of emotions without going over the top marks his  performance as the best of  his career so far in the  hottest picture of this year — and probably the next one, too. It opens here on January 10. Don’t miss it. Rising star: Alicia Vikander, the fast-rising Swedish-born actress, will portray World War I writer and pacifist Vera Brittain in a film based on her seminal memoir A Testament Of Youth . Alicia Vikander, the fast-rising Swedish-born actress, will portray World War I writer and pacifist Vera Brittain in a film based on her seminal memoir A Testament Of Youth. It is about the generation — including Brittain’s brother, fiancé and other close friends — who lost their lives during the Great War. The movie — which is being produced by David Heyman and BBC Films — will go before cameras in the spring to be ready for a Remembrance Sunday release next year, which also marks the 100th anniversary of the start of the war. Brittain’s book also chronicles her own battles with her father over her determination to go to university, as her brother had. By 1915, she felt compelled to do what she could to help the war effort, so Brittain (the mother of Liberal Democrat politician Shirley Williams), joined the Voluntary Aid Detachment to tend those who had been wounded at the front. But more than anything, it’s a heart-breaking story of the once-gilded youth hurled into what war poet Wilfred Owen called the ‘scorching cautery’ of war. By the time of the Armistice in 1918, Brittain had lost her brother, Edward, her fiancé, Roland Leighton, and close family friends Geoffrey Thurlow and Victor Richards. Brittain’s memoir, published in 1933, became an instant classic, but during World War II its pacifist sensibility was frowned upon. However, the BBC produced an acclaimed five-part drama which pushed the book onto the  bestseller list. Reading it again now, it makes you demand to know why our fighting men were sent to Iraq and Afghanistan. Ms Vikander has just finished work on Guy Ritchie’s The Man From U.N.C.L.E. and Alex Garland’s mad scientist drama Ex Machina. Winner: Alicia Vikander receives the Best Performance by an Actress award for 'Hotell' from Marion Cotillard and Golshifteh Farahani at the Marrakech International Film Festival . After she completes Testament Of Youth for director James Kent (his TV drama The Thirteenth Tale with Vanessa Redgrave and Olivia Colman is being shown on BBC2 on New Year’s Eve), she will move onto the long-awaited movie Tulip Fever, with Justin Chadwick (who made the Mandela movie) as director. Dane DeHaan will be her leading man in Tulip Fever, while Christoph Waltz and Bill Nighy are being discussed for the other main male role, though it depends on dates as to which one will do it. Talking of dates, it had been hoped that Saoirse Ronan, star of Hanna, would portray Vera Brittain. But she is due to start another movie, Brooklyn, at the same time Testament Of Youth will be shooting. Refreshing: Oscar Isaac plays a musician who is an anti-star in the new Coen Brothers movie Inside Llewyn Davis . Oscar Isaac (right) plays a musician who’s an anti-star in the new Coen Brothers movie. ‘He’s very working-class, he’s happy doing his own thing, he doesn’t want fame and he’s not manicured or manufactured,’ Oscar said of the title role he plays in Inside Llewyn Davis, the luminous new movie by Joel and Ethan Coen, which opens here on January 24. That’s probably one of the reasons I love the movie so much, because Llewyn Davis disdains the very idea of marketing himself. He just wants to play his guitar, sing and get into trouble. ‘It’s so refreshing, about someone who refuses to be socially and commercially manufactured,’ Oscar told me. The film is set in the Sixties when there was a converging of traditional American music with the sounds coming out of the beat generation. Anyone for Dylan? Well, Llewyn Davis, who has nowhere to live and is a shambles, is the anti-Dylan. ‘He’s a rebellious artist. He’s a miserable f***,’ Oscar said.Yet he’s fascinating. I’ve seen the film three times in six months and never tire of it. Carey Mulligan is Jean, a singer married to a fellow performer played by Justin Timberlake — but Llewyn Davis has cuckolded Timberlake’s character. At one  point, Jean snarls at Llewyn: ‘Everything you touch turns to s***. You’re like King Midas’s idiot brother’. It’s a put-down that sticks. During the first week of filming, all the cast waited for the Coen brothers’ approval after each take. ‘We’re used to having our egos stroked,’ Oscar said. When it wasn’t forthcoming, some thought they were going to be fired, but later realised the Coens don’t waste precious time massaging egos. So, in case no one told him: Oscar, your performance is sensational.","Actor Chiwetel Ejiofor stars in new Steve McQueen 'masterpiece'

"A motorist drove at speeds of up to 70mph behind a windscreen almost totally obscured in snow. The unknown person at the wheel of the grey Renault was spotted driving with snow covering the front of the car on the M60 over Barton Bridge in Greater Manchester - to the horror of other drivers. The driver who captured the footage said he was 'gobsmacked' when the snow-covered car pulled into view behind him in the outside lane of the southbound carriageway, at about 50mph. Shocking: The person behind the wheel of the grey Renault was spotted driving with snow covering the front of the car on the M60 over Barton Bridge in Greater Manchester - to the horror of other drivers . A jeep behind the Renault could be seen urgently flashing its headlights in warning. The footage was captured by a motorist who had installed a rear-facing dashcam in his vehicle after an accident. In total he captured three minutes of footage of the car being driven covered in snow, but said the vehicle drove for longer than that before turning off the M60, sometimes reaching speeds of 70mph. The driver, who asked not to be identified, has already contacted police to offer them the footage which he captured on Monday. He said: ‘I installed the dashcam after I had an accident where someone shunted me. I had come on to the M60 from the M62 and was just travelling along when I noticed the car behind. ‘I just thought, “how the blooming heck is that person driving?” They followed me for quite a long way - the video captures three minutes but they were driving like that for longer. Snow-covered windscreen: The driver who captured the footage said he was 'gobsmacked' when the snow-covered car pulled into the lane behind him in the outside lane of the southbound carriageway . ‘I was just absolutely gobsmacked that they could drive - they must have barely been able to see. 'I do a lot of motorway driving and when you see idiots like that you really feel that you should make people aware of how dangerous it is. It may have been that the snow was on the roof and then it slid down, but they have just driven on with it like that, trying to look through the little slit. ‘They turned off at a junction but before that I'd sped up to 70mph and they were still behind me, driving like that. It is just stupid.’ A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said the force would look at the footage when they received it to investigate if a motoring offence had been committed. The scene was revealed as heavy snow caused travel chaos for commuters across parts of the country, with one car skidding off an icy road and crashing into the front of a house. Yorkshire, the Midlands and the west coast of Scotland all saw snow overnight, with Leeds Bradford Airport being forced to close. The Met Office said parts of Cumbria had seen 1.6in (4cm) of snow.","Renault driver spotted on M60 over Barton Bridge in Greater Manchester .

"Proposals for 'fracking' for shale gas at two sites in Lancashire should be refused, planning officers have recommended. Lancashire County Council has published reports with recommendations on planning applications from shale company Cuadrilla to develop two new sites to explore for shale gas by drilling, fracking and testing the flow of gas. The council's development control committee is due to make decisions next week on the planning applications for the two sites, at Preston New Road, near Little Plumpton, and Roseacre Wood, near Roseacre, both between Blackpool and Preston. Scroll down for video . Cuadrilla Resources wanted to develop one possible fracking location near Rosacre Wood, pictured . The company also lodged an application at a second site near Preston New Road, near Plumpton, pictured . Cuadrilla Resources wanted to use a drilling rig similar to this one in Blackpool to recover the gas . The report recommended that the application for the site at Preston New Road should be turned down because of concerns over noise impacts which would 'unnecessarily and unacceptably' affect neighbouring properties with noise pollution. At the Roseacre Wood site, the report said there would be an increase in traffic, particularly heavy goods vehicles, which would result in 'an unacceptable impact' on rural roads and reduce road safety. If the council's development control committee take the advice of their planning officers and turn down the applications, it will be seen as a major blow to efforts to get the UK's shale gas and oil industry off the ground. Caudrilla said today in a statement that it was 'very disappointed at the recommendation. 'After an extraordinarily lengthy period of consultation and review of around seven months we are surprised that, at this late point, the planning team at Lancashire County Council has raised objections about background noise for both sites. 'We believe, supported by independent experts Arup, that we have come forward with measures that would mitigate the noise of drilling and fracturing and the proposed noise levels are within the limits set out in government guidance.' Cuadrilla Resources wanted to explore two potential shale gas locations near Blackpool and Preston . The company said it had supplied extra information regarding traffic routes for the Roseacre Wood site, and believed it had addressed all the issues raised. 'In the end the councillors on the development control committee will have to weigh the relatively minor impacts which affect only a small number of households and for which we have proposed adequate proposals for mitigation against the wider local and national economic and energy security benefits. 'We will await the councillors' decisions on both these applications and we believe that all of the limited issues that have been raised can be resolved.' The Government is pushing for the development of a shale gas industry in the UK, claiming it would create jobs and growth, reduce energy prices and cut the country's reliance on gas imports. However, opponents have raised fears that the process causes earthquakes, can pollute water supplies, and could lead to inappropriate development in the countryside and damage house prices. Hydraulic fracturing - or fracking - involves pumping water, chemicals and sand at high pressure underground to fracture shale rock and release the gas trapped in it. Hundreds of protesters attended a six-day Reclaim The Power camp last August near the proposed Little Plumpton site to campaign against shale gas extraction in the region by fracking. The controversial technique has led to fears that water supplies could be contaminated by toxic  chemicals . Local authorities in West Sussex have also turned down applications from shale companies to explore for oil and gas in their areas. The Roseacre Wood site should be refused planning permission because of the traffic issue and noise pollution, the planning officers said. They recommended refusing the Preston New Road site on the noise issue alone. The report into the planning applications said shale gas exploration was in principle 'acceptable', and that the impacts on air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, landscape, water resources and seismic movements at the sites were low or could be lessened. But the proposed developments would lead to 'significant increase in night-time background noise levels'. 'Consequently it is likely that this would have significant adverse effects on the health and quality of life and lead to an unacceptable loss of residential amenity' to nearby residents, the report says of each site. For the Roseacre Wood application, the planning officers also raised concerns that it was in a 'very rural location' served by small country lanes, and it should be turned down on those grounds too. They said: 'An assessment concludes that the increase in traffic, particularly HGV movements, would be severe, there would be a material impact on existing road users, particularly vulnerable road users and overall highway safety of which the potential is considered severe. Environmental campaigners Greenpeace hailed the recommendation to turn down the applications. Greenpeace said that people in Lancashire were afraid of the risks caused by traffic, noise, water contamination and even the value of their homes if permission was granted for a similar site to this . Greenpeace energy campaigner Simon Clydesdale said: 'Many thousands of people in Lancashire are seriously worried about the potential risks of fracking - traffic, noise, water contamination, air pollution, the value of their homes, to name just a few. 'The concerns about noise and traffic brought up by the planners are a reminder that fracking could be a lot of pain for very little or no gain for communities in Lancashire. 'The council now faces a clear choice: They can listen to the planners, and the Lancashire residents that elected them - almost two-thirds of whom want a moratorium on fracking - or they can kowtow to the corporate and political interests keen to force through fracking at almost any cost. 'The whole country is looking to Lancashire to protect its communities from the unnecessary risks that fracking plays with our futures.' Lee Petts, spokesman for the North West Energy Task Force, a coalition of more than 500 businesses and academics, said: 'Natural gas from North West shale could be a massive opportunity for growth, investment, jobs and revenues in our region. 'Today's announcements are obviously disappointing, but we await the decision of the development control committee next week, and call on councillors to grasp this opportunity to create the jobs and investment that Lancashire badly needs.' Friends Of The Earth's North West campaigner Helen Rimmer said: 'We are delighted that the planning officers have recognised the serious effects that these developments would have on neighbouring residents and have recommended that Lancashire County Council refuses these applications. 'Councillors must now act on this and the tens of thousands of objections they have received and reject Cuadrilla's fracking applications next week. 'Only by doing so will they ensure that fracking is not allowed to cause further climate change while also putting communities and the local environment at risk.' Philip Mace, Partner at Clyde and Company's Oil and Gas Team said the decision in Lancashire could have long term implications to the viability of the industry. He said: 'This could be a potentially disastrous decision for the future of shale oil and gas development in the UK. 'With oil and gas prices having fallen dramatically, the E&P industry is unlikely to have the appetite or backing to face the long and expensive approval process that is being required to carry out fracking in the UK. 'One remaining glimmer of hope is the proposed underground access rights for shale oil and gas extraction included in the Infrastructure Bill, which is still going through Parliament. But even that is not a given. 'Despite the Government’s desire to make change happen, there are only 100-odd days to the election and the fracking related elements of the Infrastructure Bill have been fiercely debated and may well not make the statute books in the remaining time available.' A spokesperson for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: 'This is a matter for the local planning authority to determine. 'The Government cannot comment on a live planning application. The Government continues to support the development of the shale industry in the UK.' A spokesman for United Kingdom Onshore Oil and Gas (UKOOG), who represent the industry said: 'It is disappointing that officials at Lancashire County Council have come to this recommendation. 'We need to review the detail of their advice before commenting further, but on first instance it appears that these are local planning matters specific to these sites rather than any issues that would have an obvious impact on other shale gas applications.'","Cuadrilla Resources wants to drill for gas between Preston and Blackpool .

"A mother killed her 'evil' daughter after being turned against her by a lesbian lover who had assumed a bizarre set of male alter egos, a court heard. Polly Chowdhury, 35, is accused of murdering Ayesha Ali - who was found at her Essex home with more than 50 injuries - together with her lover Kiki Muddar after being caught in a web of fiction. Muddar, 43, created aliases such as 'Jimmy Chowdhury' and a spiritual Muslim named 'Skyman', jurors heard, who had sex with Chowdhury and sent her texts saying: 'Your daughter will pay'. In the dock: Polly Chowdhury, 35 (left) is accused of murdering her own daughter together with Kiki Muddar (right) after Muddar assumed a bizarre set of male alter egos which turned the mother against the young girl . Aftermath: A 999 heard Ayesha was dead and that Chowdhury (above), her mother, had tried to kill herself and was in the bath. When paramedics arrived in August 2013 they discovered the girl had 50 injuries . Chowdhury held her head in her hands and wept in the dock beside Muddar as a murder trial began against both women at the Old Bailey today. The court heard Ayesha, eight, was found dead  at Chowdhury's home in Chadwell Heath, Essex, in August 2013 after a neighbour heard 'loud, piercing, distressed screaming' earlier that month. She had suffered more than 50 injuries to her head, body and limbs, including carpet burns and a bite mark on her shoulder. Muddar dialled 999 to say Ayesha was dead, and that Chowdhury had tried to kill herself and was in the bath. Paramedics discovered the body of the little girl 'cold and stiff' lying along the side of her bed dressed only in a pair of pants. The cause of her death was a head injury. On guard: Police at the scene of Chowdhury's flat in August 2013, where Muddar had been living with her . Prosecutor Richard Whittam QC said: 'At the core of this case is the relationship between Kiki Muddar and Polly Chowdhury. 'To say that their relationship was unconventional is a gross understatement. It was complex and involved fictional characters.' He said the pair had first struck up a close friendship when they lived near each other. In 2012, Muddar moved into Chowdhury's home, forcing her husband to sleep downstairs and leading to the eventual breakdown of the marriage. Mr Whittam said Chowdhury was turned against her own daughter by Muddar and her array of fictional characters. One was a so-called spiritual Muslim called Skyman who only communicated by text, and the mother tried to act in a way that would 'please him', the court heard. Chilling messages in capital letters by 'Skyman' - from Muddar's phone - were read to the court. One read: 'Your daughter was staring at your soulmate why was she not disciplined'. Others read 'Your daughter will pay', 'your daughter can have the pain', 'your daughter will destroyed', and 'your daughter is eveil [sic] you never disciplined her today'. Another read: 'You have no right to ever love or like your evil daughter'. The prosecutor also said Chowdhury had fallen in love with another of Muddar's fictional Facebook characters, a man named Jimmy Chowdhury. A sexual relationship developed between the women because Chowdhury thought she was having sex with her soulmate 'through the medium of Kiki'. But the prosecutor said: 'He is a fiction pieced together by Kiki Muddar. He existed only on Facebook, by text message or through Kiki Muddar herself. 'There was a photograph of a man she had placed on the Facebook page but that was not Jimmy Chowdhury. In a phone call to a friend a month before Ayesha died, Muddar described the girl as a 'witch' and threatened to drown her and go to prison, jurors were told. She allegedly said: 'I'm going to go to prison tonight' 'Polly Chowdhury never met him, nor did she speak to him, yet it appears Polly Chowdhury fell in love with this fictional Jimmy Chowdhury.' Mr Whittam said there was 'ample evidence' of Muddar's strength of feeling towards Chowdhury and her attitude towards Ayesha expressed through thousands of text messages, Facebook entries and telephone calls. In a phone call to a friend a month before Ayesha died, Muddar described the girl as a 'witch' and threatened to drown her and go to prison, jurors were told. She allegedly said: 'I'm going to f****** kill her. I will drown her in the f****** bath. I will drown that witch. I'm going to go to prison tonight.' Muddar also pretended to have cancer and blamed Chowdhury for making her condition worse, the court heard. Added to the 'complexity', Muddar also claimed to receive text messages from a former lover who she claimed had died in the London riots. Muddar, of Ilford, Essex, and Chowdhury, Chadwell Heath, Essex, deny murder, manslaughter and causing or allowing the death of a child between March 1 and August 29 2013. The trial continues.

The Leicester branch's bouncer prompted outrage after witnesses claimed he was asked if a straight couple would be more 'acceptable' - and replied: 'Yes'. Matthew Dummigan, 23, said he was giving a male friend a simple 'peck' on the lips when the bouncer told him to stop. Branch:  McDonald's in Leicester city centre has apologised and its doorman has been suspended after Matthew Dummigan, 23, was told giving a male friend a simple 'peck' on the lips made people feel 'uneasy' One of the four friends who was with Mr Dummigan began arguing with the doorman's views and was thrown out, he said. 'It was horrific,' said Mr Dummigan, a dancer and choreographer. 'He said it was making people feel uneasy. It was really upsetting for me. 'I tried to confront him about it - I told him his attitude wasn't right. I was really angry and upset. 'Gay people can get married and divorced, yet they get told off for showing a bit of affection - his attitude was so outdated.' Mr Dummigan, who felt 'insulted', 'belittled' and 'patronised', said he held himself together until he got outside, then he 'broke down'. 'One of my friends stuck up for us and he got chucked out,' he added. 'I've been out as gay for seven years and I have never witnessed anything like this in my life. I read about things like this happening in the papers but I never thought it would happen to me. 'It wasn't even a proper kiss, it was a peck.' Comparison: The story comes after two BBC DJs who held hands for an experiment, Iain Lee and Justin Dealey (pictured), received homophobic abuse in the street in Luton, Bedfordshire . A spokesman for McDonald's said: 'We are very sorry for Mr Dummigan's experience when visiting our restaurant. 'We have taken this complaint very seriously and are conducting a thorough internal investigation and while this is happening have suspended the security guard in question. 'Our customer care team is in touch with Mr Dummigan.' The spokesman said the alleged incident would not be in line with the chain's diversity policies. He added the chain had apologised for the way in which Mr Dummigan was treated. The incident happened just days after two BBC local radio DJs received homophobic abuse for holding hands as a social experiment. Iain Lee and Justin Dealey posed as a couple in Luton, Bedfordshire, where passers-by said 'ugh' and 'disgusting' at them and one father ushered away his child. 'It certainly felt uncomfortable,' said Mr Lee. 'I know if you'd been a girl and I was holding your hand, there would have been nothing. I'm surprised and disappointed.'","Doorman suspended after Matthew Dummigan shared 'peck' with a friend .

"Super blogger Tavi Gevinson took a break from her busy Broadway schedule earlier this month in order to offer fans a peek inside her Manhattan apartment. The 18-year-old, who has just finished starring in a critically-acclaimed production of This Is Our Youth on Broadway, invited fashion website The Coveteur into the Lower East Side home that she shares with close friend and photographer Petra Collins. Focusing on some of her favorite fashion pieces from her diverse and eclectic wardrobe, Tavi revealed that she has managed to collect some truly unique - and priceless - pieces over the years, including a pair of leather gold gloves gifted to her by actress Winona Ryder, who had in turn received them from style icon Audrey Hepburn. City living: Blogger turned Broadway actress Tavi Gevinson is living in Manhattan on the Lower East Side . Multi-talented: The 18-year-old writer has just finished starring in a production of This Is Our Youth alongside Michael Cera and Kieran Culkin. She is also working on the fourth edition of her annual Rookie yearbook . Then there is are the pleated lip-print skirts which she was given by designer Miuccia Prada, and the gold Chanel boots that she received as a gift from singer Stevie Nicks. Needless to say, despite her youth, Tavi is already recognized as one of fashion's most successful young writers, having written pieces for the likes of Elle and Vogue and interviewed everyone from Miley Cyrus and Alexa Chung to Emma Watson, who she now counts as a close friend. 'Lorde, Emma Watson and Sky Ferreira all opened up in ways they don’t normally in interviews and I really appreciated that,' she told The Coveteur, adding: 'I owe so much of my brain to so many people.' The teen success story first started her career while she was still in middle school, when she founded Rookie Mag, a publication aimed at young people of her own age. She admitted that she 'didn't sleep at all' during the first year after she founded the magazine and website, and confessed that it was sometimes a struggle to maintain a healthy balance between her school work - which she labeled as 'pointless' - and the pressures of keeping up to date with all of the content on the site. Fashion icon: Despite her young age, Tavi is known as one of the industry's most successful writers . Personal meaning: Tavi's apartment is full of gifts that she has received from close friends and admirers. The red shoes in this picture were given to her by Comme des Garçons founder Rei Kawakubo . Passion or obsession? The writer's passion and dedication to Rookie, which she founded while she was in middle school, is clear to see from the number of personalized knick-knacks scattered throughout her home . 'When I think back, there was truly nothing else I wanted to do,' she said. 'Like my mom suggested coming home and relaxing, and I said something like: ""If I wanted to relax, I would work on Rookie.""' There is evidence of her ongoing passion and devotion to Rookie scattered throughout her home - which she shares with one of the magazine's main contributors Petra Collins. Personalized jewelry emblazoned with the magazine's name can be found on numerous surfaces, adorning many a knick-knack, while she also keeps a large stack of the magazine's annual print yearbook alongside the various gifts she has received over the years from some of her most famous admirers. In addition to her favorite fashion pieces already highlighted by the fashion website, the teenage writer also pointed out a Sulamith Wulfing book, which was another gift from singer Stevie Knicks, and a pair of shoes given to her by Comme des Garçons founder Rei Kawakubo. Hitting the headlines: Earlier this month, Tavi was unveiled as the newest face of jewelry brand Alexis Bittar, alongside interior designer Iris Apfel . The final curtain: Tavi's Broadway run recently came to an end after months of critically-acclaimed performances . But while her home already looks like she's been there for many years, as opposed to just a few months, Tavi admitted that she hasn't had a huge amount of time to explore New York, thanks to her hectic work schedule for This Is Our Youth. The relentless performance timetable hasn't stopped her from pursuing new and exciting work projects however. Earlier this month, it was revealed that Tavi had been signed up as the face of New York-based jewelry label Alexis Bittar, alongside 93-year-old interior designer and fashion icon Iris Aprfel. Shortly after the campaign launched, Tavi posted the picture on her Instagram account, commenting: 'So happy to be part of @alexisbittar's spring 2015 campaign next to Iris Apfel, whose style/wisdom/friendship has basically taught me how to live.'","The 18-year-old lives on the Lower East Side with her close friend and photographer Petra Collins .

"The Sydney Siege gunman Man Haron Monis was reportedly buried yesterday at an unknown location in New South Wales, more than a month after he was shot dead. Monis, a self-proclaimed sheik, was killed on December 16 after holding 18 people hostage for more than 17 hours at the Lindt Cafe in Martin Place, Sydney. His body was allegedly interred by the state as no one came forward to claim his remains and his partner, accused murderer Amirah Droudis, did not have the means to afford a burial. She allegedly is not aware of the details of the burial and gravediggers were made to sign a non-disclosure agreement, according to News Limited. Scroll down for video . Self-professed sheif Man Haron Monis (pictured in 2011) has reportedly been buried more than a month after he was shot dead after holding 18 people hostage at Martin Place's Lindt Cafe . Droudis is in custody after her bail was revoked on December 22, accused of murdering the mother of two of Monis' children, Noleen Hayson Pal in November 2013. The NSW Attorney General's office explained that the coroner ordered that no details be released due to the upcoming inquest into the siege, according to Nine News. Innocent civilians Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson were also tragically killed during the hostage crisis  and their deaths will be investigated during the inquest which will commence on January 29. The aim of the inquest will be to determine how the deaths occurred, the factors that contributed to them and whether they could have been prevented. Sydney's head Islamic funeral director has said that no Muslim funeral home will accept the body of Siege gunman Man Haron Monis, suggesting instead that authorities dump his body at sea. His body lay unclaimed at a morgue for almost a month whilst debate raged regarding the best course-of-action. Last month, a funeral director within the Lebanese Muslim Association declared that no Islamic funeral home would accept Monis' body. When asked about the fate of the 50-year old extremists body, Amin Sayed said 'we don't care about him, we don't know him, chuck him in the bloody sh**house.' 'Nobody's going to do his funeral. No Muslim funeral home will accept him,' he said. 'They can throw him in the bloody sea.' Mr Sayed had speculated that Monis would receive a secret funeral with an unmarked grave, and that they would not accept any amount of money to arrange his funeral. 'Anyone who does harm to Australians, we don't want him,' he said. Last month, a funeral director within the Lebanese Muslim Association declared that no Islamic funeral home would accept Monis' body . A NSW Health spokesperson told Daily Telegraph 'Local health districts are responsible for the processing and payment of destitute burials and cremations in their district.' 'Where the death of a person has occurred outside of a public health facility, and the police have determined that the state. 'Where the death of a person has occurred outside of a public health facility, and the police have determined that the state is ultimately responsible for their burial, the local health district will fund a funeral.'

"Investigators have found the bodies of two unidentified people in the charred remains of an Annapolis-area mansion that burned to the ground earlier this week. Anne Arundel Fire Department spokesman Capt. Russ Davies said cadaver dogs and searchers found the bodies. He said four people remain unaccounted for. Tech tycoon Don Pyle, 56, lived in the 16,000sq ft home with his wife Sandra. Authorities are yet to confirm the deaths but a local headteacher sent out a letter to staff and students on Tuesday confirming the family had been killed and naming the grandchildren as Lexi Boone, Katie Boone, Charlotte Boone and Wes Boone. Scroll down for video . Sorrow: Three grieving women embrace outside of the home, where Investigators found the bodies of two unidentified people on Wednesday . Cadaver dogs and searchers found the bodies among the still-smoking ruins of the Annapolis mansion . Owner: Don and Sandra Pyle were home the night of the blaze along with their four grandchildren, according to a local headteacher. Authorities are yet to confirm all six died . 'I never knew that I could hurt this badly,' Stacey Boone, mother to two daughters Lexi and Katie with Sandra Pyle's son Randy Boone, wrote on Facebook on Tuesday. 'It’s unreal. All one big nightmare that I can’t wake up from.' It is believed the other two children are the Pyles' grandchildren through another son. The bodies have been taken to the medical examiner's office in Baltimore for identification. Davies said he did not know how long it would take to identify the victims and determine their cause of death. He would not say whether the bodies were of adults or children. The Pyles and their four grandchildren have been missing since crews were called early on Monday to the scene of the blaze, which reduced a 16,000-square-foot waterfront castle to ruins. Gutted: The house, which still needed water poured on it, was ravaged by the flames. Only some of the stone core remained, along with some twisted metal frames . Town in mourning: Flowers and stuffed toys were left at the front gate of the $9million mansion which was detroyed in the blaze . Investigators began excavating the ruins on Wednesday. Davies was accompanied at the Wednesday news conference by several other officials, including Anne Arundel County State's Attorney Wes Adams, County Executive Steve Schuh, local police and fire officials and an agent from the federal bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The fire was reported about 3:30 a.m. on Monday by an alarm-monitoring company and a neighbor who spotted flames. Officials said it is unclear whether an alarm sounded inside the home, which might have alerted anyone inside. Some 85 firefighters from several jurisdictions fought the fire. Davies said because there was no hydrant in the area, firefighters shuttled tankers to the site and stationed a fire boat at a pier nearby. Davies said hot spots took about 10 hours to extinguish on Monday. One area flared up on Tuesday, and Davies said crews were monitoring it and extinguishing it as needed. Special Agent David Cheplak, a spokesman for the ATF's Baltimore field office, said earlier this week there were no immediate signs of foul play. Aftermath: Firefighters  took about 10 hours to extinguish hot spots on Monday and one area flared up on Tuesday again . Mansion fire: The $9million home in Annapolis, Maryland, caught fire around 3:30am Monday, and was reduced to ruins . Picturesque: In 2008, Pyle revealed  that the house had been built to be a combination of a castle and a beach house . Sources at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives toldCNN that the fire engulfed the mansion so fast that they suspect that chemicals may have been used to accelerate the burning. The official in charge of the ATF's investigation would not confirm whether the blaze was suspicious to DailyMail.com. Special Agent William McMullan said that specialists from across the country were headed to Annapolis, and would send in trained dogs to sniff out any traces of accelerant chemicals, which would help determine whether the blaze could have been a deliberate attack. However, Capt. Robert Howarth, commander of the county fire department's fire and explosives investigation unit, said on Tuesday that investigators were treating the site as a crime scene. Howarth said that is a common practice when there are no eyewitnesses, and it means only that anything recovered in the investigation would be admissible in court. On Monday, all authorities would say is that six individuals including four children were unaccounted. They could not confirm whether they had died in the blaze, and continue to investigate. Relatives, employers, investigators and reporters have all so far failed to reach either of the Pyles. Neighbor Caroline Wugofski said the Pyles often held parties at their home. She described them as 'genuinely nice people.' In a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, firefighting officials said they are still looking for the six people. They would not speculate on whether the fire was deliberate - but also refused to describe it as an accident. He did, however, reveal that the gate to the property was left open at all times, and that the house had no sprinkler system installed. Intense: Eighty-five firefighters were dispatched to the scene of the early-morning blaze - which still needed attention at midday on Monday . Waterfront home: The blaze, pictured from across the water, was reportedly still being fought at midday on Monday . Before: The 16,000sq ft property boasts two swimming pools and its own courtyard, as well as two outbuildings, one of which is connected to the main house by a covered portion. The image above was taken in 2012 . Inferno: The blaze, pictured from the air, tore through the home. Bottom right, firefighters can be seen standing near the pools as they spray water at the ruins . Wreckage: The home had often been the site of charity gatherings and parties, according to neighbors and local reports . Huge loss: The home, built in 2005 to be a cross between a castle and a beach house, was worth an estimated $9million . Don Pyle grew up in nearby Baltimore County and worked his way to the top table of several billion-dollar tech companies. In a recent interview with the Washington Post, he said he started off as a salesman, and moved to progressively more important roles before taking the reins at companies with links to Silicon Valley. His latest role was as the COO of ScienceLogic, an IT support company based in Reston, Virginia. He would hold fundraisers for worthy causes at his house. At one in 2008, he told the Baltimore Sun the house had been especially designed to be a combination of a castle, his preference and a beach house, which Sandra wanted. His luscious property stood facing Church Creek, a picturesque inlet not far from the Chesapeake Bay. It has an estimated $9million value. Situated on its own portion of exclusive Childs Point Road, the home boasted a courtyard, swimming pool and access to a speedboat jetty. Real estate listings for the home say it had seven bathrooms and was part of a 7.8-acre estate. The modern, two-storey home, which was built in 2005, also has attic space and a basement. Photographs of the mansion before it burned down show at least four cars parked outside the elegant stone construction, which has several turrets as part of its architecture. Though most of the fire appeared to have been extinguished by late Monday morning, some firefighters were still reportedly pouring water on the ruins at midday - almost nine hours after the fire started. Fire chiefs said they were not able to search the house during the blaze, and that it is unlikely they will be able to confirm whether there are any victims until later today. ScienceLogic would only confirm that Pyle works for them. A spokesman told DailyMail.com: 'Don Pyle is the Chief Operating Officer for ScienceLogic. 'There was a fire at his home last night and the case is under investigation. We have no further comment.' Emergency crews: Because the house was nowhere near a fire hydrant, the Anne Arundel County Fire Department deployed a boat to a nearby jetty .","Two unidentified people have been found among the charred remains of an Annapolis-area mansion that burned to the ground on Monday .

"They look innocent enough but these four, every-day items wreak havoc on the average couple’s sex life. Banish them from your bedroom and you’re instantly in store for a year of better, more frequent sex! YOUR TV . Couples who have a TV in their bedroom have sex half as often as those who don’t: that’s a fact, supported by reputable research. Why? It stops you both talking, it robs you of sleep (the better rested we are, the healthier and higher our libido) and it keeps you grounded in reality. By keeping your laptop or iPad in your bedroom you destroy intimacy and distract from sex . God help us all, but reality shows like The Kardashian's suck some people into the trap of thinking what we watch on telly is actually real. It’s not. Sex on telly is peppered with couples having more simultaneous orgasms than cups of tea. In real life, they’re actually pretty rare. Tracey says that in order to have the best sex possible it is wise to choose a firmer bed . All of this leads to unrealistic expectations and constant disappointment with our sex lives. YOUR IPADS AND PHONES . Ditching the telly won’t do a thing if you replace it with another device to distract you from sex and each other. Slip into bed and pull out your ipad or phone and the effect on your relationship is even worse! These gadgets are portable, so capable of destroying intimacy anywhere. Foreplay should begin way before you take your clothes off and if your partner’s spent all night on their phone, giving other people attention, why would you want to give them yours? One recent study found it’s especially harmful if one person uses technology more than the other - the second person feels ignored and insecure. Neither are emotions likely to trigger a bit of rumpy-pumpy. A SOFT, LUMPY BED . The best beds for good sex are firm with no hard edges. You need a firm foundation to master creative sex positions and to be able to sit or lean on the edges without hitting anything hard. Clean, fresh linen is inviting; scratchy, balled-up sheets, not so much (though there is something undeniably sexy about a crumpled bed that you both have just had sex in!). A few firm pillows are perfect for lifting and supporting body bits to make sex super comfy and those more adventurous positions more ‘doable’. SLOPPY SLEEPWEAR . Well-worn, snuggly track pants and wooly socks might make us feel cosy when it’s cold outside, but they do little to get your partner hot and bothered. I’m not suggesting tottering to bed in high heels and sexy stay-up stockings on Monday nights but aiming for a happy medium by choosing something that’s at least a little flattering isn’t too much to ask, surely?

"A photographer is challenging society's views about what makes a glamorous model by transforming real women into beautiful pin-ups. San Francisco native Sophie Spinelle founded Shameless Photography in 2009, with the aim of helping women to 'feel safe, beautiful, and empowered' and has since photographed dozens of subjects. 'Doing this work has transformed my life,' Ms Spinelle told The Huffington Post. 'I've met the most amazing people, and they've been brave enough to share their fears and dreams with me, and to have that become part of the photographs. Scroll down for video . Iconic imagery: Photographer Sophie Spinelle wants women to be able to embrace their bodies and find their own beauty during their shoots . Fire power: During each photoshoot, the women get the chance to have their hair and make-up done professionally . Beautiful people: Ms Spinelle says that too many women 'have no idea' how amazing they are . 'I've learned how rare confidence really is, and how precious. 'You'd be amazed how many truly beautiful people have no idea that they're beautiful, and it has a huge affect on what they feel is possible for their lives.' The Harvard graduate hopes that her photographs will inspire other women to embrace their own beauty, rather than shying away from the cameras or the spotlight. She insists that nobody should not feel as though models and actors are the only people allowed to enjoy the limelight, and during each shoot, she encourages her subjects to embrace an aspect of role play and fantasy. 'The tools of makeup, lighting, and photography can create images that are part fantasy, part reality,' she explains on her website. 'It is a powerful thing to enter the realm of fantasy, and to know that you can do so whenever you choose. No model or movie star owns the realm of fantasy - we all do. Anything is possible: The Shameless Photography team have worked with women from all over the world on a variety of stunning images . Be yourself: The pin-up shoots are aimed at inspiring women to embrace their own bodies and their own beauty, rather than aspiring to look like someone else . Fantasy v reality: According to Ms Spinelle, a lot of women feel that actors and models are the only people who can have fun with fantasy or role play. She wants to change that perception . The perfect bombshell: Ms Spinelle explains on her website that everyone, 'no matter what shape, size, age, color, or ability' can be a model . 'In some small way, we hope that our business can help women to feel more empowered and embodied - and to see femininity as a space of play and possibility rather than shame.' So in order to ensure that every model feels entirely comfortable and confident during their shoot, Ms Spinelle and her team offer a variety of additional services to help each and every person truly step into the pin-up role. 'We’re in this to prove that you can be a bombshell, no matter what shape, size, age, color, or ability,' the website adds. 'We’re here to help every step of the way - from wardrobe to makeup to hair styling to pose and expression coaching - so that you can see your own beauty more clearly.' Shameless Photography also operates an annual Love Your Body contest, which is currently in its fourth year. The competition sees women from around the world writing love letters to their own bodies, which are then posted onto the company's Facebook page, in the hopes of winning the chance to take part in a Shameless photoshoot. Video from BrooklynTheoroughTV . Light up: The women in Ms Spinelle's shoots come from all walks of life, but many admit to lacking confidence when it comes to their appearance .

Transformation: Ms Spinelle told The Huffington Post that her work and the people that she has met through doing her shoots have helped to change her life for the better . Sit! The women involved in each of the shoots are encouraged to be silly and have fun . During the past three years, the team have had letters from a number of different women, all from different walks of life, from cancer survivors to pole dancers, rape victims to trans women. Last year's winner, Amber McDonald, described in her letter her ongoing struggle to try and embrace and love her body for what it - instead of always comparing it to someone that she felt was better or more beautiful than her. 'Dear Body,' she wrote at the start of her letter. 'You have not always been easy to love. 'Or rather, others have not always made it easy to love you. 'You were always too tall, too round, and too fat.' Her letter ended on a positive note however, as she remarked the ways in which she has slowly learned to appreciate her own body for what it is.

"A father and daughter have been banned from keeping animals for life after they crammed 27 pets into their two bedroom semi. Colin Hill, 65, and Lisa Hill, 31, kept the unhealthy animals in terrible conditions in their tiny house in Millfield, Sunderland. The animals were covered in urine and faeces, some were underweight and some were overweight, had dental disease, matted fur and claws that were too long. Colin and Lisa Hill kept the unhealthy cats and dogs in terrible conditions in their tiny house in Millfield, Sunderland . A Jack Russell dog called Bruno was unable to walk properly because his hind legs had turned inwards . The pair had previously admitted causing unnecessary suffering to Border Collie, Patch, and a black and white cat between April and June last year. They also pleaded guilty to four counts of failing to ensure the welfare of a total of five dogs and 22 cats during the same period. The duo were sentenced after the judge had adjourned the case for a pre-sentence report. Appearing at Sunderland Magistrates Court, they were handed a three-months suspended jail term as well as the life time ban. RSPCA prosecutor Denise Jackman said ten-year-old Patch was found when Lisa Hill tried to hide him in her bedroom. The dog was suffering from severe paralysis and his fur was matted and stained with urine and faeces. The cat was found covered in faeces in the rear yard, and its hind legs were so damaged it fell over several times when it tried to stand up. Colin Hill said he had not noticed there was a problem. Both animals were put to sleep. A Jack Russell dog called Bruno was unable to walk properly because his hind legs had turned inwards. One cat was found covered in faeces in the rear yard, and its hind legs were so damaged it fell over several times when it tried to stand up . RSPCA inspectors said they were 'horrified and amazed' at how many animals were kept in the small property (above) Mrs Jackman said RSPCA inspectors described the smell of ammonia in the house as 'intolerable' and that the floor had lifted clue to liquid damage, with the back yard covered in 'layers of faeces'. All of the animals were signed over to the RSPCA. Gavin Sword, defending, said the offences were born out of kindness, the pair having taken in unwanted animals. 'The impression that one gets is that they were simply overwhelmed by the number of animals,' he said. 'This was a two-bedroom house with three adults living in it and nearly 30 animals. It's clearly not adequate. 'When someone had an animal that wasn't wanted they could take it to the Hills. 'Ironically that was done out of kindness and goodness on their part, because they didn't want the alternative. 'They accept in hindsight that they should have sought veterinary attention, and, given their benefits status they could have gone to the PDSA.' Mr Sword said that the pair had been left in fear of vigilante attacks and were scared to go out at night, adding that this had been a punishment in itself. Appearing at Sunderland Magistrates Court, the pair were handed a three-months suspended jail term as well as a life time ban on keeping animals . Suspending the three-month prison sentences for one year, bench chairwoman Jean Brown said the pair would have to wait 10 years before appealing the life time ban on keeping animals. They will be subject to a year's supervision and were ordered to each pay £1,359 in costs, at a rate of £10 per week. Speaking after the case, RSPCA inspector Tony Jackman said: 'I was horrified and amazed at how many animals were in this really small property. There wasn't enough space for them to move around properly. The smell was overpowering.' His colleague Helen Bestwick added: 'The sentence reflects the seriousness of this matter, and for them to get lifetime bans sends out a powerful message that this sort of cruelty will not be tolerated.'","Colin Hill and Lisa Hill kept animals in tiny home in Millfield, Sunderland .

"Get ready ladies, New York's 'cannibal cop' is single and ready to mingle. Disgraced NYPD officer Gilberto Valle, 30, who was found guilty of using police resources to search women for his online abduction and death-porn fantasies, appears to have set up an online dating profile. (He is seeking slender women, who drink moderately, aged 24 -32). He described himself as 'motivated and passionate about working hard', adding: 'I am spending my energy rebounding from the errors I made in my past and rebuilding my life.' He also professes that cooking and dining out are among his interests. Valle has been out of jail since July after being cleared of conspiring to abduct, cook and eat women. His trial included lurid details of how he sought advice from others in the online 'death-porn' community over how to kidnap, kill and eat his wife and friends. Scroll down for video . What a catch! Former NYPD officer Gilberto Valle, dubbed the 'cannibal cop' during his trial for conspiring to abduct, cook and eat women, is available on Match.com . Big appetite: The 30-year-old names one of his hobbies as cooking in his active online dating profile . He was sentenced to time served in November for illegally accessing a federal database. He was also given a year's probation on a charge of misusing police resources to search for women as part of his fantasies. Valle was ordered to continue mental health treatment and was banned from contacting women involved in the case. 'I really want to say I am sorry - it was not a crime but it was wrong,' Valle said outside court in November, . Months later, Valle was back online as 'AmicableOne14'. He explained that his ideal woman is 'non-judgmental' with a 'positive outlook on life', adding: 'You appreciate the simple things and can make the best out of a situation that is less than ideal.' He wrote that he works in sales and marketing, is divorced and has a child who lives away from home. His political views are noted as conservative and his last read was 'The Art of Thinking Clearly' by Rolf Dobelli. Among the pictures on the dating profile include several images with a woman cropped out, but still partially visible, another of him petting a dog and a snap of a karaoke performance. There is even a shot which appears to be Valle walking into a court appearance being chased by TV cameras and photographers. Although the profile appears to be genuine, Valle claimed that he didn't know anything about it, when asked by the New York Post. However, when shown his Match.com profile, he added: 'I don’t want to see it, thanks.' Daily Mail Online was awaiting a comment from Match.com on Wednesday. Looking for love: The disgraced cop has been out of jail since July but is still on probation for misusing police resources to search for women in his fantasies . Valle explained that his ideal woman is 'non-judgmental' with a 'positive outlook on life', in his Match.com dating profile . During his trial, the jury heard how Valle communicated in chat rooms about killing and cooking his wife. He told one man he met in a fetish chat room: 'I want her to experience being cooked alive. She'll be trussed up like a turkey. ... She'll be terrified, screaming and crying.' In another exchange, Valle suggested a woman he knew would be easy prey because she lived alone. The chat room discussion centered on cooking the victim, basted in olive oil, over an open fire and using her severed head as a centerpiece for a sit-down meal. Valle had been facing life in prison but the charges were thrown out in July, with the judge writing that ' more likely than not the case that all of Valle's Internet communications about kidnapping are fantasy role-play'. Valle, 30, (pictured outside court in November) was cleared of conspiring to kidnap, kill, cook and eat women but put on a year's probation for misusing police resources to search for woman for his fantasies . The former cop's defense lawyers said Valle recognized that the substance of his Internet chats was 'deeply troubling and disturbing' and now meets weekly with a counselor to discuss it. They added: 'Gil does not want his life's legacy to be the story of the ''Cannibal Cop.'' 'He is only 30 years old and intends to make something more out of his life. Inspired by the team of people who defended his innocence, Gil wants to go to law school.' Valle, then a patrolman for the NYPD, was arrested in October 2012 after his wife found disturbing pictures on his computer that he had downloaded from the site DarkFetishNet.com. The FBI found a list of 100 women he said he planned to kill, cook and eat. They also found a transcript of an online chat in which he said he planned to take his 'girlfriend' Kathleen to Pakistan, where he and another man would murder her and cannibalize her body. Valle maintains that his extensive writings were nothing more than fantasy - never meant to be acted on or carried out. Valle's ex-wife, who testified against her husband at trial, was granted a divorce last July. She took the couple's young daughter and completely cut off contact with Valle and his family. Gilberto Valle, an NYPD patrolman, was fired from the department, after being arrested over his disturbing Internet chats .","Gilberto Valle, 30, appears to have set up an online dating profile (seeking slender women, who drink moderately, aged 24 -32)

"A great-grand-father died the day he turned 100 – as his family sang him Happy Birthday. Sidney Doel had invited loved ones including some of his 14 great-grandchildren to lunch at his care home, in Plymouth, to mark the milestone. But as they waited for the meal he became unwell and died peacefully in bed as they crowded round to sing to him. Sidney Doel (pictured) had invited loved ones including some of his 14 great-grandchildren to lunch at his care home, in Plymouth, to mark the milestone . His death was so sudden that he did not even get to read his special card from the Queen, who sent him her best wishes.  His son Eric Doel, 56, said: ‘It was the nicest way for dad to go.’ Mr Doel was born in Plymouth on January 11, 1915 and lived with his father Charlie Doel, a Royal Marine, mother Edith Doel, and five siblings. When he was 18 he joined the regular Army and served for 13 years, reaching the rank of corporal, before going on to serve in the Territorial Army. His aptitude and courage during the Second World War won him four medals - the 1939-1945 Star, the Africa Star, the War Medal 1939-1945 and the Defence Medal.

"Suspect in custody: Christopher Miller is the man Canadian police allegedly arrested this morning in connection to a chemical threat in Nova Scotia . The ex-husband of decorated U.S. Olympic gymnast Shannon Miller was arrested Wednesday morning in connection to a chemical weapons threat in Nova Scotia. Royal Canadian Mounted Police refused to identify the suspect who was apprehended at a hotel in Ottowa on Wednesday, but Miller's business manager confirmed the wanted man was her ex-husband Christopher Phillips, an American former biochemical weapons expert. The hunt for Phillips began Tuesday after police found large quantities of dangerous chemicals at two Nova Scotia homes connected to his family. His current wife warned police that he was on his way to Ottowa, about a 14 hour drive west, in a van that could possibly be packed with even more hazardous materials. A Canada-wide alert issued Tuesday night stated that the suspect was an ex-military weapons specialist with possible mental-health issues. After Phillips van was spotted in the parking lot of an Ottowa hotel Tuesday night, the building was evacuated and he was arrested without incident the following morning. A subsequent search found no chemicals at the hotel or in his van. Authorities still don't know what Phillips was doing in Ottowa or what he may have planned to do with the chemicals found in the two Nova Scotia homes. He has not yet been charged with a crime. Divorced: Canadian authorities have not yet formally identified the suspect, but decorated U.S. Olympic gymnast Shannon Miller confirmed today that the man is her ex-husband Christopher Phillips (the former couple pictured on their wedding day in June 1999) Dangerous: An arrest warrant was issued for Phillips Wednesday morning after hazardous materials were found at two properties connected to his family in  Nova Scotia, and his wife called police to inform them that he was travelling to Ottowa. Above, a member of the RCMP  explosive disposal unit prepares to enter a residence in Cole Harbour, a Halifax suburb, on Tuesday . Stockpiles: The above cottage in Grand Desert is one of  two homes where authorities found hazarous chemicals. Firefighters and other emergency personnel seen gathered around the building on Wednesday. Authorities would not say what type of chemical was found inside, or how much . Arrested: Phillips was tracked down to a hotel in Ottowa on Tuesday night, and he surrendered to poice without incident the following morning - his 42nd birthday. Ambulances and police are shown at the scene on Wednesday . 'The investigation is ongoing so it's difficult to comment, but certainly there's been no information received to this point that there's any terrorist intention,' Ottowa police Inspector John McGetrick said Wednesday afternoon. Phillips, an American, married U.S. Olympic gymnast Shannon Miller in June 1999, three years after she won two gold medals at the 1996 Atlanta, Georgia Olympics. However, they separated in 2004 and officially divorced in 2006 and Phillips later moved to Canada. 'I'm thankful that the brave men and women of the Ottawa police department and other law enforcement agencies were able to apprehend him and (defuse) the situation without incident,' Miller said in a statement released by her manager, Nick Furris. Miller now works as a motivational speaker. Decorated athlete: Phillips and Miller have been divorced since 2006.

Champion: Miller won two gold medals at the 1996 Atlanta, Georgia Olympics. Pictured above practicing her floor exercises at the games . Police in Nova Scotia were first alerted to a possible threat Monday night around 9:20pm when they received a call about a suspicious package at a local home. They went on to investigate three homes connected to Phillips in two neighborhoods which were evacuated over the dangerous materials thought to be inside. Of the three buildings searched Tuesday, 'hazardous and volatile' materials were found in two - one home on Lakeridge Crescent owned by Phillips' current wife Gosia Phillips and a cottage on Dyke Road registered to a Marian Sue Phillips of El Reno, Oklahoma. It's unclear the relationship between Marian and the suspect. 'The chemicals are of a nature that we need to employ a chemist to help us identify what type of chemicals that they are,' RCMP Corporal Greg Churcd said of the materials found in the cottage. Police would not elaborate on how many chemicals were found, or what type. However, residents in  the Grand Desert neighborhood of the Dyke Road cottage remained evacuated Wednesday evening. Suiting up: A member of  the RCMP explosive disposal unit prepares to enter a residence in Cole Harbour, a Halifax suburb, on Tuesday. Police evacuated homes within 100 meters of the house after finding a suspicious package . Family connections: Another home registered to Phillips' wife Gosia on Lakeridge Road was found with chemicals as well. Above, the cottage on Dyke Road where 'large quantities' of chemicals were found and a mass evacuation was issued . Leaving: Residents in Cole Harbour flee their homes with a few belongings on Tuesday after reports of a suspicious package at a local home . Do not disturb: Those staying at the Chimo Hotel (pictured above) were told to quietly leave their rooms Tuesday night after it was suspected Phillips might have brought chemicals into the building. No hazardous materials were found, but police were able to apprehend Phillips staying in one of the rooms . Gosia Phillips allegedly told police that her husband was en route to Ottowa in a Chevy cube van, that was feared to be packed with even more dangerous chemicals. Police issued a Canada-wide alert for the van Tuesday night, saying the suspect driver was an ex-military weapons specialist with possible mental health issues and an 'anti-police' attitude. 'Person reported to have mental health issues/PTSD and has issues with law enforcement personnel. Person may have chemicals or hazardous materials in the vehicle,' the report read. It was later revealed that police believed Phillips was carrying the chemicals osmium and osmium tetroxide in his van. The lab chemicals are highly dangerous and can easily penetrate the skin. About a decade ago, the chemicals were feared as a possible terrorist weapon. Around 10pm, an Ottowa police officer spotted a van matching the description in the parking lot of the Chimo Hotel. All of the guests were called and told to quietly evacuate so police could search the building for chemicals and the suspect. Authorities also closed down several roads surrounding the hotel as a precaution. Phillips was apprehended the following morning - his 42nd birthday - without incident from a room on the sixth floor of the hotel. Police finished searching the building and Phillips' van later that afternoon without finding any chemicals. Phillips LinkedIn page shows a diverse academic background with advanced degrees in medicine, law and business. Re-married: Phillips pictured above in a picture posted to Facebook. He is reportedly married to Harvard University-educated a sleep doctor named Gosia Phillips . He studied medicine at the University of Oklahoma and Boston University before pursuing opthamology at the University of Texas. He also has a law degree and MBA from Suffolk University. It has been reported that Phillips was a former biomedical weapons expert for the U.S. Army. However, the U.S. military says they have no record of Phillips, though the records only date back to 1999. His LinkedIn page lists his current job as the manager of Neurology and Sleep Medicine Associates Inc, which was searched Tuesday and found to contain no hazardous materials. His wife Gosia Phillips is equally accomplished. She attended Harvard University and is a specialist in sleep medicine, in addition to teaching medicine at Dalhousie University. Records show that Gosia Phillips changed her name from Malgorzata Ewa Klonowska in February 2010. Before he moved to Canada and married Gosia, Phillips' career appears to have been plagued by complaints of botched surgeries. The Washington State Health Department investigated Phillips over several complaints from former patients at his laser eye care clinic and he eventually agreed not to renew his expired license to practice. And in 2008, Phillips reportedly stopped going to work because of psychiatric issues. According to a documents obtained by the Ottowa Citizen, Phillips was hospitalized between March 3 and March 7, 2008 and March 22 and April 18, 2008 for an unknown psychiatric diagnosis. 'The records from this hospitalization contain diagnoses which would make it very difficult or impossible for (Phillips) to obtain employment as an expert witness,' the documents state. Nova Scotia court records also show that Phillips was charged for uttering threats and possession of a weapon between December 26 and Wednesday.","The Royal Canadian Mounted Police arrested the suspect Wednesday morning, but have not yet publicly confirmed his identity .

"David Cameron today admitted he sounded 'very old' after telling a radio station that he could not understand 'why everybody is interested in the Kardashians' - and preferred Brian Ferry to pop stars Jay Z and Iggy Azalea. The Prime Minister told Capital Xtra DJ Andre Morgan he should call him 'Dave' for the interview, aiming to reach out to younger voters. Mr Cameron was quizzed on youth unemployment, the Chilcot inquiry and the number of black students going to university. But he was caught out after the presenter began testing him on his knowledge of reality TV, pop music and chain restaurants. The DJ said said: ‘We’ve all want a very cool Prime Minister, because we’ve got a cool American President and I’m sure we can have a cool Prime Minister.' David Cameron today claimed he did not understand the appeal of the reality show Keeping Up With The Kardashians, starring Kim Kardashian (right) The DJ said he wanted to 'test' the Prime Minister's 'knowledge on a few things'. Mr Morgan presented the Prime Minister with a scenario in which he had finished Prime Minister's Questions and was at home watching TV but only reality shows were on. ‘Which one do you watch? Big Brother, Love and Hip Hop or Keeping up with the Kardashians?’ Mr Cameron was asked. Mr Cameron responded: ‘I’m not a big brother fan. I have watched it. I haven’t quite got into why everybody is interested in the Kardashians, so maybe I’ll try the hip hop show – that sounds a bit better. ‘I like watching cooking programmes – I find that relaxing.’ Mr Morgan then asked the PM about his music favourites. The Prime Minister posed for a selfie with Nandos diner Becky Smith after visiting the restaurant in Bristol . The Prime Minister tucked into half a chicken, chips, coleslaw - washed down with a glass of red wine - in a Nandos in Bristol  last year . The PM said he preferred 70s pop star Brian Ferry (left) to the hip hop giant Jay Z (left) The DJ said: ‘Barack Obama suggests you need a big artist to put together your campaign track to claw back the youth vote. ‘He suggests he’s going to bring in Jay Z for you. Prime Minister Tony Abbot calls from Australia to say Iggy Azalea is the way forward. Or do you go safe and call up Tinie Tempah to get the UK track?’ Mr Cameron said: ‘The track I would like to have – but this makes me sound so old – is ‘Let’s Stick Together’ by Brian Ferry because I think that’s the message for the election. In his final scenario, the radio presenter said to Mr Cameron: ‘Everyone is over for the G7 summit and it’s up to you to order lunch. ‘Do you order Harvester, A Gordon Ramsay pub or do you get some chicken in from Nandos?’ Mr Cameron said: ‘I’ve been to a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, I’ve been to Nandos and I’ve been to a Harvester. I think Nandos is the best value for money. I had a very good Nandos in Bristol.’","David Cameron admitted his answers made him sound 'very old'

"The divorce between hedge fund billionaire Kenneth Griffin and his soon to be ex-wife Anne Dias Griffin has taken another nasty turn. In court papers filed on Tuesday, Dias Griffin is claiming she has been banned from all of the couple's marital residences, including homes in New York City, Aspen and Miami, and that she will not longer have free run over Chicago home she was promised half of  in their prenup. Furthermore, she says he husband will commit to no financial support 'on paper' but will give her money 'off paper' as long as she is a 'good girl.' Dias Griffin is also claiming that she has been shouldering all the expenses for them couple's three children. Scroll down for video .

She is fighting for more of his fortune . Honeymoon is over: The couple married at Versailles (above) with a performance by Donna Summer . 'Kenneth should be required to pay monthly child support to cover all of the children's expenses, fixed overhead expenses for the household, as well as child care, security, household and administrative staff, who should be reporting to Anne and under her control, not Kenneth's,' Dias Griffin said in her filing, which was obtained by the Chicago Tribune. A rep for Griffin said the money man 'focused on the well-being of his children, and that has guided his every decision.' They then added; 'He has willingly paid all reasonable, and frankly, many unreasonable expenses throughout the separation, including millions in cash to Anne and a $10 million gift to Harvard in Anne's name. But when Anne takes things to a ridiculous level of extravagance and demands things like a $450,000 vacation to St. Bart's, enough is enough.' Griffin, who is fighting to only pay his wife what the two agreed on in their pre-nup as part of a messy divorce, says his estranged spouse has already received $35 million in the break-up. The CEO of $20 billion Chicago-based investment giant Citadel LLC  agreed to pay his wife $25 million in their prenup, plus $1 million for each year they were married. Having split after 11 years, Anne Dias Griffin has already accrued $35 million and has a reported net worth of $50 million, according to the newspaper. However the settlement would leave her with no real estate titles or any of the couple's costly possessions, including an extensive art collection.

She is seeking full-time custody. Griffin's worth is estimated to be around $5.6 billion. He founded the hedge fund Citadel LLC in 1990. Dias Griffin claims she was coerced into signing the prenup, and has filed a petition with the court saying she did not have a chance to fully read the document before agreeing to it back in 2003.

The duties of the guardian ad litem include investigating the facts of the case, interviewing the children, their parents, and other relevant parties, and submitting a written report to the court. Levin has previously worked with the children of famous actors and athletes.

"Adnan Syed was convicted of killing his ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee in 2000 when he was 18 . 'Serial' may be over, but the true-crime case that gripped the nation seems far from shut after Asia McClain  yesterday reasserted she was with convicted murderer Adnan Syed at the exact time Baltimore prosecutors said he killed his ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee in 1999. In an affidavit published by the The Blaze, Ms McClain stated that she now realized 'her importance to the case' and felt she needed to make her story 'known to the court system'. 'The Asia letters' were first revealed on the popular podcast 'Serial', which followed longtime radio producer and former Baltimore Sun reporter Sarah Koenig's year-long investigation into Syed's case. The 12-episode series became a national obsession with over five million downloads as people tuned in every Thursday to listen as Ms Koening reported her findings in almost real-time hour-long segments. In one such segment it was reported that Ms McClain had written Syed two letters following his arrest, stating that he had been in the public library near their high school on the day Ms Lee was murdered. Prosecutors claimed Ms Lee had been dead by 2.36pm, but Ms McClain stated she remembered talking with Syed from 2.20 to 2.40pm. Ms McClain, now 33, did not stand as a witness in Syed's 2000 trial, where he was convicted of first-degree murder and given a life sentence plus 30 years. She said she was never contacted by his defense attorney Cristina Guttierrez, and she did not write an affidavit until  Syed's family friend Rabia Chaudry approached her after the trial. In a new affidavit key alibi witness Asia McClain reasserted her claim that she had been in the library with Syed at time prosecutors said Ms Lee (right in a yearbook photo) was murdered . 13 January 1999: Hae Min Lee, a senior at Woodlawn High School, vanishes . 9 February: A man who stopped for an emergency bathroom break finds Hae's body in a shallow grave in a Baltimore city park . 12 February: An anonymous tip-off tells police to look at Adnan Syed as a suspect . 18 February: Police seize his cell phone records . 27 February: Jennifer Pusateri tells detectives Jay Wilds told her that Syed killed Hae . 28 February: Syed is arrested hours after Wilds shows police Hae's car . 7 September: Wilds pleads guilty to accessory after the fact to first degree murder . 15 December: Syed's first trial is declared a mistrial . 25 February 2000: Syed is convicted of first degree murder . 6 June: Syed begins life plus 30 years sentence . 2003: Review of case but conviction remains . 2012: Second review does not find in Syed's favor . 3 October 2014: First episode of Serial . Syed, now 34, brought up the 'Asia letters' during a 2012 appeal hearing, but the case's original prosecutor Kevin Urick testified that Ms McClain had called him and said the affidavit was written under pressure from Syed's family. Ms McClain refutes this claim in her new affidavit. 'I never told Urick that I recanted my story or affidavit about January 13, 1999,' it states. 'In addition, I did not write the March 1999 letters or the affidavit because of pressure from Syed's family.' Ms McClain has claimed she was unsure what to do after she was contacted by Syed's defense team in 2010 and was unaware of 'how weak' the state's case was in regard to their evidence and testimony. McClain also claimed that she called  Mr Urick to get more information about how to proceed and he convinced her not to participate in any legal proceedings. It was only after she listened to 'Serial' and heard what Ms Koening had discovered that Ms McClain realized her importance to the case and decided to contact Syed's current lawyer to state her story in court, she told The Baltimore Sun. Mr Urick, now a private attorney, said on Tuesday that he stood by his 2012 testimony and that he had never tried to convince Ms McClain not to testify on behalf of Syed - although he did say he had told her that the evidence against Syed was 'strong'.

Ms McClain also alleged that Kevin Urick, the original prosecutor of the case, convinced her not to testify in a crucial appeals hearing for Syed in 2012 . Ms McClain also refuted Mr Urick's claim that she had told him she wrote her original affidavit (pictured) under pressure from Syed's family . This month a Baltimore City Circuit Court denied Syed's most recent appeal, which stated that his attorney Ms Gutierrez had neglected to reach out to Ms McClain as a key witness. The court said this 'was the result of a sound and reasonable defense strategy'  both because Ms McClain's letters did not specify the time she saw Syed in the library, and because they contradicted his version of events that day. Syed has appealed the circuit court’s decision to the Maryland Court of Special Appeals.","Asia McClain reasserted in new affidavit she was in library with Adnan Syed at time his ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee was murdered in 1999 .

"A 22-month-old girl from Mexico is the latest to be hit by a measles outbreak traced to Disney theme parks in California. The unidentified infant, who was not vaccinated, apparently visited the tourist attraction with family from December 16 to 18. There are now 42 patients who have been struck down by the viral disease including five Disney employees. New case: A 22-month-old girl from Mexico is the latest to be hit by a measles outbreak traced to Disney theme parks in California (stock image) Of the workers at Disneyland and Disney California Adventure in Anaheim, three have fully recovered and returned to work, and two remain off, said Dr. Pamela Hymel, the chief medical officer for Walt Disney Parks and Resorts. All of Disney's 'cast members,' as it calls park employees, have been offered immunity tests and vaccinations since the company first heard of the outbreak January 7, Hymel said. Those who have been in close contact with infected employees are put on paid leave until their immunity can be established. Several dozen measles cases have emerged in California, four other states and Mexico in the outbreak linked to December visits to Disney theme parks in Orange County. Oregon became the latest state affected Tuesday when state officials confirmed that a Eugene man in his 40s had contracted the disease after visiting Disney parks. Orange County has confirmed 18 cases there in the past month, though six were not connected to the theme parks, said its health agency spokeswoman Deanne Thompson. At nearby Huntington Beach High School, at least 23 unvaccinated students have been sent home after a student was confirmed to be infected with measles. Students without a measles vaccination were told to stay home until January 29 to avoid a spread of the disease that has symptoms including fever and a blotchy body rash. State law requires schoolchildren to get vaccinated to protect against measles, mumps and rubella, but parents can get an exemption by signing a personal belief waiver. Disney ties: Most of the patients visited Disneyland (pictured) or Disney California Adventure between Dec. 15 and Dec. 20, but some may have contracted the illness from others who visited . Many parents who reject vaccines or delay them fear there are links between the vaccines and medical conditions such as autism. Numerous studies have dismissed an autism link. 'It is at large in the community now, and particularly infants too young to be immunized, people with other health conditions and, of course, people who aren't immunized need to be very concerned,' Thompson said. She added that unvaccinated people 'really should rethink that and consider getting vaccinated.' Measles is a highly contagious virus that lives in an infected person's nose and throat mucus and spreads through coughing and sneezing, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes and a red rash that usually first appears on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. Health experts say the best prevention against measles is vaccination. While officials declared measles eliminated in the U.S. in 2000 because of a lack of continuous transmission, the illness is still brought into the country by foreign visitors or unvaccinated Americans.","The unidentified infant, who was not vaccinated, apparently visited the tourist attraction with family from December 16 to 18 .

"Samsung is set to start making its own smartphone chips in a bid to move ahead of Apple in the smartphone wars. The firm will not use Qualcomm Inc's processors for the next version of the South Korean technology giant's flagship Galaxy S smartphone, Bloomberg claims, citing unidentified sources. Samsung, the world's No.1 smartphone maker, has been one of the U.S. company's top customers. Samsung's latest handset, the  Galaxy Alpha. The firm is set to use its own chips in new handsets, it has been claimed . Previous leaks from BGR say the SM-G925F, the codename believed to be assigned to the Galaxy S6, will feature a Quad HD (2560 x 1440 resolution) 5.5inch display. It will also have an octa-core processor, Mali-T768 graphics processing unit, and a 16-megapixel rear-facing camera. The handset is expected to be unveiled at Mobile World Congress, a trade show in Barcelona, which takes place from 2-5 March. However, Qualcomm's new Snapdragon 810 chip overheated during Samsung's testing, Bloomberg reported. The South Korean company will use its own processors instead, Bloomberg said. Such an outcome would be a blow for Qualcomm's prospects for 2015, with the company already having guided for weaker-than-usual annual revenue growth in a five-year outlook issued in November. A Qualcomm spokesman declined to comment on the report. A Samsung spokeswoman said the company does not comment on rumours. Analysts have said the Snapdragon 810 chip has been dealing with a variety of performance issues that may not be corrected in time for the launch of Samsung's next Galaxy S smartphone. The South Korean firm is widely expected to unveil the device on the sidelines of the Mobile World Congress trade show in early March, and according to GSM Arena it will be unveiled on March 2nd. Samsung will need to ensure that the phone does not disappoint in order to keep its global market share from slipping further, analysts said. Samsung has already used its own Exynos processors in flagship devices such as the Galaxy S5 to some extent, though analysts said Qualcomm's Snapdragon chips were more widely used. Greater adoption of Exynos chips in Samsung smartphones would help boost sales for the struggling foundry business. 'Samsung will likely show off the new Galaxy S phone in about a month and a half, so one would have to assume that the chips have been tested a fair amount in order for them to be used,' said HMC Investment analyst Greg Roh. Apple already designs its own chips - some of which are made by Samsung . Successful deployment of Exynos chips in flagship Samsung smartphones will help burnish the company's credentials as a chip designer and manufacturer, Roh said. This could help its foundry business attract more orders from the likes of Apple Inc, he said. Earlier this week it was claimed Samsung's next generation Galaxy handset could have a curved screen that covers both its sides. The handset, which is expected to have a 5.5inch screen, will come in a 'special edition' version with the curved technology, according to Sammobile. The Korean giant believes its curved technology could give it an edge over arch rival Apple. A Samsung Galaxy Note E, the first to use Samsung's curved screen. It is claimed the Galaxy S6 could come in a special edition with both sides featuring the technology. The handset is expected to be unveiled at Mobile World Congress, a trade show in Barcelona, which takes place from 2-5 March. 'Today, we can confirm that Samsung is indeed developing a Galaxy S6 with two-edge displays, one on each side, reports our source,' said the Sammobile site. The curved screen has already been used  in Samsung's Note Edge. However, S6 Edge will have the ability to work in a left or right handed mode . 'You will have an option to choose favourite contacts and an ability to assign specific colours to them,' explained Sammobile. 'So, calls and notifications from important people will show the designated color lighting on the edge area.' Previous leaks from BGR say the SM-G925F — the codename believed to be assigned to the Galaxy S6 — will feature a Quad HD (2560 x 1440 resolution) display, octa-core processor, Mali-T768 graphics processing unit, and a 16-megapixel rear-facing camera. Earlier this month, in the face of stiff competition, and following a consecutive drop in profits, Samsung announced plans to curb the number of phones it makes each year. Instead of releasing handset after handset and saturating the market with Samsung devices, the firm has decided it needs to concentrate on making fewer handsets, better. The South Korean manufacturer is also expected to ramp up production of its remaining models so they can be sold more cheaply. In the face of stiff competition, and following a consecutive drop in profits, Samsung has announced plans to curb the number of phones  it makes each year by between a quarter and a third. Instead of saturating the market with Samsung devices, the firm has decided it needs to concentrate on making fewer handsets, better . The strategy was unveiled during a presentation in New York by Samsung's head of investor relations, Robert Yi. He said the company would reduce the number of smartphone models in 2015 by between a quarter and a third. In a rare acknowledgement, Mr Yi added that Samsung had lagged behind changing market conditions. Analysts claim the bigger iPhones  (shown) will likely take away customers who favoured Samsung Galaxy's larger screens. In emerging markets, such as India and China, Samsung's smartphone sales have been overtaken by local rivals . The company's response 'was not quick enough,' said Mr Yi. In emerging markets, such as India and China, Samsung's smartphone sales were overtaken by local rivals. 'Rather than seeking stability, Samsung should seek to distinguish [its phones] with Galaxy's design policies,' Lee Seung-woo, an analyst at IBK Securities said. The company moved the launch of the Galaxy Note 4, a large smartphone with a stylus, to late September from October after Apple unveiled the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. It also began sales of the Galaxy Note 4 in China last month, getting an early start in the world's most populous country before Apple.","Will abandon long term partner Qualcomm processors for Galaxy S6 .

"A travellers' site built in an 'unsuitable' location has reopened after a £1million taxpayer-funded refurbishment was needed because  it was 'trashed'. The Timberlands site, in Pepperstock, just south of Luton, Bedfordshire, closed in 2012 after it fell into such disrepair children living there were forced to walk through sewage. Almost three years after it was shut down it has reopened with six new pitches costing more than £150,000 each. The new permanent homes - which all have solar-powered buildings and CCTV - already have new families inside, who say they are thrilled to be there. Revamp: This travellers' site near Luton has been rebuilt in a £1million taxpayer-funded project after it was 'trashed' Contrat: The Timberlands site, in Pepperstock, just south of Luton, Bedfordshire closed in 2012 after it fell into such disrepair children living there were forced to walk through sewage . One local resident, who asked not to be named, said: 'It's been closed for months while travellers had nowhere to go and now we find out almost £1million has been spent doing it up. 'It looks very nice but it's a lot of money considering it just got trashed last time.' The local council said the site, which reopened on Monday, already has residents and they expect all six homes to be fully occupied soon. They have spent £931,000 on the revamp, with pictures of the site in 2012 showing how the site had been destroyed and abandoned. Three years ago the doors had been ripped off, the buildings were in serious disrepair and the site itself was overgrown. Today, resident Karen Witney - a mother of three - said: 'The properties are absolutely brilliant and lovely and clean.' Karen moved recently from Leicestershire and now rents one of the bungalows, which stand on a site which is warden controlled and with a secured gated entrance. She said 'The homes are more for gypsy families and they have a living area, a kitchen and a bathroom with a shower. All the fittings are UVPC and there's even a solar panel in the roof. It's brilliant'. Rosy Penman, a local villager, said 'I really hope they are nice people. In the past, there were problems with the children living on the site.' Fresh start: Families are already moving into the site, which has six permanent properties . Spot the difference: The council has spent £931,000 on the revamp including double glazing and solar panels, with pictures of the site in 2012 showing how the site had been destroyed and abandoned, right . On the last occasion the site was given a refurb, pipes and fittings were ripped out of a washroom within weeks. Litter was dumped in fields around the site and bottles thrown at horses. Despite the new improvements local councillor Richard Stay criticised the cost and location of the development. He said: 'When it closed in 2012 it was a scandal, there were children walking around in open sewage'. 'It had to be closed. But it's in an unsuitable place, given that there are elderly and disabled people who live nearby. 'We received a grant from the government for use on travellers' sites but it was specific to this location, despite there being far more suitable locations.' A spokesman for Central Bedfordshire Council said: 'The site opened last week to allow people to begin moving on ahead of the tenancy start date (on Monday). Six households will be in occupation with most having already moved in successfully last week'.","Site was shut down in 2012 after 'children forced to walk through sewage'
