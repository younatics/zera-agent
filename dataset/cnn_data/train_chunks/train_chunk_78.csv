"(CNN)  -- Hosts Angola were denied victory by an incredible Mali comeback to force a 4-4 draw in the opening match of the troubled Africa Cup of Nations in Luanda on Sunday. Angola appeared headed for an emphatic victory when they led 4-0 with only 16 minutes remaining before Mali produced one of the most remarkable recoveries in the history of the competitive football. Barcelona's Seydou Keita with a double, a brilliant Frederic Kanoute header and finally, deep into injury time, the equalizer from substitute Mustapha Yatabare completed the great escape. The dramatic match went ahead against the tragic backdrop of the murderous machine gun attack on the Togo team bus in Cabinda on Friday, which left two dead and several injured. Angolan president Jose Eduardo dos Santos issued a rallying call in his speech to mark the official opening of the competition, which was attended by several heads of state, including South Africa's Jakob Zuma whose country hosts the World Cup finals later this year. ""Despite the terrorist attack, Cabinda will remain a hosting city,"" he said. ""There is no need to be afraid."" After the speeches and fireworks, Angola proceeded to do their country proud with a dominant first half perfomance against a desperately disappointing Mali side, who were one of the pre-tournament favorites. Flavio Armado put them two ahead by the break with headed goals in the 36th and 42nd minutes. Mali pressed hard at the start of the second half with their captain Mahamadou Diarra denied by a point-blank save, but their efforts were undermined when they conceded a 65th minute penalty which Gilberto converted at the second attempt. Gilberto was then brought down by Keita to concede another soft penalty and Manucho slotted home the fourth to send the home fans in the 11th of November stadium wild with delight. Their appeared little danger when Keita scrambled the ball home in the 79th minute from a corner and alarm bells were still to ring when Sevilla striker Kanoute at last showed his quality with an 88th-minute second goal. But Keita struck a third on the stroke of nomal time and with Angola's defense in total disarray it was left to Yatabare to make a name for himself with the leveler.","Hosts Angola and Mali draw 4-4 in opening match of 27th Africa Cup of Nations .

"(CNN)  -- Bordeaux clinched the French league title with a 1-0 win over Caen on a dramatic final day of the season. Bordeaux's fans celebrate their first French league title in 10 years. Laurent Blanc's men were ending Lyon's seven-year hold on the domestic championship and winning Bordeaux's first title in 10 years. A goal from Yoan Gouffran early in the second half secured their 11th straight win and their second trophy of the season having won the French League Cup in April. The defeat saw Caen drop to the second flight and kept Bordeaux three points clear of second-placed Marseille who won 4-0 at home to Rennes to keep up the pressure to the last. Senegal international striker Mamadou Niang scored twice with Ivory Coast star  Bakari Kone also on target, but it was not enough. Lyon closed their season with a 0-0 draw at Toulouse and their third place finish secures a place in the qualifying round for the Champions League. Once mighty Nantes also went down despite a 2-1 win over Auxerre, but St.Etienne stayed up with a 4-0 win over Valenciennes. In the Spanish Primera Liga, Atletico Madrid thrashed Almeria 3-0 to clinch a spot in the Champions League next season. Diego Forlan all but sealed the honor of finishing top scorer in the league with the opener for Atletico, his 32nd of the season, by rounding off the scoring for Atletico. Sergio Aguero, reportedly a target for Premier League Chelsea, gave them a 19th-minute lead with Raul Garcia scoring the second. The win draws Atletico level on points with third placed Sevilla, who close their season, but staying two points clear of fifth-placed Villarreal, 3-2 winners over Real Mallorca in their final match. European champions Barcelona, who had already clinched the Spanish title, finished their season with a 1-1 draw at Deportivo La Coruna. Rodolfo Bodipo put Depo ahead in the first half with Samuel Eto'o equalizing with a minute left. It leaves Barcelona with a record tally of 87 points from 38 points, well clear of arch-rivals and deposed champions Real Madrid. Besiktas won the Turkish league title with a 2-1 win over Denizlispor as nearest rivals Sivasspor lost 2-1 to last year's champions Galatasaray. It was the 11th championship for Besiktas, but first since 2003. They also won the Turkish Cup.","Bordeaux beat relegated Caen 1-0 to clinch the French league title .

"CNN -- Lionel Messi is universally recognized as being one of football's greatest current players and the Argentine, who does not turn 22 until June, will have a captive world-wide audience watching his every move when he dons the famous red and blue Barcelona shirt for Wednesday's Champions League final against Manchester United. Lionel Messi has finished second in FIFA's World Player of the Year award two years in a row. Messi burst onto the world stage in 2003 when he made his debut, as a raw 16-year-old, in a friendly against Portuguese side Porto -- and since then he has become the natural heir-apparent to Argentine legend Diego Maradona. Born in Rosario, Argentina, in 1987, a year after Maradona almost single-handidly won the World Cup for his country in Mexico, Messi's talent was obvious at a very early age. He joined Argentine club Newell's Old Boys aged just eight, where he stayed until he joined Barcelona's under-14 squad in 2000. With Barcelona he has already won three league championships, two Spanish Super cups, the Copa del Rey and the Champions League. On the international stage he has won the Under-20 World Cup with Argentina in 2005, while being voted player of tournament and making his mark as the tournament's leading goalscorer. He made his debut for the senior team aged 18 and played a leading role in the side that won a gold medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. According to Forbes magazine, Messi was football's sixth-richest earner in 2008. Of his $18 million income, only a relatively small $7m came from endorsements. Maradona, now coach of the Argentine national side, has described Messi as ""beautiful to watch,"" adding ""he has something different to any other player in the world."" Messi has scored eight times in this year's Champions League and is odds-on to become the competition's leading scorer -- and a winning goal in Rome on Wednesday will add the icing on the cake in what has been a superb season for both Messi and Barca. Messi's outstanding performances during the 2007/2008 season earned him second place in voting for European Footballer of the Year and FIFA World Player of the Year honors, both times being beaten by Cristiano Ronaldo. However, if he helps Barcelona add the Champions League to their La Lia and Copa del Rey crowns this season, he is likely to go one better when this year's awards are handed out.","Lionel Messi has already helped Barca to the La Liga and Copa del Rey titles .

"(CNN) -- Malawi stunned Algeria 3-0 at a near-deserted November 11 stadium in Luanda as the unpredictable start to the African Nations Cup continued. Algeria began the Group A match as clear favorites, but were 2-0 down by half-time thanks to goals from Russel Mwafulirwa and Elvis Kafoteka. Dave Banda added a third after 49 minutes to end any thoughts of an Algeria comeback. Sunday's 4-4 draw between hosts Angola and Mali did not appear to have captured the public's imagination as the players kicked off in front of rows and rows of empty seats. An early angled strike from Abdelkader Ghezzal was saved by Malawi goalkeeper Swadick Sanudi after five minutes. Ghezzal had another chance moments later but could not find the target. After eight minutes, Russel found a yard in the Algeria box but headed wide under pressure from Madjid Bougherra. Malawi surprised their opponents in the 17th minute when they took the lead in somewhat fortuitous fashion. Algeria goalkeeper Faouzi Chaouchi attempted to clear a long ball but only succeeded in smashing the ball straight into the advancing Essau Kanyenda. The ball broke to Russel, who hammered home. Rafik Saifi had a great chance to level after 24 minutes when he was played through by Karim Ziani's ball over the top but he sent a lobbed effort over the bar. And 10 minutes before the break it was 2-0 as Kafoteka rose highest to head home Hellings Mwakasungula's cross following a short corner. Algeria's day got even worse four minutes after the break. Chaouchi flapped at a cross and the ball fell to Russel. His shot hit the post and an attempted clearance from Bougherra broke to Banda, who finally smashed the ball home. Meanwhile, in the day's other match, tournament favourites Ivory Coast were held to a 0-0 draw by a stubborn Burkina Faso in their opening Group B match at the Estadio do Cabinda. Vahid Halilhodzic's team dominated possession but could not find the cutting edge to break down a determined Burkinabe defence despite a frontline of Didier Drogba, Bakari Kone and Gervinho. Chelsea striker Drogba had an early shout for a penalty after a sliding challenge from Paul Koulibaly, but the appeals were rejected. Arsenal's Emmanuel Eboue looked to be caught in the area by Mamadou Tall after 20 minutes but again the referee was unmoved. Eboue then burst through down the right only to fire across goal and Siaka Tiene blasted over from a tight angle following Drogba's cross from the right. Chelsea's Salomon Kalou and Portsmouth's Aruna Dindane were introduced off the bench by Ivory Coast in the second half. Drogba was cynically brought down by Mohamed Koffi on the edge of the box 17 minutes from time but the free-kick came to nothing. The Chelsea frontman did test Diakite in the 85th minute but the Burkinabe goalkeeper was equal to his snap-shot from a tight angle as the Ivorians' frustration continued.","Malawi stunned Algeria 3-0 at a near-deserted November 11 stadium in Africa Nations Cup Group A match .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- How does a man from an unassuming Dutch village go to being loved in South Korea, adored in Australia, revered in Russia and admired in England? Guus Hiddink, the Russia and Chelsea coach, has had much to smile about in his 22-year managerial career. By being an exceptional football manager, for one. Enjoying success around the world -- at different levels with different players in different cultures -- has made Guus Hiddink one of the most admired bosses around. Born in rural Varsseveld, near the German border, in 1946, Hiddink's early years were unremarkable. While playing semi-professional football, he spent 10 years as a gym teacher at a school for children with learning difficulties. Most of his playing days were in the midfield of De Graafschap, a smallish club with no history of winning silverware. He later spent two years playing in America before returning to retire at De Graafschap. Watch CNN's exclusive interview with Hiddink » . Little, then, to suggest that here was a man who would achieve so much in his later career. But great players seldom become great managers. His first steps in that direction came at De Graafschap, Holland, where he was assistant manager before moving to the same role at Dutch giants PSV Eindhoven.  See key moments from Hiddink's career » . By 1987, at the age of 40, he was in charge of PSV and led them to their 1988 European Cup win, a feat unthinkable today. He almost reached the final again in 2005 during his second spell in Eindhoven. Hiddink's keeper at PSV, Hans van Breukelen, revealed some of the manager's methods. ""He's very interested in people and immediately tries to create a family environment,"" he told Britain's Sun newspaper. ""I can vividly remember him smoking and having a cup of coffee with his players. I don't know if he still smokes, but he was a chain smoker at PSV."" Hiddink's resume includes stints in other high-pressure jobs such as Fenerbahce, Valencia and Real Madrid, but it's on the international scene where his shrewd tactical mind, organizational skills and motivational prowess grabbed attention. Semifinalists with Holland at the 1998 World Cup, he took over South Korea in 2001 and led the co-hosts of the 2002 World Cup to the last four. No Asian country had ever gone as far in a World Cup before and he left the job a national hero. He agreed to coach another underdog in the shape of Australia in 2005 and led them to the 2006 World Cup. There, the Socceroos had eventual winners Italy rattled for much of their second-round match before succumbing to a late, controversial penalty. Hiddink took Russia to Euro 2008, where they were beaten by Spain at the semifinal stage. Naturally his hometown Varsseveld wanted to capitalize on Hiddink's huge global popularity. The ""Guuseum"" was built in his honor, which for a time was particularly popular with South Koreans on a pilgrimage to see from where their idol hailed. Chelsea were in the doldrums when he arrived on a short-term deal in January as a favor to his comrade, Roman Abramovich, the club's billionaire owner. And the Hiddink magic has worked again, giving the Blues direction to a season that was drifting under previous boss Luiz Felipe Scolari. But the straight-speaking Dutchman is loyal to the project he has in charge of the Russian national side and insists he will leave Chelsea at the end of the season regardless. Sure of himself but free of ego, Hiddink knows what he wants. And, as he's repeatedly proved, he knows how to get it too.","Born in 1946, Hiddink has become one of the best managers in the world .

"(CNN) -- Italian champions Inter Milan have handed a new three-year contract to veteran defender Marco Materazzi. Marco Materazzi now seems set to end his playing career with Inter Milan. The 35-year-old World Cup winner's existing deal had been due to run out at the end of next summer, but he is now set to stay at the San Siro until 2012. A statement on the Inter Web site read: ''FC Internazionale and Marco Materazzi announce the agreement for an extension which will bind the player to the club until 30 June 2012.'' The center-back has made almost 250 appearances for the Nerazzurri since joining Inter in 2001, winning four Serie A titles. However, last season he was restricted to just 15 outings under new manager Jose Mourinho. ""I'll be Inter for life,"" he wrote on his official Web site, Goal.com reported on Thursday. ""And it's not just a figure of speech. I could not have been more satisfied before leaving for my holidays -- I have extended my contract with Inter until 2012, hence until the end of my career. ""That's what I have always desired, since I am an Inter fan as much as I am one of their players. ""I will quit football wearing this shirt, and now I only want to try and win as much as we can both in Italy and in Europe. We'll see each other on July 10 for the start of the new season. I will be fired up."" Materazzi is still best known for his antics in the 2006 World Cup final, when his comments to Zinedine Zidane led to the France playmaker being sent off for a vicious headbutt in his farewell international which ended with the Italians being crowned world champions. Meanwhile, Inter have also completed the signing of Genoa midfielder Thiago Motta on a four-year contract. The 26-year-old, who resurrected his career last season after moving from Barcelona, has finalized a deal that was agreed earlier in the summer and also saw Argentine striker Diego Milito move to the San Siro on Tuesday. Inter confirmed that midfielder Francesco Bolzoni, defender Leonardo Bonucci and striker Riccardo Meggiorini will join the Grifoni on a permanent basis in an overall package including the five players worth a reported $42 million.","Marco Materazzi handed new three-year contract by Italian champions .

"CNN -- Fleet-footed winger Cristiano Ronaldo is Manchester United's most deadly weapon and officially the best footballer in the world. Manchester United's Cristiano Ronaldo is the current FIFA World Player of the Year . Born in 1985 on the Portuguese island of Madeira, the 23-year-old cut his teeth with Portuguese side Sporting Lisbon, where his amazing skill and dribbling ability alerted a host of top European clubs. However, it was Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson who nipped in before his rivals to sign Ronaldo for a reported fee of $19 million in 2003. With Manchester United he has won three Premier League titles, two Football League Cups, the FA Cup, the World Club Championship, and the Champions League. After a phenomenal 2007/2008 season, in which he scored 42 goals for Manchester United in all competitions, he was voted FIFA and FIFPro World Player of the Year and European Player of the Year. That season his 31 Premier League goals won him the Golden Shoe award, making him officially Europe's most prolific goal scorer, and he was also the leading scorer in the Champions League, with eight goals. He capped a remarkable campaign by scoring the opening goal, before also netting from the penalty spot, as United beat Chelsea in a dramatic Champions League final in Moscow. Tall, elegant and powerful, Ronaldo is as good in the air as he is with the ball at his feet, as he proved with his header against Chelsea in last year's final. He also possesses a remarkable and unique free-kick technique, managing to bend and swerve the ball to devastating effect, notably with the goal that effectively ended Arsenal's challenge in the semifinals of this year's Champions League. Apart from his success at Old Trafford, Ronaldo is a regular figure for his national side, making his full international debut in 2003 and going on to represent Portugal at the 2006 World Cup and Euro 2008 finals. However, despite his god-given talent, Ronaldo still gets criticized in Portugal for allegedly failing to replicate his United form in a Portugal shirt. According to Forbes, Ronaldo was football's fifth biggest earner in 2008. Of his $21 million income, $12m was in salary and incentives from Manchester United and another $9 million came from endorsements with global brands like of Nike and Coca-Cola.","Ronaldo Voted FIFA World Player of the Year and European Player of Year .

"(CNN) -- Togo's national football team are on their way home, two days after a deadly attack on their team bus at the Africa Cup of Nations in Angola. Television pictures of the squad and officials leaving their hotel in Cabinda were aired on Eurosport and showed a number of leading players, including captain Emmanuel Adebayor arriving at the airport for the flight home. Earlier, Togolese Prime Minister Gilbert Houngbo told the west African country's news agency that the team ""must return"" after the ambush by gunmen left an assistant coach and the squad's communication officer dead. At least seven others were injured in the attack which occurred Friday in the  enclave of Cabinda near the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo. They included goalkeeper Kodjovi Obilale who is in intensive care, a government spokesman told the news agency. ""We understand the wishes of the players... but it would be irresponsible of the authorities in Togo let them continue,"" said Houngo, who has declared a three-day period of mourning following the attack. Togo's players, who had initally indicated a desire to withdraw from the tournament, decided Saturday night that they wanted to participate after all, striker Thomas Dossevi told CNN. The team were due to play their first game against Ghana in Cabinda on Monday. Dossevi said the players were disappointed with the government's decision to pull the team from the tournament, but they understood it, because Angola's government had yet to provide the team with extra security. The team wanted to play Monday's game, he said, but wanted a change of venue. If organizers were able to change the location of the game, then the team would push to play, he said. However, if there is no change of venue, the team, despite wanting to play, will respect the government's decision and leave the country, Dossevi added. Quoted by the national news agency, Dossevi said the players wanted to play to honor the dead. ""We want to show our colors, our values and that we are men,"" he said. Speaking on Saturday, goalkeeper Kossi Agassa said it felt as if the players had ""gone to war... It's deplorable for Africa. I don't know what other countries will decide, but it's hard. Too hard for us footballers."" In a meeting Saturday, Angolan Prime Minister Antonio Paulo Cassoma assured African football officials that security would be beefed up for the tournament. Confederation of African Football President Issa Hayatou traveled to Cabinda on Saturday to meet Togo's squad as well as those from Ghana, Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso who are also based in the region, according to the CAF Web site. ""You came here to play football but unfortunately two of your brothers were killed,"" Hayatou told the players. ""It is left to you to decide to stay in a competition synonym of fraternity, brotherhood, friendship and solidarity. ""And in case you decide to leave the competition, we will definitely understand your decision and it will be accepted. It is a difficult choice, individual choice and also collective choice, you are the only one can decide."" An armed wing of a separatist group -- the Forces for Liberation of the State of Cabinda (FLEC) -- claimed responsibility for the attack and has threatened to strike again. CNN could not verify the claim independently. Angola, which was wracked by civil war for nearly three decades, brokered a peace deal in 2006 with separatists seeking an independent republic of Cabinda. Dossevi, who plays for French club Nantes, said armed rebels with AK-47s opened fire on the team bus. ""We had just passed the border and a couple of minutes later we were attacked from both sides,"" he said. ""We hid below the seats -- we had police protection in front and behind but we were attacked from both sides. As soon as I heard the bullets I went to the floor. ... The attack lasted for 10-15 minutes,"" Dossevi said. Angolan officials -- trying to assuage security fears that could dampen the war-torn nation's sporting aspirations -- vowed to heighten security, particularly in Cabinda. ""We vehemently condemn the ignoble action, lament the loss of lives, and we reiterate our commitment to guarantee security,"" a government statement said, pledging that the Africa Cup of Nations would be ""a great sporting event and a manifestation of friendship and solidarity among the African people."" Hosts Angola played to a dramatic 4-4 with Mali as the competition began in the capital Luanda later on Sunday. The tournament -- one of the world's biggest -- is Angola's first major sporting event since a 2002 peace deal brought the southern African country's decades-old civil war to an end. It also marks the beginning of a year in the spotlight for African football, with South Africa set to become the continent's first country to host the FIFA World Cup in June. FIFA President Sepp Blatter said Saturday he had faith that Africa would meet the challenge of organizing one of the world's most watched sporting events. ""My thoughts, and those of everyone at FIFA, go out to the victims of this terrible tragedy, and to their families and loved ones,"" Blatter wrote in a letter to Hayatou. ""This awful event cannot dispel the fact that Africa has written some of the greatest chapters in the history of world football... I have faith in Africa, and it is with this faith that together we will organize world football's showcase event in 2010.""","NEW: Togo national football team on their way home from Africa Cup of Nations .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- For years, retired Air Force Col. John Leech has had no desire to return to the Pentagon. Retired Col. John Leech narrowly escaped death at the Pentagon on September 11, 2001. Leech narrowly escaped death September 11, 2001, when a hijacked American Airlines jetliner hit the building. He will attend Thursday's dedication of the Pentagon memorial honoring the 184 people killed in the terror attack. In an earlier visit to the memorial, Leech left a note for his friend Navy Capt. Jack Punches: ""Thanks Jack for serving and dying for our nation."" Leech could barely contain his sadness recently as he watched a Department of Defense videotape showing the burned interior of the area in the building where he was that fateful morning. ""Wow. My God. ... It makes you weak in the knees to see these pictures,"" Leech said. Leech, 54, recently took CNN into an office not far from the conference room where he was that morning. He has avoided touring the building since the attack but finally decided he was ready to ""re-engage"" with the past. In 2001, Leech was working as a Defense Department liaison officer to the White House Drug Policy office. He worked primarily out of the White House but attended meetings at the Pentagon every Tuesday and Thursday morning.  Watch as he returns to the crash site » . As he walked the now-renovated halls where he spent the morning of September 11, he recalled the horror of the day. The shock, he said, was indescribable. ""It hit with such force. I had never experienced anything like it in my life. It rattled you right down to the bone,"" Leech said. Flight 77 slammed into the west wall of the Pentagon at 9:37 a.m. ET. Among the 184 people killed in the building and on the plane were a 3-year-old girl and a 71-year-old retired Navy captain, the youngest and oldest victims, who were both passengers on Flight 77.  A closer look at the new Pentagon memorial » . Several people were killed or severely burned not far from where Leech took cover. He remembers people screaming, ""bloodcurdling screams."" ""I was so lucky. ... It was almost like we were in a protective cocoon,"" Leech recalled. ""I mean, I inhaled a lot of jet fuel vapors, and I got dusted up, but that was the extent of my injuries."" The married father of a 26-year-old woman remembers snaking his way outside the burning building, where in a stupor he noticed a comb that appeared to belong to a small child. ""A little girl's comb that was untouched. It was not scorched; it didn't have smut on it,"" Leech remembered. ""It was a pristine red comb sitting off the side, and next to it was a tattered suitcase, and I can remember looking at that and thinking, who did that belong to? What little girl did that belong to?"" Leech served 28 years in the military and now works for the Department of Homeland Security but hopes to return one day to the Defense Department. Seven years after that horrible day, Leech visited the chapel at the new Pentagon Memorial, a two-acre park, which opens to the public Thursday. It was built at the spot where Flight 77 plowed into the Pentagon and will be open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Thumbing through a condolence book in the chapel, he found the friend whom he was with that day, Navy Capt. Jack Punches. He wrote, ""Thanks Jack for serving and dying for our nation -- John Leech."" ""I've avoided ... anything to do with 9/11, so it feels good to be here,"" he said. ""I mean, a lot happened that day. A lot of good people died. A lot of very good people.""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The apocalyptic tales of nature's impending demise are as well worn as they are numerous. Dr. Joseph Adelegan has pioneered new energy sources, including using cow waste to create cooking gas. But while our leaders wrangle over quotas for  greenhouse emissions over banquets at lavish summits, there are remarkable individuals who are doing their small bit to prevent our planet from peril. Take Nigerian civil engineer, Dr Joseph Adelegan for instance. He firmly believes that the world's future fuel demands can be met through renewable energy. And he is using increasingly innovative methods to achieve these results. Three years ago Adelegan won plaudits for his ""Cows to Kilowatts"" project, which used effluents and waste products from abattoirs to produce cooking gas. The project was a winner of the prestigious 2005 Supporting Entrepreneurs for Environment and Development (SEED) International Awards. It is still going strong and being used to provide cooking fuel for nearly 6000 homes in Ibadan, southern Nigeria. Adelegan tells CNN there are now plans to roll it out across most of Africa, including Zimbabwe, Kenya and Egypt. This time he's back with another groundbreaking idea to use waste from the cassava plant, a staple food of Nigeria, to generate electricity. His project ""Power to the Poor: Off-Grid Lighting from Cassava Waste in Nigeria,"" was awarded a $250,000 grant in May from the World Bank after being named one of the best projects in Africa. According to Adelegan, Nigeria produces over 20 percent of the world's output of cassava, it is a $5 billion industry and provides the third largest source of carbohydrates for human food. However, waste from cassava refining is a major public health problem in Nigeria, causing water pollution and emitting noxious greenhouse gases. Through innovative biogas technology, zero emission bioreactors at specially constructed plants treat the cassava waste and produce biogas which drives microturbines for low cost, safe and reliable off-grid efficient lighting to thousands of rural homes. Using this method, Adelegan says he hopes to generate 200kw daily, which will provide basic electricity for more than 2000 households initially. He told CNN: ""There will be four lighting points in their homes. We're thinking in terms of basic lighting, they will be able to use their TV, cassette player, that sort of thing, but it will not be able to power a refrigerator. ""These people currently rely on kerosene lamps that are very bad for emissions and pollution. We also plan to provide them with low wattage lamps that use just 5kw to bring down usage."" Through his not-for-profit organization-- Global Network for Environment and Economic Development Research)-- Adelegan has achieved the impressive feat of galvanizing the notoriously bureaucratic Nigerian government into action. He told CNN that the governor of Kwara State, in northern Nigeria has donated a plot of land for the launch of the project, scheduled to start next month. The scheme will cost $310,000 and will become profitable in little over three years, Adelegan says. ""This can never replace fossil fuels because of the huge demand we have for them, but we can help to reduce greenhouse emissions by creating alternative sources of energy,"" he said. The Ice Man Cometh . In the furthest reaches of northern India, glaciers once stretched far down the mountains, now they are all but gone as global warming takes its devastating toll. Hardworking but impoverished farmers in the Ladakh region have watched as their sole source of fresh water slowly melts away. But one man is taking matters into his own hands. Enter Chewang Norphel, a softly-spoken but sprightly 72-year-old has created artificial glaciers and managed to generate water and greenery in this barren landscape. Perched high up in the remote cold deserts of the Himalayas, Norphel has mastered the art of harvesting water by using just a few hundred meters of iron pipes and stone embankments. ""Fifty to sixty years ago, we used to have huge glaciers here, the retired civil engineer, told CNN. ""They have been reduced now because of global warming and now they are on high peaks."" The idea of the 'artificial glacier' was born after he noticed that taps were left running in winter to stop the water from freezing in the pipes. The water then flowed into the drains surrounding the taps and froze. ""And it then occurred to me: 'why not try and make artificial glaciers in the winter?' So that local farmers get a real headstart when they need it most,"" Norphel says. The result was a device which traps the waters which melt down the high mountains by turning them into chunks of ice. The largest artificial glacier Norphel has built so far is near the village of Phuktsey. About 1,000 feet (300 meters) long, 150 feet (45 meters) wide, and four feet (1 meter) deep, it supplies irrigation water to the entire village of around 700 people. For Norphel, there are several advantages of an artificial glacier over a natural one. Firstly, it is closer to the village and at a comparatively lower altitude. Natural glaciers, on the other hand, are located way up in the mountains and they melt slowly in summer, releasing water to the villages quite late. Now engineers from other mountainous regions in India and Afghanistan have visited to learn his methods. One artificial glacier costs just $7,000, compared to $34,000 for a dam. Only local materials are needed, and the villagers themselves can build and maintain them. For his efforts, Norphel has been awarded the Far Eastern Economic Review's 1999 Gold Asian Innovation Award, twelve years after he created the first one. However, he is frustrated at the lack of investment and funding to help modernize the design. ""The funding is not sufficient,"" he said. ""We are getting very little amounts and we need a lot more. I hope to get more as this year I want to make two or three more glaciers, with a new design to improve the efficiency."" In 1996, one year after he had retired, Norphel joined the Leh Nutrition Project, a non-governmental organization, as project manager for watershed development. ""Watershed development is the only solution for Ladakh's rural economy. Otherwise, you will have rural folk flocking the city in search of jobs. And there are not many to go around,"" he says.

"(CNN) -- Manchester City manager Robert Mancini has confirmed that the English Premier League side are in negotiations with two Brazilian clubs over a loan move for Robinho. The 26-year-old playmaker joined City from Real Madrid for $52 million in September 2008 but has not settled in Manchester and is being linked with Santos and Sao Paulo. Mancini confirmed that Brazil international is in his squad for City's English League Cup match against Manchester United, but that a deal could be done to help the player move back to his homeland. ""It is possible that something could happen,"" Mancini told reporters on the eve of the semifinal second leg clash at Old Trafford. ""This kind of thing does happen. I know in Italy there were instances when clubs paid a lot of money for a fantastic player but afterwards he needed to play at another club. ""Negotiations are happening but for now he is part of my squad. I have five or six strikers to choose from, which makes it difficult for him and me. ""The World Cup in June is a big problem for him. He wants to play for the national team. I understand that but I must decide what is best for the team."" City have also let Slovakian winger Vladimir Weiss join Bolton on loan for the rest of the season while Wanderers boss Owen Coyle has also brought former Houston Dynamo midfielder Stuart Holden to the club. Elsewhere, West Ham are set to sign South Africa international Benni McCarthy after agreeing an undisclosed fee with Blackburn Rovers. Manchester United have completed a deal to sign Fulham defender Chris Smalling, although the player will remain at Craven Cottage until the end of the season and join Alex Ferguson's side for the start of the 2010/11 campaign. Aston Villa have sold midfielder Craig Gardner to city rivals Birmingham for $4.8million while Wigan are put the final details on a deal to bring in Villarreal forward Marco Ruben. Everton unveiled the signing of Philippe Senderos on loan from Arsenal until the end of the season while Celtic have confirmed the signing of striker Morten Rasmussen from Brondby.","Manchester City manager Robert Mancini has confirmed that the club are in talks with two Brazilian clubs over a loan move for Robinho.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The debate about using technology to help referees has been re-ignited following a number of controversial decisions in the Champions League semi-final between Chelsea and Barcelona. The Hawk-Eye system is already widely used in tennis and has transformed the game. Sepp Blatter, president of FIFA, the game's governing body, has consistently opposed the use of in-game video replays, but goal-line technology, to determine if the ball has crossed the goal line, has received more support. The Hawk-Eye system is extensively used in tennis, using cameras to calculate the trajectory of the ball. The system then uses the trajectory data to determine exactly where the ball has hit the ground, making it invaluable for marginal line calls. Using similar technology, Hawk-Eye Innovations, based in England, has developed a football system to determine if a goal has been scored. It again uses cameras to track the ball and computers to calculate its position. If the system detects that the ball has crossed the goal line a central computer transmits a signal to the referee via either a watch or earpiece. The system was tested at Premier League football club Fulham in 2006 and then at Reading's training ground in 2007. It was backed by the British Football Association and funded by the Premier League. Another goal-line technology, a microchipped football, was developed by Adidas and German firm Cairos Technologies. A microchip built into the football detects a magnetic field generated by underground cables in the penalty area. Like the Hawk-Eye system it uses a computer to send a signal to the referee's watch when a goal is scored. The system was tested at the World Under-17 Championships in 2005 and the 2007 World Club Championship in Tokyo. The International Football Association Board (IFAB), which decides the laws of the game, discusses new rules at an annual general meeting consisting of four representatives from FIFA and one each from England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Explaining the IFAB's decision, Blatter said the microchipped ball had failed in one of the seven World Club Championship matches because of interference to the signal sent to the referee and that it would be difficult to implement the chip technology in the many types of football used around the world. He added that it was not possible to ensure that the Hawk-Eye system worked in a crowded goalmouth, where players might block the cameras' view of the ball. ""FIFA are of the opinion that the systems are very costly, would not add anything to the game and would harm the position of the referee,"" the UK's Press Association reported at the time. Do you think goal-line technology should be used? Share your thoughts in the Sound Off box below. But Hawk-Eye managing director Paul Hawkins told CNN that he believes FIFA has decided that it doesn't want technology in football. ""I saw FIFA last week and told them that we can provide a system if they want it, but it's very clear they don't want the system,"" he said. Hawkins said his company cannot develop the technology any further without more testing in real stadiums, but that kind of testing requires FIFA's consent. The idea that football's governing bodies are opposed to more technology in football has been supported by statements from the sport's governing bodies. In March 2009, Blatter said in a statement: ""The IFAB believes that football is a game for human beings and, as such, we should improve the standard of refereeing - and not turn to technology."" Michel Platini, President of UEFA, European Football's governing body, has expressed similar views. Instead of pursuing goal-line technology, the IFAB chose to trial the idea of having two extra match officials, one behind each goal. A FIFA spokesman told CNN that while the use of goal-line technology hasn't been ruled out forever, even after recent refereeing controversies, the IFAB's current position is to continue to experiment with extra officials. The IFAB's decision means there will be no goal-line technology used in the Champions League final on 27 May, which means there is the potential for more refereeing disputes. ""Maybe there will be a controversial goal in the Champions League final and maybe the discussion over the technology will begin again,"" Oliver Braun, marketing and communications director at Cairos Technologies told CNN. Hawkins agrees that it will take a controversial goal-line incident in a big FIFA match to get the IFAB to change their position, saying it took a series of contentious calls at the 2004 US Open for tennis authorities to seriously consider using the Hawk-Eye system. If that is the case, there will be some football fans hoping for plenty of goal-line drama come May 27.","Debate over whether technology should be used to help referees .

"(CNN) -- CNN Hero Amy Stokes uses the internet to connect South African teens affected by HIV/AIDS and poverty with volunteer mentors from around the world. Stokes is the founder of Infinite Family and spoke with CNN about the importance of her group's efforts in South Africa -- where nearly two million children have been orphaned by AIDS. Below are excerpts from that interview. CNN: How does HIV/AIDS affect a South African child? Amy Stokes: They will talk about being very happy as children and growing up with two parents until they were grade school level. And then they'll lose one of their parents. They will move where they can be in a community that helps support them and then they'll lose the other parent. Then they're moved into a home where it's an auntie running the house -- and they'll lose that aunt. And then they go to live with the gogo -- or a grandmother -- and before long, they're living with 10 other children in the same 20 square foot space. That gogo is spending all of her time just trying to feed everybody, much less being able to help them prepare for their future. CNN: How widespread is the problem? Stokes: Many of these communities have lost up to 40 percent of the young adults [from HIV/AIDS]. So the children ... don't learn the survival skills that they would have learned tagging along with an adult -- watching an adult as they work, or do grocery shopping, or cooking or any of the life skills that they need. These children are losing, not only love and nurturing, but ... the education of having a parent attend to them. CNN: What's the biggest challenge these kids face? Stokes: They lack access to everything that would teach them what is needed to be successful. There's no technology; there are no computers. The kids walk into our computer labs having never touched a mouse or a keyboard before. However, they are the most hopeful children you will ever meet. They are resilient, resourceful; they are joyful; they are very ambitious. CNN: What change do you see in them as they interact with their mentors? If you reach out to them they will grab that lifeline and work so hard to make your investment of time and talent worth your while. They know that they are in a situation they would like to change -- their lot in life, their future -- but they struggle very hard until someone helps show them the way. What Infinite Family does is we expand their village to include the entire world. When they get connected with their mentors, the mentors make sure that no one is ever truly alone.

"MUSOMA, Tanzania (CNN) -- Lizzie Cameron is in Musoma, Tanzania working with the Musoma Engineering Project. Claire's 10th birthday: ""I taught them how to play pin the tail on the donkey, although we replaced a donkey with a zebra, and I baked Claire a birthday banana cake."" The Musoma Engineering Project is the only charity of its kind in the region and aims to provide teaching and support for local disabled children and teenagers. With the project Lizzie will be helping the teachers teach skills like woodworking, leatherwork and dressmaking. Follow her experiences in her blogs and video diaries. November 14, 2007 When I signed up to work at the Musoma Engineering Project I was given the option of living in my own house or with a local family. I was really unsure of which to choose but decided to live with Dennis and his family. I made this decision because I thought it would be good to experience how a Tanzanian family live and I also hoped that Dennis would take me under his wing, so to speak, and look out for me if I got into any trouble or encountered any problems. After being here for two months I have no doubt that I made the right decision. I really have been made to feel like part of the family and welcomed into their home as if it were my own. What I've found really interesting is seeing the daily routines and how they differ to back home. Simple activities like cooking, cleaning, shopping, etc. are all performed quite differently to the Western world. I had anticipated that the food would be different, but if anything I've been pleasantly surprised by what is on offer here. One thing I like is that you really know where your food has come from. If you want to eat chicken, you point to the one you want then kill it and pluck it yourself. If you want fish, a local fisherman will drop off his daily catch at your house. Nothing is processed, artificial or vacuum packet. If I was living on my own I would have been surviving on fruit and veg for a year, as I had no idea how to gut a fish or skin a chicken. The girls have also taught me how to make chapattis and other traditional Tanzanian dishes. I hadn't thought about how I would wash my clothes for example. I didn't think they would have washing machines, but I hadn't really thought it through. So every Sunday I fill my basin up with water, some soap and get scrubbing. The family laugh at my attempts, it must be obvious I'm not used to such hard work. This Sunday was Claire's 10th birthday party so I got to join in the celebrations. She had about 20 of her friends around at the house, all of whom were dressed immaculately in beautiful dresses and suits. There weren't any expensive presents or entertainment like you'd get back home but the kids seemed to have just as good a time. I taught them how to play pin the tail on the donkey, although we replaced a donkey with a zebra, and I baked Claire a birthday banana cake. People open their homes to visitors anytime of the day too. Often when I return home the living room will be full of the neighbors. Anyone is welcome to stay, even if a bed is not available, they just share one. I really am glad I decided to live with a family here.

"(CNN) -- Chelsea remain top of the English Premier League, despite suffering a shock 2-1 defeat at Everton on a Wednesday night filled with high drama. Louis Saha scored twice for Everton, and the French striker also missed a penalty, as David Moyes' side claimed some compensation for their defeat by the London side in last summer's FA Cup final. Chelsea took a 16th-minute lead when Florent Malouda ran onto Didier Drogba's flick to fire past goalkeeper Tim Howard. But Everton levelled 17 minutes later when Saha gave marker John Terry the slip before heading home Landon Donovan's corner. Saha then had a great chance to give Everton the lead on the stroke of half-time after Donovan was fouled by Ricardo Carvalho in the area. However, his spot-kick lacked power and direction and was comfortably saved by goalkeeper Petr Cech. But Saha was eventually to win the game fror Everton with Terry again at fault. The former England captain failed to deal with a long cross-field ball, allowing Saha to control the pass in an instant before striking home a 75th minute winner. Manchester United would have gone top of the table with a win at Aston Villa, but the defending champions drew 1-1 after playing most of the match with 10 men following the dismissal of Portuguese winger Nani. In a dress rehearsal for the League Cup final later this month, Carlos Cuellar headed home Stewart Downing's cross to give Villa a 19th-minute lead. But United levelled soon after when Ryan Giggs' pull-back was put through his own net by defender James Collins. Nani was then sent off for a 28th-minute two-footed lunge on Stilyan Petrov, incurring a three-match ban which will see him miss the Wembley showpiece. United held on for a battling draw with a superb second-half rearguard performance, and the result means they like just a point behind Chelsea with 12 matches still remaining. Arsenal remain third in the table, but are now just six points behind Chelsea and five behind United, are a hard-fought 1-0 home win over fourth-paced Liverpool. Abou Diaby headed home Tomas Rosicky's cross with 18 minutes remaining, to end a barren run for the Gunners after successive defeats against both Chelsea and Manchester United. Tottenham's Champions League hopes took a a severe knock after they were beaten 1-0 at struggling Wolves -- who have now beaten the London side both home and away. David Jones side-footed home a Matt Jarvis cross to give Wolves a vital three points that moves them out of the relegation zone. Meanwhile, Hull lie just one place above the drop zone after they were beaten 1-0 at Blackburn. The home side scored the only goal in the 16th minute when goalkeeper Boaz Myhill diverted Martin Olsson's cross into his own net. The visitors ended the match with 10 men after George Boateng was sent off for an elbow on Morten Gamst Pedersen. West Ham also moved out of the drop zone with a superb 2-0 home win over in-form Birmingham. A superb Alessandro Diamanti free-kick and a second from Carlton Cole proved enough for the Hammers, giving new owners David Sullivan and David Gold victory against the club they used to own.","Chelsea remain top of the English Premier League, despite suffering a 2-1 defeat at Everton .

"(CNN) -- Joshua Macabuag is a 23 year-old recent graduate of the University of Oxford's Pembroke College. Josh, as he prefers to be called, studied civil engineering and achieved some of the highest marks in his class. ""Josh is a very brilliant chap,"" remarked one of his professors. Josh got interested in relief and development work during his second year at school and has already spent one summer abroad in Japan, where he worked with Japan Railways. He loves to travel and perhaps it's his wanderlust that's motivated him to take the next year off and travel to Jozini, South Africa. But it won't be an easy year. Jozini is a small town in northeastern KwaZulu-Natal Province on the main route to Mozambique. It is one of the most impoverished areas of South Africa, but is also surrounded by a massive dam, game preserves and two majestic mountain ranges. Josh, who speaks some Spanish and has taught himself Japanese, will now focus on learning some Zulu. He's teamed up with the charity Engineers Without Borders, and plans to put his education to use and get some practical experience in the field. Josh will be working on a new sports complex in Jozini, a facility that will double as an educational facility for local youths. The idea is to replace a dilapidated, existing facility with a new one that will be self-sustaining and provide the community with a way of generating income as well as prepare area kids for a career. There probably won't be much free time for squash and the martial arts that Josh normally enjoys, but it's certain new talents will emerge over the next year during Josh's time abroad.

"New York (CNN) -- Brooke Astor's son got one to three years in prison Monday for scheming to bilk millions of dollars from the late philanthropist's estate. Anthony Marshall, 85, had been found guilty of 14 of the 15 counts against him. Marshall was convicted in October of the most serious charges -- first-degree grand larceny and scheming to defraud. He faced a minimum of one to three years, or as much as eight to 25 years in state prison. Marshall's wife, Charlene, sobbed after hearing the sentence as supporters hugged her. One of the most serious convictions involved Marshall giving himself a $1 million-a-year raise for handling his mother's affairs, said Assistant District Attorney Joel Seidemann. Marshall's former attorney, Francis Morrissey, was also convicted of five counts relating to the case, including forgery and scheming to defraud Astor. Seidemann on Monday recommended a sentence of 1.5 to 4.5 years in prison. He objected to bail pending appeal but told the judge he had no problem with Marshall staying out of prison until the first of the year. He asked for restitution of $12.3 million. Defense attorneys argued Monday for the lowest sentence of one to three years in state prison and asked that the judge not impose restitution. The defense team raised concerns about Marshall's health and indicated that it will appeal the verdict. In a brief statement to the court before the sentence was announced, Marshall only said, ""I have nothing to add to what my attorneys have said."" The judge ruled that Marshall must surrender on January 19. Assuming he goes to prison, Marshall can apply for parole after eight months. Or he may apply for immediate parole for medical reasons under a new provision called medical parole. The judge also gave Marshall's co-defendant, attorney Francis Morrissey, the same sentence of one to three years in prison. Morrissey was convicted of four felonies and a misdemeanor, including forgery and scheming to defraud Astor. Like Marshall, Morrissey's sentence will not begin until January 19. Astor's grandson, Philip Marshall, declined to comment after the sentencing. He was concerned about his grandmother's care in her final years, which the younger Marshall's attorney deemed ""elder abuse,"" that eventually led to his father's indictment. Marshall was convicted October 8 of 13 felonies and one misdemeanor. The felony of grand larceny in the first degree carried a sentence of one to three years. The other counts will run concurrently. During the trial, Marshall was portrayed as a cold, calculating man who spent the last years of his socialite and megaphilanthropist mother's life stealing her fortune to line his pockets . ""These defendants, two morally depraved individuals, preyed on a physically and mentally ill 101-year-old woman to steal millions of dollars -- dollars that she had intended to go to help the lives of ordinary New Yorkers,"" Seidemann said, echoing his closing argument to the jury. The sentence came after a six-month trial that featured as witnesses a ""Who's Who"" of New York's social elite, including Henry Kissinger, Graydon Carter, Barbara Walters, Vartan Gregorian and Annette de la Renta. The trial was a tabloid feeding frenzy, fostering headlines such as ""Bad heir day,"" ""Mrs. Astor's disaster"" and ""DA's kick in the Astor."" During trial testimony, Marshall's attorneys called no character witnesses to come to his defense. But before sentencing for the crimes, friends and celebrities who knew Marshall well wrote letters to the court trying to show what they believe was his true character. Marshall was a loyal, churchgoing man, a Purple Heart recipient wounded in Iwo Jima during World War II and a son who tried mightily but could never live up to the high ideals of his socialite mother, according to letters friends submitted to the court. Whoopi Goldberg told a judge in her letter that she met Marshall and his wife 10 years ago when Goldberg moved into a building on the Upper East Side. Her interactions with Marshall, she wrote, gave her an insight into his relationship with his mother, and in turn taught her about how fame can affect family dynamics. ""I also understand what it must be like for my own daughter to be around my fame,"" she wrote. ""I am not comparing myself to Mrs. Astor, but I've seen how you can be dismissed as not being good enough, or hip enough, and seeing it happen to Tony made me make sure that it didn't happen to my own daughter."" NBC's ""Today"" show weatherman, Al Roker, also came to Marshall's defense, having met him at his church 10 years ago. He argued Marshall had suffered enough, paying a price greater than any sentence a judge could hand down -- seeing his son turn on him during the trial and being portrayed in a negative light each day. ""Given his advanced age and deteriorating health, justice may be better served by turning a compassionate eye towards this good son, father and patriot and finding it in your heart not to add 'prisoner' to Anthony Marshall's otherwise unblemished resume,"" Roker wrote in his letter to the court. Goldberg, too, wrote she believed ""breaking this man"" by putting him in prison was not the right punishment. ""Please don't put him in jail,"" she wrote at the end of her letter. ""It would only amount to an unnecessary cruelty that would serve no real purpose. Hasn't Tony been through enough?"" CNN's Jessica Ravitz contributed to this report.","Anthony Marshall sentenced Monday to one to three years in prison .

"(CNN)  -- First, it was babies in bars. Now, children in fine-dining restaurants are feeding a raging debate. The argument is fueled by new efforts of some  Michelin-starred New York restaurants like L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon and Café Boulud to cater to the under-3-year-old crowd. Not every patron of expensive restaurants desires to share a formal dining experience with young children who may be more interested in playing with their food than savoring it . Some are upset at the parents of the young diners, but others believe that even adults don't always behave in ways that allow customers to enjoy peaceful dining. More than 100 people -- mostly against the idea of tots at upper-echelon restaurants -- posted their heated comments in response to Shivani Vora's recent New York Times piece, ""Fine Dining Where Strollers Don't Invite Sneers."" ""People who force their toddlers on others in enclosed public spaces like fine restaurants (and airplanes) are even more selfish than those who insist on talking on cell phones in such places,"" one Times reader said. ""If you object to 'howls' (based on your ridiculous presumption that all children inevitably howl), let's start by excluding all the adults who are yelling into their cell phones, are drunk and/or obnoxious, etc."" another commenter said. ""I'm with the majority -- thanks for this list, because now we know which high-end restaurants we will never set foot in,"" another said. World's 50 best restaurants list . That's certainly the customers' standpoint, but what about those manning the stoves and host stands? Many chefs and restaurateurs with families are teaching their own children to be good restaurant citizens and are making accommodations for kids in their establishments. Marc Murphy, chef and judge on the Food Network's ""Chopped"" series, created children's menus at all three of his New York City restaurants so his two children, ages 3 and 5, have dining options on their nights out. At Landmarc, adult diners can enjoy Murphy's foie gras terrine or roasted marrow bones while their booster-seated offspring have the option of ordering orecchiette (a type of pasta), grilled lamb chops, peanut butter and Nutella sandwiches or petit filet mignon. Michael Anthony, executive chef of Michelin-starred Gramercy Tavern and a father of three (including a newborn), is even more accommodating. Chef Colicchio: Don't fear fine dining . ""When my own children are in the restaurant, I've sent them soufflé crackers with what looks like little frogs' tongues. I've sent out a beet dressed as a mouse,"" Anthony told CNN. Anthony also works with a New York public school, P.S. 41, offering lessons in table manners to first-graders. There are also hands-on cooking activities, a tour and lunch at his restaurant, as well as visits to the Greenmarket, an open-air farmers market -- all experiences geared toward establishing a fundamental understanding of where food comes from. ""They're very impressionable and starting to form their opinions about food. We want to impress upon the kids that food is fun,"" Anthony said of the program. Teachers in the program particularly focus on younger diners developing a ""restaurant voice,"" teaching children that restaurants are a busy place and that certain manners differ from when one is out playing tag in the park. This notion is especially poignant at Gramercy Tavern -- which Anthony will admit is a fine dining establishment -- as there won't be stroller valet any time soon. ""It's not a restaurant adapted to children; it's a group of people who are warm and welcoming,"" Anthony said. The haute tots are, after all, children -- with an average attention span of three to five minutes per calendar year of their age. Anthony says he has invited particularly antsy adolescents back into the kitchen to focus their attention after they have created a disturbance. ""As with any performance, practicing before a big event, such as going out to a restaurant, is a good idea,"" advises Sue Fox in ""Etiquette for Dummies"" in a chapter on Tips for Children and Teens. ""I know of people who dress their kids up, sit them down at the family dining room table and hand out homemade menus to practice eating out.""","Some patrons at fine restaurants are not pleased with sharing space with disruptive children .

"KHARTOUM, Sudan (CNN) -- (CNN) -- Fighting resumed Tuesday in a disputed oil-rich town in Sudan, threatening to reignite a calamitous civil war which ended three years ago. Fresh fighting in Sudan over an oil-rich town has raised fears civil war could again erupt. Fresh fighting in Sudan over an oil-rich town has raised fears civil war could again erupt. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon deplored the fighting between the Sudanese military and troops with the Sudan People's Liberation Army. The SPLA fought a rebellion against the government for more than 20 years until both sides signed a peace deal in 2005. The deal's Comprehensive Peace Agreement ended a north-south civil war that killed about 2 million people and displaced more than 4 million others. An impasse over the boundaries of the town of Abyei is a major reason the peace agreement has not been fully implemented. Fighting erupted in Abyei on May 13. It resumed Tuesday despite a cease-fire and has ""resulted in the destruction"" of the town ""and the displacement of between 30,000 and 50,000 people,"" the secretary general said in a statement. Don't Miss Sudanese opposition leader arrested Sudan cuts ties with Chad after attack Darfur rebels advance on Sudan capital, their leader says ""If the situation is not urgently addressed, the achievements thus far of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement could be placed at serious risk,"" he said. The civil war in Sudan, which started in 1983, pitted a northern government dominated by Arab Muslims against black Christians and animists in southern Sudan. That conflict was not directly related to ongoing violence in the Darfur region of western Sudan. Human rights groups and United Nations say the Sudanese military armed and trained Arab militias in Darfur after a rebellion erupted in 2003. They say the military and militias have engaged in widespread killing, rape and forced displacements in Darfur as they battle about rebels who have splintered into roughly a dozen groups.

"(CNN) -- Padraig Harrington has accepted his punishment after being disqualified from the Abu Dhabi Championship for an incident during Thursday's opening round of the European Tour golf event. Television replays showed that the three-time major winner inadvertently moved his ball with his hand on the green at the seventh hole, but did not sign for the required two-stroke penalty. The Irishman went on to card a seven-under-par 65 which left him one shot off the lead, but he did not tee off for Friday's second round after officials noticed his infringement. ""I was aware I hit the ball picking up my coin. I looked down at the time and was pretty sure it had just oscillated and had not moved, so I continued on,"" the world No. 26 told the European Tour website. ""In slow motion it's pretty clear the ball has moved three dimples forward and it's come back maybe a dimple and a half. At the end of the day that's good enough, but I wouldn't have done anything differently yesterday -- there was nothing I could do about it at that moment in time."" The European Tour's senior referee Andy McFee explained that Harrington was disqualified after signing for an incorrect score. ""It's a minute movement, but it's a movement and he never replaced it, so he should have included a two-stroke penalty. Because he signed for a score lower than actually taken, the penalty is disqualification,"" McFee said. Harrington, who has not won on the European Tour since his second British Open victory and subsequent U.S. PGA Championship triumph in 2008, said he had no quarrels with the officials. ""The one thing all golfers love about their sport is the fact that we can stand up and say, 'We have the best rules, we are the fairest, we call them on ourselves.' ""I think in this situation and other situations like that, with the new technology, maybe going forward, that the penalties can be changed. But the actual rulings have to stay where they are."" Meanwhile, defending champion Martin Kaymer claimed a three-shot lead on Friday after shooting 65 to move up to 12-under 132 at the halfway stage. The 2010 Race To Dubai winner -- also the 2008 victor in Abu Dhabi -- carded a flawless seven-birdie second round, five of them coming in his first seven holes. The German, playing his first tournament of 2011, will replace Tiger Woods as world No. 2 if he finishes in the top seven. First-round leader Charl Schwartzel was second after a 71, as the South African dropped three shots in five holes in the middle of his front nine and made two more bogeys after the turn before finishing with a birdie. In-form Schwartzel holds early Abu Dhabi lead . That left last weekend's Joburg Open winner a shot clear of U.S. Open champion Graeme McDowell, who countered three bogeys with five birdies in his 70. World No. 12 Rory McIlroy was tied for seventh on 138 after a 67, while former European Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie was another shot back in a group of eight after a 69. World No. 4 Phil Mickelson (70) was tied for 25th on 141 along with South Africa's two-time major winner Retief Goosen (71). World No. 8 Paul Casey, the winner here in 2007 and 2009, was tied for 50th after a 70, while top-ranked fellow Englishman Lee Westwood may also scrape into the weekend rounds after a 75 left him tied for 62nd on 144 -- a shot inside the projected cut. Westwood suffered two double-bogeys on his front nine, but bounced back with birdies at two of his last three holes. Last year's runner-up Ian Poulter and British Open Louis Oosthuizen were both set to miss out on 145. Meanwhile, Venezuelan rookie Jhonattan Vegas claimed a share of the lead at the PGA Tour's Bob Hope Classic after shooting five-under 67 in California on Thursday. The 26-year-old carded eight birdies but closed with his third bogey at the PGA West's Nicklaus Course in La Quinta. The first man from his country to play on the main U.S. circuit, he had been second overnight following his 64 at the Palmer Course. American Boo Weekley carded 66 at the Nicklaus Course to join him on 13-under 131, with fellow Americans Charles Howell (66) and Chris Crouch (65) tied for third another shot back. The five-round charity event is played over four courses with a mix of professional and amateur players.","Padraig Harrington disqualified from Abu Dhabi Championship after rule infringement .

"(CNN) -- Czech President Vaclav Klaus signed the European Union's Lisbon Treaty Tuesday, he announced on his Web site, paving the way for major changes to the way the 27-nation bloc is run. The Czech Constitutional court ruled hours earlier that the treaty did not conflict with the country's constitution, a government spokesman said. ""I respect the decision of the Constitutional Court,"" Klaus said in a written statement, though he added he ""disagreed"" with it and said the court's analysis was ""not neutral."" However, he concluded, ""I signed the Lisbon Treaty at 3 p.m. (1400 GMT)."" The Czech Republic was the last EU nation left to approve the treaty, which could effectively give the EU a president and a foreign minister. Klaus's signature means the treaty -- which would replace the EU constitution and aims to streamline the workings of the European Union -- could come into force as early as December 1. The Czech Parliament's two chambers voted in favor of the treaty earlier this year. But in late September, 17 Czech senators asked the country's Constitutional Court to examine whether some further parts of the treaty were compatible with the country's constitution. The court ruled Tuesday that they pose no conflict. Klaus agreed Friday to ratify the document if the court approved, after winning an exemption ensuring it would not allow ethnic Germans forced out of the country after World War II to reclaim their former lands. ""I consider this to be the best possible result and intend to raise no other objections to the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty,"" Klaus said Thursday after gaining the exemption. Voters in two countries had rejected the EU constitution in 2005. The Lisbon Treaty, in addition to streamlining EU decision-making and creating an EU council president and foreign minister, would introduce rotating representatives for member countries in the EU Commission, the union's executive branch, and would change the voting weights of countries on certain issues. Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, said he welcomed the Czech court's decision. ""We are now very close to full ratification."" Reinfeldt said. ""Together with a signature in the Czech Republic, the presidency will continue the completion of Lisbon Treaty preparations."" The Czech Republic isn't the only EU country to demand an exemption before ratifying the treaty. Poland recently won an opt-out over social issues including gay marriage; Britain won assurances that EU law would not prevail over its own legal system. The treaty would also give national parliaments veto power over some proposed changes to EU policy. All member states have to ratify the treaty before it can be adopted. Irish voters approved the treaty last month after previously rejecting it. The European Union had assured Ireland that the treaty would not affect the country's anti-abortion laws or its neutrality and that Ireland would keep a European commissioner.","Czech President Vaclav Klaus signs EU's Lisbon Treaty, paving way for major changes to way 27-nation bloc is run .

"(CNN) -- World-record signing Cristiano Ronaldo scored on his debut as Real Madrid kicked off the Spanish football season with a shaky 3-2 victory at home to Deportivo La Coruna on Saturday night. Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates after paying off a small chunk of his record transfer fee with a goal on his Real debut. Real's new generation of ""Galacticos"" were preceded onto the pitch by the world's fastest man Usain Bolt, with the Jamaican sprint star dribbling a ball to the delight of a packed Bernabeu crowd. Coach Manuel Pellegrini fielded seven new signings against a team who stunned Real 2-1 on the opening day last season to foreshadow a season of massive upheaval for the underachieving capital club. The first goal took just 26 minutes in coming as $92 million signing Kaka fed the ball to $50 million capture Karim Benzema, whose shot rebounded off the post and fell welcomingly to Real captain Raul to score. Ronaldo, who cost $130 million when he left Manchester United, then rose highest to meet a free-kick from $50 million midfielder Xavi Alonso but headed over the bar. Deportivo stunned the home crowd in the 30th minute when former Real striker Riki was allowed a free header to equalize in the type of defensive lapse that typified Madrid's performances last season. But while Pellegrini has obvious problems to sort out at the back, where he fielded debutants Ezequiel Garay and Raul Albiol in the absence of the suspended Pepe, he has volumes of attacking resources at the other end of the pitch. His team took the lead again in the 34th minute through Ronaldo, who coolly slotted home from the penalty spot after Raul went down under goalkeeper Daniel Aranzubia's challenge following a clever pass from midfielder Lassana Diarra. However, Real could not hold onto the lead, with veteran Juan Carlos Valeron firing a leveler from the edge of the area just 43 seconds into the second half following a cross by Andres Guardado. Valeron should have made it 3-2 with an even easier chance 12 minutes later, but he sidefooted another pass from Guardado wide of the Real goal. Real continued to pile forward in numbers, peppering the Deportivo goal, but it was the unexpected figure of Diarra who netted the eventual winner in the 60th minute with a low drive from outside the box. Benzema should have doubled the lead soon after following a mistake by Aranzubia, but saw his chip over the keeper rebound off the bar. The Frenchman made way for last season's top scorer Higuain in the 72nd minute, with the Argentine lucky to avoid being booked for a blatant dive in the penalty area. Real's rivals Barcelona start the defense of their title on Monday at home to Sporting Gijon, having already won a trophy this season by beating Shakhtar Donetsk 1-0 in the European Super Cup on Friday.","World-record signing Cristiano Ronaldo scores on his debut for Real Madrid .

We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- Dennis Chamberland doesn't just want to live underwater: he wants anyone to join him. And he's determined to make that a reality within a decade. Chamberland joined NASA as a bioengineer in the mid '80s, just as the  manned space program was starting to thunder forward. But rather than looking up to the stars, he began looking down - deep down. As a developer of the agency's Advanced Space Life Support Systems, which monitors the safety for all off-planet habitation pursuits, Chamberland soon became a lead proponent of research on an idea being floated by NASA at the time: using the sea as a testbed for space exploration. Before long, this homegrown explorer would become one of the country's leading proponents of undersea habitation, and an  advocate for what he calls the ""space-ocean analog."" An aquanaut and Mission Commander on seven NASA underwater missions,  Chamberland has also pursued landmark research in bioengineering and  become a prolific writer of science books and sci-fi novels. But it was his work for NASA that resulted in his harvesting of the first agricultural crop in a manned habitat on the sea floor, and led to his designing and construction of the Scott Carpenter Space Analog Station, a two man undersea habitat off Key Largo. The little permanent submarine has been visited by a range of curious futurist  explorers, including James Cameron and TV producer Rod Roddenberry, Jr. See the rest of The Aquatic Life of Dennis Chamberland at VBS.TV . Chamberland's next goal, he explains in this episode of Motherboard:  colonizing the sea. To move humans to an underwater ""Aquatica,"" as he calls the habitable regions of the ocean, he launched the Atlantica Expeditions, which are attempting to build the first underwater settlement for permanent human colonization. This isn't a glossy sci-architectural lark or a toe-dip. Starting with the premise that nearly three quarters of our planet's largest biome have long remained invisible - and are increasingly endangered - the Atlantica project seeks ""a human colony whose primary purpose it is to monitor and  protect this most essential of all the earth's biomes. Soon, beneath the sea, families will live and work. Children will go to school. A new generation of children will be born there - the first citizens of  a new ocean civilization whose most important purpose will be to continuously monitor and protect the global ocean environment."" Set to commence by next year, the first expedition will be initiated by the submersion of the Leviathan, a small underwater habitat that can house up to four people. He's not only certain that the colonization of the ocean floor is imminent; he's making it happen.","Dennis Chamberland aspires to make undersea human habitation a reality .

"(CNN) -- Voters this year may be more anxious than angry. Just 35 percent think the country's on the right track, according to exit polls Tuesday night, to 62 percent who think things are heading in the wrong direction. Voters aren't quite as pessimistic as they were just two years ago, when those numbers were 21 and 74 percent -- but they're unhappier than they were back in 2006, when 41 percent felt the nation was on the right track, to 55 percent who said they were headed in the wrong direction. The economy wasn't just the most important issue to voters this year -- with unemployment hovering around 9.6 percent, it was roughly twice as important to them as the other top issues of concern combined. Sixty-two percent of voters named the economy as their most important issue this year. Health care ranked a distant second, at 19 percent, with illegal immigration and Afghanistan trailing at 8 and 7 percent. With the exception of the 3 percent of voters who said the economy's doing just fine, most of those polled -- on either end of the political spectrum -- think the economy's ailing. But who's to blame? Thirty-five percent of voters in early exit polls say Wall Street's the villain. The next name on the list: former President Bush -- 29 percent point their fingers in his direction. President Obama follows, at 24 percent. They may not blame him for the state of the economy, but just 45 of voters in early exit poll results are happy with Obama's performance, while 54 percent disapprove. That's the same territory President Clinton's numbers were in back in 1994 exit polls, when 44 percent of voters approved of the job he was doing, while 52 percent were unhappy. Back in 2006, the same numbers for President Bush were 43 and 57 percent. The rest of the federal government isn't off the hook -- voters in both parties are upset with how activist the government's been: 4 in 5 Republicans say it's doing too much. And 2 in 3 Democrats say it isn't doing enough. Sixty-one percent of Democrats say the new health care law needs to be expanded. And 82 percent of Republicans say it should be repealed. Today's result is all about who showed up...and who didn't. Independents made up about a third of the electorate today -- and they broke big for Republicans. Democrats are barely holding on to their advantage among women -- but men have turned Republican by a wide margin. (In Florida, they broke big for Senate candidate Marco Rubio, giving him half the independent vote in a three-way race.) Two-thirds of Hispanic voters, 6 in 10 young voters and the overwhelming share of black voters backed Democrats. There just aren't as many of them as there were last cycle, as a percentage of the total vote: The percentage of youth voters dropped by half in early exit polls, from 18 to 9. The black vote also edged down by at least a fifth. Midterm voters tend to be older than voters in general. But this year's midterm voters weren't just older than the voters who show up when the White House is up for grabs. They're older than a typical midterm voter. In fact: Seniors haven't made up this big a share of voters since 1994. Twenty-four percent of those who cast ballots this year were over the age of 65 -- and their support for Democrats has plummeted. Back in '94, 48 percent of voters over age 65 backed Democratic candidates. In 2006 and '08, 49 percent supported the party. This year, that number sank to 39 percent. And older voters -- who aren't fans of the health care bill -- have discovered a new-found fondness for the GOP: the Republican Party's share of the senior vote soared from 48 percent last cycle to 58 percent this year. How much credit should the Tea Party take for tonight's GOP gains? Exit polls paint a mixed picture. Forty-five percent of independent voters expressed support for the movement, which is 4 for 6 in Senate races so far tonight, with two still too close to call. The older you are, the polls suggest, the more likely you are to back the Tea Party -- and tonight was a senior moment. Forty-seven percent of those 60 and older back the Tea Party; the number for 18-29-year-olds was more than 20 points lower. On the other hand: A majority of voters (56 percent) said the Tea Party wasn't a factor in their vote tonight. The percentage that said they wanted to send a message in favor of the movement (23 percent) was just a few points higher than those who said they were trying to strike a blow against it (18 percent). Republicans are on track for the biggest House pickup by any major party since 1948 -- a historic win. Voters clearly aren't too happy with the Democratic Party. But exit polls suggest they aren't terribly thrilled with the GOP either. Democrats have a 10-point favorability gap: 43 percent of voters have a positive opinion of the party, while 53 percent aren't thrilled. The Republican Party also gets a thumbs-down from 53 percent of the nation's voters, with just 41 percent saying they're happy with the party. Compare that with 1994 and 2006, when voters had a net positive view of the incoming party. The numbers suggest Tuesday night may signal a rejection of the Democratic Party -- but something less than an embrace of the GOP.","Mood of voters improves from two years ago .

Voters blame Wall Street, Bush and Obama for economy ."
"(CNN) -- The remains of an Oregon teenager missing for more than 25 years were recently identified by authorities, and police are looking into whether she might have been a victim of Gary Ridgway, known as the ""Green River Killer."" Police believe Ridgway could be responsible for the death of Angela Marie Girdner because her body was found within a mile of the remains of two other women that Ridgway admitted killing, the county sheriff's office said. Those bodies were found in Washington County, Oregon, near Portland. The bodies of Ridgway's other 46 victims were found in the Seattle, Washington, area. The most prolific known serial killer in U.S. history, Ridgway is serving 48 consecutive life sentences. He has denied involvement in Girdner's death, as well as that of Tammie Liles, whose remains were found near Girdner's. Girdner was 16 when she was reported missing by her parents in May 1983, authorities said. She was a straight-A student at her Catholic high school ""until she met the wrong people,"" they said. Girdner rode a bus from her home in Portland to Beaverton to school, and her parents believe she met people on the bus line ""who turned her life upside down with drugs and eventually prostitution."" The last time Girdner's parents heard from her was in July 1983, police said: ""She called and told her mother that she was OK, but did not say where she was at that time."" Girdner was killed sometime between that phone call and early 1985. Her skeletal remains were found April 22, 1985, in a wooded area of Tualatin, Oregon. It was one of two bodies found by people walking in the area. The bodies, however, were unidentified for years. ""Both bodies were badly decomposed and there were only traces of clothing discovered with them,"" the sheriff's statement said. The other body was identified in 1998 as being that of Liles, who was last seen in June 1983 working as a prostitute in the Seattle area. She was reported missing by her family in March 1988, and her body was identified using dental records. In June 1985, two months after the remains of Girdner and Liles were found, two other sets of skeletal remains were found within a mile of where theirs were. ""Detectives recognized the similarities with the Seattle area's Green River killings that were predominant in the news at the time,"" the sheriff's statement said. They contacted the Green River Task Force at the King County, Washington, Sheriff's Office, and the bodies were eventually identified as those of Shirley Shirell and Denise Bush. Both women were known Seattle prostitutes, authorities said, and both had been reported missing. Girdner's remains were sent to the Oregon State Medical Examiner's Office, which sent them to the King County Medical Examiner's Office in Seattle for possible identification. King County could not identify the remains, so they were sent back to Oregon. ""Unfortunately, somewhere in the transfer process they were misplaced,"" the Washington County Sheriff's Office said. ""Earlier this year, Angela's remains resurfaced at the Clackamas County [Oregon] Medical Examiner's Office."" After realizing the bones did not belong to a Clackamas County case, authorities sent them back to the state medical examiner, who notified Washington County of the unidentified bones. Sheriff's detectives asked the medical examiner's office to compare the remains once again with dental records of missing people in the area. ""Based on the investigation conducted over the years, Angela's remains were compared to the dental records her dentist had submitted in 1985,"" in October, authorities said. ""They matched."" Ridgway, now 60, was arrested in 2001 in King County for the murders of five women. He later admitted he was the ""Green River Killer"" and pleaded guilty to murdering 48 women, including Shirell and Bush. ""Ridgway claimed that he killed [Shirell and Bush] in King County and later transported the bodies to Oregon,"" Washington County authorities said. ""Shirley, Denise and Tammie were all reported missing from the Seattle area. Angela was reported missing from the Portland area, and detectives have not received any information that she was in the Seattle area prior to her death."" But, the statement said, ""because of the close proximity of Tammie's and Angela's remains to the remains of Shirley and Denise, the locations where their bodies were disposed of and the time frame for the murders, detectives believe that Gary Ridgway is responsible for their deaths."" Ridgway's plea agreement in Washington state would not preclude his prosecution in Oregon, Washington County sheriff's Sgt. David Thompson told CNN. Although Ridgway has denied responsibility, detectives are reviewing the cases and re-examining evidence collected over the years, police said. Anyone with information about either Girdner or Liles during 1983, 1984 and 1985 is asked to contact the Washington County Sheriff's Office. The Green River case takes its name from a river south of Seattle where Ridgway began dumping his victims in 1982. Most of the women were prostitutes. Ridgway has said he targeted prostitutes ""because I thought I could kill as many as I wanted without getting caught."" He said he killed because he hated prostitutes and didn't want to pay them for sex, and claimed he killed so many women he had a hard time keeping them straight.","Teenager's misplaced remains are identified more than 20 years after her death .

"NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN) -- Waiting in line is part of life in post-storm New Orleans, especially when it comes to health care. ""There are no great options for the people that we see in this clinic,""  says Dr. Ravi Vadlamudi. Nearly every day, people stand in front of Common Ground Health Clinic in the Algiers neighborhood. Patients come from all around the city to get free health care in this former corner grocery store with barred windows. They come early, wait eagerly in line, sometimes swapping stories of where they were during Hurricane Katrina. Two years later, people still talk about Katrina.  It's the greeting, the icebreaker, the common bond. Where were you? Where did you work before it hit? Where did you evacuate to? Quickly, conversation turns to the painfully slow rebuilding of the city: violent crime, lack of schools; a shortage in housing, access to doctors. Sitting in the makeshift waiting room, patients chat with each other and the clinic workers, often shaking their heads in disapproval or disbelief. ""It's so tough in this city. We can't get back on our feet."" ""We've thought about leaving, but we don't know where to go or how to get there."" ""I'm glad we found out about this place. Maybe we can finally get some help."" Before the storm, the uninsured turned to the famed Charity Hospital. Housed in a mammoth art-deco building, it provided reliable medical care for the poorest inhabitants of the city. The storm floods engulfed the first few floors of Charity and the doors were shut for good. Only three of the city's seven hospitals have reopened. Only one of those reopened facilities operates at full pre-storm capacity. A mere fraction of the doctors have returned to the city. Dr. Ravi Vadlamudi is one of them. He's the medical director of Common Ground. Everyone here calls him Dr. Ravi. ""Our clinic is a tiny Band-Aid to a small piece of a huge problem,"" he says. It's hard to believe that there was ever a time when Dr. Ravi felt unneeded in New Orleans. As the storm approached two years ago, he sought refuge in his home state of Michigan, with his young daughter, Anjali, and his wife, who is also a physician. In the immediate aftermath of Katrina, he returned to the city as quickly as he could. Within days, he cleaned up their apartment and reopened the doors of his private family medicine practice at Tulane in the East Bank area of New Orleans. His office sat virtually empty. Back then, like many New Orleanians, he wondered, ""Would anybody ever come back? Is our life over here?"" But soon he crossed over to the West Bank. He waded through the chaos by joining a team of street medics, community activists and volunteers providing care to whoever came, whenever they needed it. At first, it was a tent, providing emergency services in a city without any emergency rooms. Today, it's a full-service health clinic serving about 200 patients a week, with four full-time staffers and a good number of volunteers. Two years later, it is a cornerstone of health care in this city.  Watch Dr. Sanjay Gupta report on New Orleans' looming mental health crisis » . ""There are no great options for the people that we see in this clinic,"" says Dr. Ravi, who spends two days with Common Ground and maintains his private practice for the rest of the week. ""When people think about a free care clinic they think about poor lazy people and that's a complete misperception. Most of our patients have one job, if not two jobs -- they just don't have insurance."" A huge multi-layered problem is the best way to sum up health care in New Orleans. A recent study published by the American Medical Association found a 47 percent increase in the death rate in 2006.  ""Our study showed an excess mortality, meaning these are people that would not have died, had it not been for Katrina,"" said Dr. Kevin Stephens, who is director of the New Orleans Health Department and the study author. Stephens was forced to use newspaper obituaries for the study because state vital statistics were unavailable to him at the time. He maintains that the death rate in New Orleans is still elevated. But Dr. Fred Cerise, the secretary of Louisiana Health and Hospitals, disagrees on the exact rate of the increase and says there is no sustained elevation in the death rate. But doctors on the front lines, like Vadlamudi, say an elevated mortality rate isn't surprising, ""People end up in the hospital sicker and end up dying probably more often. In addition, I think that without the health-care resources, people get fed up, they don't wait in the lines."" From fewer doctors, sicker patients, scarce health services to violent crime, it's hard not to think about death in this city. ""I'd run out of fingers and toes if I tried to count how many close friends or patients have been murdered, attacked, jumped, shot at or left for dead,"" says Dr. Ravi. He and his wife are expecting their second child soon. He says his biggest concerns are good schools and the threat of violent crime. Dr. Ravi says they make the choice to stay in New Orleans every single day. Some days, the choice to stay is easier as he sees progress with the clinic and his patients. Other days are more difficult -- such as the one last January when he learned of the brutal murder of his colleague's wife. ""I worry about [crime and violence] in my heart. We're staying and we're committed to this community, but it weighs on my mind every single day whether I may wait one day too long."" E-mail to a friend . A. Chris Gajilan is a senior producer with CNN Medical News.","Access to health care is still a big problem in New Orleans .

"(This Old House) -- A tide of foreclosed properties has been sweeping into the beleaguered housing market, bringing down property values, dislocating families, and sending municipal governments scrambling to manage the crisis. But some buyers see a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity in the gloomy headlines; they are buying up foreclosed properties at ultra-low prices. Real estate agent John Lynch of Keller Williams Greater Cleveland West says he has interested buyers calling from all over the country, and as far away as Israel. Some are buying in bulk. ""One investor I am working with right now wants to buy 200 houses all under 10K."" Would-be homeowners are not excluded from the bonanza. Despite economic fears and the struggling housing market, Tonya Perkins-Stoudermire of McMullan Realty in Cleveland says this may be an ideal time to think about the dream of first-time home ownership. She tells the story of a friend who waded into the foreclosure market and came out ahead. ""My girlfriend bought a house last summer. It has two baths, a two-car garage, and two fireplaces. She loves it. Her house is $350 a month, with taxes and insurance. She's in her late 40's and had been a renter all these years."" Those are the high notes, but these agents tell other stories, too. There's the one about a far-away buyer who learned he owned a bunch of vacant lots, instead of houses. ""It's not for the faint of heart,"" says Lynch. Lynch has seen the same house at foreclosure auctions more than once. ""That hurts us all,"" says Lynch. A check-in with real estate professionals, home inspectors, and federal housing officials offers these words to the wise on buying a foreclosed property. • Budget carefully. Agent Tonya Perkins-Stoudermire says don't let a small price tag lure you into a quick deal. Be sure to ask yourself a number of questions: Do you have the money for the extensive repairs these houses often need? ""Do you have a crew. If you plan to rehab and then rent, can you afford the house if you don't find a tenant? If you do your homework, there's little risk,"" says Perkins-Stoudermire. • See the house for yourself. ""You can't buy them sight unseen,"" says Bill Richardson, president of the American Society of Home Inspectors (ASHI). ""If you're an investor from Chicago and you're buying in Tucson, you'll need someone to evaluate the house in person."" This Old House: What to expect from a home inspection . • Look at the neighborhood. Your homework should include evaluating the neighborhood. You may not be able to recoup the cost of the repairs if the value of the house is depressed by widespread foreclosures or high crime in the area. Tonya Perkins-Stoudermire says she also encourages buyers to study the neighborhood's appeal at all hours, including at night.

Bill Richardson, of ASHI, says if a house hasn't been ""moth-balled"" carefully, a long list of ailments set in. ""The plumbing seals dry out, sewer gases back up, and bugs that are in the sewer get a chance to get into the house. That's true for the sinks, toilets, and washer drains,"" says Richardson. • Was it winterized? Don't turn on the utilities until you know the condition of the pipes. If the pipes cracked during a cold spell, water will leak into the walls, and mold could take hold when you turn the water back on. This Old House: Dealing with mold . • Look at the landscaping. ASHI's Bill Richardson warns, ""If the house has been neglected, untrimmed trees, vines and bushes contribute to the deterioration of the house."" Vines crawl into the windows, and tree seedlings send roots down into the foundation. ""It doesn't take very big trees to mess up pavers, and dead branches crash into the house,"" says Richardson. • Contract for a private inspection. Banks generally require a home inspection when lending money for a mortgage. But even if you're paying completely out of pocket for an ultra-cheap find, all the pros say it's crucial to get an up-to-date inspection. Richardson says previous inspections ""are only a snapshot in time,"" and conditions change dramatically. ""There's no caretaker on these properties. I've looked at quite a few,"" says Richardson. ""We've seen vandalism. We've seen previous owners steal cabinets and fixtures. Copper piping has been stolen."" In some cases an inspection will prevent further damage. For example, if inspectors determine the pipes are cracked, repairs can be done in advance. Richardson said inspectors charge $300 to $500. • Consider a HUD house. The Department of Housing and Urban Development is currently holding approximately 39,000 houses whose previous owners held mortgages insured by the federal government. HUD houses go to market about six months after foreclosure. Local governments get the first option to buy. After that, buyers who pledge to live in the house have the first opportunity to offer a bid. If the house is still on the market after a period of about 10 days, the listing is opened to investors. Owner occupants end up with about half of HUD's properties, according to HUD officials. A fraction of the total foreclosure market, HUD's inventory is concentrated in Georgia, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and other states where the mortgage crisis has been especially severe. But if one of these houses suits your fancy, HUD spokesman LeMar Wooley says the feds offer a few advantages. ""You will know the fair price of the property"" because HUD updates its appraisals regularly. It offers a ""property condition report"" too, though that report is not updated. Wooley is thus among the chorus of experts urging buyers to pay for their own home inspection before closing the deal. If HUD appreciates the value of a good inspector, inspectors likewise say HUD houses are better protected. ""The feds often take the steps to winterize the houses. They put anti-freeze in the traps, and drain the pipes. When HUD's involved it's a little bit better,"" says ASHI president Bill Richardson. • Don't expect to profit from a quick sale. Investors who buy intending to do as little as possible to a house, hoping to resell for a profit when the market turns around, may find little profit and a lot of headache. Some cities are cracking down on neglectful property owners, charging penalties that increase over time, and unmaintained homes lose value quickly. But real estate pros and housing officials report that, overall, investors are a welcome and all-too-scarce resource, and most are fixing up the houses they buy for rent or resell. What's more, investors and new owner-occupants might get the satisfaction of helping to turn a hard-hit neighborhood around. Get 2 Free Trial Issues .

"(CNN) -- American tourists heading to Mexico's Baja California state in the future can expect more police protection from a new task force, according to Mexican authorities. Mexican officials want to make sure the tourist traffic continues to flow into Tijuana. Officials from the Baja California cities of Tijuana, Ensenada and Rosarito gathered earlier this week to announce the creation of the task force, which will be made up of bilingual officers and which will be designed primarily to serve Americans. The initial plan, according to Ensenada Secretary of Public Safety Cesar Santiesteban, is to create a force that patrols a 50-mile tourist corridor from Tijuana through Las Playas Rosarito to Ensenada in Baja California, which is Mexico's northernmost and westernmost state. There were no immediate details as to when the task force would go into operation or how many officers would be in the unit. City officials in San Diego, California, said the city's police force would extend help in ways that Mexican officials deemed necessary in getting the task force up and running, including training the officers. ""We've always prided ourselves in our working relationship with our friends to the south,"" San Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders, said. ""When you look at it, we're really one community."" For a region whose reputation has been tarnished by ongoing drug-fueled violence, plans for task force couldn't come soon enough. Policing the drug war has proven complicated for Mexican authorities, including the military, and also hindered the tourism industry in Mexico. American travelers, who represented 80 percent of the country's booming $13 billion travel industry last year, are a critical part of Mexico's economy. In 2008, more than 18 million Americans visited the country, according to the Mexico Tourism Board. In some areas, hotels and local businesses are struggling to recover from low visitor numbers, according to the Mexico Tourism Board. Tijuana Mayor Jorge Ramos said tourism in Baja California in the past two years has remained steady, and the task force was set up to create a stronger police presence for tourists. ""We're here on this side of the border to invite you to our city and to [show you] we're making a lot of things ... better, and to make some progress in our city,"" Ramos said in a news conference in San Diego Monday.","Task force will be made up of bilingual officers; primarily will serve Americans .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A woman who suffers from multiple sclerosis lost her legal bid Wednesday to clarify Britain's laws on assisted suicide. Debbie Purdy and her husband Omar Puente pictured outside London's High Court. Debbie Purdy, 45, had launched a High Court challenge to determine whether her husband would face prosecution if he helped her end her life before her conditioned worsened. Purdy told reporters she was ""disappointed and surprised"" that the judges refused to interpret the 1961 Suicide Act, which says assisting someone in a suicide is a crime punishable by up to 14 years in prison. Purdy, speaking from a wheelchair beside her husband Omar Puente, said she would appeal. She has said she wants the option of assisted suicide if her pain one day becomes unbearable. Her case asked the judges to tell her at what point her husband would be breaking the law if she committed suicide with his help. ""I'm not prepared for Omar to break the law,"" she said. ""How can we make sure that we act within the law without potential prison sentences if they won't tell us under what circumstances they would prosecute?"" The suicide act says only that anyone who ""aids, abets, counsels or procures the suicide of another, or an attempt by another to commit suicide, shall be liable"" to be jailed for as long as 14 years. ""What does this actually mean, and how is the discretion to prosecute actually exercised?"" said Melissa Milner, a spokeswoman for Dignity in Dying, a charity that has worked on Purdy's case. ""Does it mean booking tickets? Getting medical records? Pushing somebody's wheelchair on a plane? Do these matters amount to a criminal offense?"" Dignity in Dying campaigns to give terminally ill patients the option of an assisted death so they ""would not be forced to contemplate dying before they are ready,"" according to the group's Web site. Wednesday's ruling comes amid a similar high-profile case in Britain. Dan James, 23, died in an assisted suicide in September, 18 months after he became paralyzed in a rugby training session. He had traveled with his parents to Switzerland -- where assisted suicide is legal under some circumstances -- where he took his life. British prosecutors are considering charges against his parents, who are now back in Britain. Purdy, who lives in the northern English city of Bradford with her husband, was diagnosed with primary progressive multiple Sclerosis in 1995, when she was 31. She is still able to do normal activities like cooking, cleaning and shopping, but she knows her physical condition is rapidly deteriorating. If her case is not resolved, Purdy said she may decide to go alone to Switzerland and commit suicide while she is still able to on her own. She said she would prefer making that journey much later, only once her condition deteriorates, so she can die with her husband by her side. ""I'll have to make a decision,"" she said. ""I'm not prepared for Omar to face potential jail, because if they won't tell us in advance (that) he can do X, Y, and Z without risk of prosecution, I can't risk that.""","Multiple sclerosis sufferer fails in legal bid to clarify UK assisted suicide law .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The pilot who landed a crippled US Airways jetliner on the Hudson River thought there would have been ""catastrophic consequences"" if he tried to make it to a nearby airport, a National Transportation Safety Board official said Saturday night. US Airways Flight 1549 remained in the icy Hudson River on Saturday. Instead, pilot Pilot C.B. ""Sully"" Sullenberger decided to ditch the plane in the Hudson River close to vessels moving about the water ""to improve chances of recovery,"" NTSB board member Kitty Higgins said. It was the first time the public heard comments from Sullenberger and first officer Jeffrey B. Skiles describing Thursday's emergency landing. Skiles was flying US Airways Flight 1549, bound for Charlotte, North Carolina, when he noticed a flock of birds less than 90 seconds after the plane had taken off from New York's LaGuardia International Airport, Higgins said. In an instant, the plane was rocked by loud thuds and both engines went out, Higgins said.  Watch the plane hit the water » . ""He commented on the formation, and he said the next thing he knew, the windscreen was filled with birds. There was no time to take evasive action,"" Higgins said. Sullenberger took control of the aircraft while Skiles began complicated procedures to try to restart the engines, Higgins said. Sullenberger thought the plane was moving ""too low, too slow"" to risk returning to LaGuardia through the maze of buildings. Nor did Sullenberger think the powerless aircraft could make it over the densely populated New Jersey area to Teterboro, Higgins said. ""There could be catastrophic consequences if we didn't make it,"" she quoted Sullenberger as saying.  Watch CNN's Lisa Sylvester report on the pilots » . City officials, passengers and aviation experts have lauded Sullenberger and the flight crew for their handling of the landing and also praised first responders who acted quickly to minimize passengers' injuries in below-freezing temperatures. All 155 people on board the plane survived. ""These are both very experienced pilots. They knew what they had to do,"" Higgins said. Neither Sullenberger nor Skiles attended the news conference. Earlier in the day, the NTSB revealed the content of communications between the cockpit and controllers at LaGuardia in the brief period during which the incident unfolded. ""This is cactus 1549, hit birds, we lost thrust in both engines,"" Sullenberger told controllers at approximately 3:27 p.m. Thursday. ""We're turning back towards LaGuardia."" Controllers immediately began preparations to clear a runway for an emergency landing, but less than a minute later, Sullenberger reported that the aircraft wouldn't make it, Higgins said. The last communication from the plane to controllers, Higgins said, was the pilot saying, ""We're gonna be in the Hudson.""  Watch a former pilot tell how to water-land a plane » . Higgins also quoted two of the flight's attendants, who were in jump seats at the front of the aircraft when they heard a loud thud shortly after takeoff. ""It was a sound that neither one of them had ever heard before,"" Higgins said. ""They said all the engine noise ceased. They described it as complete silence, like a library."" Efforts to raise the jetliner from the river proved successful late Saturday, as cranes lifted it clear of the water about 11:30 p.m. ET following several hours of work by crews in frigid conditions. Video from the scene showed the right side of the aircraft with the engine intact but its covering mangled. It was not clear visually whether the damage was from an in-flight incident or from the landing impact. Investigators planned to tow the plane on a barge to an undisclosed location for their examination.  Watch water wash over the plane » . Searchers using sonar think they have found the left engine on the river bottom. Divers will try to confirm the finding, Higgins said.  Watch workers begin the retrieval process » . The flight data and cockpit voice recorders -- both crucial to determining exactly what happened Thursday -- remained on the aircraft, which was still largely submerged in the Hudson River but was secured to moorings. Strong currents and cold water thwarted divers' efforts to retrieve the recorders from the tail section of the jetliner, Higgins said. Also Saturday, authorities released audio and transcripts of two 911 calls from people who said they saw that the plane was in trouble.  Listen to callers report plane in the river » . One caller said he saw the plane descend and reported hearing a loud noise shortly after the aircraft took off. ""Oh, my God! It was a big plane, I heard a big boom just now. We looked up, and the plane came straight over us, and it was turning. Oh, my God!"" a man calling from the Bronx told a 911 operator at 3:29 p.m., three minutes after the plane left LaGuardia. Minutes later, at 3:33 p.m., a woman called 911 and reported seeing the plane in the water. ""A plane has just crashed into the Hudson River,"" she told an operator. ""A US Air big DC-9 or -10 has crashed into the Hudson River. ... Oh, my gosh!""

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Civilians continued to flee Pakistan's northwest in droves Monday as government troops prepared to engage Taliban militants in the crisis-hit Swat Valley. Thousands of displaced Pakistani civilians have flooded refugee camps. More than 360,000 Pakistanis have fled their homes since May 2, the United Nations has reported. ""Obviously more people are on the move,"" said Ariane Rummery, a spokeswoman for the U.N. human rights commissioner. ""Not everyone is registered."" Thousands of vehicles fled Swat Valley on Sunday, where up to 15,000 Pakistani troops are preparing to move against approximately 5,000 Taliban militants, a regional official said. In neighboring areas, Pakistan's military is continuing an offensive against the Taliban along its western border with Afghanistan, a military statement released Sunday said.  Watch the latest on the conflict » . The military has been releasing regular reports saying it has killed Taliban militants in the region, but it has produced little evidence of the successes it claims. Journalists have not been permitted to observe the offensive and the army has not shown bodies of the militants it says it has killed. Curfews have been imposed in the conflict zone, but are relaxed periodically to allow civilians to travel. It is not unusual now to see rickshaws and cargo trucks filled with fleeing civilians, rolling down Pakistan's main east-west highway. Vehicles are not allowed back into the region, which has led to a shortage for those trying to leave. Meanwhile, at least 25 boys stranded at the Khpal Kor Foundation orphanage in Swat Valley had to flee the district capital, Mingora, on foot Sunday, according to director Mohammed Ali. He said local government officials told him there were no vehicles to evacuate the children. The 175-kilometer (110-mile) journey from Mingora to the western city of Peshawar normally takes about three hours by car. The boys walked for several hours, but had to spend the night in a madrassa -- a religious school -- outside of Mingora, because authorities had re-established the curfew. Camps for the displaced have sprouted up throughout the country's northwest, with hospitals and humanitarian groups struggling to keep pace. In other developments, a suicide car bomber attacked a Pakistani paramilitary checkpoint outside Peshawar on Monday, killing a Frontier Corps soldier and three civilians, said Ali Sher Khan, a Corps spokesman. Troops fired on the suspicious vehicle as it approached, according to Khan.","U.N.: More than 360,000 Pakistanis have fled their homes since May 2 .

"(CNN)  -- Argentina star Lionel Messi scored twice as Barcelona thrashed Atletico Madrid 5-2 in the Camp Nou to maintain their perfect start to the Spanish league season. Messi put Atletico to the sword with two goals in the Camp Nou. Messi celebrated his lucrative contract extension at Barca, sealed on Friday, with a superb display against a flagging Atletico who have made a poor start to the season. New signing Zlatan Ibrahimovic put Barcelona ahead in the second minute, just after Thierry Henry had hit the post in a frenetic opening. Messi then got in the scoring act, rounding goalkeeper Roberto Jiminez after being played through by midfielder Xavi. Daniel Alves scored the third for the reigning European and Spanish champions with a powerful free kick on the half hour mark. Ibrahimovic, who is finding his feet after a slow pre-season campaign, then found Messi who charged past a static Atletico defense before finding Seydou Keita for a tap-in on 41 minutes. To complete an exciting first half, Sergio Aguero pulled one back for the visitors after a mistake by Sergio Busquets. Atletico gained respectability after half-time as Diego Forlan scored six minutes from time, but Messi rubbed it in with the fifth during injury time. In other action on Saturday, Real Mallorca briefly went top before Barcelona won the late kick off, beating promoted Tenerife 4-0. Mario Saurez, Artiz Aduriz, Julio Alvarez and a late Pierre Webo penalty gave Mallorca three points as they matched their best ever start to a Primera Liga season with two wins and a draw. Espanyol moved off the bottom with their first victory of the season with a 3-2 away win at Deportivo la Coruna, while Alvaro Negredo scored his first goal for Sevilla who beat Osasuna 2-0.

"EL PASO, Texas (CNN) -- Sitting in high school, math and history lessons never captured Danny Santos' imagination. The drug-fueled streets of the Texas-Mexico border provided his education, and he was an excellent student. Danny Santos, 21, works two part-time jobs and still doesn't make as much as he did as a drug mule. Santos says he became one of the thousands of American and Mexican teenagers recruited into the dangerous world of drug smuggling. ""I didn't care. I had no conscience,"" Santos said at a boxing gym in El Paso, Texas. ""You're young, and you're naïve, and you think it's easy."" Santos' journey into the underworld of teenage drug smuggling offers a glimpse into how drug cartels lure teenagers into doing their dirty work. US. Customs and Border Protection officials in El Paso and San Diego report that in recent months, they've seen a rise in the number of juvenile drug smugglers getting busted at border checkpoints. They're often called mules. These teenagers are usually hired only to smuggle drug loads across the border. It's a short drive or walk that offers quick cash but can carry serious consequences.  Watch how teens get drugs across the border » . Drug cartels ""just need someone who can legitimately cross the border,"" said Bill Molaski, the El Paso Port Director for U.S. Customs and Border Protection. As an American, Santos could freely cross the El Paso-Juarez border and not raise suspicion. At age 15, Santos says, he met ""a guy"" at a party who introduced him to drug kingpins in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. ""You start off as a driver,"" Santos said. ""People feel like they can trust you, then you move up to something bigger."" Two weeks later, he got a $4,000 job offer to drive his first load of marijuana across a bridge into El Paso. It was the beginning of a four-year smuggling career. ""I can't say I wasn't nervous,"" Santos said. ""You kind of project yourself into another time of happiness or joy. ... You just have to forget you have something illegal in the car."" In all, Santos says, he earned $50,000 making about 20 mule runs, driving right through heavily guarded border checkpoints. Santos, who is now 21, says he was arrested once but spent only a few days in jail. He said charges were dropped. Because he was younger than 18 when he was arrested, and juvenile cases are sealed, CNN could not confirm his story through court records. Young smugglers don't fit a stereotype. Several sources said that both American and Mexican teens are lured into the work. Teenage boys and girls alike are involved. Many smugglers come from middle-class families. ""There's a lot of money in the trade, a lot of inducement for a lot of young people to get involved,"" El Paso County Attorney Jose Rodriguez said. His office is responsible for prosecuting juvenile smugglers. Federal and state authorities say drug cartels recruit young smugglers from schools. Depending on the size of the drug load that's being smuggled, a kid can be paid a couple hundred dollars up to $5,000. Mexican officials say cartels have placed classified advertisements in Mexican newspapers with cryptic messages offering young people a job with good salary and benefits. A phone number is included in the ad. The officials say a cartel member sets up a meeting to determine whether the kid is up to the job. But Rodriguez offers a chilling reason why teenagers should avoid the lure of easy money. ""We had a kid here who lost a load and had some of his toes chopped off,"" Rodriguez said. Santos says he got out of the smuggling business two years ago. Now he spends every day training at a boxing gym in El Paso. Boxing and smuggling can both be vicious worlds, but at least boxing is legal. However, it's a slow climb to the top of the boxing world. He's chasing the golden dreams of boxing championships and hoping to make more money boxing than he did smuggling. Santos is working two part-time jobs, and he says it takes him two months to earn the money that he used to make in one day of drug smuggling. He spent almost all the money he made smuggling. But he has no regrets. ""The peace of mind is good,"" Santos said after a bruising workout. ""I sleep good, eat good. I feel better now.""","Danny Santos, 21, says he made $50,000 in four years as a drug mule .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A man walks around the side of a building, footsteps falling in time to the heartbeat of a driving pop soundtrack, pulls out a pistol and guns down another man. Tony Servillo as arch-manipulator and seven time Italian Prime Minister, Guilio Andreotti, in Paolo Sorrentino's ""Il Divo."" A montage of grisly murders follows, all with the same infectious pop song pounding in the background. It's edge-of-the-seat stuff and it's only the opening sequence of gifted Italian director Paolo Sorrentino's biopic of Italian politician Giulio Andreotti, ""Il Divo."" Sorrentino's film chronicles the career of probably the most important and controversial politico in Italy's recent history. But, more than that, it pins Andreotti to the specimen board and dissects his character without mercy. The film caught the eye of the judges at Cannes Film Festival last year where it picked up the Jury Prize. Predictably, Andreotti didn't react well to the film. ""He was very angry,"" recalls Sorrentino. Now 91 years-old, Andreotti has been Prime Minister of Italy seven times. His Christian Democrat Party was the leading force in Italian politics as a one-party system for four decades. The rules of the game were shattered in the early 1990s by ""Tangentopoli""  or Bribesville -- a corruption scandal that laid bare some of the government's unsavory practices, ruining careers and resulting in the suicides of some leading politicians. Andreotti himself was implicated in illegal activities, including connections to the Mafia, but was finally acquitted of all charges. Today, he is a senator for life. Something of the man's influence in all spheres of Italian public life becomes clear when Sorrentino -- who says he is not a political director, ""only in this case"" -- explains how hard he found it to fund the film. ""In Italy nobody wanted to finance the film because everybody was scared,"" Sorrentino told CNN. ""He has been a very powerful man for many years."" Sorrentino managed eventually to secure funding from a private source. ""It is not easy for Italian companies to put money in this project, so we did it with the private money of very courageous individuals,"" he said. Sorrentino picks up the Andreotti story at the beginning of the 1990s, just prior to his implication in the scandal, as he is about to assume power for the seventh time. A good deal of ""Il Divo's"" success lies in a stunning portrayal of Andreotti by Naples-born actor Toni Servillo, who is a veteran of three of Sorrentino's other films including 2006's ""The Consequences of Love."" Servillo's Andreotti is a stiff, impassive tortoise of a man. With a hunched back, skinny sloping shoulders and strange drooping ears, Andreotti appears physically frail. He is beset by headaches -- indeed, the opening scene of the film shows him with a head full of acupuncture needles trying to get rid of one -- a taste of the mix of drama and humor that informs the rest of the film. But where the body is weak the will is strong and in Andreotti's wit and cunning intelligence -- ""I know I'm an average man, but looking around I don't see any giants"" -- there is a sense of a man who can and will do anything to stay in power. ""I have always wanted to make a film about Andreotti,"" says Sorrentino. ""He is so psychologically complex that everyone has been intrigued by him over the years. ""It's a political film but at the same time a film about a complex character from a psychological point of view."" For a long time, though, Sorrentino was convinced that the vast amounts of literature written about the man could never be distilled into a structure that would work on film -- ""It made my head spin,"" he remembers. While Sorrentino almost had too much material to mine while researching Andreotti's public life, it was impossible to get access to details of his home life. Sorrentino had to go on instinct and imagine life behind the scenes for the great man. Something that made aspects of Andreotti's response to the film very puzzling. ""He told everything was false, a lie, about his public life and at the same time he said the film was very precise about his private life,"" recalls Sorrentino. ""But all the public things in the film are documented. It's on record that the events took place. ""The trials, the letters, the diary of Aldo Moro, the Prime Minister who was kidnapped by the Red Brigade and held in captivity for 55 days. (Andreotti was Prime Minister at the time and decided not to negotiate with the terrorists and they killed him.) ""And about the private life I invented everything."" One of the most surprising things about the 39-year-old director's film is the soundtrack. Full of rock, pop, electronica -- ""Nux Vomica"" by The Veils an indie band from New Zealand and ""Toop Toop"" by French electro artists Cassius -- mixed in with classical music like Vivaldi and Sibelius. It's incongruous but it delivers a hefty emotional punch. ""The idea was to make a rock opera about a man very far from rock,"" says Sorrentino. ""I didn't want to do a traditional biopic.""","Paolo Sorrentino's ""Il Divo"" chronicles the career of Italian politician Guilio Andreotti .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- An autopsy on the body of actress Brittany Murphy was conducted Monday, the Los Angeles County coroner's office said. Authorities have said the 32-year-old appeared to have died Sunday of natural causes, and there was no sign of foul play or trauma. ""Naturally occurring diseases could be found in any person that could lead to death,"" said Capt. John Kades of the coroner's office. The office is looking into Murphy's medical history. A final report could take up to eight weeks. The cause of death will not be released until the toxicology report is concluded, said the coroner's office. That process can take weeks. Police also are conducting an investigation, which includes robbery and homicide detectives looking at what was in her home, said Los Angeles Police Department spokeswoman Norma Eisenman. Murphy was pronounced dead at 10:04 a.m. PT (1:04 p.m. ET) Sunday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, hospital spokeswoman Sally Stewart said. She is survived by her husband, British screenwriter Simon Monjack, whom she married in 2007. Statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show the leading cause of death for American women in Murphy's age range is unintentional injury. Malignant tumors are second, followed by heart disease and suicide. The often bubbly, free-spirited actress appeared in such films as ""Clueless,"" ""8 Mile,"" ""Don't Say a Word"" and ""Girl, Interrupted."" She also lent her voice to animated works, such as the movie ""Happy Feet"" -- in which she also sang -- and a regular role on the animated TV series ""King of the Hill."" ""The sudden loss of our beloved Brittany is a terrible tragedy,"" her family said in a statement issued by her publicist. ""She was our daughter, our wife, our love and a shining star. We ask you to respect our privacy at this time."" Funeral arrangements are pending, the family said. Fans have taken to Murphy's official Facebook page to issue their condolences. ""She was a great actress and was going to go far in her career! She will be greatly missed!"" read one post. Former boyfriend -- and ""Just Married"" co-star -- Ashton Kutcher was one of many celebrities to post his reaction to the news via Twitter. ""2day the world lost a little piece of sunshine. My deepest condolences go out 2 Brittany's family, her husband, & her amazing mother Sharon,"" Kutcher tweeted. ""see you on the other side kid,"" he added later. Singer-actress Jessica Simpson tweeted: ""Brittany Murphy was an incredible ray of Light to so many people. Her smile was contagious. My prayers are with her family and loved ones."" Actress Alyssa Milano, who did a USO tour with Murphy in 2003, wrote: ""She was a sweet soul, with a lot of talent and heart."" Murphy was best known for her work in a string of romantic comedies earlier this decade, including playing lead roles in ""Uptown Girls"" alongside fellow Georgia native Dakota Fanning, and ""Little Black Book"" with Holly Hunter and Kathy Bates, but her movie roles had declined in recent years. Last month, Murphy was reportedly fired from ""The Caller,"" a movie she was working on in Puerto Rico. Her representative issued a statement to news outlets disputing the report, saying, ""She was not nor has she ever been fired from any job big or small. ... [Due] to creative differences Ms. Murphy and the production mutually parted ways,"" according to People magazine. Murphy was the subject of tabloid gossip after she transformed from a pudgy brunette in 1995's ""Clueless"" to a petite, lithe blonde who graced the cover of such magazines as Cosmopolitan in 2005. She frequently denied rumors of an eating disorder and plastic surgery. Her love life also was fodder for gossip sites as she broke two engagements in 2004 and 2006, then married Monjack after four months of dating. ""All these ridiculous people came out and said all this nonsense when we got married, [but] thank God we had the substance and the history within that to [say], 'Yeah, whatever!'"" Monjack told People in 2008. ""We still don't understand what happened. It's made us laugh, it's made us cry, but it's made us stronger.""","NEW: An autopsy was conducted Monday on the body of Brittany Murphy .

"(CNN) -- The phrase ""it's cold outside"" doesn't begin to describe it. With the mercury well below zero in parts of the Northeast, people in New York and the New England states are facing some of the coldest temperatures the region has seen in years. So, just how cold is it? Temperatures in Boston dropped to 2 degrees below zero Monday morning, according to CNN meteorologists. To the south, in New York, it was even worse, with the morning temperature sitting at 6 below zero. Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick has urged people in his state to take extra caution in the dangerously cold weather. In a statement released on Monday, the governor announced that he had put state agencies on high alert to respond to any public safety and public health issues that may emerge. ""We are also reaching out to cities and towns to make sure they are prepared, and have pledged support, where needed,"" the statement said. Patrick is working with the United Way and the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency to provide services and assistance to residents across the state. Boston might be considered cozy by its neighbors to the west, according to CNN meteorologist Sean Morris. In North Adams, Massachusetts, Monday morning's low was 20 below zero. In New York state, the cold weather caused trouble for travelers. Schools in North Syracuse had to close after several dozen of the district's 136 buses failed to start, according to local media reports. ""We could not chance putting them out on the road and then having them stall and not be able to pick up the students,"" school district director of transportation Mike Janisch told CNN affiliate WSYR. Amtrak had to shut down part of its service in New York as well. A statement sent out on Monday said the sub-zero temperatures had caused some signals, switches and equipment to freeze, leading to the cancellation of some services in the region. Northwest of Albany, temperatures dipped to 30 below in Indian Lake, and minus 22 in Gloversville. Other Northeastern states are also facing bitter cold. In Mount Washington, New Hampshire, temperatures dropped to 35 below zero. But if you think these temperatures are approaching global record lows, you're way off. On July 21, 1983, temperatures dropped to a bone-chilling 129 degrees below zero in Vostok Station, Antarctica -- the coldest temperature ever recorded on Earth.","Temperatures well below zero in parts of the Northeast .

"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Political corruption in Zimbabwe threatens efforts to save millions of people from malaria in the southern African country, according to aid agency officials. HIV-positive 13-year-old orphan Evans Mahlangu, left, and his brother Edmond, 8, had to jump Zimbabwe's border with Mozambique to get anti-retroviral drugs. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria has demanded that Zimbabwe's government return $7.3 million placed in the country's reserve bank to pay for the distribution medicine that can cure malaria, according to the group's spokesman. A senior western diplomat in Zimbabwe told CNN he believes the money was taken by Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe's government to fund political activities. He accused reserve bank governor Gideon Gono of involvement. ""This could put millions of people in Zimbabwe at risk of malaria in the current malaria season,"" said John Linden, spokesman for the group which is a leading international financing institution for those diseases. Linden said his group has given Zimbabwe until Thursday to repay the money or else no more aid will be sent to the country. ""At this stage we do not have confidence in the reserve bank's ability to release the money when needed, so we have demanded that all the money be released immediately,"" Linden said. The money was intended to train thousands of health workers to distribute the malaria cure, medicine that is already available but sits on shelves. CNN's Kim Norgaard in Johannesburg, South Africa contributed to this report.","Corruption in Zimbabwe threatens efforts to tackle malaria, aid officials say .

"Tucson, Arizona (CNN) -- When President Barack Obama said Wednesday night that Rep. Gabrielle Giffords had opened her eyes for the first time since being shot on Saturday, an overflow crowd of nearly 30,000 people at a memorial event erupted into cheers that the congresswoman may have heard in her hospital room. Obama said he learned of the eye-opening from Giffords' husband, astronaut Mark Kelly. ""She knows we're here, and she knows we love her,and she knows that we will be rooting for her throughout what will be a difficult journey,"" the president said at a memorial in Tucson to honor the victims of the shooting. Giffords is still listed in critical condition at the University of Arizona's University Medical Center. Suspect Jared Loughner allegedly fired at her first, striking her in the head. As soon as Obama finished his remarks, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, let it be known that she, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Florida, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, were in the room at the time, along with Kelly and Giffords' parents. ""It was like witnessing a miracle,"" Gillibrand told CNN. ""Debbie and I were telling her how much she was inspiring the nation with her courage, her strength, and we were talking about the things we wanted to do as soon as she was better,"" the senator said. ""I said, 'We'll have another night out for beer and pizza with your husband.' And Debbie started talking to her about their house in New Hampshire, just talking about all the things we wanted to do, and all of a sudden she started to struggle to open her eyes. So Mark saw that and said, 'Open your eyes, Gabby, open your eyes.' She kept struggling and struggling and Mark just kept encouraging her. And within a moment she literally opened her eyes."" ""The doctors couldn't believe it,"" Wasserman Schultz said. ""Mark started encouraging her, saying 'Gabby, give me a thumbs up if you can see, if you can see me, touch my ring, touch my wedding ring.' She started doing that,"" she said. ""We just kept talking to her and talking to her about the fun we've had with her, and so then she opened her eyes more. She went from opening her eyes really just in slits to opening them nearly fully. It wasn't very long, and then they closed again. But it was just absolutely -- it was the most incredible, aside from my kids, the most incredible experience."" Giffords kept her eyes open ""for a moment,"" Gillibrand said -- ""maybe 30 seconds, maybe 60 seconds."" ""You could see she was focusing and Mark said, 'Gabby if you can see me, give me the thumbs up,' and not only did she give the thumbs up, she literally raised her entire hand,"" Gillibrand later told CNN. Doctors sent them out of the room shortly after that, Gillibrand said, because Giffords needed to rest.","Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand: ""It was like witnessing a miracle""

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Kenny Morrison soaked in life from his beachfront home. A top chef at a trendy L.A. restaurant, he served dinner to the Hollywood stars, including A-listers. Kenny Morrison got hooked on painkillers after getting dental work in 2003. ""I lost everything,"" he says. But within a couple years, he lost it all. He got hooked on pain medication after some dental work. His fix was codeine, Vicodin and OxyContin -- all prescription medications -- to help him get through the day. At one point, he even had a tooth removed unnecessarily so he could get a prescription for pain medicines. ""At the height, I was taking probably 20, 25 a day,"" he says. ""It got to the point where I lost the wife, the house, and I was living in a bad part of L.A. in my truck. And I went from taking a couple of codeine all the way to taking OxyContin."" Morrison didn't buy his drugs on a street corner or get them from a dope dealer. He got them mostly from dentists he had never met. He says he'd scroll through the phone book calling dentist after dentist until one would prescribe him pain medication. ""I kind of found out on my own that a dentist will prescribe you painkillers over the phone, instead of a doctor who you would most likely have to go in and see,"" he says.  Watch addicts turn to dentists » . Dr. Jay Grossman, a dentist in the Los Angeles area, says he routinely gets calls from people seeking painkillers. ""The moment somebody hangs up the phone on me, I know that they're literally going down the book. They're calling the next one in the Yellow Pages, hoping that someone will write them a prescription,"" he says. ""If you're an addict, one of your resources would certainly be a dentist."" Grossman sits on a disciplinary committee for the California Dental Association. He says the calls typically come at the end of the day. The user describes pain in his mouth and insists on medication fast. Red flags go up and Grossman says he begins asking a series of questions to ""put it back in their ballpark."" When he asks how many pills they need, sometimes the answer is: ""Forty or 50 should do just fine,"" Grossman says. He tries to set up an appointment for the next day, so he can see the patient in person. Most times, they hang up after he grills them. ""I don't think doctors of any sort -- whether it's a dental professional or one of my medical colleagues -- should be doling out prescriptions in that quantity, like M&Ms. That's not what it's there for,"" he says. ""I would like to think the vast majority of my colleagues are doing the honest, ethical and moral thing."" According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, nearly 7 million Americans are abusing prescription drugs, more than the number who are abusing cocaine, heroin, hallucinogens and ecstasy combined. The number of painkiller addicts has nearly doubled from 2000, when 3.8 million Americans were hooked, the DEA says. The misuse of painkillers represents three-fourths of the overall problem of prescription drug abuse. The DEA says addicts get the drugs from ""doctor shopping,"" online pharmacies and other Internet sources, theft from pharmacies and, yes, traditional drug dealers. ""All DEA registered practitioners and dentists registered with DEA must adhere to state laws and regulations as well as federal laws and regulations when dispensing or prescribing a controlled substance,"" says DEA special agent Gary Boggs. But the DEA says only one in every 10,000 doctors loses his or her controlled substance registration each year as a result of DEA investigations into improper prescribing. James Stillwell, the executive director of Impact Drug and Alcohol Treatment Center in Pasadena, California, says he believes it's much more prevalent than authorities realize. He says dentists, doctors and veterinarians all become targets of addicts. ""It's an easy way to get your hands on an opiate-based drug, a painkiller, for recreational use,"" Stillwell says. ""If you have an addict that wants to get high, ... he's going to find ways and means to do that."" There's another troubling aspect of addicts on painkillers prescribed by doctors, he says. These addicts don't think they have a problem because they have prescriptions in their hands. ""It helps you legitimize it -- not just in terms of family and loved ones, but what your head is saying to you,"" Stillwell says. ""It's a way to elude the stigma of being a drug addict."" Grossman says the DEA has done a good job in the last 12-18 months of cracking down on dentists who may be over-prescribing pain medicines. According to the DEA, 38 states have enacted legislation to create a database for physicians and pharmacists to prevent abusers from obtaining multiple prescriptions. Grossman says the DEA notifies dentists and questions them when their prescriptions for painkillers reach high numbers. ""They're actually following up,"" he says. But he says for a dentist to come before his local disciplinary board, the board first needs to be notified that a dentist may be acting out of line -- and a drug abuser typically isn't going to turn them in. Grossman believes the issue has come under scrutiny in the last year because ""of the celebrities that have been passing away due to drug overdose."" Heath Ledger and Anna Nicole Smith had each taken a lethal combination of prescription drugs. He said dentists, doctors and pharmacies constantly need to be on alert for people trying to use medical professionals as their drug dealers. ""Just writing a prescription for the pain is not the answer,"" Grossman says. ""There's a moral and ethical code that we have to follow."" As for Morrison, he says he has been clean for a year after going through Impact's program. He's now the head chef at the treatment facility that saved his life. It has been five years since his life fell apart. He's trying to repair his relationship with his daughter and his ex-wife. He wants others to avoid the painful painkiller path he took. ""My body craved it, and I lost everything -- everything,"" Morrison says. ""It's hard to understand how big of a problem this is. My message is it's a disease and it needs to be addressed."" CNN's Traci Tamura contributed to this report.","Kenny Morrison learned he could get pain pills from dentists without seeing them .

"(CNN) -- This Friday, Muslims around the world will bid goodbye to a long month of fasting with three days of feasting and festivities. The faithful usher in the holiday, Eid al-Fitr, with joyous community prayers, acts of charity, visits from far-flung relatives, gift-giving and hearty greetings of ""Eid Mubarak,"" or happy Eid. This year, however, one controversy has cast a pall over the celebrations for many Muslims: a Florida pastor's threats to burn copies of the Muslim holy book, the Quran, on the anniversary of the September 11, 2001, attacks. ""Although the joy of Eid is still there, the sense that we Muslims belong in this society as equals seems to be under threat and there is a somber note in everybody's preparations,"" said Wasima Reza of Raleigh, North Carolina. She said she will take her children to Eid prayer services so they can feel a sense of community. ""I want them to be proud of the fact that they are Muslims and feel that they can practice their religion in their own country, without fear,"" she said. Ayaz Hyder of Piscataway, New Jersey, is one of many who feel the holiday -- one of the most important in the Islamic calendar -- has been hijacked by whether or not the Rev. Terry Jones, the head of a small church in Gainesville, Florida, will go ahead with his Quran burning plans. ""He got what he wanted out of this. His 15 minutes of fame,"" he said. ""I will have more people at my place for Eid this year than this guy has congregants but yet he's still dominating the headlines."" Indeed, from Indiana to Indonesia, the planned burning was on many Muslim minds. In Indonesia, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono urged the United States and United Nations to act as he read a statement from the palace grounds on Eid day Friday. ""I am of course aware of the reported cancellation of the deplorable act by Rev. Terry Jones. However, none of us can be complacent until such despicable idea can totally be extinguished,"" he said. In Afghanistan, sporadic demonstrations broke out Friday, with the largest demonstration in the northern province of Badakhshan where hundreds of Afghans protested outside a NATO base. NATO officials said two people were hurt, but provincial authorities said one person was killed. The holiday bids goodbye to Ramadan -- a month of dawn-to-dusk abstinence from food, drinks and other sensual pleasures. Muslims believe the Quran, the religion's holy book, was revealed to Prophet Muhammad during Ramadan more than 1,400 years ago. Eid is one of two major holidays in Islam, alongside another called Eid al-Adha. The latter commemorates the prophet Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son for God. The night before Eid, entire communities gather on rooftops, scanning the sky with giddy anticipation to see if they can see the crescent of a new moon. Preparations for the feast begin as soon as it is sighted. In Tawab Qurayshi's home in Lashkar Gah, Afghanistan, the menu includes rice, stew, kabobs and freshly baked Afghan cookies. Like Muslims elsewhere, Qurayshi and his family members don new clothes -- to symbolize a fresh start, he said. The fun continues on the second day with a uniquely Afghan tradition: egg fights. Men, armed with hard-boiled eggs, try to break each others'. The one whose egg cracks receives light-hearted ribbing. It is a joyous time when even the Taliban cease fighting -- a rare respite in a war-ridden country, he said. ""The day itself is, and has always been, about yummy foods, new outfits,"" said Sumi Mehtab of New York. ""This whole Quran burning issue casts a negativeness on what should be a totally joyous occasion and I'm annoyed at how dumb people can get."" But Ottawa, Canada, native Siffan Rahman wasn't going to let the controversy ruin her holiday. ""I turned off the TV because I don't want to hear about it anymore,"" she said. ""Eid should be about celebrating, house-hopping, stuffing our tummies and staying up late with friends. And that's what I'm going to do."" CNN's Atia Abawi in Kabul, Afghanistan, and Kathy Quiano in Jakarta, Indonesia, contributed to this report.","Eid al-Fitr marks the end of Ramadan -- dawn-to-dusk abstinence from food and drinks .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN)  -- The Arab world is among the worldwide audience that has been closely watching as events in Iran have unfolded over the past week. Protesters fight running battles with motorcycle-mounted militia members Saturday in Tehran. ""In all honesty, I am amazed by these Iranians,"" Egyptian human rights activist and blogger Walid Abbas posted on his Twitter page. ""I have no green t-shirt"" Abbas tweeted Saturday. He was referring to the color worn by many supporters of opposition candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi, whose supposed failure to win last week's election sparked the wave of unrest that has gripped the nation. Watching the events unfolding in Iran on Twitter, Youtube and other social networks, the Egyptian activist said he is learning from the Iranian activists. He said he does not support Moussavi because he is part of the Mullah system. ""We are not with Moussavi,"" Abbas tweeted, ""We are with the Iranian people and their demands."" Taghlob Salah, a 24-year-old Iraqi student at Baghdad Law College, told CNN that the Iranian youths who make up most of the protesters can be inspiring to Iraqis, despite cultural differences.  See images of the clashes Saturday » . ""Despite the difference that we have with Iran and the fact that many Iraqis don't trust their Persian neighbor, we are still Muslims and at the end of the day that matters a lot,"" he said. ""We will look at this phase in Iranian history and learn, for sure and I can say that we will learn from them, 100 percent."" Iraq and Iran are culturally linked because their populations are predominantly Shiite Muslims, as opposed to Sunni Muslims who make up the majority of most Arab countries. Salah credited the Internet for giving everyone involved a chance to have their voices heard. ""There are so many Iraqi groups all over Facebook,"" he said. ""The world is evolving; we are developing our approach to our surroundings."" Abdel Bari Atwan, editor of the London-based pan-Arab newspaper Al-Quds Al-Arabi, expressed dismay over the continued protests. He called on Moussavi to be ""responsible enough to protect his people and avoid bloodshed, instability and confrontation in his country that may rupture the Iranian internal unity spreading chaos throughout the region."" Atwan said Ayatollah Ali Khamenei made it clear in his speech during Friday prayers that his patience had run out and he praised the supreme leader for having displayed ""leniency"" in his dealings with the protesters, but predicted that that leniency would not continue. iReport.com: Share images from Iran . Abd Rahman Rashed, editor of the Saudi-owned, London-based Arabic daily Al-Sharq Al-Awsat, expressed a different point of view. In an editorial published Saturday, Rashed directed comments to Arab supporters of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, whose landslide victory in last week's election is being challenged by Moussavi and his supporters. ""No matter what happens, Iran did technically change and will shift its course in a great way,"" Rashed wrote. ""It is over,"" he said. ""Iran the one system, the street and the agenda is over."" They may not understand Farsi or why some Iranians voted for Moussavi, Mehdi Karrubi or Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, but Arabs can surely relate to the passionate shouts of ""God is Great!"" And ""Down with the dictator"" in defiance of Iran's theocracy. Relations between Iran and Arab states have always been tense: through its proxies, Iran sometimes accuses some of the leading Arab states, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia, of being subject to the whims of Western imperialism and of failing to confront America and its ally, Israel, in the region. Rashed credited Iranians for speaking with courage against their government's funding of controversial organizations like Hezbollah, Hamas and anti-government groups in Yemen and elsewhere. He said Iranians voted against the current system because they don't want the government to dedicate the country's budget to ally itself to such organizations instead of focusing on the average citizen. Some Arab states look to Iran as a regional superpower that can support them financially, militarily and politically in their confrontation with the international community. Those states include Syria and Sudan, which support organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah -- deemed terrorist organizations by the United States -- that are used as a proxy to challenge America and Israel in the region. Some Arab states have long warned that Shiite Iran wants to spread its power across the Sunni-dominated Arab world, causing more mistrust and friction between the Persian nation and the Arab world. Recently, Egypt and Morocco accused Iran of attempting to spread the Shiite faith among its Sunni population and creating Shiite converts and activists in their communities and in the rest of the Arab world -- a charge that Iran has denied.","Arab world has closely watched as events in Iran have unfolded over past week .

"(CNN) -- British authorities said Tuesday they are conducting a criminal investigation into an American man charged in federal court with smuggling weapons into England. Steven Neal Greenoe is suspected of buying more than 60 firearms in North Carolina and transporting them to England on at least nine occasions, according to court documents. In September, a federal grand jury handed up a 43-count superseding indictment against him. He was arrested in July, when authorities found another 16 firearms in his baggage. TITAN, a task force in Britain's North West region for serious and organized crimes, said in a statement Tuesday it was also investigating Greenoe. ""This is a complex investigation involving law enforcement agencies across the North West of England,"" Detective Chief Superintendent Simon Leach, who heads the task force, said in the statement. ""We are working closely with our colleagues nationally and with partners in the United States. The availability of firearms poses a serious risk and our investigation will be continuing over the coming weeks and months."" After being brought into the country, allegedly by Greenoe, the firearms were then sold in Britain, court documents said. An undercover police officer bought three of them from two men for 10,500 pounds (about $16,500). The Times of London reported Tuesday that British and U.S. authorities held crisis talks after Greenoe, 37, was arrested. Some of the firearms are unaccounted for, the Times reported, and of those recovered, ballistics tests show one was used in a drive-by shooting in Manchester, England, in October. Britain's Home Office said Tuesday it and the government continue ""to work very closely with international partners, including counterparts in the United States, on all matters relating to security. Measures to protect the public and tackle the threat posed by terrorism and international crime are constantly kept under review."" Greenoe always flew into Manchester's airport, according to the complaint. Officials there told CNN that arriving passengers are not screened unless they are stopped by customs. The TSA on Tuesday declined comment on the case, citing pending litigation. Firearms are not prohibited from checked luggage, according to the TSA's website. However, firearms must be declared to the airline, and the guns must be unloaded and in a hard-sided container. Firearms may not be taken out of the United States, according to the International Trade in Arms Regulations unless the person carrying them has registered with the State Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls. On July 19, as authorities were investigating Greenoe, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement attache in London told the agency that neither Greenoe nor his company, Jolie Rouge consultants, had been granted an export license from the office. Greenoe allegedly took the guns overseas by breaking them down into pieces and spreading the pieces over multiple bags in his checked luggage, according to a federal complaint filed in July. The TSA on Tuesday declined comment on the case, citing pending litigation. Greenoe's defense attorney, Mark Edwards of Durham, North Carolina, declined comment to CNN on Tuesday. Edwards previously told the Times in the story published Tuesday that ""Steve's a bright young man, very sociable, a bright guy, well read, well-educated, well-traveled. He's been all over the world. He's an interesting man to deal with and not my average client at all."" On May 3, according to the complaint, Greenoe was interviewed at the Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina, airport by TSA officials after a screen of his luggage showed pieces of ""multiple firearms."" Greenoe told authorities that ""he was a salesman, and that he had just gone to the Raleigh gun show and that the guns were broken down and not in a working order,"" the complaint said. After checking the serial numbers on the guns, the TSA allowed Greenoe to continue with his flight, according to the complaint. Authorities believe ""Greenoe was attempting to elude law enforcement and U.S. customs officials by stating that the items in his luggage were ... inert and non-working samples,"" the complaint said. ""In fact, these items were fully functional firearms that had been disassembled and disguised to appear as anything but a functional firearm."" A native of New Orleans, Greenoe lived in Shrewsbury, about 70 miles southwest of Manchester, the Times reported. Confronted and questioned at the Raleigh airport on July 25, Greenoe initially said they were non-working samples that belonged to Jolie Rouge, according to the complaint, but later told authorities that he bought the weapons ""as a means to provide high quality firearms to his employees while providing overseas maritime protection,"" since he could not buy high quality weapons overseas. Charges against Greenoe include failing to notify a common carrier of arms shipment; exporting firearms from the United States without a license; smuggling firearms outside the United States; and falsifying an ATF form. In a hearing in July, a federal magistrate declared Greenoe a flight risk and ordered him held. Greenoe waived his appearance on the superseding indictment after it was handed up, according to court records. Several motions in the case were filed under seal in November. Greenoe is currently being held in the Pitt County Detention Center in Greenville, North Carolina. CNN's Jeanne Meserve and Antonia Mortensen contributed to this report.","Steven Greenoe is charged in a 43-count indictment .

"(CNN) -- Employers in Denmark have started paying compensation to women who have developed breast cancer after working night shifts. Studies have shown that nurses working night shifts have an increased risk of developing breast cancer. Thirty-eight eight women have so far received payments via their employers' insurance companies, the Danish National Board of Industrial Injuries told CNN. To qualify for compensation, women must have developed breast cancer after having worked at least one night shift a week for 20 to 30 years. The amount of compensation depends on the severity of claimants' illness and their ability to work. The move came after the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), part of the World Health Organization, concluded that night work is ""probably carcinogenic to humans,"" in October 2007. Ulla Mahnkopf developed breast cancer after 30 years working as a flight attendant for SAS, a job where night shifts were the norm. She told the BBC that had she known the effects of night working she wouldn't have flown for so many years. The IARC classifies the cancer risk of night work as ""Group 2A"" -- the same as using sun beds -- and just one group below confirmed carcinogens like asbestos and mustard gas. The IARC reviewed published scientific literature and found that long-term night workers have an increased risk of breast cancer. Dr Vincent Cogliano, Head of the IARC Monographs Program, told CNN that the evidence in humans is limited to breast cancer because researchers have historically studied nurses and flight attendants. Cogliano said he would like to see studies carried out on different types of workers in other industrial settings. He added that the human studies are consistent with laboratory research that exposes animals to changing patterns of light and dark to mimic the conditions of humans working at night. It is thought that night work can disrupt the circadian system, which can alter sleep patterns, suppress melatonin production, and affect genes involved in tumor development. ""This is a very important topic and it needs more research,"" said Cogliano. ""Working at night or disrupting your sleep cycle is a widespread phenomenon and it is important to understand the health implications. There could be other cancers or other health implications involved."" Those most likely to do night shifts are those working in the health-care industry, hospitality, industrial manufacturing, news media and security workers.","Danish women who got breast cancer after night work get compensation .

"(CNN) -- ""Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover."" -- Mark Twain . Italian mountaineer Reinhold Messner, whose expeditions have inspired others to seek adventure . Adventure comes to those who seek it. Some are born with an adventurous streak, an insatiable curiosity that can only be quelled through discovery, while others seek out adventures as a means of conquering the demons within: fear, boredom, stagnation, a sort of dry rot of the soul. We see adventurous people as being somehow different from ourselves: stronger, braver, tougher, fitter. They are versions of our best selves: the doers in life, the fearless, those who go over the mountain and come back to tell us what's on the other side. While we may think the true adventurers are a species apart, we are all adventurers at heart -- yet sometimes the urge is stifled by modern life. The lust for adventure is planted in childhood. How many of us sat enthralled under the blankets as our parents read us the adventures of the Famous Five, ""Treasure Island,"" ""Where the Wild Things Are,"" ""The Swiss Family Robinson,"" ""Tarzan"" and ""Peter Pan""? Children weaned on such stories may be forgiven for assuming adulthood is one long adventure that swings wildly between jungles, swamps, deserted islands and alpine heights. Yet modern life is increasingly sedentary and safety-conscious. The desire for comfort and convenience ameliorates our contradictory urge to explore. A few have it thrust upon them: stranded in an inhospitable place, lost in a jungle or called up for combat -- and they find themselves dropped in an adventure that they may not have chosen; but for the main part, adventure comes to those who seek it. Dr. James Thompson, a senior lecturer in psychology at University College London, says seeking adventure is more common ""amongst people who are extroverted, who are outgoing, who are sociable, because one of the things they need -- apart from the excitement of people -- is excitement generally."" But if you think adventure is something that only happens to other people; that you are too unfit to climb a mountain, too scared to sail across the open sea, too nervous to travel through a country where you can't speak the language; perhaps you should rethink. After all, having an adventure could be good for you. Psychologists have linked adventure-seeking with a range of positive qualities. Adventure can: . Following the stories of this age's greatest adventurers such as polar explorer Douglas Mawson, Everest climber Edmund Hillary and mountaineer Reinhold Messner, we are encouraged not just to follow their paths up mountains or along rock faces -- they also inspire us to take more risks, to seize more from each day. Who could fail to be inspired after watching CNN interview the world's greatest living mountaineer, Reinhold Messner? In 1980, Messner was the first person to ascend Mount Everest alone without supplementary oxygen. Later, he crossed Antarctica on skis. He tells CNN anchor Becky Anderson: ""I'm a normal person, a totally normal person, and I was really lucky in my life to have to have the opportunity to follow my dreams. So in the beginning I was a rock climber, and all my enthusiasm, my energy and my willpower went into rock climbing."" Many young people are naturally adventurous -- throwing their energy and enthusiasm behind sport, hobbies and travel. Witness the explosion of school leavers taking gap years (a year off in between school and university or the workforce), with the destinations becoming more and more exotic and activities accompanying the travel designed to expand their mind as well as their horizons. But later in life, we can wake up and find our lives leeched of adventure. We may be loaded down with a mortgage, kids or a demanding job. Adventure then becomes something we prefer to read about rather than live. We fall into the trap of the armchair traveler and become transfixed by all the journeys we didn't make. Instead of setting out on our own expeditions, we read Joe Simpson's account of his near-death mountaineering experiences in ""Touching the Void."" Or we follow Sebastian Junger's account of wild sea adventures in ""The Perfect Storm."" But while we are great armchair adventurers, a craving for the real thing can stir in us when we feel the need to change and shake things up. Women in their 40s are leading the charge towards adventure. A survey released by the Adventure Travel Trade Association in March 2007 said today's typical adventure traveler was ""female and fortyish."" ""Women make up the majority of adventure travelers (52 percent) worldwide, with the most common destination being South America,"" said the trade association. The survey of travelers from 35 countries also found that people aged 41 to 60 are the highest participating age group in adventure travel. A survey by YouGov in the UK has identified a new subset of British -- the Nifty Fifties. They've had the responsible jobs and raised their children -- and now they want adventure. Tesco Life Insurance has noticed: ""They've decided to take the five star version of the student gap year, encompassing all of the adventure with none of the discomforts. Neither burgeoning waistlines nor graying hair is going to hold them back."" Some older people are inspired to seek adventure by their children's gap year experiences. Others just want to spend their kids' inheritances. In a survey of older people carried out by Tesco Life Insurance they compiled the Nifty Fifty wish list. Adventure is a common component to their aspirations, the most popular of which are noted below: . Tony Wheeler, one of the founders of guidebook giant ""Lonely Planet,"" is now an aging baby-boomer, yet he still pops up in Iran, a place that has recently dominated headlines the world over for all the wrong reasons. In a recent piece in UK newspaper The Observer, he also recommends holidays in North Korea, Iraq and Afghanistan. Messner now is 63 years old and although he no longer has the strength of his youth, he is still setting himself challenges. ""So my challenge today is this one (setting up a museum), I will finish this one and afterwards I will invent a new challenge and it will be not on Everest and not in Antarctica it will be probably in a mental dimension because mentally we can go very far also in later years,"" he told CNN. But the yearning for adventure can strike at all ages. Dave Wroe, 33, and Penny Bradfield, 28, both gave up exciting jobs in the Australian media to travel. They are spending April and May in Iran and have already braved trekking in the Amazon, train travel across India, diving in Syria and traveling in Columbia. ""I see adventure as going beyond something you feel comfortable with. If you are uncomfortable going to the end of your street and you go beyond this, then you are being adventurous,"" said Wroe. Wroe has a point. You don't have to emulate the deeds of Messner to be an adventurer. The spirit of adventure can infiltrate all areas of your life. You can infuse life's ""ordinariness"" with an adventure: cooking a meal that you may not have tried before, walking to work on a different route, striking up conversation with someone at the office whom you perceive to be intimidating. Successfully pushing your natural boundaries can lead to increased confidence. ""The general things which determine whether you start being adventurous is your personality and your youth. But once you start noticing that you have been able to overcome a challenge, it becomes a reward in its own right,"" said Dr. Thompson. For Messner, adventure now takes place on the ground, with establishing a climbing museum and being elected a member of the European Parliament. Speaking to CNN with the mighty mountains behind him, there was a restless but playful look in his eyes. He said he wasn't the type to sit around, drink beer and collect his pension in his old age. Adventure is so much a part of his life, it seems, that it is an urge that can only be extinguished by death. And so while the strength in his body diminishes, the adventures will take place in his mind. Messner is an extraordinary man, and while most of us would struggle to climb Everest with or without oxygen, we can still emulate his spirit of adventure in our daily lives.","Italian mountaineer Reinhold Messner has inspired others to seek adventure .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- After months of delays the trial of the lone surviving suspect in the Mumbai terror attacks finally got underway Friday. Soldiers patrol in Mumbai on the eve of the trial of a key suspect in last year's attacks in the Indian city. Mohammad Ajmal Kasab is charged with 12 criminal counts including murder, attempted murder, and waging war against India. Police say he was caught on surveillance camera holding a gun as he stalked and killed people inside Mumbai's main train station. Kasab is also accused of shooting down people at Mumbai's Cama hospital. Kasab is one of 10 Pakistani nationals who police say reigned down terror on Mumbai, India's financial capital, for four days and three nights. Police say the men gunned down more than 160 people in the attack as they took over three luxury hotels and a Jewish center and shot up several other places including a popular restaurant. Police say Kasab is the only suspected gunman caught alive. In his opening statements Prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam read from Kasab's alleged confession about how he trained for the attack. Nikam said, ""The terror attack was in order to capture Kashmir."" Kashmir has long been a source of tension between India and Pakistan. The dispute over who owns the territory has resulted in wars between the two countries. It's alleged Kasab and his cohorts traveled to India from Pakistan by boat for the sole purpose of attacking India. Late in the day Kasab's newly appointed defense attorney Abbas Kazmi said Kasab was now retracting his statements, saying he confessed under police pressure. Kazmi also argued that Kasab was under age at the time of the attacks and should be tried in Juvenile Court, but Judge M.L. Tahilyani disagreed saying Kasab was older than 17 at the time of the attack. The prosecutor put Kasab's age at 21. The trial was supposed to get underway April 15 but in a stunning turn of events the original court appointed defense attorney for Kasab was dismissed from the case that day. Tahilyani removed lawyer Anjali Waghmare from the case saying she failed to disclose pertinent information to the court. The court said it was brought to its attention that Waghmare was listed as an attorney for a victim of the Mumbai attacks who was seeking compensation from the state. That victim also happens to be a witness against Kasab in this trial. In court Waghmare said she did not agree to take the victims case but had talked to him. She also said she was unaware that he was listed as a witness in Kasab's trial. The next day the judge appointed Kazmi, who was in the court during the proceedings observing the trial as a member of the Indian Bar Association.","After months of delays trial of suspect in Mumbai terror attacks finally gets underway .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Ernest Hemingway hasn't lived here in over 50 years but Finca Vigia is still his home. In the garden there's his boat ""the Pilar"" used to hunt marlin and then Nazi subs off Cuba during World War II. Scrawled on a bathroom wall next to a scale are the daily records of what the writer weighed. Lizards and frogs he caught rest in jars filled with formaldehyde. Antelopes and buffalo heads taken as trophies from African safaris decorate the walls. Yellowing Time and The Field magazines are still on the shelves. Now a museum, a visitor to Finca Vigia or ""lookout farm,"" could be mistaken for thinking Hemingway might walk in the door at any second. ""Our philosophy was to recover the environment and surroundings,"" said Ada Rosa Alfonso Rosales, the museum's curator. ""This was not just a mere house, this was his home."" Hemingway lived in the home on a hilltop on the outskirts of Havana from 1939 to 1960. The years were pivotal ones for the famed American writer and for his adopted home of Cuba. Life.com: Ernest Hemingway's life in photos . In 1953, Hemingway won the Pulitzer Prize for his book the ""Old Man and the Sea"" about an aging Cuban fisherman's epic duel with a marlin. Six years later revolutionaries led by Fidel Castro took control of the island, leading to the eventual breakdown in relations with the United States. Battling depression, Hemingway killed himself in Ketchum, Idaho in 1961. Even though the Finca Vigia receives over 40,000 visitors a year, the house nearly fell victim to Cuba's unforgiving environment. ""This is a very humid climate,"" Alfonso said. ""We're on top of a hill where winds and even hurricanes batter the house."" In 2005, the National Trust for Historic Preservation called the house ""a preservation emergency,"" citing roof leaks and shifting foundations that endangered the house. One of the people who came to the house's rescue was Jenny Phillips, the granddaughter of Maxwell Perkins, the editor who first pushed for Hemingway's work to be published and worked with the writer for the rest of his life. ""I realized we could help because of my connection to Ernest Hemingway through my grandfather,"" Phillips said. ""That we could bring about a collaboration between the United States and Cuba which after 50 years of embargo little collaboration has happened between the two countries and yet here was this shared cultural legacy, deeply appreciated by the Cuban people and the American people."" Phillips started the Finca Vigia Foundation, navigating the bureaucracies of two countries and restrictions of the U.S. embargo to bring restoration experts to the project. One of those experts was home improvement icon Bob Vila, who is also Cuban-American. Vila said helping to save Hemingway's house transcends politics. ""It's the best cultural bridge we could have hoped for between the American people and the Cuban people. And I emphasize people, I am not talking governments,"" Vila told CNN. ""The Cuban people and the American people have a warm relationship that goes back many decades. It's a very important project."" Life.com:  Fidel Castro mingles with celebrities . In $1 million renovation, the Cuban government restored the main house on the property. Curators estimate another $1 million is needed to save a collapsing guest house on the property, repair Hemingway's cracked swimming pool and build a workshop to restore thousands of original documents. Until then, restorers are carefully packing up Hemingway's letters and writings to protect them from further decay. ""He gathered ideas and wrote about them in the margins in the books,"" Phillips said. ""And that 'marginalia' has never been seen before by scholars outside of Cuba."" Eventually those writings will be digitized and exhibited at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in Boston, Massachusetts. Already, Hemingway's Cuba writings have solved one mystery for Jenny Phillips. ""What I always noticed was that they called each other 'Dear Mr. Perkins, Dear Mr. Hemingway,' she said. ""Then one day they started saying 'Dear Max, Dear Ernest."" How did that happen?"" A letter from Cuba following Hemingway's father's suicide in 1928 provided the answer. ""Hemingway was extremely distraught,"" Phillips said. ""There's a post-script in that letter, 'For God's sake will you unmister me anyway .' "" ""Perkins was quite a bit older than Hemingway,"" his granddaughter Phillips said, ""and who Hemingway felt safe with and nurtured by, so this was a deepening in their relationship.""","Ernest Hemingway lived at Finca Vigia outside Havana for over 20 years .

"(CNN) -- At least 20 people were killed and six injured Wednesday in a mine explosion in northeastern Colombia near the border with Venezuela, the government-run Colombian Institute of Geology and Mining, known by the acronym Ingeominas, reported. ""At this time, personnel from Ingeominas are at the scene of the accident dealing with the emergency with a group of institute rescue workers aided by the 5th Brigade of the national army, who brought in a helicopter for possible rescue efforts and to transport the victims,"" the institute said in a written statement. Earlier, a spokeswoman for the national civil defense agency said that more miners could still be in the mine, although an exact number was unknown. Hellen Garcia said that authorities believe as many as 30 could have been affected by the explosion. Garcia said five injured people were taken to two hospitals, but one of them died. Four bodies were taken out of the mine, she said. The remaining miners are 1,200 meters, or almost 4,000 feet, below ground, and the rescue operation by civil defense, Red Cross and government crews was expected to last through Thursday, Garcia said. Yamile Rangel Calderon, mayor of the municipality of Sardinata, said the mine is known as La Preciosa, or The Precious One. ""This is one of the oldest mines in the region and one that has some of the best safety and quality controls,"" she said. ""They have been exporting coal for many years."" Calderon identified five of the miners who died as Manuel Aparicio, Gustavo Mendez, Gustavo Garcia, Jorge Luis Valdivieso and Nelson Velosa Fuentes. The blast happened around 7 a.m. in the district of San Roque, Alvaro Silva, a government official in Sardinata, told the government radio service. An accumulation of methane gas apparently caused the explosion, the governor of the Colombian state of North Santander told the radio service. A 2007 explosion in the same coal mine killed 31 people, Garcia said.

"(CNN) -- Authorities say they believe a young female who died after a shootout outside a Walmart store was connected to the shooting suspect. The female -- thought to be a teenager --- was one of two people killed in the Sunday afternoon shooting in Port Orchard, Washington. ""We don't think she was just a store patron unrelated to the incident. We believe she was associated with the suspect, but we have not been able establish the relationship yet,"" said Kitsap County Sheriff's Office spokesman Deputy Scott Wilson. The female remained unidentified. Two sheriff's deputies who were injured in the shooting were recovering from non-life-threatening injuries Sunday night. The sheriff's office said in a statement Monday that both were in satisfactory condition at a hospital. ""They both are going to live,"" Wilson said. Three sheriff's deputies responded to the Walmart store Sunday after getting a call about a suspicious person ""from a bystander who had concerns about a person inside the store,"" Wilson said. Officers responded about 3 p.m. Sunday, the sheriff's office said. The deputies approached one man outside the store's south entrance, but the man ran from the scene. ""(The deputies) called to him and said, 'Hey, we need to talk to you,'"" Wilson said. ""He turned around and shot at them."" The Monday statement said, ""For reasons not yet known, the suspect turned and fired multiple shots at the two pursuing deputies with a semi-automatic handgun. Both deputies were struck by the suspect's bullets and unable to return gunfire."" However, a third sheriff's deputy approached from behind the store, rounded the corner and shot the suspect, the statement said. The man was shot and later pronounced dead in the Walmart parking lot. Authorities Monday did not release his name, age or other details about him, saying they were in the process of confirming his identity and notifying his relatives. The female, who was fatally wounded, ""was in close proximity to the gunman at the time of the shootings,"" the statement said. ""Based on witness statements and other evidence, investigators believe that the gunman and the young woman were together and knew each other. However, their exact relationship has not yet been established. Also unclear is how the girl was struck by gunfire."" She was transported to a hospital and pronounced dead, authorities said. The process of identifying her was under way Monday as well. Wilson described the situation as ""somewhat chaotic"" but ""stabilized."" ""There is no danger to the community at this point,"" he said. ""We think that all persons (who were) involved ... have been accounted for."" The Washington State Police were taking over as the lead investigative agency in the case, and the Kitsap County Sheriff's Office requested assistance from the FBI. The female sheriff's deputy who shot the suspect was placed on administrative assignment -- a routine step in officer-involved shootings -- pending an investigation. The incident occurred near one of the retail giant's stores in Port Orchard, a town just west of Parkwood. Located on Sinclair Inlet, Port Orchard is about 30 miles north-northwest of Tacoma and across Puget Sound from Seattle. The store was locked down for about 20 minutes immediately after the shooting with and had about 100 people inside, Walmart customer Mike Lambert told CNN affiliate KIRO.

"(CNN) -- The cost of repairing flood damage in Australia will top AUS $5.6 billion (US $5.58 billion), according to Prime Minister Julia Gillard, who proposed a one-year tax to help fund the reconstruction. ""The great floods of this summer have been a national tragedy, not just a natural disaster, because of the awful loss of human life,"" Gillard said Thursday. ""The great floods of this summer have destroyed billions of dollars of wealth and robbed us of billions of dollars of income. In time they may prove to be the most expensive disaster in Australian history."" Gillard said the money will come from $2.8 billion (US $2.79 billion) in spending cuts, $1 billion (US $995.6 million) in delayed infrastructure projects and $1.8 billion (US $1.79 billion) raised through a progressive, one-year income tax on people earning more than $50,000. ""The levy will apply only in the 2011-12 financial year ..."" Gillard said. ""People who were affected by the floods will not pay this levy."" Flooding in Australia, primarily in the state of Queensland, has affected more than 3 million people, making it one of the most costly disasters in the nation, the federal treasurer said over the weekend. The cost of the damage surpasses past tragedies like major bushfires two years ago and floods in the 1970s, Treasurer Wayne Swan said. The floods have devastated crops, tourism, retail and manufacturing, and have disrupted major urban areas like Brisbane, according to Swan. ""One of the biggest casualties is likely to be our coal exports, with many mines shut down in big coal mining regions like the Bowen Basin, and supply chains severely hampered,"" Swan said. ""While this will be partly offset by higher prices, the loss of production will be hit much harder."" Swan said the government has already made about $227 million in disaster recovery payments to people who have been affected by the floods.","Money to pay for flood damage will come from spending cuts, delayed spending and a tax .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli police and security services have arrested four Palestinian men in connection with the December slaying of American tourist Kristine Luken, authorities said. The four suspects are Palestinians from the villages of Tarkumieh and Tzurif near Hebron in the southern West Bank, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. They will be charged Wednesday with murder in Luken's death, and also with killing an Israeli woman, Neta Sorek, in February 2009. They also will be charged with the attempted murder of Luken's friend, Kay Susan Wilson, and the attempted murder of another couple, Rosenfeld said. The four admitted carrying out the crimes, Rosenfeld told CNN, and told police the motive was revenge for the January 2009 killing of Hamas official Mahmoud al-Mabhouh in Dubai. Al-Mabhouh, a founding member of Hamas' military wing, was found dead in his Dubai hotel room. The Israeli Mossad is widely suspected in his death. DNA from the crime scenes also directly connected some of the suspects to the crimes, Rosenfeld said. Four other men were arrested on suspicion of being accomplices to Luken's murder. Luken was killed while hiking with Wilson, her friend and co-worker at a Christian ministry, in a forest near Jerusalem. Luken's body was found after Wilson stumbled into a picnic area with her hands bound, bleeding from multiple stab wounds and asking for help. Authorities believe the two women were approached by the suspects, who asked them for water, then were attacked a few minutes later. Wilson told authorities they were bound and gagged, then Luken was stabbed to death. Wilson was also stabbed multiple times but played dead until the suspects left. Luken and Wilson, a British citizen living in Israel, both worked for CMJ UK, a Christian ministry based in England.","4 other men are suspected of being accomplices .

"(CNN) -- A wanted Florida man shot and killed two St. Petersburg police officers Monday morning, and later the apparent assailant was found dead after police used a backhoe to tear through his house, authorities said. St. Petersburg Police Chief Chuck Harmon said the two slain members of his department were ""ambushed"" by the shooter, who they believe was a man wanted on an outstanding warrant for aggravated battery. A deputy U.S. marshal, who has not been identified, is ""doing well"" at a hospital after being shot twice, said Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal Tom Figmik. ""This crook, this criminal, this cop-killer ... did a terrible injustice to two of my people,"" said Harmon. ""I feel a lot of anger, I feel remorse for the families. ... It's a sobering reminder of what our officers face all the time."" The incident began around 7 a.m. Monday, when law enforcement from the city's Police Department, U.S. Marshals Service and Pinellas County Sheriff's Office went to a home in the west Florida city to ask a relative of Hydra Lacy Jr., who was wanted by police, about him. The woman told them that Lacy was upstairs in the attic and might be armed, according to Harmon. K-9 Officer Jeffrey Yaslowitz and a deputy U.S. marshal were shot at as they got near the attic -- where they intended to try to coax Lacy to surrender -- according to police. A gunfight ensued, during which another member of St. Petersburg's police force, Sgt. Tom Baitinger, was shot from above. While this was going on, a police search team entered the house and pulled out Yaslowitz, who was wounded but alive. ""I heard 150 to 200 gunshots during that exchange,"" said Harmon. ""You cringe, because you hope you don't send an officer (and) there's another death."" Yaslowitz and Baitinger were eventually taken to local hospitals, where they were pronounced dead. Even after the shots subsided, police were not able to locate the shooting suspect. They eventually used a backhoe to tear down one-third of the house and found a dead man. He was later positively identified, using fingerprints, as the 39-year-old Lacy, according to a statement from St. Petersburg police. Lacy had what police, in a statement, called a ""significant criminal history"" that included kidnapping, sexual assault and aggravated assault on a police officer. ""He was somebody we wanted to get off the street,"" Harmon said earlier Monday. ""And obviously, today you see why."" Baitinger, who was married, was a former detective who joined the St. Petersburg force nearly 15 years ago. Yaslowitz was a nearly 12-year veteran of the department and is survived by three children, ages 5, 8 and 12, and his wife. ""They served the people of this community with distinction, with passion, with resilience, with heroism,"" said Mayor Bill Foster. ""And they gave their lives today, so we can do what we can do."" The three law enforcement officers are among at least 11 shot nationwide in a 24-hour period. Four officers were shot and wounded at a Detroit police precinct on Sunday. Two Kitsap County, Washington, sheriff's deputies were shot and wounded at a Walmart in the town of Port Orchard. And officers in two locations -- Indianapolis, Indiana, and Lincoln City, Oregon -- were critically injured Sunday after being shot during traffic stops.

"(CNN) -- Sudan's president was seen smiling, dancing and speaking to a huge crowd of supporters Thursday, a day after a warrant was issued for his arrest on war crimes charges. Sudan's President Omar Hassan al-Bashir waves to supporters in Khartoum on Wednesday. The display of defiance came as international aid agencies were being ordered to leave the country in retaliation for the move by the International Criminal Court over six years of bloodshed in the country's Darfur region. The streets of the capital, Khartoum, were filled with people who raised their hands in the air to cheer President Omar al-Bashir, who raised both fists defiantly in the air. The crowd was filled with posters and banners featuring al-Bashir's face or the flag of Sudan. The one banner written in English read, ""We are all with al-Bashir."" Al-Bashir gave a fervent speech to the crowd, denouncing the United States, its Western allies and Israel. At one point, the crowd repeated in English, ""Down, down, USA!"" Music before and after the speech got everyone moving, including the president, who smiled broadly and raised his walking stick in the air. A camouflaged helicopter swooped over the crowd. Angry but peaceful demonstrations took place in cities throughout Sudan on Wednesday after the warrant was announced, according to the United Nations. Government air and ground forces conducted what the United Nations called a ""show of force"" in parts of Darfur, where the situation was ""calm but unpredictable."" The International Criminal Court at The Hague, Netherlands, issued the warrant Wednesday for war crimes and crimes against humanity. It accuses al-Bashir of complicity in a campaign of violence against the people of Darfur, in the west of the country. The United Nations estimates that 300,000 people have been killed in the conflict in western Sudan's Darfur region, and 2.5 million have been forced to flee their homes. Sudan has angrily rejected the accusations and the indictment. Kamal Obaid, Sudan's state minister of information and communications, called the ICC a ""white man's tribunal"" and the arrest warrant ""an insult."" It has told as many as 10 humanitarian groups to leave the country, and seized the agencies' assets, U.N. deputy spokeswoman Marie Okabe said.","Sudan's president seen dancing and smiling after war crimes charges issued .

"(CNN) -- Since the early days of pop music, the music industry has been searching for the secret formula to writing a successful song -- for that special alchemy that separates a Grammy-winner from a dud. For a period in the 1970s and 80s, the self-styled King of Pop Michael Jackson seemed to have stumbled upon it, but somewhere along the line he, too, seems to have misplaced it. Hit Song Science claims to be able to predict whether a song will be a pop hit . But now a piece of software claims it can compute whether a song has chart-topping potential, and a number of record companies and musicians are using Hit Song Science (HSS) to gauge whether they have a hit on their hands. The software, developed by Barcelona-based Music Intelligence Solutions, works by breaking down more than 60 elements of a song, including melody, harmony, tempo, pitch, octave, beat, rhythm, fullness of sound, noise, brilliance and chord progression, and compares it against a database of over 3.5 million past commercial hits. The program organizes songs into clusters with similar-sounding equivalents and then rates the song on a scale of one to ten, with a score of 7.3 being deemed likely to do well in the music charts. Curiously, clusters of songs do not necessarily contain songs that sound the same to the human ear, but from a mathematical perspective they share similarities. HSS analyzed music from Norah Jones' first album before she broke through and the program's algorithms placed her in a cluster with Linkin Park, Aerosmith and JayZ. If you have ever wondered why you sometimes find yourself humming along to some smooth jazz on the radio when you consider yourself a strict thrash metal fan only, then perhaps HSS has discovered the scientific answer. Besides Norah Jones, the program also predicted success for Mika, while ""Turn Your Car Around,"" a song penned by Ben Novak, a singer-songwriter from New Zealand, was rated as a potential hit by HSS, who recommended it to Sony Music in the UK. It eventually ended up as a vehicle for ex-Blue band member Lee Ryan and scored a respectable UK chart position of 16 in 2005. Record producer Carlos Quintero, director of Orixe and Jamm Records in Spain, believes that the software has a high accuracy rate. ""I was very skeptical when I was told about it for the first time,"" he says. ""I thought it was science fiction. ""But when we choose a tune for an artist and we like it and feel it will be a hit, the surprise is that 85 percent of the time the tracks we have chosen get a positive analysis from the software."" The emergence of hit prediction programs such as this -- New York-based Platinum Blue Music Intelligence provides a similar service -- raises concerns that the creative element of writing music would be eroded by breaking it down into mathematical algorithms. But Quintero claims the program in no way writes a song, it simply tells you whether it has the potential to be a hit. He says he mainly uses the software to tweak and refine songs so that he can maximize his chances of scoring a high chart position. ""There was a particular case where we had to revise the song as at first it wasn't completely right. Using the software, we managed to make it work,"" he explains. ""The problem with the software is that it can only indicate whether a song is suitable or not. It's up to the producer, the technical team and the artist to make it suitable in the first place."" Quintero has since become a member of Music Intelligence Solutions' advisory board, so he is bound to have a positive take on the service. Jimena Llosa, General Manager EMEA of Music Intelligence Solutions, claims the company has thirty to forty clients in the record industry in Europe and the U.S., but she says she cannot reveal who they are, citing privacy issues. CNN attempted to contact several record companies in London, but A&R departments claimed they had not heard of the service, suggesting either a certain coyness to admit using it or that it is not as widely used as Music Intelligence claims. The software can also be used as a way of recommending new music to audiences. In Spain, cellular phone company Orange is using the technology in its New Talents enterprise. Listeners can enter in their favorite songs and the program will suggest songs they might enjoy according to its cluster system. Óscar Sainz is one musician who has profited from this new way of connecting musicians with an audience.

"(CNN) -- A tug-of-war over the body of a former Venezuelan president was avoided Wednesday night when feuding sides of Carlos Andres Perez's family agreed for him to be buried in his homeland. In a statement, Perez's longtime partner, Cecilias Matos, said her family would not stand in the way of a Venezuelan final resting place for the ex-president. Perez, 88, died Saturday in Miami, Florida. Matos planned to have him buried there. Perez's wife in Venezuela, from whom he was long separated but apparently never divorced, had requested that Perez's body be sent to Venezuela. Earlier this week, a Florida judge signed a preliminary injunction blocking any burial until the matter was settled. Blanca Perez, the former president's wife in Venezuela, asked for the injunction. ""At the present time in Venezuela, love should be lavished to it and its great men,"" the Matos family said in the statement. ""Repatriating him is a way of giving (Perez) tribute, so neither Cecilia Matos nor her daughters, Maria Francia and Cecilia Victoria, will become an obstacle."" The statement continued, ""The Perez Matos family is absolutely convinced that Carlos Andres Perez belongs now to Venezuela, and all the Venezuelan people."" Perez, 88, served two terms as president of the South American country, the first from 1974 to 1979 and again from 1989 to 1993. During his final term, he survived a coup attempt led by Hugo Chavez, who spent two years in prison but later amassed support among millions of poor people angry about corruption and became Venezuela's president. Perez's second stint in power was marred by ""El Caracazo,"" a string of protests and riots against an economic package that the president had introduced. More than 200 people died in the violence. Perez was impeached on corruption charges in 1993, several months before his term was to end.","Carlos Andres Perez died Saturday in Miami, Florida, at age 88 .

"(CNN) -- Nigerian militants threatened to end their cease-fire not long after it began Wednesday because they claimed the government was threatening one of their camps. Before the cease-fire, MEND destroyed oil pipelines in Lagos during a night raid on Monday. The militant group MEND said seven military joint task force gun boats with heavily armed troops were headed toward a camp near the border of the coastal states of Delta and Ondo. ""If this information from a very reliable source within the JTF happens to be true, the cease-fire will be called off with immediate effect,"" the group's spokesman, Jomo Gbomo, said in a statement. ""We are monitoring the armada and sincerely hope that the planned attack will be converted to a war exercise."" There was no immediate response from the military to the threat to end the cease-fire.  Watch why the militants may end cease-fire » . MEND declared a 60-day truce earlier in the day following this week's release of its leader as part of an amnesty deal with the government. The response from Nigeria's military was positive, but muted. ""It's a welcome development, but we are continuing to do our normal assignment of maintaining law and order,"" said Col. Rabe Abubakar, a spokesman for Nigeria's military. MEND leader Henry Okah, who had been the group's main arms smuggler, was arrested in September 2007 in the Angolan capital, Luanda. He was later extradited to Nigeria and was in prison until Monday. The cease-fire put on hold MEND's ""all-out war"" on the government. The group is demanding a fairer distribution of oil wealth in the Niger Delta. It wants oil revenue reinvested in the region, instead of enriching those whom the militants consider corrupt politicians. Many of MEND's attacks have been aimed at oil and gas installations in the region. Okah's release had been a key demand of MEND before it would accept any government amnesty offer. MEND's statement said the group will put together a team of ""wise men and women"" to ""convey our demands to government."" ""A compulsory prelude to talks is the withdrawal of the military joint task forces from the Gbaramatu communities and the return of all the displaced persons back to their various homes,"" Gbomo said. ""Hopefully, the cease-fire period will create an enabling environment for progressive dialogue."" The militants have claimed attacks in recent years on oil platforms, chemical tankers, and oil pipelines. They have also kidnapped oil company workers. The repeated attacks have disrupted oil companies' operations in Nigeria, severely disrupting production and causing prices to climb. Covering 46,500 square miles (75,000 square km), the oil-producing region of the Niger Delta is about the same size as the Czech Republic or the U.S. state of Pennsylvania, according to the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). An area of rich biological diversity, the region contains the world's third-largest wetland with the most extensive freshwater swamp forest, according to the UNDP. More than half the area contains creeks and small islands, while the rest is rainforest, the UNDP says. At the same time, the Niger Delta produces the oil wealth that accounts for the bulk of Nigeria's foreign earnings, the UNDP says.

"(CNN)  -- Colombian President Alvaro Uribe on Thursday demanded that his ministers of the interior and defense get to the bottom of how a jailed top rebel leader escaped in the northeastern city of Arauca, Colombia. Colombian President Alvaro Uribe wants answers after a top ELN rebel was freed from prison. Gustavo Anibal Giraldo Quinchia, also known by his alias, ""Pablito,"" was freed Wednesday morning when a group of gunmen presumed to be rebels attacked a convoy transporting the prisoner to a court hearing. One guard was killed and another was injured in the incident. Giraldo is a high-ranking leader of the National Liberation Army, or ELN by its Spanish initials, who opposed peace talks with the Colombian government. He was arrested in January 2008. Uribe, who has held a strong stance against leftist rebel groups in his country, had strong words about the incident. ""There is no explanation for this escape,"" Uribe told reporters. ""There are signs of corruption around this that are very troubling."" The president questioned why Giraldo was transferred from the capital of Bogota to the outpost to Arauca on the border with Venezuela. The security at Arauca was weak, and somehow Giraldo's rescuers knew where and when to find him, Uribe said. ""We gain nothing from increased security if there is corruption in that security, like this corruption that permitted the escape of this prisoner in Arauca,"" Uribe said. The rebel is believed to have fled to Venezuela, and the president has asked the neighboring country for help finding him, Uribe said. The request comes during a period of tension between Colombia and Venezuela, in part because of Colombian claims that Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has aided the rebel groups. In remarks Thursday, Fabio Valencia Cossio, Colombia's minister of the interior and justice, said that he ordered a new staff to run the Arauca prison. The prison's current director and all 30 guards will be transferred to other posts while an investigation into the escape is underway, he said. Giraldo commanded roughly half the force of the ELN, according to the Colombian government. Formed in the early 1960s, the ELN is the second-largest insurgent force in Colombia, behind the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. The ELN is among several parties to a long-running war that involves leftist rebels, right-wing paramilitary forces, the Colombian government and drug traffickers.","President Alvaro Uribe cites corruption in Colombian rebel's escape .

"Consumers today have more power than ever before. The large and diverse selection of media available on newsstands means that customers know what they should be getting, and if they aren't satisfied with the service there's a host of Web sites and forums on which they can let everyone know. Marriott's TownePlace suite . In response, organizations are seeking ever more innovative ways of understanding their customers' needs, and are even turning to anthropologists and sociologists to help them. ""Whereas before a lot of services were designed from the inside out, now, because consumers are so much more empowered, they are having to think about designing from the outside in,"" says Fran Samalionis, global practice leader for service design and innovation at IDEO. ""They have to think much more about the customer experience and then figure out how to make sense of that for the business."" IDEO, a global design firm, is already well-known for designing the first mouse, for Apple, and the first notebook computer, for GriD, but the company is also causing a stir with its innovative approach to design conception, where the wishes and observations of the consumer hold powerful sway. While it employs what one would call ""conventional"" designers, IDEO also uses what it terms a ""human factor"" team -- people trained in anthropology, sociology and political sciences -- who shadow consumers, observe their everyday habits and relationship with a product, and even give them cameras to record photo journals, in a bid to understand what is really needed for a product to push through the barrier and provide true satisfaction for its customer base. A case in point is Marriott's TownePlace Suites. The hotel chain approached IDEO for ideas about how to launch an extended-stay brand. IDEO followed guests and employees around, monitoring their habits and probing them with questions about every aspect of their experience at Marriott's hotels. Their conversations taught them that extended-stay guests were mainly on the road because of work commitments; they were away from home through necessity rather than choice and therefore wanted an experience from a hotel that was closer to what they were accustomed to at home -- a ""home from home."" IDEO recommended that Marriott install a ""map wall"" in the lobby, with recommendations from fellow guests, such as where to find the best coffee shop or restaurant and where to go jogging in the local area. But they also found that while guests were looking for familiar home comforts, they were also there to work. With that in mind, they drew up prototypes for guest rooms that more closely resemble live/work areas, with an office incorporated into the layout of the bedroom. Market research is not a new concept. Organizations have been bringing their potential customers together for decades to understand what they want from their services. But Samalionis argues that it is by sending its cohorts into the field to observe customers in their natural environments that IDEO gains the real insights and results. She says that while some customers might struggle to articulate their needs -- or even fully comprehend what they are looking for in the first place -- simply by looking at their daily routines IDEO's researchers can gain significant understanding of what can be done to improve customers' relationships with a particular product or service. Such was the case when IDEO worked with Bank of America to develop a new credit card. The card was targeted at young mothers and IDEO's observation team set about following a selection of moms around as they went about their daily business: taking their children to school, shopping, even balancing their checkbooks. They discovered that many people round up their transactions to the nearest whole number for speed and convenience. At the same time, many of the moms were struggling with the discipline of saving, even though they wanted to. The solution IDEO came up with was to introduce a credit card, ""Keep The Change,"" which would instantly transfer the amount customers would usually round up into a separate savings account. Samalionis argues that this is an excellent example of where in-field research ultimately inspired an idea that could be transposed to a real-world scheme. ""Just by being able to be with them, empathize with them and observe them you get to see the stuff they can't tell you,"" she explains. ""We saw all these habits about putting pennies in jars and rounding things up in checkbooks. If you had asked somebody, they would say they just wanted to save money."" All this could be interpreted as just a glossy way of rehashing a construct that has already existed within marketing and design for years -- the market research questionnaire. But Samalionis argues that the human-centered approach is just one cog in their approach to problem-solving; trained designers, engineers, business heads and the client must also have their input. ""It's not enough going out into the world and coming up with a point of view about that world,"" she says. ""You need to make those insights actionable. Really, the magic dust in the process is in synthesizing all those perspectives into something that can help you generate amazing ideas."" Ultimately, the effectiveness of an approach can be best measured by its financial returns. Bank of America's ""Keep The Change"" credit card scheme generated 2.5 million new, and presumably happy, customers. This willingness by designers to open themselves up to public consultation is becoming increasingly popular. In England, Bath's Theatre Royal took opinions into consideration from a panel of local schoolchildren when designing their new children's theatre, The Egg. A panel of nine- to eighteen-year-olds even had a say in the choice of architect and the menu for the cafe. Innovations derived from the consultation include knee-high glass panels on the doors so that smaller theater-goers can see where they are going and a sound-proofed room so that parents with crying babies can sit and watch the show without disturbing the rest of the audience. In Italy, car maker Fiat opened itself up for suggestions from the public during the design of its relaunched Fiat 500. Under the project title ""500 Wants You,"" the hitherto inward-looking manufacturer invited ordinary people to submit ideas for designs on its Web site. IDEO, and other design firms like it, are changing the way large organizations interact with their customers. They are learning about new ways to keep consumers satisfied, and boosting their bank balances in the process. But in the end it's the consumer who is profiting the most from this new approach.","Designers now put the consumer, not function, at the heart of new products .

"London (CNN) -- British-based satellite channel Sky Sports have sacked their top soccer pundit after he made sexist remarks about a female match official while working on a broadcast of an English Premier League game. Andy Gray, a former Scotland and Everton striker, made the comments about assistant referee Sian Massey prior to a match between Wolves and Liverpool on Saturday, not realizing his microphone was being recorded. Gray, 55, said ""women don't understand the offside rule,"" while his colleague, presenter Richard Keys, said the game had ""gone mad."" The pair were suspended by Sky Sports on Monday, but on Tuesday it was confirmed Gray had been axed after new evidence of sexist behavior relating to an incident in December was released by the channel. A statement read: ""Sky Sports today terminated its contract with Andy Gray. The decision, which is effective immediately, was made in response to new evidence of unacceptable and offensive behavior. ""The new evidence, relating to an off-air incident that took place in December 2010, came to light after Andy Gray had already been subjected to disciplinary action for his comments of 22 January 2011."" Barney Francis, managing director of Sky Sports, said: ""Andy Gray's contract has been terminated for unacceptable behavior. After issuing a warning yesterday, we have no hesitation in taking this action after becoming aware of new information today."" Sky Sports reporter Andy Burton, who joked to Gray that Massey was ""a bit of a looker"" prior to the match has also been suspended. Keys subsequently telephoned Massey, who accepted the presenter's apology. During the game, Massey made the correct call when she allowed Liverpool's opening goal in their 3-0 victory to stand, judging a player had been onside. The 25-year-old was due to officiate an English third division match on Tuesday night but was withdrawn by the Professional Games Match Officials. A statement read: ""Sian is an excellent professional who has unwittingly found herself in the middle of a story that has nothing to do with her competence as a match official. ""Sian only wants to be notable for her performance as an assistant referee and is keen for things to get back to normal so she can return to officiating as soon as possible."" Prior to Saturday's game, Massey has been an assistant referee at international matches -- the highest level of the sport -- since 2009, world soccer's governing body FIFA says. England's Football Association (FA) said it was ""proud to have some of the world's best match officials, both male and female."" More than 800 women are qualified to be referees in England, the FA added, saying ""all of our female match officials act as fantastic ambassadors for the game."" Of the major European footballing nations, Germany leads the way for registered female referees with 2,489, according to UEFA. Italy is next with 1,453 and England third with 853. But no female referee has ever taken charge of a top-flight match in the English Premier League, Italy's Serie A, the German Bundesliga or Spain's La Liga, their roles restricted to assistant referee status. Keys also made critical remarks about Karren Brady, the vice-chairman of EPL side West Ham, who had complained about sexism in a Saturday newspaper. ""See charming Karren Brady this morning complaining about sexism? Yeah. ""Do me a favor, love,"" he added.","NEW: Sky Sports soccer pundit Andy Gray has been sacked by the broadcaster .

"(CNN) -- Historians believe they have found a World War II-era mass grave containing the bodies of 220 disabled people killed by Nazis in Austria, they announced this week. The discovery was made by searching files from a mental hospital in the town of Hall, Austria, according to the company that currently runs the institution. The company believes the remains are those of people murdered under a Nazi euthanasia program designed to eliminate ""undesirables."" Tilak, the company running the hospital, says a group of historians led by Oliver Seifert found a map with the outlines of a former cemetery. ""Thanks to the map we know the approximate position of the cemetery and also the number of graves. Right now we believe that 220 people are buried there,"" a Tilak statement quotes Seifert as saying. Tilak says it plans to exhume the victims starting in March. ""Tilak sees it as our moral duty to the relatives of those killed to completely clarify the history of the mental institution's graveyard,"" the press release says. The Nazis annexed Austria in 1938 after their leader, Adolf Hitler, came to power in Germany in 1933. The regime systematically murdered about 6 million Jews, as well as millions of other people including Roma (Gypsies), disabled people, homosexuals, political prisoners and others they considered less than human.","The remains of 220 disabled people are thought to be buried in the Austrian graveyard .

"London (CNN) -- Drug smugglers are using ever more creative methods to hide their stashes, including tucking them inside yams, peanuts and birthday cards, a new list reveals. The list -- released by the UK Border Agency -- rounds up last year's most unusual drug concealments. Details of the smuggling scams are used to raise awareness on drug traffickers' ploys and the penalties that follow. ""These smuggling attempts show the lengths that organized criminals will go to in a bid to get drugs into the UK,"" said Brodie Clark, chief of Border Force. In March, authorities nabbed a suspect with cocaine concealed in packets of peanuts and cashew nuts. The freight at Gatwick Airport had been sent from Jamaica. A 50-year-old man pleaded guilty to drug smuggling and was sent to prison for seven years. In another case, cocaine was found in metal drums containing powdered nuts at Heathrow Airport. It had originated in Mexico and was destined for Melbourne, Australia. In a joint operation with their Australian counterparts, UK police sent a dummy shipment to the address, and police nabbed five men who opened the drums. Famous names were dragged into the scams as well. Drug smugglers tried to conceal cannabis in a painting of former Arsenal player Emmanuel Adebayor. The wooden frame of the soccer star originated from his native Togo and was destined for an address in Tottenham -- close to the team's north London rival by the same name. Investigations are ongoing. In August, authorities seized yams concealed with drugs aboard a freight flight at Kent International Airport in Manston. The food, which had been cut open to stash the drugs and glued back together, originated from Ghana. Other hiding places include drugs scatterered inside air spaces of glass ornaments shaped like love hearts, chickens and miniature bottles. Origin? Peru. Destination? Bristol. The list goes on and on. Officials intercepted a man who had strapped blocks of heroin onto his body; a suspect who had hidden drugs on a birthday card and two others who had swallowed packs of drugs. Authorities said they use various ways to catch smugglers, including sniffer dogs, X-ray machines, intelligence and scans on passengers' baggage. ""Criminals are prepared to invest large sums of money to come up with ever better concealment methods because they know the potential profits from the awful trade in harmful drugs are considerable,"" Clark said. ""However, the smugglers are no match for the skill of our officers and the state-of-the-art technology at their disposal.""","List from UK Border Agency rounds up last year's most unusual drug concealments .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli bulldozers demolished part of a hotel in East Jerusalem on Sunday, prompting swift condemnation from Palestinians. The building plan, which was given final approval last year, was met  with disapproval from the United States at the time which called for the Israeli  government to put off any demolition. Israel demolished part of the hotel as part of a plan to build 20 housing units for Jews in a predominantly Palestinian neighborhood of East Jerusalem. The chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erakat, denounced the action. ""The state of Israel is demolishing one Palestinian property after another in an effort to cleanse Jerusalem of its Palestinian inhabitants, heritage and history,"" he said in a statement. He said such actions ""undermine the two-state solution and negotiations process."" The United States had called on Israel to halt the housing project, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded by saying ""our sovereignty (over Jerusalem) cannot be challenged"".  The project was given final approval last March. The Shepherd Hotel was built in the 1930s by a prominent Palestinian family and was purchased  from the state of Israel  in 1985 by American millionaire Irving Moskowitz , an avid supporter of Jewish building in East Jerusalem.

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich's Luca Toni has returned to Serie A football on a six-month loan with AS Roma, confirmed on Thursday. The 32-year-old Toni is out of favor at the German giants after falling out with coach Louis van Gaal and is desperate for first team football to further his claims for a place in the Italy side at the 2010 World Cup finals. Toni was one of the star's of Italy's winning team in 2006 and moved to Bayern from Fiorentina the following year. The club's official Web site www.fcbayern.de confirmed a move which had been widely predicted. ""In a discussion Luca Toni asked the board of Bayern Munich to loan him out to Roma until the end of the season for personal reasons,"" read a statement.

Toni has not played for his national side since their poor showing in the Confererations Cup in South Africa in June. The Italian club said in a statement that Toni will be with them until June 30, subject to passing a medical test. Toni helped Bayern to a league and cup double in his first full season, but since the arrival of Dutch coach Van Gaal has slipped down the pecking order and played just three Bundesliga games this season. He was fined by the club in November for leaving the stadium at halftime after being substituted in their disappointing 1-1 home draw with title contenders Schalke.

"(CNN) -- Taliban advances in Pakistan are raising concerns in Islamabad and capitals as far away as Washington. CNN's senior international correspondent Nic Robertson looks at how the Taliban spread and what could be done to help Pakistan. Students in burqas in Buner district . How is the Taliban extending its influence in Pakistan? It has extended its influence considerably over the last few years moving northwards along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, from South Waziristan to North Waziristan to Bajur and across now to Swat and Buner. But the Taliban has also extended its influence because it is now involved with several Punjab terrorist groups that have affiliated themselves with the border Taliban and have helped commit some attacks such as one on a police station in Lahore. The Pakistan government has been cutting deals with the different elements that were Taliban or became Taliban since 2004-2005. Those deals have enabled the Taliban to extend themselves. Is Pakistan going to fall or fail? The overall answer to that is no. But the Taliban is further destabilizing an incredibly unstable situation. There is a weak government that faces challenges, not only from the Taliban but also from almost every political party in the country. It faces challenges from across the border with its old enemy India, which means a large percentage of the Pakistan army is tied up on that border rather than fighting terrorism. The Taliban is not going to take Islamabad, but its attacks and advances are going to weaken an already unstable government and make an already dangerous situation even more volatile... and that will mean the Taliban will be able to wield more influence in the future than they do today. What options are open to the Pakistan government and other countries? Pakistan could form a broad-based government of national unity and appeal for more international support in terms of encouraging financial aid and having trade restrictions lifted so they can improve the economy. The international community could help Pakistan resolve issues with India. It would help the economy and help the government focus on its own internal problems and better influence the situation in Afghanistan. What the Pakistan government would also need to do is convince its people that outside support and help is in their best interests to deal with terrorism and stabilize the country. To do that the government would also have to win the support of its large Pashtun minority, from whom the Taliban draws a lot of its support ... and that is difficult particularly as the U.S. -- which would need to be a principle supporter of Pakistan -- continues to bomb targets in Pashtun areas leading to civilian casualties.","Taliban influences in Pakistan has developed over years .

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich's France international midfielder Franck Ribery has suffered another injury setback in his battle to return to first team action. Ribery played a part in just six Bundesliga matches during the first half of the 2009-10 season, lasting the whole 90 minutes only once due to a string of injuries. His knee and toe caused the most frequent problems and it is the latter which has forced him to miss the first session of Bayern's winter training camp in Dubai. Bayern coach Louis van Gaal told the club's official Web site: ""It is practically incredible and very bitter for the coach and the team. ""But we cannot change it. We hope that the medical department works hard and he returns as quickly as possible."" Ribery had joined the rest of his team-mates for a jog around Munich on Sunday before the flight to the United Arab Emirates, but upon arrival in Dubai both of his big toes were swollen. Holes were drilled into the toenails to release an accumulation of blood and relieve the pain in a bid to get the 26-year-old back on his feet as soon as possible. Meanwhile, Bayern are looking to trim their squad, despite four players leaving the Bavarian giants during the winter break. Bayern have offloaded Luca Toni to Roma, Andreas Ottl and Breno to Nuremberg and Alexander Baumjohann to Schalke, but director of sport Christian Nerlinger claims that is just the tip of the iceberg. ""We are going to try to reduce the wagebill futher,"" he told Kicker magazine. ""The wages have gone through the roof and therefore we have got to get our message through to the players that a new contract does not necessarily mean a pay rise."" Toni was Bayern's biggest earner alongside Ribery, whose future is already the focus of intense transfer speculation and who, given the implied cost-cutting measures, now seems even less likely to commit himself to a new contract. Bayern president Uli Hoeness has already revealed the Frenchman will be sold in the summer if he does not extend his contract beyond 2011, although an exception still may be made to Bayern's wage structure to keep hold of the 26-year-old. ""Every case has to be dealt with individually and according to the market,"" added Nerlinger. However, after spending almost 80 million euros on new players last summer, Nerlinger insists his club has ""reached the limit"" as far as signing new players is concerned.","Bayern Munich's France international midfielder Franck Ribery has suffered another injury setback .

"(CNN) -- Werder Bremen coach Thomas Schaaf, 48, has signed a two-year contract extension tying him to the club until 2012. Bremen have emerged as genuine contenders for the Bundesliga title this season, lying four points off leaders Bayer Leverkusen. Last season, Werder won the German Cup and reached the UEFA Cup final, where they lost to Shakhtar Donetsk. General manager Klaus Allofs told the club's official Web site: ""We are very happy that we can make it known before the turn of the year that we are continuing our work together. ""We have always stressed in the past weeks that this is our most important personnel detail. ""This shows the high regard that Thomas enjoys with us. He has proved over many years that, with his ability to improve teams and players, he is an important part of our success."" Schaaf, who has been coach at Werder since 1999 and led them to the league and cup double in 2004, said: ""Our common goal is to move forward successfully. ""I see Werder continues to have an interesting team to be able to pursue our goals. Therefore, it was not hard to accept the new challenges,"" he added. Bremen have coped well with the loss of Brazilian attacking midfielder Diego, who moved to Juventus this summer, with German youngsters like Mesut Ozil and Aaron Hunt taking on more prominent roles. They went down 2-0 at home to title rivals Schalke last weekend, their first defeat since the opening day of the season.","Werder Bremen coach Thomas Schaaf has signed a two-year contract extension .

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of South Koreas were left in limbo after North Korea shut its borders Monday at the start of joint military exercises between the United States and South Korea. U.S. troops have started joint military exercises with their South Korean counterparts. When Pyongyang took the action, 573 South Koreans were staying at the Kaesong industrial complex, north of the demilitarized zone, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported. Many of the stranded South Koreans work at the complex, which is a joint project between the Koreas. ""The South Korean government is closely monitoring the situation and preparing for all contingencies,"" said Kim Ho-nyun, a South Korean Unification Ministry spokesman. ""We emphasize that currently the first priority is the safety of our citizens."" Eighty South Koreans had applied to cross the border into South Korea on Monday, Kim said, but had not been cleared to do so. ""We are also not certain what will happen to the South Koreans that want to cross tomorrow as well,"" he said. The cross-border developments came as North Korea said it would retaliate if a ""satellite"" launch from its northeastern coast were intercepted, with the communist nation saying interference would ""mean a war."" ""Shooting our satellite for peaceful purposes will precisely mean a war,"" a spokesman for the North Korean army said in a statement carried by the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). U.S. and South Korean officials have said that North Korea appears to be preparing to test-fire its long-range missile, the Taepodong-2, under the guise of launching a satellite into space. The missile is thought to have an intended range of about 6,700 kilometers (4,200 miles), which -- if true -- could give it the capability of striking Alaska or Hawaii. North Korea's bellicose announcement came on the first day of annual joint military drills between South Korea and the United States. ""We have said several times that the U.S.-South Korean military exercises are annual defensive exercises,"" Kim said. ""We again urge North Korea to maintain the agreed stance of mutual respect and to stop its verbal attacks and actions that are raising tensions on the Korean peninsula,"" he said. The North said it has shut its borders to ""any enemies"" and has cut off ""the North-South military communications in order to guarantee the security."" North Korea said the military phone lines with the South, the last remaining communications channel, will remain closed until the 12-day military exercises end on March 20, according to Yonhap. Kim said his government is urging North Korea ""to immediately retract this measure and to allow the smooth flow of personnel and communication."" On Saturday, U.S. envoy Stephen Bosworth said he wants dialogue with North Korea, but he also spoke against North Korea's move to go forward with a launch, saying it would be ""ill-advised.""","573 people staying at Kaesong industrial complex, north of demilitarized zone .

"(CNN) -- An embattled Nevada councilwoman e-mailed a friend about items intended for her mother and called police shortly before they found her and her husband dead in an apparent murder-suicide, police in Mesquite said Wednesday. ""Detectives were advised that Bill Fairchild was the victim of a homicide-suicide. The crime scene and autopsy were consistent that Bill was deceased approximately an hour before Donna,"" said Chief Douglas L. Law in a statement after the autopsy. Each of the Fairchilds suffered a single gunshot wound. The bodies were found Tuesday morning, hours before Donna Fairchild was to attend a City Council meeting and face possible sanctions over a travel expense voucher and public comments. A neighbor told CNN on Wednesday she had lunch with Donna Fairchild on Monday and was the recipient of a box left by the councilwoman, apparently on the morning of the shootings. According to police, Donna Fairchild contacted City Attorney Cheryl Truman Hunt around 8:30 p.m. Monday to discuss an opportunity to meet with the mayor and council in order to tender her resignation before the meeting. The city attorney at 10 p.m. confirmed with Fairchild a Tuesday afternoon meeting with the mayor and council. At a news conference, police in this city along Interstate 15 near the Arizona border provided a timeline of the events that led to the shooting deaths. Sometime late Monday or early Tuesday, Donna Fairchild dropped off a box at the friend's house, Law said. ""At 4:20 a.m., an email was sent by Donna to a friend to say she left a note with a box on her friend's porch to be sent to Donna's mother,"" the statement said. ""At 4:33 a.m., Police Dispatch received a 911 call from Donna Fairchild which gave her address, said her door was unlocked and that she would be 'post-suicide.' "" ""At 4:35 a.m., officers and detectives arrived on scene and located Donna and Bill Fairchild in the back bedroom and found each with a single gunshot wound. Both were deceased."" Toxicology tests conducted by the Clark County Coroner's Office were expected to take four to six weeks, according to the city. The city released the audio of the 911 call, in which Donna Fairchild gave the address, said the couple was in the bedroom, the front door was unlocked and ""I am post-suicide."" The police dispatcher said, ""And what's going on there?"" There was no audible response. Melanie Giarratana said she had known the Fairchilds for about 10 years and enjoyed a lunch Monday with Donna Fairchild. ""It was wonderful,"" said Giarratana, who has been active in local issues and economic development in this resort town that features golf resorts and casinos. Donna Fairchild had told her she had made a mistake by filing a $94.60 mileage expense form for a trip city officials said she did not make, Giarratana said. But the councilwoman said she never signed for the check. Giarratana said she had no inkling of what was to occur the next morning. Donna Fairchild forwarded her an e-mail joke around 8 p.m. Monday. The councilwoman sent her another e-mail around 4:20 a.m. Tuesday about the box, but Giarratana did not see the e-mail until 7 a.m., when she found the package outside her home. According to Giarratana, Donna Fairchild wrote her, ""I have left a box full of items for my Mom by your front door. Please make sure she gets it! I know this will never make sense. I am sorry. Thank you for being my BFF."" Bound in rubber bands, the box contained jewelry, cash and a note expressing apologies, Giarratana said. Mesquite city spokesman Bryan Dangerfield said Tuesday that a note and a 9mm handgun were found at the scene. ""The content of the note will not be disclosed until the investigation is complete,"" Dangerfield said. City Manager Timothy Hacker said he believed that Donna Fairchild was concerned about the agenda items, according to CNN Las Vegas affiliate KLAS. Fairchild, who was a candidate for mayor, told the Desert Valley Times last week that she would not comment on the allegations against her but instead would talk about them Tuesday evening. Mayor Susan Holecheck and the city had planned to ask the City Council to consider sanctioning Fairchild through possible reprimand, removal from boards or expulsion for filing the $94.60 mileage reimbursement request with the city for a January 4 Nevada Development Authority board meeting she allegedly did not attend, according to an item on the council agenda. Fairchild allegedly violated the city's code of conduct and its personnel policy, and she allegedly presented a fraudulent claim to a public officer, Hunt wrote in a January 18 memo. Holecheck, who is seeking re-election, and Hunt also wanted the City Council to consider removing Fairchild as the city's representative to the Nevada Development Authority board of directors. According to a filing on the agenda, comments Fairchild made about the authority in a newspaper article ""were negative towards this agency, and deemed incompatible with the mission of the agency and good working relations with other NDA board members."" A January 7 article of the Desert Valley Times includes interviews and comments from Mesquite mayoral candidates. In the article, Fairchild said, ""We just got a bill from the Nevada Development Authority: It costs $7,500 to belong. There was one thing that came out of the NDA, and that was Do It Best. That was huge for the community, but I don't think we're getting the bang for our buck."" In the article, Fairchild said that Mesquite should be doing most of its own marketing. NDA Executive Director Somer Hollingsworth wrote Holecheck that Fairchild -- who was the city's representative to the board since July 2009 -- should have brought her concerns to him, rather than airing them publicly, especially since she was a member of the NDA executive committee, according to an e-mail attached with the filing. According to the agenda item, Fairchild could have discussed her issues with the NDA if she had attended the January 4 board meeting. Donna Fairchild served on the City Council from 2001 to 2007 and was re-elected in 2009. She moved to Mesquite with Bill Fairchild in 1999 after they both retired from the Denver Police Department, the city said. In Mesquite, Bill Fairchild worked at a recreation center and was a member of the Virgin Valley Honor Guard and the Veterans of Foreign War. The Fairchilds were married for 21 years, the city said. ""They had an excellent marriage,"" Giarratana said. The friend of the couple said she does not believe the issues with the city were enough to push Donna Fairchild over the edge. ""I cannot figure out what happened between 8 p.m. and 4:20 a.m.,"" Giarratana said. She said Donna Fairchild wanted to continue her mayoral campaign and deal with the issues, but Giarratana was unaware that the councilwoman had apparently planned to resign Tuesday. ""The town is in total shock,"" Giarratana said. ""The town is weeping."" CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report.","Friend recounts ""wonderful"" lunch with councilwoman day before .

"KANDAHAR, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The soldiers had barely arrived in Iraq before they got new orders -- get ready for Afghanistan. A soldier waits in Baghdad for a flight to his new mission in Kandahar. The 4th Engineer Battalion out of Colorado Springs, Colorado, deployed to Camp Victory near Baghdad in mid-February. Two weeks after the unit began actually going out on operations in Iraq, it was ordered to redeploy to Kandahar in Afghanistan. The soldiers hadn't even finished painting their emblem outside their tactical operations command when the move began. But even as he walked through the stripped-down post, battalion commander Lt. Col. Kevin Landers could not hold back his excitement. ""The president has asked our military and our country to shift the focus and bolster the effort in Afghanistan, and we are really spearheading some of that effort, so of course there is some excitement here,"" he said outside a building being cleared out. The move put a strain on this battalion, which specializes in route clearance, or finding and destroying land mines and bombs on roads to make them safe for travel.  Watch soldiers leave Iraq, arrive in Afghanistan » . ""Yes, it is hard work,"" said Pfc. Kimble Han, sweat pouring down his face as he pulled out a sandbag foundation for a tent he and colleagues had put out only weeks before. ""But I believe we have trained well and are prepared for the new mission in Afghanistan."" The battlefield in Afghanistan is very different than Iraq. ""In Iraq you are looking at more close-quarters combat in an urban environment, but in Afghanistan the area is only sparsely populated and we are looking at much more of a linear battlefield,"" said Lt. Matthew Fitzgibbon. That means the soldiers will probably be engaged in longer distance firefights while on their patrols and their training in Baghdad before the deployment mirrored that. The troops spent extra hours on the shooting range, recalibrating their weapons and testing different optics. ""No matter who the enemy is, we will bring a bigger fight,"" one soldier said loading his weapon. As the United States shifts its focus from Iraq to Afghanistan, the military has deemed route clearance so important to the operations in the Kandahar area that it is airlifting the entire battalion to the new battlefield. The move poses huge logistical challenges to the Army and especially the Air Force. Between 50 and 70 gigantic C-17 cargo planes are necessary to transport dozens of heavy armored mine-resistant vehicles, containers and pallets -- all this as the Air Force's capabilities are strained due to regular combat operations. Many flights are delayed, canceled, rescheduled and then canceled again. Lt. William Hutaff, one of the first soldiers to leave for Afghanistan as part of an advance party, had his flight delayed several times and waited almost two days before he could board one of the cargo planes. ""Yeah, there's been a lot of waiting,"" he said from a seat in the hull of the plane, facing his mine-resistant vehicle that was shipping out too. ""We are glad we are finally going and we hope someone will be there to pick us up."" None of the soldiers with whom CNN traveled to Afghanistan knew what to expect when they hit the ground in Kandahar. The bases in Iraq have been developed over the past six years since the United States led the invasion and offer amenities from shopping facilities to coffee shops. In Iraq, the soldiers stayed in solid trailers. In Afghanistan, they would be living in tents. But none of that seemed on the soldiers' minds as the plane took off from Baghdad International Airport for the four-hour flight to Afghanistan, and many of them went to sleep shortly after takeoff or listened to music on their iPods in the dark and loud hull of the giant plane. The terrain the jet was flying over changed from the Iraqi desert to the more rugged hills of southern Afghanistan before the crew of the C-17 crew performed a combat landing into Kandahar International Airport. Leaving the aircraft, the soldiers said they were tired and looking to get into their new housing units. ""We want to get our vehicle unloaded and then get settled in,"" Hutaff said. Getting settled in meant sleeping in cots in a tent designed to house more than 100 people, but the base itself proved more developed than many had thought, with a basketball court and even an hockey rink built by the Canadian contingent stationed there. But the compound assigned to the battalion proved to be a lot worse for wear than the troops expected. Years ago it had been home to Polish troops, but now the buildings were withering away in the sun. The engineers spent their first days tearing down some structures with bulldozers and ripping the interiors out of others. ""There is still a lot of work to be done here,"" said Fitzgibbon. ""right now our motor pool, the place we're supposed to park our vehicles, is a lake.""","Troops hadn't even finished painting their emblem when they got orders to move .

"(CNN) -- Russian President Dmitry Medvedev visits the Palestinian territories on a ""historic"" trip Tuesday as part of his Middle East tour. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas welcomes him in Jericho in the West Bank, where the two are expected to hold a joint press conference. Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat called Medvedev's trip a ""historic state visit"" adding that ""the message to the world is that the Palestinians are ready for statehood and independence."" The Palestinian and Russian presidents will sign three agreements in agriculture, sports and communications. Medvedev will then inaugurate a new Russian art museum in Jericho. ""It's a beautiful addition"" to the city, Erakat told CNN. Erakat sees this visit as an important step towards achieving Palestinian independence, he said. ""This is our message to the world: Look at us. We are ready for a statehood, we are ready for independence, we are ready for freedom."" Russia was one of the first countries to recognise the Palestinian state and the Palestinians have full diplomatic representation in Moscow. Medvedev cancelled an official visit to Israel this month due to a strike by the Foreign Ministry employees who refused to organize the visit and threatened to disrupt the visit if it took place. Foreign Ministry workers have been striking since mid-December, demanding higher wages. Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor told CNN last week that the strike is harming Israeli interests, just as teachers' strikes and hospital strikes do harm, but he blamed the finance ministry for ignoring the workers' demands. ""They are not taking the strike seriously -- they are treating it as a playground strike,"" he said. Israeli President Shimon Peres phoned the Russian president, apologized for the canceled visit, and thanked him for his involvement in the Middle East peace process. Medvedev accepted to Peres' invitation to meet him at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Israel said.","The Russian president will open an art museum and sign agreements with the Palestinians .

"(CNN) -- David Villa scores a dramatic injury time winner to give Spain a 2-1 victory over Sweden in Innsbruck to put them in the quarterfinals of Euro 2008 by finishing top of Group D. David Villa leads the race for the Golden Boot after his fourth tournament goal saw Spain defeat Sweden 2-1. The match had looked set to end in a draw after Zlatan Ibrahimovic had equalized following Fernando Torres' 15th-minute goal. However, a long ball out of defense dropped kindly for Villa and the striker slipped the ball to the left of goalkeeper Andreas Isaksson for his fourth goal of the tournament. The result leaves Spain with six points in Group D, three more than Sweden and Russia and certain of top spot after beating both those teams. Torres had put Spain in front when he lunged at a pass from David Silva, with his right foot outstretched, to touch the ball past Isaksson. Sweden veteran Henrik Larsson had shot over the bar and Johan Elmander, who scored against Spain in a qualifying match for Euro 2008, missed two chances before Fredrik Stoor curled a pass from the right to Ibrahimovic in the area in the 34th minute. The Inter Milan striker turned away from marker Sergio Ramos and hit a low shot that just made it under goalkeeper Iker Casillas. Spain controlled early on and it was no surprise when Torres put them ahead with his first goal of the tournament. Silva chipped a diagonal pass into the area toward Joan Capdevila, but Torres stuck out his right foot to intercept and touch it in for his 16th goal in 51 appearances for Spain. Larsson and Johan Elmander both had their chances before Stoor found Ibrahimovic at the far post. Ibrahimovic initially tried to volley Stoor's cross from the right and regained control before shrugging Ramos to the ground. He then swerved to score with a low right-footed shot that Casillas got a hand to but could not keep out. It was the second straight match in which Ibrahimovic had scored, after he ended a near three-year scoring drought in a 2-0 victory against Greece. Villa was in the team despite sustaining a hairline fracture of his right index finger while celebrating the first of his hat-trick goals against Russia, and the Sweden defense kept him under wraps until the 38th minute, when Isaksson had to stop a low shot. Elmander, who started in place of the injured Christian Wilhelmsson, was troubling Spain down the flank but was lucky not to concede a penalty for a nudge on David Silva just before halftime. Markus Rosenberg came on for Ibrahimovic to start the second half, with Sweden not wanting to risk their star player's swollen left knee. There were few clear chances in the second half, and those that came went to Spain. Sweden's attack sorely lacked the physical presence of Ibrahimovic, and Larsson just failed to meet Petter Hansson's cross at the far post in the 79th minute for his team's best opportunity. At the other end, Villa jumped on Silva's rebound in the 63rd minute and fired straight at Isaksson from close range. Villa then recovered the loose ball and centered to find Torres, whose shot was blocked. The teams seemed content with a draw that would have helped both, but Sweden was caught out when Capdevila sent a 40-meter pass over the head of Torres and into the path of Sweden defender Hansson. However, Hansson lost the ball under pressure from Villa, who calmly scored with an angled shot from just inside the area. ""We're happy. We had many chances in both halves and we managed to score right at the end,"" said Spain coach Luis Aragones. ""In the second half, we went out looking for the goal and things finally worked out.""","David Villa scores an injury time goal to give Spain a 2-1 victory over Sweden .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- United Nations-backed nuclear inspectors on Sunday visited a newly disclosed Iranian nuclear facility near the city of Qom, Iranian media has reported. ""IAEA inspectors today visited the... nuclear installation,"" the semi-official Mehr news agency said, referring to International Atomic Energy Agency staff. ""The IAEA inspectors arrived Saturday night and are scheduled to inspect the... site several times. The inspectors will leave Tehran Tuesday."" Tehran sent shock waves through the international community in September by revealing the existence of the previously secret nuclear enrichment facility near Qom. The IAEA announced Saturday its inspectors were leaving for the much-anticipated inspection. The agency declined to give more details on Sunday. ""It is our policy not to comment on the itinerary of our inspectors,"" a spokesman for the U.N. nuclear watchdog told CNN. The inspectors will visit the installation to make sure it is being used for peaceful purposes, said Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, according to the Islamic Republic News Agency. The inspection comes after Iran said Friday that it needs more time to decide whether to sign onto a deal that could help end the international showdown over its nuclear activities. That proposal calls for low-enriched uranium produced in Iran to be sent abroad for further enrichment and then returned for use in medical research and treatment. Tehran is studying the draft proposal and will have an answer next week, Iranian diplomat Ali Asghar Soltanieh said on state-run Press TV. Iran informed IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei that it is ""considering the proposal in depth and in a favorable light, but it needs until the middle of next week to provide a response,"" according to an IAEA statement. Delegations from Iran, France, Russia, the United States and the IAEA met in Vienna this week to work out details of the tentative deal reached in early October. France, Russia and the United States have indicated their approval of the arrangement. ""The Director General hopes that Iran's response will equally be positive, since approval of this agreement will signal a new era of cooperation,"" the IAEA statement said. After the current inspection, but before the end of the month, Iranian officials are expected to meet with the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States -- plus Germany to further discuss Tehran's nuclear program. Iran's leaders maintain that their nation's nuclear program is intended solely for peaceful purposes, but many in the West believe Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons capabilities. Low-enriched nuclear fuel can be further enriched into weapons-grade material.

"(CNN) -- Croatia held off a furious late onslaught from Euro 2008 co-hosts Austria to win 1-0 in their opening Group B match in Vienna on Sunday. Emmanuel Pogagtetz, left, fouls Croatia striker Ivica Olic to concede the match-winning penalty. The Croatians took the lead in the fourth minute when midfielder Luka Modric coolly slotted home from the penalty spot after Emmanuel Pogatetz clumsily body-checked striker Ivica Olic in the area. Slaven Bilic's team dominated the first half, and should have gone further ahead in the 35th minute but Olic's strike partner Mladen Petric blazed over the bar with a left-foot volley after beating the offside trap to run on to Vedran Corluka's cross. Austria's main threat had come from set-pieces, but they were not able to capitalize on a string of corners. However, the home players kept battling in the second half and squandered a series of chances to level the score in the final 15 minutes. Martin Harnik fired over the bar on 78 as Croatia scrambled to clear the danger, then substitute Ivica Vastic had a powerful header well saved by goalkeeper Stipe Pletikosa, who then kept out another low effort by the veteran midfielder. Pletikosa also had to deny a driven shot from Umit Korkmaz, who also came off the bench, while another substitute in Roman Kienast flicked a header just wide from a free kick in the third minute of time added on. Croatia went into the tournament as one of the outside bets, having qualified top of their group ahead of Russia with a victory away to England which eliminated the British team. However, their chances of success were dealt a massive blow when top scorer Eduardo da Silva was ruled out of the tournament due to a broken leg. None of Croatia's strikers managed to score in the warmup matches, and the Arsenal forward's goal-poaching ability was sorely missed on Sunday. The winning goal came after Modric and Olic combined down the left wing from a throw-in, and Pogatetz clearly impeded the striker well away from the Austria goal. The Middlesbrough defender was booked for protesting the referee's decision, but he could have no complaints with the ruling. Austria are the lowest-ranked of the 16 teams at the tournament in 92nd place, but showed great courage against a 15th-seeded Croatia side stacked with attacking talent. But they joined fellow co-hosts Switzerland in losing their opening match, following the Czech Republic's 1-0 victory on Saturday. Croatia next play Germany on Thursday, when Austria take on Poland. Coach Bilic was delighted to start with a victory, but was not so impressed with his team's performance. ""Some players were overwhelmed by playing at a great tournament but we started off with the best possible way -- with a win,"" Bilic told reporters. ""In the first 35 minutes we played excellently, of course the early lead contributed to that. ""They exerted more pressure in the second half and I'm sure that is not to do with a lack of strength from our players. But we confined ourselves to our penalty area too early. ""The last 15 minutes or so when they play all or nothing, you can do that -- but we started in the 60th minute or so. I didn't think the players were happy when they got back in the dressing room. I turned on the CD player and said they should sing because they won."" Austria coach Josef Hickersberger was left frustrated by his side's failure to take their chances. ""This was the worst possible start you can have in an opening match of a major tournament,"" he said. ""We took some time to recover, during the first 30 minutes we were nervous. ""For the rest of the match we were playing the way we should have been playing. We even dominated in the second half of the match. We had good opportunities but unfortunately we weren't able to score a goal, so we are empty-handed. In our remaining games we need four points to go through.""

"(CNN) -- A Virginia woman whose husband and daughter were gunned down in last week's terror attacks in India says the attackers should be forgiven. Kia Scherr, left, says her daughter, Naomi, and  husband, Alan, were ""having the times of their lives"" in India. ""We must send them our love, forgiveness and compassion,"" Kia Scherr told reporters Tuesday of the Mumbai attackers, nine of whom were killed by Indian forces. ""As Jesus Christ said long ago, they know not what they do. ""They are in ignorance, and they are completely shrouded and clouded by fear, and we must show that love is possible and love overpowers fear. So that's my choice."" Alan Scherr, 58, and Naomi Scherr, 13, were among 25 people who had traveled to India for a meditation retreat with Virginia-based spiritual group Synchronicity Foundation, to which the Scherrs belonged. Authorities said the father and daughter were found fatally shot in a restaurant in Mumbai's Oberoi Hotel, where the group was staying. Kia Scherr, who didn't go on the trip, said at a news conference in Faber, Virginia, she is experiencing the ""deepest grief and pain I have ever known."" Synchronicity's founder, Charles Cannon, told reporters Alan Scherr was in Cannon's room at the Oberoi shortly before the attacks began on the night of November 26. They were discussing the next day's activities for the group. ""He said that he was hungry and he was going down to the restaurant to eat,"" Cannon said. Scherr and his daughter were in the restaurant with other Synchronicity travelers when gunmen burst into the hotel and started shooting, Cannon said. One of the travelers, Andi Veragona, told CNN affiliate WTVF that she was trying to play dead during the attack, and that she was trying to calm Scherr, who was next to her. ""[He] was panicking, and I put my hand on the back of his neck, and just saying, 'Shhh,' "" she told the Nashville, Tennessee, station. ""And then I felt a bullet penetrate his head, and he just went limp, and he was bleeding all over me."" Linda Ragsdale, Veragona's friend and fellow Tennessee resident, told The Washington Post that she pulled Naomi Scherr under a table but couldn't save her. ""I was taking in the enormity of the moment, thinking that this energetic child who I had been playing with in the pool the night before -- and had made a pact to do somersaults with -- was dead, shot,"" Ragsdale told the Post. Ragsdale's husband, Ben, said his wife and others played dead, but a gunman ""decided to shoot into the file of them."" Three of the Synchronicity survivors in the restaurant -- including Ragsdale and Veragona -- were shot, and a bullet grazed a fourth. Ben Ragsdale said hotel staff eventually led the four outside, where they caught the taxis that drove them to a hospital. Cannon told CNN's ""Larry King Live"" on Tuesday that he and two others were in his hotel room when the attacks began. They barricaded the door and remained there for nearly 48 hours, getting information about the whereabouts of other Synchronicity members by cell phone and their room phone, he said. ""Slowly, we were able to account for everyone but [Alan and Naomi Scherr],"" Cannon said. ""And we knew they had been in the restaurant at a table where four of the others who were shot and injured had gotten out."" About two days after the attacks began, Indian commandos escorted Cannon and the two others out of Cannon's room, he told reporters at Tuesday's news conference. He said the hotel looked like ""a bombed-out war zone."" ""Bodies [were] everywhere, glass, everything broken and smoky,"" he said of the hotel, where grenades had exploded and fires had burned. On his way out, police asked him if he could identify any remains, he said. Cannon said he stepped over bodies and walked through pools of blood in the restaurant to get to the table where Alan and Naomi had been sitting. ""I found and identified Alan and Naomi, who were laying under the table, heads facing each other and their arms outstretched to each other and overlapping,"" he said. ""It [was] one of the most challenging things I have ever had to do in my life, to identify the remains of two people who I loved like family."" Three of the wounded Synchronicity travelers still were in an Indian hospital this week, Cannon said on ""Larry King Live."" Ragsdale's son told CNN she had been shot in the back, but that the bullet hit nothing vital. Veragona suffered leg and arm wounds. Kia Scherr told reporters she had spoken to her husband and daughter by phone in the days before the attacks, and that they were ""having the times of their lives."" The trip was the first time Naomi had traveled by plane, and it was Alan's third visit to India this year, she said. ""He told me by phone one day: 'I love these people. I could live here,' "" she told ""Larry King Live."" CNN's Brian Todd contributed to this report.","""We must show that love is possible,"" says mother, wife of Mumbai attack victims .

"(CNN)  -- Cristiano Ronaldo gave Manchester United a New Year boost by again ruling out a move to Spanish giants Real Madrid. Ronaldo's goals fired United's brilliant 2008-09 campaign. The European Footballer of the Year has been constantly linked with a transfer to the Bernabeu, speculation which increased following recent claims that Real had reached an agreement with United over his eventual sale. ""There's always speculation, not just about me, but about the future of players all around the world,"" Ronaldo told the club's official television station MUTV. ""People were speaking about me this summer but that was normal because of what I did during the season. ""What people are saying now is not true. Who says that is a liar because I am happy at the club, I want to stay here. I feel at home here. I feel very happy here."" Ronaldo was widely quoted during a turbulent summer that he was keen to play for Real and it appeared only a matter of time before the move became a reality, but now the 23-year-old is pledging loyalty to the Old Trafford faithful. ""I love the fans because they have been brilliant with me, not just this season but every season. Like I said before, I feel at home in Manchester,"" he added. Ronaldo scored 42 goals in United's Premier League and Champions League double last season and after coming back from ankle surgery has netted 11 times this campaign. United go into 2009 handily-placed to retain the English title, in the knockout stages of the Champions League and semifinals of the League Cup. Ronaldo is crucial to their continued success and he used the interview to pay tribute to the role manager Alex Ferguson has played in his development into a world class player. 'I want to be part of this club with you. I want to win trophies with you.' He's very important in my career, Alex Ferguson,"" he added.","Cristiano Ronaldo dismisses new reports linking him to Real Madrid .

"(CNN) -- Will Michael Jackson stop the world? Fans have set up impromptu shrines to Michael Jackson, including this one at his family's house. Thousands are expected to swamp Los Angeles, California, to mourn him Tuesday at the Staples Center, and the accompanying media crush will be enormous. The tribute to the King of Pop at Harlem's Apollo Theater earlier this week drew coverage from all over the world, along with a public turnout in the thousands. Given the feverish interest in all things Jackson, the Los Angeles memorial could be one of the most-viewed events of all time. ""This will obviously be a huge media event, and with Web streams of the funeral, it may be impossible to say for sure how many people watched once all is said and done, because there's still no comprehensive way to measure Web viewing,"" said Toni Fitzgerald, of Media Life, in an e-mail interview. A handful of events have earned the kind of worldwide coverage to put the world on pause, if only for a moment. The 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy ""had the nation locked in a trance for two or three days,"" recalled TV critic Ed Bark of UncleBarky.com. The world audience for the Apollo 11 moon landing has been estimated in the hundreds of millions. The BBC estimated 2.5 billion people watched the 1997 funeral of Princess Diana.   Watch Jermaine Jackson talk about his brother's legacy » . The numbers are easily exaggerated -- nobody knows how many people are watching in groups or in public places -- and the Web has complicated matters further. But in a multichannel, satellite TV, computer-and-cell phone world, the Jackson memorial could have an audience in the hundreds of millions. It was first believed the event would take place at Jackson's Neverland Ranch. But the family announced Thursday that it will hold a private ceremony Tuesday, and then a massive public memorial service at the Staples Center. Fans had until 6 p.m. Saturday to register for free tickets to the memorial service. Organizers used a computer to choose 8,750 names from 1.6 million who registered since Friday.   Watch a tour of Neverland » . ""You have to go back to the Beatles, the death of John Lennon perhaps, and the death of Elvis Presley to find a comparable figure in, not just pop music, but pop culture,"" said Entertainment Weekly critic-at-large Ken Tucker. (EW, like CNN, is a unit of Time Warner.) ""And Jackson so self-consciously turned himself into not just an American pop icon but a global pop icon. I think this does have worldwide implications and interest.""  See how interest in Jackson's music has skyrocketed » . The circumstances of Jackson's death have led to  comparisons with Presley's in 1977, but in terms of coverage, the two can't compare. The news wasn't even the top story on CBS' ""Evening News,"" Bark recalled, and there certainly wasn't wall-to-wall nationwide live coverage of his funeral. A public viewing drew about 30,000 fans; the funeral, two days after his death, was held in Graceland's living room. But Bark said there are parallels, at least in terms of coverage, with the Kennedy assassination. ""These days it's so much harder to get a bulk audience on any given venue the way the [broadcast networks] did back then, but still the enormity [of the event] -- it's the syndicated tabloid shows ... and TMZ and all the cable networks devoting lots of attention to it, [and] the broadcast networks can't seem to do enough specials in prime time,"" said Bark. ""I do think it's comparative but in a very different way."" Officially, the sorts of events that have attracted the largest mass audiences have been scheduled entertainment or sports programs. Sixty percent of America watched the 1983 ""M*A*S*H"" finale; more than half watched the 1980 ""Who Shot J.R."" episode of ""Dallas"" and the 1977 ""Roots"" conclusion. The Beatles' first appearance on ""The Ed Sullivan Show"" in 1964 drew about 45 percent of the country. The Super Bowl is routinely the year's most watched program, with audiences north of 80 million -- about 40 percent of U.S. television households. Although interest in Jackson has been high, the number of viewing choices (and, perhaps, the traditional decline in summer viewing) has kept the ratings for individual Jackson-oriented shows down. ""Jackson's death came up in just about every conversation I had from Thursday to Sunday, and yet only 5 million people tuned in to some of those broadcast specials,"" Media Life magazine's Fitzgerald observed. Still, the public memorial service might be different. ""I expect you'll see very big tune-ins on the cable news networks and on BET, if they cover it; they had huge numbers for their BET Awards focused on Jackson over the weekend,"" Fitzgerald said. The BET Awards was watched by 10.7 million, the most ever for a cable awards show. ""With the celebrity factor thrown into the funeral, who'll be there, who'll talk, I would guess tens of millions in the U.S. will watch it on TV,"" she said. It is certain is that the news media will be there in force. ""I guess we're all going to wait and see what the spectacle is,"" Bark said. ""There may be no precedent for this.""","Public memorial Tuesday could be one of the most-viewed events of all time .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- Oscar Reynoso owed his bosses $300,000, and he was running out of time. One anti-drug operation in Atlanta netted $10.6 million, 108 kilos of cocaine, 17 pounds of meth and 32 weapons. Gunmen snatched Reynoso and locked him in the basement of a home to try to settle the drug debt. He was chained to a wall of the basement by his hands and ankles, gagged and beaten. His captors, members of a powerful Mexican drug cartel, held Reynoso for ransom, chained in the sweltering, dirty basement for six days without food. Reynoso's ordeal could've been a scene from the drug war in Mexico. But it played out recently in suburban Atlanta, Georgia. U.S. federal agents are fighting to keep that kind of violence from gripping Atlanta, as the city known for Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines has become a major distribution hub for Mexican drug cartels. In fiscal year 2008, authorities confiscated about $70 million in drug-related cash in Atlanta, more than anywhere else in the United States, the Drug Enforcement Administration says. This fiscal year, Atlanta continues to outpace all other U.S. regions in such seizures, with $30 million confiscated so far. Next are Los Angeles, California, with about $19 million, and Chicago, Illinois, with $18 million. ""There is definitely a center of this type of drug activity here, and we are working to make sure the violence does not spill out to the general public,"" Atlanta U.S. Attorney David Nahmias said. Atlanta has become a stopping point for truckloads of Mexican cocaine, heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine, agents say. The drugs are held in stash houses before being distributed up the East Coast. ""The money comes down here also to money managers in Atlanta, who get the books in order before it is sent out,"" said Rodney Benson, Atlanta's chief of the DEA. Agents attribute the growth in drug trafficking to Atlanta's location, proximity to other major cities and access to major highways. Authorities also point to the growth of the Hispanic population in Atlanta, which allows practitioners of the Mexican drug trade to blend in among hard-working, law-abiding Hispanics. No place is that more evident than in Gwinnett County, a community about 20 miles north of Atlanta. Gwinnett's Hispanic population rocketed from 8,470 in 1990 to 63,727 in 2000, according to the U.S. Census. By 2010, 20 percent of the county's projected population of 700,000 is expected to be Hispanic. ""In Gwinnett County, the drug dealers are able to hide in plain sight,"" county District Attorney Danny Porter said. ""To combat this, we have to be much more coordinated between my office, the police department and the federal authorities. The presence of the organizations is a dilemma enough that we have to develop new tactics."" Federal agents say arrests and drug-related violence in Atlanta have been linked to the two most powerful Mexican organizations: the Sinaloa and Gulf cartels. A battle over drug routes has been blamed for the recent surge in violence in Mexican border towns, bloodshed that has included hundreds of deaths. The fear is that the battle will extend deeper into the United States, causing more to suffer a fate similar to Reynoso's ordeal in the Gwinnett County basement. Lucky for Reynoso, federal agents had a wiretap on his captors' phones. Agents stormed the home just as it appeared that the debt would not be paid and Reynoso would be killed. ""There is no doubt in my mind that we saved his life that day,"" said the DEA's Benson. One case resolved, as cartels thrive in Atlanta.","City outpaces all others in the United States in drug-related cash seizures .

"John L. Allen Jr. is the senior correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter and senior Vatican analyst for CNN. Pope Benedict leaves the Church of Nativity in his pope mobile after celebrating Mass Wednesday in Bethlehem. JERUSALEM (CNN) -- The Middle East may be the most hyper-sensitive piece of real estate on earth, where no more than a stray word or gesture can trigger an explosion. For precisely that reason, the Vatican had hoped that Benedict's trip to the region this week could surmount the occasional PR gaffes that have plagued his papacy. He would stay ""on message"" about peace, reconciliation, and inter-faith solidarity. That game plan began to unravel Tuesday. The pope's spokesman issued an unsolicited denial that Benedict XVI had ever been a member of the Hitler Youth, only to have to retract that denial within a couple of hours. In so doing, the Vatican inadvertently reopened a chapter of the pope's past that most people had considered closed. The Rev. Federico Lombardi, an Italian priest who serves as the pope's spokesman, made the statement in a briefing with reporters on Tuesday, after Benedict's hugely symbolic visits to the Dome of the Rock and the Western Wall in Jerusalem. In his prepared remarks, Lombardi complained that media outlets had been reporting a ""falsehood,"" namely the claim that Joseph Ratzinger, the future Benedict XVI, had belonged to the Hitler Youth. ""The pope was never in the Hitler Youth: never, never, never,"" Lombardi said. Journalists who have followed Benedict XVI closely over the years were startled by that assertion, because it's well known that the pope, more than 10 years ago, discussed having been involuntarily enrolled in the Hitler Youth as a young seminarian growing up in Hitler's Germany. In a 1997 book-length interview with a German journalist titled ""Salt of the Earth,"" then-Cardinal Ratzinger said: ""When the compulsory Hitler Youth was introduced in 1941, my brother was obliged to join. I was still too young, but later, as a seminarian, I was registered in the H.Y."" Ratzinger went on to discuss how he never took part in the group and stayed as far away from it as possible. Roughly two hours after his original statement on Tuesday, Lombardi took a huge step backwards. Asked by reporters for clarification, he said he could confirm that Ratzinger was registered in the Hitler Youth and was technically a member. ""This was a formal thing, which was not a significant part of his life,"" Lombardi said. ""He had no active participation and no identification with this movement."" To be sure, the young Ratzinger came out of a strongly anti-Nazi family, and the evidence is clear that he never participated in any Hitler Youth activities, was never a member of the Nazi party, and became part of an auxiliary unit of the Germany army only because he was drafted. He was appalled by Nazism and has a long record of affection for Jews and Judaism. Nonetheless, it's a fact of his biography that Joseph Ratzinger was once registered in the Hitler Youth. All this was widely discussed when he was elected to the papacy four years ago, and when the dust settled, most observers considered it resolved because of the clear evidence that the pope had been anti-Nazi from the start. If anything, the fact that the pope had been compelled to register in the Hitler Youth gave him credibility in addressing the horrors of National Socialism, since he had seen them from within. Yet the Vatican's clumsy attempt to deny something that the pope himself had already conceded long ago reawakened the story, prompting media agencies around the world to rehash the details. Probably the last place on earth the Vatican would want to launch a news cycle dedicated to Benedict and the Hitler Youth would be in Israel, and yet that's exactly how it played out. In the end, the episode is probably no more than a footnote to the broader themes of the pope's historic Middle East visit, but it does illustrate one critical point: When it comes to public relations, the pope and his team are far from infallible. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John L. Allen Jr.","Pope Benedict's spokesman said pope was never in Hitler Youth, then said he was .

"MATABELELAND, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- British broadcaster Sky News Wednesday criticized the jail sentences given to three of its drivers in Zimbabwe, where a court found them guilty of possessing broadcast equipment without authorization. Journalists read a newspaper in Zimbabwe, where freedom of the press is extremely limited. The men are all from Johannesburg, South Africa and were sentenced Tuesday, according to their attorney. ""We deplore the harsh sentence given to the three South African drivers,"" a Sky News spokesman, who did not give his name, said in London. ""We will be appealing and hope that the Zimbabwean justice system fully reappraises its decision."" A court convicted Bernet Hasani Sono, Resemate Boy Chauke, and Simon Maodi on Monday in Matabeleland, the state-run newspaper Chronicle reported. The three men pleaded guilty to violating the Postal and Telecommunications Act but denied the truck and Sky News equipment were theirs, the state paper reported. The judge, John Masimba, said that despite denying ownership, possession of the equipment was still a violation of the act. Masimba said in the Chronicle that it would send the wrong signal if he did not punish the men. Sono and Maodi were additionally charged an extra six weeks in jail for violating a section of the Immigration Act after the two didn't show up to the Immigration authorities, their defense lawyer, Tawengwa Hara, said. The charge was minor but Hara said he would appeal the possession charge and the sentence. Zimbabwean police stopped the men during a routine check at a Mbalabala roadblock in the Matabeleland South province and found boxes containing the communication equipment. The men were unable to give a reason for possessing it and were arrested, Hara said. The police claimed the three defendants were journalists, but the men denied the claim. ""We are really outraged at six months in prison for just driving a car,"" said Leonard Vincent, director of the Africa desk at Paris-based Reporters Without Borders (RSF). The men's lawyer might be able to file an appeal or the South African government could try to intervene in the case, Vincent said, but it was unlikely the men could be freed before serving their full sentences. ""They are innocent victims of a very tense political situation,"" Vincent said. There have been numerous media reports from Zimbabwe made without the government's authorization, prompting the arrests of several journalists. Press freedom groups say Zimbabwe has some of the world's most restrictive laws for journalist accreditation. ""They face two years in prison if caught working without this precious document,"" RSF said in its 2008 annual report on the country, a reference to the accreditation. ""No foreign reporter can legally work in Zimbabwe without fear of arrest, being paraded like a trophy, and expelled after high-speed sentencing."" Since the 2002 elections, the local and foreign media has deteriorated, said Tom Rhodes, the Africa program coordinator of the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists. Zimbabwe ""once had the highest literary rate in sub-Saharan Africa and a vibrant media system,"" Rhodes said, but since the elections, draconian press laws had increasingly limited the access to information. The accreditation law's Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act blocked some foreign media and shut down several independent newspapers during the 2002 elections. This sparked more restrictions, which now requires journalists to have two forms of government approval, one from the Media Information Commission and the other from the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission. President Robert Mugabe amended the laws in January but authorities still use them to suppress critical press coverage, Rhodes said. In April, however, New York Times journalist Barry Bearak and British freelancer Stephen Bevan were arrested on charges of violating the laws but were later released. And toward the end of May, distributors of the Zimbabwean Sunday paper were beaten by unknown assailants and the truck carrying the papers was burned. CNN's Melissa Gray contributed to this report.","Three Sky News drivers found guilty of possession of TV equipment .

"(CNN) -- Furious winds, giant waves and lack of sleep have all plagued the journey of Dilip Donde, the first Indian to attempt sailing solo round-the-world. But, Donde remains unruffled: The Indian navy commander hand picked by the Navy for the voyage told CNN he had anticipated the violent weather in the rough far southern waters that skim the Antarctic coast. ""Sailing through the Southern Ocean, it was bound to happen some time so I was expecting it, though that does not make it any more comfortable,"" he said. Donde set off in August 2009 and is hoping to reach Mumbai by mid-May. Donde has blogged throughout his voyage, giving regular updates as well as breaking down various sailing jargon for the uninitiated, like the famous Beaufort Scale. The scale, is the international standard for determining wind speeds based on observable sea conditions, such as the height of waves. The scale goes from zero (no wind, glassy sea) to 12 (hurricane winds of over 100 kilometers per hour and ""phenomenal"" seas with waves that can sometimes reach above 17 meters). And in the open ocean, often days away from help, these conditions also have a palpable psychological effect on a sailor's state of mind, according to Donde. Sailors seek out the exhilaration that comes from sailing in strong winds -- just under 40 km/h is ideal -- but it's a fine line, and as winds get stronger, delight can be tinged with anxiety which can quickly turn into terror. While on a brief stop in South Africa, 42-year-old Donde spoke to CNN about his own state of mind while at sea and how rough weather can affect it. CNN: What has your most extreme day on the boat like? I was sailing through winds gusting to 55 knots (101 km/h) and waves of up to nine meters high in the ""furious fifties"" through the Tasman sea between Australia and New Zealand. Rounding Cape Horn was bad too with steep breaking waves, strong currents and winds gusting to 45 knots (83 km/h) in the ""roaring forties."" And, yes, it was bitterly cold in those latitudes. Do you ever worry that you could be seriously injured? The biggest worry when the sea is violent, is always falling off the boat. When the sea is dangerous, visibility is low and you get thrashed around. The boat is on auto-pilot so if you fall it continues alone. I wear a harness. When you are going through bad weather all your attention is focused on keeping the boat in one piece ... so there is not much time to start thinking about death. If the boat is alive, you're alive. That probably helps in keeping your mind focused and [away from] worrying unnecessarily about other things that may or may not happen. How scary does the weather get? When you are in the middle of nowhere there is little choice: One has but to keep going if the weather turns nasty, so you just grin and bear it, keep the boat safe and tell yourself that ""this too shall pass."" But I have probably experienced all the states of mind except for ""I want my mummy!"" (see factbox) although it has come pretty close. Do sailors secretly hope for giant waves and storms, because it makes the experience more exciting? I don't think so. While you do hope for good winds, you always hope that the sail will be as uneventful as possible. Any sailor will try his best to avoid a storm. Why do sailors constantly push themselves in to extreme situations? Probably there is an element of thrill; of understanding oneself and the elements better. With long-distance sailing, like everything else in life, you get a package deal of good days and bad days. It is wonderful to sail on a good sunny day with a clear sky and moderate breeze, and one has to be ready to suffer the bad weather as and when it comes. The good days more than make up for the bad ones.","Dilip Donde is the first Indian sailor ever to attempt a round-world solo voyage .

"Editor's Note: David M. Walker served as comptroller general of the United States and head of the Government Accountability Office (GAO) from 1998 to 2008. He is now president and CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation. David Walker says the $700 billion bailout is a pittance compared with the debt facing the United States. (CNN) -- The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act contains plenty to make lawmakers on the left and right shudder. On the right, it's the apparent abandonment of free-market principles. On the left, it's the absence of punishment for high-flying Wall Street CEO's. Looking down the middle, what I found downright unnerving was how hard Washington struggled to pass a bill that, in reality, represents less than 1 percent of our current federal financial hole. Don't get me wrong. Congress and the Bush Administration are to be commended for acting to relieve the credit crunch and trying to minimize any immediate, adverse effect on our economy and by consequence, on American jobs and access to credit. The ultimate cost of the act should ring up at less than $500 billion, less than the advertised $700 billion because of anticipated proceeds from the government's sale of the assets it will acquire with the appropriated funds. The nation's real tab, on the other hand, amounted to $53 trillion as of the end of the last fiscal year. That was the sum of our public debt; accrued civilian and military retirement benefits; unfunded, promised Social Security and Medicare benefits; and other financial obligations -- all according to the government's most recent financial statement of September 30, 2007. The rescue package and other bailout efforts for Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, AIG and the auto industry, escalating operating deficits, compounding interest and other factors are likely to boost the tab to $56 trillion or more by the end of this calendar year. With numbers and trends like this, you might ask, ""Who will bail out America?"" The answer is, no one but us! Since we're going to have to save ourselves, recent events could hardly be called encouraging. It took an additional $100 billion in incentives -- some would call them ""sweeteners;"" others might call them bribes -- to get lawmakers to pass the rescue package. Regardless of what you call these incentives, ultimately the taxpayers will have to pick up the tab, with interest. The process that was employed to achieve enactment of this bill was hardly a model of efficiency or effectiveness. The original proposal represented an over-reach and under-communication by the administration. Neither lawmakers nor ordinary citizens had enough information to properly assess the real risks, the need for action and what an appropriate course of action might be. Furthermore, the key players allowed the legislation to be characterized as a $700 billion bailout of Wall Street, which was neither an accurate nor a fair reflection of the legislation. Passage of the credit-crunch relief provisions in the act was understandable, not just because of what risks and needed actions the Treasury and the Federal Reserve were aware of, but more importantly, because of what policymakers didn't know and eventually might have to address. Let's face it -- the regular order in Washington is broken. We must move beyond crisis management approaches and start to address some of the key fiscal and other challenges facing this country if we want our future to be better than our past. A good place to start would be for the presidential candidates to acknowledge our $53 trillion (and growing) federal financial hole and commit to begin to address it. Their endorsement of the need for a bipartisan fiscal future commission along the lines of the one sponsored by  Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tennessee, and Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Virginia, also would make sense. Any such commission should, at a minimum, address the need for statutory budget controls, comprehensive Social Security reform, a first round of tax reform and a first round of comprehensive health care reform. It should hold hearings both inside and beyond the Beltway. And, its recommendations should be guaranteed to receive an up-or-down vote by Congress if a super-majority of the commission's members can agree on a comprehensive proposal. Our fiscal time bomb is ticking, and the time for action is now! The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer.","David Walker: The U.S. faces a debt much larger than the bailout amount .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A meningitis outbreak is threatening the lives of tens of thousands of people in Darfur, according to an aid agency expelled from the country last week. A Doctors without Borders medic helps a sick child in a Darfur refugee camp. Humanitarian organization Doctors Without Borders, also known as Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), says it was preparing to vaccinate around 100,000 people in southern and western Darfur against meningitis, when it was told to leave the country. ""We were in the process of organizing a vaccination campaign. At the moment  there's no one there that can take over those activities, which is really worrying,"" Gemma Davies of MSF told CNN. The country's Ministry of Health officially declared a meningitis outbreak on March 2 at the Kalma Camp, which shelters more than 90,000 refugees in southern Darfur. ""Living in such close proximity, the potential for this outbreak to spread quickly is quite high, Davies, MSF project coordinator for South Darfur, told CNN. ""With no health care providers to give vaccinations, and with no one to manage the meningitis cases when they come, it's really concerning,"" she added. The vaccination campaign was due to begin on March 7, but it is now unclear if or when it will resume, as reports of government harassment of aid workers continue. Davies told CNN she experienced no harassment, and said government officials had  been in contact with only the head of MSF's regional operations. ""We haven't actually been given any reason on why we were expelled,"" she said. ""We have absolutely no idea when we'll be able to return."" Doctors Without Borders was among 13 aid agencies, including Mercy Corps and the International Rescue Committee, that were ordered by the government to shut down their operations in Sudan last week. So far the agency has confirmed 32 meningitis cases and four deaths, and has seen dozens of other suspected cases. Thousands of unvaccinated refugees and villagers are now exposed to the airborne disease in densely populated camps and villages throughout Sudan. ""One of our priorities is to get another organization to take over our programs there,"" Davies added. The medical relief agency says it doubts though that other any other organizations have the capacity to deal with a meningitis epidemic. Davies also said she is worried about the cut-off of MSF's feeding and maternal delivery services: ""We had over 100 patients on our feeding program that now won't be receiving any follow up."" The decision by the Sudanese government to throw out the aid groups came a day after the International Criminal Court at The Hague issued an arrest warrant for Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur. However, not all international aid organizations are affected. Others including World Vision international continues its work, which reaches approximately 500,000 internally displaced people in South Sudan. The U.N. has received reports that international staff members of five non-governmental organizations had been detained for up to four hours. Speaking on the phone from Nairobi, an aid worker, who asked not to be identified for fear of further harassment, told CNN that his colleagues who remained in Khartoum were being intimidated and threatened by government agents. In some cases Sudanese government representatives ""had started gathering banking details and confiscating computers, communications equipment and vehicles from the NGOs"", a U.N spokesman said at a news conference last week. Last week, the U.N. warned that the loss of  NGOs in Sudan would cause 1.1 million people to go without food aid and health care, and more than 1 million to have no access to water. Oxfam, whose work focuses on providing safe drinking water, was one of the aid groups who were told their registration to operate in Sudan was no longer valid. Ninety percent of their staff are Sudanese nationals, who mostly remain in country, unable to continue their relief work under threat of arrest. ""These agencies are vital implementation partners for the United Nations and account for at least half of the humanitarian capacity in Darfur,"" said Catherine Bragg, U.N. Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator at the news conference in New York.","Meningitis threatens hundreds of thousands of people in Darfur .

"(CNN) -- A United Nations representative has condemned sexual violence in the Ivory Coast as the White House met with leaders urging the nation's incumbent leader Laurent Gbagbo to give up power. ""Following reports of rapes in Cote d'Ivoire, I condemn in the strongest possible terms the employment of sexual violence as a means to political ends,"" said Margot Wallstrom, a special U.N. representative on sexual violence in conflict. ""From preliminary information, it seems that the assaults follow carefully selected political targeting,"" she said in a statement Wednesday. The United Nations and the international community have pressured Gbagbo to leave office, saying that Alassane Ouattara fairly won a contentious November election. On Wednesday, the White House hosted leaders from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to discuss the crisis in the country. The West African delegation met with Tom Donilon, the national security adviser. ""Mr. Donilon expressed strong support for the efforts of ECOWAS to facilitate a peaceful transition of power in Cote D'Ivoire,"" the White House said in a statement. ""Mr. Donilon and the ECOWAS delegation reaffirmed their shared commitment to see that the winner of the recent elections, Alassane Ouattara, takes his rightful role as President of Cote d'Ivoire, and their shared resolve to see former President Laurent Gbagbo cede power,"" the statement said. Cote d'Ivoire is the French name for Ivory Coast, a former French colony. Human Rights Watch has accused Gbagbo of carrying out a ""reign of terror"" against his people. ""Security forces under the control of Laurent Gbagbo and militias that support him have, since late November 2010, committed extrajudicial killings, forced disappearances, torture and rape,"" the organization said in a news release. ""An in-depth investigation into violations in the commercial capital, Abidjan, revealed an often-organized campaign of violence targeting members of opposition political parties, ethnic groups from northern Cote d'Ivoire, Muslims and immigrants from neighboring West African countries,"" Human Rights Watch said. Wallstrom urged investigations of sexual violence allegations and for perpetrators to be brought to justice. ""The security situation for women and girls unfortunately has deteriorated in the western parts of the country,"" since last year, she said. ""I call for urgent steps to be taken to avert the risk of increased sexual violence and to ensure the protection of civilians, especially women and girls,"" Wallstrom said.

"(CNN) -- Romanian striker Adrian Mutu saw his late penalty saved by Gianluigi Buffon as world champions Italy scraped a 1-1 draw in Zurich to keep their Euro 2008 hopes hanging by a thread. Romanian players celebrate Adrian Mutu's opening goal in the thrilling 1-1 draw against Italy. Mutu had earlier given Romania the lead only for Christian Panucci to level a minute later. The result leaves Italy needing to beat France in their final match to qualify, while Romania also have a chance to progress if they defeat Netherlands in their final match. Italy coach Roberto Donadoni made five changes to his starting line-up, following the dismal opening 3-0 defeat by Netherlands, with World Cup winners Marco Materazzi and Gennaro Gattuso among those left out. Those changes looked to be working as the Azzurri started brightly, almost breaking the deadlock in the eighth minute when Alessandro Del Piero's close-range header from Simone Perrotta's cross went just wide of the near post. In the 15th minute, Romania should have gone in front but Mutu's left-footed strike from the edge of the area was parried away by Buffon. At the other end, Luci Toni latched onto Fabio Grosso's cross but his header went high over the bar. Buffon was then forced to fully stretch to clear Gabriel Tamas' free-kick towards the far post. Italy almost fell behind in the 19th minute when Cristian Chivu's free-kick rebounded off the far post after being deflected by Panucci, with Buffon already beaten. But the Italians were looking more dangerous. Both Del Piero and Toni headed wide from good positions, while Romania goalkeeper Bogdan Lobont made a fine one-handed save to deny Toni's header from Del Piero's corner having previously anticipated Giorgio Chiellini's cross into the box. Then, on the stroke of half-time, Toni appeared to have given Italy the lead with a header, but Norwegian referee Tom Henning ruled the effort out for offside. Disaster struck for Italy after the break when Gianluca Zambrotta's 57th back header towards Buffon was intercepted by a determined Mutu, who fired past the goalkeeper. However, it did not take long for Donadoni's men to hit back. Chiellini latched onto Del Piero's corner and headed towards the far post where an unmarked Panucci fired into the back of the net. The goal inspired the Italians, who surged forward more aggressively but failed to find the finishing touch. In the 73rd minute, Grosso made a vital tackle on substitute Banel Nicolita as he threatened to break clear, while at the other end Lobont made a spectacular save from Daniele De Rossi's flying header. Italy continued to surge forward but their efforts to clinch their first win on Swiss soil proved no avail and they have Buffon to thank for keeping their Euro 2008 hopes alive. With seven minutes remaining Panucci was adjudged to have pulled down Daniel Niculae in the area but Mutu's well-struck penalty was superbly kept out by Buffon with a save which saw the ball rebound off both his hand and foot before heading out for a corner. Donadoni felt his team were the superior side but also admitted the Azzurri were fortunate to be alive in the tournament after several refereeing decisions went against them. ""I don't usually speak about referees,"" said Donadoni. ""But today's refereeing was not of high quality. Let's just say the referee did not have the best of days. ""I think my players interpreted the game well, with a lot of determination. Romania are a difficult team and I think my players merit praise for what they have done today. ""Considering what we have done in terms of chances and the determination we have shown on the pitch, I think Italy have been superior to Romania."" Romania coach Victor Piturca also believed Italy were fortunate to clinch a point. ""Italy had a lucky escape,"" said Piturca. ""Maybe Mutu was a little bit overwhelmed by Buffon being a top-class goalkeeper. ""But these things happen and it will not be the first time nor the last time that a player has his spot-kick saved. I am actually more angry about how we conceded Italy's equaliser than about Mutu's penalty kick."" Piturca was nevertheless satisfied with the result, which sees his team remain unbeaten in the tournament having held France to a goalless draw on Monday. ""This is a good result for the Romanian team,"" he said. ""We have played against the world champions and against the World Cup runners-up and we have two points. We still have chances to qualify.""","Italy's Euro 2008 hopes hanging by a thread after their 1-1 draw with Romania .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- UK prosecutors may charge the parents of paralyzed rugby player Daniel James with helping their son end his life. James, center, traveled from the UK to Switzerland to commit suicide. He was 23. James, 23, from Sinton Green in western England was paralyzed from the chest down in March 2007 when a rugby scrum collapsed on top of him during match practice, dislocating his spine. Worcestershire Coroner's Service, which is conducing an inquest into the circumstances of his death, states on its Web site that James died on September 12 after he ""traveled to Switzerland with a view to ending his own life. He was admitted to a clinic where he died."" The inquest was adjourned on September 19 for reports. What do you think about assisted suicide? UK police said they questioned two people in a criminal investigation of the case. Prosecutors said Thursday they plan to review the police investigation before deciding whether to prosecute anyone. The case has renewed debate about assisted suicide in the UK, where those found guilty of helping someone kill themselves face up to 14 years in prison. Switzerland, along with Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, are the only European countries where authorities will not prosecute those who assist with suicide. Many in the UK have voiced support for Mark and Julie James, who flew to the Swiss clinic with their son.  Watch the debate on assisted suicide » . Mark Roebuck, uncle to Daniel, described the injury on a Web site for the Dan James Trust, which he set up to help his nephew's recovery. ""He dislocated his C6/C7 vertebrae, trapping his spinal cord and becoming a tetraplegic in a split second,"" Roebuck wrote. ""This means that Dan (had) lost the complete use of his body from the chest down."" James, regained some use of his fingers, Roebuck wrote, but that was the extent of his recovery. Roebuck wrote this month that his nephew had died in an assisted suicide. ""His death was an extremely sad loss,"" his parents said in a statement, ""but was no doubt a welcome relief from the prison he felt his body had become."" In a statement last week James' parents paid tribute to their son and said that he had attempted to kill himself several times already. They added that their son, ""an intelligent young man of sound mind,"" had never come to terms with his condition and was ""not prepared to live what he felt was a second-class existence"". Matt Hampson, an English rugby player who was also paralyzed from the neck down with an almost identical spinal injury in 2005, now runs a rugby Web site that supports a charity for children with spinal injuries. Hampson said he met with James briefly last year to share his experience of living with paralysis. But James' suicide, he says, was a personal choice that only James and his family can fully understand, adding: ""Who am I to judge what he did?"" ""You either get on with it or you die,"" added Hampson, who played for the England Under 21 team . ""I kind of see my role as getting on with my life to show people that, just because I've had this catastrophic injury, that doesn't mean I can't do things. I don't think my life is worse. It's a lot better in some ways."" Debbie Purdy, a 45-year-old who suffers from multiple sclerosis, says she wants the option of assisted suicide if her pain one day becomes intolerable. Purdy has a case before the High Court to clarify the law. ""I just want clarity so I know whether or not my husband Omar will be prosecuted or questioned by the police if I decide to travel abroad and he accompanies me,"" Purdy writes on the Web site for Dignity in Dying, a British group that advocates for ""patient choice at the end of life."" Dignity in Dying says the law in England and Wales is unclear regarding assisted suicide. Although no one has been prosecuted for accompanying a family member abroad for the procedure, the group says, some relatives have faced police questioning. ""I want to know what the law considers to be assisting a suicide,"" Purdy writes. ""Is Omar open to prosecution if he helps me into a taxi to the airport, or books my flights?""

"(CNN) -- U.S. and British diplomats are safe after Zimbabwe police, soldiers and ""war veterans"" stopped their convoy Thursday and threatened to burn them alive, U.S. officials said. U.S. Ambassador James McGee visits a reported victim of political violence at a Harare clinic this month. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said five American Embassy employees and two local staff members had been detained. ""While this immediate incident has been resolved, it will not be forgotten,"" McCormack said. Just hours after the incident, Zimbabwe Social Welfare Minister Nicholas Goche said that all aid organizations were ordered to cease operations in the country until the presidential runoff is concluded, a journalist in the country said. Despite Goche's announcement, Boniface Chidyausiku, the Zimbabwean ambassador to the United Nations, said CARE International was the only aid group told to suspend work. The government had accused some of the 300 CARE employees in Zimbabwe -- mostly Zimbabweans -- of passing out brochures in favor of an opposition political party, CARE spokesman Kenneth Walker said. The organization denies the charge. Chidyausiku said the Zimbabwean minister of social services is reviewing the activity of all non-governmental organizations in light of accusations that some have been politicizing their operations and campaigning for the opposition. ""What we find is that there have been complaints about NGOs operating as Trojan horses for the oppositions, but the opposition has denied it,"" he said. Henrietta Fore, administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, urged the government of Zimbabwe to ""lift the suspension on all international aid agencies involved in humanitarian work in the country."" Fore told CNN that the ""suspension is a direct threat to the lives and well-being of tens of thousands of innocent people in Zimbabwe."" The U.N. Security Council convened Thursday to discuss the diplomats' detention. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said, ""This demonstrates this is a regime that is very much out of step with international norms."" British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said the detained Britons had been engaged in ""the normal business of diplomacy."" The British diplomat and three visitors were released unharmed and allowed to go about their business, he said. ""Obviously, this is a window into the lives of Zimbabweans,"" Miliband said. ""Diplomats are protected by papers and international contacts in a way too many Zimbabweans are not protected.""  Watch U.S. official call the detentions outrageous » . Zimbabwean Deputy Information Minister Bright Matonga denied U.S. Ambassador James McGee's claims of intimidation and said the diplomats were detained after trying to flee police at a roadblock. Two U.S. Embassy cars and a British Embassy vehicle were going to check on reports of recent violence when they were stopped, McGee said. ""The police put up a roadblock, stopped the vehicles, slashed the tires, reached in and grabbed the telephones from my personnel,"" said McGee, who was not in the convoy. ""The war veterans threatened to burn the vehicles with my people inside unless they got out of the vehicles and accompanied the police to a station nearby,"" he added. Matonga said the embassy officials were traveling in an area they didn't have authorization to enter. ""They went to an area without informing the foreign affairs,"" Matonga said. ""It is very mischievous. And we know why you are doing it, but the police will stop this."" McCormack called the assertion that officials were not informed ""absurd."" Zimbabwe officials have accused members of the U.S. ambassador's office of trying to aid the opposition party in the coming presidential runoff. When McGee found out that embassy personnel were detained, he sent an embassy security officer to the scene to see whether he could help, he said. Police extracted the security officer, a local, from the car and beat him, McGee said. ""These are diplomatic-plated vehicles. They knew exactly who was in those vehicles,"" McGee said. ""This government is not following their own laws and definitely not following any international laws."" He added, ""Zimbabwe has become a lawless country."" Matonga argued that the diplomats were detained because they wouldn't ""comply"" with police and tried to flee a roadblock. He denied outright that a U.S. Embassy employee was beaten and that Zimbabwean forces slashed the tires of an U.S. Embassy vehicle. However, he said soldiers may have taken diplomats to the ground when they tried to flee. According to the U.S. State Department, McGee and diplomats from five other missions in Harare were detained and questioned by Zimbabwe's security forces May 13. McGee and diplomats from the United Kingdom, the European Union, Japan, Tanzania and the Netherlands had just visited a hospital, the State Department reported. On May 8, McGee penned a statement, officially breaking his silence on the political violence wracking Zimbabwe. ""I feel compelled, as a supporter of human rights, to speak out about the atrocities being committed across Zimbabwe,"" McGee wrote, saying the U.S. had received more than 700 reports of violence. ""The violence cannot be allowed to continue. I will continue to speak out clearly and forcefully to demand its end."" He continued, ""Let me also be clear that the U.S. is aware of the identities of many of those responsible for instigating the violence and for carrying it out.  We will continue to gather evidence of the atrocities being committed so that the guilty can one day be brought to justice."" Though reports of violence have been common in Zimbabwe, there has been a significant uptick in attacks since the March 29 elections. Voters cast more ballots for opposition candidate Morgan Tsvangirai than for President Robert Mugabe, who has been in power since the African nation gained its independence 28 years ago. After the election, the country's electoral commission reported that neither candidate received more than 50 percent of the vote. A runoff is scheduled for June 27. Since the election, opposition and church groups have reported kidnappings, torture and other violence, including the deaths of opposition party members. They say the violence targets opponents of Mugabe and his Zanu-PF party.","NEW: Zimbabwe orders aid groups to stop field work .

"(CNN) -- Federal officials postponed poisoning a mile-long stretch of the Rio Grande's banks this week after residents complained that doing so posed health and environmental risks on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border. A Border Patrol agent moves through dense cane on the banks of the Rio Grande near Laredo, Texas, last year. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said it wants to eradicate the invasive Carrizo cane infesting many portions of the Rio Grande's banks between Texas and Mexico. The lanky cane provides cover for immigrants crossing the border illegally and poses a danger to Border Patrol agents trying to stop them, said Chuck Prichard, spokesman for CBP's Laredo sector. ""Someone can be in the cane and be 3 feet away from them, and you cannot see them,"" Prichard said during a Wednesday phone interview. ""[A Border Patrol agent] could literally be surrounded and have no idea."" The controversy over the test project comes as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visits Mexico to discuss border security and other issues concerning U.S.-Mexico relations. Applying herbicides on a 1.1-mile stretch of the U.S. side of the river was part of a test project, Prichard said, but the CBP decided to postpone the $2.1 million experiment to address community concerns. Residents of two Hispanic communities near Laredo, Texas -- Barrio de Colores and Barrio El Cuatro -- filed a lawsuit late Tuesday asking a federal court to intervene. Prichard said Wednesday morning he was unaware of the lawsuit. Among the complaints in the lawsuit, the communities allege the CBP failed to assess the environmental impact adequately, failed to consider reasonable alternatives and failed to notify the public adequately. Though three herbicides were originally proposed, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers settled on imazapyr for the test project, Prichard said. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said there is ""reasonable certainty of no harm from aggregate exposure to imazapyr residues."" ""Imazapyr technical is relatively nontoxic via the oral route of exposure, and only slightly toxic via the dermal and inhalation routes of exposure,"" the agency has said. Jay Johnson-Castro Sr., a vocal opponent of the project and executive director of the Rio Grande International Study Center, said the studies on the herbicide are insufficient. ""I've lived long enough to know what the government says is safe isn't always safe,"" he said. The 1.1-mile test stretch of the Rio Grande forms a sharp bend between Laredo and Nuevo Laredo, Mexico. The river serves as a water source for both. Laredo Mayor Raul Salinas said he believes the federal officials have good intentions and that some misinformation has been disseminated regarding the proposal. He said he welcomes the delay so that the CBP can address community concerns. ""I'm going to make sure we protect our police officers and Border Patrol,"" said Salinas, a former FBI agent. ""I just want to make sure it will have zero impact on humans, the water, our environment."" The CBP seeks to use three methods of Carrizo eradication along the stretch of the river: manually cutting the cane and topically applying herbicide to the stalks; using shovels, pickaxes, excavators and backhoes to dig the cane up by its roots; and using helicopters to spray the bank aerially. The latter is the most troubling, said Johnson-Castro, because aerially spraying could affect more than just the Carrizo. The CBP would evaluate the products of each method before proposing an eradication program for a 16-mile stretch of the river, Prichard said, adding that the CBP is considering other options as well. One option could involve the import of tiny Arundo wasps, which feed on the cane and lay eggs in it, stunting the cane's growth. Carrizo, which can grow up to 30 feet high, is a Spanish transplant to Texas. The wasp is a Mediterranean native. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is experimenting with the wasp on a different section of the Rio Grande and is sharing its data with the CBP, Prichard said. The USDA has concerns that Carrizo chokes off native plants and has an insatiable thirst, capable of annually sucking up 500 gallons of water per square yard. Prichard said the CBP wants to re-evaluate its test proposal because it doesn't want to eradicate the cane at ""the expense of the environment or anyone who lives in the area."" ""I own a house in Laredo. I drink the water that comes out of the tap,"" Prichard said. ""We're trying to do the right thing for everybody involved."" In addition to concerns from the U.S. side of the border, Prichard said the city of Nuevo Laredo also expressed reservations -- namely that the stretch hosting the experiment is near the intake point for Nuevo Laredo's water supply. Johnson-Castro of the Rio Grande International Study Center said the concerns of Nuevo Laredo citizens are warranted because the effects of such widespread use of imazapyr are unclear. Not only are humans at risk, he said, but there are about 1,000 species residing in the area slated for testing, and the nesting season for migrant birds is quickly approaching. Opponents aren't against eradicating the Carrizo, Johnson-Castro said. They're not even opposed to using herbicides. They just want to make sure that herbicides are used responsibly and in a targeted manner and that the CBP considers all options for mitigating the cane. For instance, he said, donkeys and goats enjoy eating the cane. And earlier this month, about 70 students from Texas A&M International University manually were able to clear about an acre of cane in fewer than three hours. ""Let's get down to reasonableness, logic and fairness here. It's an issue of morality on one side and of science on the other side,"" Johnson-Castro said. ""We don't think citizens of either country should be Guinea pigs.""","Herbicide was to be sprayed on cane along 1.1-mile stretch of river .

"(CNN) -- Circles Robinson is a 55-year-old American who has lived in Havana with his family since 2001. He works revising English translations for official Cuban media online publications and in his spare time he writes his own blog and manages the Havana Times Web site. Circles Robinson: ""There are fantastic cultural opportunities in Havana."" CNN: What makes Havana special to you? Circles: Havana is the only capital city I've seen that I would want to live in. One big reason is that there are relatively few cars, making the city pedestrian-friendly. Another is that it's quite safe for a capital and you feel like the night is your ally instead of your adversary. Havana is full of contrasts that make life interesting: buildings being restored amid others collapsing. There's an amazing array of cultural activities but it can be hard to buy a nail or cat food or even a roll of toilet paper sometimes. I love the parks, the Malecon seawall and the ever-expanding network of museums that give you the feeling there is always something new to see on a weekend stroll. And Havana is virtually free of commercial advertising. The TV and other media are ad-free as well, and I love that. CNN: What are your favorite parts of the city? Circles: The Malecon seawall is a great place to think, relax and observe, because of its majestic views, sea breeze and mix of characters from all walks of life. I also love the sprawling grounds, stone walls and magnificent view of the city at the San Carlos de la Cabana Fortress across Havana Bay. The Latinoamericano baseball stadium is also special for a fan like me. Out on the east side of the city the beaches are fantastic. We try to go once every few months and more often in the summer. Vedado is my favorite district. It has many large parks, beautiful tree-lined streets and a mix of extremely interesting 20th-century architecture. Of course, Old Havana is gorgeous, with all the excellent restoration work and many museums. I usually find myself going there when I have visitors to show around. CNN: What do you dislike about life in Havana? Circles: The overcrowded housing situation and deteriorated buildings in some parts of the city make for some difficult living situations and many things only work halfway. There's a thick bureaucratic maze to accomplish many simple tasks. Most people need to do something under-the-table to get by and there are some seemingly ridiculous prohibitions. What makes Havana special to you? Let us know. CNN: What's a typical weekend in the city? Circles: There are fantastic cultural opportunities in Havana and they are very accessible to all, normally costing from 10 to 50 U.S. cents for a ticket. My wife and I often go to the theater, to movies, dance performances and concerts. I like jazz a lot and this Friday there's an outdoor jam session around the time when people get off work. On Saturday there's an early evening informal free concert on the porch of an art gallery. There's also a film festival offering young filmmakers' works and there are numerous venues for stand up comedians, which are a big favorite of the general population. CNN: Cuban music is known throughout the world. Where are the best places in Havana to hear real Cuban music? Circles: I much prefer what they call the ""penas"" -- more intimate sessions where friends and followers show up. Many groups have regular ""penas"" once or twice a month, where you might hear folk, rumba or jazz. These performances are held at a variety of places, outdoor and indoor, and most are free. For more formal concerts I particularly like the theater at the Cuban Fine Arts Museum and the smaller hall at the Amadeo Roldan Theater. The Teatro America also offers a good variety of musical presentations. Some of the best venues for salsa are the outdoor ones. There are outdoor auditoriums in most neighborhoods, like the Tropical's Salon Rosada in Buena Vista, La Bereda in La Lisa, and El Patio de la Salsa in La Virgen del Camino, where you can see the top salsa bands for under a dollar. You can also see top salsa bands for free at the weekend at venues set up in squares or plazas. CNN: What do you think the future has in store for Havana? Circles: The potential is awesome. If the hostile policy of the U.S. towards Cuba could turn into a good-neighbor policy, or at least more normal ties, the economy of the city would no doubt improve. If the travel ban was lifted people from the U.S. could appreciate all that Havana has to offer. Likewise, if the rest of the blockade was lifted it would present a great challenge to the city's government to get beyond a virtual state of siege and be able to confront its serious infrastructural needs, housing deficit and, in some areas, highly deficient public works and utilities. An onslaught of visitors would also put services to the test and most likely require improvements. CNN: If Havana was a person what would he or she be like? Circles: He or she would be casually sensuous, timeless, sassy and either 'tranquillo' or combative depending on how the day's going.","Circles Robinson is an American who has lived in Havana since 2001 .

Obama speaks about his grandmother often on the stump, describing her as an integral figure in his youth who struggled against the glass ceiling in to make a better life for him. ""She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life,"" he said in his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in August. ""She poured everything she had into me. And although she can no longer travel, I know that she's watching tonight, and that tonight is her night as well."" He and his family traveled to Hawaii in August to visit her. The Obama team made the announcement after a busy day of trading attacks with Sen. John McCain on the Democratic presidential hopeful's readiness for office. Monday also marked the first time that Obama appeared with Sen. Hillary Clinton during the general election season. Clinton went to Florida, a state she won in the primary but whose delegates she could not claim, to urge her supporters to turn out for Obama on Election Day. Clinton called Orlando and central Florida ""the battleground of the battleground"" and practically begged the crowd to vote early. ""We are 15 days from the finish line and we cannot falter, we cannot stop, we cannot take a single vote for granted,"" Clinton said Monday. ""I am asking you to work as hard for Barack as you worked for me. If you made phone calls for me, make them for Barack. If you walked streets for me, make them for Barack. If you talked to your friends and neighbors for me, do it again for Barack. We cannot risk four more years of the same failed Republican policies."" Earlier in the day, McCain told a crowd in Belton, Missouri, that the next president ""won't have time to get used to the office."" He was addressing comments made Sunday by Obama's running mate, Sen. Joe Biden, in which he said Obama would be tested within the first six months of his presidency. ""We don't want a president who invites testing from the world at a time when our economy is in crisis and Americans are already fighting in two wars,"" McCain said. ""What is more troubling is that Sen. Biden told their campaign donors that when that crisis hits, they would have to stand with them because it wouldn't be apparent Sen. Obama would have the right response. The Obama-Biden campaign released a pre-emptive response after reading McCain's scheduled remarks. ""With our nation facing two wars and 21st century threats abroad, Sen. Biden referenced the simple fact that history shows presidents face challenges from day one,"" Obama spokesman David Wade said. ""After eight years of a failed foreign policy, we need Barack Obama's good judgment and steady leadership, not the erratic and ideological Bush-McCain approach that has set back our security and standing in the world."" Earlier Monday, Obama denounced the ""say-anything, do-anything politics"" of McCain's camp, but said ""careless, outrageous comments"" won't distract him from addressing the nation's ills. Obama added that Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, McCain's running mate, rejected some of the tactics when she spoke out against a flood of automated phone calls tying Obama to former radical William Ayers. The calls were reported in several battleground states. ""It's getting so bad that even Sen. McCain's running mate denounced his tactics last night,"" Obama said at a campaign event in Tampa, Florida. ""As you know, you really have to work hard to violate Gov. Palin's standards on negative campaigning."" Sunday night, Palin told reporters traveling with her that if she had her way, the McCain campaign and the Republican National Committee would not be flooding battleground states with the automated phone calls, which she said the Obama campaign was using too. Over the next 15 days, Obama said Monday, he will continue his quest for the Oval Office while disregarding the divisive politics that he said McCain is endorsing ""to keep us from working together."" The McCain campaign, meanwhile, continued its weekend assault on Obama's tax plan, which it called an attempt to ""spread the wealth."" iReport.com: Send your questions for Sen. John McCain . Speaking at a campaign event in St. Charles, Missouri, a chorus of boos rang out as the Arizona senator described his take on the plan. ""He believes in redistributing wealth -- not in policies that grow our economy and create jobs and opportunities for all Americans. Sen. Obama is more interested in controlling who gets your piece of the pie than in growing the pie."" In Colorado Springs, Colorado, Palin also continued her line of attack from the weekend, but softened her tone in that she didn't call Obama's plan socialism.  Watch Palin say Obama sounds like a socialist » . Over the weekend, Palin and Sen. Mel Martinez, a Cuban-American GOP senator from Florida, called Obama's plan socialism. Martinez compared the plan to the tax structure in communist Cuba. McCain has taken a softer tone. On Sunday, he dodged a question from Fox News' Chris Wallace about whether Obama was a socialist, but said his rival's tax plan was an effort ""to spread the wealth."" ""That's one of the tenets of socialism,"" McCain said.  Watch Obama defend his plan » . Obama's tax plan calls for tax relief for 95 percent of workers and their families. Though nonpartisan tax policy organizations agree that 40 percent of Americans don't pay income tax, many of those are lower-income earners who file payroll taxes through their employers. See the fact check . After receiving an endorsement from Colin Powell, a former Republican secretary of state and retired Army general, Obama asked if Powell and billionaire Warren Buffett -- No. 2 on Forbes magazine's 2008 list of richest Americans -- would have extended their backing if he was a socialist.  Watch Obama explain Powell's influence » . Obama said he simply wants to give the middle class a tax cut. Powell came to Obama's defense after endorsing the senator from Illinois. Powell said he had grown tired of McCain's negative campaigning and that the American people would prefer to focus on issues like education, infrastructure and the economy. He specifically slammed Palin's allegation that Obama's tax plan is socialist, calling it misleading. iReport.com: What do you think about Powell's endorsement?

"(CNN) -- Pirates hijacked three ships off the coast of Somalia on Thursday in the ""worst number of attacks"" in one day in many years, an international maritime watchdog said. An image of the Burum Ocean -- a suspected pirate mother  ship in the Gulf of Aden. ""Four attacks in two days, ships being hijacked and crews being taken, and large ransoms being demanded is completely unacceptable,"" said Capt. Pottengal Mukudan of the International Maritime Bureau, which monitors shipping crime. Pirates fired at a ship sailing under an Iranian flag and boarded it about 5:20 a.m. local time Thursday (10:20 p.m. ET Wednesday), said Noel Chong, head of the International Chamber of Commerce's Piracy Reporting Centre, a multinational coalition naval task force that monitors the region . They hijacked a ship operating under a Japanese flag a few minutes later, he said. A German ship was hijacked about 8 a.m. local time, Mukudan said. He said the pirates are still on board the German vessel, but he had few details. Pirate attacks are frequent in the waters off Somalia, a notoriously unsafe area for unescorted vessels. Canada announced this month that it was dispatching a warship to the area to protect U.N. aid ships after more than two dozen reported pirate attacks in the region this year. ""This is the worst number of attacks that we have seen in a short period of time for years,"" Mukudan said, calling on CTF-150 to ""give piracy a much higher priority to bring this under control. There have been seven vessels [hijacked] since the 20th of July."" Thursday's spate of attacks in the Gulf of Aden came two days after pirates boarded a Malaysian tanker off the coast of Somalia. They continue to hold it, Chong said. The IMB monitors shipping crime and reported Thursday's incidents to CTF-150, which is based in Djibouti, and the task force is ""monitoring the situation,"" Mukudan said. ""They have some of their vessels ,which are tracking some of these hijacked ships, but the problem is it's very difficult to take action once the hijackers are on board,"" he said. ""The lives of the hostages is at risk."" He said he understood that the task force was busy with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan but noted that the IMB would like to see the task force do more to respond to the problem before the hijackings occur. The IMB said in April that 49 pirate attacks on ships were reported in the first three months of 2008, compared with 41 for the same period last year. It recorded 263 pirates attacks last year, up from 239 the year before and the first increase in three years.

"(CNN) -- A former B-2 Bomber engineer has been sentenced to 32 years in prison for selling secret defense designs to China. Noshir Gowadia, 66, of Maui, Hawaii, was sentenced late Monday for sharing classified defense information with China, illegally exporting military technical data, money laundering, filing false tax returns and other offenses. ""Mr. Gowadia provided some of our country's most sensitive weapons-related designs to the Chinese government for money,"" said David Kris, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's National Security Division. ""He is now being held accountable for his actions,"" Kris said. ""This prosecution should serve as a warning to others who would compromise our nation's military secrets for profit."" Gowadia worked as an engineer with Northrop Grumman Corporation for about 17 years, according to evidence at his trial. There he helped develop features for the B-2 Spirit Bomber, also known as the ""Stealth Bomber."" Between July 2003 and June 2005, Gowadia made six trips to China to provide design, data analysis and test support services needed to develop a stealthy exhaust nozzle for a cruise missile system, according his trial evidence. Prosecutors said Gowadia pocketed at least $110,000 from China. A federal jury in Honolulu convicted Gowadia last August. Last Friday, a Michigan man was sentenced to a four-year prison term for conspiring to provide national defense information to Chinese intelligence officials, according to the Justice Department.

"London, England (CNN) -- Something is stirring within the Hamas body politic, a moderating trend that, if nourished and engaged, could transform Palestinian politics and the Arab-Israeli peace process. There are unmistakable signs that the religiously based radical movement has subtly changed its uncompromising posture on Israel. For example, in the last few months top Hamas officials have publicly stressed that they want to be part of the solution of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, not part of the problem. What is happening inside Hamas' mosques and social base shows a concerted effort on the part of its leadership to re-educate its rank and file about co-existence with the Jewish state and in so doing mentally prepare them for a permanent settlement in the future. In Gazan mosques, pro-Hamas clerics have begun to cite the example of Salah al-Din al-Ayubi, a famed Muslim military commander and statesman, who, after liberating Jerusalem from the Western Crusaders, allowed them to retain a coastal state of their own. The moral lesson of the story is that if the famed leader could tolerate the warring, bloodthirsty Crusaders, then today's Palestinians should be willing to live peacefully with a Jewish state in their midst. This story is important because it provides Hamas with religious legitimacy and allows it to justify and explain its change of direction to followers. As an Islamic-based movement, Hamas' very raison d'etre rests on religious legitimization, and its leaders understand that they neglect that at their peril. Hamas' recent narrative marks a pronounced departure from the past in which Hamas moderates called for a minor or long-term truce. Now Hamas leaders appear to be going further by laying the ground for a shift in their position by educating their social base about the requirements of permanent peace -- recognition of the Jewish state. Although the evolution of Hamas' stance on the peace process has been slow, gradual and qualified, in the last three years many of its leaders repeatedly have said they wanted a two-state solution. Pressed by an Australian journalist on policy changes that Hamas might make to any new order, Khaled Meshaal, the top Hamas leader and head of its political bureau based in Syria and considered a hard-liner, asserted that the organization has already shifted on several key points: ""Hamas already changed -- we accepted the national accords for a Palestinian state based on 1967 borders, and we took part in the 2006 Palestinian elections."" Over the years, I have interviewed more than a dozen Hamas leaders inside and outside the Palestinian territories. Although, on the whole, Hamas' public rhetoric calls for the liberation of all historic Palestine, not only the territories occupied in 1967, a healthier debate occurs within. My recent conversations with Hamas' rank and file suggest that the militant organization has evolved considerably since the group unexpectedly won power in Gaza in free elections in 2006. Before then, Hamas was known for its suicide bombers, not its bureaucrats. But that had to change. ""It is much more difficult to run a government than to oppose and resist Israeli occupation,"" a senior Hamas leader told me while on official business in Egypt in 2007. ""If we do not provide the goods to our people, they'll disown us."" Ironically, in spite of the West's refusal to regard this government as legitimate, the democratic demands for governance from within Gaza are themselves driving change within Hamas. What is striking about Hamas' recent shift of opinion toward the peace process is that it has come at a trying time for the Islamist organization which, in the last two years, has faced critical challenges from al Qaeda-like jihadist groups, a low-intensity civil war with rival Fatah, the ruling party of the Palestinian Authority, and a deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza. Last summer a militant group called Jund Ansar Allah, or the Warriors of God, one of a handful of radical al Qaeda-inspired factions, declared the establishment of an Islamic caliphate in Gaza, a flagrant rejection of Hamas' authority. Hamas security forces struck instantly and mercilessly at the Warriors, killing more than 20 members, including the group's leader, Abdel-Latif Moussa. In one stroke, the Hamas leadership sent a message to its foes and friends that it will not tolerate the existence of global jihadist groups such as al Qaeda: Hamas will not allow al Qaeda-inspired factions to turn Gaza into a theater to wage transnational jihad. However, the challenge to Hamas' authority persists. Israel's punishing siege of Gaza, in place since 2007, along with the suffering and despair it has caused to its 1.4 million inhabitants, has driven hundreds of young Palestinians into the arms of small Salafist extremist factions that accuse Hamas of forfeiting the armed struggle and failing to implement Quranic or Shariah law. Operationally and ideologically, there are huge differences between Hamas and al Qaeda and its various inspired factions, and a lot of bad blood. Hamas is a broad-based religious/nationalist resistance whose focus and violence is limited to Palestine/Israel, while al Qaeda is a small, transnational terrorist group that has carried out attacks worldwide. Thus Hamas, unlike al Qaeda and other fringe factions, is not merely an armed militia but a viable social movement with a large popular base that has been estimated at more than half a million supporters and sympathizers. Hamas also has shown itself to be sensitive and responsive to Palestinian public opinion. A further example of its political and social priorities is Hamas' decision to engage seriously with an Egyptian-brokered deal that sketches out a path to peace with rival Fatah. Despite its reactionary rhetoric, Hamas is a rational actor, a conclusion reached by former Mossad chief Ephraim Halevy, who also was Ariel Sharon's national security adviser and who is certainly not an Israeli peacenik. The Hamas leadership has undergone a transformation ""right under our very noses"" by recognizing that ""its ideological goal is not attainable and will not be in the foreseeable future,"" Halevy wrote in Yedioth Ahronoth a few months ago. His verdict is that Hamas is now ready and willing to accept the establishment of a Palestinian state within the temporary borders of 1967. Yet if Hamas is so eager to accept a two-state solution, why doesn't it simply announce that it recognizes Israel's existence and promise to negotiate a peace deal that allows the two countries to coexist? In interviews with Hamas officials, they stress that their organization has made significant concessions to the so-called Quartet's three conditions, though the Quartet (the United Nations, Russia, United States and European Union) has not lifted the punishing sanctions against Hamas nor has it effectively pressed Israel. Hamas' diplomatic starting point will be to demand that Israel recognizes the nationalist rights of the Palestinians and withdraws from the occupied territories, but it will not be its final position. There could be no viable, lasting peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians if Hamas is not consulted about peacemaking and if the Palestinians remain divided with two warring authorities in the West Bank and in Gaza. Hamas has the means and public support to undermine any agreement that does not address the legitimate rights and claims of the Palestinian people. Its rival, Fatah and the Palestinian Authority, lacks a popular mandate and the legitimacy needed to implement a resolution of the conflict. President Mahmoud Abbas has been politically weakened by a series of blunders of his own making and by pressure by the U.S., compromising his moral authority in the eyes of a sizable Palestinian constituency. If, instead of ignoring Hamas or, worse yet, seeking its overthrow, the United States and Europe engaged the Islamically based organization, diplomatically and politically, and encouraged it to continue moderating its views, the West could test the extent of Hamas' evolution and find out if the organization is willing to accept a settlement based on the two-state solution. So far, the strategy of isolating and militarily confronting Hamas pursued by Israel and the Bush administration has not appeared to weaken the organization dramatically. If anything, what success this strategy has had in undermining Hamas has been counterproductive, since it has radicalized hundreds of young Palestinians who have joined extremist al Qaeda-inspired factions and reinforced the culture of martyrdom and nihilism. To break this impasse, and prevent further gains by more extremist factions, the U.S. and Europe should support a unified Palestinian government that could negotiate peace with Israel. The ongoing Egyptian-brokered truce deal between Hamas and Fatah is an opportunity that may be built on to repair and strengthen intra-Palestinian governing institutions that have been frayed as a result of intense rivalry in the last two years. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Fawaz A. Gerges.","There are signs Hamas is taking new stance on Israel, Fawaz A. Gerges says .

"(CNN) -- The stepmother of 10-year-old Zahra Baker told police the girl was killed two weeks before she was reported missing, according to search warrants released Tuesday. Stepmother Elisa Baker also told police in Hickory, North Carolina, that the disabled girl's body was disposed of the next day, September 25, in various locations, according to the documents. She told police on November 19 that the girl's father, Adam Baker, dismembered the girl, and the couple disposed of the remains. While Elisa Baker has been charged with obstruction of justice -- for writing a fake ransom note and leaving it at the family's Hickory home -- no one has been charged directly in the girl's death. Elisa Baker also is accused of writing worthless checks. Police have said she had been cooperating with investigators. One of the search warrants details an online conversation a web user said she had with Adam and/or Elisa Baker ""regarding their involvement with chainsaw massacre role-playing."" According to the warrant, ""the date of September 22 was given regarding their virtual family 'doing a murder with chainsaws.'"" Elisa Baker's former husband also was involved in role-playing, according to the conversation. Catawba Superior Court Judge Robert C. Ervin released the 30 search warrants that provide more insight into the grisly killing of the freckled-face girl, who lost part of her left leg at age 5 to cancer. Eleven search warrants were released in December. Police found some of Zahra Baker's remains on November 11, just over a month after she was reported her missing. In October, Adam Baker, who denied he was involved in Zahra's disappearance, tearfully called for the return of his daughter. Investigators reviewed Adam Baker's cell phone records and the phone's GPS locator from September 25, the warrants say. According to those records, Adam Baker's phone was not in the areas where Zahra's remains were found on the day that Elisa Baker said he disposed of them, the warrants say. Elisa Baker's cell phone records indicate that her phone was in those areas on that day, the warrants say. According to the warrants, Elisa Baker told Adam Baker that a man she said was her brother actually was her husband. She married Adam Baker before the divorce, police said. CNN left messages Tuesday evening with the attorneys for Elisa and Adam Baker. In one of the search warrants released in December, a tipster told police that Zahra had been at a North Carolina home with two men and one of the men said ""he had done something very bad and needed to leave town."" One of the men was associated with Zahra's stepmother but was not Zahra's father, the tipster said. The tipster also told police that Zahra had been raped by both men and that she had blood on her private area and legs, the search warrant said. The tipster told police that he got the information about the alleged rape from a friend who was told about it from his sister. Police went to the home to see if they could confirm the fourth-hand information and found a mattress at the side of the house that ""had a large dark stain in the middle,"" the search warrant said. The tipster said the men did not admit to killing the girl but did say that they ""might have hit her in the head,"" the search warrant said. Adam Baker was arrested in late October in nearby Catawba County on eight charges: five counts of writing bad checks and three counts of failing to appear in court. Authorities said the charges were unrelated to Zahra's disappearance, and he was later released on bail. The disappearance of Zahra made international news. The girl, whose biological parents were both from Australia, lost part of her left leg at age 5 and lost hearing in both ears while being treated for cancer.","Stepmother claims girl's father dismembered body .

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- Authorities captured four suspects who allegedly participated in the ambush and killing of 12 federal police officers last week in southwestern Mexico, the state-run news agency Notimex said. Police present suspected drug dealer Jose Alberto Lopez Barron to the media Wednesday in Mexico City. The arrests follow a deployment of federal police that nearly quadrupled the number of forces in the state of Michoacan, which has recently been a flashpoint in the government's battle against drug trafficking. Among those arrested was Jose Alberto Lopez Barron, who had a handgun that was traced to one of the slain officers, federal police said at a news conference, Notimex reported. The other three alleged drug cartel members -- Gamaliel Rodriguez Granados, Evaristo Armas Bello and Jaime Rafael Navarro -- were captured aboard a taxi in a town in Michoacan, Notimex said. All are believed to have taken direct orders from the boss of the La Familia Michoacana cartel, a group that has become exceedingly violent in recent months, Notimex said. The 12 slain off-duty police officers were found on the side of a remote highway July 14. The killings were among a series of reprisals by La Familia after the federal police captured one of their top leaders, authorities said.","Four arrested in deaths of 12 federal officers last week in southwestern Mexico .

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN)  -- Suspected drug cartel leaders in Mexico don't often answer reporters' questions, although one did call a radio station a few days ago to offer the government a deal. Police escort suspected drug cartel leader Jose Alberto Lopez Barron on Wednesday in Mexico City. So it was rather unusual for Jose Alberto Lopez Barron to speak to journalists shouting at him during a police lineup Wednesday, opening up a new window on how his reputed cartel operates. Lopez Barron was arrested this week in connection with the torture and killings of 12 federal police agents in Michoacan state July 13. Mexican federal officials say Lopez Barron, also known as ""El Gordo,"" is one of the top leaders of La Familia Michoacana, a drug cartel blamed for a rash of violence that has left at least 18 federal agents and two soldiers dead since July 11. Speaking in a calm manner, Lopez Barron said that even if the cartel acted outside the law, it operates in an orderly manner and under rules that not only cartel members have to obey, but also residents in Arteaga, one of the cities the cartel controls. ""You can't go around shooting off guns,"" Lopez Barron said. ""You can't go around killing people, not only us but for the whole town. You can't speed in your vehicle. You can't traffick any kinds of drugs without telling us first."" Anyone who wants to sell drugs, he said, has to go through the Familia Michoacana. ""It has to be the company's merchandise,"" Lopez Barron said. ""He has someone there who I believe is in charge of distributing cocaine."" Cocaine can be sold retail, he said, but not methamphetamine, known as crystal or ice, since La Familia has prohibited it in the whole state. Lopez Barron said his direct boss was Servando Gomez, known as ""La Tuta."" Authorities said Gomez is La Familia Michoacana's top leader. Gomez went on a radio show recently to offer a truce with the federal government. Mexican President Felipe Calderon quickly answered that the government does not make pacts with criminal organizations. Lopez Barron said authorities have tried to capture Gomez but local residents have protected him. ""Elements from the federal investigations agency arrived in town -- I wouldn't know the exact number of agents -- and we had to leave town for the hills. We arrived at a small ranch called La Peña, and they gave us nourishment and refuge."" The suspect said municipal authorities respect the cartel and it respects the local police. He said that although the sale of drugs has diminished, the cartel has not stopped paying local police for protection. Lopez Barron was one of four suspects arrested this week in connection the slayings of the 12 federal agents in southwestern Mexico. Officials said he had a handgun that was traced to one of the slain officers. The other three suspects -- Gamaliel Rodriguez Granados, Evaristo Armas Bello and Jaime Rafael Navarro -- were captured inside a taxi in a town in Michoacan, officials said.

"(CNN) -- Jhonattan Vegas has made history at the Bob Hope Classic, winning a three-man play-off on the Palmer course at La Quinta to become the first Venezuelan in history to claim a PGA Tour title. The 26-year-old Vegas, who was making just his fifth appearance on tour, made a 13-foot par putt on the second play-off hole to defeat Gary Woodland, after defending champion Bill Haas had been eliminated on the first play-off hole. After missing a nine-foot putt that would have secured victory on the final hole of regulation play, Vegas then improbably became the first rookie to win the 52-year-old tournament with a spectacular up-and-down after knocking his 92nd tee shot into the water 160-yards from the hole. ""Just to think about winning on the PGA Tour, that's one thing,"" Vegas told the official PGA Tour website. ""But to actually make it happen -- that is something else, and it's a crazy feeling,"" he added. ""I hope this means a lot to my country. I really hope it means people changing their minds about the sport,"" continued Vegas -- who collected a near $1m winner's cheque as well as a two-year Tour exemption and an invitation to the Masters in April. Vegas' win is expected to boost his desire to revive golf in Venezuela, where  President Hugo Chavez has decried the sport as a pastime of the rich and has closed six courses in seven years.

Haas, who was trying to become the first back-to-back Bob Hope champion since Johnny Miller in 1976, fired a final round 66 in the 90-hole tournament.

"(CNN) -- Inter Milan's faultless record under new coach Leonardo came to an abrupt halt on Sunday as the reigning Serie A champions lost 3-1 to Udinese. Inter were on course for their sixth straight win since the Brazilian took over from Rafa Benitez in December when Dejan Stankovic gave them the lead after a quarter of an hour. But Udinese struck back almost immediately with goals from Cristian Zapata after 20 minutes and Antonio Di Natale five minutes later. Maurizio Domizzi added the home side's third in the 69th minute leaving Inter too much to do in the final 20 minutes of the match. The result means Udinese stay in eighth place, but are now only one point behind Palermo. Inter remain in fifth with 35 points. Rivals AC Milan moved four points clear at the top of the league as they beat Cesena 2-0 at the San Siro. An own goal by Cesena defender Pellegrino at the end of the first half gave Milan the lead. The Rossoneri had several chances to wrap up the match in the second half with Robinho going close twice, but it was left to the ever dependable Ibrahimovic to make sure of the points as he slotted home from a tight angle in injury time. Cesena ninth away defeat of the season means they remain in 18th place with 19 points. Napoli moved up to second behind leaders Milan after a 2-0 win at Bari. Argentina's Ezequiel Lavezzi put Napoli ahead after 38 minutes with a well-taken free-kick. Uruguayan striker Edinson Cavani made sure of three points shortly before the end scoring his 14th goal of the season. Lazio failed to make up any ground on Milan after slumping to a shock 3-1 defeat at Bologna. Lazio took the lead in the fifth minute thanks to Sergio Floccari, but Gaston Ramirez leveled the scores half an hour later. Three minutes later the home side were ahead as striker Marco Di Vaio carved through the Lazio defense before finishing neatly.

"Washington (CNN) -- Miriam Regalado sued her employer for alleged gender discrimination. Three weeks later, the company fired her fiancé, citing ""performance issues."" The couple then sued, claiming job retaliation for the original complaint aimed specifically at the man. On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down a unanimous ruling favoring the couple and concluding that federal protections can include third-party victims of retaliation. In an 8-0 ruling, the high court said Eric Thompson had ""standing"" to file his own lawsuit to address the injuries he said he suffered as a result of the retaliation. ""Accepting the facts as alleged, Thompson is not an accidental victim of the retaliation -- collateral damage, so to speak of the employer's unlawful act,"" Justice Antonin Scalia said. ""To the contrary, injuring him was the employer's intended means of harming Regalado."" The decision allows Thompson to continue his lawsuit against Kentucky-based North American Stainless. The case began when Regalado, one of just a few female engineers at the plant, filed a gender discrimination claim in February 2003. She alleged that male supervisors treated her unfairly. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits companies from retaliating against workers who report discrimination based on sex, race or religion. Three weeks after the complaint was filed with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Thompson was dismissed from his job as a metallurgical engineer. He then filed his own separate retaliation claim. Lower federal courts were divided over whether he could pursue such a lawsuit. A federal appeals court in Cincinnati, Ohio, ultimately dismissed the case, concluding that Thompson did not himself engage in any ""statutorily protected activity,"" such as protesting his fiancée's treatment or assisting in her complaint. Thompson and Regalado are now married. There was no immediate comment from them or the company to the ruling. The Obama administration had supported Thompson, and then-Solicitor General Elena Kagan had filed supporting legal briefs in the appeal last year. She has since been named the Supreme Court and recused herself from the case to avoid an appearance of conflict. At oral arguments last month, both the company and the couple agreed that Regalado had the right to file her lawsuit alleging that Thompson's firing was retaliation. The company denied the specific claims and said Thompson himself could not bring the separate lawsuit. Scalia, in an eight-page opinion, concluded that the case for Thomspon was clear-cut. The anti-retaliation provision in Title VII is ""worded broadly,"" he said. ""We think it obvious that a reasonable worker might be dissuaded from engaging in protected activity if she knew that her fiancé would be fired."" In a concurring opinion, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg added a ""fortifying observation"": that Equal Employment Opportunity Commission rules clearly give Thompson -- even though he was not married to Regalado -- the right to press his allegations in court. Ginsburg has long been a champion of gender equality on the job. She issued a famous dissent in 2007 after the high court dismissed a workplace discrimination lawsuit by tire manager Lily Ledbetter. She alleged being paid less than her male counterparts for equal work over about two decades but did not find out about the discrimination until she was about to retire. President Obama, in the first bill he signed when taking office in 2009, signed the Lily Ledbetter Act into law. It nullified the high court decision and said every new paycheck received over the years based on a discriminatory act -- regardless of when the first discrimination occurred -- would extend the statute of limitations 180 days. The current case is Thompson v. North American Stainless, LP (09-291).","Eric Thompson was fired after his fiancée alleged sex discrimination .

"London (CNN) -- Modern European football has become almost synonymous with precocious millionaire players who lead lavish ""bling"" lifestyles and attract wages that would make even Wall Street bankers blush. But there was a time when soccer was a career driven more by love than financial reward. Rewind to 1961 and salaries for even the most famous footballers were low, as the English game was constricted by a law that limited the weekly wage to a maximum of just $31 (£20). It is 50 years since Jimmy Hill -- a dashing midfielder for first division side Fulham and the head of the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) -- won his fight against what he perceived as an ""injustice."" And when he successfully convinced the British Ministry of Labour to scrap the cap, it would change the footballing landscape for ever. His victory saw the English league go on to pioneer an approach that harnessed aggressive global marketing to prompt skyrocketing revenue and, in turn, an explosion in players' wages. Soon after the ruling Hill's team-mate Johnny Haynes became the first ever £100-a-week player. His chairman Tommy Trindle said at the time: ""Johnny Haynes is a top entertainer and will be paid as one from now on."" It was such a large sum that Haynes' pay packet was twice the size of a cabinet minister and was even discussed in the Houses of Parliament. Wages rose steadily through the century but it was the creation of the Premier League in 1992 and the resulting cash boom that prompted an unprecedented spike in salaries. Clubs enjoyed bountiful revenues from lucrative television and sponsorship deals allowing players to cash in. Other leagues in Europe quickly followed suit. The overseas broadcasting rights for 2010-13 alone netted the Premier League $2.2bn, while the winners of the European Champions League, which was also revamped in 1992, can claim up to $46 million. As prize money climbed clubs spent huge amounts chasing success, with most of their income going straight back out on spiraling wages. Nowadays, the English game's highest paid player is said to be Argentina striker Carlos Tevez, who pockets around $450,000-a-week from Manchester City, according to the Daily Mail, while Lionel Messi of Barcelona came top of France Football magazine's 2009 rich list, making $47 million in salary and endorsements. However, despite the game being richer than ever before, more than half of Europe's top clubs recorded a loss in 2009 with some even spending 100% of their income on salaries alone. And even though football proved relatively immune to the recent global downturn, losses are rising, Manchester City posting a $148 million deficit in 2009. But could this era of huge player wages be about to end? The game's European governing body, UEFA, has long been concerned with cash-rich clubs like City, Chelsea and Real Madrid launching huge spending drives to snare a crop of the world's best talent on mega salaries. Now they are seeking to combat a rising sea of debt by introducing new regulations under the banner of ""Financial fair play."" The simple premise is that all European clubs must break even from the start of the 2012-13 season -- and will only be allowed to spend a certain percentage of their profits. Any club falling outside the rules could be expelled from European competitions and cut off from lucrative revenue streams. The Premier League's chief executive has called the rules a ""'soft salary cap"" and is keen to make sure they don't curb the ability to attract the best talent. Richard Scudamore thinks UEFA is ""too sensible"" to follow through on their threat of issuing bans. ""It's more about taking the steam out of the system and acting as a speed bump rather than about barring clubs,"" he said. ""No one in football is proud of the kind of wage inflation we've experienced, but equally we mustn't do anything that dampens the international appeal of our league."" According to Stefan Syzmanski, professor of economics at Cass Business School in London, the plans will not stem the rise and rise of players' wages. He told CNN: ""Often it's put to me that the bubble is about to burst and for 20 years I've been saying 'No, there's no reason for it to burst,' and I still don't see any reason. ""The amount people are willing to pay depends on their income so if you expect economic growth in general to go on increasing I expect wages to generally go on increasing. ""All the money that feeds into football clubs from fans paying to watch the games live or on television or through merchandise, feeds through to players' salaries -- clubs just pass it on."" Even returning Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish has called today's wage levels ""astronomical"" yet he believes most fans don't begrudge players the vast sums they earn. Though previous governments have expressed their concerns at wage levels, any attempt to reintroduce a wage cap, or a higher tax rate for players, would most likely end up in court, Syzmanski says. Despite several clubs sinking into administration very few go out of business and while fans often bemoan the gathering debts at their club, Syzmanski says very few consider the alternative. He said: ""If a football club is making money where would that money go? Well, it's not going to be given back to fans that's for sure. ""I would have thought it's much better to see the fans' money going into buying players, paying wages and throwing the dice because sport is inherently a risky activity, it's a gamble on success. ""Frankly, that's what makes it attractive, so far from actually wanting this kind of merry-go-round to come to an end, actually once clubs cease to take risks we would all find football rather dull and boring."" As for Jimmy Hill, now 82-years-old, his former club Coventry City are still $12,000 short of the $239,000 they need to build a statue of their ex-chairman outside their ground. Perhaps the next time a player like Wayne Rooney agrees a bumper new deal, he should consider making up the shortfall to honor the man who laid the foundations for his path to riches.","Exorbitant wages paid to Europe's top footballers set to keep on soaring .

"(CNN)  -- The Green Bay Packers and Pittsburgh Steelers will contest Super Bowl XLV  after securing narrow victories in the NFC and AFC championship games Sunday night. The Packers beat the Chicago Bears 21-14 to claim the NFC title, with the Steelers joining them in grid-iron's showpiece game with a later 24-19 defeat of the New York Jets to claim the AFC honors. The pair will meet at the Dallas Cowboys Stadium in Texas on Sunday February 6 with the Packers playing their first Super Bowl in 13 years. ""This is a dream come true, incredible feeling. I am at a loss for words,"" Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers told the official NFL website. Rodgers scored a touchdown on the first drive of the game and B.J. Raji later crossed on a 18-yard interception return to put Green Bay 21-7 ahead. Chicago's starting quarterback Jay Cutler struggled to make any impression as he was hampered by a knee injury. Third string Caleb Hanie took up the mantle and set up Chester Taylor for their first touchdown, but it was his mistake that allowed lineman Raji to lumber into the endzone. Hanie then picked out Earl Bennett to cut Green Bay's lead to seven points with nearly five minutes left on the clock, but he was again intercepted and the Packers held on. The Steelers, inspired by quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, later sealed their third visit to the Super Bowl in eight years and eighth overall, but like the Packers had to survive nervous late moments. Rashard Mendenhall, who ran for 121 yards, scored their opening touchdown with Roethlisberger and William Gay also crossing as they built a 24-0 lead. The Jets battled back behind their star quarterback Mark Sanchez, who threw a pair of second half touchdown passes, the latter to Jerricho Cotchery that pulled them to 24-19 with just over three minutes left. But Roethlisberger made sure the Steelers kept their lead as he connected with Heath Miller and Antonio Brown to seal a memorable victory.","Green Bay Packers and Pittsburgh Steelers reach Super Bowl XLV .

"(RollingStone.com)  -- Canada's broadcast regulator, the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission, has put pressure on the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council to reconsider its decision to ban Dire Straits' 1985 hit ""Money for Nothing"" from Canadian airwaves for including an anti-gay slur. The CRTC received more then 250 complaints about the CBSC's decision to remove the song, which is a long-established staple of rock radio stations. Many of the complaints were understandably confused about the distinction between the two organizations: The CRTC is a federal watchdog agency and the CBSC is a non-government industry group set up by private broadcasters to set ethical standards. RollingStone.com: This week in photos . Confusion about the authority of the CBSC has led to uncertainty about how to enforce the ruling among many Canadian radio stations. The CBSC's regional panel had only sanctioned the station in St. John's, Newfoundland where the original complaint about the song originated. The CRTC has sent a letter urging the CBSC to more thoughtfully examine the artistic intent of the Dire Straits tune, taking into account that it has been played countless times over the past 25 years.

"(CNN) -- The brother of a woman who prosecutors say died during complications from an abortion at a Pennsylvania medical clinic hopes the doctor who performed allegedly illegal procedures will never practice again. ""We want justice, this doctor has to be out of that clinic or he should not be treating anybody,"" Damber Ghalley told CNN Monday, referring to his sister, 41-year-old Karnamaya Mongar. ""And the things that happen to my sister, I don't want to happen to anybody in the future."" Dr. Kermit Gosnell is charged with seven first-degree murder charges related to the deaths of seven viable babies, and one third-degree murder in the death of Mongar. He is being held without bail. Mongar died November 20, 2009, after overdosing on anesthetics prescribed by the doctor, Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said. Williams called the facility ""a house of horrors"" that performed ""botched and illegal abortions"" and that was full of containers of fetuses' body parts. Ghalley agreed, telling CNN ""the clinic was so dirty, filthy with blood stains and a dirty floor, everywhere dirty, I cannot describe how dirty it was."" Mongar's family filed a lawsuit last week against Gosnell's practice seeking damages, the family's attorney, Bernard Smalley, said. ""It's unforgettable, my sister will never come back and it's sad,"" Ghalley said. ""All the happiness is gone, they miss their mother every day and night,"" Ghalley said, referring to Mongar's four children. Born in Bhutan, Mongar spent 18 years living in a bamboo hut in a Nepalese refugee camp before coming to the United States in July 2009 as part of a humanitarian resettlement program, Smalley said. The mother of four and grandmother of one was 19 weeks into her pregnancy when, after getting a referral from a Washington, D.C., medical clinic, she went to Gosnell's practice. There, Smalley said, ""an unlicensed high school student"" -- who got instructions from Gosnell over a cell phone -- gave the woman anesthesia, and there was no equipment to resuscitate her once things went wrong. ""These children have to grow up without their mother, you have a husband who is going to have to go on without his wife,"" Smalley said of Mongar's family. ""There will be justice at the end of the day, but at what price? They've lost a loved one who can never come back."" Gosnell is next scheduled to appear in court on February 9.","Philadelphia doctor Kermit Gosnell is being held on eight murder charges .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The wisdom of business professors, once only available to MBAs and business students, can now be accessed by anybody with an Internet connection. At HEC Paris, MBA students are given an iPod Touch so they can download podcasts of lectures. Hundreds of universities, and a growing number of business schools, are making recordings of lectures, seminars and conferences available to the general public via Web sites such as iTunes and YouTube. Leading business schools including University of Cambridge Judge Business School, Fuqua School of Business, and Yale School of Management make course content available for download through iTunes University (iTunes U), part of the of the iTunes online store. That means those whose budget won't stretch to a two-year MBA can simulate the experience at home -- or at work, in the gym or anywhere else they choose. And even better for money-conscious learners, the iTunes U content can all be downloaded free of charge. French business school HEC Paris is due to launch its iTunes U content in the next few months, but it has been running an ambitious podcast program since 2006. Begun as an experiment in partnership with Apple, all new MBAs at HEC are provided with an iPod Touch. Around half of the MBA lectures are filmed using an automatic camera system and the footage is made available for students to download and view on their iPhones. Vanessa Klein, HEC's project manager for iTunes U, told CNN that the iPod-enabled curriculum has proved a hit with students. As well watching lectures, she said the students' own presentations are recorded and made available for download so they can review their performance. She says one teacher noticed that each year his MBA students would ask the same questions after his end-of-course summary, so he made a podcast of recurring questions and answers. After encouraging students to come up with new questions, he is now recording responses to those in an effort to compile a video archive of questions and answers. Read more business features . Klein says that by making lectures available via iTunes U, HEC wants to be at the forefront of providing content for the rest of the world, but she acknowledges that the technology is also a great way to promote the business school. ""It's a good marketing tool, not as publicity but to really show people what we are providing,"" she told CNN. ""You can watch a lecture, learn a lot and think 'I wish I could be there.' The idea is to show what you could learn if you were at this place."" YouTube EDU was launched in March this year and hosts the YouTube channels of hundreds of universities. Earlier this month it added content from 45 universities in Europe and Israel and now holds videos of lectures and discussions provided by business schools including INSEAD, ESCP Europe and University of California Haas School of Business. Launched at the same time as YouTube EDU, Academic Earth hosts videos from U.S. universities including Harvard, Yale and Princeton, although the business content is provided almost exclusively by Stanford University. Offering less audio/visual content, but still full of business school information, MIT's Open Course Ware site gives free access to almost all MIT course content, including extensive lecture notes, assignments and exams from MIT's Sloan School of Management. Interested in the ""Advanced Topics in Real Estate Finance?"" You can download the complete lecture notes from Sloan's 2007 course on the subject at MIT's Open Course Ware site. Other universities have their own Open Course Ware sites and the Open Course Ware Consortium has been set up as an agglomerator site, providing content from more over 200 higher education institutions. But it's iTunes U that's generating the most interest. The University of Oxford says there have been more than one million downloads from its iTunes U site, while Stanford University says its course on creating iPhone applications was downloaded more than one million times in just seven weeks. This week's most popular business download on iTunes U is a University of Oxford lecture called ""Entrepreneurship and the Ideal Business Plan."" It may not get as many downloads as Michael Jackson's posthumous single, but it should prove more useful when it comes to getting a business off the ground.","A growing number of business schools are putting lectures on the Internet .

"(CNN)  -- The news was devastating, the aftermath surreal. Somer Thompson, 7, went missing Monday on her way home from school. Diena Thompson clutched a tissue in her right hand, frequently wiping her eyes as she told reporters that she couldn't believe it was her daughter whose body was found in a Georgia landfill. Her visage revealed the weight of grief and a yearning for justice. Standing outside her home in Orange Park, Florida, Thompson looked into the camera and, with her voice cracking, sent out a stern warning to her daughter's killer. ""I want you to know that I will not sleep until this person is found. I hope they get you and I hope they make you pay for a long, long time. You don't take from somebody. You didn't just take her from me. You took her from my family, you took her from all these people. And you don't do this to a little baby and put my baby in the trash like she's nothing. That's not OK, this is not OK.""  Watch Thompson warn her daughter's killer » . The body of her daughter, 7-year-old Somer Thompson, was found in a south Georgia landfill, Clay County, Florida, Sheriff Rick Beseler said Thursday morning. Authorities on Friday were combing were through a ""tremendous mountain"" of garbage at the landfill, a sheriff's spokeswoman said. Some possible evidence has been removed from the landfill, but authorities won't describe what they found, said Mary Justino of the Clay County Sheriff's Department. Police have no suspects, she said. She said other law enforcement teams are focusing on the locale where the child apparently was last seen. Justino said witnesses, including some children, saw her on the sidewalk in front of a vacant house that is being renovated after a fire. ""Since Monday, we have been trying to figure out who frequents that area,"" including anyone working on the home, she said. Authorities are treating the death as a homicide. Somer became separated from her siblings and schoolmates on her way home from school in Orange Park, Florida, on Monday. She was seen in a fight at school before she disappeared, according to a police report released Thursday. Her 10-year-old sister told police that Somer had gotten into a fight with another girl at school earlier in the day. The sister said she brought up the fight while she and her brother walked Somer home from school, and that Somer ran off from them, apparently upset. The sister said she lost sight of Somer in a group of other kids leaving the school, according to the police report. The medical examiner in Savannah, Georgia, used dental records to positively identify the body as Somer's, said Clay County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Mary Justino. Authorities now are turning their full attention to finding the child's killer. Beseler held up a map dotted with markers as he said on CNN's ""American Morning"" that detectives have questioned more than 70 registered sex offenders or predators living within five square miles of Somer's home. The landfill where her body was found is near Folkston, Georgia, 55 miles north of where the girl became separated from her schoolmates on her way home from school in Orange Park on Monday. The sheriff told the girl's mother Wednesday night that her daughter had been identified. Thompson, he said, was devastated. ""It was the hardest phone call I've ever had to make in my life, and I hope I never have to make another one like that,"" Beseler said at a Thursday morning news conference.  Watch sheriff announce that girl's body identified » . Authorities will work to pinpoint where the garbage load that contained the girl's body came from, Beseler said. The garbage that was brought into that part of the landfill was collected in the Orange Park area, he had said Wednesday, noting that authorities routinely search garbage when a missing person case has been initiated. The investigation has now turned into a murder probe. ""There is a child killer on the loose,"" the sheriff said. ""I fear for our community until we bring this person in.""

"(CNN) -- John P. Wheeler III, a former Pentagon official and the first chairman of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund, ""died as a result of blunt force trauma after being assaulted,"" the Delaware medical examiner's office said Friday. A toxicology analysis also was done during the autopsy, but the results were not released. Police are still trying to determine who committed the crime. ""We don't know, ultimately, who was responsible for his death,"" said Lt. Mark Farrall spokesman for the Newark, Delaware, Police Department. Wheeler's body was discovered New Year's Eve at Wilmington's Cherry Island landfill as a sanitation truck was unloading garbage it had picked up from metal trash bins in Newark. Police say Wheeler was last seen in Wilmington at 8:42 p.m. on December 30, captured by a surveillance camera. He appeared confused on video surveillance tape that showed him near the Nemours Building in Wilmington. ""We don't know how he got to Newark,"" said Farrall. ""We're still canvassing the area, conducting interviews, checking video surveillance."" A Wilmington parking lot attendant, Iman Goldsborough, noted Wheeler's strange appearance on December 29 when he stumbled into her garage. ""It striked me as being odd because he had one shoe in his hand and no coat on,"" said Goldsborough. Wheeler, 66, oversaw fundraising to construct the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. He worked in the administrations of Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush. From 2005 to 2008, he was a special assistant to the secretary of the Air Force. At the time of his death, Wheeler was working as a part-time consultant for the MITRE Corp., a not-for-profit organization that provides systems engineering, research and development and information technology support to the federal government.","Former Pentagon official died of blunt force trauma, according to autopsy .

"(CNN) -- A federal scuba-diving team conducting a training dive in a Miami canal last week made a grisly discovery -- a human skull, authorities said Tuesday. The team was conducting routine training January 5 in the Palmetto Bay area when a diver discovered the skull in about 15 to 20 feet of water, said Nicole Navas, a spokeswoman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. An initial assessment by the Miami-Dade Police Department determined the skull probably belonged to a black male, 25 to 45 years old, Navas said. The time and cause of death could not immediately be determined. The Miami-Dade medical examiner's office took custody of the skull for investigation. A spokesman for the medical examiner said that in addition to looking for evidence of homicide, suicide, accidental death or natural death, his examiners also will consult with a local expert on Afro-Caribbean religions. ""Periodically, human skulls found in our jurisdiction are traced to Santeria or Palo Mayombe source,"" said spokesman Larry Cameron. Published accounts say adherents of those religions have disinterred remains for religious rituals, and Cameron said customs officials at airport ports of entry sometimes discover skulls being brought in for that purpose. ""In many of these cases identification is never made, and thus the skulls find a permanent home in our anthropology room,"" he said. But, he said, ""at this point we have not proceeded real far with our investigation,"" and no possibility has been eliminated. The discovery was disclosed Tuesday in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement news release summarizing the activities of the ICE Miami Tactical Dive Team, which assists in providing security on Florida waterways, aids in drug interdiction efforts and helps conduct underwater searches.","The skull was found during a training exercise in a Miami canal .

"(CNN) -- As mass protests swept Egypt on Friday, the actions of two key institutions served as indicators for what lies ahead for the embattled regime: the military and the media. President Hosni Mubarak deployed the Egyptian army for the first time to the streets to quell angry demonstrations against his authoritarian regime. That's a sure sign of the government's desperation, according to experts on the region. And for the first time, the state-run media didn't ignore the unrest or dump on the demonstrations as acts of terrorism in its usual manner. That, too, say experts, was a key indicator that Mubarak could be facing trouble. It's a given that the military, a pillar of Egyptian authority since a 1952 coup toppled the monarchy, holds the keys at this critical juncture. Many feared that the army will silence the protesters with its firepower and tanks that are now out on the streets of Cairo and Alexandria. But Edward Walker, a former U.S. ambassador to Egypt, said that a military crackdown would be a ""death knell not only to the military but the regime."" Such a crackdown didn't happen in nearby Tunisia, where the authoritarian ruler fled the nation, and it was hardly what happened in Egypt on Friday. On the contrary, Egypt's 450,000-strong armed forces are well-established and respected by the people. Journalists reported seeing protesters cheer army convoys as they drove into Cairo and Alexandria. Some embraced the soldiers on the ground; they were seen as saviors from excessive police brutality. To Mohammed el-Nawawy, a professor at Queens University in North Carolina, the fact that the military was called out Friday showed that Mubarak was desperate. The all-important question is how loyal the armed forces will remain to the aging leader who has ruled Egypt with an iron fist for three decades. Meanwhile, the state-controlled television network walked a tightrope Friday. Early in the day, Nile TV began showing footage of the demonstrations of ""tens of thousands of people"" and reported the use of police tear gas. It aired opposition leaders criticizing the government for shutting down the lines of communication. Shawn Powers, a Georgia State University assistant professor who studies international media, said it was unusual for an arm of the government to even cover these events or portray them as anything but acts initiated by unsavory elements of society. ""I'm amazed,"" Powers said of the coverage. Even with social media and mobile phone messaging blocked, Egyptians could see events unfolding live on international networks including CNN. The Egyptian media may have felt that they would lose all credibility with the people if they were to completely distort the story. Ultimately, Powers said, he suspected fissures within Mubarak's ranks and said some in the government may be thinking of their own future in a nation barely holding back from the brink. ""What we're seeing today is parts of the government feeling increasingly isolated from Mubarak or intentionally doing so to hold on to power after Mubarak goes,"" he said. By the end of the day, however, Nile TV's coverage shifted, reverting to words like ""hooliganism"" and ""lawlessness"" to describe the demonstrations. El-Nawawy, who has studied Egyptian media in depth, said Friday's media coverage could mean that Mubarak has no one left to blame, so he gave the protesters, many of whom are young people, a little wiggle room. ""The state media is walking a fine line to give credit to the young people, but in the meantime, it has to justify intervention and crackdown,"" el-Nawawy said. El-Nawawy said things will get really thorny if Egypt's impoverished masses join hands with the protesters -- believed to be largely from the educated middle classes -- and the demonstrations grow to even more chaotic proportions.

"(CNN) -- A statement purportedly released by a violent Mexican drug cartel promises a one-month extension to a truce it called for in December. The Familia Michoacana cartel, which takes its name from the central-coastal state where it operates, signed the statement, which was circulated by e-mail on Sunday and published in its entirety on a blog dedicated to covering the drug wars. Mexican authorities were not immediately available to comment on the authenticity of the communication. The cartel accuses the federal police of committing abuses in the region and blaming them. The authorities have attacked the cartel and any person caught in its path, be it civilians, women or children, the cartel alleges. It also wishes the residents of Michoacan a happy new year. The Familia Michoacana ""separates itself from any criminal act that occurred in the month of December 2010 that the federal authorities want to make us responsible for,"" the statement says. A similar letter circulated last month offered a truce for the month of December, though that didn't mean the the month was without violence. The Mexican government continued its operations against the cartel, killing one of its leaders, Nazario Moreno Gonzalez, after two days of armed confrontations. Five federal police officers and three civilians, including two minors, were killed in the operation, a national security spokesman said at the time. Three members of La Familia Michoacana were killed and three others captured. Authorities described a scene of heavy gunfire where cartel members set trucks and buses on fire on highways to block police from arriving. Another cartel leader, Francisco Lopez Villanueva, alias ""El Bigote,"" was captured at the end of the month. The truce will be extended another month ""to continue demonstrating to the authorities, federal government and above all the Michoacan residents that the Familia Michoacana is not guilty of all of the criminal acts that the authorities and federal government make public through the media,"" the statement says.","The Familia Michoacana is one of the most violence cartels in Mexico .

"(CNN) -- The question may have been lost in translation, but a visibly angry Secretary of State Hillary Clinton bluntly told a town-hall meeting in the Democratic Republic of Congo on Monday, ""I will you tell you my opinion, I'm not going to channel my husband."" Hillary Clinton became visibly angry after a translator asked what Bill Clinton would think regarding an issue. The unscripted moment happened as Clinton spoke to students at a Congolese university in Kinshasa, the Congo capital. A male student rose to ask a question about Chinese financial contracts with Congo. The student asked Clinton what President Obama would think of the deal, but pool reporters in the room said the translator made a mistake, posing the question as what would Bill Clinton think. Clinton looked surprised when she first heard the translation in the headset, and then sharply replied, ""You want me to tell you what my husband thinks? My husband is not the secretary of state, I am. You ask my opinion. I will tell you my opinion; I'm not going to channel my husband.""  Watch Clinton react to question » . At the State Department, Assistant Secretary P.J. Crowley said the question she heard ""struck a nerve,"" that her opinion on the matter was apparently of less interest than that of her husband, the former president. Crowley told CNN that Clinton's answer must be considered in the context of her African trip. ""The secretary of state is going to Goma Tuesday, to draw attention to the plight of women who are victims of rape as a weapon of war"" in Congo, Crowley said. ""She did react to what she heard,"" Crowley explained, but regardless that the interpreter may have gotten it wrong, ""you can't separate the question from the setting."" He said ""If Africa, if Congo is going to advance, women have to play a more significant role. She was in the setting of a town hall, and the questioner was interested in what two men thought, not the secretary of state."" Crowley, who has just returned to Washington after traveling with Clinton during the first part of her trip to Africa, said the State Department has not yet reviewed recordings of the original question, in French, to learn whether the student clearly intended the question to refer to Obama, not former President Clinton. ""She did talk with the student afterward, and they seemed to have reached an understanding,"" Crowley said.","Question at town-hall meeting may have been an error of translation .

"(CNN) -- Occupants of three trucks were working together in northern Mexico trying to pull over a vehicle carrying an American missionary before one of them shot the woman in the head, police said Thursday. An autopsy detailed Thursday indicated that Nancy Davis, 59, died a day earlier from a single gunshot wound to the back of her head, according to a statement from Pharr, Texas, Police Chief Ruben Villescas, who is working with U.S. and Mexican authorities on the case. Earlier, police said that Davis and her husband were traveling in a truck on a Mexican highway near the city of San Fernando, Mexico, when they were confronted by gunmen in a black pickup. San Fernando is south of the border city of Reynosa in Tamaulipas state. On Thursday, Villescas added that the husband -- identified as Sam Davis by family friends -- told authorities ""the men in the black truck were working with two light-colored trucks that paralleled them (and were) trying to pull them over,"" the Pharr police statement said. ""The gunmen were attempting to stop them and the victims accelerated in efforts of getting away from them,"" according to the earlier statement. ""At a certain point the gunmen discharged a weapon at the victim's vehicle and a bullet struck the victim Nancy Shuman Davis on the head."" While noting they have not established a motive in this shooting, police pointed to past reports of ""criminal organizations operating on Mexican roads ... targeting 4-door pickup trucks and ... SUVs."" Villescas said that authorities don't know which criminal group, if any, is responsible for Davis' murder. In Wednesday's incident, at least one other gunshot hit the victim's vehicle, which is now in the custody of Pharr police. After Davis was hit, her husband drove their truck ""at high rate of speed"" to the Pharr International Bridge, which crosses the Rio Grande. Nancy Davis was taken to a hospital in nearby McAllen, where she was pronounced dead about 90 minutes later. The Texas Department of Public Safety, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the FBI and U.S. Customs and Border Protection are also assisting, police said. The Mexican Interior Ministry said it, too, was investigating ""for the purpose of clarifying the facts and act accordingly to punish the person or persons responsible."" Merton Rundell, a professor in the missions department at Indiana's Union Bible College & Academy and a family friend, told CNN the couple had lived in Mexico since the 1970s and worked with the Gospel Proclaimers mission in Mexico. Maryanne Wheeler, another friend who worked with the Davises in the 1990s, said Nancy Davis' death was a great loss. ""They breathed Mexico,"" Wheeler said. ""That's their love. ""For 40 years she has gone around Mexico, trying to be there as a nurse, a friend, as a spiritual adviser and has loved them. They lost the best,"" she said. ""They had a petite lady who had the tenacity of a bulldog and was there for you."" Wheeler said the couple had been shot at before and knew the dangers of the border area.

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- Even though they were stuck without air conditioning, hot showers and decent meals, some of the passengers who made it off a crippled Carnival Cruise Lines ship said Friday that they would go on a cruise again. ""I'm so thankful that we're all alive,"" Leticia Lewis said on CNN's ""American Morning."" ""I don't wish this experience on anyone. It wasn't a wonderful event. But I would take another one."" Amber Haslerud, another passenger, said her voyage on the ill-fated Carnival Cruise ship Splendor was her first cruise, and she would also go on another one. ""I definitely would give it another go and try to get the experience I should have had this time,"" said Haslerud. ""I deserve it after all that we went through this week."" The ship and its approximately 3,300 passengers arrived in San Diego on Thursday, four days after a fire in the engine room left the ship without air conditioning, hot showers or refrigeration one day into a scheduled seven-day cruise along the Mexican coast. ""It was absolutely deplorable,"" passenger Marquis Horace said. At one point, the ship ran out of food, he said, and ""they started making mayo sandwiches."" Passengers said they weren't told there was a fire until they left the ship. Horace said the crew informed passengers only of ""a flameless fire."" Carnival spokeswoman Jennifer de la Cruz said officials initially spoke only of smoke because the crew couldn't get into the engine room to assess the situation. Passengers were advised of the fire once it was confirmed, she said. Maritime law doesn't require cruise lines to tell passengers about onboard problems, said Robert Jarvis, a professor of law at Nova Southern University in Fort Lauderdale, Flordia. He said it sometimes makes sense to limit or delay the release of information to avoid a panic. Carnival's position is to inform passengers any time an issue will affect their cruise, de la Cruz said. The cruise line has said it plans to give customers who were aboard the Splendor a full refund, reimbursement for travel costs and a free cruise. Natalie Martinez and Angela Evans are among those who said they would also go on another cruise. But they said they would bring a survival kit with flashlights, chocolate and air freshener. And ""I think we would wait a year,"" Martinez added.. Some passengers aren't sure if they'll cruise again. Maurice Harold and his wife, Cynthia Harold, not only had to endure being adrift, they had to do so without some of their own clothes, medicines and other items lost when their luggage went into the water while being loaded onto the ship. ""It was pretty traumatic. It was a scary situation, said Cynthia Harold, who said she needs to use an oxygen machine while sleeping and was unable to after the ship lost power. ""I really haven't slept since I left Virginia Beach,"" she said. The couple said they were unsure of their next steps, adding that it all depends on how Carnival compensates them. Others looked at the incident differently calling it an ""adventure."" ""A lot of things went wrong, but it was really fun,"" said one young passenger, Ryan Harlan, who was traveling with his parents. ""We went to the Kids' Camp."" He said the Kids' Camp was, in fact, his favorite part, because he made some friends. And the worst part? ""Being stranded in the middle of the ocean,"" he said. The National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday it was investigating the incident. But later in the day the safety board said officials from Panama would lead the investigation because that is the country the vessel is flagged under. The U.S. Coast  Guard will also be part of the investigation, the transportation board said.","NEW: Maritime law gives crew discretion on informing passengers of problems .

"Colombo, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- United States became the second country to offer emergency assistance to more than a million affected by flooding in Sri Lanka. U.S. ambassador to the country, Patricia A. Butenis, said in a statement that Washington was donating U.S. $300,000 to provide various goods and services to areas hardest-hit by the floods. She said the funds have provided boats to local government in the eastern district of Batticaloa. ""We are helping the government to identify families in need and make an accurate assessment of the situation,"" she said. On Friday, an Indian air force aircraft brought in 34 tons of relief supplies. They included food, medical supplies, clothing and sleeping gear. Another shipment will arrive on Monday, an Indian high commission official said. The Sri Lanka government has about $1.3 million of assistance funds so far for the flood victims. Though the rains have diminished or receded in most areas, disaster center officials in Colombo warned that the dangers were not yet over. The Sri Lanka branch of the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said that floods and receding waters may unearth mines and explosive remnants of war (ERW) "" and carry explosives from contaminated areas into areas thought to be safe."" Mine officials and local authorities have urged vigilance from residents and people working in affected areas. The army has also sent out instructions to their installations in affected areas to warn the public, Maj. Gen. Udaya Madawala said. The mines are remnants of a war between Sri Lankan security forces and the Tamil Tiger rebels. Sri Lankan troops defeated the rebels in May 2009. The OCHA report said that the worst affected districts were Ampara, Batticaloa and Trincomalee in the eastern province. Initial estimates indicate that more than 250,000 acres of crop land and 200,000 acres of paddy have been severely damaged. OCHA warned that prices of rice and other commodities may increase as one of the most productive paddy areas of the country have been affected. The number of camps for displaced people has gone up to 600 camp, according to disaster officials.","U.S. one of two countries helping those affected by floods in Sri Lanka .

"Juba, Sudan (CNN) -- Sudan's foreign affairs ministry is contradicting U.S. President Jimmy Carter's statement about Southern Sudan's debt obligations. Southern Sudanese voters are heading to the polls this week to determine whether they should secede from Sudan. The question of how to split Sudan's debt is one of several issues that would have to be resolved if the south votes for independence, as is widely expected. On Monday, Carter told CNN that Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir ""said the entire debt should be assigned to north Sudan and not to the southern part of Sudan. So, in effect, Southern Sudan is starting with a clean sheet on debt. They'll have to make some arrangements for other sources of income, of course."" The Sudan News Agency reported Monday the country's foreign affairs ministry ""categorically refuted the statements."" It said the ministry's spokesman, Khalid Musa, explained that during the Carter meeting, al-Bashir affirmed Sudan's strong call on the international community to take the initiative in writing off Sudan's debts as part of the Debt Relief for Developing Countries and the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative ""in a view that the country, both in the north and south, have not enough resources to pay these debts."" Musa also noted the expected decrease of the north's oil revenues if southerners choose separation, the news agency said. According to Musa, al-Bashir said debt is a joint responsibility of the north and the south ""under joint negotiations of the two partners,"" the news agency said. A representative for The Carter Center who is in Sudan did not release an official response when reached by phone Tuesday. In a piece written by Carter that appears on CNN.com, the 39th U.S. president said ""the United States should resume normal relations with the government in Khartoum and support debt relief for the governments in both the North and South"" if the referendum succeeds. ""In addition to the loss of one-third of its geographic area, the economic cost to the North of losing a large share of current oil revenues will hurt the economy significantly,"" Carter added. Meanwhile, voters in Southern Sudan participated Tuesday in the third day of the week-long referendum. The south would become a new nation in July if voters choose independence and no other obstacles emerge. The referendum was called for in the 2005 peace treaty that ended 22 years of war between a government dominated by Arab Muslims in the north and black Christians and animists in the south. That war killed at least 2 million. South Sudanese vote, celebrate in Australia . At one polling station in Lologo, on the outskirts of the southern capital of Juba, some people slept nearby or arrived early Monday. The reason: So many voters had showed up on Sunday that some were turned away. Mary Luluwa shuffled to the front of the line with her wooden cane. Nearly blind, she had to be shown by election officials how to place her thumbprint. Luluwa said she was not sure . old she is, but she said she is certain how she will vote. ""For freedom,"" she said. ""I am very happy to vote, it's my first time, I am old and I can't see much, but I voted for my children."" But Tuesday's voting follows several days of violence that flared up in a disputed region between north and south. At least 23 people have been killed in ongoing clashes around the disputed region of Abyei, an oil-rich area that the British transferred to Sudan in 1905. A 2005 peace agreement called for people in Abyei to vote this week on whether to remain part of the north or return to the south, but that vote has been delayed. Clashes have erupted for four days between members of the Ngok Dinka ethnic group, which tend to have more in common with the south, and the Misseriya, a nomadic Arabic tribe that comes in and out of the Abyei region and whose sympathies would most likely tilt toward the northern government. Thirteen of the 23 were Misseriya, according to hospital officials in nearby Muglad. Ten were reported dead in Abyei, said John Ajang, secretary general of the Abyei government. Ajang said Monday that he believes the armed militias that clashed with Abyei government forces were not Misseriya tribesmen, but rather Sudanese government-supported militias. He said witnesses described heavy weaponry inconsistent with the automatic weaponry seen carried by Misseriya tribesmen in the past. ""We believe this is an attempt by the Sudanese government to take Abyei while the government of south Sudan forces are busy with the referendum,"" Ajang said. Observers from around the world are monitoring the historic referendum. The Atlanta-based Carter Center has about 70 observers in Sudan and 30 observers in eight other countries where Southern Sudanese are living and voting, according to David Carroll, director of the Democracy Program at The Carter Center. Representatives of the European Union, the African Union, the Arab League and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development are also observing the referendum. Southern Sudanese people who lived in the north for decades have crossed back into their homeland to vote in the referendum. Meanwhile, some voters in the north said they voted for unity, including one woman who said she didn't see a point in splitting up the country. Prior to the voting, Southern Sudanese diplomat John Duku said a unified Sudanese nation ""means only one thing -- it means war."" ""Over the years, unity has imposed war on us, the unity has imposed marginalization on us, the unity has imposed slavery on us,"" he said. ""So, what is the meaning of unity? For the people of south Sudan, it means only war."" The south has repeatedly accused the north of trying to stoke tension by supporting rebels troops to destabilize the south, an allegation the Arab Muslim-led government in Khartoum denies. Even with a secession vote, stumbling blocks could remain -- about 20% of the border area has not been demarcated, and the division of oil revenues between the two sides could be an issue. CNN's David McKenzie and Ingrid Formanek contributed to this report from Juba, Sudan; CNN's Ben Wedeman from Khartoum, Sudan and Journalist Nima Elbagir from Balom, Sudan.","Southern Sudanese are voting on whether to separate from Sudan .

"(CNN) -- Thailand pulled back from the brink of chaos this week as anti-government protesters ended their occupation of Bangkok's two main airports after a court ousted Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat. Protesters say the current Thai government is a proxy for exiled former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. But political reshuffling means that the current crisis, merely the latest episode in an ongoing political saga that has undermined the stability of the southeast Asian nation, is set to continue. What's the background to Thailand's political crisis? The latest unrest, which has seen anti-government protesters occupy Bangkok's international airport, dates back to the controversial premiership of Thaksin Shinawatra. A multibillionaire media tycoon, Thaksin was elected in 2001 on a populist platform that promised universal healthcare and cash handouts to poor villagers. But Thaksin's government was soon mired in allegations of corruption and he prompted anger by selling control of his Shin Corp. media group to Singaporean investors. Throughout the summer of 2006 hundreds of thousands of protesters took to the street to demand Thaksin's resignation, prompting the army to oust him in a bloodless coup. But subsequent governments have been seen as proxies for Thaksin. Somchai Wongsawat, who took charge in September, is his brother-in-law. Somchai's predecessor, Samak Sundaravej, who was forced to step down in August after Thailand's Supreme Court ruled he had violated the constitution by appearing on a TV cookery show, was also an avowed Thaksin ally. ""Basically since 2006 the protesters have been grappling with the problem that whoever the people elect is a supporter of Thaksin,"" said CNN's Bangkok Correspondent Dan Rivers. ""They held an election and, having banned his old party, it re-emerged under a different name and won the election. The underlying issues are exactly the same."" Who are the protesters? The anti-government People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) was founded in 2005 by Sondhi Limthongkul; like Thaksin, Sondhi is a successful media mogul and a former supporter of the exiled former PM. The group claims to represent the traditional Bangkok ruling class and argues that lawmakers should be mostly appointed rather than elected. During 2006's anti-Thaksin protests, PAD rallies attracted massive crowds but numbers have dwindled significantly, according to Rivers. Since August, PAD supporters have occupied Government House, the Thai prime minister's main offices, in what they have called their ""final battle"" against the government.  The Bangkok protests in pictures » . ""As time goes on the PAD seems to be getting more and more desperate,"" said Rivers. ""They have irritated people with months and months of standoffs. A lot of the media has turned against them. There are fewer and fewer people who support what they are doing because they see that they are ruining the fragile democracy that there was here.""  Watch what's behind protesters' demands » . What role has Thaksin played in the crisis? Thaksin is currently living in exile in Dubai, having been convicted in October by the Thai Supreme Court to two years in prison on a corruption charge. However he continued to wield power through Somchai and his political allies, Rivers said: ""There is no doubt he is the puppetmaster behind this government. This is a battle between Thaksin and his opponents, as it has been all the way along. He came out this week and said he wants to come back and be prime minister one day which is a big thing for him because before he said he was through with politics."" So is it all over? The protesters ended their siege early Wednesday after the Constitutional Court dissolved Somchai ruling party, effectively ousting his government from office. The court found the People Power Party committed electoral fraud, and it barred Somchai and other top party officials from from holding public office for five years. Some flight have resumed after a week of disruption and stranded tourists were beginning to leave. But within hours of the courty's ruling, PPP members unaffected by the ban regrouped under the banner of the Puea Thai party, a move that will allow them to maintain their grip on power and could potentially trigger new protests. Rivers said the court's ruling was little more than a face-saving resolution for the airport protesters, who became increasingly desperate and isolated as Thais grew tired of the blockade. He said the move would change little. ""This is merely the interval between acts -- the PAD protest show and the Thaksin puppetry are about to start all over again,"" he said.","Thailand's political crisis dates back to protests against Thaksin Shinawatra in 2006 .

"(CNN) -- The Nepalese government has reached a deal to help reinforce peace after the United Nations ends its mandate in the nation early Sunday morning. The U.N. mission in Nepal was set up four years ago to push for peace following a decade-long conflict between Maoist insurgents and state forces. At least 13,000 people died in the violence, the United Nations said in a statement. ""I congratulate the government and the Unified Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist for agreeing on arms monitoring arrangements, which are so crucial to reinforcing confidence in the peace process,"" said Karin Landgren, U.N. envoy to Nepal. ""I hope the parties will build on this to implement the long-awaited integration and rehabilitation of the Maoist army personnel."" The U.N. said in a statement that its mandate included monitoring arms and armed personnel to the Nepal and Maoist armies. Reintegration of former Maoist rebels into the Nepal army or the police was left up to the parties involved, the United Nations said. The U.N.

"LAGOS, Nigeria (CNN)  -- A Nigerian militant group claimed Wednesday it sabotaged oil pipelines in the country's oil-rich southern Niger Delta, but the country's military denies the assertion. File image of armed MEND militants in Niger Delta region of Nigeria . The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) said in an e-mail message to reporters that the ""major Shell and Agip crude trunk lines in Bayelsa state"" were struck. ""The Agip pipeline which connects the Agip Brass terminal was sabotaged at Nembe creek while the Shell Nembe creek line was done at Asawo village,"" MEND said. Shell said it is investigating reports of an attack on the Nembe creek pipeline and Agip could not be reached for comment. Rabe Abubakar, spokesman for the Nigerian military's Joint Task Force, said ""the militants are telling lies"" and ""there is no iota of truth in what they are saying."" Their claims against the Shell pipeline ""are not true,"" Abubakar said, explaining that explosives were hurled at the pipeline but the explosion was limited and it did not destroy the line. ""There was an attempt by them to blow up an Agip pipeline around 3 a.m., but the soldiers protected the place and the militants fled,"" Abubakar said. Explosives were found on a well and an explosives expert was brought in to remove them, he added. MEND -- which has declared an ""all-out war"" on the government -- demands that more of Nigeria's oil wealth be reinvested in the region, instead of enriching those whom the militants consider corrupt politicians. But fighting has continued despite Nigerian President Umaru Yar'Adua's recent call for an amnesty for the militant groups, an offer that stays open until October 4. Under the amnesty proposal, militants must hand in their weapons and take part in government rehabilitation programs. Also on Wednesday, the military said three people were seized for trying to blow up a pipeline at the Forcados River. But MEND said the military ""arrested two repentant armed youths who approached them to take advantage of the government's amnesty offer."" ""We are learning that there are about 11 of such cases currently languishing in detention inside the JTF headquarters in Warri,"" MEND said. Last month, Amnesty International said that pollution and other environmental impacts from the oil industry in the Niger Delta are creating a ""human rights tragedy"" in which local people suffer poor health and loss of livelihood. Governments and oil companies are failing to be accountable for the problems, Amnesty said in its report, called ""Petroleum, Pollution and Poverty in the Niger Delta."" Covering 46,500 square miles (75,000 square km), the Niger Delta is about the same size as the Czech Republic, according to the United Nations Development Programme. An area of rich biological diversity, the region contains the world's third-largest wetland with the most extensive freshwater swamp forest, according to the UNDP. More than half the area contains creeks and small islands, while the rest is rain forest, the UNDP says. At the same time, the Niger Delta produces the oil wealth that accounts for the bulk of Nigeria's foreign earnings, the UNDP says. Earlier this week, MEND said its fighters had blown up an oil pipeline and captured six crew members of a chemical tanker. MEND is now saying it has released the ship and the military says it secured the vessel. It is not clear whether the three Russians, two Filipinos and the Indian seized remain in custody. MEND told CNN that ""to their knowledge,"" the crew is no longer being held hostage.

"Abidjan, Ivory Coast (CNN) -- Violence in Ivory Coast was ongoing amid a tense political standoff Wednesday, after at least five police officers were killed and three U.N. peacekeepers were wounded in an Abidjan neighborhood, and three other police officers were killed in clashes with protesters, officials said. The five police officers were killed Tuesday night by heavily armed gunmen in what authorities said was a targeted attack in the densely populated Abobo area of the city, a police source said Wednesday. The three U.N. peacekeepers sustained minor injuries overnight when they ""came under crossfire from both sides of the road"" while returning from a patrol, the U.N. operation in Ivory Coast said in a statement Wednesday. The U.N. forces -- a joint team of military and U.N. police -- were forced to return fire, the operation said. Five other people were killed earlier Tuesday in clashes between police and supporters of the nation's president-elect amid an ongoing political standoff in the West African nation, an official said. The dead included three police officers and two demonstrators, the governor of Abidjan said Tuesday. The deaths came a day after the U.N. Security Council condemned the violence that has erupted since the country's November 28 presidential runoff election and ""urged all parties to exercise restraint."" The incidents came a day after forces belonging to self-declared President Laurent Gbagbo blocked and looted a food convoy, the operation said, adding it ""reiterates its call for calm and urges all parties concerned to avoid recourse to violence."" Amnesty International issued a statement warning of a fresh outbreak of violence in the wake of the five officers' deaths, which it said happened early Wednesday. ""Some of the worst armed clashes so far broke out in the city of Abidjan today,"" the organization said. An unidentified witness told Amnesty International of having heard ""heavy exchanges of fire"" around midnight and seeing Wednesday morning ""three military vehicles burnt out"" and the body of a member of the security forces, the statement said. State-run RTI reported the government has imposed a curfew on the Abobo and Ayaman neighborhoods of Abidjan, where the violence occurred. The curfew is in place from Wednesday until 6 a.m. Saturday, it said. The cocoa-producing nation was plunged into crisis when Alassane Ouattara was declared the winner of the election, but the incumbent, Gbagbo, refused to leave office. The Security Council expressed its support for efforts by the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States in pursuing a peaceful resolution of the crisis. At the same time, the council repeated its readiness to impose measures -- including sanctions -- against those who threaten the peace process by blocking the work of the U.N. mission and others or ""commit serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law."" Meanwhile, Ouattara is willing to add Gbagbo supporters to his Cabinet, provided the incumbent steps down, Ivory Coast's ambassador to the United Nations said this week. Ambassador Youssoufou Bamba said Ouattara would not enter a power-sharing government similar to that in Zimbabwe but that he would be open to a unity Cabinet. U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq could not confirm any such offer from the Ouattara government and said that U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon still calls for Gbagbo to step down in an orderly transition. Ouattara told CNN last week that he welcomes a proposal for direct negotiations with Gbagbo -- on the condition that Gbagbo recognize Ouattara as president. But in a telephone interview Tuesday, Gbagbo spokesman Ahoua Don Melo rejected the idea, saying Ouattara ""should first go to the Constitutional Council to get recognized as the president before making any proposal."" An independent election commission declared Ouattara the winner of the vote, but the country's Constitutional Council invalidated those results and declared Gbagbo the winner. The U.S. Treasury froze Gbagbo's assets in the United States last week and barred Americans from doing business with him. His wife and three top aides also were sanctioned. Ouattara remains in the Golf Hotel under the protection of U.N. peacekeepers. The United Nations and an ever-increasing number of other nations have recognized Ouattara, a former prime minister, as the rightful election winner. The United States and other countries have offered Gbagbo what they call a ""dignified exit,"" which could mean living and working in other countries, including the United States. Gbagbo, however, has ignored those offers and has refused to accept telephone calls from U.S. officials. Ouattara has said he will ensure protection for Gbagbo if he concedes, said Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga, the African Union envoy for a multinational mediation effort. U.N. Security Council members have also ""strongly condemned and demanded an immediate halt"" to media efforts to ""propagate false information to incite hatred and violence,"" and condemned the ongoing blockade around the Golf Hotel. Meanwhile, the United Nations' refugee agency is building a refugee camp for Ivorians fleeing to neighboring Liberia. The camp will initially be capable of housing some 18,000 refugees, it said. At present, there are about 25,000 Ivorian refugees in Liberia, with about 600 more arriving daily, it said. The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said it has sufficient relief supplies for about 30,000 people in Liberia and ""is ready to mobilize stocks from Ghana for an additional 30,000 people if the need arises.""

"(CNN) -- Lower Saxony, the state hardest hit by Germany's tainted egg scandal, has lifted a quarantine on 3,000 poultry and hog farms after tests proved negative for increased dioxin levels, officials said Monday. The state may lift the quarantine on more farms once additional test results come in Monday, said the state's ministry for consumer protection and agriculture. Also Monday, Germany's minister for agriculture and consumer affairs, Ilse Aigner, published an initiative for animal feed safety in reaction to the scandal. The initiative calls for consideration of harsher punishments for violations of the law. The list was published after a crisis meeting between Aigner and representatives of the country's animal feed industry. ""Today, events like the discovery of dioxin animal are not merely local in nature anymore. They have regional and possibly even global effects in concerning public health and economic damage,"" the initiative says. ""The federal ministries for consumer protection and justice together will explore the need to adjust current laws."" The initiative also calls for stricter registration rules and a strict separation of ingredients for animal feeds and those for other industrial processes. Meanwhile, Danish investigators said Monday they are looking into the possibility that contaminated animal feed from Germany may have been given to hens in Denmark. The feed, contaminated with dioxin, was purchased by a Danish firm late last year, said Kim Vandrup Sigsgaard with the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration. ""There is an ongoing investigation to see if the contaminated feed was consumed by breeder hens, which are not meant for consumption,"" he said. Such hens are bred for their eggs, and not sold for their meat, he said. Sigsgaard said his agency was warned about the feed entering Denmark by the European Union's food safety system, the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed, on Sunday. Last week, Germany filed criminal charges against the company at the heart of the country's tainted egg scandal. The company, Harles and Jentzsch, apparently knew for months that fatty acid it was delivering to animal-feed makers was contaminated with dioxin, said Christian Seifert, a spokesman for the agricultural ministry in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein. Criminal charges have been filed against the company, Seifert said, ""because they did not immediately inform"" the agricultural ministry that dioxin levels surpassed the allowed amount. Authorities allege that the company sold about 3,000 tons of contaminated fatty acids to dozens of companies making animal feed across Germany. In response, the government quarantined more than 4,700 pig and poultry farms. Harles and Jentzsch laboratory tests from March 2010 showed they exceeded the ceiling level for dioxin, he said. ""At that point they had to stop delivering this product and immediately inform the authorities. They did not do either,"" Seifert said. Government officials learned of the higher concentrations of dioxin in December, he said. Several attempts to reach Harles and Jentzsch last week for comment were unsuccessful. Dioxin levels in the final feed product were diluted and it is likely they did not exceed allowed amounts, Seifert said. ""Of course that is no excuse. The conduct is still wrong,"" he said. The farms shut down include not only ones raising chickens and other poultry, but also pig farms, said Pierre Vetter, a spokesman for Germany's Ministry for Agriculture and Consumer Protection. State authorities quarantined all farms that received animal feed from companies affected, regardless of whether there is proof that the feed was contaminated, the ministry's website said. ""The state authorities are right to quarantine products -- eggs and meat -- that may have been exposed to contaminated feed, even if there is no concrete scientific evidence in all cases,"" Aigner said in a statement. About 130,000 possibly contaminated eggs were exported from a company in Germany to a food company in Netherlands, where they were to be used in industrial food production, said Holger Eichele, a spokesman for Germany's Ministry for Agriculture and Consumer Protection. The UK Food Standards Agency said a pasteurized mixture including some of the contaminated eggs was distributed in Britain. ""The mixing of the eggs will have diluted the levels of dioxins and they are not thought to be a risk to health,"" the agency said in a statement. Dioxins are a family of toxic chemicals that share a similar chemical structure and have been characterized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as likely human carcinogens.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israel was silent Friday as a week of massive street protests engulfed the streets of Cairo and other Egyptian  cities. Neither officials from Prime  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office nor the Israeli foreign ministry offered  any public comment on the  growing  political instability in Israel's most important regional ally  . After the first day of Cairo street  protests on Tuesday, Israeli Knesset member Benjamin Ben Eliezer, known as the Israeli  politician with the closest ties to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,  told Israeli Army Radio that he did not  believe the demonstrations would bring down the regime for lack of a viable leadership in the opposition. ""There is no leading figure that  can lead the wave of protests till the regime falls,"" he said. ""This is not a regime of one  person, but it is backed by the army, the intelligence agencies and the secret  service."". It was an assessment shared by more  than a few Israeli analysts and government  officials, but by Friday night, underscoring just  how rapidly events were  moving, Arab affairs analysts for the two major Israeli television  networks were talking about the possibility of Mubarak being forced from  power. While the relationship between Israel and Egypt is  frequently described as a ""cold peace,"" the two countries maintain significant  intelligence and security ties. In addition to its role as facilitator in  on-and-off-again talks between the Israelis and the Palestinians, Egypt shares a number of mutual  interests with Israel, including curbing the influence of Iran in both Lebanon  and Gaza. The two countries signed a historic peace agreement in  1979, and during his 28 years in office, Mubarak has worked with eight  Israeli prime ministers.","There's been no official comment from the Israeli government about the Egyptian situation .

"(CNN) -- Paraguay striker Roque Santa Cruz hopes to revive his stalled career after securing a return to his old stomping ground at English Premier League club Blackburn Rovers. The 29-year-old has left high-flying Manchester City on loan for the rest of this season, having failed to make an impact following his $28 million move from Blackburn in mid-2009. ""I feel like I am coming home. This has been the easiest decision of my career,"" he told the Blackburn website on Friday. ""I want to get playing and scoring goals again, and this is a real chance for me to prove myself after a frustrating period. Everyone knows what Blackburn Rovers means to me."" Santa Cruz scored 29 goals in two seasons at Ewood Park after joining on a free transfer from German club Bayern Munich, and he followed former Rovers manager Mark Hughes to City. Who will be the bargain signings of the January sales? But he initially struggled with injury and failed to impress Hughes' successor Roberto Mancini as Carlos Tevez, Emmanuel Adebayor, Mario Balotelli and recent signing Edin Dzeko have taken precedence. Mancini has this week also allowed former England defender Wayne Bridge to join the Premier League's bottom club West Ham on loan for the rest of this season. Blackburn have missed out with ambitious bids for Ronaldinho and David Beckham since Venky's took over the club, but manager Steve Kean believes the move for Santa Cruz is proof of the Indian owners' commitment to success. ""That is something that shows the fans we can now go and compete, and we can see off other teams -- not only in this country but abroad,"" he said. Italian club Genoa have signed Argentina international striker Mauro Boselli on loan until the end of this season from struggling English club Wigan. The 25-year-old has struggled to make an impact since joining from Estudiantes, where he was top scorer in last season's Primera Clasura. ""At the moment he is not in a position where he can help the club, and I am confident he will come back a better and stronger player after his stay in Italy,"" Wigan's Spanish manager Roberto Martinez told the club's website. South Africa's World Cup midfielder Steven Pienaar is expected to leave English club Everton after manager David Moyes revealed on Friday that a bid had been accepted for the player. The 28-year-old, who has been linked with Tottenham and Inter Milan, is out of contract at the end of this season, and has turned down a new deal. ""We have had two offers -- one of which has been accepted -- and we have given permission for his representatives to speak to the club involved,"" Moyes told the Everton website.","Blackburn bring Roque Santa Cruz back to Ewood Park from Manchester City .

"(CNN) -- Carlos Sainz claimed a record 23rd stage win at the Dakar Rally on Friday, but the Spaniard's title reign in the car category is coming to a close. The 48-year-old overtook race legend Stephane Peterhansel for overall victories as he claimed his sixth in the 33rd edition of the endurance event, but he trails Volkswagen teammate Nasser Al-Attiyah by more than an hour ahead of the final leg going into Buenos Aires. Sainz's challenge came unstuck on Thursday when he suffered a broken suspension in the 11th leg between Chilecito and San Juan in Argentina, allowing teammate Ginier De Villiers to move up into second overall. The South African was second in Friday's penultimate stage ahead of Al-Attiyah, but is almost 50 minutes behind the Qatari -- who is almost assured his maiden victory at the event after finishing runner-up last year. ""It really was the hardest stage of my life, because I had to keep concentrated and not make any mistakes,"" the 40-year-old Al-Attiyah told the race's website. Fear and loathing in South America . ""Sometimes I was going fast, sometimes slow, because I needed to keep my concentration and keep the same pace, but it was okay. We finished the stage without any problems and I'm really quite happy."" Spain's Marc Coma is similarly in pole position to clinch a third title in the motorbike category after winning his fourth stage this year by 37 seconds from defending champion Cyril Depres. Coma has an overall advantage of more than 16 minutes from the Frenchman, who is also riding for the KTM team. ""Today was complicated due to all the rain that fell last night. As a result, it was a very technical stage, like in endurance racing. But it went fine,"" Coma told the race's website. ""There is still a 190-kilometer stage left to race tomorrow. Normally, there shouldn't be any complications, but we still need to race them, it's there to be done."" Defending truck champion Vladimir Chagin is on course for his seventh title after claiming his sixth stage win, leaving him more than 31 minutes ahead of fellow Russian and Kamaz-Master teammate Firdaus Kabirov. In the quad bikes, last year's runner-up Alejandro Patronelli is poised for his maiden triumph as he holds an even bigger lead ahead over fellow Argentine Sebastian Halpern, one of his Yamaha teammates. Halpern was second on Friday, while Patronelli was back in fourth eight minutes adrift.","Carlos Sainz gains consolation record the day after his title challenge effectively ends .

"Muscat, Oman (CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is urging countries in the Persian Gulf region to support Iraq's newly created government as she prepares to head to an international forum on development and the environment. ""There's a government in Iraq that's embraced by the Iraqi people. The attitude toward that government and Iraq among its Arab neighbors is changing. More and more people are seeking out relationships, seeking out trade agreements, opening embassies,"" Clinton said. In that regard, Gulf states have ""got more to do, but they're making progress. ... I'm encouraged,"" she said. Clinton spoke to CNN Wednesday in Muscat, Oman, a day before she was to meet with regional leaders in Qatar at the ""Forum for the Future."" In late December, the Iraqi parliament voted in Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's government, which is inclusive of Iraq's major ethnic and sectarian groups. The long-awaited legislative action came more than nine months after a hotly disputed national election that threatened to inflame the country's deep sectarian tensions. If other countries in the region do not acknowledge Iraq's new ""inclusive government,"" Clinton said, ""that would be a great mistake."" ""What we see is Iraq increasingly asserting itself. Iran is a big neighbor. Iran is a big presence in this entire region, and obviously, next door to Iraq as well,"" she said. ""But we also see the other sets of power in the region beginning to step up and make sure that Iraq is part of the larger community, and that's very important."" She also insisted that progress is being made regarding Iran, saying the United States has moved the world from merely condemning Iran to enacting sanctions that she says are working. Clinton conceded there's still a long way to go toward convincing Iran to give up its nuclear ambitions. ""Can we run up the flag and say, oh no, we've reached the conclusion we sought? Not yet, but we are making progress,"" she said. Clinton's six-day trip to the region also included a stop in the United Arab Emirates. Before her stop in Oman, she made a surprise visit Tuesday to poverty-stricken Yemen, a key al Qaeda battleground and planning center in recent years. During the wide-ranging interview Wednesday, Clinton defended U.S. expanded efforts to help Yemen. The country has thus far been unable to stop an al Qaeda affiliate from operating in its country, where it planned failed bombing attempts on the United States. ""Walking away from Yemen, not supporting it in both the counterterrorism efforts and its broader development needs, would be ceding the ground to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula,"" she said. ""That would be a very tragic mistake."" While in Yemen, she told reporters that the United States wants to take a two-pronged approach to helping that country. One is with military assistance to help fight al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, and the other is to provide help for social and economic development as the nation runs out of oil and water. ""I hope that the American people understand that this is being done because, first and foremost, this is in our national security interest. Walking away from Yemen, not supporting it, in both the counterterrorism efforts and its broader development needs, would be basically ceding the ground to Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. That would be a very tragic mistake, in my opinion,"" she said. In her Wednesday interview with CNN, Clinton also reiterated her earlier characterization of the weekend shooting rampage outside an Arizona supermarket as an example of ""extremism."" ""Based on what I know, this is a criminal defendant who was, in some ways, motivated by his own political views; who had a particular animus toward the congresswoman. And I think when you cross the line from expressing opinions ... into taking action that's violent action, that is a hallmark of extremism -- whether it comes from the right, the left, from al Qaeda, from anarchists, whoever it is -- that is a form of extremism,"" she said. Also in Wednesday's interview, Clinton described China as a ""big presence in our world today,"" adding the United States needs to have a ""positive relationship"" with that country because its importance will be even greater in the future. Chinese President Hu Jintao is set to visit Washington next week. Clinton also addressed Lebanon, where members of the powerful Hezbollah movement and its allies resigned from the Cabinet Wednesday, bringing down the government of Prime Minister Saad Hariri. Hezbollah opposes a U.N.-backed special tribunal that is widely expected to indict members of the Shiite Muslim group in the assassination of Rafik Hariri, the current prime minister's father. ""We view what happened today as a transparent effort by those forces inside Lebanon as well as interests outside Lebanon to subvert justice and undermine Lebanon's stability and progress,"" Clinton said. ""Trying to bring the government down as a way to undermine the special tribunal is the abdication of responsibility, but it also will not work."" CNN's Laurie Ure contributed to this report.","Clinton says more governments should seek relationships with Iraq .

"New York (CNN) -- Convicted Ponzi-schemer Bernard Madoff will not attend the funeral of his son, Mark, out of consideration for his daughter-in-law and grandchildren, attorney Ira Sorkin said. Mark Madoff's body was discovered hanging from a ceiling pipe in his Manhattan apartment on Saturday, two years to the day after his father was arrested for swindling $50 billion from investors in the largest Ponzi scheme in U.S. history. The death of the younger Madoff was ruled a suicide by the New York medical examiner's office after an autopsy on Sunday, spokeswoman Ellen Borakove said. ""He will be conducting a private service on his own where he's presently incarcerated,"" Sorkin said. Madoff, 71, is at the Butner Federal Correction Complex, a medium-security prison in eastern North Carolina, where he is serving a 150-year prison sentence. Reports from several media outlets Monday said Madoff would not seek to attend his son's funeral -- prison rules prohibit prisoners with more than two years left on their prison terms from having furloughs. Madoff bilked investors out of their money by masquerading as the head of a legitimate investment firm while using funds from new investors to send payments to his earlier investors, falsely portraying them as proceeds when they were actually stolen money, prosecutors said. Madoff's criminal activities spawned a tidal wave of civil actions against Mark Madoff, his mother, siblings and hundreds of other defendants, accused of profiting off the Ponzi scheme by withdrawing more money from Madoff's fund than they invested, money they presumably thought was investment income. A person familiar with the family says Mark Madoff has not been in touch with his extended family for the past two years. Irving Picard, the court-appointed trustee in charge of recovering and distributing Madoff's assets, has filed a slew of lawsuits in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan over the past week on behalf of some of Madoff's victims. One filed on December 8 named Mark Madoff -- as well as his brother Andrew Madoff and uncle Peter Madoff -- as one of several defendants in a civil lawsuit.","NEW: ""He will be conducting a private service on his own,"" lawyer says .

"(Mashable)  -- The Samsung Continuum was announced earlier at the New York Stock Exchange, but the phone itself was just unveiled in Times Square. It will take its place beside the Galaxy S and will, at least initially, be available exclusively on Verizon Wireless. The device is similar to the Galaxy S in many ways. Its face is made from a 3.4-inch Super AMOLED touchscreen, making it perfect for media consumption. Additionally, the device is DLNA-compliant, so it can quickly connect with TVs and other devices with DLNA capabilities. But the most distinguishing feature of this device isn't its main display; it's a secondary, 1.8-inch, Super AMOLED display. The ""ticker"" display is used to display information ranging from incoming calls to status messages. It's also touch capable and, when the primary screen is being actively used, incoming messages are routed to it, so the primary activity isn't interrupted. The ticker can be activated separately from the main display using a unique grip sensor on the sides of the device. This allows users to discreetly look at relevant information without illuminating the considerably brighter main display. Disappointingly, the Continuum will ship with Android 2.1, but Samsung has assured it will be updated rapidly. The question is whether Samsung will update to Android 2.2 or go straight to 2.3 (Gingerbread). The Samsung Continuum will be available for pre-order on November 11. It will be available in stores on November 18 -- one day before the Droid Pro -- for $200 after a $100 mail-in rebate. © 2010 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- African champions TP Mazembe Englebert are through to the semifinals of the World Club Cup in Abu Dhabi after a 1-0 victory over Mexican side Pachuca. The Congolese side secured a last four showdown with South American champions Internacional, courtesy of Mbenza Beli's first-half strike, despite playing the final nine minutes with just 10 men. Pachuca nearly took the lead in the 19th minute when Alejandro Manso's left-foot volley bounced back off the post. But, just two minutes later, it was Mazembe who struck the only goal of the game when Bedi lashed the ball home after being put through by Mulota Kabangu. Beli had scored Mazembe's only goal in last year's tournament, in the 2-1 defeat by Pohang Steelers, but this time his side managed to hold on despite a second-half Pachuca onslaught. And they achieved that feat despite playing the closing stages a man down, after Stoppila Sunzu was sent off following a second yellow card offense. Korean side Seongnam Ilhwa Chunma will next face local favorites Al-Wahda for the right to play European champions Inter Milan in the other semifinal showdown.","African champions TP Mazembe Englebert through to semifinals of World Club Cup .

"(CNN) -- The TSA is not as bad you think they are. At least, that's what a list of ""myths and facts"" issued Thursday by the TSA about pat-downs and other security measures would like you to consider. Many Americans have reacted with displeasure, or even outrage, over recent high-profile stories about intrusive searches at airports. In one of the instances that reverberated the strongest, a California man's video of his encounter with TSA agents went viral. John Tyner refused an X-ray scan and then famously told agents that, ""if you touch my junk, I'll have you arrested."" In its fact sheet, the TSA says that pat-downs only occur when a passenger sets off a metal detector or opts out of an X-ray scan. The latter is what led to Tyner's confrontation with the TSA. Some see the pat-downs as a punishment for refusing to get scanned, but the TSA says that is not the case. ""There is nothing punitive about it -- it just makes good security sense,"" the TSA said. ""And the weapons and other dangerous and prohibited items we've found during pat-downs speak to this."" There are 400 full-body scanning machines at 69 airports nationwide, according to the TSA. About 24 million air travelers are expected to fly over the Thanksgiving holiday period, according to the Air Transport Association of America, an airline trade group. Grass-roots groups are urging travelers either not to fly or to protest by opting out of the full-body scanners and undergoing time-consuming pat-downs instead. Industry leaders are worried about the backlash. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano met with leaders of travel industry groups to discuss the concerns. Another myth that the TSA tackled is that all children will receive pat-downs. Children who require extra screening who are under 12 receive a modified pat-down, the TSA said. That news probably isn't reassuring for teenagers who draw a secondary security screening. Capt. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, the hero pilot, has gone on record as a critic of the TSA measures. He said the use of full-body pat-downs and advanced imaging scanners for airline personnel ""just isn't an efficient use of our resources."" Then there is the issue of whether the full-body scans, done in advance imaging technology, or AIT machines, are safe. It is a myth that they are not safe, the TSA says. The Backscatter technology used in the machines has been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institute for Standards and Technology, the TSA says. ""In fact, a traveler is exposed to less radiation from one AIT scan than from two minutes of an airline flight,"" the fact sheet says. Passengers have also expressed concerns that the images from the scanners can be saved or transmitted to other devices. The TSA also calls this a myth, saying that the scanning machines do not have the capability to save or transmit images, and that other devices, such as cell phones with cameras, are not allowed in the screening rooms.","TSA says that pat-downs are only for those who set off metal detectors .

"(CNN) -- Most of the wintry precipitation had moved on by Monday night, but much of the South is likely to see white stuff on the ground until the weekend as an Arctic low slides in, bringing low temperatures in the teens and highs barely out of the 20s. And a snow storm surging over the Plains and into the Ohio Valley promises to merge with the Southeast storm Tuesday night and slam into the Mid-Atlantic Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service. The storm brought treacherous travel conditions across the Southeast Monday, with schools and government offices shut down from Arkansas to the Atlantic. Those conditions aren't expected to change overnight as temperatures remain below freezing, making morning commutes on Tuesday no better. In Atlanta, airlines canceled hundreds of flights Monday -- and plan to cancel more on Tuesday. AirTran spokesman Christopher White said the airline would begin operation ""with a greatly reduced flight schedule"" and warned that flights heading to the Northeast would likely be affected at least through Wednesday. Delta, which canceled almost a third of its flights across the country Monday, said it planned at least 1,400 cancellations on Tuesday. Spokesman Anthony Black said the airline was keeping a close eye on the Northeast for late Tuesday and early Wednesday. Both airlines were offering one-time flight changes with no fees for a limited period. And if air travel was limited, road travel was nearly non-existent. Impassable roads were the norm across the region, although that didn't keep everyone at home -- particularly truckers trying to keep their schedules. And some of those truckers caused some of the problems. Monday night in Atlanta, jackknifed tractor-trailers had blocked the east side of Interstate 285, which encircles the city, from Interstate 75 on the south to Interstate 85 on the northeast. Another had been stuck on fabled Peachtree Street in the city's Midtown district for hours. Georgia emergency officials warned people to stay off the roads if at all possible from central Georgia north. Atlanta police were dealing with so many accidents that the department announced it would only work accidents with injuries and provided an online form for drivers to report others. In Alabama, traffic accidents claimed two lives, one in Lowndes County and the other in Tuscaloosa County. Parts of the northern part of the state got 6 inches to 10 inches of snow, according to state Emergency Management spokeswoman Yasmie Richardson, and three-fourths of the state received snow or ice. Mississippi emergency officials reported a single fatal traffic accident on Sunday as sleet began moving into the state. No part of Carolinas was unaffected by the snows and ice, particularly the mountainous west where snowfalls of up to 18 inches were reported. North Carolina and South Carolina both expected freezing rain and sleet into Tuesday morning. The Tennessee Department of Transportation reported extremely hazardous conditions in the mountainous east, but ice and snow was also causing problems in other parts of the state. The governors of Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina declared states of emergency. Double-digit snow depths were reported Monday in the Tennessee towns of Minor Hill (13 inches) and Lawrenceburg (11 inches), and in Oxford, Mississippi (10 inches). Other areas reporting heavy accumulations were Greenville, North Carolina (9 inches), Asheville, North Carolina (7 inches), and Huntsville, Alabama (7 inches). Canton, Georgia, and Greenville, South Carolina, each reported 6 inches. Reported power outages were relatively few early Monday. About 2,300 homes in Louisiana and 4,000 in Mississippi lost power, according to authorities in those states, and power had been restored to most of them. Nearly 2,000 Georgia customers were out of power, according Georgia Electric Membership Corp, and Georgia Power reported 3,000 customers out. But the snow brought out some revelers, too. In Kennesaw, northwest of Atlanta, Sarah DeRoch's daughter Gwyneth was bursting with anticipation of a whole day to play in the snow. ""She's been asking me every five minutes, 'Did they close the schools?'"" DeRoch said. In tiny Pine Lake, east of Atlanta, the city closed its steepest street to vehicular traffic -- but left it open for sledding. It drew dozens of kids (and adults) for a slippery ride down the street, a long trudge back up -- to an open fire pit, s'mores and hot chocolate. Most Atlanta students also will be staying home Tuesday, as well, as the major school districts announced closings will stretch into another day, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The situation was much the same in other metro areas along the storm's route: Most school districts near Birmingham, Alabama; Greenville-Spartanburg, South Carolina; and Charlotte, North Carolina, will be closed Tuesday, local media reported Monday. As the storm pressed farther to the northeast Monday, New Jersey and Delaware went under winter storm warnings, while winter storm watches were in place in much of the Northeastern seaboard and New England. The National Weather Service predicted 5 inches to 8 inches in the Philadelphia area, 4 inches or more in northern New Jersey and 2 to 6 inches in southern Delaware from Tuesday afternoon into Wednesday morning. In the Southeast, the National Weather Service expected a high approaching 40 on Tuesday -- but the Arctic front currently bringing snow into the Midwest would sink into the south, without the precipitation but with frigid temperatures. While the snowstorm was a headache to drivers and businesses, it proved to be a help to police in one Georgia town. Officers investigating a pre-dawn burglary at a liquor store in Dalton, Georgia, simply followed a set of tracks in the otherwise undisturbed snow from the store to a nearby apartment complex. There, after knocking on the door where the footprints led, they found a pair of teenagers along with a backpack full of liquor bottles carrying stickers that matched bottles in the burglarized store. Two young men were arrested and charged with burglary and criminal destruction of property.

"(CNN) -- Snowstorms barreled across New England on Wednesday, canceling flights, closing schools and creating treacherous road conditions for weather-weary travelers. Massachusetts Gov. Duval Patrick declared a state of emergency, mobilizing 250 National Guardsmen as a precaution, as officials warned of blizzard conditions across the state and into southern New Hampshire. ""The wind is blowing very hard and that's what most unpleasant,"" said Brookline, Massachusetts, resident Bonnie Sashin. ""It's blowing ice into your face."" Forecasters said accumulation in scattered areas across Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Hampshire and Vermont could reach between 25 and 34 inches, while most areas expected 8 to 16 inches of snow. Snowfall in the heaviest areas reached rates of 2 to 3 inches per hour, according to the National Weather Service. Some residents in Brattleboro, Vermont, donned cross-country skis as they traveled down snow-jammed roads, while their neighbors heaved shovelfuls of snow out of driveways and sidewalks, said town resident Caleb Clark. More than 15,000 households were without power in Massachusetts, including thousands of customers in Plymouth County who were affected by a transmission-line outage, according to the National Grid utility company's website. The hardest-hit areas included Plymouth, Bristol, Essex, Norfolk and Suffolk counties in Massachusetts, the utility company said. ""This is the second major storm we are battling in less than three weeks,"" said Christopher E. Root, National Grid senior vice president of electricity operations.  ""We ask that our customers bear with us and be patient as our crews work in challenging weather conditions to restore service as safely and quickly as possible."" Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino said the city's snow emergency and parking ban will be lifted at 9 a.m. Thursday, but public schools will be closed as crews continue clearing roads. He urged citizens to use public transportation. Amtrak said it has suspended rail service between New York and Boston, and between Springfield, Massachusetts, and New Haven, Connecticut, due to severe weather and fallen trees, according to its website. Every state except Florida now has snow on the ground, including Hawaii, according to CNN meteorologist Sean Morris. High winds hampered cleanup efforts across the region, particularly along the New England coast, forecasters predicted. A band of moderate to heavy snow is expected to continue to move north along the coast, with heavy precipitation leaving southern Maine by Wednesday night, officials said. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said he lifted the ""weather emergency"" on Wednesday, as salting crews and snow plows finished clearing city streets. The mayor said that 30 vehicles had been towed as a result of the storm. That number is in stark contrast to the thousands of cars, buses and ambulances left stranded last month after cleanup crews struggled to plow streets days after the storm. Bloomberg -- who faced sharp criticism over the slow emergency response -- said New York was better equipped to tackle Wednesday's storm. More than 1,700 flights were canceled at the New York area's three major airports, while hundreds more were grounded at Boston's Logan International Airport, officials said. General manager at LaGuardia Airport Thomas Bosco said many airlines pre-emptively canceled flights ahead of the weather Wednesday to avoid massive delays that plagued airports during last month's holiday blizzard. Philadelphia declared a snow emergency Tuesday night, while public schools there and in Boston were closed. Non-emergency state employees did not have to report to work Wednesday, according to the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency. But New York City public schools remained open, with field trips canceled, according to the office of the city's schools chancellor. The city's public schools have closed six times -- for a total of eight days -- since 1978, the office said. In the South, normally bustling cities such as Atlanta and Charlotte, North Carolina, grappled with the unusual onslaught of ice and snow this week. AirTran Airways spokesman Christopher White said the airline is in ""full recovery mode"" to get traffic back to normal in the coming days at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. The company canceled more than 90 Wednesday flights, after more than 260 flights were taken off the schedule Tuesday. Both Delta Air Lines and AirTran were offering one-time flight changes with no fees for a limited period. Delta canceled 1,200 flights Wednesday and has canceled 80 for Thursday because of snow in the Northeast. The airline said its Atlanta operations have returned to normal.

"(CNN) -- TP Mazembe from the Democratic Republic of Congo defeated Tunisian team Esperance 6-1 on aggregate to retain their African Champion's League title on Saturday. Having won the first leg 5-0, Mazembe were overwhelming favorites ahead of the clash in Rades but fell behind to an early goal from Esperance's Ghanaian defender Harrison Afful. The team from Tunis' celebrations were cut short moments later when Ben Amor was sent off for spitting at an opposition player. Mazembe sealed a second successive triumph with just over 20 minutes remaining, when Mukok Kanda equalized and ended any hopes of an Esperance comeback. The Congolese-league winners have created history by becoming the first team to retain African-club football's top honor twice, having previously won back-to-back crowns in 1967-68. Lamine N'Diaye -- Mazembe head coach -- was delighted to have captured the African Champion's League in his first season with the team. ""It was a big challenge, and I feel proud to have achieved the ultimate in African club football,"" N'Diaye told the website of football's world governing body, FIFA. ""I've had great joy in football, but this victory is a lot of happiness.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A British general who advocates a troop ""surge"" in Afghanistan will be appointed head of the British Army next year, the Ministry of Defense said Friday. General David Richards is to become the new head of the British Army next year. Gen. David Richards, the current commander-in-chief of British Land Forces, will take over from Gen. Richard Dannatt in August 2009, when Dannatt's three-year term expires, the defense ministry said. Richards, who is responsible for delivering forces to Afghanistan, Iraq, and Kosovo in his current role, was head of NATO forces in Afghanistan between May 2006 and February 2007. In a June interview with the defense ministry's Defence Focus magazine, Richards called for more troops in order to succeed in Afghanistan. ""Though things have improved, don't think for one minute we can believe that we are 'winning,'"" Richards told the magazine. ""We need to define success carefully and continue to look for opportunities to increase troops for the surge effect that the Americans had in Iraq. We need boots on the ground and reconstruction to win their hearts and minds."" Richards told the magazine that the situation in the country had improved since he commanded NATO forces there, in part because troop numbers had doubled. London's Independent newspaper reported Friday that Richards favors 30,000 additional troops for Afghanistan -- 5,000 more British troops and 25,000 U.S. and Afghan soldiers. Britain currently has about 8,000 troops in Afghanistan, the Ministry of Defense said. Richards also believes that a negotiated settlement may be necessary to end the conflict, but that any talks must take place with the Afghan government and NATO in a position of strength, The Independent reported. Although Friday's announcement does not mean an early retirement for Dannatt, British news reports Friday said Dannatt may be passed over for the job of head of the UK armed forces when he steps down from his current role. News reports said Dannatt, 57, had irritated top officials with comments on Iraq policy and highlighting serious strains on the armed forces. In July, Dannatt defended himself after reports that he was expected to resign early. In a letter to The Daily Telegraph newspaper, Dannatt said he intended to serve his full term.","British general who advocates a troop ""surge"" in Afghanistan to head army .

"New York (CNN) -- With memories of a monster Christmas blizzard still fresh, another blast of winter weather charged across eastern states Friday, with winter advisories issued as far south as middle Georgia. A large complex winter system stretched across the Northeast Friday, making for messy commutes in cities like Philadelphia, but bringing fewer inches of accumulation than the massive storm that paralyzed much of New York less than two weeks ago. By Friday afternoon, 391 flights at New York's three major airports had been canceled as a result of snow, according to spokesman Steve Coleman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. ""Overall we're talking less than 10 percent of the normal traffic,"" Coleman said. ""Most of these flights were canceled before the snow even really started."" Twenty flights at Philadelphia International Airport also were canceled as the storm rolled through the region, causing minor delays at Logan International Airport in Boston, officials said. Several major airlines -- including American, United/Continental, U.S. Airways and Delta -- announced that their customers could voluntarily reschedule flights to and from snow-affected areas without penalty. Southwest Airlines expanded the option for passengers flying in and out of not just New York and Pennsylvania airports but also Washington Dulles and Baltimore/Washington airports. The National Weather Service issued winter storm warnings, watches and advisories for portions of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Vermont for Friday. Separate alerts also were issued for parts of Kentucky, Tennessee and North Carolina. Forecasters projected between 2 and 4 inches of snow across the greater New York City area, with heavier amounts expected over eastern sections of Long Island. Snow was predicted later in the weekend for Atlanta and areas even farther south. ""I spoke to a couple of folks and they're just worried about the cleanup work afterwards,"" said New York resident . Hoyman Leung. ""The last round, they were certainly deficient."" Emergency workers, criticized for their slow response to the blizzard two weeks ago, will get another chance to prove themselves. Mayor Michael Bloomberg said New York has already instituted a series of changes. The heavy snow over the Christmas weekend hampered morning commuters, delayed first responders and even prevented aircraft service personnel from reaching airports where 29 international flights were stuck on the tarmac for more than three hours, officials said. Following sharp criticism of the city's slow response, John Doherty, the chief of the sanitation department, has made management and personnel shake-ups in Brooklyn. An investigation is currently under way into whether sanitation workers intentionally delayed cleanup efforts over frustrations about demotions and citywide budget cuts. Bloomberg also announced that a handful of the city's 1,700 snow plows will be fitted with global positioning systems in a pilot program meant to better track the vehicles. ""It gives us the ability to check on the location and progress of our snow plows,"" Bloomberg told reporters, saying that the devices will be added to some trucks in New York's Brooklyn and one station in Queens, where many residents were left snowbound by the previous storm. The city is also deploying scout teams to transmit video images of neighborhoods back to City Hall during cleanup efforts, the mayor said.","NEW: 391 flights are canceled at New York's three major airports .

"Geneva, Switzerland (CNN) -- Iranian officials sat down Monday with the United States and other countries trying to put the brakes on Tehran's nuclear program, a day after Iran announced it is self-sufficient in the nuclear fuel cycle. There was ""an exchange of views and concerns,"" between the Iranians and envoys from the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, plus Germany, a diplomatic source familiar with the talks told CNN. The Iranian nuclear program was the main issue on the table, the source said. Iran has previously said it did not want the talks to focus on that. Iran also raised some of its concerns, the source said, including attacks on two Iranian scientists in Tehran last week that left one dead and one injured. The diplomatic source and a Western official later both told CNN that the talks had ended for the day and would resume Tuesday. The United States and other countries fear that Iran wants to develop nuclear weapons, an allegation Tehran has always denied. The meeting in Switzerland is between Iran on the one hand and the so-called P5 plus 1 group -- the United States, China, France, Germany, Russia and United Kingdom -- on the other. But bilateral talks also are going on, the diplomatic source said, refusing to say who was talking to whom. The source asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the negotiations. The talks are going on behind closed doors and no public statements have been made so far. They'll continue Tuesday, the source said. And the P5 plus 1 nations are prepared to offer more talks if the Iranians agree to focus seriously on the nuclear issue. The group has been meeting intermittently, with the last round of talks coming over a year ago. Mike Hammer, a spokesman for the U.S. National Security Council, said Sunday the talks would try ""to underscore the concern of the entire international community in Iran's actions and intentions."" Iran already faces stiff sanctions from the international community, because it has continued to enrich uranium. With the political barbs flying back and forth regularly, tensions were raised even further last Monday when bombers targeted two Iranian nuclear scientists. Iran blamed Israel, the United States and the United Kingdom's spy agencies for the attacks, which killed Majid Shahriari and injured Fereydoun Abbasi. But Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, told state-run Press TV on Sunday that the ""assassination of Iranian scientists will not hamper our progress."" Salehi also said that Iran is now producing yellowcake, meaning its nuclear program is self-sufficient since it now produces everything needed to make nuclear fuel. He said the yellowcake came from the Gachin mine near Gander Abbas, on Iran's southern coast near the Strait of Hormuz. It's not clear that Iran actually has the technology to complete the entire nuclear fuel cycle, despite Sunday's announcement. But U.S. officials weren't surprised by the announcement, with Hammer saying, ""Iran has been trying to develop an indigenous program for years given that the import of yellowcake is banned by United Nations Security Council resolutions."" He said the move raises further concerns about the Middle Eastern country's intentions, ""given that Iran's own supply of uranium is not enough for a peaceful nuclear energy program.""

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- One of two academics attacked in Iran on Monday was a scientist involved in nuclear or ballistic missile activities, Iranian news agencies and the United Nations reported. In separate but similar attacks, assailants on motorcycles attached bombs to cars carrying two professors at Shahid Beheshti University in Tehran, the semi-official Fars news agency of Iran reported. One of them, Fereydoun Abbasi, was injured along with his wife, Iranian news outlets said. Both were in ""good condition,"" a Tehran security chief said. A United Nations resolution cited Abbasi as a ""nuclear scientist,"" the state-run Press TV said. That suggests that the ""perpetrators behind the assassination could be traced through those who included the professor's name in the UN resolution,"" Press TV said. The resolution, from March 2007, identifies Abbasi as one of several people ""involved in nuclear or ballistic missile activities"" in Iran. It does not call him a ""nuclear scientist"" but describes him as a scientist for the Senior Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics who has links to the Institute of Applied Physics. The European Union froze Abbasi's assets last month as it imposed additional sanctions on Iran. The United Nations resolution says Abbasi has worked closely with another scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh-Mahabadi, who led the Physics Research Center in Iran. The International Atomic Energy Agency has sought to interview Fakhrizadeh-Mahabadi, but Iran has declined to allow that, the resolution says. A second explosion killed Majid Shahriyari, also a professor at Shahid Beheshti University in the Iranian capital, state-run Press TV reported. His wife and driver were injured. His area of research was not immediately reported. A separate bomb attack in Tehran in January killed ""an Iranian university professor and nuclear scientist"" identified as Massoud Ali Mohammadi, the semi-official Fars news agency said. Both of the professors targeted on Monday were members of the Basij, Iran's volunteer paramilitary group, the news agency said. Iran blamed the attack on the United States and Israel, a common practice in previous attacks on officials affiliated with Tehran's government. There have been no arrests, and no one claimed responsibility for the attacks, Tehran security commander Maj. Gen Hossein Sajedinia said, according to the semi-official Mehr news agency. CNN's Shirzad Bozorgmehr contributed to this report.","NEW: EU recently imposed sanctions on one of two academics attacked in Iran .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- A radical cleric imprisoned for his role in a deadly Pakistan mosque siege has vowed to continue his campaign to impose hardline Islamic law in his first sermon since being released. Maulana Abdul Aziz gave his first sermon since being released from house arrest. Maulana Abdul Aziz was freed on Thursday -- nearly two years after siege at Islamabad's Red Mosque that left 90 people dead, including Aziz's son and brother. Addressing Friday prayers in the battle-scarred mosque, Aziz said he was willing to see more blood spilled for his cause. ""My only son was killed for this great mission of Islam,"" he told a capacity crowd at the mosque. ""If I had 100 sons, I would ask them to die for Islam."" Aziz was arrested after the Pakistani government laid siege to the mosque in July 2007 to crack down on its efforts to promote Taliban-style sharia law. He was seized while trying to sneak away disguised with a women's burqa. He was held under house arrest until Pakistan's Supreme Court allowed his release late Thursday. It was the latest in a series of concessions by the government of President Asif Ali Zardari to Islamist militants. During Friday's sermon, Aziz argued that his supporters' fierce resistance during the siege, helped lead to a recent peace deal between the Pakistani government and Taliban militants in Pakistan's northwestern Swat Valley. This week, Zardari signed an agreement, allowing Taliban fighters to implement sharia law in Swat. In an interview with CNN, Aziz's spokesman Mohammed Amir Siddique said the cleric had no direct ties with the Taliban, but added ""We support them morally."" Aziz's sermon coincided with new international efforts to help combat extremism in Pakistan, seen as key to regional stability -- particularly in neighboring Afghanistan. At an international donors conference in Tokyo, countries including the United States and Saudi Arabia reportedly offered a total of $5 billion in aid to help boost economic development and improve security.","Cleric Maulana Abdul Aziz was freed from house arrest on Thursday .

The plans include doubling the Army's ranks to 135,000 and the police force to 80,000 by 2011, the officials said.

"(CNN) -- Sports superstar Roger Federer has organized a charity event to raise funds for the victims of the Haiti earthquake, as the tennis world rallies to contribute to the cause. Federer, the world's top-ranked player, will take part in an exhibition event in  Australia on Sunday along with other top names such as Rafael Nadal, Andy Roddick, Kim Clijsters, Serena Williams and Samantha Stosur. They will play in doubles matches at Melbourne Park in the state of Victoria's capital city, giving up their last day of preparation ahead of this year's opening Grand Slam tournament, the Australian Open. ""The entry fee is a minimum donation of $10. This should be fun and it's for a great cause,"" the Swiss said on his official Web site. ""I think it's something as a tennis family we're very happy to do. I know it's on the eve of the first Grand Slam of the season, so for some it's not so easy maybe mentally to separate a few things -- but I think it's a great initiative.

"John F. Kennedy was inaugurated as the 35th U.S. president on January 20, 1961. The following is a transcript of his inaugural address: . Vice President Johnson, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chief Justice, President Eisenhower, Vice President Nixon, President Truman, reverend clergy, fellow citizens: . We observe today not a victory of party but a celebration of freedom -- symbolizing an end as well as a beginning -- signifying renewal as well as change. For I have sworn before you and Almighty God the same solemn oath our forebears prescribed nearly a century and three quarters ago. The world is very different now. For man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life. And yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at issue around the globe -- the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state but from the hand of God. We dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution. Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans -- born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage -- and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed, and to which we are committed today at home and around the world. Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty. This much we pledge -- and more. To those old allies whose cultural and spiritual origins we share, we pledge the loyalty of faithful friends. United, there is little we cannot do in a host of cooperative ventures. Divided, there is little we can do -- for we dare not meet a powerful challenge at odds and split asunder. To those new states whom we welcome to the ranks of the free, we pledge our word that one form of colonial control shall not have passed away merely to be replaced by a far more iron tyranny. We shall not always expect to find them supporting our view. But we shall always hope to find them strongly supporting their own freedom -- and to remember that, in the past, those who foolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up inside. To those peoples in the huts and villages of half the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery, we pledge our best efforts to help them help themselves, for whatever period is required -- not because the communists may be doing it, not because we seek their votes, but because it is right. If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich. To our sister republics south of our border, we offer a special pledge -- to convert our good words into good deeds -- in a new alliance for progress -- to assist free men and free governments in casting off the chains of poverty. But this peaceful revolution of hope cannot become the prey of hostile powers. Let all our neighbors know that we shall join with them to oppose aggression or subversion anywhere in the Americas. And let every other power know that this hemisphere intends to remain the master of its own house. To that world assembly of sovereign states, the United Nations, our last best hope in an age where the instruments of war have far outpaced the instruments of peace, we renew our pledge of support -- to prevent it from becoming merely a forum for invective -- to strengthen its shield of the new and the weak -- and to enlarge the area in which its writ may run. Finally, to those nations who would make themselves our adversary, we offer not a pledge but a request: that both sides begin anew the quest for peace, before the dark powers of destruction unleashed by science engulf all humanity in planned or accidental self-destruction. We dare not tempt them with weakness. For only when our arms are sufficient, beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed. But neither can two great and powerful groups of nations take comfort from our present course -- both sides overburdened by the cost of modern weapons, both rightly alarmed by the steady spread of the deadly atom, yet both racing to alter that uncertain balance of terror that stays the hand of mankind's final war. So let us begin anew -- remembering on both sides that civility is not a sign of weakness, and sincerity is always subject to proof. Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate. Let both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring those problems which divide us. Let both sides, for the first time, formulate serious and precise proposals for the inspection and control of arms -- and bring the absolute power to destroy other nations under the absolute control of all nations. Let both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors. Together let us explore the stars, conquer the deserts, eradicate disease, tap the ocean depths and encourage the arts and commerce. Let both sides unite to heed in all corners of the Earth the command of Isaiah -- to ""undo the heavy burdens ... (and) let the oppressed go free."" And if a beachhead of cooperation may push back the jungle of suspicion, let both sides join in creating a new endeavor, not a new balance of power, but a new world of law, where the strong are just and the weak secure and the peace preserved. All this will not be finished in the first 100 days. Nor will it be finished in the first 1,000 days, nor in the life of this administration, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet. But let us begin. In your hands, my fellow citizens, more than mine, will rest the final success or failure of our course. Since this country was founded, each generation of Americans has been summoned to give testimony to its national loyalty. The graves of young Americans who answered the call to service surround the globe. Now the trumpet summons us again -- not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need -- not as a call to battle, though embattled we are -- but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle, year in and year out, ""rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation"" -- a struggle against the common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease and war itself. Can we forge against these enemies a grand and global alliance, North and South, East and West, that can assure a more fruitful life for all mankind? Will you join in that historic effort? In the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger. I do not shrink from this responsibility -- I welcome it. I do not believe that any of us would exchange places with any other people or any other generation. The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it -- and the glow from that fire can truly light the world. And so, my fellow Americans: Ask not what your country can do for you -- ask what you can do for your country. My fellow citizens of the world: Ask not what America will do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of man. Finally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world, ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you. With a good conscience our only sure reward, with history the final judge of our deeds, let us go forth to lead the land we love, asking his blessing and his help, but knowing that here on Earth God's work must truly be our own.","John F.

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- In the movie ""Law Abiding Citizen,"" Gerard Butler plays a man who loses his family when his wife and daughter are raped and murdered. After the main culprit receives a light sentence as part of a plea bargain and gets released from prison much sooner than he should have, our hero goes all ""Death Wish"" on the creep. He kidnaps him, drugs him and surgically dissects him into two-dozen pieces. Vengeance is wrong and can't be condoned. But when you're caught up in the tension of the film, it looks like something else: justice. In any case, I wouldn't be surprised if, throughout San Diego County, video stores are having trouble keeping that movie on the shelf. For the last 10 days, 3.2 million people have been working through a collective sense of fury and sorrow and more fury over two gruesome discoveries and one depressing revelation. The discoveries came when authorities found -- within days of each other -- the bodies of two teenage girls, 17-year-old Chelsea King of Poway, California, and 14-year-old Amber Dubois of Escondido, California. King had gone for an afternoon run in a local park a few days earlier. Dubois had vanished a year earlier while walking to school. John Albert Gardner III, a convicted sex offender, is charged with murdering King. A preliminary hearing for Gardner, who is also ""a focus of the investigation"" into the death of Dubois, has been scheduled for August 4. San Diego County District Attorney Bonnie Dumanis has said that Gardner is eligible for the death penalty but she hasn't decided if she will seek it. The revelation, as more details surface about Gardner and his history with the criminal justice system, is that the system for dealing with repeat sex offenders and child predators is, in California and probably other states as well, beyond broken. A wounded and grieving community wants to know why someone like Gardner, a known sex offender, was not still sitting in a jail cell after an earlier offense or at least under some kind of monitored electronic supervision. People want to know how it is that Gardner -- who was sentenced to six years in prison in 2000 for molesting, beating and falsely imprisoning a 13-year-old girl but eventually served only five years and three years on parole -- was apparently able to move freely and do as he pleased. Supposedly, Gardner was being monitored by the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, for whatever that's worth, and it might not be worth all that much. The Associated Press reported yesterday that Gardner violated his parole by moving too close to a school but was allowed to remain free, according to parole records obtained by the news agency. The records also show several other violations. Had Gardner been returned to prison, he would have been evaluated for commitment to a state mental hospital as a sexually violent predator and qualified for wearing an electronic tracking device for the rest of his life. We may never know what parole officers observed and concluded when they observed Gardner on the outside. Corrections officials claim that his ""field file"" was destroyed under a department policy that requires documents be destroyed within one year after a person's release from parole. This smells fishy. Here you have a state agency known for backlogs and inefficiency and, yet, in this case, it miraculously managed to summon the efficiency to destroy a file just when it was authorized to do so.  Color me suspicious. The media should keep digging until it finds out exactly when the file was destroyed, by whom, and under what authority. And if it comes out that the file was destroyed after the girls' bodies were found and Gardner was arrested, then watch out. Yet, even if corrections officials are telling the truth, this policy is a bad fit for repeat sex offenders who tend to, by definition, repeat their crimes. In most cases, according to the research, it's only a matter of time. So why destroy the file? Chances are that you're going to need it again sooner or later. To his credit, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, upon learning of this outrageous practice, got the chance to be a real-life action hero when he ordered the California Department of Corrections to stop destroying the field files. Score one for the good guys. There will be more victories to come. Reform activists -- under the leadership of Assemblyman Nathan Fletcher, who represents the cities where King and Dubois lived -- have started what could turn out to be a national crusade to change the sex offender laws, close the loopholes and increase penalties in order to keep our children safe. Maybe where we're headed is something like ""One and You're Done"" where, if you're convicted of sexually assaulting a child, you go away for 25 years. Or maybe those on parole should wear an electronic bracelet for life that is programmed to sound an alarm when the parolee goes near a park or a school. Everything is on the table, Fletcher said at a news conference this week. Because we remain a compassionate society, there will always be those who say that sexual predators are sick and that what they really need is treatment. They're half right. Monsters like John Albert Gardner III who prey on children are sick. But they can't be cured. So what they need, on the first offense, is to be put away for a long time -- or, if subject to the death penalty, to be put down.

"New York (CNN) -- Even though the American elections won't be decided until the polls close tonight, the Irish bookies late last week started paying off bettors who predicted Republicans would win a majority in the House of Representatives. And they stopped making new bets. That's a pretty definite statement! Although I am very confident my party (Republican) will win the House, I usually like to wait until the voters have voted before taking any victory laps. Many of my pundit friends have had a field day attempting to analyze, over the last several weeks, the early voting patterns of those of you who have cast ballots already and argue what it all means. I have always been more concerned with the late counting of votes rather than the early voting. And because so many races are so close, this is one election in which every vote can matter. Follow the latest on the election at CNN's Election Center . There is an old saying in the business: ""We only hold elections to see if the pollsters are right!"" And if the pollsters are right, it will be a big night for Republicans and a lot of second-guessing at the White House. Certainly viewers will know some trends and results shortly after the polls close. But in other cases, it will be late Tuesday and maybe even sometime Wednesday before we know the final results -- particularly in the Senate, where key Western races may alter the final outcome. Here is what's at stake: There are 37 Senate races being contested (19 Democratic and 18 Republican). Fourteen of those seats are open, meaning either the incumbent is not running for re-election or has been defeated in a primary. In order to win a Senate majority, Republicans have to hold Alaska and all their  open seats: New Hampshire, Kentucky, Ohio, Florida, Missouri, Utah and Kansas. And they must win 10 Democratic seats. If any of the Republican seats go to Democrats, the Democrats will continue to hold the majority. Everyone has all but conceded two Democratic open seats: the North Dakota seat will be won by Republican Gov. John Hoeven, and the Indiana open seat is likely to be won by former Sen. Dan Coats, also a Republican. More opinion on the election . The most vulnerable Democrats running for re-election are Sens. Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas; Russell Feingold of Wisconsin; and Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate majority leader. The Nevada election is the most heavily watched race in the country, and it has been neck and neck in the polls. Reid's opponent is Sharron Angle, a Tea Party-backed candidate and former Republican state legislator. This race has gone back and forth, but Angle took a narrow lead going into the final weekend after surviving millions of dollars of negative advertisements. If she wins, this will be the biggest story of the night. The next best chances for Republican gains are the Illinois, Pennsylvania and West Virginia open seats. The West Virginia Senate race between Democratic Gov. Joe Manchin and businessman John Raese has been a back-and-forth contest. If Raese upsets the popular governor, Republicans are in the chase to make the Senate very close. Other vulnerable Democrats are Sens. Michael Bennet of Colorado, Patty Murray of Washington and Barbara Boxer of California. Here is what's happening in the House: All 435 seats are up, and 43 seats are open (20 Democrats and 23 Republicans are not running for re-election). In the present Congress, there are 256 Democrats and 179 Republicans. Two seats are vacant. CNN has systematically chosen 100 congressional races to focus on. Fifty are viewed as the most competitive. Four of these are Republican and the rest Democratic. They have listed another 50 House races to watch. Five of these are Republican and the rest Democratic. This is a far larger number than in most midterm elections, but all of these races have shown signs they are competitive. Republicans must win 39 seats to win the majority. If early in the evening, Democratic incumbents start losing in the early returns from states such as New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Florida, then it is likely the trend predicted for Republicans to gain a majority in the House will come true. There are 16 vulnerable seats in those four states and another 11 on the watch list. If at the end of the night you see that either the dean of the House -- John Dingell of Michigan who has been in Congress since 1955 -- or Barney Frank of Massachusetts has lost, then you know it's been a historic election. That sums up the congressional and Senate races, but many states have other contests, including 37 governors' races (19 Democrats, 17 Republicans and one independent up for election). Twenty-four are open seats. Republicans are expected to easily end up with a majority of governors. Across the country, there are 6,118 state legislative seats also being contested, along with 160 ballot measures in 37 states. Tune in for what should be an exciting evening. But most of all, go vote! The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ed Rollins.","Rollins: Irish bookies already paid bettors who predicted GOP would win House majority .

"(CNN) -- There's Rudolph and Frosty, the Grinch and Charlie... Ralphie, George Bailey, Clark Griswold and Buddy. But do you recall the geekiest holiday specials and movies of all? For those looking for a change of pace from the traditional holiday fare on TV this season, here are some suggestions for programming that's traditional in certain households of the, shall we say, nerdier variety. Some of them are regularly seen on cable, others are extremely rare, but all of them are cult classics. ""The Star Wars Holiday Special"" This is the granddaddy of them all. Debuting on CBS in November 1978, and subsequently never aired on television again, it survived thanks to a few early adopters of the VCR and was passed from fan to fan through the years. Some might have thought it was a legend until they laid their eyes on it the first time. The story centers on Chewbacca's family - whom, you might remember, don't speak English - as they prepare to celebrate the Kashyyyk holiday of ""Life Day."" Guest stars including Bea Arthur, Art Carney and Harvey Korman (in multiple roles!) show up, as well as the movie's cast of Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher. At one point, Fisher sings the ""lyrics"" to the ""Star Wars"" theme. There's also a notorious scene where Diahann Carroll sings to Chewie's father, Itchy. For all of its campy appeal, there's also an animated portion which introduces fan favorite Boba Fett, and it's quite good. At the same time, if you're not a big fan of ""Star Wars,"" chances are you'll have trouble sitting through the entire two hours, 1970s commercials and all. ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" It's no secret that stop-motion animation and the holidays naturally seem to go together (witness the most recent episode of NBC's ""Community"" ), and this won't be the last one of those on the list. In 1993, Tim Burton unveiled his creation of ""Halloween Town,"" a world of ghouls ruled by Jack Skellington, who accidentally found himself in Christmas Town and immediately had to find out more about it, studying it like a science experiment --- even turning it into an equation. The movie, which originally wasn't released under the Walt Disney Pictures banner because of its dark nature, made a respectable $50 million at the box office. In the years since, it gained a cult following, and slowly, the Disney theme park and merchandising machine began to embrace it (it takes over the ""Haunted Mansion"" every holiday season at Disneyland). It's also been re-released in theaters twice in 3-D. ""Claymation Christmas Celebration"" CBS executives probably envisioned an entire special devoted to the California Raisins, a big sensation in 1987. Instead, ""claymation"" master Will Vinton gave them a show hosted by, well, two geeky dinosaurs, introducing new takes on classic Christmas carols. Our hosts couldn't agree on the meaning of the term ""wassail"" throughout the proceedings. The special went on to win an Emmy, and yes, the raisins showed up at the end to sing the Temptations' version of ""Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer."" But, for my money, the highlight is ""Carol of the Bells,"" which would have easily fit in as a ""Looney Tunes"" cartoon (the stunning animation on ""Joy to the World"" a close second). If this doesn't get you in the holiday spirit, I don't know what will. ""Batman Returns"" Continuing on the Tim Burton theme, we have this sequel from 1992, which, despite its summer release, actually took place during the holidays. This one will start fights among comic book fans. Most will agree that Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman was just about perfect. But for every supporter of the film, there's another who thinks that a movie where Batman is essentially playing ""third fiddle"" is not a Batman movie at all. Either way, it's probably the only holiday-themed movie where someone's nose is bitten off. ""Christmas Comes to PacLand"" In the early 1980s, Saturday morning cartoons took notice of the video game craze and did several mostly-forgettable series based on them. The king of them all was ""Pac-Man,"" and ABC even went so far as to create this holiday special. As one might imagine, Santa Claus has a little trouble with his sleigh, and crash-lands in Pac-Land. Pac-Man and his family use power pellets to help him continue his Christmas mission, while fending off ghosts led by the evil Mezmaron. But of course. (Check this one out on Cartoon Network's Boomerang! --- which, like CNN, is a Time Warner company --- during Christmas weekend). ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians""/""Santa Claus"" (1959) For out-and-out cheese, ""Pac-Land"" and the ""Star Wars Holiday Special"" have nothing on this, what may be the first holiday-themed sci-fi movie. A mainstay in late-night syndication and on cable throughout the holidays for decades, it seems that the children of Mars are in need of a little holiday merriment, so the Martians kidnap Santa, along with some innocent bystander Earth kids. Much goofiness ensues. In recent years, many have preferred seeing this one getting the ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" treatment -- the cult comedy show riffed on it in the early 1990s. This movie was so popular with fans that some of the original ""MST3K"" crew did it again in 2008, with new riffs on the movie as part of ""Cinematic Titanic."" Then there's the truly bizarre ""Santa Claus"" from Mexico, in which Santa has to fight off one of the devil's minions (who spends most of the movie prancing about in his red makeup and tights), while keeping a close watch on all the children of the world, using advanced spying methods, such as a disturbing eye telescope. The poor dubbing adds to the whole affair, and Santa's laughter comes off as just creepy (not to mention his mechanized reindeer). It, too, was given the ""Mystery Science Theater"" treatment in the show's fifth season. ""Futurama"" All of the holiday episodes --- including this year's --- have been hugely entertaining, and all of them have featured the robotic Santa Claus, who goes on a rampage every year because of a glitch that caused him to believe almost everyone on earth to be naughty. New additions through the years have included Kwanzaabot and Chanukah Zombie. ""Pee-wee's Playhouse Christmas Special"" When you think of nerds in the 1980s, you probably think of ""Revenge of the Nerds,"" Ed Grimley or Pee-wee Herman. Pee-wee's 1988 Christmas special was truly one of the weirdest ever, even weirder than most episodes of his Saturday morning show. Featuring everyone from Oprah to Charro, from Cher to Grace Jones, and from Frankie to Annette, the plot goes something like this: Pee-wee is generally a jerk to everyone on Christmas and keeps receiving fruit cakes, which he turns into a new wing of the Playhouse. Another one that's probably only worth seeing if you're a fan. ""Gremlins"" Not the first movie you would think about during the holidays, but it's been ranked on many ""best holiday movie"" lists by film geeks over the years. If you were anywhere in the '80s, you probably know the story of Gizmo, the mogwai who multiplied when exposed to water, and whose offspring became the grotesque gremlins when fed after midnight. They proceed to wreak havoc throughout the town at Christmas time, and the movie is still a lot of fun more than 25 years later. ""The Year Without a Santa Claus""/""'Twas the Night Before Christmas"" You can't have this list without a little Rankin-Bass, now can you? the production company was, after all, behind the best-known adaptation of ""The Hobbit,"" prior to the upcoming movie, and of course the well-known ""Rudolph"" and ""Frosty"" specials. 1974's ""The Year Without a Santa Claus"" is a real favorite among the hard-core aficionados of its stop-motion specials. You've got the Heat Miser, the Snow Miser, plus the two elves, Jingle and Jangle. What's not to love? Rankin-Bass was riding high in 1974, because it also put out the hand-drawn ""'Twas the Night"" the same year. Here, Father Mouse's geeky son, Albert, learns the true meaning of Christmas after writing Santa to tell him he didn't exist. Ouch. ""A Wish for Wings that Work"" Now here's a real obscurity. Based on Berkeley Breathed's ""Outland"" comic strip, nerdy penguin Opus only has one wish for Christmas (see the title). ""Peanuts,"" ""Garfield"" and other comic strip series had made beloved TV specials, but ""Outland"" was certainly the first one to come to mind for a new one. It probably didn't hurt that it was from Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment. It had excellent animation and surprise voices supplied by Robin Williams and Dustin Hoffman. (Again, it probably didn't hurt to have the Spielberg connection.) ""He-Man and She-Ra: A Christmas Special"" The last one on this list is far from the least. Here, earth children teach the denizens of Eternia and Etheria all about their holiday of Christmas. Most amazingly, these little moppets even melt the evil Skeletor's heart. It's also notable for the appearance of some ""Transformers""-esque characters who seem shoehorned in. The ending, however, is worth the price of admission, when the kids tell their parents all about where they've been. Whether you prefer to spend the season with Jack Skellington, Pac-Man or Pee-wee Herman, there's probably something in this list for you. Happy holidays!","Nerdy holiday favorites star Pac-Man, Pee-wee and Chewbacca .

"(Rolling Stone) -- It would be impossible to list the Oscar-worthy performances of 2010 without highlighting Javier Bardem in ""Biutiful."" Mexican director Alejandro González Iñárritu (""Babel,"" ""21 Grams,"" ""Amores Perros"") describes Uxbal, the character Bardem embodies in flesh and spirit, as ""devoted father, tormented lover, mystified son, underground businessman, ghost seeker, spiritual sensitive, consumer-goods pirate, guilty conscience and urban survivor."" The 10 Best Movies of 2010 . All of this and more can be seen on Bardem's indelibly expressive face.

"(Rolling Stone) -- It could have been a bunch of pip-pip, stiff-upper-lip Brit blather about a stuttering king who learns to stop worrying and love the microphone. Instead, ""The King's Speech"" -- a crowning achievement powered by a dream cast -- digs vibrant human drama out of the dry dust of history. King George VI (Colin Firth) -- father of the present Queen Elizabeth -- found his own Dr. Strangelove in Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), a wildly eccentric Australian speech therapist who made it possible for the stammering monarch to go on radio in 1939 and rally his subjects to support the declaration of war on Hitler's Germany. Rolling Stone: Peter Travers reviews ""The King's Speech"" in his weekly video series, ""At the Movies With Peter Travers"" ""The King's Speech"" plays out on the battlefield of words, not action. Writer David Seidler (doing keenly insightful work partly owing to his own bouts with a stammer) had conceived the story first as a play. Before you can think the words ""static"" and ""confining,"" be advised that director Tom Hooper, garlanded with Emmy dust for ""John Adams,"" ""Elizabeth I,"" ""Longford"" and ""Prime Suspect,"" breathes fresh, urgent life into every frame of this powerhouse. Hooper, 37, is a prodigious talent. The emotion this film produces is staggering. Hooper begins in 1925, as the king, then merely Prince Albert, is trying to speak at the British Empire Exhibition. The words stick in his throat, and his silences between syllables fill the stadium. The prince's embarrassment is acute, and deeply felt by his compassionate wife, Elizabeth (a superb Helena Bonham Carter creates miracles with every subtle look and gesture), who goads him to visit Logue. His Highness goes into heavy snob mode in the presence of this commoner, who demands that they use first names. When Lionel first calls Albert ""Bertie,"" Firth's poleaxed reaction is priceless. Lionel treats speech lessons like therapy sessions, pushing for details about life in the royal family. What he gets is a portrait of a blowhard father, George V (Michael Gambon), and a taunting brother, Edward VIII (Guy Pearce is absolutely stellar), who reduces the proud, vulnerable Albert to rubble by committing the one unforgivable sin: Edward abdicates the throne to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson (Eve Best), leaving Bertie to succeed him. Suddenly, the man who would not be king most assuredly is. Rolling Stone: Peter Travers' holiday movie preview: Ten movies for escapism this season . Firth's nuanced brilliance is a thing of bruised beauty. Oscar-nominated last year for ""A Single Man,"" he gives a towering performance that deserves a shower of awards. And Rush is his match, fiercely funny in the hilarious and heartfelt interactions between king and commoner. Lionel is a failed actor given to grand gestures, and Rush chows down on this feast of a role, jolting the movie to life. Firth plays the counterpoint, the blue blood bred to hold it all together. It's uproarious to watch Lionel prod Bertie to lose his cool, forcing him to sing out a symphony of s**t-f***-b***er-me swearing (all stammer-free). Luckily, this release takes place in Lionel's home, where his wife and children are unaware of the royal patient. The scene in which Lionel's wife, Myrtle (Jennifer Ehle), meets the king has a special poignancy, if you remember Ehle and Firth as lovers in TV's ""Pride and Prejudice."" ""The King's Speech"" doesn't have the budget to show coronations and pomp, but it misses nothing in resonant intimacy. Hooper, with a Brit father and Aussie mother, throws himself into the scene in which Lionel stands like a conductor in front of the king as he delivers the speech of his life. Two men alone create an epic landscape of feeling in one of the very best movies of the year. Rolling Stone grade: 3 1/2 stars .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama has accomplished some extraordinary things but can he really shoot down a fighter jet? The F-22 Raptor is the most expensive jet fighter ever built. The plane is the F-22 Raptor, a supersonic stealth marvel that looks like it's flown straight out of a Hollywood action film. It is being built for the U.S. Air Force, boasting the most advanced technology in the sky. ""You talk to any aviator in the world, ask what they would like to fly, and if they don't say the F-22 then they are lying,"" U.S. Major Derek Routt told The Atlantic magazine. ""I would kill to fly it."" The U.S. government has ordered nearly 200 of them, even as the price has rocketed to more than $350 million each, making the Lockheed Martin/Boeing F-22 the most expensive fighter ever built. But it's never been used in combat and it's not clear when it will be. The U.S. simply doesn't face any enemies with planes advanced enough to bother sending out an F-22. ""The reality is we are fighting two wars, in Iraq and Afghanistan,"" Defense Secretary Robert Gates said, ""and the F-22 has not performed a single mission in either theater."" Gates doesn't want any more of them. Obama, who campaigned for the presidency criticizing what he considers wasteful military spending, doesn't either. Is the F-22 essential military spending or a waste of money? Sound Off below . But it's the U.S. Congress that actually funds the military. A lot of its members want to see more F-22s taking off, to keep the U.S. air force ahead of potential rivals and protect thousands of factory jobs across the country. ""We need to maintain that air superiority,"" said Congressman Phil Gingrey, whose district is home to the main F-22 assembly line. ""This is not just about 2,200 jobs, although with the economy as it is, and all these job losses, it's kind of preposterous to think that this administration would close (them) down."" The Armed Services Committee of the House of Representatives has voted to order a dozen more planes. But the full Congress would still have to vote and Obama would have to sign the legislation. He says he will veto it instead.

"(CNN) -- It was 1981, and Cindy Morgan was filming what she was told would be a half-live-action, half-cartoon for Walt Disney Pictures on a completely black movie set. The director, Steve Lisberger, came up to her and told her that she was going to be flying a ""solar sailer"" ship, and at another point, she would cross a bridge -- two things that she didn't see in front of her. ""I asked him, 'What the hell is going on?' and he showed me these great Syd Mead graphics,"" Morgan said. Mead, an industrial designer, was in charge of special effects for the movie, called ""Tron."" It would be the first time that an entire world was created with computer animation. Twenty-eight years later, the movie, which cost a reported $17 million to make, has spawned a sequel, ""Tron: Legacy,"" with a much larger budget. What is it about this movie -- considered a box office flop at the time (it made $33 million, according to boxofficemojo.com) -- that made fans at the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con go wild to get a surprise look at ""Legacy"" test footage? Interest has certainly remained high through the years. ""Wherever I would go in the world, no matter what language they spoke, the word 'Tron' would come up,"" said Bruce Boxleitner, who played the character of Tron and returns in the sequel. ""The computer culture was just starting up when we did 'Tron.' There was no internet,"" said Jeff Bridges, star of both films. ""I think [the fans are] guys who were raised on video games, and have a fondness for it."" You could certainly say that iReporter David Fike has a fondness for the ""Tron"" video game. ""Anytime I went anywhere with a 'Tron' arcade game, I was begging my parents for quarters,"" he said. Decades later, Fike owns an arcade console of his own, purchased at an auction. ""It had been in a Wal-Mart for most of its life and had some nicks and scratches,"" he said. ""I'm trying to restore the cabinet and get it as close as I can to making it look somewhat new."" And, of course, the movie has a special place in his heart. ""This was the first movie inside of a video game, so something sparked the imagination and fascinated me. It's probably still my favorite movie of all time despite how badly people reflect on it now,"" he said. Fike theorizes that, ""It was so different, and so ahead of its time that people just didn't get it."" Most people even somewhat familiar with the original movie remember the suits worn by characters inside the computer. ""The costumes were unbearable, there was no eating lunch in those things,"" Morgan said. Even so, the original movie's suits are a favorite among fans, no more so than iReporter Jay Maynard, who -- wearing the iconic suit -- gained fame online and on shows like ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" and ""Tosh.0"" as ""Tron Guy."" ""What got me interested at the time the original came out was that I had just begun working as a mainframe systems programmer,"" Maynard said. ""I had always been interested in computers. This was the first time anyone tried showing what went on inside a computer."" Maynard isn't alone in being inspired by the movie in that way. At conventions, Morgan said she constantly encounters fans who got into computer programming because of ""Tron."" Fellow iReporter Joe Machos, a data processor at an insurance company at the time (not unlike one of the computer programs in the movie), saw the movie on opening day, July 9, 1982. ""I left that theater, as one might say, rapt,"" he said. ""It had taken me to another place."" He noted how, with its use of terms like RAM, ""rezzing,"" and ""end of line,"" it was far ahead of its time. ""It accurately predicted a future. We now have this thing called cyberspace. When you say that now, it resonates with people."" Machos also is a hard-core fan of all things Disney. During a trip to Disney's Tomorrowland, he left a comment with a woman who worked there asking, ""Where's 'Tron?'"" According to Machos, she asked him, ""Wasn't that a box office failure?"" Machos then pointed to an image from ""Fantasia"" -- which didn't make a profit until more than 25 years after its release -- saying, ""That was, too."" With the imminent release of the sequel, fans have been clamoring for a Blu-ray version of the original, which is quite difficult to find on DVD (Netflix's spokesperson said that the 2002 anniversary release is on ""moratorium""). According to Disney, earlier DVD releases are simply out of circulation and a Blu-ray version that Lisberger is personally overseeing will be available early next year. ""What I think Disney is doing is smart,"" said Machos, who thinks it's a good idea to re-establish ""Tron"" for a new generation. Aside from the technological, early cyberpunk aspects of ""Tron"" and other themes (Morgan sees a spiritual component to it; both films have something of a religious subtext), another explanation for its long-standing appeal is that the production design was unlike anything seen before. ""The recognizers, those giant staple looking things, I thought those were crazy cool,"" said iReporter Steve Hungsberg. ""I saw the new movie being promoted at Comic-Con and I bought one of each of the recognizer toys there. I also got one for my son. The recognizer was by far the coolest."" Fike hopes that ""Tron: Legacy"" will continue that tradition. ""I hope the disc battles are as epic as everyone that's already seen it is saying."" Just before catching a sneak preview of the movie, Maynard said, ""Everything that I've seen about the new film has impressed me immensely."" No matter the reason, there's just something about ""Tron."" As Morgan put it, ""Technology was no longer something dull and dry, technology became magical. That's the secret of 'Tron.'""","Fan anticipation is high for ""Tron: Legacy""

"(CNN) -- Billy Taylor, one of the most influential American jazz musicians of the second half of the twentieth century, died Tuesday at the age of 89, according to a statement posted on his official Web site. Taylor passed away in New York due to heart failure, his daughter Kim Taylor-Thompson noted in the statement. Over the course his career, Taylor composed more than 350 songs, including ""I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free,"" an unofficial anthem of the civil rights movement. He created his own record label -- ""Taylor Made"" -- in 1989, according to the statement. His last two recordings were released in the late 1990s on another Taylor label, ""Soundpost Records."" Taylor, who grew up in Washington, D.C., started as a professional piano player in 1944. He initially made his mark on New York's 52nd Street with Ben Webster's Quartet. He shared the stage at the famous Birdland club with a host of other jazz greats, including Miles Davis and Dizzy Gillespie, the statement noted.

"(CNN) -- Lawyers for the mother of a 15-year-old girl suing ""The Tyra Show"" lambasted the show's producers Tuesday as ""reckless"" for letting her child appear as a self-described sex addict. The girl's mother, Beverly McClendon, filed a lawsuit earlier this month in U.S. District Court in Atlanta, Georgia. Her suit contends the show never got valid written consent and an employment certificate, which must be obtained in Georgia before a minor can be ""employed as a performer in a television production ... [and] the minor will not be used for pornographic purposes."" McClendon's lawyers said Tuesday the consent form that ""The Tyra Show"" received was clearly forged by the daughter, Jewel Ciera Washington. After being contacted by Washington, the show's staff called her cell phone and arranged for her to fly from Atlanta to New York and appear on the now-defunct program. Its last air date was May 28. ""You had an infatuated child who would do anything,"" attorney George Lawson told HLN's Jean Velez-Mitchell, explaining that the teenager doctored the consent form because she admired and wanted to meet Tyra Banks, the longtime model and TV personality. The lawsuit, which seeks $3 million, contends that ""The Tyra Show"" used Washington's appearance to further its main goal of boosting ratings and, thus, bringing in advertising revenue. On the show, which aired in October 2009, Washington claimed she lost her virginity at 9 and had gotten pregnant three times -- claims that she now says weren't true, according to her lawyers. ""It's like I'm trapped in a dark place with no light shining down, like I'm a prisoner,"" Washington said on the TV show. ""I know that I need help for this. ... I know it for a fact,"" she added. Attorney Wanda Jackson said that by publicizing Washington's alleged struggles with sex addiction, the program publicly exploited a teenage girl who confessed to having a serious problem. And it did so, she claims, without properly finding out whether the minor had her parent's permission to appear. ""It's dangerous,"" said Jackson, who is representing McClendon with Lawson. ""If you thought she had that kind of problem, why would you put her on television?"" The defendants have not answered the complaint. No court date has been set. Scott Rowe, senior vice president of worldwide communications for Warner Bros. Television Group, declined to comment last week to CNN Entertainment. Warner Bros. Entertainment, one of the defendants in McClendon's lawsuit, is a division of Time Warner, which is the parent company of CNN. In Session's Adam Blank contributed to this report.","Lawyers say ""The Tyra Show"" was ""reckless"" in letting a teenage girl on the show .

"(CNN) -- Join Roland Martin for his weekly sound-off segment on CNN.com Live at 11:10 a.m. Wednesday. If you're passionate about politics, he wants to hear from you. Roland Martin says voting on Tuesday made sense when the day was set in 1845, but a change is needed. Now that the political parties have informally settled on their nominees, the focus turns to November 4, when the nation will go to the polls to choose a new president. But why is Election Day on a Tuesday? Why in the world do we continue to insist on voting on a weekday when we are supposed to be encouraging as many people to vote as possible? Most of the primaries and caucuses during the past four months took place on Tuesdays, but a number went to the polls on Saturdays. The Puerto Rico vote was on a Sunday. What's better than going to church in the morning and then making your way to the voting booth? Officially, Election Day is the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November (depending on the year, it could be November 2 through November 8). Since 1845, this has been the standard practice in the United States. Congress wanted a set date to elect a president and members of Congress, and because we were an agricultural society, this was the best day for farmers in rural America to get to the polls. That made a ton of sense. Then. But a lot has changed in the past 163 years, and it's time Congress changed this unnecessary law. The purists are likely to argue that everyone knows that a Tuesday in early November is set aside for Election Day. So with that in mind, just leave the election in November. Sure, it would make better sense to go with a month during which it's warm in nearly all of the USA, but the consistency argument also makes sense. But why not the first Saturday in November? If that date were chosen, the majority of voters wouldn't have to worry about trying to vote before going to work, hoping and praying the lines aren't too long so they can zip in and zip out. The same thing happens in the evening. Folks have to hurry up and finish their work, interrupt meetings, and shut down whatever else they are doing and head to the polls. They are likely to confront long lines, and that discourages some folks from voting. (Now, I don't have much sympathy on this one. We'll stand in line for a concert or movie; and that surely isn't as important as electing a president!) Saturday is already a day of leisure, and there is no doubt that more Americans would head to the polls on a traditional day off from work. Because of the excitement generated by this year's campaign, you can bet there will be long lines at the polls, and if there are not enough ballots, we can expect all kinds of delays. Folks will grow frustrated, be afraid to show up to work late, and likely will leave and not come back. That's just not good for democracy. This is one of those simple decisions that doesn't require a ton of debate. I can't imagine there being major opposition to moving the election date. In 2004, 71 percent of all eligible voters were registered, according to a story by the Carnegie Reporter, ""Election Reform: Lessons From 2004."" But of that number, 60.7 percent voted. Someone is likely to say that with the number of people voting up in 2004 from the number in 2000, that's not bad. But when we see 90 percent of voters in Iraq voting -- and we are trying to instill democracy there! -- it's clear that impediments to voting in the United States aren't helpful. It would be nice to see the presidential nominees weigh in on this and pledge to change the election date. Let's see a debate moderator ask this question. Instead of putting up barriers for people who want to vote, we should be the most open society when it comes to giving our citizens as many options as possible to vote, and moving Election Day from a weekday to a weekend makes a lot of sense. We can't speak of our cherished democracy around the world if we aren't willing to improve it every chance we get. Roland S. Martin is a nationally award-winning journalist and CNN contributor.

"(CNN) -- Fans of Harry Potter have a lot to talk about this morning. After months of updates to trailers, a stream of released stills and interviews with Emma Watson, Rupert Grint and Daniel Radcliffe, fans across the country have finally seen the beginning of the end. Review: Latest 'Harry Potter' shows age . As they shake off the effects of a late night at the theater, the euphoria of the line parties subsides and the inevitable struggle settles in: Did ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1"" do justice to J.K. Rowling's final installation of the series? ""I hope they do a good job on Dobby's death scene,"" said Traci Dammann, 34,  before the midnight showing in Atlanta, Georgia, on Thursday. ""It really moved me in the book."" Dammann, founder of a Harry Potter fan group in Atlanta, was also worried about how the film would portray Hermione's torture scene at Malfoy mansion. ""I just want it to be done how I imagined it, and correctly,"" she said. ""It was gut-wrenching when I read it, and I want it to be gut-wrenching on the screen."" Fans of the seven-book series chronicling a young wizard's coming-of-age in a fantastic and dangerous, magical world have a lot of emotion invested in the franchise. In many cases, they grew up reading the books, and for the past 10 years they've watched the actors portraying Harry Potter and his friends grow up themselves in seven big screen adaptations from Warner Brothers. Warner Brothers, like CNN, is owned by Time Warner. But also, for the last decade, Harry Potter fans have been disappointed by what plot points were left out of the movies and the inexplicable additions or director choices made when bringing the books to cinematic life. ""I think most people are pretty happy with the way [the movies] turned out, but all fans that I have talked to have problems with the movies,"" Dammann said. ""Harry's eyes in the movie are blue and ... in the books they're green,"" she said. ""This is a huge thing to a lot of the fans because they're just so invested."" Spoiler alert: ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1"" has an already well-publicized additional scene, featuring Harry Potter and Hermione Granger slow-dancing -- a nod to fans who have long wondered if the two should be more than friends. The answer, decidedly played in the film, is ""no."" Long 'Harry Potter' movie clip leaked . Other plot points fans are concerned about being translated ""correctly"" include the emotional death scenes of Mad-Eye Moody and Hedwig, Harry Potter's beloved owl, as well as the professor Snape backstory. ""When you get to 'The Deathly Hallows,' you've really kind of shot yourself in the foot if you don't have enough of that, because it's a major plot [development],"" said Cleolinda Jones, a blogger and author of ""Movies in Fifteen Minutes."" Harry Potter fans are not alone in their angst. Other fantasy book series have become popular movie series, including ""Lord of the Rings,"" ""Twilight,"" and ""The Chronicles of Narnia."" Fans of those movies and books wrestle with the same kinds of frustrations. ""When 'The Fellowship' came out, some fans were horrified by the changes,"" said Pat Dawson, a senior staff member of TheOneRing.net, a J.R.R. Tolkein fan forum. ""One of the things they did with 'Lord of the Rings,' and I've heard they do this with 'Harry Potter,' too: [Filmmakers] think that there needs to be humor that wasn't there in the book,"" Dawson said. ""They also will emphasize romance that maybe wasn't there in the book,"" like with Arwen and Aragorn, she said. ""Tolkein pretty much left that out of the book completely."" ""But as the next two movies came out, there were even more changes, so people [ended up] looking back fondly on 'The Fellowship' as one of their favorites of the three movies because it was so true to the book,"" Dawson said. She said the Harry Potter movie franchise started to fall short of fan expectations with the third movie, ""The Prisoner of Azkaban."" iReport: Your reviews of ""Potter"" Because of a new director and such prolific source material, she felt it was not only difficult in this case to be as true to the book, but ""it was untrue to the book in a lot of ways that fans were horrified by."" Adding to the fan frustration is the fact that the Harry Potter movies are almost over.  The latest Harry Potter movie represents half of J.K. Rowling's 759-page series finale. The last movie adaptation -- ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2"" -- will be in theaters next summer. Knowing that the magical world they've enjoyed for well over a decade will be taking a bow from the big screen can be stressful and sad for fans. ""Twilight"" fans are at a turning point in that franchise's movie arc, too, Jones said. ""They have a very specific kind of anxiety,"" Jones said. That's because there's a key scene in ""Breaking Dawn,"" the fourth novel in Stephenie Meyer's series, that fans hope will not be taken the wrong way by mainstream audiences. The complicated scene involves the character Jacob -- the werewolf -- falling in love with Bella and Edward's halfling vampire baby.  Jones says the leaked scripts seem to indicate the scene is true to the book. So, what can fans do when their favorite fantasy franchise movies conclude? ""Look forward to all the extras on the extended editions,"" said Dawson, who has experienced a similar grieving process with the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies. ""Just really enjoy the last couple of movies. Just sit there and really get into them and enjoy the fandom and everything that comes from that."" Even with tribulations over plot changes and character portrayals, most fans of these fantasy franchises still feel compelled to see the movies and share in the excitement over any new release. ""It's seeing Harry Potter come to life,"" Dammann said. ""Even if there are parts that aren't perfect or aren't exactly what you want, there are so many things that are right.""","Movie adaptations can be frustrating to fans of fantasy book series, like Harry Potter .
Fans worry that filmmakers won't portray their favorite scenes correctly .
Still, fans say they enjoy seeing the book characters come to life ."

"(CNN) -- Like millions around the world, I owe my early career choices to the Beatles. As a 6-year-old, I stayed up ""late"" one Sunday night to watch the Fab Four explode onto the world stage on ""the Ed Sullivan Show."" There were the Saturday afternoons I walked to the Plaza Theater in downtown Glasgow, Kentucky, to watch ""Help!"" and ""A Hard Day's Night."" I thank Ringo for my love of percussion, which manifested itself via paint brushes and coffee cans until I could get real drums. Fast forward a number of years, and I was an honest-to-goodness musician, touring the world with a number of recording artists. I had a gold record on the wall. December 8, 1980, was an off day. On the road with jazz-grass fiddle wizard Vassar Clements, we were somewhere in Pennsylvania. We stayed the night there so a TV crew could follow us the next day as we arrived in New York for a series of shows. The hotel room TV was on ""Monday Night Football"" when the world changed. Sportscaster Howard Cosell told us that John Lennon had been shot and killed that night in New York. Share your own memories of that day . Our trip to New York took on a different meaning. It was dreary and rainy and cold the next morning as we drove toward the city. Fitting, really. After sound check, the road manager and I took the subway up to Columbus Circle and began walking up Central Park West toward the Dakota, the apartment building where John Lennon lived and where he was shot. As we walked along the sidewalk, it was like someone had thrown a sad, gray, wet blanket on the city. There was traffic on the streets, but the streets were quiet. There were people talking as they scurried, but the air was mute. And as we approached the Dakota, we noticed a flock of birds circling above the building. Not venturing anywhere. Just circling. As if they were standing guard, mourning. ""American Morning's"" John Roberts on Lennon . Then, from around the corner, we heard the serenade of ""Give Peace a Chance"" and ""Imagine"" from the hundreds of fellow fans. Some holding candles. Some holding flowers. All holding memories. We joined them. There was so much sadness that day, so many tears, yet it was overshadowed by peace and love and memories. And music. I'll never forget it. When my son was born in 1987, we named him Dakota. Some years later, I traded in life on a tour bus for a different seat, watching history. I traded in the recording studio control room for the CNN control room. Thirty years later, the Beatles, and John Lennon, live on. So does the music. So does the legacy. So does the hope -- that someday the world will give peace a chance. Imagine.","John Lennon died 30 years ago .

Refugio Aviarios del Caribe, Costa Rica (VBS.TV) -- Sloths are fantastically weird animals, the junkies of the jungle who seem to spend their lives either nodding off or scratching and occasionally eating a bean or two before drifting back to what looks like a blissful sleep. I've always been a fan of sloths. They're wonderfully freaky, yet perfectly adapted to their slow arboreal lifestyle. Their nerves have even evolved to react slower so they don't flinch at loud noises, making them nature's most chilled-out animals. They have very few natural predators and the only time they're vulnerable is when they leave the trees once a week and descend to the ground to poo. This behavior has befuddled scientists for many years. One of the theories is that their solitary lifestyle affords few chances to hook up with the opposite sex and these toilet stops are a good way to meet other sloths. See the rest of ""Sloths!"" at VBS.TV . But evolution didn't prepare sloths for the power lines and roads that now crisscross Costa Rica's jungles. The babies of mama sloths who have been run over or zapped by electricity wind up at the Aviaros del Caribe sanctuary in Costa Rica. It's the world's only sloth orphanage, home to more than 100 very sleepy urchins whose lives have been saved by legendary sloth whisperer Judy Arroyo. If you fall for these animals like I did then you can join the sanctuary's volunteer program. Trainee sloth wranglers get to feed the sloths and help exercise and potty train the babies. The sanctuary runs on donations and volunteers, so you can do your bit by helping these vulnerable creatures whose jungle home, some say, is being slowly destroyed by pesticides, sold off to U.S. real estate agencies, and sliced up by roads and power lines.","Sloths have very few natural predators .

"(RollingStone.com) -- ""Le Noise"" is Neil Young with eight new songs and no band, accompanying himself on guitars with maximum fuzz and electronics, manipulated by producer Daniel Lanois. The result is one of Young's weirdest studio records -- and that's saying something in a decade that includes the eco-opera ""Greendale"" and the chunky-rock songs about alternative fuel on ""Fork in the Road."" ""Le Noise"" is also the most intimate and natural-sounding album Young has made in a long time: just a songwriter making his way through a vividly rendered chaos of memoir, affection and fear. It's as if you hear the songs on the verge of creation, the way Young first hears rhyme and noise in his head. On his current tour, where Young has played most of these songs, you can buy a T-shirt that reads ""I Said Solo... They Said Acoustic."" Even with Lanois thickening and f---ing with the atmospheres, ""Le Noise"" is as solo as it gets. That is not obvious at first. ""Walk With Me"" opens with arguing layers of iron jangle that sound like they barged in from Metallica's ""Death Magnetic."" The last minute is muddy-guitar drone and beeping sound effects, like bits of Young's 1982 hippie-Kraftwerk fling, ""Trans,"" dropped into one of the Crazy Horse-freakout codas on 1991's ""Weld."" But earlier in the song, Young sings with chantlike force -- ""I feel your love/I feel your strong love/I feel the patience of unconditional love"" -- like he's testing variations on his theme. Then he gets specific: ""I lost some people I was traveling with/I miss the soul and the old friendship."" His voice is receding into the drone, but recent passings -- like those of his friends and collaborators Larry ""L.A."" Johnson and Ben Keith -- cut through the din like heartbreak. The reflection is strong here. The riff in ""Sign of Love"" has the repetitive charge of ""Cinnamon Girl""; there's some ""Mr. Soul"" in the guitar hook of ""Someone's Gonna Rescue You""; ""Hitchhiker"" is in the tradition of extended parables like ""Crime in the City"" -- images of a life unraveling and repaired that, at points, may be Young's (""Then came paranoia, and it ran away with me."") But the most personal thing about ""Le Noise"" is the sense of a restless master caught in the pursuit of ideas, shaping their expression. ""Peaceful Valley Boulevard,"" one of two acoustic-guitar songs, is a detailed American history lesson from Indian wars to electric cars. Yet in one line (""A mother screamed, and every soul was lost""), Young's voice cracks on the peak note -- an impulsive, moving flaw. And in ""Love and War,"" Young -- his creaky whisper and acoustic guitar buoyed by Lanois' watery treatments -- confesses an uncertainty hard to believe in one of rock's most driven stars: ""When I sing about love and war/I don't really know what I'm saying."" But then the conviction comes back. He only has that one way forward, through the music: ""I sang in anger, hit another bad chord/But I still try to sing about love and war."" ""Le Noise"" is, ultimately, an extreme simplicity: the sound of a man who won't give up.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Opponents of a bill that would overhaul the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act blocked consideration Thursday of the controversial bill until after the July 4 recess. Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wisconsin, says the FISA overhaul legislation is ""deeply flawed."" Senate Democratic leaders announced the delay because of a filibuster spearheaded by Sens. Russ Feingold, D-Wisconsin, and Chris Dodd, D-Connecticut. But the measure is expected to pass by a large margin with the support of both major parties' presumptive presidential nominees, Sen. Barack Obama and Sen. John McCain. Language that appears likely to let telecommunications companies escape lawsuits over the Bush administration's warrantless surveillance program has drawn sharp opposition from liberal Democrats such as Feingold and Dodd. ""I'm pleased we were able to delay a vote on FISA until after the July 4 holiday instead of having it jammed through,"" Feingold said. ""I hope that over the July 4 holiday, senators will take a closer look at this deeply flawed legislation and understand how it threatens the civil liberties of the American people. It is possible to defend this country from terrorists while also protecting the rights and freedoms that define our nation."" ""I'm pleased that consideration of the FISA Amendments Act has been delayed until after the 4th of July recess,"" Dodd said. ""I urge my colleagues to take this time to listen to their constituents and consider the dangerous precedent that would be set by granting retroactive immunity to the telecommunications companies that may have engaged in President Bush's illegal wiretapping program. ""When and if FISA does come back to the Senate floor, I will offer my amendment to strip the retroactive immunity provision out of the bill. I implore my colleagues to support the rule of law and join me in voting against retroactive immunity."" The House of Representatives voted last week to overhaul FISA, which requires a secret court to sign off on domestic electronic surveillance in intelligence cases. The law was passed in 1978 in response to Watergate-era wiretapping abuses. The Bush administration and the bill's supporters argue that modern technology requires that the law be updated to allow intelligence agencies to spy on phone or Internet traffic overseas that might be routed through switches in the United States. ""As telecommunications technology has changed, intelligence agencies have been presented with collection opportunities inside the United States against targets overseas,"" said Sen. Jay Rockefeller, the Democratic chairman of the Intelligence Committee. ""Yet because of the way FISA was written in 1978, they could not take full advantage of these new opportunities."" Supporters say the new bill requires court oversight of communications intercepts and will prevent presidents from launching another program like the one the Bush administration acknowledged in 2005. Obama, who had said he would oppose any bill that would toss out lawsuits against the phone companies, has said he will support the new proposal. He said it makes sure that in the future, ""somebody's watching the watchers."" ""Given that all the information that I've received is that the underlying program itself actually is important and useful to American security, as long as it has these constraints on them, I felt that it was more important for me to go ahead and support this compromise,"" Obama said Wednesday in Chicago, Illinois. President Bush acknowledged in 2005 that he ordered the secretive National Security Agency to intercept communications between U.S. residents and people overseas suspected of having ties to terrorism. The administration insists that the program was authorized when Congress approved military action against al Qaeda after the terrorist network's 2001 attacks. But Democrats and some leading Republicans in Congress say it violated FISA, which required intelligence agencies to get court approval before spying on Americans. The revelations led to several lawsuits against the phone companies that cooperated with the program by people who suspect they were targets of the wiretaps. The Bush administration has refused to share records of the program with federal courts, invoking a ""state secrets"" privilege.","Democratic Sens.

"VIENNA, Austria (CNN) -- Iran has accepted a draft agreement that calls for some uranium produced in Iran to be sent abroad for further enrichment, an Iranian diplomat said Wednesday. Mohamed ElBaradei says the agreement is a ""balanced"" approach to the problem. ""In principle we have in fact accepted this offer for this Tehran ... reactor in spite of the fact that we are capable of producing the fuel,"" Ali Asghar Soltanieh told CNN's Matthew Chance in Vienna. ""But we decided to welcome this offer in order not only to show our transparency and cooperation but prove that all activities are for exclusively peaceful purposes."" Soltanieh is Iran's ambassador to the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency. He spoke shortly after concluding three days of discussions at the IAEA's headquarters here with representatives from the U.N., France, Russia, and the United States. The draft agreement is ""the summary of the discussions that we have had"" since Monday, which Soltanieh described as ""elaborating on all aspects of this project for fuel for Tehran's reactor,"" Soltanieh said. He and the other representatives from France, Russia, and the United States are taking the draft agreement to their respective governments for approval. IAEA chief Mohamed ElBaradei has given all the representatives until Friday to say whether they will sign the agreement, which ElBaradei described as ""a balanced approach to the problem."" Soltanieh would not elaborate on the draft agreement until it is finalized, but he told CNN that Iran plans to continue its uranium enrichment program at its Bushehr nuclear power plant. The delegates hammered out the details of a tentative deal reached in early October which calls for low-enriched uranium produced in Iran to be sent abroad for further enrichment and then returned for use in medical research and treatment. Tehran says its nuclear program is intended solely for peaceful purposes. But many in the West believe Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons capabilities. The Obama administration is working on a substantial sanctions package against Iran in case current diplomatic efforts to curb its nuclear program fail, top officials told Congress earlier this month.

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- The Mexican military has arrested the son of a top drug cartel lieutenant, the government said Thursday. Authorities present suspect Vicente Zambada Niebla to the press Thursday in Mexico City. Vicente Zambada Niebla, known as ""El Vicentillo,"" was arrested Wednesday along with five subordinates, Mexico's defense department and attorney general's office said in a joint release. The men were acting suspiciously and had military-grade weapons, officials said. Zambada is the son of Ismael Zambada García, known as ""El Mayo."" The elder Zambada is a top lieutenant in the Sinaloa cartel, headed by Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, officials said. Senior defense official Luis Arturo Oliver Cen and Jose Ricardo Cabrera Gutierrez, a top official with an attorney general's task force on terrorism and security, announced the arrest in Mexico City. Guzman, the alleged cartel leader who escaped from a Mexican prison in 2001, was named in this year's Forbes magazine report on the world's billionaires. He ranked 701. Authorities on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border blame Sinaloa and other cartels for a surge in violence in the region. Mexican Attorney General Eduardo Medina Mora expressed outrage at Forbes for listing a major drug suspect. About 6,500 people died in the drug war in Mexico last year, Mexican President Felipe Calderon said last week. Defense official Oliver said authorities confiscated three rifles, three luxury automobiles, 67,480 pesos ($4,845) and $866 in U.S. currency. A video on the Universal newspaper Web site shows a dark-haired Zambada and other men being led away in handcuffs. Zambada sports long sideburns, beard stubble, a black sports coat and a striped shirt. CNN's Melanie Whitley contributed to this report from Atlanta, Georgia.","Vicente Zambada Niebla and five subordinates arrested, government says .

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: It's the best day of the school-week and you're about to get a front-row seat to world headlines without a single commercial. In other words, CNN Student News. I'm Carl Azuz! First Up: Arizona Shooting . AZUZ: First up: The giant American flag was recovered in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks in New York City. That was a little over nine years ago, the same day that Christina Green was born. She was one of the victims of a shooting last Saturday in Tucson, Arizona. So the flag was raised in Christina's honor with those who knew and loved the girl walking past it, on the way to a service to remember her. Five other people were killed in the shooting. Speaking at a memorial service for all of them on Wednesday night, President Obama said he wanted America to be as good as Christina envisioned it. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Here on Earth, we place our hands over our hearts, and we commit ourselves as Americans to forging a country that is forever worthy of her gentle, happy spirit. May God bless and keep those we've lost in restful and eternal peace. May He love and watch over the survivors. And may He bless the United States of America. AZUZ: Arizona Representative Gabrielle Giffords is a survivor of the shooting. She's one of six people still in the hospital, and the only one in critical condition. Wednesday, Giffords opened her eyes for the first time since the shooting and gave her husband a sign she could hear him. Brazil Floods . AZUZ: Australia isn't the only country dealing with ravaging floodwaters right now. We're gonna take you to Brazil, South America, a nation in its summer rainy season. Rains that are out of hand in some places. We want you to look at this -- families that are in ""extreme risk"" of being washed away. This includes people in the mountains, and people near riverbeds, as landslides, mudslides, and rising waters leave thousands homeless. Around 400 people have died, many are missing. Some families are living in schools and gyms. In some spots, the only dry areas you can see are roofs and tree-tops. And more rains are in the forecast. The country's government is taking some heat for poor disaster planning and allowing people to build homes in dangerous, mountain areas. Etna Erupts . AZUZ: This is what happens when Europe's most famous volcano gets active. Tremors started rumbling in Italy's Mount Etna on Tuesday. By Wednesday, you can see what was going on. The volcano's on the island of Sicily, about 18 miles from the nearest town. It may be spewing ash, but it doesn't seem to be threatening anyone at the moment. That wasn't the case in 1669, the date of Etna's most violent eruption, which killed 20,000 people. I.D. Me . CNN STUDENT NEWS: See if you can I.D. me. I was born in Atlanta, Georgia in 1929. My name was changed from Michael King when I was five years old. In 1964, I became the youngest person at the time to win the Nobel Peace Prize. I'm Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., one of the most famous figures in the U.S. civil rights movement. MLK Day . AZUZ: Many consider Martin Luther King the face of the civil rights movement. Between 1957 and 1968, King traveled over six million miles and gave more than 2,500 speeches. His message: Equality through non-violence. Dr. King organized boycotts and protests. He worked with presidents on creating civil rights laws. And in 1963, he helped lead the march on Washington where Dr. King gave his famous ""I Have a Dream"" speech. In that, he discussed his vision for a world where people would be judged by their character, rather than their skin color. On April 4th, 1968, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee. Four days later, the idea of a federal holiday honoring him was first introduced in Congress. That proposal became law in 1983 and the first nationwide observance of the Martin Luther King holiday was in 1986. The holiday is on the third Monday of January every year, which is this coming Monday, January 17th. Many people use it as an opportunity to help out with community service projects. For everyone, it's a chance to remember King's dream and the legacy that he left in his work to achieve it. School Lunches . AZUZ: Pizza sticks, tater tots, and hot dogs: the government wants those off your school lunch menu and replaced with foods like chef salad, baked sweet potato fries, and whole wheat spaghetti. It's a new proposal from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and part of the Obama administration's efforts to cut down on childhood obesity. Healthier foods often cost more, so the government plans to help poorer schools pay for the changes. Critics say it shouldn't be up to the federal government to decide what schools are allowed to serve -- that it's a state or local issue. The rule would limit calories for school breakfasts and lunches. If it takes effect, you could see changes several months down the road. Shoutout . CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mrs. Goodman's journalism students at Grassfield High School in Chesapeake, Virginia! What is the atomic symbol for gold? You know what to do! Is it: A) Ag, B) Au, C) Go or D) Hg? You've got three seconds -- GO! The Latin word for gold is aurum; that's why its symbol is Au. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! How Gold is Mined . AZUZ: Gold, money and dreams: A dangerous combination that has been the downfall of many and the success of a few. The California gold rush of 1849 doesn't scratch the surface of gold's historic lure. Ancient Egyptians and Etruscans wore it. Entire currencies were based on it. But why gold instead of other metals? Well, it doesn't tarnish or corrode. It's easy to work with and shape. And it's very hard to destroy. Poppy Harlow takes us far underground, where modern miners cash in on methods their predecessors, didn't even dream about. (BEGIN VIDEO) UNIDENTIFIED MALE, BARRICK CHIEF SAFETY OFFICER: Your self-rescuer is going to go probably on your right-hand side. POPPY HARLOW, CNNMONEY.COM ANCHOR: We're gearing up to go two miles deep into one of the biggest gold mines in the country. I can't believe we're two Empire State buildings down below the surface of the Earth. And we still have quite a ways to go. Hunting for gold goes all the way back to 4,000 B.C. And today, the obsession continues. Here, in Barrick Gold's Cortez Mine in rural Nevada, more than one million ounces of gold were mined last year alone. That's over $1 billion worth. DAVE BUNDROCK, GOLD MINER: Geology has figured out where the pot of ore is, then they just point us toward it. HARLOW: But finding gold these days is much more complex and expensive than just, well, panning for it. In fact, you can't even see the gold in this mine. I mean, it's amazing to me to think that this is gold, but it is. RANDY HAGER, GOLD MINER:Yes. HARLOW: It's right here. HAGER: Yes. You can't see it. It's microscopic. HARLOW: Miners have to drill and blast through layers and layers of rock to reach the gold. HAGER: There's gold in this. And what I'm going to do is turn this into a pile of muck. HARLOW: It looks like dirt, but muck is actually gold ore. Tiny particles of gold that will eventually make up a gold brick. HAGER: I'm going to get about 10 truckloads out of here. About 10 ounces of gold - 10 to 15 ounces of gold at $1,400 an ounce. And we'll do this several times during a day's work. HARLOW: Not bad money. HAGER: Not bad money. HARLOW: So, after the gold ore is mined, about 400 tons of it goes in massive trucks just like this one. Of that, only four ounces is pure gold. It's taken, it's crushed, then it's taken to a mill and then it's refined. JULIUS STIEGER, PROCESS DIVISION MANAGER, BRARRICK-CORTEZ: After of the ore is crushed and ground, we leach the gold out. From there we put it into a pressure-cooker environment, high temperature and pressure with various chemicals, and that pulls the gold out. This is the final step before pouring the gold bar. HARLOW: Barrick mines gold for around $300 an ounce, and gold is selling for record highs, around $1,400 an ounce. Those big margins mean jobs. Something desperately needed in Nevada, a state struggling with the highest in unemployment and foreclosure rates in the country. JOHN ALEXANDER, SHOVEL OPERATOR: I can provide for my family. You know? And I don't know any other job in this world that can -- I get paid for what I get paid and survive now these days, the way the prices are. HAGER: There's job security here with gold that high. Not going to run out of work. (END VIDEO) Before We Go . AZUZ: With snow falling and daily temperatures in the 20s this time of year, ideas for outdoor activities can come to a stalemate. But not for a pair of local artists in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Someone had this kingly idea for them to sculpt an ice chess set! Don't know how long they pawn-dered the proposal, but it took over a month and a half for them to piece this together and let the game begin. Goodbye . AZUZ: It's something people can play by day, and by knights. A board to keep freedom in check, mate! I'm Carl Azuz, and our next move is gonna be January 18th!

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN)  -- Mexico's tourism director on Wednesday downplayed the risk of violence facing tourists, despite warnings for travelers to think twice about visiting the country. A cliff diver jumps from ""La Quebrada"" cliff in Acapulco, Mexico. The diving is a popular tourist attraction. ""In all parts of the world, you have to be careful with what you do,"" Oscar Fitch told CNN en Espanol. ""What I am saying is there are very safe zones and there are zones that are not safe."" In recent days, the United States, Canada, France, Italy and Germany have issued alerts about travel to Mexico, where drug violence was blamed for more than 5,400 killings last year. The warnings appear to have had little effect, according to Mauricio Baranda, Mexico country manager at Carlson Wagonlit Travel. ""For our part, we have detected no significant drop because of that type of situation,"" he said. ""Much more significant is the reduction [in travel to Mexico] because of the financial crisis."" In an unusual move, the U.S. State Department issued a travel alert last month targeting spring break travelers, for whom Mexico is a popular destination. ""The situation in Ciudad Juarez is of special concern,"" the alert said. ""Mexican authorities report that more than 1,800 people have been killed in the city since January 2008. Additionally, this city of 1.6 million people experienced more than 17,000 car thefts and 1,650 carjackings in 2008."" Watch as troops roll into Juarez and officials say it's working » . Some students appeared to be paying attention. ""I think that, if there is a big problem in Mexico, they [students] should go somewhere else, because you never know what is going to happen,"" said Nereida Solis, a student. ""I think it would be a good idea to consider security things,"" added Karen Velasquez, another student. But student Aaron Cutler was more fatalistic. ""That's life,"" he said. ""There is violence in Israel, there is violence in India. I don't know much about the situation and how it has turned out. I can't comment much, but if people want to go, people are going to go."" Mexican authorities said the country remains a preferred destination for U.S. vacationers, but acknowledged that the warnings may lead some of the 18 million who typically visit their neighbor south of the border to find another place to go this year.","United States, Canada, France, others have issued alerts about travel to Mexico .

"WEIMAR, Germany (CNN) -- A long narrow road winds through a thick forest up a hill called the ""Ettesberg,"" on the outskirts of Weimar in central Germany. The ovens where tens of thousands of bodies were cremated are restored and working. The road goes on for miles through the forest, but every once in a while you see an old railway station, a tower, or an old structure withering in the German rain. This road was named ""the trail of blood,"" by inmates of the infamous concentration camp Buchenwald, because of the death marches they were forced to undertake as they were deported to work as slave laborers for Nazi Germany's defense industry from 1937 to 1945. ""The trail of blood"" leads straight to the entrance gate of the former concentration camp -- a structure with a huge iron gate in the middle, a tower with a clock above, and arrest cells in the building's wings. U.S. troops saw the horror of the Nazi regime first hand when they came through this gate on April 11, 1945, and found camp inmates starved to the bone, many too weak to stand. ""We couldn't even show our joy at this moment, which we had been waiting for so long,"" said former inmate Zeev Factor, recalling the day American troops came to liberate the camp. Now the camp is getting ready to host President Obama, who has a special relationship with Buchenwald. His great-uncle Charlie Payne, 84, helped liberate a sub-camp here when he was an infantryman fighting in World War II. ""The survivors see President Obama almost like a grandson of theirs,"" said the director of the Buchenwald memorial, Volker Knigge, speaking just outside the front gate. ""The president is related to one of the brave men who came here and saw the Nazi horror first hand. The soldiers only had vague knowledge of what concentration camps actually were, but here they saw people too weak to survive, even after having been liberated."" Historians estimate that of the 20,000 inmates who were liberated by U.S. troops, 1,000 died shortly after because of exhaustion and the effects of years of starvation. It is easy to see why. Every building in the Buchenwald complex radiates death, suffering and evil. In the crematorium, where tens of thousands of bodies were burned, the ovens have been restored and are fully functional. In a cellar below the cremation room, meat hooks in the walls were used by SS guards to hang and strangle more than 1,000 inmates, many of them women and children. Obama will see these testimonies to the barbarism of the Nazis when he takes a tour of the camp with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. He will also meet some of the survivors who Volker Knigge says feel so close to this president.","President Obama visits Buchenwald concentration camp, Germany, on Friday .

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: It's a pleasure to welcome you to this midweek edition of CNN Student News. We're bringing the world, without commercials, to your classroom. And I'm your captain, Carl Azuz. First Up: Arizona Discourse . AZUZ: Doctors are keeping a close watch on Arizona Representative Gabrielle Giffords. Three days after a gunman tried to assassinate her at an event in Tucson, Giffords was responding to doctors' commands and giving hopeful signs, though her condition remained critical. Experts say if she survives, her recovery could take anywhere from several months to a year and a half. Meantime, President Obama was scheduled to fly to Tucson today. The White House says he'll probably attend a memorial service and meet with some families of the shooting victims. Six people were killed and 14 wounded in the attack. There's a national conversation building around part of this story, and we're gonna include you in it. Here's what's going on: This man you're about to see here, an Arizona sheriff named Clarence Dupnik, has been talking about the Arizona shooter, and what might have influenced him to attack. Here's part of the sheriff's opinion: . CLARENCE DUPNIK, SHERIFF OF PIMA COUNTY, ARIZONA: When the rhetoric about hatred, about mistrust of government, about paranoia of how government operates, and to try to inflame the public on a daily basis, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, has impact on people, especially who are unbalanced personalities to begin with. AZUZ: The sheriff, who's a Democrat, is suggesting that conservative talk show hosts and media coverage of people who are angry at the government somehow influenced the Arizona shooter. But police have not discussed an official motive for the attack. And another sheriff, Joe Arpaio, another Arizona sheriff, says all the evidence so far suggests the gunman had no clear political motives -- that he's just a deeply troubled and mentally unstable person. What do Americans think? Well, a new national poll by CBS shows most Americans, 57 percent, don't think angry political speech contributed to the shooting. 32 percent think it did. Here's where you come into the conversation. What are your thoughts on the Arizona shooting? Are there any lessons to be learned from it? Our blog is always open at CNNStudentNews.com! What's the Word . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: What's the Word? a type of storm with extremely strong winds that blow from the northeast . NOR'EASTER . That's the word! Winter Storm Update . AZUZ: Chances are, if you live on America's East coast and haven't yet been socked in by snow and ice, your turn is coming. The storm that smacked the Southeast is now heading north. Forecasters expect it to merge with another system from the Midwest. What does all that mean? Another foot of snow possible for New York City. You see New York here, earlier this year, reeling from storms then. Another foot of snow is possible for Boston, Massachusetts. At least 30 states were under some sort of winter storm watch or warning yesterday. And the South? Still crippled by chaotic conditions. The snow that covered the streets froze into a hard sheet of ice Monday night. Driving was out -- even walking was dangerous in some spots. Rob Marciano stepped outside CNN Center to show us why this is such a big deal for the Southeast. Rob? (BEGIN VIDEO) ROB MARCIANO, CNN WEATHER ANCHOR: Check it out, Carl. Snow and ice on the sidealks of downtown Atlanta. Yeah, it's happened before but not sticking around for days at a time. What an amazing, incredible ice storm this was, and snow storm, across the South, especially for Atlanta. We seem to have been right in the core of the heaviest snow. And then, bam! The freezing temperatures and the freezing rain coming on top of that just really crippling this entire metropolitan area. From downtown to the interstates we had jack-knifed tractor trailers all over the place. On that 285 loop which is designed to take the tractor trailers out of the downtown area, well, that didn't help entirely too much. So, the other thing that's not helping is the storm cranking up the Northeastern seaboard. That's bringing in even more cold air. Even though we get times where it gets above freezing during the day. At night the temperatures drop well below freezing. You got to look at this and say to yourself, Atlanta's mentality for snow removal is let it melt. Well, we may have to wait for quite some time, Carl? (END VIDEO) Oil Spill Report . AZUZ: Thanks, Rob. If we don't take drastic action to prevent this in the future, it could happen again. That's the word from a final report on last summer's catastrophic oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. It started with this, an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig. That later sank and caused the worst oil spill in American history. The clean-up is still going on for this! The ""National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Spill and Offshore Drilling"" says the government and the oil industry need to research more, invest more money, and keep better tabs on safety and knowledge of how to contain oil spills. Shoutout . JOHN LISK, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mrs. Huber's exploratory class at Loveland Middle School in Loveland, Ohio! Port-au-Prince is the capital of what country? If you think you know it, shout it out! Is it: A) Cuba, B) Dominican Republic, C) Haiti or D) Venezuela? You've got three seconds -- GO! Port-au-Prince is the capital of the Caribbean nation of Haiti. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Haiti Then & Now . AZUZ: It's been exactly one year since that capital -- and much of Haiti -- were violently shaken to the ground by a tremendous earthquake. Flooding and disease outbreaks have further slowed down Haiti's recovery. Still needed there: safe water and sewage systems, training for health workers, money to help get rid of diseases. Moni Basu describes how one year after the quake, not much has changed. (BEGIN VIDEO) MONI BASU, CNN CORRESPONDENT: My name is Moni Basu. I'm a journalist for CNN. When I came to Haiti last January my heart broke. I've covered difficult stories before but this one was particularly difficult for me. And I had hoped that when I came back a year later I would see a lot more progress than this. I'm sitting here in the Notre Dame Cathedral in Port-au-Prince. As you can see it pretty much looks like it did last January 12. Every Sunday thousands of people come here still for services There's no building left here so the priest preaches outside in a small park. The building was shattered but their faith was not shattered. Their faith is stronger than it ever was. I think the most iconic image that came out in the days after the earthquake was the national palace. It was destroyed to the point where it had been slated for demolition. But very little work has been done on it since last January. And it's a constant reminder to the people of what happened here. This is the Champs de Mars Plaza in Port-au-Prince, the central plaza in the city. Slowly in the days and weeks after the earthquake, a tent city sprung up here, and the more the time went by people realized, ""We're not going anywhere, we're going have to make new homes, new lives for ourselves right here."" There's a grocery store, there's a cyber cafe, even. The tent city has become a little city within the larger city of Port-au-Prince. It's pretty shocking to see that a year later people are still living like this. I'm always amazed when I come back to Haiti to see how much strength the people here have. It's just incredible to me how they are able to go on. I just can't imagine having to live through something like this day after day after day. (END VIDEO) Promo .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN)  -- The Indian navy captured 23 piracy suspects who tried to take over a merchant vessel in the Gulf of Aden, between the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, Indian officials said. Piracy suspects raise their hands in surrender as an Indian navy boat approaches. In addition to the 12 Somali and 11 Yemeni suspects, the Indian navy seized two small boats and ""a substantial cache of arms and equipment,"" the military said in a statement. Among the seized items were seven AK-47 automatic rifles, three other automatic weapons and 13 loaded magazines; a rocket-propelled grenade launcher along with rockets, cartridges and grenades; up to three outboard motors and a global positioning system receiver. Pirate attacks in the waters off Somalia have increased this year, with armed men staging increasingly bold attacks on ever-larger targets. This year, pirates have attacked nearly 100 vessels off Somalia's coast and hijacked nearly 40, the International Maritime Bureau said.  Map: See where incidents have been reported » . The Indian warship Mysore, which carried out Saturday's operation, is on anti-piracy patrol in the Gulf of Aden, the release said. The Mysore received a distress call Saturday morning from the MV Gibe, a merchant vessel sailing under an Ethiopian flag. The Gibe reported that two boats were firing small arms at it. The merchant ship, which was 13 nautical miles from the Mysore, fired back with small arms onboard the vessel. The Mysore changed course toward the Gibe and launched an armed helicopter, the Indian military said. Upon seeing the helicopter and the Mysore closing in, the attackers broke off and tried to flee, the release said. The warship caught up to the boats, the larger of which was described as a 24- to 30-foot dhow, a traditional Arab sailboat. The dhow, identified as bearing the name Salahaddin, was towing a smaller skiff. Indian sailors boarded the Salahaddin, the military said, and the 23 suspects surrendered peacefully. The suspects, weapons, ammunition and equipment will be handed over to authorities, and the Mysore will return to patrol duties, India said. Last month, the Indian navy said it had sunk a pirate ""mother vessel"" in the Gulf of Aden. The ship's owner said the sunken vessel was a Thai trawler that was being seized by pirates when an Indian warship fired on it. Sixteen crew members were aboard the ship, said Wicharn Sirichaiekawat, owner of the Ekawat Nava 5. Two have been accounted for. One crewman was found alive after six days adrift in the Gulf of Aden, and one is confirmed dead, the ship's owner said. Indian authorities insisted that their ship, the frigate INS Tabar, had acted against a pirate vessel that had threatened to attack it. ""We fired in self-defense and in response to firing upon our vessel,"" Commodore Nirad Sinha, a navy spokesman, told CNN. ""It was a pirate vessel in the international waters, and its stance was aggressive."" He said the ship the Tabar fired on was laden with ammunition. All sorts of vessels -- freight and cargo ships, cruise liners and private yachts -- have been attacked in the waters off Somalia. In many hijackings, pirates take the crew and passengers hostage and demand a ransom. Just this month, Somali pirates captured two Yemeni fishing boats and 22 Yemeni fishermen in the Gulf of Aden, Yemen's official news agency SABA reported. A day earlier, the German cruise liner MS Columbus said it would fly its 246 passengers and most of its crew over the Gulf of Aden instead of through it to avoid any pirate attack. The United States is reportedly circulating a proposal in the U.N. Security Council that would allow military forces to enter Somali territory in ""hot pursuit"" of pirates. The Pentagon said Friday, however, that there are no plans for U.S. forces to go ashore in pursuit of pirates in Somalia.","Suspects caught in Gulf of Aden after failed hijacking, India says .

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. JOYCE JOSEPH, CNN STUDENT NEWS: That paper airplane can only mean one thing: It's time for a new edition of CNN Student News! Carl is at an anti-bullying conference this week. I'm Joyce Joseph. First up today, the halls of Congress. First Up: Leaders in Congress . JOSEPH: The 112th U.S. Congress won't start until January, but it's picking its leaders this week! These are the men and women who will guide the members of their political parties. In the Senate, things will look very familiar. Democratic Senator Harry Reid is the current Senate majority leader. He'll hold onto that title. The Democrats lost some seats in the midterms, but still have a majority. On the other side of the Senate aisle, Republican Mitch McConnell, who is the current Senate minority leader, will continue on in that role. Control of the House of Representatives changed hands in the midterms; the Republicans will be in the majority when the new session starts. They unanimously picked Representative John Boehner to continue as their leader. He's now in line to be the new speaker of the House. Democrats voted for the current House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, to become the House minority leader. But not all of them. Of the 193 House Democrats who will be part of the next Congress, about 25 percent voted for someone other than Pelosi to be leader. Security Hearing . JOSEPH: That's not the only thing Congress is doing this week. A Senate committee is talking with the head of the Transportation Security Agency about security checks at airports. This is something you've been talking about on our blog: the advanced scanning machines and security checks. The holiday travel season is almost here, so this is getting a lot of attention. The question is, how do you find a balance between privacy and security? SEN. GEORGE LEMIEUX, (R) FLORIDA: I'm, frankly, bothered by the level of these pat-downs. I've seen them first hand in airports in Florida. I also understand that you would like to do everything possible to keep American people safe, but there are limits. There has to be a balance here. What can we do to right this balance? I think we've gone too far afield. JOHN PISTOLE, TSA ADMINISTRATOR: We know that there are additional things that we could be doing to detect things. And we know, based on pat-downs and AIT, we have detected dozens and dozens of, let's say, artfully concealed objects that could pose a risk to aviation. New Home Construction . JOSEPH: Let's talk about the economy for a second. Experts look at a lot of things to figure out how it's doing. That includes the stock market, unemployment numbers and the housing industry. A new report just came out about housing starts. That's the number of new homes that are being built, and it's down. During the month of October, housing starts dropped nearly 12 percent. In fact, they're at their lowest level in 18 months. Analysts expected the number to fall, but they were a little surprised by how much it dropped. Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mr. Macias's 6th grade humanities class at Michael E. Fossum Middle School in McAllen, Texas! You're looking at the island of Hispaniola. It's made up of Haiti and what other country? Is it: A) Barbados, B) Dominican Republic, C) Jamaica or D) Trinidad? You've got three seconds -- GO! Haiti takes up about one-third of Hispaniola; the Dominican Republic takes up the rest. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Protests in Haiti . JOSEPH: The Dominican Republic is under a maximum health alert. We've talked about the cholera outbreak that's going on in Haiti. Well, Dominican authorities have been worried it might spread to their country, and it looks like it did. Cholera doesn't work like the cold or flu; it usually doesn't get passed from person to person. But officials say a Haitian who works in the Dominican Republic brought the disease back over the border after he went home to Haiti recently. He's the first confirmed case of cholera in Hispaniola's other nation. Back in Haiti, the cholera outbreak has led to violence in one town. We reported on that yesterday. Ivan Watson went there to check out the situation. (BEGIN VIDEO) IVAN WATSON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Roads leading into the city blocked by burning tires, torched cars and even a coffin. Machete-wielding locals patrol the streets. Scenes of chaos less than two weeks before Haiti is supposed to hold presidential elections. We've seen some crowds of young men out on the street. We're told that they're protesting against U.N. peacekeepers. They want them to leave Haiti and Cap Haitien. They blame them for the cholera epidemic in this country. The peacekeepers can do little more for now than put out fires and face off against an angry population terrified by the deadliest cholera epidemic to hit Haiti in more than half a century. MOSES VALCY, TAXI DRIVER: We got so much people sick right now, so the people very, very, very, very scared about cholera right now. WATSON: The U.N. peacekeepers are effectively under siege, targeted by angry locals who almost went after us. The protesters are mostly armed with rocks and bottles. They clearly control most of the streets right now. As the sun set on a second day of riots, tear gas and smoke from dozens of fires continues to rise, over Haiti's second largest city. (END VIDEO) CNN Heroes . JOSEPH: CNN Heroes: everyday people who are changing the world. Tune in for the all-star tribute on Thanksgiving night. That's one week from tonight. It airs at 8 p.m. Eastern on CNN. Before that, head to CNNStudentNews.com; look for our Spotlight section. You're seeing that right here. That's where you'll find our CNN Heroes Teacher and Parent Guide. It has questions and activities that help students identify heroes in history and in their own lives. What's the Word? JOHN LISK, CNN STUDENT NEWS: What's the Word? it's an adjective that means relating to or about a city; it's also the opposite of rural . URBAN . That's the word! The Urban Brain . JOSEPH: According to the United Nations, more than half of the world's population lives in urban areas. If you live in a city, you know there's a lot going on, a lot to keep track of. What you might not know is that all of that could affect your brain. Doctor Sanjay Gupta explains how and what you can do about it. (BEGIN VIDEO) DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Life in the concrete jungle, that's what they call it. And if you live in a city, you are probably used to something like this. Problem is, with so many different distractions, it's very hard to focus on one particular thing. It's called controlled perception, toggling back and forth between so many things. And it can leave you feeling mentally exhausted. There's no question that living in a city has a lot of advantages. Shops are open all hours of the day, you can buy things, there are also lots of cultural attractions. But what we're finding more and more is that all of that comes with a price. There's an impact on the brain, as well. In fact, here in Japan, it's a big topic of discussion. They are talking about the fact that mental illness is one of the biggest health problems here, and they attribute it to this complex, high-tech environment. The thing is, more people live in cities than ever before, and they are living in cities longer than ever. So, all of this is expected to get worse. And here's why: All that stimulation, well, it can cause spikes to the stress hormone known as cortisol. And as a result, it can be very difficult for the brain to hold things in memory, reduces your self-control, dull your thinking, it may even speed up cognitive decline. Just from living in a city. Think of it as your brain more rapidly aging. But here's the part I like in all this: Getting away from the stress associated with the chaos in a big city can be as simple as finding a place like this. In fact, recent studies have shown that just glimpses of green areas can make a huge difference in your overall cognitive function. Makes you less distracted, less stressed, and more relaxed. In fact, just a few minutes away from bustling Kobe, Japan, we found this place: a very old park. A lot of people come here for a few minutes a day. There are shrines, and there are good opportunities to find green space, and that really seems to be the key: find green spaces in your city and make sure to use them as much as possible. (END VIDEO) Before We Go . JOSEPH: Finally, have you ever sat in math class and wondered: when am I gonna use this? Well, this is when. Check out this incredible video from Gawker TV. If she makes 128 shots in 60 seconds, how many shots does she make per second? Around two. Let me say that again: She's making two shots every second! And in case you hadn't noticed, she doesn't miss a single one. You might call her a show off. Goodbye . JOSEPH: We think she's just a hot shot. Here's my question: Since she's doing this in an arcade, do you think she had to pay for the game, or did they give her a free throw? You might call that pun a foul, but we'll bounce right back with more tomorrow. For CNN Student News, I'm Joyce Joseph.","Find out who the leaders will be in the 112th U.S. Congress .

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We're seniors at Tulare Union High School, and you're watching.... ENTIRE GROUP: ...CNN Student News! Woo! CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Want to thank my seniors for that very energetic introduction. I'm Carl Azuz. This is CNN Student News. And in our penultimate program of 2010, we present some perspectives on privacy. But first though, we're headed to Washington, D.C. First Up:  Senate Tax Vote . AZUZ: 81 yays; 19 nays. So, the tax cut plan passes in the U.S. Senate. This is the compromise that President Obama and Republican leaders came up with that would extend a series of tax cuts for another two years. Yesterday, the Senate approved the plan which would cost more than $850 billion. Now though, it has to go through the House of Representatives. Some of the Democratic members there aren't happy with parts of this plan, so this is not a something that is set in stone. Oil Spill Lawsuit . AZUZ: The U.S. government is filing a lawsuit over this year's massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The suit is aimed at BP and eight other companies who were involved in the spill. When he made the announcement yesterday, Attorney General Eric Holder said ""we intend to hold them fully accountable for their violations of the law."" The lawsuit, which accuses the companies of failing to prevent or control the spill, is one of nearly 80 suits that are all being combined together. CEO Meeting . AZUZ: And a meeting brings together politics and big business. President Obama got together yesterday with the heads of 20 of America's biggest companies, including Google, American Express and PepsiCo. Here, you can see the president walking to the meeting at Blair House just across the street from the White House. He said the goal was to find ways to boost the economy and increase hiring. The group talked about energy, taxes and trade with other countries. One CEO who was at the meeting said he hoped it would provide the opportunity to figure out some plans to help the economy. Shoutout . JOHN LISK, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for the Shoutout! Which of these ships was involved in the Boston Tea Party? If you think you know it, shout it out! Was it the: A) Dartmouth, B) Merrimack, C) Mayflower or D) Pinafore? You've got three seconds -- GO! The Dartmouth was one of the ships involved in the Boston Tea Party. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Boston Tea Party Anniversary . AZUZ: That famous protest happened 237 years ago today. A group of colonists disguised themselves as Native Americans, went on ships in Boston Harbor, and dumped hundreds of chests of tea overboard. What they were protesting against was the British Tea Act. Remember, the American colonies were controlled by Great Britain back then. Some colonists were angry about the taxes being created by the British government. The British parliament was furious about the Boston Tea Party and set up more laws in Boston. All of this helped to eventually lead to the American Revolution. Shoutout Extra Credit . MICHELLE WRIGHT, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for a Shoutout Extra Credit! Who is the founder of Facebook? You know what to do! Is it: A) Bill Gates, B) Shawn Fanning, C) Steve Jobs or D) Mark Zuckerberg? Another three seconds on the clock -- GO! Zuckerberg started the social networking site when he was a student at Harvard University. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout Extra Credit! Person of the Year . AZUZ: That was back in 2003. In 2010, Mark Zuckerberg is TIME Magazine's person of the year. TIME is owned by Time Warner, the same company that owns CNN. Other people who were considered for this year's award: the Chilean miners, the Tea Party movement, and the founder of WikiLeaks. TIME said that it chose Zuckerberg because his social networking site has had a huge impact on how we communicate and do business. The magazine pointed out that Facebook has linked one-twelfth of the entire world into a single network. If Facebook was a country, it would be the third largest country on the planet. What You Share Online? AZUZ: Nearly half of all Americans have a Facebook account. We know a lot of you do. When you post something online, even if it's meant to be private, there's a good chance it can end up being public. I talked with some Atlanta-area teens and their parents recently about how much privacy they expect to have when they log on. (BEGIN VIDEO) AZUZ: As far as phones go, and sharing your numbers, how many of you expect your numbers to remain private? And have you ever gotten a text or a call from a number you didn't recognize? GROUP: Yes . ADAM VRTIS, STUDENT: But that's normally from someone that's given my number to someone else, not that I approved it. So, never mind, hand goes down! KATHERINE THORNBURGH, STUDENT: I tell my friends not to give away my phone number, but it still happens. AZUZ: These suburban Atlanta teenagers may want their phone number to be private, but I found their expectations were very different when it comes to the internet. Do you expect what you post online to be private? VRTIS: No, I don't. AZUZ: Why not? VRTIS: Everyone sees it, the internet. It's the world wide web; everyone can get to it. I'm pretty careful about what I put on it. HANNAH GALT, STUDENT: I know nothing's really private. AZUZ: So, how does that affect what you post on Facebook? GALT: I don't say anything that I don't want anyone to hear. AZUZ: It's a caution instilled by their parents. How much privacy do you give him on Facebook? LORI VRTIS, PARENT: Very little. If they do want privacy, they can get a journal, they can write in it, keep it in their desk drawer. I will never read it. But when you're posting something that everyone can look at, I'm going to look at it also. KAREN THORNBURGH, PARENT: Anything you're willing to put out there in a written form, be willing to stand up in front of the whole high school and announce this. ARIA GALT, PARENT: Well, I teach in a school, so we deal with a lot of these issues each day. And so, I sometimes talk about situations that I've encountered at work and hoping that maybe something would be learned from those as well. AZUZ: And while all three students said they'd texted something they wished they could take back, they were far more reserved in their internet behavior, largely because of their parents' involvement. JOE VRTIS, PARENT: Professing the ignorance of it and not monitoring it, I think you're setting yourself up for failure as a parent. I think the kids definitely need guidance. (END VIDEO) Career Connections . AZUZ: It's time for another edition of Career Connections. Our own Tomeka Jones joins me here. Tomeka, I hear you're focusing on the investigative side of journalism today. TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS ASSOCIATE PRODUCER: That's right, Carl. Amber Lyon is an investigative reporter and correspondent for CNN. Before she started working here, she moved to Central America to help improve herself as a journalist. Amber credits her mother for helping her decide what career path she wanted to take. And she says she's successful because she has a passion for journalism and knew she couldn't fail at it. (BEGIN VIDEO) AMBER LYON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The reason I love being a journalist is that you can really make a huge difference in society. A video, I say, can say a million words. General assignment is more you do the breaking news, the quick-turn stories that feed the daily news. They're very important. You'll find a lot more general assignment reporters than you ever will investigative reporters. Investigative is more like, we find one issue and maybe spend sometimes an entire year looking into it and getting down to the bottom of it. It's more documentary style. One thing you'll have to learn in news more than anything is that, how can you make your story different, how can you get the public's attention? My whole goal with Backpack Reporters is to be able to bring them on stories with us. Let them experience the story, kind of, we're going to be taking a journey and I'm going to bring you with me. So, with the backpack, I look at it as, okay, I'm going to throw on my backpack and come with me; we're going to go on a journey to find the story. And I just try to make it really intimate with viewers so that they can connect to it. A lesson to everybody, whether you're a journalist or any other type of career, is be willing to take risks. Because if you're truly passionate about it, follow your passion and success will follow, and it will pay off in the end. (END VIDEO) Promo . AZUZ: We've been making Career Connections all semester.

"(CNN) -- Chelsea have one foot in the Champions League semifinals after fighting back from going a goal down at Anfield to beat Premier League rivals Liverpool 3-1 in their quarterfinal first leg on Wednesday. Chelsea players celebrate Branislav Ivanovic's equalizer on their way to a stunning win at Anfield. The London side knocked Liverpool out of the competition at the last four stage last year and they look set to repeat that feat this season, despite going behind to an early goal from Fernando Torres. With just five minutes on the clock, Dirk Kuyt fed Alvaro Arbeloa with a clever back-heel and when the full-back delivered his low cross an unmarked Torres applied the perfect finish. Didier Drogba squandered a gilt-edged chance to equalize seconds later. Fellow-Ivorian Salomon Kalou slipped the ball into his path but Drogba's shot was kept out by goalkeeper Pepe Reina. Drogba wasted another clear chance to level in the 28th minute after Michael Ballack's low cross had allowed the striker to shake off Jamie Carragher -- but he blazed the ball high over the bar from just eight yards out. Chelsea continued to press forward and their effort paid off in the 38th minute when Branislav Ivanovic equalized with an unmarked header from Florent Malouda's corner. The second half saw much of the same with Liverpool on the back-foot as Chelsea pressed forward and they nearly added a second in the 51st minute when Frank Lampard's pass put Drogba clear again. This time the striker's shot beat Reina but Carragher managed to scamper back to clear the goal-bound effort for a corner. Liverpool briefly threatened when Torres fired over the bar from an acute angle and Chelsea suffered a blow when captain John Terry received a yellow card for a late challenge on Reina, meaning he will be suspended for the second leg at Stamford Bridge next week. However, Guus Hiddink's side may not now need their inspirational leader after two goals in six second-half minutes stunned the home supporters. In the 61st minute, the Liverpool defense again went missing to allow Ivanovic to socre a carbon-copy header, this time from Lampard's corner. Then in the 67th minute, a quick break from Malouda saw his superb low left-wing cross turned home by Drogba from close-range. From then on, Chelsea were in cruise control and a dispirited Liverpool could have fallen further behind had Malouda and Salomon Kalou converted last chances for the visitors. With Barcelona thrashing Bayern Munich 4-0 in Wednesday's other match, a Chelsea v Barcelona semifinal looks assured unless Liverpool manage an unlikely win next week. Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez acknowledged it will be ""very difficult"" for his team to overturn the deficit at Stamford Bridge. He told Sky Sports: ""Clearly it will be very difficult -- but anything can happen. We have to play well and score three goals and have a very good game against a very good team."" The Spaniard continued: ""I felt we started really well but after the goal we didn't pass the ball properly. We were giving the ball away, and they were passing it well.""","Chelsea fight back to beat Liverpool 3-1 in their Champions League quarterfinal .

But the debate has been whether these cuts should be extended for everyone. Yesterday, the House of Representatives voted to extend the tax cuts, but only for families that make less than $250,000 a year. If you make more than that, your taxes would go up. Democrats argue that the government can't afford to continue the tax cuts for wealthy Americans. Republicans say that not extending those cuts could hurt the economy even more. Even though the vote happened, the debate still isn't over. The Senate  has to vote on this, and sources have said that both parties -- and the president -- are trying to work out a compromise that could mean an extension of the tax cuts for everyone. How Bad Could it Get? AZUZ: Another big issue facing Congress is the federal debt. That is how much money the U.S. government borrows to pay its bills. Earlier this week, a bipartisan commission announced some of its ideas about how to cut the debt. We reported on that yesterday. But what if nothing happens? What if the debt just keeps getting bigger? Mary Snow examines some of the possibilities. (BEGIN VIDEO) MARY SNOW, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: As European countries are roiled by spending cuts to stave off bankruptcy, the focus turns to U.S. debt. With a bipartisan panel commissioned by the president warning, ""If the U.S. does not put its house in order, the reckoning will be sure and the devastation severe."" At stake: a national public debt of nine trillion dollars. Panel member David Cote, the CEO of Honeywell, spells it out like this: . DAVID COTE, CEO, HONEYWELL: So, to put it into perspective, if you had spent a million dollars a day since Jesus Christ was born 2,010 years ago, you would still not have spent a trillion dollars. SNOW: While there's debate over what and how to cut, to do nothing carries the risk of a collapsed economy requiring an international bailout like what happened recently in countries like Greece and Ireland. The question is, could the same thing happen to the U.S.? Even leading fiscal experts say it's impossible to predict, but... MAYA C. MACGUINEAS, NEW AMERICA FOUNDATION: The whole world is watching right now. And the folks on Wall Street and who lend the U.S. money from around the world are watching what we are doing and seeing if we get our fiscal house in order. SNOW: And Maya MacGuineas, the head of the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, says the U.S. doesn't have a lot of time to act. The risk is tied to U.S. dependence on foreign lenders, especially China. If those lenders don't see the U.S. as a safe haven, they could pull back. But Greg Ip, U.S. editor of the Economist, says the rest of the world has no interest in seeing the U.S. collapse into bankruptcy. GREG IP, ECONOMIST: In the case of the Chinese, they're not buying treasury bonds as some charitable act. They're doing it to prop up the U.S. dollar because that actually makes it easier for them to export stuff to the U.S. SNOW: Bottom line is, it affects everybody. If the U.S. has to pay more to borrow money, it trickles down to higher interest rates for everything to mortgages to business loans. And ultimately, that hurts economic growth. Mary Snow, CNN, New York. (END VIDEO) Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mrs. Herman's social studies classes at Marion High School in Marion, Iowa! Which of these terms is a form of political punishment? Is it: A) Gerrymander, B) Reconciliation, C) Censure or D) Filibuster? You've got three seconds -- GO! A censure is an official reprimand of someone who's done something wrong. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Rep. Rangel Censure . AZUZ: Might not sound that bad, but in political terms, a censure is a big deal. Yesterday, the House of Representatives voted to censure New York Democratic Representative Charlie Rangel. Rangel, whom you see here, has served in the House for nearly 40 years. Last month, he was found guilty of violating House ethics rules, including failing to pay some taxes. He apologized, but says he hasn't done anything corrupt and asked the House for fairness before it voted on the censure yesterday. As part of his punishment, Rangel has to stand on the House floor while the censure against him is read out loud. World Cup Hosts . AZUZ: All right, kicking it over to sports, now. Who is going to host the World Cup, the world's biggest soccer tournament? We already know it's Brazil in 2014. As for the one after that... SEPP BLATTER, FIFA PRESIDENT: ...organized in Russia. AZUZ: Russia will play host to the tournament in 2018. It'll be the first time that the country is home to the World Cup. BLATTER: The winner to organize the 2022 FIFA World Cup is Qatar. AZUZ: And the Middle Eastern nation of Qatar will be host in 2022. It'll be that country's first time hosting, as well. Soccer officials said one reason they chose Qatar was because they're trying to help soccer grow around the world. Touchdown Controversy . AZUZ: From futbol to football, American football. What a player did during a Washington state high school playoff game is getting a lot of attention. Check this out: Ronnie Hastie followed up this touchdown run by kneeling for a quick prayer and pointing to the sky. But then a flag comes flying in. The ref said it was unsportsmanlike conduct for excessive celebration. Ronnie's done this same kneel-and-point after every touchdown this season. Never gotten a flag before. But the rule is that players have to give up the ball immediately after a touchdown, and they can't draw attention to themselves. Ronnie says he wasn't; he was drawing attention to Jesus. But he also says that the refs are in charge, and he isn't planning to point to the sky after future touchdowns, at least on the field. Blog Promo . AZUZ: What a story, what a controversy, what an opportunity for you to sound off on our blog. Do you agree with the penalty? And if this had happened to you, would you have stopped praying after scoring touchdowns? Our blog at CNNStudentNews.com is anxiously awaiting your comments! I am anxiously awaiting the chance to report on them! I.D. Me . JOHN LISK, CNN STUDENT NEWS: See if you can I.D. Me! I was built between 1792 and 1800. I have two wings and 132 different rooms. I'm located at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. I'm the White House, and I've been home to more than 40 families! First Family Decorations . AZUZ: Well, they say there's no place like home for the holidays, even when you live in one of the most famous houses on the planet. The White House is decked out in Christmas decorations, and an estimated 20,000 people will be invited to events there during this holiday season. First lady Michelle Obama opened up the doors at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue to give everyone a look. MICHELLE OBAMA, FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES: In many ways, this is really what the White House is all about. And I say this all the time, it is the people's house. It's a place that is steeped in history, but it is also a place where everyone should feel welcome. Here at the White House, we have 19 Christmas trees in every corner of the White House. We have a giant bow made out of pipe cleaners. We have 350 pounds of gingerbread house that you'll get to see, that took our wonderful pastry chef Bill Yosses and his team an entire month to create. Over the last few days, nearly 100 volunteers from all over the country have been working so hard. They've been making all of the ornaments, they've been hanging the lights and transforming these rooms into breathtaking works of art. That spirit of kindness and generosity is really what the holiday season is all about. And it was the idea behind this year's theme, which is Simple Gifts, because in the end, the greatest blessings of all are the ones that don't cost a thing. The time that we spend with our loved ones, the freedoms we enjoy as Americans, and the joy we feel from reaching out to those in need. Education Makeover . AZUZ: Knock, knock. Who's there? Your principal, and he's here to check on your homework! Doctor Steve Perry, a high school principal, is dropping in on one family to try to whip them into shape. It's a special program called Education Makeover, and it airs tomorrow at 2:30 and 4:30 Eastern on CNN. Check it out! Before We Go . AZUZ: Finally today, you know that expression ""bend but don't break""? This little lady is finding out exactly what that means. The doorstop she's fighting ain't going nowhere! Yeah, it's an adorable animal YouTube video. And you have to give the puppy points for persistence. Emma is displaying some dogged determination here, even if her opponent in this epic battle seems lifeless. We'd suggest that the bulldog take on a doorstop her own size. Goodbye . AZUZ: But it's possible that she'd just recoil in fear. We've reached the tail end of our show, but we'll spring back with more CNN Student News next week. Hope you have a great weekend.

"(CNN Student News) -- November 12, 2010 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • South Korea • New York, New York . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Fridays are awesome! And we're not the only ones who think so. You're gonna meet some other people who totally agree in just a few minutes. I'm Carl Azuz. CNN Student News starts right now! First Up: G-20 Summit . AZUZ: And we begin today at the G-20 Summit, where there is talk of war! But not the type of war most of us think of. No guns, no missiles. This is a currency war, a war over money. It has to do with something that both China and the U.S. are accused of: currency manipulation. This is when a country changes the value of its currency on purpose. Usually, it means making your currency weaker. Why would someone want to do that? Well, if your currency's less valuable, then your exports, the products that you make and sell to other countries, are cheaper. Cheaper products usually means more sales, which means more money for the country. Thing is, if one country is selling more products, that means other countries are selling fewer products. Stan Grant looks at how a couple cases of currency manipulation are causing tension in the global economy right now. (BEGIN VIDEO) STAN GRANT, CNN CORRESPONDENT, BEIJING: Currencies, the new economic battleground. According to some analysts, it has now gone to a whole new level. DONG TAO, CREDIT SUISSE: This is not officially declared, but I do believe that the world is in a currency war. GRANT: On one side, the Chinese renminbi. On the other, the United States dollar. TAO: In the past, it's been one way, U.S. pushing China. And now, we're going to see two-way arguments. GRANT: And in any battle, words are weapons. The U.S. has accused China of manipulating its currency, keeping it low to boost exports and take American jobs. The U.S. has embarked on another round of so-called ""quantitative easing,"" pumping an extra $600 billion into banks to stimulate lending. It lowers the value of the dollar. China looks at America's sluggish growth, financial woes and high unemployment and says, ""Don't blame us."" CUI TIANKAI, VICE MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS: If they get cold, they cannot ask China to take the medicine, because this will not cure their cold. GRANT: In the middle, countries like Australia: staunch U.S. ally, but building its economy on the back of China growth. Australian Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd, recently in China, ever the diplomat. KEVIN RUDD, AUSTRALIAN FOREIGN MINISTER: Well, I think, as they say in the classics, it takes two to tango. So, these questions are not as simple as that. GRANT: At stake is the very future of the world economy. Western countries are no longer the engines of growth. That belongs to emerging economies. According to the International Monetary Fund, China grew 10 times faster than the global average last year and contributed almost 50 percent of world domestic demand. RUDD: Where would we be if China had not generated phenomenal economic growth in the last 18 months? I tell you where we'd be: in a lot of trouble. GRANT: With the world's number one and two economies facing off, there are fears of a rise of protectionism, putting national interests above the world's. The answer ultimately is cooperation, not conflict. (END VIDEO) Impact Your World - Honoring America's Veterans . AZUZ: CNN's Impact Your World page offers ways for you to make a difference. Today, it's focused on America's veterans. Writing a letter, volunteering your time, just saying thank you: There are many ways to pay tribute to these men and women. Learn more at CNNStudentNews.com. Veterans Day . AZUZ: All across the country and around the world, Americans took time to honor their nation's veterans on Thursday. Ceremonies, parades and concerts scheduled all over the U.S. People honored the more than 23 million veterans who are alive today, as well as those who have fallen. Vice President Joe Biden was part of a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknowns in Arlington National Cemetery. He called veterans the ""heart and soul, the very spine of this nation."" Ground Zero Waterfall . AZUZ: This waterfall is part of a different memorial, one that honors some of the victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. You'll find it in New York, and it's part of the National September 11th Memorial and Museum. Engineers started testing it this week. They've been working on it for years, and the president of the memorial said ""to see the water coming down... was inspiring. It was great."" The memorial and museum are scheduled to open on September 11th, 2011. That is the 10th anniversary of the attacks. Disabled Cruise Ship . AZUZ: Ryan Harlan says his recent vacation was really fun. The worst part? ""Being stranded in the middle of the ocean."" Yeah, that would put a damper on things. Ryan was one of 3,300 passengers who got stuck onboard this cruise ship for three days. A fire in the engine room knocked out the power, so no lights, no air conditioning, no hot showers. Plus, the toilets overflowed and some of the food went bad. Thankfully, a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier showed up to help out. It brought out some supplies, some extra food. The cruise ship was eventually towed back into port, and all the passengers are safely back on land. Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mr. Schneider's and Ms. Thompson's classes at Westwood Middle School in Blaine, Minnesota! In Roman mythology, who was the god of fire? Is it: A) Vulcan, B) Mars, C) Mercury or D) Cupid? You've got three seconds -- GO! The Roman god of fire was Vulcan; he was also the god of metalworking. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Erupting Volcanoes . AZUZ: Vulcan: That's where the word volcano comes from. These things form when molten rock and gases escape from under the Earth's surface. This year, we've talked about the effects of a volcano in Iceland, and more recently about Mount Merapi in Indonesia. Guillermo Arduino tells us about some volcanoes you might not have heard about and why some people actually choose to live near them. (BEGIN VIDEO) GUILLERMO ARDUINO, CNN INTERNATIONAL WEATHER ANCHOR, ATLANTA: Anywhere from 50 to 70 volcanoes erupt every year. Typically, we only hear about them when they impact human lives. In Iceland, a volcano erupted earlier this year with a large enough ash cloud to cause air travel delays throughout Europe. Some scientists say the eruption has ended, since ash was last seen rising from the caldera in June. In some areas of the world, locals are used to volcanic activity. Planchon-Peteroa in Chile has had a plume of gas that rises from a small, steaming crater lake since its eruption in September of this year. In October, a local mining company reported that the plume had changed from gray, which contains ash, to white, which is mostly steam. As of October 27th, the plume reduced in size and the local alert level was lowered. Many people around the world choose to live near these volcanoes because they simply cannot afford to move away, while many stay for the mineral-rich soil that yields better crops. Others profit from the tourism it provides. Tourism dominates the economy surrounding one of the world's most active volcanoes: Kilauea, one of the five volcanoes on the island of Hawaii. Earlier this year, lava flows threatened homes on the big island. There are currently 14 active volcanoes that outline the Pacific Ocean. Three are in Mexico, three in northeast Russia, and one in Japan. And throughout the west Pacific, many islands have formed over the years because of volcanic eruptions. Indonesia currently has three active volcanoes, with Mount Merapi located in one of the world's most densely populated areas. Not only is Merapi spewing gas and ash and halting air traffic, at times it is releasing pyroclastic flows, gases that are so hot they kill anything in their path. (END VIDEO) Blog Report . AZUZ: The question: Was this play we showed you earlier this week smart thinking or a cheap shot? The answers: 90 percent of you favor smart thinking; 10 percent say cheap shot. From Desmond: ""I'm in football myself; this was just smart thinking. Ever heard the saying 'desperate times call for desperate measures?'"" From Joel: ""I've seen many plays like this where the QB gets lit up because the other team's linebacker saw the trick on Sportscenter the night before. It was luck."" Camille said ""most plays and fakes are just part of the game, but this had nothing to do with skills or how well you could throw a ball, but just how sneaky you could be."" Before We Go . AZUZ: Always appreciate your blog comments at CNNStudentNews.com. We also appreciate the iReports that you send in. We've been showing those at the beginning of our program, but the one we have today had a little something extra. Take a look. CHRIS GOLEM, LOURDES HIGH SCHOOL SOCIAL STUDIES TEACHER: Every semester, my students here at Lourdes High School in Oshkosh, Wisconsin dream of being on CNN Student News. And Carl, let me tell you why they should be. Option A: That's where we watch Student News every single day. Option B: The Shoutout Hall of Fame. You're looking at past champions. Each semester we compete for the Shoutout Belt. TWO UNIDENTIFIED MALE STUDENTS: We're not the only ones pumped for CNN Student News. CLASS: Carl Azuz is awesome! UNIDENTIFIED MALE STUDENT: Just like Fridays! Goodbye . AZUZ: ...Just like you guys. That was fantastic! Although I hope the pressure to win that Shoutout belt doesn't make anyone buckle.

"(CNN Student News) -- November 8, 2010 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • India • Haiti • New York, New York . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Hope you're rested up and that you had a great weekend -- it was an hour longer at least! I'm Carl Azuz welcoming you to this November 8th edition of CNN Student News! First Up: President Visits India . AZUZ: President Obama is on the road; he's taking a 10-day trip throughout Asia; he's visiting India, Indonesia, South Korea and Japan. He arrived in the Indian capital on Sunday -- you see him here with the first lady -- and one of the first things he pushed for was increased trade between India and the United States. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: I'm here because the partnership between India and the United States, I believe has limitless potential to improve the lives of both Americans and Indians, just as it has the potential to be an anchor of security and prosperity and progress for Asia and for the world. AZUZ: But American critics are concerned about American jobs when it comes to India. The president says that a healthy relationship between the two countries will create American jobs, but critics say it's actually the opposite when U.S. businesses outsource jobs to the southeast Asian country. Hurricane Tomas Impact . AZUZ: Hopelessness: That's the word that pretty much describes the feeling in many parts of Haiti. This is a small, and very poor, Caribbean nation that has endured a catastrophic earthquake, spreading disease, and most recently this year, a glancing shot from Hurricane Tomas. So it may not come as a surprise why many of the people in this report by Paula Newton seem to have just given up. (BEGIN VIDEO) PAULA NEWTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: And then came Hurricane Tomas. Misery now overwhelms Haitians, just as easily as the flood waters did. CHARLIE SIMOLIEN, LEOGANE RESIDENT [TRANSLATED]: This water now came by and washed away anything we had left. NEWTON: Young Charlie Simolien wades through filthy water only to return to his earthquake ravaged home. This is Leogane, the very epicenter of January's epic quake, and now, it has seen some of the worst flooding. And yet for this, there is gratitude .Tomas spared them the worst. This is what the Estin family has been left with. There is water all over their home and this muddy soot, they are thankful that the water has started to recede but now they're left with this muddy soot. And so they try to clean up and recover once more. Many tell us, they've had it, their spirit broken. The quake, the continuing threat of cholera, the indignity of scavenging to survive, and now more water. Jesner tells us he lost his leg to the earthquake, now Tomas has taken everything else. JESNER, LEOGANE RESIDENT [TRANSLATED]: This is all I could save, my crutches. NEWTON: It's difficult to comprehend that in the shadow of homes crushed by the quake, Haitians must now somehow survive. So little has changed here since January. Outside Haiti there is talk of donor fatigue, but inside Haiti, they're sick of something else: all the attention. They say it raises their expectations for help, and crushes them once more when it fails to turn up. UNIDENTIFIED MALE [TRANSLATED]: We always have foreigners come and talk to us and offer help, they take our stories, they take advantage of us and it's about time this ends. NEWTON: Hurricane Tomas' last lash may be behind them but many Haitians tell us they no longer believe anyone can help them when the next calamity strikes. (END VIDEO) Is This Legit? CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is This Legit? A marathon is 13.1 miles long. Not legit! A marathon is twice this distance: 26.2 miles from start to finish! New York Marathon . AZUZ: Temperatures in the low forties, 26 miles of non-stop running: The New York City Marathon isn't for the faint of heart -- or foot. On the other hand, Edison Pena doesn't seem to be faint of anything. He was one of the 33 Chilean miners who spent 69 days trapped underground. And he actually trained while he was down there, running miles through the mine tunnel every day! Pena hit the New York pavement on Sunday along with more than 40,000 other competitors. The winners were also from abroad: An Ethiopian man who'd never run a marathon before had a time of two hours and eight minutes. And the women's winner, a Kenyan, finished in about two hours, 28 minutes. Pena managed to finish the race in 5 hours and 40 minutes, which was a little faster than he expected. Discovery Stays Put . AZUZ: This isn't where Space Shuttle Discovery was supposed to be by now; it should have been docked at the international space station. But its launch was delayed again on Friday because of a hydrogen leak found near one of Discovery's fuel tanks. This happened after gas leaks, electrical problems and bad weather. All that caused earlier delays of the 39th mission of the soon-to-be terminated shuttle program. Discovery is NASA's oldest, and most experienced, shuttle; its first mission was in 1984. After finding the hydrogen leak, scientists expect it'll be November 30th, at the earliest, before Discovery flies again, on what is supposed to be its last mission. This Day in History . (ON SCREEN GRAPHIC) November 8, 1793 -- The Louvre, France's renowned museum, opens to the public . November 8, 1837 -- Mount Holyoke Seminary, America's first college dedicated exclusively to women, opens in Massachusetts . November 8, 1895 -- Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen discovers X-rays while researching electric current . Shoutout . CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for the Shoutout! Who said, ""Nothing ever comes to one, that is worth having, except as a result of hard work""? You know what to do! Was it: A) Booker T. Washington, B) Benjamin Franklin, C) George Washington Carver, or D) Thomas Edison? Three seconds, and GO! Booker T. Washington was talking about raising money when he wrote these famous words. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Career Connections . AZUZ: Examples of how hard work pays off can be seen in our ""Career Connections"" segment with our own associate producer, Tomeka Jones. Tomeka? TOMEKA JONES, ASSOCIATE PRODUCER: Carl, those words you mentioned-- ""hard work""? Well, the professionals we've talked to strongly believe in it. This week, the spotlight is on production assistant Monique Smith. She says being a P.A., well, it's all about what you make it. And she knows it's putting her on the right path to achieving her goal of being a producer. (BEGIN VIDEO) MONIQUE SMITH, CNN PRODUCTION ASSISTANT: My role is to basically do whatever the producers need me to do. That can include anything from logging to making sure I have all the stuff ready for the editors to go through. First of all a SOT is sound on tape. Logging is transcribing or writing down word for word what everybody is saying., so the reason that we're able to pick the pieces of sound that we do is that somebody has to actually go through and write down everything that was said in that entire piece of video. Creating a precut is getting that piece of video or that piece of sound that we plan on airing ready for the editor. All the things you learn as a production assistant, none of your time is wasted. You learn so many basic, good skills that you're going to have to use for the rest of your career. So when you're a producer you basically make the judgment calls on what you're going to put in that show that day. But you can also look back on your production assistant days, remember when you were doing all that logging and making all those numbers and you can think, hmm, now I know what all that stuff was for. The advice that I would give is if your school has a broadcasting program make sure you are in that program. Find out what your passion is, because whenever you find out something that you really feel strongly about and you have a good background in it, whatever you decide to do it won't feel like work. It will feel like something you're doing for fun because you're interested in it. (END VIDEO) Before We Go . AZUZ: Historians don't know why there were so few Honus Wagner baseball cards. Wagner was a speedy shortstop nicknamed ""The Flying Dutchman,"" played from 1897 to 1917, mostly with Pittsburgh. He was in the very first World Series ever, had more than 3,400 hits, and appears on one of the rarest cards on the planet. This particular card was left to a group of Catholic nuns by one nun's brother. They put it up for auction last week and the card brought them almost 263,000 dollars! Goodbye . AZUZ: That money will pay for their charity work in 35 countries so you can understand why the honus was on them to sell the card. All right, if you didn't get that, or like it, we'll just have to take another swing tomorrow. For CNN Student News, I'm Carl Azuz.","Learn what President Obama talked about on his visit to India .

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. UNIDENTIFIED STUDENTS: Welcome to CNN Student News with Carl Azuz! CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Now that is how you get a show poppin'! Thank you gentlemen very much. Welcome, all of you, to a new week of CNN Student News! I'm Carl Azuz, and we thank all our viewers from all over the world for tuning in. First Up: Unemployment Report . AZUZ: The first Friday of every month, the U.S. government usually announces the current unemployment rate. Bad news: This past Friday's announcement came as a surprise; the rate went up to 9.8 percent. It had been 9.6 percent for several months. Some experts were predicting it would stay the same. More than 15 million Americans looking for work, not good news. But there are some people who are actually encouraged by the increase. The unemployment rate only counts people who are actively looking for jobs. So if the rate goes up, it could mean that Americans who'd stopped looking think they have a better chance of finding work, so they're back on the job hunt. Still, analysts say it is disappointing the overall job market hasn't gotten better. Afghanistan Visit . AZUZ: President Obama is back in Washington after a trip to Afghanistan. He made a surprise visit there on Friday, meeting with thousands of U.S. troops. This is his second trip to Afghanistan since he became president. Dan Lothian has more on the president's time in Afghanistan and why it didn't go exactly as planned. (BEGIN VIDEO) DAN LOTHIAN, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: It was a secret trip the White House says was in the works for more than a month; flying into Bagram Air Base for a little more than four hours to salute the men and women who are carrying out the administration's stepped-up strategy in Afghanistan. BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This part of the world is the center of a global effort where we are going to disrupt and dismantle and defeat al Qaeda and its extremist allies, and that's why you're here. LOTHIAN: But ahead of a mid-December review, what is being called a comprehensive assessment to possibly tweak the president's policy there, challenges remain. There's rampant corruption in the Afghan government, highlighted by leaked state department cables in which Ambassador Carl Eikenberry is said to be concerned about ""how to fight corruption when key government officials are themselves corrupt."" And then there is the continued Taliban threat. OBAMA: You're going on the offense. I'm tired of playing defense. Targeting their leaders. Pushing them out of their strongholds. LOTHIAN: Mr. Obama had planned on flying to Kabul to meet with President Hamid Karzai and visit U.S. embassy employees. But a storm rolled in with high winds, dust and low cloud cover, so his helicopter trip was canceled, and the Karzai meeting became a 15-minute phone call. The president did visit wounded troops at a base hospital, awarding five Purple Hearts, and met with members of the 101st Airborne Division who lost six members in a deadly attack earlier this week. OBAMA: There are going to be difficult days ahead. Progress comes at a high price. LOTHIAN: Thirteen hundred U.S. troops have been killed in Afghanistan since the war began. This year was especially deadly. The Obama administration plans to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in July 2011, and a stable, reliable government there is key to meeting that deadline. As for whether or not those WikiLeaks documents could cause more problems for the Obama administration, one top aide says that they've weathered these kinds of revelations in the past and that there's no secret about the challenges they're facing in Afghanistan, especially when it comes to corruption in the government there. Dan Lothian, CNN, the White House. (END VIDEO) Tax Vote in Senate . AZUZ: Moving to the legislative branch of U.S. government and the debate over some tax cuts we've been talking about recently. These are cuts that were made under President George W. Bush. They are set to expire. If they do, it means Americans' taxes will go up. Everyone seems to be in favor of extending the cuts for families who make less than $250,000 a year. The debate is over extending those tax cuts for families that make more money than that. Saturday, the U.S. Senate voted not to extend the cuts for anyone, but Democratic and Republican leaders are hopeful they they can still work out a compromise. Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mr. Study's social studies classes at Shallotte Middle School in Shallotte, North Carolina! Which of these words means a fee that countries have to pay when they import something? Is it: A) Default, B) Inflation, C) Subsidy or D) Tariff? You've got three seconds -- GO! The fee or tax on products that are imported is called a tariff. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Trade with South Korea . AZUZ: A new deal between the U.S. and South Korea would get rid of a lot of tariffs. President Obama announced the plan on Saturday. Over the next five years, it would eliminate 95 percent of the tariffs on industrial and consumer products that South Korea imports from the United States. The president says this agreement will mean billions of dollars in American exports and support 70,000 American jobs. Other folks don't see it that way. In fact, they argue that this trade agreement will actually cost U.S. jobs. The president had hoped to finalize the deal with South Korea when he was in that country last month. There were some disagreements about specific details that caused the delay. Albania Flooding . AZUZ: Albania is a country in southeastern Europe. It's a little smaller than the U.S. state of Maryland, and it's home to about 3 million people. 12,000 of them have had to leave their homes because of this: massive flooding caused by severe rain. You can see some of the damage in these photos sent in by an iReporter. Huge areas of land are underwater. Thousands of homes have flooded. Officials have declared a state of emergency, and troops and police are helping out in the rescue efforts. Israel Wildfire . AZUZ: Israel's cabinet has promised speedy relief to victims of a deadly wildfire in that country. The prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, says he wants the people who were affected to be able to go back to their homes or to alternative housing within days. The fire broke out on Thursday. It's killed at least 40 people and injured at least 17 others. As of Sunday, it was still burning in a few places, but authorities said the major sources had been extinguished. Israel is getting help from other countries, including the U.S., Egypt and Jordan. And Palestinians -- a group that's often at odds with Israel -- are helping out here too. Sound Check . TRENT MITCHELL, SHORECREST HIGH SCHOOL VIDEO TEACHER: You will see the kids walking, you know, kind of looking down and texting away, when there's 50 kids around them they could be talking to. NICHOLI WYTOVICZ, SHORECREST HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT: I Facebook after I get home from school, and then I do my homework, and then I Facebook some more. MARA HARRIS, SHORECREST HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR: I'm not on it 24/7, but I could cut back. I know my mom would love it. Social Experiment . AZUZ: All right, if that sounds familiar, we're all guilty of this at some point or other. As you can see from our stack of smartphones and cell phones right here, technology and social networking are everywhere. But for one week, there's a school district in Washington state that's going unplugged as part of a social experiment. And this is what we mean by unplugged: More than 400 students, teachers and staff have promised to give up texting, Twitter, Facebook and cell phones! The teacher who came up with the idea says people are losing the ability to have face-to-face communication. Students have been promoting the experiment on Facebook. Go figure. All of it starts today. The students who are taking part are on the honor system, but they've given their cell numbers to teachers who will use ""spies"" to try and test them. Blog Report . AZUZ: We're covering this on our blog today; you probably guessed that already. But about Friday's blog on a high school football player who got flagged after praying in the end zone, Rebecca says she would not stop pointing to the sky after scoring. She would let go of the ball first, though, since that's supposedly what triggered the flag. Laurie's class agreed with dropping the ball first, writing that ""people of faith should be able to show it, but they still have to follow rules."" Salicia, like several of you, talked about the First Amendment and said ""the player had every right to say a prayer."" Look at this: 93 percent of you thought Ronnie Hastie should not have been penalized for what he did. Jackson says it's offensive on the ref's part because it's like he's saying ""no following religion on a football field."" Ryan says ""the player wasn't celebrating; he was thanking God. As a football player myself, they should get rid of that rule altogether."" Quick reminder for you: We only publish comments with first names; we only read first names on the show. Before We Go . AZUZ: All right, today's Before We Go segment is about someone who's just a giant baby. A giant panda baby. Well, he's kinda cute now. He only weighs about 2 pounds. Just wait 'til he's full-grown and weighs 200 pounds! This little guy is just a month old. We'd like to tell you his name, but he won't get that until he's 100 days old. That's a tradition in China, where pandas are from. This check-up was to make sure he's healthy, in good shape, and eating well. Goodbye . AZUZ: You know, all the bear essentials. That about cub-bers it for today's program. We hope you have a great day. For CNN Student News, I'm Carl Azuz.","Find out why President Obama's trip to Afghanistan didn't go as planned .

"(CNN) -- Rutgers University held an emotional vigil Sunday evening as the campus grapples with the suicide of a student whose sexual encounter with another man was broadcast online. The body of Tyler Clementi, 18, was recovered from the Hudson River on Thursday, more than a week after he jumped from the George Washington Bridge, which spans the river between New York and New Jersey. Two other Rutgers students -- Clementi's roommate, Dharun Ravi, 18, and Molly Wei, 18 -- have been charged with invasion of privacy. The pair allegedly placed a camera in Clementi's dorm room without his knowledge and then streamed his sexual encounter online, according to the Middlesex County, New Jersey, prosecutor's office. ""Our entire campus is very upset about what happened,"" said Greg Blimling, Rutgers' Vice President of Student Affairs. ""The entire campus is in mourning. And we feel very deeply for what happened to the family. This is a terrible tragedy."" Students and other members of the university community, some wearing pins that read ""Pride,"" stood silently as they lit and held white candles. Clementi remembered in New York Park . The vigil brought together student organizations, campus offices and LGBT communities ""as an opportunity for the members of the community and our allies to stand together united in peace, healing and social justice,"" a statement from the university said. A student who attended the vigil stressed the need for civility. ""We're all linked on some sort of deeper level and we just need to find it,"" said Caroline Tuero. On Friday, the president of Rutgers pledged to meet with members of the university's gay community as the school deals with scrutiny in the wake of the suicide. In a letter to the Rutgers community, President Richard McCormick praised what he called the school's ""strong history of social activism on behalf of diversity."" However, he said, the university ""is an imperfect institution in an imperfect society."" University officials declined to respond to CNN's questions about when Rutgers first learned of the webcam incident, citing privacy laws. But a school spokesman said Friday that officials ""did the best they can."" ""I have spoken to virtually every principal involved in this matter, and they have attempted to handle this matter to the best of their ability,"" Rutgers spokesman Greg Travor told CNN. McCormick said that the incident has raised questions about the campus climate. ""Students, parents and alumni have expressed deep concern that our university, which prides itself on its rich diversity, is not fully welcoming and accepting of all students,"" the president said in a letter. New Jersey prosecutors were working to determine whether additional charges, including bias, may be brought against Ravi and Wei. On the evening of September 19, Ravi allegedly sent a message via microblogging site Twitter about Clementi. ""Roommate asked for the room till midnight. I went into molly's room and turned on my webcam. I saw him making out with a dude. Yay."" Ravi tried to use the webcam again two days later, on September 21, according to the Middlesex County prosecutor's office. ""Anyone with iChat, I dare you to video chat me between the hours of 9:30 and 12. Yes it's happening again,"" Ravi is believed to have tweeted. The next day, Clementi was dead. A mobile status update September 22 on a Facebook page purportedly belonging to Clementi said: ""jumping off the gw bridge sorry."" Clementi's family has remained largely quiet, except to say that their personal tragedy has raised a host of legal issues for the country. ""Regardless of legal outcomes, our hope is that our family's personal tragedy will serve as a call for compassion, empathy and human dignity,"" the statement said. CNN's Ross Levitt contributed to this report.","Tyler Clementi committed suicide after the broadcast of a sexual encounter with a man .

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARMEN SMITH (DOROTHY): The city of Leeds, Alabama. CARSYN WHITEHEAD (TIN MAN): Home of the Mighty GreenWave. CARMEN SMITH (DOROTHY): I'm Dorothy! CARSYN WHITEHEAD (TIN MAN): I'm the Tin Man! ALLYSON BROWN (COWARDLY LION): I'm the Cowardly Lion! STEPHANI PAYNE (SCARECROW): And I'm the Scarecrow! ALL: And you are about to enter the wonderful world of the wizard Carl Azuz and CNN Student News! CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: All right, forget Fridays. That was awesome! Thank you guys so much for submitting that! We've got 10 minutes of commercial-free headlines before we hit the yellow brick road, so let's go ahead and get rolling! First Up: Midterm Elections . AZUZ: Four days! That's all the time that midterm candidates have left to convince Americans to vote for them. Win or lose in next Tuesday's midterm elections, running for office comes at a price. You've got to produce TV ads, you've got to make signs, pay a staff. All of that adds up. Dana Bash takes us out on the campaign trail to look at the money trail and see how much is being spent and where it's all coming from. (BEGIN VIDEO) DANA BASH, CNN SENIOR CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Sure, there's a lot of money flowing in this year's election. But exactly how much being spent is mind blowing: $4 billion dollars. To put $4 billion in context, that's enough to send about 80,000 students to Princeton for a year. It could buy every person in America three Big Macs with fries at McDonald's. Four billion is far more than the $2.85 billion spent in the last midterm election in 2006, and dwarfs the $1.61 billion spent little more than a decade ago in 1998. OpenSecrets.org compiled the figures in a new report. SHEILA KRUMHOLZ, CENTER FOR RESPONSIVE POLITICS: The stakes are so high this cycle that it's not surprising that there's an intensity to this cycle that was perhaps reduced or missing in the last cycles. BASH: Though much of the four billion is spent by candidates themselves, an eyepopping amount is coming from outside candidates' campaigns; political parties and independent groups. $430 million dollars in overall outside spending. Only $31 million was spent in 2002, less than a decade ago. And despite Democrats' complaints about being outspent, when it comes to political parties, Democrats are winning. All told, the Democratic Party has raised $782 million dollars. A lot more than the Republican Party, at $515 million. But GOP outside groups, with ads like this, are making up for that gap and then some. Although Democratic groups are catching up, they're being outspent by GOP counterparts 2-1. Another fascinating 2010 trend: key industries moving campaign cash from Democrats to Republicans. Take the health care sector. When the president took office, two thirds of its dollars were going to Democrats. Since health care passed, the industry is giving 60% to Republicans. The same goes for money from Wall Street and the energy sector. Just last year, both gave mostly to Democrats. Now, 67% of Wall Street money goes to Republicans. The energy sector: 74% to Republicans. KRUMHOLZ: I think they've got their finger in the air. I think they're looking at the changing poll numbers and seeing that the Republicans have a clear shot at taking the majority, particularly in the House. (END VIDEO) Indonesia Disasters . AZUZ: Following up on some international headlines for you now, beginning in Indonesia. Earlier this week, the nation suffered through an earthquake, a tsunami -- a giant ocean wave caused by the earthquake -- and a volcanic eruption. Officials are trying to get help to the victims of these natural disasters, but that's been tough with all the disasters they've had to deal with. Plus, Indonesia is made up of thousands of islands, and some of those are hard to reach. Here, you can see a plane dropping aid in one of the areas that was affected. Other groups are using boats, but those deliveries can take hours. Some of the most immediate needs: clean water, food, blankets and medical attention. Cholera Outbreak . AZUZ: In Haiti, officials are trying to figure out what started an outbreak of cholera. They're testing waste and sewage water for the bacteria that causes the disease. The outbreak, meanwhile, is getting worse. Workers are trying to fight it. One of the problems in that fight is that a lot of people in Haiti are living in tents after January's earthquake. They need medical supplies to survive, but some people can't get them. Dr. Sanjay Gupta is in Haiti trying to find out why. (BEGIN VIDEO) DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: How could this have happened? That's what Julie Santos wants to know. JULIE SANTOS, MEDICAL RELIEF WORKER: You have someone there, someone here. Let's connect the dots. GUPTA: She's talking about trying to contain the outbreak of cholera. Hundreds have died, thousands still in need of treatment. This is where you're told to come get supplies. You arrive here, and if there's patients waiting, what happens? SANTOS: Well, there are patients waiting. GUPTA: There's patients waiting for these supplies? SANTOS: Yes, when we were sending them out to the hospitals out in Saint Marc. GUPTA: Where patients are literally begging for hydration, clean water, the cheapest of supplies. And yet medical relief worker Julie Santos still waits for hours for her paperwork to be approved before she can get the supplies. I wanted to try and understand myself. Promise warehouse, a World Health Organization facility, has the largest stockpile of supplies here in Haiti. What people have been waiting for, for hours outside and days in hospitals is this: pallets of I.V. fluids; literally, life-saving stuff to treat these patients with cholera, thousands of them. But it's not just that pallet. You take a look at this whole warehouse, full, despite what's happening here in Haiti. CHRISTIAN MORALES, PAN AM HEALTH ORGANIZATION/WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION: If we send everything that we have here today, tomorrow we cannot answer for 800,000 cases in Port-au-Prince. GUPTA: Christian Morales has the enormous task of helping figure out who gets the supplies and when. Did it go fast enough? MORALES: They, they, I think in every operation like this, you can do things better. And there's a lot of lessons to be taken from this. And the country needs to be prepared for what is coming, because the likelihood of spreading of this epidemic is very high. GUPTA: That's something we heard over and over. This epidemic is by no means over. (END VIDEO) Just the Facts . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Just the Facts! The Great Depression was the longest and worst economic crisis in U.S. history. It started in 1929 and lasted around a decade. During this period, unemployment climbed to more than 25%, thousands of American banks failed, and U.S. industrial production was cut almost in half. The Depression was felt around the world and led to significant changes in economic theories and policies. This Day in History . AZUZ: A major event that helped plunge the U.S. into the Great Depression happened on this very day in history: October 29th, 1929. Or as a lot of people know it, Black Tuesday. Wall Street, the stock market crashed, and hard. More than 16 million shares of stock were traded. Stock tickers, the machines that people used to read stock prices, couldn't keep up with all the trading. They fell hours behind. Billions of dollars were lost on Black Tuesday, and thousands of investors were completely wiped out. Shoutout . JOHN LISK, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mr. Gardner's U.S. studies classes at Indian Valley High School in Gnadenhutten, Ohio! The word ""tuition"" can be traced back to what language? Is it: A) Greek, B) Roman, C) Latin or D) Aramaic? You've got three seconds -- GO! Tuition, what you pay for instruction, comes from Latin. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Cost of College . AZUZ: The word ""increase"" comes from latin, too. And that is what tuition is doing right now; it's going up. Probably not a big surprise. The cost of college has been increasing for years. What's interesting is that tuition at public schools is going up faster than it is at private schools. A lot of that has to do with states struggling financially. The higher tuition costs help make up for money that schools aren't getting from their states. Look at the numbers here. In-state tuition at a four-year public school is around $7,600 per year. That's up nearly 8 percent from last year. At a four-year private school, tuition is a little more than $27,000 per year. That's up 4.5 percent from last year. Facebook Chat Promo . AZUZ: You see this guy? He could be talking to me on Facebook! So can this young lady right here. You all can! On Monday, I will be live at Facebook.com/cnnstudentnews in the school year's very first Facebook conversation we're having! You post your questions to our wall, I'll answer as many as I can as fast as I can! The date is Monday, November 1st, 6:30 p.m. Eastern. The address: Facebook.com/cnnstudentnews. Before We Go . AZUZ: Now, before we go today, you always want to try your best in any race. But you might want to give it a little something extra in this one. You're gonna need to make sure to stay ahead of the rest of the contestants. Unless you want to be eaten by zombies! These guys take that ""walking dead"" nickname pretty literally. More than 200 ghouls gathered for this zombie walk in Kentucky last week. Goodbye . AZUZ: Organizing that many zombies in one place takes a lot of brains. But no matter witch costume you wear or whether you're just planning on goblin up candy, it ghost without saying that we wish you happy and safe Halloween. I'm Carl Azuz, for CNN Student News!

"(CNN Student News) -- October 5, 2010 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • Washington, D.C. • Germany • Massachusetts . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Broadcasting from the CNN Center in Atlanta, Georgia, CNN Student News is ringing the bell! It is my job and pleasure to be your anchor -- I'm Carl Azuz. In the next ten minutes, we'll bring you up to speed on today's headlines. First Up: Community College Plan . AZUZ: First up -- McDonald's and Gap -- they're two of the businesses that are getting involved in a new education plan by President Obama. It's called ""Skills for America's Future."" And its purpose, according to the president, is to link up community college students with the businesses that could hire them. So one part of this, for example: Gap, the clothing business, says it plans to start offering community college students the chance to build their skills and possibly get jobs down the road. While talking about this, the president, who's a Democrat, spoke out against Republicans, saying they are trying to cut education from the government's budget by 20 percent, in order to save money. A Republican representative says it's President Obama's government spending that threatens education by creating debt that today's students will have to pay for. Shoutout . CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mrs. Schweizer's  Academic Stretch classes at LaSalle Springs Middle School in Wildwood, Missouri! The 1919 Treaty of Versailles officially ended what war? You know what to do! Was it: A) World War I, B) World War II, C) Hundred Years' War, D) or the Spanish-American War? You've got three seconds -- GO! The Treaty of Versailles was the document that brought World War I, or the Great War, to an end. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout. End of Great War . AZUZ: Well, in a manner of speaking, it ended with the Treaty of Versailles. See, World War I was completely over this weekend. You're like, ""what?"" Listen to this: As part of the Treaty of Versailles, Germany -- who was blamed for starting the Great War -- was fined the equivalent of hundreds of billions of dollars. The money was needed to rebuild Europe, parts of which were decimated by shelling, gunning, bombing, in the most destructive war the world had ever seen at the time. But Germany, who'd just been defeated, had trouble paying all that money. And for awhile, under Adolf Hitler, it refused to pay that money. Well, flash forward to the 1990s. Decades after World War II and the division of east and west Germany, the country was once again reunited in 1995. And it took up the job of paying back what it still owed from World War I. The last installment of interest, dating back to the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, was finally paid on October 3rd, 2010. Ocean Census . AZUZ: Well, it was on October 4th, 2010 that results came out from a census on the world's oceans. This took time, work and money: 10 years to survey marine life, 2,700 scientists from around the world, $650 million. It's not easy to take a census of the waters that cover 70 percent of the Earth's surface. Here's the big headline from the report: There are more ocean species than even scientists imagined. One-million-plus, when they used to think there were only a quarter of that! Also interesting -- estimates of what scientists still don't know. For example, more than 16,000 species of fish have been identified. They now think that an additional 5,000 species still haven't been discovered. In the words of one researcher: Life in the sea ""astonished us everywhere we looked."" Bullying in Schools . AZUZ: This week, CNN is focused on the issue of bullying in schools: What causes it and what can be done to stop it. Last school year, we took an informal survey at CNNStudentNews.com asking how many of you had ever witnessed bullying. 87 percent said they had. A student who recently spoke with CNN's Anderson Cooper, described how being bullied made him feel. (BEGIN VIDEO) ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR, ANDERSON COOPER 360°, NEW YORK: Jason, how about you? JASON, BULLYING VICTIM: I guess I was bullied on a regular daily basis from April of last year until the end of this school year. One day this school year now I saw him and he punched me in the throat. That wasn't cool. COOPER: He just punched you. JASON: Yeah. I didn't even see him coming, he just came out of nowhere and hit me. But he would probably just be calling me names, all because I was smarter than him or the music that I listen to. Just pretty much if I was different from him, he would find a name to call me that was related to the difference and just call me that name. And its like after a while, after so much of this stuff they tell you, you start to believe it and you start to think that it's your own fault. Many kids that I know just think that its their own fault so they actually change themselves and change their appearance just to try and fit in. And bullies spawn other bullies because like in the beginning. They pick on other kids to keep themselves from being picked on . COOPER: I wasn't bullied very much in school, but I remember folks who were and I think I was just probably a bystander, I think which makes me probably as culpable as those who bully because I just stood by and just watched other people being bullied. But, meeting the people who were bullies at my high school reunion, and then meeting kids who had been bullied, the ones who had been bullied were actually the most interesting people, because they were the ones who back then were kind kind of different in one way or another and back then difference was made fun of, but in real life, as soon as you leave school, difference is what makes you special and unique and makes you interesting. (END VIDEO) Blog Report . AZUZ: Couldn't agree with him more. At CNNStudentNews.com, we recently asked what you think the worst form of bullying is. The results so far: 35 percent say it's physical bullying. 37 percent say verbal. 28 percent say cyber. One thing you all seem to agree on, what Valerie says right here: ""All types of bullying are horrible. Spreading around rumors can be just as bad as a punch to the face."" Becka agrees. She says ""verbal and physical bullying are worst; they mess with your head and make you think you're worthless."" Lucas feels ""the most common form of bullying has to be verbal. It's hard to prove, hard to catch, and hard to ignore."" Seth says ""cyber and verbal bullying can be shaken off, but physical bullying can leave you with bumps and bruises."" But Grason writes, whoever said ""sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me"" has obviously never been to middle school."" All of you have had very good comments on this subject -- thank you for talking to us about it. Is This Legit? CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? New York's Madison Avenue is a symbol of the U.S. finance industry. Not legit! New York City's Madison Avenue is most closely associated with the advertising industry. Ads on School Notices . AZUZ: It'd be interesting to see what Madison Avenue thinks of this: a school's plan to allow advertisements on the back of school notices that elementary kids take home. So syllabuses, permission slips, notes that kids are given for their parents to look at, those could soon have these on the back: Advertisements for local businesses. This is the plan at Peabody Public Schools in Massachusetts. The reason for it, we've covered a lot this year. The schools need money, and this is one way to raise it. Here's how a member of the Peabody School Committee explained the reasons behind the plan. DAVID MCGENEY, PEABODY SCHOOL COMMITTEE MEMBER: Well, we can only go to the taxpayers so often. They're tapped out. The parents are certainly tapped out, with all of the fees that they're incurring. So I thought it was time to bring in the business element and make it entirely voluntary and try to raise money that way. AZUZ: But the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood is one group that's not on board with this. Here's what they say: ""It is not hard to imagine that students who serve as couriers for ads for pizza parlors and ice cream shops will lobby their parents to go to these locations the second they get home. Participating in this advertising scheme may actually cause a backlash against businesses since parents may view them as exploiters instead of community partners. Blog Promo . AZUZ: You could really go either way on this which is why it makes for a great blog! How would you react if your little brother brought home a permission slip, with an advertisement on the back? Would you feel he's being taken advantage of or that it's a good way for his school to get needed funds? CNNStudentNews.com! Before We Go . AZUZ: Before we go, a tale of two bacons. There's the actor Kevin Bacon and then there's the bacon you put on your salad, or potatoes, or sculpture. The edible icon -- we're talking about the bacon made of bacon, of course -- came from a man at a bacon salt company. He did this to raise money for kids at a children's hospital. The dough he makes from this bacon would be used to buy needy kids balloons, gifts and toys. Goodbye . AZUZ: Who would've thought that bacon, could've been so sweet?

"(CNN Student News) -- November 30, 2010 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • North Korea • Cancun, Mexico . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Glad to see you've tuned back in to CNN Student News! My name is Carl Azuz. We are broadcasting from the CNN Center in Atlanta, G-A! Today's first story has to do with information that was never meant to be seen by the public. First Up: WikiLeaks Release . AZUZ: It was leaked. Like a book of American secrets shared with everyone, all over the internet. The organization that's publishing this information is called ""WikiLeaks."" This is an international, not-for-profit website that posts material, often secret material, that it gets from anonymous sources. They believe the public has a right to know what their leaders are saying. What WikiLeaks is publishing this time around are hundreds of thousands of documents -- communications between Washington and U.S. embassies around the world. They contain classified -- secret -- information about U.S. diplomacy: how American government officials interacted with -- and in some cases felt about -- the government officials of other countries. So why does any of this matter? Well, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, whose interactions with other officials are included in some of these documents, calls their publication illegal. And she says it could threaten U.S. national security and put lives in danger. Plus, it's embarrassing. And it could cause other countries to doubt America's ability to keep secrets. Jill Dougherty delves into the content and criticism surrounding the leaks. (BEGIN VIDEO) JILL DOUGHERTY, CNN FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: The U.S. government has been in damage control all weekend long. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton personally phoning the leaders of eight different countries: Germany, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Britain, France, Afghanistan, China and Canada; assessing the potential impact on relations. The government has been roundly condemning the leaks. There are 250,000 of them, and not all are out at this point. They are on a wide variety of subjects, and some of the most interesting ones deal with the reaction of Arab countries, a critical reaction toward Iran and its nuclear program. Also, ""The New York Times"" reporting that State Department personnel in some cases were asked to provide information from foreign diplomats about things like frequent flyer numbers and credit card numbers. P.J. Crowley, the spokesperson for the State Department, saying in a tweet, our diplomats are that, they are diplomats, they collect information. They are not, as he put it, intelligence assets. Now, what could be the potential damage? Well, one U.S. official telling me it could be hugely damaging to the United States, but some of that will depend on what other governments, governments around the world, will be saying. And I have been speaking with some embassies here in Washington. They are saying that they are still studying the documents, and we can certainly expect a lot more. (END VIDEO) Federal Wage Freeze? AZUZ: U.S. government workers, like Secretary Clinton, President Obama, FBI employees and park rangers, may not be getting a pay raise for the next two years. That's a proposal from the president himself who says this is about getting the government deficit under control and that the sacrifices made would have to be shared with government employees. The government's deficits -- how much more money it spends, than it takes in -- are expected to exceed nine trillion dollars over the next decade. So how much would freezing government wages save? About 60 billion over the next ten years. Not a significant amount of money when compared to the overall deficit. But one analyst called the proposal a ""psychological first step."" It's also not set in stone; Congress would have to approve this before it could take effect. Back in Session . AZUZ: And that is one of the many things the lame duck Congress started considering as lawmakers got back to work yesterday. One major decision they're facing this week: the federal budget -- what to spend where, in order to keep the government operating. Some other things they'll have until year's end to decide: Will the government keep taxes the way they were after President Bush cut them? Will the government extend benefits to people who've been without jobs? And it will be interesting to see what sort of compromises are in the December air because things are changing in January: The new House will be controlled by Republicans, while Democrats will maintain a slim lead in the Senate. Shoutout . CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mrs. Thompson's 6th grade classes at Philomath Middle School in Philomath, Oregon! Which of these countries borders North Korea to the north? Is it: A) China, B) Thailand, C) Mongolia or D) Vietnam? You've got three seconds -- GO! China shares most of North Korea's northern border. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Korean Peninsula Crisis . AZUZ: China is also North Korea's closest ally, which is why China factors in to the crisis on the Korean Peninsula. It's calling for an emergency meeting of six countries, to discuss the best ways to ease tensions in the Korean region. But the U.S., one of those six countries, says a meeting is no substitute for North Korea changing its behavior. North Korea is furious over military exercises being done by South Korea; in response, North Korea attacked a South Korean island last week. South Korea says if the north attacks again, it will respond firmly. On Sunday, the U.S joined South Korea's military exercises in the Yellow Sea. Climate Change Conference . AZUZ: There are 194 countries represented right now in Cancun, Mexico for the latest United Nations Climate Change Summit. They're hoping for an international agreement on reducing carbon emissions. These are released into the air when we burn gas, oil or coal. And many scientists blame carbon emissions for affecting the Earth's climate, though others say humans have little or no effect on the climate. Hard to say if there'll be any breakthroughs at the summit. Not much came out of last year's meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark. And part of the reason for that: Different carbon limits are suggested for different countries, and not everyone agrees on what those limits should be. Is This Legit? CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is This Legit? To live in the U.S. legally, you must be a U.S. citizen. Not legit! The U.S. government offers people ways to legally work and live in the U.S. without being citizens. DREAM Act . AZUZ: But those who are in the U.S. illegally may face deportation: being sent back to their home countries. An interesting sticking point in the debate over illegal immigrants, is this: What happens to their children? Not those who were born on U.S. soil; they're citizens. But those who were brought here as kids: Should they be allowed to stay? Susan Candiotti illustrates why there's so much disagreement over this question. (BEGIN VIDEO) SUSAN CANDIOTTI, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: For 19-year-old Joanna Kim, America is home. Her parents moved to New York from South Korea when she was eight. JOANNA KIM, COLLEGE STUDENT: My first memory was when I first came here and my dad took me on a ferry here near where the Statue of Liberty is, and we went around. And it was snowing that day so it was extra beautiful. CANDIOTTI: It was 1999. The World Trade Center is seen over her shoulder. But from the time she was little, she was told to keep a secret. Her family was in the U.S. illegally. The college honor student is now fighting deportation. Her status is tied to her divorced father, who's had no contact with Joanna and her mom since moving back to South Korea years ago. Her only hope is the DREAM Act. Tossed around like a football in Congress for a decade, it would allow students such as Joanna to become permanent residents if they came to the U.S. as a child, attend college or serve in the military and are of good character. Joanna Kim's undocumented status prevented her from getting into Ivy League schools but she's attending a state university on scholarship. KIM: I'm still working on a career that I want, to go into medicine. CANDIOTTI: DREAM Act opponents are urging defeat in a lame duck Congress. WILLIAM GREEN, AMERICANS FOR LEGAL IMMIGRATION: Illegal immigrants aren't supposed to be rewarded with citizenship, voting rights and college educations and financial aid paid for by me and my family and my grandparents. Illegal immigrants are supposed to return home. (END VIDEO) Web Promo . AZUZ: Tell us what you think of this story on our blog! It's live at CNNStudentNews.com.

Just how do you keep your upper lip warm in that sort of weather? You grow a sweater for it! This was characterized as history's hairiest hockey game. Two reasons for this moustache mayhem: One: ""Movember"" -- a group that encourages moustache manifestation in November to raise money for cancer research. Two: Try to set a record for the most moustaches in one place. Goodbye . AZUZ: Some of those guys say moustaches are a must, so don't you give them any lip.

"(CNN Student News) -- October 4, 2010 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • Europe • North Carolina  • Little Rock, Arkansas . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: It's the first full week of October, and we are ready to kick it off with 10 minutes of commercial-free headlines. My name is Carl Azuz. Hello and welcome! You've found your way to CNN Student News! First Up: Europe Travel Alert . AZUZ: First up, a highly unusual travel alert from the U.S. government. It's telling Americans who are in Europe -- or who are going there -- to be on guard. The reason: intelligence that indicates the potential for a terrorist attack. This goes back to a story we told you about last week: concerns that al Qaeda or another terrorist group might be planning some kind of attack in Europe. The U.S. government says it's not telling people, ""don't to go to Europe."" But if they do go, they should be careful while they're there. For example, the travel alert recommends that Americans be cautious if they decide to ride public transportation or visit tourist sites like the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France. The alert also suggests that if Americans see anything suspicious or hear loud noises, they should move away as fast as they possibly can. Flooding in N.C. AZUZ: In the United States, parts of the East Coast are suffering from some severe flooding that hit the area over the weekend. Some of the rain that caused the floods came from what was left over of Tropical Storm Nicole. Officials say at least 8 people were killed. North Carolina took some of the worst of the severe weather. Roads were wiped out, businesses and houses were underwater. Look at this! You can see how high the water got, how it totally covered a street. In some spots, the water was even as high as the stop signs. In one North Carolina town, officials were trying to make sure that all the animals in the zoo got to higher ground. They evacuated most of the animals, but there were three water buffalo that had to be set free. Those were found later on a hill nearby. One Nation Rally . AZUZ: ""One nation working together."" That was the theme of a rally in Washington, D.C. on Saturday. You can see some of the crowd gathered around at the Lincoln Memorial. This rally was organized by the One Nation movement. It's a political movement with a lot of smaller groups all coming together for big events like this one. The One Nation group says it's pushing for things like better jobs and changes to America's immigration and education policies. It planned Saturday's rally to kind of show off its strength one month before this year's mid-term elections. Shoutout . APRIL WILLIAMS, CNN STUDENT NEWS: It's time for the Shoutout! How many justices are there on the U.S. Supreme Court? If you think you know it, shout it out! Is it: A) 5, B) 7, C) 9 or D) 12? You've got three seconds -- GO! The Supreme Court has one chief justice and eight associate justices; a total of nine. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! New Session Begins . AZUZ: All nine of those justices are back on the bench today as the U.S. Supreme Court kicks off a new session. This is the first session for Elena Kagan; you might remember us covering her nomination several months ago. During a ceremony last Friday, Kagan was officially welcomed as the newest associate justice on the nation's High Court. The docket for this session, what the Supreme Court will hear and rule on, has been more or less in place since February, though it can be added to after that. It includes some interesting cases. For example, is it legal to ban the sale of violent video games to anyone under 18? The court will also look at the issue of immigration and consider whether federal laws should overrule state laws. Space Week . AZUZ: Something else starts this week: it's World Space Week. It happens every year from October 4th to the 10th. The United Nations established World Space Week to help teach people about space exploration and to encourage support for space programs around the world. The United Nations picked October 4th because it's significant: It's the anniversary of Sputnik! On October 4th, 1957, Sputnik became the first man-made satellite to be launched into space. In 2004, on the same day -- October 4th -- SpaceShipOne was awarded the Ansari X-prize; it was the first private, or non-governmental, manned space flight. What's the Word . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: What's the Word? no longer around; vanished or non-existent . EXTINCT . That's the word! Back from the Brink . AZUZ: Well, you've probably spent some time in your science classes learning about different kinds of animals that have gone extinct. Dodo birds and dinosaurs are some of the more famous ones. But some scientists are warning people not to throw around that extinct label too quickly. The reason? Well, we'll let Max Foster tell you about that; he shows us some scientific examples of lost and found. (BEGIN VIDEO) MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR: Back from the dead! A new study by the University of Queensland says that more than a third of mammal species, like this okapi, once considered extinct or missing in the wild have eventually been rediscovered. Though they thrive in zoos around the world, okapi are native to the Congo, where they were found in 2006 for the first time in fifty years. That's a relatively short period though of ""extinction,"" especially compared to this massive fish called a coelacanth. Experts thought it had died out with the dinosaurs before it was found swimming off the coast of South Africa in 1938. From all corners of the animal kingdom, and the plant kingdom too, these species have defied declarations of extinction: a small frog in Africa, a short-necked beetle in Britain, rare flowers and ancient trees. All of these were once labeled lost to history and later turned up, alive and well. The study acknowledges a lot of effort is being wasted trying to find animals that are truly gone forever, like the Tasmanian tiger, that died out more than 70 years ago. But perhaps the searching will pay off someday for other creatures that appear to have vanished, but perhaps are just waiting to be found again. Max Foster, CNN, London. (END VIDEO) Blazing Trails . AZUZ: High school on Friday, college on Saturday, the pros on Sunday. If you have a friend or a relative who's been spending weekends in front of the television, might be because it's football season! In Arkansas, two players are making a name for themselves under the Friday night lights. That's partly because of their names: Mandi and Sarah. One school district, two schools, two different girls who are both playing varsity football. Lauren Trager of affiliate KARK tackles the story. (BEGIN VIDEO) MANDI NORTON, LITTLE ROCK MILLS HIGH JUNIOR, RUNNING BACK: It's not about boys and girls, it's just about the game and what we are out here doing. LAUREN TRAGER, KARK 4 REPORTER: A love of the game; it's what Jacksonville High senior Sarah Moncrief and Mills High junior Mandi Norton have in common, first and foremost. But compared to their teammates, they're quite different. The only girls in a boys' game. SARAH MONCRIEF, JACKSONVILLE HIGH SENIOR, DEFENSIVE AND OFFENSIVE TACKLE: I've always loved it, said I was gonna do it. Last chance. TRAGER: For these ground-breakers, it took all kinds of guts just to get up the courage. MONCRIEF: I didn't know how the guys would take it. TRAGER: Then to make it through two-a-days. NORTON: It's not as hard as people make it seem; it's really easy. You just have to try and put your best foot forward. PATRICK RUSSELL, LITTLE ROCK MILLS HIGH COACH: I'm from the old-school, I guess you could say, and so having a female on the football team was not something I was looking forward to. TRAGER: Both coaches had their reservations. Special accommodations in equipment and locker rooms were made, but these girls proved their muscle. RICK RUSSELL, JACKSONVILLE HIGH COACH: She got in our off-season program, lifted weights, ran and got bigger and stronger. Excuse me, she got stronger. I better not say that for Sarah. She got stronger, more agile. TRAGER: Now, they're just one of the guys. SHALEEK DOE, JACKSONVILLE HIGH, SARAH'S TEAMMATE: You have some times where you forget that she's a girl and you just treat her like another football player. TRAGER: At least on the field. Mandi's boyfriend is number 51. NORTON: He's proud of me and he supports me probably more than anyone else in my life except for my dad. TRAGER: Like other new players, they don't see a ton of game time. But they have a newfound notoriety, perhaps winning over a few of the skeptics. COACH P. RUSSELL: She's fit in and I'm proud of her. TRAGER: Maybe blazing the trail for others to come. MONCRIEF: I think it's just a time for us to change and say that we can do what we want to do just as well as anybody else. (END VIDEO) Before We Go . AZUZ: All right! Before we go, we're showing you pictures of a New Mexico festival that's really full of hot air. In this case, that's a good thing. It's the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta. Fellow flyers flock from around the globe to New Mexico for nine days every year. When this thing started back in 1972, 13 balloons -- that was it! -- 13 balloons took off from a mall parking lot. Now, there are so many balloons that they need a launch area that's the size of 54 football fields! Goodbye . AZUZ: We guess you could say the fiesta has ballooned out of control. But getting to watch all those things take off could really inflate someone's spirits. Time for us to go. Man, we're sorry. We'll be popping back tomorrow to launch into another edition of CNN Student News. I'm Carl Azuz. We'll see you then.","Hear why the U.S. government wants Americans in Europe to be on guard .

"(CNN Student News) -- September 30, 2010 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • Cape Town, South Africa • Chile . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Officials think they've uncovered a terror plot that was targeting Europe. That story leads off this Thursday edition of CNN Student News. From the CNN Center, I'm Carl Azuz. First Up: Europe Terror Plot . AZUZ: Well, that terror plot, one source says the information comes from a man who was arrested in Afghanistan. He offered up some details about a ""Mumbai-style"" attack in Europe. When we say that, we're talking about the terrorist attack that happened in Mumbai, India two years ago. That is when ten men launched an attack that lasted three days and left more than 160 people dead. This man who told officials about the plot is a German citizen. He was arrested in Afghanistan back in July and is now in U.S. custody. He went to Afghanistan last year and joined a group that's connected to the al Qaeda terrorist group. European officials are looking into the information that they're getting. But German and U.S. officials say, so far, they haven't found any evidence of an imminent attack either in Europe or the United States. Is This Legit? TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? The first lady is a member of the U.S. president's Cabinet. Not true! The first lady can play a big role in a presidential administration, but she is not a Cabinet member. School Lunches . AZUZ: First ladies do have a lot of influence, and they can use that to make an impact on laws and policies. For example, first lady Michelle Obama's big push is to fight childhood obesity. And one of her goals is for Congress to pass a new child nutrition law. We're talking about the school lunch program. It hasn't been updated in about 5 years. This new bill that the first lady is pushing for would offer money to poorer districts to help pay for free meals, and it would require healthier foods in school programs. But it doesn't look like this thing's gonna become law anytime soon. You see, the money for these new programs would come from the food stamp program, and some Democrats think that should be off-limits. One Congressman said, ""We're not going to tolerate robbing the poor to pay for every piece of legislation."" Fast Food Toy Ban? AZUZ: We've been talking this week about how healthy eating means making choices. You guys can make those decisions for yourselves or talk to your parents about making them. But kids who are younger than you, maybe your little brothers and little sisters, might not know about choosing healthy foods yet. They might just want whatever meal has a toy with it. And that's why some California officials are considering a ban on including toys with some fast food meals. David Stevenson of affiliate KTVU serves up the details. (BEGIN VIDEO) ERIC MAR, SAN FRANCISCO SUPERVISOR: These toys that are used too often as incentives to lure and entice children to the meals. DAVID STEVENSON, KTVU REPORTER: Happy Meals went on trial in San Francisco. JUANITA ALVARODO, SAN FRANCISCO MOTHER: The toy that comes in that unhealthy Happy Meal? There comes a price. STEVENSON: The county's Land Use and Economic Development Committee heard from consumers and McDonald's executives on a proposal to ban restaurants from selling meals with toys like these, unless the food meets certain nutritional standards. MAR: Meals must contains fruits and vegetables and not exceed 600 calories, and must not have beverages that have excessive fat or sugar. STEVENSON: Health advocates say fast food restaurants use these promotional toys to lure low-income children into diets high in sugar, fat and salt. JAMILAH TOOPS, SAN FRANCISCO RESIDENT: The youth in my community are getting diet-related diseases, like diabetes and hypertension, at younger and younger ages. KAREN WELLS, MCDONALD'S CORPORATION USA, VICE PRESIDENT OF NUTRITION: We can use the toy in our advertisement to promote and educate on nutrition. We advertise our all-white-meat nuggets, our apple dippers, our low-fat white milk. STEVENSON: The McDonald's corporation flew in executives from Chicago to tout what they describe as healthier menu options and to oppose the measure. WELLS: I'm a parent. I have two small children. I decide what my children will eat and what toy or what the environment will be. And so, banning or putting legislation that undermines what parents choices are, we believe are wrong. STEVENSON: Scott Rodrick owns ten of San Francisco's 19 McDonald's restaurants. He calls the legislation proof of the city's misplaced priorities. SCOTT RODRICK, MCDONALD'S FRANCHISE OWNER: With the limited resources that our city has today, we should be focused on the greater issues: a public safety program that works. (END VIDEO) Shoutout . STAN CASE, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to the students and teachers at Hempfield High School in Landisville, Pennsylvania! Cape Town, Pretoria and East London are all cities in what country? Is it: A) Mauritania, B) South Africa, C) Madagascar or D) Great Britain? You've got three seconds -- GO! You'll find those cities in South Africa. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Township Baseball . AZUZ: South Africa played host to this year's soccer World Cup Championship. Those of us who watched it still hear the horns. But there's another sport, one from America, that's gaining popularity in parts of South Africa, including the Cape Town area. And people aren't just focused on what's happening on the field. It's about the sport keeping young people away from stuff off that's off the field, too. Nima Elbagir explains what we mean. (BEGIN VIDEO) NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT, CAPE TOWN: Philippe Township on the outskirts of Cape Town, just off the glossy, double-lane highway leading into South Africa's second city. Like many of the other townships ringing Cape Town, the lucky few live in government-built housing. But the vast majority live in shacks. Hundreds of thousands of families with no power, no heat and no running water. South African Townships, like the one behind me, are an incredibly difficult environment for young men. Guns, drugs, crime and a host of other temptations are a daily reality here, but an American import is now offering them a surprising alternative: baseball. Coach Nyameko Gabada introduced the game here four years ago after South Africa did well in the world baseball classic. NYAMEKO GABADA, BASEBALL COACH: I was staying here in Philippe. I found out that it's a lot of crime that is abusing the children of this place. ELBAGIR: While baseball has gained some popularity in South Africa in more affluent areas with access to international sports channels, in the townships, it was all but unheard of. And Coach Gabada said he banked on that novelty to draw in the children. GABADA: Once we started, then they came in interest. Everybody wants to see what is this baseball. And then they started coming in numbers! ELBAGIR: But once the team, the Philippe Angels, was up and running, their success has surprised even the coaches. ROB ROSENBLUM, BASEBALL COACH: The very first season, we started with two teams: under-twelves and under-fourteen. And amazingly, the under-fourteens won their league and the under-twelves came in second. And so, you can imagine the impact that had in the community, where these kids came home with a big trophy and ran around the community celebrating and everything. ELBAGIR: In a neighborhood where there is often little worth celebrating, the teams' success has had a huge impact on the children's confidence and aspirations. LAZOLA NDLANGALAVU: This township, very lot of drugs, bad things happening now. But now, if you do sports, and then you can stop doing drugs, all that stuff, bad stuff. ELBAGIR: And it's not just on the sports field that trophies are being won. To play baseball here, you also commit to academic tutoring. It's already paying off for some of the older children. ROSENBLUM: It's the commitment to something bigger than yourself. It's the hard work, the discipline, everything that comes from that. You transfer that to the rest of your life and you've got a much better chance. And when somebody comes up to talk, they don't say, ""Thank you for spreading baseball."" They don't say anything like that. What they say is, ""Thank you for getting these kids off the street."" ELBAGIR: Nima Elbagir, CNN, Cape Town. (END VIDEO) Chile Mine Rescue . AZUZ: From South Africa to South America for an update on those 33 men trapped in a mine in Chile. They're not out, not yet. But there is some progress in the rescue efforts. One of the drills that's making a hole big enough for these guys to get out hit the halfway point yesterday. That's something. Officials are looking at early November for when they think the rescue operation will actually happen. Before We Go . AZUZ: Before we go, I'm Carl Azuz, and you're watching CNN Student News! Now, you hear me say something like that just about every day to introduce the show. Now, we want you to do it! This is what we talked about yesterday. We want you to introduce CNN Student News!

AZUZ: If you're pundering how to do this, just take a little time for introspection. All right, you know we were gonna have some sort of pun there, but we really are looking forward to what you come up with. And plus, it'll give me a break at the start of the show, and I'd appreciate that. We thank you for tuning in today.

"(CNN Student News) -- September 7, 2010 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • New Zealand  • Guatemala • Chile . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Well, there's a new technology out that makes annoying noises to try to stop people from loitering. But is it targeting teens? You'll hear all about it in today's edition of CNN Student News. You viewers who've been with us since the beginning of the school year: We hope you had a good Labor Day weekend. To you viewers who are just joining us: Welcome to a new year and a new year's worth of news from CNN Student News. I'm Carl Azuz. Let's go ahead and get started. First Up: Focus on the Economy . U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Eight million Americans lost their jobs in this recession. And even though we've had eight straight months of private sector job growth, the new jobs haven't been coming fast enough. Now, here's the honest truth, the plain truth: there's no silver bullet; there's no quick fix to these problems. AZUZ: President Obama, spending part of the Labor Day weekend talking about jobs in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It's part of a White House plan to put a spotlight on the U.S. economy. During yesterday's speech, the president talked about transportation projects: rebuilding roads, building and maintaining railways, working on airport runways. He says that all of that would help create jobs and help the country's economy. Now creating jobs, definitely a big priority. The government just released the latest unemployment numbers last week. And unemployment is at 9.6 percent. That is up one-tenth of a percent from the previous month, and it's been right around that same range since May. Congress would have to approve all of the president's proposed transportation projects. And some analysts don't think there's any chance of that happening soon. A recent CNN poll shows almost 60 percent of Americans disapprove of how President Obama is handling the economy. Forty percent give him a thumbs up. Midterm Elections . AZUZ: Jobs and the economy: probably going to be big factors in this year's midterm elections. We are less than two months away from the big day, November 2nd. No one's running for president, but there are a lot of congressional seats up for grabs. That includes every seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, all 435 of 'em. Plus, 37 of the 100 U.S. Senate seats, and 37 states will be electing governors, too. So, where do things stand? In a new CNN/Opinion Research Corporation Poll, around 1,000 people were asked what's called a ""generic ballot"" question. It doesn't have names on it; it just asks, ""Would you vote for a Republican or a Democrat?"" 52 percent said they would vote for a Republican. 45 percent said they'd vote for a Democrat. Back to that point about the economy being a major concern. According to another CNN poll, 81 percent of Americans think the U.S. economy is in poor shape. 18 percent think that the economy is doing well. Those opinions, probably gonna impact how some people vote. Blowout Preventer Raised . AZUZ: You see that thing coming out of the water? It's called a blowout preventer, and it's supposed to shut down an oil or gas well if anything goes wrong. This one didn't; it failed, and a lot of experts think that's what led to the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Officials who are investigating that spill want to examine the blowout preventer to find out why it failed. A new one is in place on top of the oil well. Once it's been tested and approved, authorities can drill the last few feet of a relief well that's gonna seal up the original well for good. I.D. Me . JOHN LISK, CNN STUDENT NEWS: See if you can I.D. Me! I'm an island nation that's located in the South Pacific Ocean. You'll find me southeast of Australia, my biggest trading partner. I'm home to about 4 million people, who are sometimes called Kiwis. I'm New Zealand, and my capital city is Wellington. New Zealand Quake . AZUZ: Parts of New Zealand are trying to recover from a massive earthquake that hit over the weekend. A couple people had serious injuries. Around 100 others had minor bumps and cuts. Luckily, there were no immediate reports of any deaths. But there is a lot of damage, as you can see here. The government has gotten 5,000 claims for damaged properties. A lot of those are for houses. The earthquake had a magnitude of 7.1. It struck early Saturday morning. There have been some pretty strong aftershocks since then, too. Experts say those aftershocks could keep coming for a week. Guatemala Landslides . AZUZ: Over in the Central American nation of Guatemala, people are struggling through the strongest rain in 60 years. More than 40,000 Guatemalans are at risk. What happens is the powerful rain storms cause landslides. Dozens of Guatemalans have been killed or hurt. In one spot, a landslide knocked some vehicles off the road, and when people nearby came to help, another one hit the exact same location. Thousands of homes have been damaged. Fields full of crops have been washed out. The country's president declared a national emergency over the weekend. He also said Monday would be a day of mourning. Chile Miners . AZUZ: In Chile, officials are working to get 33 men out of a mine they've been trapped in for more than a month. These officials have a plan, a back-up plan, and a back-up, back-up plan. And they're gonna run all three at the same time. You can see the miners in this video. They seem to be in good spirits. Now, Plan A is to drill straight down to the shelter these guys are in. That could take several months. Plan B is to drill at an angle. That could take about half the time. Plan C is to use an oil drill. That could be the fastest option, but it won't be ready until later this month. What's the Word? TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: What's the Word? to hang around or stay in one place for no apparent reason . LOITER . That's the word! Anti-Loitering Device . AZUZ: So, loitering might not seem like a big deal. We've all probably spent time hanging out at the mall. Store owners might see loitering differently. If you're loitering, more often than not, you're not shopping. And in some cases, loiterers can drive away business. One mall is trying a sonic solution to drive away loiterers. But as Brian Todd tells us, some people are sounding off in opposition. (BEGIN VIDEO) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT, WASHINGTON, D.C.: It can cause a high-pitched headache, and that's by design. Just outside the Gallery Place subway stop in Washington, the Mosquito beeps often. But is it indiscriminate? This anti-loitering device was placed here after a big street brawl, but the property managers and the Mosquito's distributor both tell CNN the noisemaker doesn't target young people. Still, the distributor says teenagers happen to do the most loitering, and he says the sound is most effective for the stage of life when humans can hear the highest pitches. MIKE GIBSON, MOVING SOUND TECHNOLOGIES: The Mosquito, when activated, emits a sound at 17.5 kilohertz, which is at the high end of the youth hearing range, 13 to 25-year-old hearing range. When a youth hears the sound, they find it extremely annoying and will leave the area in a few minutes. TODD: At Gallery Place, we saw some young people getting irritated. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Can you hear it? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Probably wouldn't shop at any of these shops if I heard it again. TODD: Why not? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's too annoying. It gave me a headache. TODD: There are settings on the Mosquito that can be heard by older age groups. I played the sound off a computer in our newsroom near several people in their 20s, 30s and older. I didn't tip them off beforehand. On settings for people 25, 30, 35 and younger, no one reacted. Then... We're going to play a setting now for people 50 years old and under. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh, I heard that. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I hear that. TODD: I can hear that, too. Still, some believe this device does target teenagers unfairly. Among the community leaders who have concerns about this device, Judith Sandalow of the Children's Law Center here in the Gallery Place area. Judith, if there are problems with violence and loiterers driving away customers from businesses that count on that business in this area, wouldn't anything like this help? JUDITH SANDALOW, CHILDREN'S LAW CENTER: I'm sympathetic to businesses needing to be able to engage the most customers in the best possible way. I'm sympathetic to that. This isn't the best solution. We need to have better programs for youth; we need to engage them in activities. (END VIDEO) Before We Go . AZUZ: Finally today, before we go, ever seen a black widow take down a buffalo? That's what happened this weekend in Buffalo, New York. All right, so we're talking about buffalo wings, not a full bison. But these guys -- and gal -- can pack 'em away. In fact, Sonya Thomas -- she's known as the Black Widow -- ate 181chicken wings in 12 minutes. That's enough to take home the title and beat her own world record. Goodbye . AZUZ: We actually didn't plan any puns for this story, so I guess I'm just gonna have to wing it. She buffalo'd the competition? She obviously had a wing-ing strategy. That whole event looks like a three wing circus! Maybe we'll just chew over the possibilities. Either way, we'll be back tomorrow. Hope you will too!

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Hi, I'm Carl Azuz. If there's one thing I'm sure of, it's that Fridays are awesome! And this Friday edition of CNN Student News is about ready to take flight. First Up: U.N. General Assembly . U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Peace must be made by Israelis and Palestinians, but each of us has a responsibility to do our part as well. Those of us who are friends of Israel must understand that true security for the Jewish state requires an independent Palestine, one that allows the Palestinian people to live with dignity and opportunity. And those of us who are friends of the Palestinians must understand that the rights of the Palestinian people will be won only through peaceful means, including genuine reconciliation with a secure Israel. AZUZ: There were a lot of subjects that President Obama talked about yesterday at the United Nations General Assembly. He discussed the economy, the environment, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But the main focus of his speech was what you just heard him discuss: efforts to create a peace deal between Israelis and Palestinians. There's been tension between those groups for decades. President Obama says it's time for them to come together. One quick note on that speech: The Israeli representatives weren't there while President Obama was talking. That's because it was a Jewish holiday. Pledge to America . AZUZ: Well, Republicans in Congress are making a pledge to America. They announced it yesterday. It's essentially a promise to try to change some government policies. House Minority Leader John Boehner explained why they came up with it. REP. JOHN BOEHNER, (R) MINORITY LEADER: Our government is out of control in Washington, and we need to reign it in and begin a new drive for a smaller, less costly and more accountable government in our nation's capital. These are the things that the American people are demanding, and our pledge to America is that the Republicans stand ready to get it done. AZUZ: Democratic leaders say the pledge will take Americans back to old policies that they claim didn't work in the first place. The pledge includes things like cutting taxes and some government spending. It also takes aim at the new health care reform law. Jim Acosta has more on that. (BEGIN VIDEO) CHRISTINE O'DONNELL, (R) DELAWARE SENATE CANDIDATE: I would fight to repeal the bill. JIM ACOSTA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It's a GOP battle cry for the midterm elections. SEN. JOHN MCCAIN, (R) ARIZONA: The American people will be heard, and we'll repeal and replace. SHARRON ANGLE, (R) NEVADA SENATE CANDIDATE: I have pledged as my first act of legislation to put in a repeal ObamaCare law. ACOSTA: If Republicans win a majority of seats in Congress, one of the first things they promise to do is repeal President Obama's signature achievement: health care reform. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What's your response to that? ACOSTA: Under a new GOP-controlled House, Texas Congressman Joe Barton would likely become chairman of a key House committee overseeing health care. He says hearings would begin as soon as January to dismantle the law. REP. JOE BARTON, (R) TEXAS: If we're given the opportunity to be in the majority, we are going to try to repeal it and then replace it... ACOSTA: Right away. BARTON: ...with something that makes sense. Well, the sooner the better. ACOSTA: That threat comes as new portions of the law go into effect this week. Provisions that stop insurers from denying coverage to children with pre-existing conditions or dropping policies for people who get sick. Big expansions of coverage don't come until 2014. Still, recent polls show the law remains unpopular. REP. GLENN NYE, (D) VIRGINIA: I voted against the health care bill because I thought it would be too expensive. ACOSTA: Even some Democrats are running against it. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius argues the public will come around. Why is this law so unpopular? KATHLEEN SEBELIUS, HHS SECRETARY: I think it's more confusing than unpopular. I think that... ACOSTA: You're ready to have this debate all over again? SEBELIUS: I am indeed. OBAMA: Hello, hello, hello. ACOSTA: So is the president, who points to parts of the bill that are popular. OBAMA: If young people don't have health insurance through their employer, then they can stay on their parents' health insurance up to the age of 26. ACOSTA: Parts Congressman Barton wants to keep. Are there portions of the law that should be kept? BARTON: I think coverage of pre-existing conditions. The ability to keep your insurance and not have it revoked unless... ACOSTA: Rescissions. BARTON: ...unless you committed fraud. ACOSTA: Other Republicans say scrap the whole thing. Conservative activist Alex Cortes, with the group defundit.org, says the solution is to starve the law of money. ALEX CORTES, DEFUNDIT.ORG: One of our only options is defunding. Go after some of the smaller provisions. We will not let Kathleen Sebelius implement and enforce this law. (END VIDEO) Just the Facts . STAN CASE, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Just the Facts. A concussion is an injury that affects how your brain works. They're usually caused by a hit to the head, but you don't have to lose consciousness to have a concussion. Symptoms can include dizziness, nausea and confusion. Concussions can affect your memory, reflexes, speech and balance. And if you've had a concussion, you're more likely to suffer another one. Concussion Hearing . AZUZ: Those things are serious. You hear about concussions in pro sports. Younger athletes suffer these head injuries as well. You might know someone who's had a concussion. Between 2005 and 2008, an estimated 400,000 concussions happened in high school sports. Congress wants to find a way to cut down on concussions. Yesterday, they heard from medical experts, parents, students and pro athletes about the issue. Congress is thinking about passing a law that would require student athletes who suffer head injuries to get checked out before they can get back on the field. The bill would also require schools to train coaches, students and parents about how to deal with concussions. This Day in History . [ON SCREEN GRAPHIC] .

September 24, 1957 -- Federal troops go to Little Rock, Arkansas to enforce the right of black students to attend a public school . Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for the Shoutout! What kind of animal is a pangolin? If you think you know it, then shout it out! Is it a: A) Bird, B) Fish, C) Mammal or D) Reptile? You've got three seconds -- GO! Pangolins are mammals that are mostly found in Asia and Africa. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Plight of the Pangolin . AZUZ: Now before you say that's kind of a funny looking creature, there may be a point where there aren't very many left to look at. Pangolins are in danger of dying out. In parts of Asia, the animals are hunted illegally for their meat and for the scales that cover their bodies. Dan Rivers shows us how some people in Vietnam are trying to help the pangolins survive. (BEGIN VIDEO) DAN RIVERS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, VIETNAM: Pity the pangolin, but most people have never even heard of one, let alone seen one of these endangered ant-eating mammals. The way things are going, they may become famous because there are none left. Two species are especially under threat in Asia: the Chinese pangolin and the Sunda pangolin. Experts say both are being hunted to extinction. LEANNE CLARK, WILDLIFE CONSERVATION SOCIETY: I think we're going to watch those species, both species disappear over the next 5 to 10 years if we don't do anything, which is intensely sad. You know, they were listed as common until fairly recently. RIVERS: It's why this special pangolarium has been built in Vietnam's Cuc Phuong National Park. Staffs are trying to rehabilitate rescued pangolins, which are notoriously difficult to keep. But at least here they are safe from the poachers who prize their meat. CLARK: They're such an interesting little mammal, you know. It's devastating to think that these animals, you know, might go extinct while we're watching if we don't do enough. RIVERS: At the rescue center, they are hoping to slowly start releasing captured pangolins after they've been given a clean bill of health. But they need funding and more staff to ensure these creatures don't disappear completely in just a few years' time. Dan Rivers, CNN, Cuc Phoung National Park, Vietnam. (END VIDEO) Shoutout Promo . AZUZ: We haven't had any Shoutout dedications this semester. That's because we're waiting on you! Teachers, there's only one way to get a Shoutout. Log on to our page, CNNStudentNews.com, go to the ""How do I"" box, and click on ""How do I get a Shoutout."" Send us an iReport with a photograph of your school, and we'll take it from there. Before We Go . AZUZ: Before we go, wouldn't it be cool to kinda just watch TV at your job? Hey, ladies, get back to work! They are at work. This farm in Russia -- yes, it's near Moscow -- set up plasmas as part of an experiment to see if the cows would make more milk if they were watching TV. It turns out they do! Experts think watching pictures of pastures helps relax the cows -- we're not making this up -- and that this puts them in the right mood for milking. It starts with TV. Goodbye . AZUZ: But you know they'll eventually want to watch moo-vies. They should milk this thing for all it's worth, make the farmers cow-tow to them for a while. We'd do it if we cud.

"(CNN) -- Spanish driver Nani Roma upstaged the pre-race favorites to set the early pace at the Dakar Rally in Argentina on Saturday. The day was marred by the death of a spectator who, along with other spectators, was struck during the race's first stage. The others were being treated for ""slight injuries,"" according to a statement by race organizers on the event's Web site. The incident involved German driver Mirco Schultis and Czech partner Ulrich Leardi, the organizers said. Read more about spectator fatality at Dakar Rally . Roma, who was 10th overall last year after being hit with a late time penalty, was the leading car driver in the first stage from Colon to Cordoba. The 37-year-old, who won the motorbike class in 2004, was two minutes and seven seconds ahead of compatriot and two-time world rally champion Carlos Sainz in a Volkswagen. Roma's BMW team-mate Stephane Peterhansel, a total nine-time winner of the endurance event in the car and bikes categories, was a further 43 seconds adrift following the 199-kilometer stage. Defending car champion Giniel De Villiers was four minutes and 31 seconds adrift in a Volkswagen in fifth, behind teammate Nasser Al-Attiyah of Qatar, while NASCAR racer Robby Gordon was sixth in a Hummer. ""In the end we were quite surprised by the time we achieved,"" Roma told the race's official Web site. ""But I'm happy. We had a fright with the engine in the middle of the special stage and had to stop to make a few checks. But everything was running okay. I think it was an electrical problem, but since it was working, I preferred not to interfere with anything. ""It's only just the start. We haven't really had a battle with the VWs yet. There is still a lot of the race to go. In any case, it was a good special stage for warming up."" David Casteu also upset the favorites as he led the motorbike class by a small three-second margin from fellow Frenchman Cyril Despres, with defending champion Marc Coma 12 seconds back. Riding a 450cc machine in comparison to his rivals' 690cc KTM bikes, Casteu won a stage in the race for just the second time. ""I was riding at 150 kmph, but the bike held stable and is coping well. I hardly used any petrol. In fact, I had three times too much,"" he said. Poland's Rafal Sonik headed in the quad class, with fellow Yamaha rider Marcos Patronelli trailing him by one minute and 55 seconds. Russia's Vladimir Chagin led the truck category by 27 seconds from Ales Loprais of the Czech Republic. The 14-stage race finishes in the province of Buenos Aires on January 16, having also traveled into neighboring Chile. The event was staged in Africa and Europe until last year, having been canceled in 2008 due to security concerns.","NEW: Day was marred by death of spectator struck by a vehicle .

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: I'm Carl Azuz and you're watching CNN Student News! Today's headlines, no commercials. Bringing you stories from all over the U.S. today, and we start things off in Colorado. First Up: Colorado Wildfires . AZUZ: That's where authorities are trying to put out a wildfire that's been burning for a couple days now. The state's governor has declared a state of emergency. The fire is near the city of Boulder. Around 3,500 people were told to leave their homes, and school was canceled in the area. As of yesterday afternoon, there hadn't been any reports of injuries. Planes, like the one you see here, are dropping fire retardant, chemicals that are used to try to put out the fires. The planes can only fly in certain conditions, though, so if the weather gets bad or the wind picks up, that can be problematic. Officials say that more equipment and more firefighters are heading to the area to help out with the efforts there. Tropical Storm Hermine . AZUZ: These images were taken in Texas on Monday night. They give you an idea of the conditions caused by Tropical Storm Hermine. This storm made landfall near Brownsville. It got weaker as it moved across the state, but Hermine still dumped huge amounts of rain on parts of Texas. Forecasters expected some areas to get up to 10 inches of rain. And in the southern part of the state, Hermine threatened what are called ""storm surges."" Those can raise water levels; in this case, maybe as much as 3 feet. Just the Facts . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Just the facts. The Quran is the holy book of the Islamic religion. Its name comes from an Arabic term that means ""the recitation."" The Quran is made up of 114 chapters, which are divided into different verses. It includes specific laws and rules for Islamic society, as well as guidance for Muslims about their daily lives. Quran Controversy . AZUZ: The Quran is a big part of a protest that's scheduled for this Saturday. The Dove World Outreach Church in Gainesville, Florida is planning to burn Qurans. Terry Jones, the church's pastor, says the protest is aimed at Islamic extremists, not at all Muslims. And he acknowledges that it'll make some people upset. TERRY JONES, CHURCH PASTOR, DOVE WORLD OUTREACH: We feel that the message that we are trying to send is much more important than people being offended. We believe that we cannot back off of the truth of the dangers of Islam, of the dangers of radical Islam just because people are going to be offended. AZUZ: A lot of people are criticizing this idea to burn Qurans. That includes other religious leaders. Some of them came together in Washington, D.C. yesterday to speak out against the plan. DR. GERALD DULEY, PASTOR, PROVIDENCE MISSIONARY BAPTIST CHURCH, ATLANTA, GA: Religious leaders denounce anti-Muslim bigotry and call for respect for America's tradition of religious liberty. As religious leaders in this great country, we have come together in our nation's capital to denounce categorically the derision, misinformation and outright bigotry being directed against America's Muslim community. AZUZ: Another group that's spoken out against this is the U.S. military. In a statement, General David Petraeus -- he's the U.S. commander in Afghanistan -- said burning Qurans ""could endanger troops and it could endanger the overall effort in Afghanistan."" Blog Promo . AZUZ: Well, there are always interesting comments on this, not only from the people involved in the story, but from you. We've put up a post on our blog at CNNStudentNews.com where you can talk this story, you can talk about how you feel about it. This Day in History . GRAPHIC: . September 8, 1504 -- Michelangelo's ""David"" statue is unveiled in Florence, Italy . September 8, 1565 -- St. Augustine, Florida, the oldest city in the U.S., is established .

September 8, 1998 -- Mark McGwire breaks Roger Maris' record for the most home runs in a single season . Is This Legit? JOHN LISK, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? Worldwide, one out of every 10 adults is illiterate. Not legit. It's actually twice that many -- one out of every five adults -- who can't read or write. International Literacy Day . AZUZ: Some surprising numbers, and those are part of the reason why the United Nations created International Literacy Day. It's designed to raise awareness about literacy needs around the world. The theme of this year's event is ""Literacy and Women's Empowerment."" According to the U.N., two-thirds of the world's illiterate adults are women. The organization says that literacy is a basic human right because it's the main tool for learning. CEO Principal . AZUZ: Sticking with the education theme, different teachers have different teaching methods. You know that; you're aware of it; you see it all the time. In Japan, one principal is running his school like a business. And based on his students' test scores, it's working. Kyung Lah shows us how he's making the grade. (BEGIN VIDEO) KYUNG LAH, CNN CORRESPONDENT, TOKYO: The school day begins at Wada Junior High with drills; math drills, as fast as these kids can do them. The theory here: train the brain with drills, much in the same way puzzles may prevent dementia among the elderly. Principal Akihisa Shirota believes it so much, he joins the students. School curriculum is the basics, plus lessons from real-world business and community leaders to show kids where the basics will take them. Revolutionary for a Japanese school system known for rigidity and formality. But Shirota is not your average principal. He's not even a trained educator. He's a businessman who started and then ran publishing at high-tech companies. His lack of experience in this setting is what led the school to recruit him. ""Principals are people who became teachers right after graduating from college,"" says Shirota. ""That limits any outside the box thinking,"" he explains. He runs the school more like a corporation; students, his workers. And he keeps track of them. You know all the names of all the students. PRINCIPAL AKIHISA SHIROTA, WADA JUNIOR HIGH: No only name, but also their testing score. LAH: You know their test scores and their names? SHIROTA: Yes, yes, yes. LAH: Every single one. SHIROTA: All of them. LAH ""He's different,"" says a student. ""More like a friend sometimes, but still the boss."" In the three years since Shirota has been principal, the school claims higher test scores. The result, he believes, of a number of innovations. It's 6:40 in the evening and students are still here at Wada Junior High School. The reason why: night school is about to begin. This is an unusual move by this public school to try to boost its test scores. It's where I meet 15-year-old Koya Nakamora. ""We start at 7:00 p.m.,"" Nakamora explains. He's been in school since 8:00 in the morning and leaves at 9:30 at night. Critics call this too tough for a public school, but Shirota says the old must give way to new thinking. And other educators in the country are taking note. The bottom line, says this former businessman, if Japan's corporations must adapt and compete in a global economy, it only makes sense that, so too, must Japan's schools. Kyung Lah, CNN, Tokyo. (END VIDEO) Off the Beaten Path . AZUZ: Well, it is time for our first field trip of the school year: Off the Beaten Path. Turns out, people had a lot of time on their hands over the long Labor Day weekend. (BEGIN VIDEO) AZUZ: Honestly, who doesn't dream of being a champion arm wrestler? Okay, don't answer that. Just arm yourself for a battle of the biceps! At Canada's National Arm Rasslin' Championships, it's about technique. For some, it's all in the wrist. For some, it's in speed. And for some, it's in the face. Would you wanna hold hands with this guy? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When they mean redneck festival, they mean redneck festival. AZUZ: But we're not still talking about arm wrestling. We're talking about this: Pennsylvania's annual Redneck Festival! You can ride the bull or barrel. You can shop for jewelry or aluminum. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They sell like hotcakes. AZUZ: But if a ""haybale obstacle course"" isn't your speed, saddle up for a one-wheeled whirl across the Brooklyn Bridge! When you're too coordinated for two wheels, you don't just want to boast balance; you want to show stunts. This person had a ""can-do"" attitude. At least people would hear it if he fell. It's easy to see how all this pedal-spinning can make your head spin. So without a wheel, why not just turn yourself around at a Hawkeye State Hokey Pokey? To get this many people over age 8 to participate, you must be trying to set a record. And they did: a Guinness World Record. More than 7,300 hokey pokers putting their hands into history. That's what it's all about when you journey Off the Beaten Path. (END VIDEO) Goodbye . AZUZ: A world record is always cool, even if group dances are a little hokey. And those unicycle guys are wheelie awesome. Time for us to brake for the day; I know it breaks your heart. CNN Student News returns tomorrow. Have a great one.

"(CNN) -- Massive flooding that has swept through Queensland, Australia, and claimed at least one life will likely force the evacuation of at least 1,000 people and close a regional airport for weeks, an emergency agency said Sunday. The flooding has directly impacted about 200,000 people, according to Emergency Management Queensland, and has affected an area roughly the size of the entire state of New South Wales. Rockhampton, Queensland, is the worst-hit major population center, the agency said. On Sunday, a spokesman for the agency said floodwater is receding in certain areas but is also flooding local towns as is recedes. He said electricity has been intentionally cut in areas of Queensland -- including parts of Rockhampton -- that have been inundated by flooding. Rockhampton's regional airport closed Saturday afternoon and is expected to remain closed for the coming weeks, Emergency Management Queensland said Sunday. Meanwhile, other modes of transportation in the area were essentially reduced to boat travel, as all roads, major highways and the railway leading in and out of the city were flooded. A 41-year-old Queensland woman is the first confirmed fatality of the flooding. The woman, whose name was not released, was traveling with eight family members from Mount Isa to Burketown when the family's vehicles were overrun by flood waters in the town of Floraville, Emergency Management Queensland said. After an air-and-boat search that lasted more than 12 hours, the woman's body was recovered around 10 a.m. Sunday, about 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) from the causeway where she had disappeared, the agency said. All other members of the family were rescued safely. Towns across the northeastern state have been flooded since monsoon rains about a week ago caused rivers to spill their banks and reach record levels. Prime Minister Julia Gillard toured the devastation on Friday and said the flooding in Queensland will cost ""hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars."" Gillard traveled with Queensland Premier Anna Bligh through the sugar-producing town of Bundaberg, where flood waters reached 7.92 meters (26 feet) Thursday. Emergency Management Queensland said about 1,000 people are expected to be evacuated from their homes in the coming days. The agency said some residents were able to leave on their own and move to higher ground before the severe flooding, heeding warnings from authorities. CNN's Andreena Narayan contributed to this report.","NEW: Electricity is intentionally cut in parts of Queensland .

"AMMAN, Jordan (CNN) -- For more than 20 years, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, then the Vatican's top doctrinal czar, was the intellectual architect of the papacy of John Paul II. Pope Benedict XVI and Jordanian Prince Ghazi Bin Talal leave the King Hussein mosque in Amman on Saturday. Thus, when Ratzinger was elected to succeed John Paul as Pope Benedict XVI in April 2005, it was widely seen as a vote for continuity with the late pontiff's policies. Four years later, there's only one strong substantive difference between the two popes, and it's on display this week as Benedict XVI visits Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian territories: their approaches to Islam. With 1.1 billion Roman Catholics and 1.6 billion Muslims in the world, representing about 40 percent of the world's population, it's a difference that matters. While John Paul II was a bridge-builder, Benedict is determined to walk across those bridges, pushing Islam toward a rejection of extremism and an acceptance of religious freedom -- toward an integration of reason and faith. It's an approach that puts its finger on critically important concerns, but one also fraught with potential for conflict. In general, John Paul II was a great pioneer of Catholic-Muslim relations. He met with Muslims more than 60 times over the course of his almost 27-year pontificate, and in 2001 he became the first pope ever to enter an Islamic mosque: the Grand Umayyad Mosque in Damascus, Syria. John Paul's opposition to the two U.S.-led Gulf Wars and his broad sympathy for the Palestinians was also appreciated by many Muslims. Like John Paul, Benedict XVI sees himself as a friend of Islam. Friday in Amman, Jordan, on the first day of his weeklong swing through the Middle East, Benedict reaffirmed his ""deep respect for Muslims."" His broad vision is what he calls growing ""intercultural dialogue"" between Muslims and Christians, which implies an alliance against forms of secularism in the West that the pope regards as hostile to religion. The fact that Benedict XVI has chosen to begin his tour by spending three days in Jordan, which the Vatican has long regarded as a model of Muslim-Christian co-existence, suggests the emphasis he places on Islam. When John Paul came in 2000, he spent just 24 hours here.  Watch a walk through Amman for everday Jordanians' reactions to the visit » . Among other things, Benedict hopes Christians and Muslims will join forces in defense of shared values such as the sanctity of human life and the family, which can translate into political efforts in opposition to abortion and homosexuality. The precedent was set in the mid-1990s, when the Vatican and a bloc of Muslim nations resisted efforts at U.N.-sponsored conferences in Beijing and Cairo to recognize a right to abortion as part of international law. Yet the price of admission to that partnership, Benedict XVI believes, is a reform within Islam that would move it in the direction of a greater capacity for pluralism, including the rights of religious minorities, especially Christians, within Islamic societies. Saturday, for example, Benedict visited the King Hussein mosque in Amman, telling his Muslim hosts that religious freedom ""includes the right, especially of minorities, to fair access to the employment market and other spheres of civic life."" Benedict also argued that much tension between Christians and Muslims is the result of ""ideological manipulation of religion, sometimes for political ends,"" and pointed to what he called ""the fundamental contradiction of resorting to violence or exclusion in the name of God."" To date, Benedict XVI's efforts to convince Muslims that he's advancing these arguments as a friend, from a shared space of common religious concern, have brought mixed results. His famous September 2006 speech in Regensburg, Germany, in which he cited a Byzantine emperor linking Islam to violence, set off wide protests across the Islamic world. Here in Jordan, some leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood have turned a cold shoulder to the pope's visit, insisting that he must apologize anew for the Regensburg address. In effect, one core aim of Benedict XVI's journey this week is to re-introduce himself to the Muslim world, clearing away the debris from what he conceded this morning is ""the burden of our common history."" The drama is whether this 82-year-old pontiff, who has sometimes had his problems with public relations, is able to pull it off.

"(CNN) -- A solitary goal from Karim Benzema kept Real Madrid in touch with league leaders Barcelona on Sunday night as Jose Mourinho's side overcame Mallorca 1-0 at the Bernabeu. The French striker's left-footed effort in the 61st minute ensured Madrid returned to winning ways after a disappointing draw against Almeria last weekend. Mourinho casts doubt on Madrid future . Madrid squandered a host of chances to make the game completely safe and could have dropped further league points as Mallorca put up a spirited fight. Emilio Nsue hit the post after 13 minutes and goalkeeper Iker Casillas saved smartly from Pierre Webo moments before the final whistle. But the home side held on and the win means they remain four points behind Barcelona -- who won comfortably against Racing Santander on Saturday. Barcelona extend La Liga lead . Villarreal came from a goal down to beat Real Sociedad 2-1 and reclaim third place in the table. A brace by Giuseppe Rossi either side of halftime rescued the home side after they fell behind to a Mikel Aranburu goal in the 30th minute. In La Liga's other matches, Almeria beat Osasuna 3-2 to lift themselves off the bottom of the table. Argentine striker Jose Ulloa scored twice to earn the home side their first home league win of the season as they moved up to 18th. Fellow strugglers Real Zaragoza also received a boost with a 1-0 win over Deportivo La Coruna.

The away side had to come from behind after Venezuelan striker Miku Flores put Getafe ahead in the 13th minute. All three of Espanyol's goals came in a frantic 11-minute period after the break. Luis Garcia put them on level terms in the 52nd minute. Seven minutes later Jose Callejon put them ahead and Sergio Garcia added a third in the 63rd minute to stun the home fans. Atletico Madrid lost ground on the Champions League places as they slumped to a 1-0 defeat at Sporting Gijon -- David Barral's goal in the 51st minute proving enough to sink last year's Europa League champions.","Real Madrid back to winning ways with 1-0 win over Mallorca .

"(CNN) -- Carlos Sainz is closing on his first Dakar Rally car title after extending his lead with victory on Tuesday's 10th stage in the South American event. The Spaniard, who led last year's race before crashing out on the 12th stage, was 10 minutes and six seconds ahead of Volkswagen teammate Nasser Al-Attiyah of Qatar after triumphing on the 238-kilometer leg from La Serena to Santiago. It was the two-time world rally champion's first stage win in this year's event and the 16th of his career, and leaves him in prime position to win with three legs to go. Al-Attiyah finished the day in fourth as he lost one minute and 40 seconds to Sainz, but was still more than 18 minutes ahead of third-placed American Mark Miller in another Volkswagen. Miller was third on the stage, with Frenchman Stephane Peterhansel second -- 28 seconds behind Sainz. Peterhansel, who has won six motorbike titles and three in a four-wheeler, is more than two hours behind Sainz in fourth place in the overall standings. ""Eighty kilometers after the start we caught up with Nasser,"" Sainz told the race's official Web site. ""We stayed behind him because he couldn't hear the Sentinel and we couldn't get past. ""It was quite a slow and winding route, mostly lanes. What I did first was to get close to Nasser, then I stayed around at 1:40. After that, from the 80km point onwards, we were driving in the dust."" Al-Attiyah, who won the ninth stage, said he struggled after having to lead out the field. ""It was very dangerous at that speed. There were a lot of corners, a lot of slippery stuff. For me it was not a good feeling and I'm really happy to have finished this stage without any problems,"" he said. ""Today it was very stressful because I opened the road. Tomorrow there will be some off-road and more dunes. It will be good for me."" Peterhansel's compatriot Cyril Despres leads the bike class by one hour, 22 minutes and 49 seconds despite finishing only sixth on Tuesday. Spain's Marc Coma, also riding a KTM machine, won the stage by more than two minutes from another Frenchman, David Fretigne, but is way back in 17th overall. Russia's Vladimir Chagin is more than an hour ahead in the truck class after following up his stage win on Monday with another victory. Wednesday's 11th stage sees the race move from Chile back into Argentina.","Carlos Sainz is closing on his first Dakar Rally car title after extending his lead with victory on Tuesday's 10th stage in the South American event.
