A reclusive multimillionaire was beaten to death by Polish builders in a vain attempt to get him to reveal where he kept his hoard of cash, the Old Bailey heard today. Property tycoon William John Saunderson-Smith, 58, who was known as John, was found in the attic bedroom of a house he was renovating in West Kensington, London, in October last year. He was allegedly bludgeoned to death by three Polish builders who later fled the country, jurors heard. Slawomir Bugajewski, 39, and Dawid Rymar, 24, both of Acton, west London, and Ireneusz Mydlarz, 37, of Edgware, north London, who had carried out renovation work for the tycoon just weeks earlier, deny murder. The court was told the three builders lay in wait until Mr Saunderson-Smith turned off the lights and went to bed, before forcing open a sash window and attacking him. His body was discovered by a young . assistant at one of his properties in Dewhurst Road on October 21 last year. Following the killing, Rymar and . Bugajewski took a coach from Victoria Coach Station in central London . back to their homeland - stopping off on the way for a three-day break . in Paris where they posed in front of the Eiffel Tower, the court heard. Mydlarz flew . directly back to Poland, but is said to have blown hundreds on designer . clothes and an iPad during a spending spree just hours after the . killing. One of the defendants later told police they took £2,000 . but officers later found they missed £225,000 hidden in and around the . bedroom, and a further £100,000 at another property in Fulham. Home: Mr Saunderson-Smith's body was discovered by a young . assistant at this property in Dewhurst Road, West Kensington on October 21 last year . Mr Saunderson-Smith owned a large portfolio of properties in London and abroad, many of which were let to visitors from Australia and New Zealand. He dealt mainly in cash, stashing vast sums around the houses he owned and preferred to use Polish builders for renovation work. Aftab Jafferjee QC, prosecuting, . said: 'Mr Saunderson-Smith, though reclusive and scruffy in appearance, . was no ordinary occupant of this west London house. 'He was in fact a very wealthy property developer who owned various addresses in the west London area. 'Mr Saunderson-Smith owned numerous properties, both here and abroad, and was a multimillionaire. 'He . had plainly retired to bed. He was obviously taken by surprise - the . range and extent of his injuries being far beyond anything required . merely to subdue him, which suggests a beating to get him to reveal . where his money was before he was finally finished off.' In court: Slawomir Bugajewski, 39, Dawid Rymar, 24, and Ireneusz Mydlarz, 37, all deny murdering property tycoon Mr Saunderson-Smith at the Old Bailey . Mr Jafferjee added: ‘It will be . apparent the victim had not given up his life cheaply as vast sums of . money - about £225,000 - were discovered by police secreted in and . around his bedroom and plainly undetected by his killers.’ The court heard Mr Saunderson-Smith had been obsessive about the possibility of being burgled since his stepfather was attacked years earlier. He often kept a . bayonet-type blade close to his bed as he slept, said Mr Jafferjee, . adding: ‘Sadly that was not available to him in the early hours of . October 21. ‘There is little or no evidence of him being able to fight back. He had plainly retired to bed and when his body was found he was only wearing a T-shirt. ‘He was plainly taken was surprise, . the range and extent of his injuries being far beyond anything required . merely to subdue him, which suggests a beating to get him to reveal . where his money was before he was finally finished off.’ The trial continues.

A teenager dumped by his girlfriend made her listen on the phone as a mother of three he had brutally attacked bled to death in his home. Reece Ludlow, 18, was jailed for life today for killing 35-year-old Louisa Brannan by beating her over the head with a frying pan and stabbing her 25 times with two knives. Ludlow picked up Ms Brannan at a pub and they had sex at his flat in Sutton, south London, before the brutal murder. Sick: Louisa Brannan, left, was murdered by Reece Ludlow, who phoned his ex-girlfriend while she lay dying on the floor of his home . He then attacked her before phoning his ex-girlfriend, who he said he had not got over, to tell her what he had done. A horrified Miss Pronsan could hear Ms Brannan, from Huddersfield, screaming 'I'm dying' in the background. Ludlow had admitted manslaughter but denied murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility. He was relying on two psychiatric . reports from doctors, but they withdrew their support and he admitted murder moments before he was to give evidence in . his defence. Woolwich Crown Court heard Miss Pronsan had dumped Ludlow because of his violent and aggressive behaviour. He told his ex-girlfriend he had attacked the woman he had picked up at the Kings Arms pub in Mitcham because she had called his mother a b***h. ‘Once they were back at the flat there was some kind of sexual contact between them,’ said Adrian Darbishire, prosecuting. 'Not long after that she was subjected to a brutal attack that led, after some hours, to her death in the flat.’ Miss Pronsan said Ludlow was ‘cold and evil’, after he phoned her and said: ‘Baby, I’ve done something really bad.’ - JUDGE NICHOLAS HILLIARD . He told her he had stabbed the victim, adding: ‘She’s in the kitchen and there’s blood everywhere.’ Mr Darbishire said: ‘Speaking from the flat, he began to describe what he had done. She could be heard crying for help, literally begging for her life. Nothing was done to help her.’ Ludlow later rang his ex-girlfriend again to tell Miss Pronsan she was dead. He told her: ‘Come and help me, you will make it better, just come and see me, I only want to be with you, that’s all I want.’ Ludlow then called his mother, who alerted the police. When officers arrived at the flat in the early hours of March 14 last year they were confronted by a bloodbath. The kitchen and bedroom doors were covered in blood and Miss Brannan’s naked body was discovered in the bathroom. A serrated knife and a frying pan covered in hair and blood were found in the kitchen, while another knife was found on the floor. After a five-day manhunt, Ludlow, now 20, was arrested on March 19, after he fell out of a train at Victoria Station and injured his head. Sentencing him to life imprisonment, with a 17-year minimum, Judge Nicholas Hilliard told Ludlow: 'Your victim Louisa Brannan has had her own difficulties in life. Her sister Kayleigh learned of her murder whilst herself dying of cancer. 'She was 35 years old when it was her misfortune to meet you.' Judge Hilliard said he was satisfied Ms Brannan had not abused or insulted Ludlow's family, as he had claimed, and that he had been an 'enthusiastic participant' in sexual activity with his victim before he killed her. 'I am satisfied that you became frustrated and angry when you did not receive the comfort from Miss Brannan that you sought,' he said, as more than a dozen members of the victim's family packed the public gallery. Ms Brannan’s eldest daughter suffered a stroke after hearing of her mother’s murder and was confined to a wheelchair for some time, but struggled on crutches to give a tribute at the funeral. Woolwich Crown Court, pictured, heard Fon Pronsan had dumped Ludlow because of his violent and aggressive behaviour . He said it was clear that Ludlow had not been able to cope after his break up with Miss Pronsan. 'Louisa Brannan paid a terrible price for those emotions of yours which, you chose on that night, not to limit or control. 'Your victim was naked, defenceless and in unfamiliar surroundings when you subjected her to a sustained and brutal attack. 'She did not, as you know, die straight away. Instead over several hours, about five, she was at your mercy in that flat, naked and dying. 'She must have been terrified and you showed her no mercy. 'Your response was not to seek proper help for her, but after a while telephone Miss Pronsan. 'She was heard to scream and ask for help and you were heard to abuse her and tell her to get up. 'You had several hours to show her one ounce of compassion and you chose not to. You are extremely dangerous when thwarted.' In a victim impact statement read to the court, her mother Anita Brannan said: 'Louisa was a kind, generous and loving person who always saw the best in everyone. 'She was friendly but also very fragile and vulnerable. She never gave up trying to be a better person and we all wanted so much to see her happy. 'Before her death it seemed she was finally in a good place.' She said that after her other daughter had been diagnosed with a terminal brain tumour, the family had gathered in good spirits to celebrate Kayleigh's wedding. - ANITA BRANNAN, MOTHER . 'It was shortly after this that Louisa was taken,' she added. 'The pain and suffering has ripped the family apart.' Ms Brannan had been living in Doncaster but had moved in with her father in Mitcham so she could support her sister through her illness. Kayleigh, 22, died of cancer in August last year, blaming herself for her sister being in the area the night she was murdered. 'Sometimes we try to shut it off, but it is always there in the background,' said Mrs Brannan. 'We will never understand why our family has been put through this and why she was taken from us. 'Every minute of every day we have to face the horrific, lonely and painful way in which Louisa faced her last hours. 'It will be with us for the rest of our lives. We miss her so much.' The judge told Ludlow: 'You had a number of hours to show her some compassion and you chose not to. You are extremely dangerous when thwarted.' Speaking after the sentence, Detective Inspector Dave Reid said: 'Reece Ludlow not only attacked Louisa Brannan in the most vicious and violent manner but he failed to call an ambulance and instead spent hours speaking on the telephone. 'He did not account for his actions during his police interviews and has never properly explainedwhy he inflicted such a fate on Ms Brannan. 'Ms Brannan's family has been left devastated by her death and I only hope that Ludlow's conviction will go in some small way to comfort them.'","Reece Ludlow was jailed for life for killing Louisa Brannan after picking her up at a pub .

"By . Emily Andrews . PUBLISHED: . 17:18 EST, 16 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:29 EST, 17 July 2012 . Fury: Chris Tarrant, pictured with girlfriend Jane Bird, has told of his anger at the breakin . Chris Tarrant has spoken of his anger after burglars targeted his mother’s house only days after she died. They took heirlooms including jewellery, silver cutlery and vases. They also stole bottles of wine, her television and even her coat. Tarrant was with Joan, 93, when she died at home in April. He had suspected thieves were watching her £400,000 detached home, which was on a quiet street in Reading, Berkshire. The burglars struck before Mrs Tarrant’s funeral and before the presenter was able to start the emotional task of clearing her home. The 65-year-old said: ‘They are b***ards. They knew very well it was an elderly lady who had died.’ Neighbour Paul Roberts, 64, said: ‘The burglary clearly upset Chris because I did speak to him when he came round to the house to sort out his mum’s possessions. ‘He was very upset. I just said to him it must have been particularly difficult since the house would have had a lot of memories for him too – he did live there for a few years too. ‘Joan was a lovely lady and she was a fighter till the very end. She was an amazing woman with a lot of strength. ‘It’s outrageous what those burglars did, especially since it was coming up to the funeral itself.’  The  Thames Valley Police spokesman said officers were called to the property nine days after Mrs  Tarrant’s death. They said the culprits had not yet been caught and police are appealing for information about the incident. Tarrant’s father, Basil, died seven years ago. Earlier this year the presenter, an only child, revealed how close he was to his parents in the Channel 5 show War Hero In My Family. He said: ‘My father was my best friend. We did everything together. ‘My mother was a kind soul who never told a lie in her life. Not one. I said that at her funeral. They were my heroes.’ Basil Tarrant was an infantry major in the Second World War and received the Military Cross for his bravery. Burgled: Thieves stole heirlooms from Joan Tarrant's Berkshire home . While researching the programme about his father’s life, Tarrant discovered he had killed German  soldiers during house-to-house fighting in a night patrol in Kleve, a border town between Germany and the Netherlands. ‘My jokey, lovely dad killing people with a bayonet or with his bare hands. ‘And then he came home and went back to the Huntley, Boorne &  Stevens biscuit tin factory and never spoke about it. Emotional: Chris Tarrant has spoken movingly about discovering his father was a war hero during research for a new television programme . ‘Finding that out blew my mind,’ Tarrant said. His discoveries also made him  re-evaluate his relationship with his four children – two from his first marriage and two with ex-wife Ingrid. He said: ‘I’m not a great dad because in the early years I worked too hard and didn’t see the kids enough. ‘After the break-up with Ingrid they weren’t fond of their father. But these days I know what counts. I keep promises. ‘The death of parents gives you perspective. Now I know my greatest achievements are my children. ‘There’s no gong, media success or a million-quid cheque that beats that.’ He said his relationship with Ingrid is not quite so successful. ‘We haven’t had a conversation for years. It’s a shame. I do hope it all sorts itself out one day.’ The marriage collapsed spectacularly in 2006 after Ingrid hired a private detective who discovered that Tarrant had been having a decade-long affair with primary school deputy head Fiona McKechnie. Now Tarrant lives a much quieter life with girlfriend Jane Bird, and says he has not been so happy for a long time. ‘She’s an Essex girl and a lovely lady. She’d come out and stay on my 40-acre place in the country in high heels and say: “What am I doing here?” ‘She didn’t like the country uniform – wellies and Barbour. Now she indulges my country ways. Especially fishing. ‘Would I marry her? No. The reason we are together is because we like each other. ‘She doesn’t want to either. It puts pressure on. She’s just a mate.’","Chris Tarrant suspected thieves were watching his mother £400,000 detached home, which was on a quiet street in Reading, Berkshire ."

The Simon Wiesenthal Centre, which compiles a list of the most-wanted suspects from the Second World War, confirmed that Laszlo Csatary was identified in the Hungarian capital, Budapest. The 97-year-old was a police commander in charge of a . Jewish ghetto in Kassa, Hungary, during the war, from where thousands were sent to their deaths at Auschwitz. Activists protest against Csatary after a Hungarian prosecutor said that investigating an aged Nazi war criminal found alive and well in Budapest was problematic because the events took place so long ago and in a different country . The door of Laszlo Csatary's hideaway building . in Budapest, on which activists have pasted 'No Nazi' symbols and a . slogan prior to their protest against Csatary. Right, Dr Efraim Zuroff, . director of the Wiesenthal Centre in Jerusalem, who has submitted fresh . evidence to the Budapest prosecutor's office . Ten months ago an informer, who was . paid $25,000 for the tip-off, had provided information that allowed the . Simon Wiesenthal Centre to . locate Csatary, 97, in Budapest. In September last year, they had passed on their information to the . prosecutor's office in the Hungarian capital. A statement released on Sunday by Efraim Zuroff, the . director of the centre dedicated to hunting down Nazi-war criminals, . said it had submitted new evidence regarding crimes committed . during World War II by its 'Number One Most Wanted suspect' Laszlo . Csatary. The centre said the evidence related to Csatary's key role in the . deportation of approximately 300 Jews from Kosice . to Kamenetz-Podolsk, Ukraine, where almost all were murdered in the summer of . 1941. Activists and sympathisers of the European Union of Jewish Students stand with their hands taped to each other's in front of Laszlo Csatary's hideaway building .

Budapest's assistant prosecutor general, Jeno Varga, said: 'An . investigation is under way. The prosecutor's office will study the information . received.' But Zuroff said in the Centre's statement: 'This new evidence . strengthens the already very strong case against Csatary and reinforces our . insistence that he be held accountable for his crimes. 'The passage of time in no way diminishes his guilt and old age should . not afford protection for Holocaust perpetrators.' Zuroff told AFP that the The Sun had photographed and filmed Csatary, having . acted on the information that the Wiesenthal Centre had released last . September. When its reporters confronted him on his doorstep, he had denied any crimes . and slammed the door in their faces, the paper reported. Participants of a demonstration called by the European Union of Jewish Students protested in front of Laszlo Csatary's hideaway building in Budapest today. The demonstration was called after a Hungarian prosecutor said that investigating an aged Nazi war criminal found alive and well in Budapest was problematic because the events took place so long ago and in a different country. The Wiesenthal Centre has urged Hungarian . prosecutors to put Csatary on trial. They say he served during World War II as a senior Hungarian police officer . in the Slovakian city of Kosice, then under Hungarian rule. Hell: Millions lost their lives at Auschwitz Concentration Camp, where Laszlo Csatary is accused of being complicit in deporting 15,700 to their deaths . Csatary, the former police commander of the Jewish ghetto in Kassa, Hungary, is accused of complicity in transporting thousands to their deaths . He was complicit in the deportations of thousands of Jews from Kosice and the surrounding area to the Auschwitz death camp in the spring of 1944. According to evidence, Csatary had treated the Jews in the ghetto with cruelty, whipping women and . forcing them to dig holes with their bare hands. In 1948, a Czech court condemned him to death after a trial held in his . absence. He had fled to Canada and had worked as an art dealer using a false . identity, before being unmasked in 1995 and forced to flee. Laszlo Csatary, who the Simon Wiesenthal Centre says has been found in Hungary, is number one on the group's list of Nazi war criminals known to be still alive and at large almost seven decades after World War II. Csatary, who is now 97, is listed by the Vienna-based Nazi-hunters as having 'helped organise the deportation to Auschwitz of approximately 15,700 Jews' from Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia in early 1944. The top two names - Alois Brunner and Aribert Heim - are widely suspected to be dead.The following are the five top remaining names on the Simon Wiesenthal Centre's list: . 1: Laszlo CsataryServed as a Hungarian police chief in Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia. Accused of being instrumental in sending thousands to death camps. 2: Gerhard SommerA former German SS officer who was involved in the massacre of 560 civilians in August, 1944 in Italy. 3: Vladimir Katriuk Served in a Ukrainian battalion which murdered Jews and other civilians in Belarus during the war. 4: Karoly ZentaiTook part in the persecution and murder of Jews in Budapest in 1944. 5: Soeren KamAn officer in an SS division during the war, he took part in the murder of an anti-Nazi newspaper publisher in Denmark.","Former police commander, 97, is one of the most-wanted suspects of Nazi war crimes .

Seven people, including two men in their seventies, are being treated in hospital after an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease. The patients - six men and a women - were being treated at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire, in Stoke-on-Trent, the Health Protection Agency (HPA) said . A spokesman for the HPA said age of the patients varied from late 40s to 75 years old. Outbreak: The patients were being treated for legionnaires' disease at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire . 'Two men in their seventies remain stable, the remaining patients are improving,' the spokesman added. 'The HPA is also investigating two cases identified in early summer as being possibly linked to the current cluster.' Professor Harsh Duggal, director of the Health Protection Unit in Stafford, said an investigation was being carried out to try to identify the source of the outbreak. He said: 'While we do not currently have a direct link between the cases the evidence points to the fact that there is a common source. 'We are taking detailed histories of the movements of the patients to see if there are similar patterns which would indicate a local source of infection. 'Legionnaires’ disease is a rare but potentially life-threatening illness. 'It is caused by a bacteria commonly associated with water systems and cannot be passed from person to person. 'As a precaution we are working with the Health and Safety Executive and Stoke-on-Trent City Council Environmental Health Services to identify and control any possible sources of the disease.' Public and environmental health experts from the HPA, the Health and Safety Executive, the NHS in Stoke and Stoke-on-Trent City Council are jointly investigating the seven confirmed cases. The HPA said action taken so far includes identifying, sampling and advising on the disinfection of potential sources of the disease, such as cooling towers, in areas that those being treated may have visited in common. Health care staff in the areas where the patients live, including GPs, have been alerted to the outbreak and to look out for patients who may be developing symptoms of the disease. Deadly: A close-up photograph of Legionella pneumophila, the bacteria known to cause Legionnaires' disease . People have also been made aware of the symptoms of Legionnaires’ disease, the HPA added. The outbreak in Stoke-on-Trent is the second in the UK in as many months. An outbreak in Edinburgh came to light at the end of May and is thought to have centred on a cluster of cooling towers in the south-west of the city. Three people died after contracting the illness and last week the total number of confirmed and suspected cases stood at 101. The outbreak in Scotland has since been declared over by health officials. Early symptoms of Legionnaires’ disease, which cannot be spread from person to person, include a flu-like illness with muscle aches, tiredness, headaches, dry cough and fever which can then lead to pneumonia, the HPA said. Killer: Three people died after an outbreak of the disease was confirmed in Edinburgh at the end of May . It is caused by a germ called Legionella pneumophila. As with any pneumonia, the patient can become very unwell. Diarrhoea and/or confusion may occur, as well as chest and breathing symptoms.It is effectively treated with a course of antibiotics. Although this bacteria is widely distributed in the environment it can lead to human illness if sources such as wet air conditioning systems are not well maintained. People are advised if they are feeling unwell with any of the possible signs to go and see their doctor, ring NHS Direct on 0845 4647 or visit www.nhs.uk . The HPA stressed that there is no need for anyone who is well or only mildly unwell to see their doctor or to have any tests.","Patients aged between late 40s and 75, Health Protection Agency confirms .

Workers at a train company expected to ferry thousands of spectators to Olympic sailing events are to take industrial action during the Games in a row over pay. The announcement from South West trains comes just days after the company's director urged spectators travelling to sailing events in Weymouth not to use their services and go by car instead. Up to 1,000 train drivers and other staff at South West Trains will now work to rule and have backed a ban on overtime starting on Friday. Thousands of sailing fans are expected to descend on historic Weymouth in Dorset, pictured . The industrial action - which is due to end on August 12, the last day of the Olympics - is expected to cause travel chaos as thousands of visitors flock to the Dorset coast. Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport Union rejected the option of an outright strike but voted instead for different forms of action which may lead to significant disruption. The managing director of the company Tim Shoveller said he was upset by the planned industrial action. 'It is disappointing the RMT seems . intent on trying to disrupt services at such an important time for our . customers and the country,' he said. 'Their attempts to renege on the deal . they agreed have gone down badly with the public and RMT members also . voted against strike action over this issue. 'Despite . the RMT action announced today, we can confirm we will be running a . full service for our passengers during the Games so they can get to and . from the London 2012 events. Up to 1,000 railway staff at South West Trains will now work to rule and have backed a ban on overtime to coincide with the start of the Games . Fans going to Weymouth to cheer on three-times Gold medalist Ben Ainslie, pictured, are being warned to drive and not rely on the train network . 'We’re pleased that most of our employees have voted against taking a strike during the Games. 'This means we can deliver our full Olympic train service and ensure our passengers can enjoy the excitement of London 2012, a once in a lifetime experience. 'As we have said all along, the RMT agreed to a generous pay deal some months ago, which covered the period of the London 2012 Games' But Mr Shoveller earlier warned power supply issues would mean that the company would be operating diesel services. 'Because of the power supply problem...the park-and-ride is the primary way people are being advised to get to Weymouth for the sailing,' he told the BBC. RMT general secretary Bob Crow, said: 'Although we have secured good deals on Olympics recognition and reward for the vast majority of our members, we still have a small number of employers holding out and refusing to offer a fair deal. 'We cannot accept that blatant . unfairness and the time has come for these employers to seize the . opportunity, get round the table and sign off agreements that recognise . the additional work and pressures that these staff will be carrying.' Up . to 80,000 extra passengers every day are expected to use the South West . train network during the Olympics, as gold medal hopefuls including . three-times Olympic winner Ben Ainslie take part in the sailing . competitions in Weymouth. Thousands of spectators are expected to flock to Weymouth on the Dorset coast to watch Olympic sailing events . There were severe delays today on one of the key Tube lines that will ferry people to the Olympics. The problem was at North Greenwich close to the Olympic site at Stratford. It meant long hold ups on the Jubilee line in the early part of the morning rush hour. The delays also affected passengers on the London Overground - another key Olympic route. Drivers coming into London today also experienced delays of up to 90 minutes. A lane restriction on the A40 at Hanger Lane in west London caused backlogs on the M40. The lane alterations are part of the preparation for the full introduction on Wednesday of the Olympic traffic-only Games Lanes in London. The 30 miles of lanes are part of the 109-mile Olympic Route Network designed to allow athletes and officials to travel around the capital. Despite Mr Shoveller's assurances, however, meltdown could occur if a larger number of spectators than anticipated decide to travel by public transport to the south west. Almost £100m has gone towards improving roads in the area close to Weymouth, but the railway network - which for part of the route still has a single track - has received no new investment. As well as contending with difficulties getting to the pretty seaside town, spectators may also struggle to put their feet up when they do arrive in Weymouth - due to a ban on folding chairs. Weymouth's Nothe Gardens are an ideal vantage point to see the sailing out in the bay and has a steep bank where spectators will sit, but officials have banned chairs there because of safety fears. A London 2012 spokesman said: 'For health and safety reasons fold-up chairs are not permitted in the Nothe Gardens which is an exposed and steeply banked site. 'We were clear about the site specifications at the point of sale, however, we will have limited fixed seating available for those that most require it.'","The industrial action - timed to last for the entire duration of the Olympic Games - will mean train workers will do the bare minimum work .

Brandi Jo Roman, 28, abandoned the three-year-old girl and crying five-year-old boy while she headed into a club in Tampa, Florida. Officers  from the Tampa Police Department found her inebriated and sitting beside the stage of the Mons Venus strip club with cash in her hand. Neglect: Brandi Jo Roman abandoned her children in a car that stank of alcohol while she went into a strip club . The children were sat in the Ford F-150 pick-up truck, which reeked of alcohol, with a can of a malt liquor called Four Loko in easy reach, according the New York Daily News. Roman, whose speech was slurred, now faces two charges of child neglect and her offspring have been taken into care by the Florida Department of Children and Families. 'When the officers asked her to stand up she was unstable,' said police spokesperson Janelle McGregor. 'They could smell the alcohol emitting from her mouth.' Irresponsible: Roman, 28, was found sitting drunkenly by the stage at Mons Venus strip club in Florida . When questioned, she told officers she had left her children in the car so they could watch a film. Both children had scratches, according to the Tampa Bay Times. Club owner Joe Redner said Roman had asked the cover charge and then returned to her vehicle to collect more money to pay the $20. 'She paid some of it in quarters,' he said. 'My manager saw how inebriated she was and we didn't want her to go back to the car and drive away with those kids in that state.'

A 77-year-old gardener and his 68-year-old partner have become Britain’s oldest couple to be fitted with electronic tags. Ian Bartlett and Rosemary Collier were fitted with the tracking devices after they pleaded guilty to stealing thousands of pounds from a vulnerable pensioner. Their victim, Patricia Hardy, hired Bartlett to work in her garden in Whitstable, Kent, in 2007 as she  was recovering from a stroke, Canterbury Crown Court heard, and was introduced to Collier soon afterwards. 'Despicable': Ian Bartlett and his partner Rosemary Collier have become Britain's oldest couple to be tagged after they stole thousands of pounds from a stroke victim as she lay in hospital . Within a year Bartlett was so trusted . by Mrs Hardy, who was in her early 80s, that he was handed  her . chequebook and bank card to pay bills for her. When Mrs Hardy was hospitalised in . 2010, Bartlett and Collier withdrew £2,100 from her bank account over a . two-month period. They also contacted her lawyers in a bid to get her . car, a Toyota Yaris worth £3,000, signed over to them. When this failed, . the pair, who have a combined age of 145, simply took it anyway. In restraints: The couple must wear the tags on their legs as part of a four-month curfew . But suspicions were raised when  a . nurse spotted them rifling through Mrs Hardy’s bag and locker at  the . hospital, the court heard  last week. When police searched the couple’s home . they found a puzzle book filled with attempts to forge Mrs Hardy’s . signature, which Collier tried to ‘snatch’ off a police officer when he . picked it up. Andrew Walklate, prosecuting, said . detectives initially investigated what had happened to £17,000 of the . victim’s cash but the case was allowed to proceed when they admitted . stealing £2,100 in April and May 2010, as well as the car. He added that prior to her death last . year at the age of 85, Mrs Hardy expressed anger that the couple were . banned from visiting her as she regarded them as ‘good friends’. Oliver Kirk, defending, admitted: ‘This was the exploitation of a vulnerable person who had been a trusted friend.’ Judge Michael O’Sullivan told  the . pair: ‘You should be ashamed of what you did. This lady trusted you . implicitly. You plundered her account. Your behaviour can only be . described as despicable.’ The couple, who have three children, . five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren, were jailed for ten . months each, suspended for a year, and ordered to repay £2,100 to Mrs . Hardy’s estate. Can't go out: The curfew prevents the pensioners from leaving their house (not pictured) in Tankerton (above), Kent, between 7pm and 7am . They were also given electronic tags . to enforce a four-month curfew preventing them from leaving their home . in Tankerton, Kent, between 7pm and 7am.

She was our . friend and we were helping her out because she had no one else to. ‘Any money that we took from her we . used to buy her shopping and pay bills – we didn’t keep any of it and we . always told her what we were using the money for.’ She said the signatures in the puzzle . book had been Mrs Hardy trying to practise following her stroke and . added: ‘I used to go swimming, but now I don’t want to go to the pool . because I’m embarrassed about the tag.

Sleeping pills: Last week Kerry Kennedy blamed a July 11 car accident on a seizure but now blood tests show she was on the sleeping pill, Ambien . Speaking outside court last week Kerry Kennedy said tests showed she was on no drugs when she smashed her Lexus into a truck and blamed the crash on a ‘partial seizure.’ However, blood tests released today show that RFK's daughter was under the influence of the sleeping drug Ambien on the day of the accident, contradicting her own doctor’s findings. Prosecutors submitted the report as evidence against 52-year-old Kennedy who pleaded not guilty on July 17 to driving under the influence of drugs. The blood test, filed in North Castle Town Court, showed that a toxicologist detected 14 nanograms per milliliter of zolpidem, the sleep aid found in Ambien, in a sample taken on July 11, the day Kennedy's Lexus swerved across Interstate 684 and swiped a tractor-trailer. Responding officers found her slumped over the wheel  of the white 2008 Lexus RS 350 . After the crash, she told the officers that she had possibly mixed up two prescription drugs before getting behind the wheel and taken the sleeping pill Ambien instead of a daily prescription that she takes for a thyroid problem. She then said outside court on the 17th that she was ‘confused and erratic’ while talking to police. The amount of zolpidem found in her system is low, typical of someone who would have just taken a pill or taken one several hours before, said Dr. Michael Thorpy, director of the sleep disorder center at Montefiore Medical Center in New York. A urine sample was negative for alcohol, the toxicologist wrote. Speaking outside court last week Kennedy said: 'The accident was not caused by a sleeping aid but by a complex partial seizure. My doctor says this is the first seizure I have ever had.' In a statement issued late Wednesday Kennedy, the ex-wife of Governor Andrew Cuomo said: 'It now appears that my first instinct was correct.' She said she had sought other explanations for the accident when the first drug tests came back negative. Scroll down for video . Family affair: Kerry Kennedy, centre, is flanked by her sister Rory, left and brother Chris right, as she arrived at court on July 17. The Kennedy family have been accused of behaving like an 'organised crime' clan following her arrest . Outraged: The accident and ensuing criticism has led Caroline Kennedy, Kerry's cousin and the daughter of John F.Kennedy, to decry that the family are at their 'lowest point ever,' according to insiders . Police said Kennedy failed several sobriety tests and was swaying and slurring her speech. After . the crash, the Kennedy family ordered their own ‘battery’ of tests to . prove that Kerry was not under the influence of any drugs or alcohol. The move led a law enforcement source to slam the family as behaving like ‘some organized-crime family’ reported Radar.  'They come out playing hardball with bare knuckles,' the source fumed. The . accident and ensuing criticism has led Caroline Kennedy, Kerry’s cousin . and the daughter of John F.Kennedy, to decry that the family are at . their ‘lowest point ever,' according to insiders. An . insider told the National Enquirer that 54-year-old Caroline Kennedy is . furious with her family and is desperate to save their name for future . generations. ‘She read Kerry the riot act and is calling the family together to lecture them on cleaning up their act,’ the insider said. Caroline is reportedly ‘hopping mad’ at her family being likened to a crime family, the insider said. Kerry Kennedy pleaded not guilty July 17 . to a charge of driving while drug-impaired. She was released but was . ordered to undergo evaluation by a substance abuse agency. She is due . back in court Aug. 14, where her lawyers may argue the 'Ambien defense.' The 'Ambien defense' is a relatively . new strategy that has been successfully used to clear drivers who had . taken the medication before being arrested for operating a vehicle while . intoxicated. Doctors . have recorded rare cases of the drug causing people to eat, walk and . even get behind the wheel of a car while under the effects of the . popular sedative. In those cases, the patients claimed to have no memory . of their actions. As a result, courts have found they are not . criminally liable for their actions. However, . most successful uses of the defense argument have come in cases where . the defendants were found during normal sleeping times and often when . they were discovered wearing pajamas. Ambien: Ms Kennedy said she was 'confused and erratic' when she told officers she may have taken the sleeping pill Ambien, which has been known in rare cases to cause 'sleep-driving'. But on Wednesday she said her 'first instinct' appears to be right after tests showed it WAS in her system the day of the crash . Arrested: Kerry Kennedy has been charged with driving while impaired with drugs in New York . The driver of the truck Kerry Kennedy . crashed into on July 13 spoke about the accident and recalled how RFK's . daughter's was driving erratically for more than three miles on the . Westchester highway before the Lexus slammed into his rig and careered . off the interstate. He told . the New York Post: 'My first impression was that she was really, really . drunk. She's very lucky she didn't kill somebody.' He . told the Post that right before the crash, he saw Kennedy's head drop . down to the steering wheel before snapping up again and nodding off . again, all while veering in and out of lanes. 'When she hit me, my left tire tore up . her passenger-side door. She woke up a little bit, not a lot — not the way you’d wake up if you’d just hit a 6,000-pound truck.' One of the tires on her car came free and shot into oncoming traffic and smoke was pouring out of the Lexus, the truck driver said. Mr Scuitello told the Post he first thought she must be 'really, really . drunk' and recalled when he saw her she looked like she had just rolled . out of bed. Political marriage: Ms Kennedy is the ex-wife of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, left . Family: Kerry with her brother, Robert F. Kennedy Jr, and his (now deceased) wife Mary at a gala event in 2006 . Ms Kennedy, one of the most prominent members of the legendary Kennedy family, is the daughter of Robert F.

George Osborne infuriated Liberal Democrat colleagues and environmental groups yesterday by refusing to sign up to carbon emissions targets and insisting on a new ‘dash for gas’. The Chancellor is understood to be determined not to commit Britain to tough climate targets beyond 2020, arguing they will be a disadvantage for businesses. The Energy Department resisted calls for deep cuts to onshore wind subsidies, announcing yesterday a reduction of 10 per cent in payments for new turbines. Power: Government subsidies for wind turbines are to be cut by 10 per cent as George Osborne refuses to sign up for new carbon emissions targets . But green groups reacted angrily as . the Government’s energy strategy endorsed support for future gas power . in a compromise between the Lib Dem-led department and Mr Osborne. Significantly, sources said the Chancellor and Prime Minister were determined to block ‘decarbonisation’ targets after 2020. One Whitehall source said: ‘The . official line is the Government is reserving its position, but George . Osborne and David Cameron have made clear they object to post-2020 . targets, which suggests the Government will never agree to any.’ Ministers . also announced yesterday that Government subsidies for wind turbines . are to be cut by ten per cent and planning rules that regulate their . construction reviewed. The Chancellor had been pushing for even steeper cuts - but agreed to accept Liberal Democrat Energy Secretary Ed Davey’s proposal for an initial ten per cent reduction, followed by a further review next year. Resolute: Mr Osborne is understood to be determined not to commit Britain to tough new climate targets beyond 2020 . In exchange, the Lib Dems have agreed . that gas-fired power stations will be a key part of Britain’s energy . production well into the 2030s, despite the objections of climate change . campaigners. The . Government will commit to introducing a ‘simple and stable regulatory . regime’ to allow domestic shale gas development, using the controversial . process of ‘fracking’. Gas . deposits trapped underground are extracted by fracturing shale rock . with blasts of water, sand and chemicals -  a process that has been . accused of causing small earthquakes near sites. But it is the Chancellor’s determination to block new climate targets beyond 2020 that will cause most controversy. A report from MPs today insists Britain and the rest of Europe should sign up to even stricter emissions targets to boost green energy. They recommend the EU cuts carbon emissions by 30 per cent by 2020 - instead of the current 20 per cent which they claim is ‘not ambitious or challenging’. The Energy and Climate Change Committee says that despite opposition from the US and China to legally-binding caps on emissions, Europe should ‘show leadership’ on climate change. The MPs’ report claims increasing carbon targets would put pressure on the world’s biggest emitters to make similar commitments. At a UN climate conference in South Africa last December, world leaders agreed a ‘road map’ for all major countries - including developing countries - to introduce targets to tackle global warming for the first time. However the US, China and India - which make up around half of global emissions - will only have to start cutting them from 2020 and it is unclear how stringent or binding the targets will be. Tim Yeo, the Conservative MP who chairs the Energy and Climate Change Committee said: ‘Europe can be proud of the leadership it has shown on climate change. It must now show that leadership again by setting a more ambitious goal to bolster the chances of a new agreement being reached in 2015. ‘That needs to be the year an agreement is reached to give the world a fighting chance of keeping temperatures below dangerous levels. 'The EU’s current 20 per cent carbon reduction target by 2020 is no longer sufficiently ambitious or challenging and will easily be reached because of the recession.’ Supply and demand: Ministers have agreed that gas-fired power stations will be a key part of Britain's energy production well into the 2030s . The committee suggests Britain should . commit to around 42 per cent cuts in emissions on 1990 levels, through a . new generation of wind turbines, solar panels and nuclear power. But . manufacturers’ groups warned that high energy costs due to climate . policies were already putting thousands of industrial jobs at risk. The . Energy Intensive Users Group, representing around 800,000 people in . industries such as steel, cement and chemicals, is calling for tax . relief on energy costs for its members to avoid job losses. Its . chairman Steve Elliott said: ‘We all want to see a greener societ, but . we can’t do this with one hand tied behind our backs.’ John Sauven, executive director of . Greenpeace, said: ‘The Coalition has sunk to pretty low depths now it . has turned real UK opportunities for green growth and jobs into an . unedifying inter-department squabble.’","Chancellor determined not to to commit Britain to climate targets beyond 2020 .

Many of the buildings - including a train depot, bank, old . grit mill, restaurant and a 500-seat opera house - are more than 100 . years old and have been painstakingly restored. Its hotel is rumoured to have once sheltered General Sherman, who became famous - or notorious - for his 'modernising' policies during the American Civil War. Bristling homeowners, however, have . pointed out that several places in Toomsboro are not on sale, including the . convenience store, post office and flower shop. 'It's not the entire town,' said Clarice Harrison. 'I live up the hill and it's definitely not for sale.' The community has a population of just 700, many of whom have lived there for their whole lives and can remember the place when it was lively and bustling. After the school shut down in the late . 1950s, the main employer left and took the bank and businesses with it, . leaving the place more isolated. Mayor Roger Smith said: 'The town of Toomsboro has great potential - but it's a little blink-of-the-eye village at the moment. Who will buy? The Farmers Cotton Warehouse is just one of the historic buildings now on offer to the highest bidder . Desertion: It was when the old bank, pictured, closed and businesses moved out of Toomsboro that the community fell on hard times . Peaceful locale: Mr Lucado Jr relaxes in the town's quiet, simple barbershop . David Bumgardner purchased over 50 acres of Toomsboro from preservationist Bill Lucado and through an auction about a decade ago. His intention was to turn it into a quaint tourist town. But his plans changed. Now Bumgardner and Lucado are putting the town up for sale again. Lucado thinks it would be a perfect fit for a movie production company seeking a set or a music company looking for a great venue. 'With just the little rustic community, we could have some antique shops here and draw people in.' Developer David Bumgardner is open to offers, but with such a hefty price tag, he is . marketing mainly to film and music studios. The idea has a precedent. Actress Kim Bassinger bought the town of Braselton, Atlanta, USA in 1989 for $20m (£13m) - reportedly selling it five years later for only $1m. But Bill Lucado, the previous owner of the Toomsboro properties and broker for the sale, said this is different. 'There are still very few places where you can find this many original buildings in such good condition,' he said. 'Plus, Toomsboro comes with a sense of . community you simply can't buy - I really do hope something good will . come of it, I really do.' The developer is working on creating a website to provide more information on the properties. Expensive taste: Mr Lucado Jr. and Ms Gadd look over Toomsboro. Will it be bought by a film star, just as actress Kim Basinger bought the town of Braselton, Atlanta, for $20m in 1989? Everything must go: Coat hangers rust inside the Syrup Mill.

A thieving postman is facing jail for hoarding nearly 75,000 letters and parcels in his shed because he was 'too lazy' to deliver them. John Hodson, 33, who had debts of £50,000, targeted envelopes with gift cards and stole the contents. The father-of-two was caught out after a Royal Mail investigation planted two parcels with tracking devices. One of the parcels contained a £30 voucher, which Hodson was seen spending on tracksuit bottoms by a shop CCTV camera. He admitted theft and intentionally delaying the mail between November 2006 and April this year, and will be sentenced by Manchester magistrates next month. Royal Mail launched its surveillance operation in March after complaints of 58 greetings cards going missing in the Prestwich area. Hodson, who had been a postman for eight years, was rumbled by the tracking devices which showed the postal service's two planted parcels were in his car. Prosecutor Elizabeth Rigby told the court how Hodson was found to have £140 stolen from packages when he was apprehended. His car also contained an empty gift card wallet, other gift card packets and a 20 dollar bill. A search of his house found the tracksuit bottoms he had bought with the planted voucher, as well as 65 DVDs and 269 greetings-type packages. Investigators found junk mail in bundles and boxes with more stolen items in the kitchen bin. The guilty postman hoarded the packages so as to not draw attention to himself. Royal Mail investigators found this enormous stash of letters and junk mail at Hodson's home in Crumpsall . He said his behaviour was 'despicable' and that he had stolen the cash to repay debts. Mrs Rigby said: 'He estimated he had had between £400-600 but later said he didn’t know how much he had taken.' Michael Cahill, defending, said Hodson, of Chudleigh Road, Crumpsall, Greater Manchester, had never previously been in trouble. He had got into ‘an enormous amount of debt’ exceeding £50,000 with credit cards and loans. Mr Cahill said: 'He was living beyond his means and everything spiralled out of control.'","Jail on the cards for John Hodson, 33, who had debts of £50,000 .

Her Majesty's Secret Service: Bond and the Queen (aka Mark Sutton and Gary Connery) drop into the stadium . Gary and James Bond double Mark Sutton, 41, underwent months of secret training for their show-stealing jump. On the night, Gary, 43, was sewn into a copy of the salmon dress the . Queen was wearing, and the duo were driven to Stapleford airfield, . Essex. It was the first time he wore his . costume. 'I mean I’ve worn my own dresses out loads of times,' he joked. 'But in terms of the jump it was the first time.' Asked why he was chosen for the jump Mr Connery replied: 'Good question. I think they liked my legs.' He added: 'I’ve got Queen-style legs.' Their helicopter was given the all-clear to take off at 8.50pm by . military air-traffic controllers and then guided into position over the . arena at 800ft for the pair to make their entrance. After deploying their parachutes at 500ft, the duo steered away from the stadium and landed on a nearby bridge. Gary, who completed the world’s first skydive without a parachute in May, now says he has only one regret from the night: ‘I really wanted to . keep the dress, but I wasn’t allowed. It would have looked great on a . night out.’ The result was the most talked-about . sequence of Danny Boyle’s stunning Olympics Opening Ceremony.

It was the Queen’s first film role, but it was revealed that she needed only one take. ‘She’s a good actor,’ said Mr Boyle. ‘She’s very sharp. You didn’t have to tell her anything . twice.’ Not only that, he added, but she also ‘got along with James Bond . very well’. It was all the irrepressible Mr Boyle’s idea.

The helicopter hovered over the Olympic Stadium, before the Queen jumped out, pulling the rip cord on a Union Flag parachute . If Lord Coe was a little doubtful, . however, that it would be well received by the Queen’s courtiers, he was . quickly reassured. They listened sagely, laughed, and promised to ask . the Boss. The Mail on Sunday discovered that . it was her deputy private secretary, Edward Young, a former adviser to . William Hague, who acted as the go-between. Some insiders refer to him as the . ‘Secret Agent’ – because he was  the key link between the Palace and Mr . Boyle’s team. Lord Coe had served as chief of staff to William Hague . around the time Mr Young was working as the then Opposition leader’s . communications chief. Palace insiders felt it was a . fortuitous connection that at least gave Lord Coe a chance of winning . approval for the plan. The idea appealed to Mr Young, 45, who went to .

Mr Young, who is married, moved to Granada TV as . communications director in 2001 before taking up his role at Buckingham . Palace in 2007. Sources said Her Majesty’s only . stipulation for her acting role was that she would choose what to wear. Eschewing the bikini favoured by some who have gone before her – most . memorably Ursula Andress and Halle Berry – she decided on a salmon . dress.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 15:18 EST, 31 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 18:22 EST, 31 July 2012 . Accused: Drew Peterson, 57, pictured in 2009, has been imprisoned for the past three years awaiting trial for the death of his third wife, Kathleen Savio . Drew Peterson's murder trial finally started today - with two very conflicting stories. Prosecutors gave jurors an account that could have come from a 1940s pulp novel, in which a man does whatever he must — including murder — to keep his ex-wife's hands off his money. On the other side, Peterson's attorneys argued the former cop was a victim of something newer - a 24-hour news cycle and cable TV's talking heads, which together created a media frenzy that did not subside until prosecutors had charged an innocent man. Peterson is charged with first-degree murder in the 2004 death of his third wife, Kathleen Savio. He is suspected but not charged in the 2007 disappearance of his fourth wife, Stacy Peterson. Will County State's Attorney James Glasgow told jurors that Peterson, 58, killed Savio, 40, and made it look like an accident. 'Just weeks before her death, he told her he was going to kill her and she would not make it to a divorce settlement and would never get his pension,' Glasgow said during opening statements. Peterson's real-life drama inspired a TV movie and a national spotlight was put on the case, as many speculated whether Peterson used his law-enforcement expertise to get away with Savio's murder and make 23-year-old Stacy Peterson vanish. In his opening statement, Peterson's defense attorney, Joel Brodsky, tried to knock down what will certainly be the prosecutors' contention - that the investigation into Savio's death was a shoddy one. Brodsky told jurors that the Illinois State Police investigators were very experienced, and that the reason the state police conducted the investigation was because the Bolingbrook Police Department wanted to make sure there were no questions since Peterson was one of their officers. Brodksy even said state police 'bagged' Savio's hand to preserve any evidence. Brodsky said not one person — from police to prosecutors to Savio's own family— suggested Savio's death was anything other than an accident. Grave charges: Peterson is accused of murdering Kathleen Savio, left.  It was initially thought that she had drowned accidentally in the bathtub, right, but after her body was exhumed her death was ruled as a homicide . 'And the reason was because it was an accident,' he said, adding that there was no sign of a struggle. 'The bathroom was in perfect order,' he said. 'There is not one shred of evidence whatsoever that Drew . Peterson or anybody else for that matter was in that house. Why? Because . this was a household accident, that's why. 'Kathy slipped and fell in a household accident, case closed,' Brodsky said. Brodsky also suggested that Peterson . was the victim of a 'media circus' after Stacy Peterson disappeared, . triggered by the realization that Savio had died. Peterson was charged . in Savio's death after his much younger fourth wife vanished. Glasgow brought up Stacy Peterson . during the prosecution's opening statements, making it clear her . disappearance was the key to opening an investigation into Savio's . death. Peterson has denied wrongdoing in both cases. Glasgow also told the jury what has . been widely known for years but what Glasgow has not said explicitly - . There is no physical evidence linking Peterson to Savio's death. A botched initial investigation into . Savio's death leaves prosecutors with scant physical evidence. They'll . be forced to rely heavily on hearsay evidence — statements not heard . directly by a witnesses — which is normally barred at trials, as well as . circumstantial evidence to convince jurors of Peterson's guilt. The first witness called today Savio's close friend and next-door neighbor Mary Pontarelli. She . cried as she was shown a picture of Savio lying lifeless in her bathtub . before describing the moment she found her body in March 2004. Mrs Pontarelli . told the court she and her husband Tom, their son Nick and another . neighbor, Steve Carcerano, entered the home late in the evening after . Drew told her he could not get in touch with his ex-wife. Earlier days: Former Bolingbrook police sergeant Drew Peterson talks to the media as he leaves his home in Bolingbrook, Illinois in 2007 . In memoriam: Flowers and a small angel statue surround the grave marker of Kathleen Savio, the third wife of Peterson, at the Queen of Heaven Cemetery in Hillside, Illinois . She recalled: 'I went into the . bathroom, seen Kathleen in the tub and I ran out of the bathroom and . threw myself on the floor and started screaming. ' Peterson checked Savio's pulse and when she asked if she was dead he replied: 'Yes Mary, she is.' She said she noticed dried blood in . Savio's hair and blood coming from her mouth, and she had bruises on her . wrists and buttocks. Mrs Pontarelli said she offered to . cover Savio with a towel 'because I didn't want people to see her like . that. But he (Peterson) said we weren't supposed to touch anything and . we couldn't do that.' The prosecution is expected to try . and use statements that Stacy Peterson made to her minister before she . vanished in which she said that her husband had admitted to killing . Savio. While hearsay is usually barred, if . the judge admits Stacy Peterson’s statements, the testimony could be . damaging to Peterson, according to Kathleen Zellner, a Chicago attorney . who has been following the case. Distress: Marcia and Henry Savio, parents of Drew Peterson's third wife Kathleen, return to court as he stands trial for her murder . ‘What . the judge is going to do is he's going to wait and make individual . rulings each time the prosecution tries to introduce hearsay, not give a . blanket ruling, but listen to see if they open the door in some way . that makes the hearsay admissible. He'll make this a day by day ruling . on these different pieces,’ Zellner told ABC News. ‘Essentially . we've got Peterson confessing the murder of Savio to his fourth wife, . but we still have the question of whether that will come in.’ Prosecutors . will also try to admit Stacy Peterson's statements to her minister that . she saw Drew Peterson arrive home with women's clothing around the time . of Savio's death. Savio's . sister may take the stand to describe Savio's statements that Peterson . threatened her with a knife and said he could make her death look like . an accident. Missing: Peterson, right, is also the chief suspect in the disappearance of his fourth wife, Stacy Peterson, right . Taken in: Police Lt. Carl Anderson, left, and a fellow investigator escort Drew Peterson, centre, into District 5 State Police headquarters in 2009 . ‘That . doesn't concern us,’ Peterson's attorney, Joel Brodsky told ABC News . this week. ‘Anybody that knows anybody that has been through a divorce . knows that people say things and do things that is totally out of . character, and clearly Kathy was trying to build a case to try and get . as much money as she could.’ The . outcome of the trial may also hang on which forensic pathologist the . seven men and five women on the jury will believe: Bryan Mitchell or . Larry Blum. Mitchell, . who investigated Savio’s death in 2004 and ruled that a gash on her head . and bruises on her body were consistent with an accidental fall, died . earlier this year. The defense will likely call expert witnesses to . testify that the woman’s death was accidental. Blum, who investigated Savio's body . after it was exhumed in 2007, will testify for the prosecution at the . trial about what made him switch the cause of death from an accidental . fall to homicidal drowning. ‘First, they are not going to be able . to say that (the death investigation was botched) because it wasn't,’ Peterson's attorney said. ‘By saying that if they had done a better job . in the investigation, then they would have been able to prosecute Drew . Peterson, that lowers the burden of proof. Where you don't have . evidence, you presume innocence.’ Times past: Peterson, pictured on his motorcycle two months before his indictment in 2009, left, and right, with missing fourth wife Stacy Peterson .","Drew Peterson, 57, has been imprisoned for the past three years awaiting trial for the death of his third wife, Kathleen Savio .

Mitt Romney's international trip has won more critics as China and Iran both lashed out against the Republican presidential candidate for his remarks about Israel. Chinese state-run news agency Xinhua said on Tuesday that Romney risked 'reigniting war' between the Israelis and Palestinians by promising to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to the disputed holy city of Jerusalem. Meanwhile, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad the trip to the Jewish state amounted to 'kissing the foot' of Israel. Scroll down for video . Criticism: Mitt Romney called Jerusalem the capital of Israel, despite decades diplomatic disputes with the Palestinians over control of the holy city . The newest harsh words for the former Massachusetts governor's three-nation tour are unlikely to hurt Romney, though. Indeed, criticism from China, the greatest economic rival of the United States, and Iran's Ahmadinejad, one of America's prominent public villains, could even be seen as a boon. Romney returns to the United States on Wednesday after a trip that President Barack Obama's campaign aides called 'an embarrassing disaster.' 'It’s not that Romney struck out against a major league pitcher. I mean, here he struck out playing tee ball,' mused former deputy assistant Secretary of Defense for the Middle East Colin Kahl. Last week, Romney angered the British public and drew sharp criticism from Prime Minister David Cameron for questioning whether London was ready for the Olympic games. Allies: Romney pledged unmitigated support for Israel as he met with Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjiamin Netanyahu . His trip to Israel initially included a $50,000-a-plate dinner fundraiser scheduled during a Jewish day of fasting. Later, during a fundraiser, he said Israel has prospered economically over the Palestinians because of the 'culture' of its people -- drawing claims of 'racism' from Arabs and even some Jews, who said the remarks played on a dangerous stereotype. Romney's campaign has strongly denied those accusations. Critic: Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's criticism of Romney is unlikely to harm the Republican presidential candidate . On Tuesday, Romney's traveling press secretary Rick Gorka told reporters to 'kiss my a**' and 'shove it' when they shouted questions at the presumptive nominee as he left a war monument in Warsaw, Poland. China's criticism, published in an unsigned editorial by the state-run news service Xinhau, said Romney was making a reckless attempt to win Jewish votes when he called Jerusalem, the disputed city holy to Jews, Christians and Muslims, the capital of Israel and vowed to moved the US embassy there. Xinhau claimed the assertion 'is likely to worsen the already tense Mideast situation, and even reignite a war between Palestinians and Israelis.' Romney was also criticized for his 'hawkish' remarks pledging to use 'any and all measures' to stop Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. In Iran, Ahmadinejad used the opportunity of the Israeli trip to take a jab at Romney, a well. He never mentioned Romney by name, but said the visit was 'kidding the foot' of Israel. He questioned why the Republican would make 'concessions to get some pennies for (his) campaign?' Despite the media bluster, Romney's 'gaffes' on his foreign trip will have effectively zero impact on his chances in the November election. A poll in May found that only one percent of voters said foreign policy was the most important issue in the race. The foreign trip also garnered front page coverage in several newspapers in the swing states of Florida, Nevada and Ohio -- with on-message stories about his support for Israel, not articles about his slip-ups.

A quick-thinking doctor saved the life of his pet tortoise after it nearly drowned - by giving it mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. The eight-year-old reptile, Atlas, appeared to have drowned in his water bowl at Ben Waterfall's home in Swimbridge, Devon. The horrified family doctor saw the tortoise half submerged in the bowl and picked him up to find he was not breathing. One shell of a rescue: Ben Waterfall spent six minutes giving Atlas mouth to mouth after the animal fell into his water bowl . Crawling back to life: Eight-year-old Atlas was found half-submerged, with his feet sticking up out of the water bowl . But the determined 34-year-old acted fast, and spent six minutes giving his pet mouth to mouth until the tortoise started breathing again. Dr Waterfall had been tending his garden when he had walked past Atlas's run and noticed that his pet was in serious trouble. Touch and go: Dr Waterfall told his two-year-old son Harry that their pet had simply 'gone swimming' in the bowl inside his outdoor run . He said: 'I saw his back feet sticking up out of the water. I pulled him out but he was not breathing and was completely floppy. 'I did six minutes of mouth-to-mouth before he slowly started breathing and blinking.' The doctor, who works at a GP's surgery in Barnstaple, North Devon, admitted: 'I was quite emotional at the time. 'I first started doing it and I had my mouth over his whole head, mouth, nose and nostrils. Then I changed it to sort of breathing into his nostrils. 'He has a run outdoors which had some water in a concrete container about ten inches long - the same width as his shell. He had just fallen in. He was essentially dead.' Dr Waterfall's wife Subhani had been putting the couple's two-year-old son Harry to bed when her husband saved the life of their pet. The doctor told his son that Atlas had 'been swimming' because the boy was too young to understand what was really going on. The family, who also have a cat, have had Atlas for a year and Dr Waterfall said that to lose him would have been devastating. He said: 'When my wife came downstairs she said that Atlas is supposed to outlive us. He is not supposed to die young at eight years old.' Heroic act: The doctor said his colleagues at the GP's surgery thought the episode was 'hilarious' Tortoises generally have lifespans comparable with those of human beings, and some have lived for more than 150 years. The pet owner took Atlas to the vet to be checked out and he was given antibiotics in case he had any water in his lungs. 'The guys at work think it is hilarious,' added the doctor. 'There is a mixture of laughter and them kind of saying well done for giving it a go.'","The eight-year-old animal stopped breathing after he was submerged in water .

His condo, in the iconic Essex House, features a large living space, modern kitchen, and even a 40-bottle wine cooler. Gallagher paid $2.5million for the pad, the New York Observer exclusively reported- $400,000 less than the list price. A quick peep: Former Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher has purchased this two-bedroom apartment in the New York landmark Essex House; here, the living room has plenty of space for entertaining . Room with a view: The apartment is across the street from the southern entrance to Central Park . Doubling up: The second bedroom will most certainly get a rocker overhaul .

The outspoken British rocker has been vocal over his distaste for the U.S., once telling Contact Music that ‘American gigs are soul-destroying,’ as ‘there are a lot of people eating pizza.’ Moving on up: Liam Gallagher, who was the frontman of Oasis, has a piece of Manhattan to call his own . However, he seems to have gotten over that sentiment. The property was sold by Stribling’s Mary Ellen Cashman. The Essex House, one of New York City’s many landmarks, serves as both a hotel and permanent residences. It is immediately recognisable due to the neon sign on the roof 44 storeys  up that also reads ‘Essex House.’ Located on Central Park South between Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue, it sits squarely across the street from the southern edge of Central Park. Gallagher’s two bedroom, two-and-a-half bathroom property comes complete with a modern kitchen, herringbone floors, a washer and dryer in the unit, as well as access to the residence’s health club and spa. There is ample room for a dining area in the apartment’s living room. Though his accommodations are decidedly modern, many other residences within Essex House maintain their original Art Deco styling. The prime location puts the musician near Central Park, Columbus Circle, Carnegie Hall, The Russian Tea Room, and The Plaza Hotel, as well as dozens of elite dining establishments.

Lost: Cait Reilly, 22, outside the High Court today, lost her case today claiming that working at Poundland for free amounted to 'slave labour' A graduate who claimed that being made to stack shelves in Poundland on a back-to-work scheme was ‘slave labour’ yesterday lost her human rights case. The High Court ruled that the scheme was lawful and rejected Cait Reilly’s claim that the Government had infringed her rights by forcing her to work for free at the discount store. Miss Reilly, 23, had alleged that a scheme designed to encourage the long-term unemployed back to work had breached Article Four of the European Convention on Human Rights, which bans forced labour and slavery. But Mr Justice Foskett said: ‘Characterising such a scheme as involving or being analogous to “slavery” or “forced labour” seems to me to be a long way from contemporary thinking.’ He added that the scheme was ‘a very long way removed from the kind of colonial exploitation of labour that led to the formulation of Article Four’. Miss Reilly graduated from Birmingham University with a degree in geology in June 2010 and began to claim jobseeker’s allowance that August while volunteering at a local museum, The Pen Room, in the hope of getting a job. But when she made a second claim for the unemployment benefit in July last year she was told she must undergo six weeks of training, effectively forcing her to abandon her voluntary work placement and her hopes of it leading to a career. When she told her Jobcentre Plus adviser she did not want to participate she was told it was ‘mandatory’ and that she risked losing her £53.45-a-week jobseeker’s allowance if she refused. Miss Reilly said she could not afford to lose her only source of income. She was sent for a week’s training and then to the Poundland store in King’s Heath, Birmingham. She was required to sweep floors and stack shelves for five hours a day, five days a week for no pay as part of her ‘training’, it was claimed. Miss Reilly said: ‘I was actually doing something that was helping me work towards a job and was taken away from that to do something of no value to me.’ Legal challenge: Cait Reilly, pictured, was 'forced' to leave her voluntary work at a museum to stack shelves at Poundland or risk losing her benefits . She believes the placement allowed Poundland to use her and five other claimants as ‘free labour’ in the run-up to Christmas. At the High Court in London, the judge . dismissed her claim for breach of human rights but said the Department . for Work and Pensions had broken jobseekers’ regulations. She should not have been told it was . mandatory to participate in the Work Academy Scheme, but once she agreed . to take part her benefits were at risk, he said. Miss Reilly, who has since returned to her voluntary role at the museum, refused to comment on the judge’s ruling. But Work and Pensions Secretary Iain . Duncan Smith said: ‘Comparing our initiatives to slave labour is not . only ridiculous but insulting to people facing real oppression.’ The programme was designed to help . 250,000 young people gain skills through training and unpaid work . experience in the public, private and charity sectors. But it attracted . criticism when it emerged that the jobless were effectively working for . free – or for expenses.","Cait Reilly said Government programme .

Sports fans travelling to Olympic events in London faced delays today as rail and Tube services were disrupted. A signal failure this afternoon at Canary Wharf - only a few stops from the Olympic Park - meant no Docklands Light Railway (DLR) trains were able to run between Canary Wharf and nearby Westferry, causing severe delays. Earlier, passengers were stuck for about 30 minutes outside London Bridge station due to 'operating problems'. There were also problems at Cannon Street station, and Tube services on the District line were severely affected by a signal failure at Turnham Green in west London. Disruption: Passengers were stuck for about 30 minutes outside London Bridge station due to 'operating problems' The failures on the Tube had been rectified by 1pm today. It was the second day in a row that . Games visitors had been affected by transport problems. Tube services to . the Olympic Park were suspended yesterday morning after a defective . train caught fire at Leyton. The difficulty at London Bridge, thought to be a signal problem, led to delays to services run by the Southern train company in and out of the station in the morning rush-hour. London Bridge is one of the major Olympic hub stations, dealing not only with arriving commuters in the morning but those leaving to go to Olympic events. At Cannon Street, a main London terminus, a signalling problem meant there were fewer trains. This affected services run by the Southeastern train company. On the Tube, the problem at Turnham Green caused the suspension of all District line services between Earl's Court and Richmond and Ealing Broadway. The disruption affected ticket-holders wanting to watch the Olympic volleyball at Earl's Court, where the first match - a women's preliminary round game between the Dominican Republic and Japan - was due to start at 9.30am. Delays: Tube services on the District line were suspended after a signal failure . Passengers were being advised to take the Piccadilly Line instead. Transport for London said the signal problems were resolved after engineers moved on to sites at Turnham Green and Chiswick Park. Services were back to normal to and from London Bridge towards the end of the morning peak. Cannon Street services returned to normal from 10am. A recorded message from London mayor Boris Johnson warning passengers of 'huge pressure on the transport network' that was being played in London Underground stations and on buses has been discontinued. TfL said it was not part of a new strategy and it was planned that the message would only be played for a certain time. Ongoing problems: Tube services into the Olympic Park were suspended on Tuesday after a train caught fire at Leyton . The transport body said today that Tube passenger numbers were up by 7.5 per cent on Monday compared with a normal Monday, with Docklands Light Railway numbers up by a record 65 per cent. TfL warned that there would be road alterations today to cope with the Olympic road cycling time trials in and around Hampton Court and Surrey.Olympic venues in use today include Horse Guards Parade, which means that central London will be busy. TfL also said that the Tube's Jubilee line will be exceptionally busy in the early evening as events are taking place at Wembley, Lord's Cricket Ground, North Greenwich Arena, ExCeL exhibition centre in Docklands and the Olympic Park. Baker Street, Kings Cross and Green Park Tube stations were expected to be very busy with spectators going to and from Wembley. But elsewhere in the capital, roads were quiet. Westminster Bridge appeared almost empty of pedestrians and vehicles during the morning rush hour, and traffic was moving freely on Park Lane.

The boy was arrested on Monday evening on suspicion of sexual assaults on two 18-year-old women. Crime spree: Six women have been sexually assaulted in the same area of Manchester in the space of only three weeks . The women were allegedly attacked during an incident on Barnhill Street at about 4.50am on Saturday. Earlier, police confirmed that they were linking the attack to four similar assaults. The most recent attack happened in the early hours of Sunday, when a 20-year-old woman was assaulted as she made her way home.

Determined Samantha Beddows, 21, scoured the social networking site for hours looking for the man who beat up her brother Gregg, 24, in Stourbridge, West Midlands, in January this year. She had recognised the police description of the offender, who had viciously kicked Mr Beddows in the face, fracturing his cheekbone and leaving him unconscious. Social sleuth: Samantha Beddows, left, recognised her brother's attacker Gareth Collins, right, from the local pub . After turning Facebook detective, Miss Beddows was able to pin down the identity of her brother’s attacker when she spotted 23-year-old Gareth Collins bragging about the crime on his profile page. She realised she had seen him before in her local pub. She called the police after seeing he had posted a comment boasting about the savage attack saying: 'Ha, ha. Sick ain’t I?' Police arrested Collins, from Stourbridge, two days after the attack, and he told officers he had drunk six pints of lager because he was feeling down after losing his job at his uncle’s gym. He claimed he had not wanted to get into a fight and added that he had been 'showing off' when he made the comments on his Facebook site. Foiled: Clever Miss Beddows, 21, got to watch Collins being sentenced to 32 months at Wolverhampton Crown Court . Defending, Amanda Tompkins told the court her client was full of remorse. But Miss Beddows saw her devotion to her brother pay off at Wolverhampton Crown Court on Tuesday when Collins was jailed for 32 months after pleading guilty to one count of wounding. Sentencing him, Judge Amjad Nawaz said: 'It is only by hint of fortune that your kick did not do even more damage. 'Behaviour like this causes fear amongst lawful members of the public who do not want to be confronted by drunken louts.' After the case, the modest 21-year-old, speaking from her home in Stourbridge, said: 'I’m just happy he’s got what’s coming to home now. 'He’s got what he deserves and that’s all that matters. 'I’m not a hero or anything, he just shouldn’t have kicked my brother in the face. 'It’s just good to know it is all over and he’s behind bars where he should be.'

The former head of online security has admitted stealing £2.4m . A former Lloyds boss who was in charge of the bank's online security has admitted stealing £2.4million from under her bosses' noses. Jessica Harper abused her position at Lloyds Banking Group over a four-year period between 2007 and 2011. The former head of fraud and security for online digital banking submitted false invoices to claim £2,463,750.88 before laundering part of the proceeds buying property for her family. It is thought cash was also spent on improvements to a property in the south of France. Harper was arrested by the Met’s economic and specialist crime unit following a tip-off . Dressed in a black dress and cream . cardigan, 50-year-old, from Croydon, south London, spoke only to confirm her name and plead guilty to . charges of fraud and money laundering in a 10 minute hearing at . Southwark Crown Court. She admitted a single charge of fraud by abuse of position by submitting false invoices to claim payments totalling £2,463,750. She also admitted a single charge of transferring criminal property, the money, which she had defrauded from her employers. Harper is no longer an employee of the bank, which is 41 per cent owned by the taxpayer. Antony Swift, prosecuting, described Harper's crime as 'a very simple fraud' and said she . had already repaid £300,000 and was in the process of selling her house . for around £700,000. He added: 'That will be some £1 million out of £2.5 million that's gone missing.' Carol Hawley, defending, said as well as selling her home, Harper had also sold shares and cashed in her pension to repay . ‘significant sums of money’. She told the court: 'She . appreciates the seriousness and has made full admissions in interview. She understands perfectly well on the next occasion she will be facing . imprisonment of some length. 'There are some matters to attend to, . not least she is in the process of taking steps to repay significant . sums of the money that has been taken and has already cashed in her . pension and various other shares.

'As a result of that she will be able to offer something in the order of £700,000.' Prosecutor David Levy said at an . earlier hearing: ‘This lady was head of fraud and security for digital . banking for Lloyds Banking Group. ‘The Crown say she abused her position to the extent of over £2.4m obtained by her. ‘Part . of the proceeds were paid by her to her family to enable them to . purchase property, and other monies were dissipated in a variety of ways . for personal costs and use.’ ‘This is a serious and complex fraud, the amount of money involved is over £2m, and there is breach of trust as well.’ Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith bailed Harper, with conditions, ahead of sentence on September 21. Harper took the money over a four-year period while she worked as the head of fraud and security of digital banking for Lloyds Banking Group (pictured) He said: 'The Crown tell me she has . co-operated and is unlikely to flee. In those circumstances I can grant . her bail on condition of residence at her present home address. 'And there will be a curfew of 9pm to seven in the morning.' The former £70,000 a year digital banking security chief is also banned from applying for international travel documents, having previously handed her passport over to police. Harper, a keen charity worker and Rotarian, is separated from her husband John and lives with her brother Gareth Tyrrell at her £700,000 semi-detached Edwardian house in South Croydon. She also owns a second home in France where her mother Helen lives. Mr Swift, prosecuting, said he had previously raised concerns over Harper being bailed following her arrest: ‘There was some concern, as she has a mother in France and some of the money had gone to her mother and a property over there, that she may leave the jurisdiction.’ He added: ‘The Crown’s view is that she has been on bail throughout. She admitted her guilt within about ten minutes of her first interview. ‘When she was re-interviewed she admitted her guilt. She did not admit her guilt at the Magistrates’ court but an indication was given that she would plead guilty.’ Sue Patten, head of the Crown . Prosecution Service, Central Fraud Division, said: 'Jessica Harper has . today been convicted of the type of crime the bank employed her to . combat. 'The evidence in the case was clear . and left Harper with little choice but to plead guilty. In doing so, she . has admitted to a huge breach of trust against her former employer.

Almost 11,000 foreign prisoners are locked up in British jails, costing the taxpayer more than £430million per year. This means around one in eight of the prison population are from another country, with overseas inmates accounting for 10,861 of the 86,048 total. The Ministry of Justice estimates it costs £40,000 per year to keep a prisoner, which means the bill for foreigners is at least £434m. Packed cells: It costs £40,000 per year to keep a prisoner and there are 10,861 overseas inmates currently incarcerated . The number of overseas prisoners in British institutions has soared over the past 15 years, with just 4,259 locked up here in 1996 - 7.8 per cent of the prison population, as opposed to 13 per cent now. Jamaica, Poland and the Irish Republic are the countries with the most nationals in prison, according to MoJ statistics. The number of foreign prisoners is probably even higher, since another 1,929 are classified as 'nationality not recorded'. In May it emerged that more than 100 foreign criminals who the Government wants to deport are being released on to Britain’s streets every month to protect their ‘human rights’. In total, there were 3,900 overseas convicts on bail in the community, free to commit new offences. Once they have served their sentence, convicts can continue to be held only if there is a good chance of them being deported imminently. Handcuffed: The Border Agency is unable to deport more than 100 foreign criminals released from jail every month because they are initiating appeals . Otherwise, they are free to use the Human Rights Act to say they have a right to a family life in the UK - and the courts have to let them go, pending lengthy appeals. Tory MP Priti Patel, who questioned the figures in Parliament, said: 'Too many foreign nationals are enjoying themselves at taxpayers' expense in our jails. 'Foreign criminals flouting laws in Britain should be deported and ministers must get on with removing these dangerous people from our country.' A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: 'It is Government policy to extend or negotiate compulsory prisoner transfer agreements with other countries. 'We have voluntary prisoner transfer agreements with more than 100 countries, allowing prisoners to serve their sentences in their home countries. 'An agreement which means that prisoners from certain European countries can be sent home to serve their sentences without their consent has recently come into force.

These shocking satellite images show the devastating impact of the relentless fighting in Syria and reveal how both regime and rebel troops are using heavy weapons near homes. In one picture the small town of Anadan, four miles from second city Aleppo, is shown pockmarked with more than 600 craters - some located next to what appears to be a civilian housing complex. That, says Amnesty International who published the July 31 picture, is a result of the fierce fighting that is blighting the north-western city. Other images show the build-up of Syrian troops and their rebel enemies inside the city itself, while further ones detail trucks on fire and cars in line for rapidly-running out fuel. Scroll down for video . Battle scars: This is what Amnesty International believes are 600 artillery impact craters from heavy fighting between Syrian armed forces and armed opposition groups in the village of Anadan, just four miles from Aleppo . Battle: The location of probable artillery impact craters can be seen right next to civilian homes . Amnesty said it was 'alarmed' about the plight of civilians around Aleppo. And the human rights watchdog warned both forces loyal to President Bashar Assad and rebels that attacks on civilians would be documented and the culprits held accountable. Amnesty's Christoph Koettl said: 'Amnesty International is sending a clear message to both sides in the fighting. 'Any attacks against civilians will be clearly documented so that those responsible can be held accountable.' From above: The build up of artillery sites can be seen in this image . Lining up: Cars are seen queuing for fuel at one of the only petrol stations left in Aleppo . The group also said it was concerned . that the deployment of heavy weaponry in residential areas would lead to . further human rights abuses and grave breaches of international law. Koettl added: 'The Syrian military and the opposition fighters must both adhere to international humanitarian law. Syrian President Bashar Assad could seek to establish an enclave for his Alawite sect as a 'plan B' if he cannot keep control of the whole of the war-torn country, King Abdullah of Jordan has said. This, he said, could prompt decades of further problems for the region. He said: 'I have a feeling that if he can't rule greater Syria then maybe an Alawi enclave is plan B. 'That would be, I think for us, the worst case scenario because that means then the break up of greater Syria. 'And that means that everybody starts land grabbing, which makes no sense to me. 'If Syria then implodes on itself that would create problems that would take us decades to come back from.' 'It strictly forbids the use of tactics and weapons that fail to distinguish between military and civilian targets.' A senior security official said on Sunday the army had completed the buildup in Aleppo of some 20,000 troops. That was in readiness for a decisive showdown in the battle underway since July 20. The head of the United Nations observer mission in Syria, Lieutenant General Babacar Gaye, voiced concern for civilians trapped in the fighting in the city of some 2.7 million people. Rebels say they control around half of the city. Publication of the images came after Syrian rebels today said they had killed a Russian general working as an adviser to the Minister of Defence. They claimed the incident happened in an operation in the western Ghouta region on the outskirts of the capital Damascus. A video statement from the 'Hawks Special Operations Battalion...a division of the Military Leadership of Damascus City and Province', gave the name of the general as Vladimir Petrovich Kochyev. The video, sent to Reuters, showed what the rebels said was a copy of his ID, as issued by the Syrian military. The same group claimed responsibility for the assassination of four of Assad's top lieutenants in Damascus last month. There was no immediate comment from the Russian authorities. And it also came after Assad yesterday made his first appearance on state TV in nearly three weeks in a show of solidarity with a senior Iranian envoy. Battered: This image shows probable civilian-manned roadblocks of trucks and buses along many roads in . Aleppo . Shattered: Syrians through a destroyed wall as they walk on a street in Atareb, on the outskirts of Aleppo, this week . The visit to Damascus by the highest-ranking Iranian official since the uprising began coincided with a warning by an increasingly agitated Tehran that it holds the U.S. responsible for the fate of 48 Iranians seized by Syrian rebels. Appearing together on state TV, Assad and Iran's Saeed Jalili vowed to defeat the rebels and their backers, while U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton predicted Assad's regime was quickly unraveling, with high-level defections such as his prime minister's switch to the rebel side. Agony: A rebel screams in pain after being hit by shrapnel from a shell fired in the Salaheddine neighbourhood of central Aleppo yesterday . Jalili's visit highlighted Assad's deepening reliance on a shrinking list of allies, led by Tehran. Assad - seen on state TV for the first time since a July 18 bombing in Damascus killed four of his top security officials - used Jalili's visit to portray a sense of command and vowed to fight his opponents 'relentlessly'. Jalili, the secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, promised Iran would stand by Syria against its international 'enemies' - a clear reference to the rebels' Western backers and others such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar. While there were no public pledges of greater military assistance to Assad, the mission appeared to reflect Iran's efforts to reassure Syria of its backing and ease speculation that Tehran also could be making contingencies for Assad's possible fall. On a visit to South Africa, Hillary Clinton described Assad's regime as splintering from Monday's defection of Syria's prime minister, Riad Hijab, and other military and political figures breaking away in recent months. She urged international leaders to begin work on a 'good transition plan' to try to keep Syria from collapsing into more chaos after Assad. 'I am not going to put a timeline on it. I can't possibly predict it, but I know it's going to happen as do most observers around the world,' Clinton told reporters. A post-Assad Syria presents a host of worrisome scenarios, including a bloody cycle of revenge and power grabs by the country's patchwork of factions, including the Sunni-led rebels and Assad's minority Alawites, an offshoot of Shiite Islam allied with Shiite Iran. Despite a ferocious government crackdown, the Syrian rebels have grown more confident and are using increasingly bolder tactics. They seized the 48 Iranians in a bold daylight attack near Damascus on Saturday, claiming they were members of Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guards sent on a 'reconnaissance mission' to assist in Assad's crackdown.

Ruins: Syrians inspect damages in the Bustan al-Qasr district of Aleppo . Iran says the Iranians, who were captured when their bus was commandeered near the airport, were pilgrims visiting a Shiite shrine on the outskirts of Damascus. Iran issued a flurry of appeals for their release on Tuesday, with Jalili saying that Iran would spare no effort to secure their freedom. 'We believe that the abduction of innocent people could not be accepted by any rational person. We believe that the parties that support those terrorist groups to commit such disgraceful acts, are their partners,' he said. In a pointed message to the Obama administration, Iran's Foreign Ministry said that it holds the U.S. responsible for the fate of the abducted Iranians. On the run: A Free Syrian Army fighter during clashes with Syrian Army in Aleppo . Meanwhile, a growing humanitarian crisis was already taking hold in Syria. More than 1,300 Syrians fled to Turkey on Tuesday as rebels tried to expand their hold inside Aleppo, Syria's largest city, despite two weeks of withering counterattacks by Assad's troops. Close to 48,000 Syrians have already taken refuge in Turkey, which has served as a staging ground for rebels. Even more refugees have crossed into Jordan and Lebanon. And at least 22,300 Iraqis who fled to Syria several years ago have streamed home in the past three weeks, said UN officials in Baghdad as they prepared for more refugees. In Geneva, meanwhile, the World Health Organization said the fighting has severely hit Syria's health services, including closing down 90 per cent of pharmaceutical plants in Damascus and other main cities and leaving critical shortages of medicine. WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic cited a Syrian Health Ministry report that 200 ambulances were lost in recent weeks to theft or clashes. Aleppo-based activists said clashes were going on Tuesday near the historic city center. That suggested the rebels were making some inroads in Aleppo, which lies some 25 miles from the Turkish border. Intense government bombardment of the . Syrian town of Tal Rafaat closer to the border sent scores of people . spilling into Turkey for safety, according to the activists. A Turkish government official said 1,328 Syrian refugees had crossed the border Tuesday - nearly double the number of the previous day. Ahmad Saleh, a Tal Rifaat resident who fled to Turkey, said the town was shelled Monday from the nearby air base of Minnegh, killing at least two people. 'We had to choose between dying in Syria and coming to Turkey,' he said. A video posted online by activists Tuesday showed a large group of Free Syrian Army rebels in military fatigues and carrying rocket-propelled grenades and automatic rifles. The fighters were seen announcing that they were joining the Unification Brigade, the main group of rebels in Aleppo, to assist in the 'liberation' of the city.

As Aly Raisman triumphantly raised her arms at the end of her gold medal-winning performance yesterday, the entire arena appeared to be cheering - except this guy. The grouchy gentleman may argue that he had the worst seat in the house during the women's gymnastics floor exercise final, right behind Raisman's jubilant parents. Sporting a preppy look with a white t-shirt and a green sweater over his shoulders, he cannot keep his exasperation a secret as Lynn and Rick Raisman celebrate their daughter's routine, which made her the first American woman to strike gold in the event. Down in front: The spectator, pictured here between Aly Raisman's parents, shoots Rick Raisman an angry look as he cheers for his daughter . Golden girl: Aly Raisman won a gold medal in the women's floor exercise final on Tuesday, her second in London . The parents' merriment as their daughter completed the floor exercise for the gold medal was so unbearable to the crabby codger that he motions with his hands for them to sit down at one point. When that wouldn’t work, he could be seen burying his face in his hands in exasperation. It was Raisman's second gold medal and her third overall in the 2012 Olympics. She picked up a bronze medal earlier in the day in the balance beam. Though Raisman has made a huge splash in London, her parents are in no way getting used to it. Sit down: As Rick Raisman stands to get a better look at his daughter, the man can be seen waving his hand in an effort to get him to sit back down . A hilarious video of the couple from the all-around qualification round on July 29 showed them contorting their bodies almost in sync with their daughter as she performed on the uneven bars. Mrs Raisman, a former gymnast herself, keeps repeating ‘let’s go’ as she lurches to the side to get a better view. Exasperated: As the Raismans clap and cheer for their daughter, the man appears to give up . Sensation: Though Raisman has made a huge splash in London, her parents are in no way getting used to it . And at the end the two both chant ‘Stick it! Stick it!’ and fist pump in the air as their daughter got a great score. The video of the Raismans became an internet sensation - even though they claimed they were actually . trying to be quiet so as not to distract Aly. But their reaction was understandable as they have been . planning Aly’s success since she was 18 months old when Mrs Raisman took her to . ‘Mommy & Me’ gym classes.

In the 50 . second video Mr and Mrs Raisman can be seen leaning over to their right . as Mrs Raisman mouths to herself again and again: ‘Come on Aly, let’s . go’. Aly scored 14.166, which lifted her to an . overall score of 60.391, the top score by an American. In an interview with WHDH, Mrs Raisman admitted that she burst into tears when she saw the result. Critical: Mr and Mrs Raisman flinch and draw back in their seats . Workout: Mrs Raisman leans to her right as she mimics Aly's moves .

Several U.S. Olympians are crying foul over a few violent incidents in competition, arguing that some of their opponents should be awarded a gold medal for cheap shots. It's part of a grueling back-and-forth between American athletes and their international rivals, particularly in men's basketball and women's soccer. Forward Carmelo Anthony was shooting a three-pointer in the closing seconds of a game against Argentina on Monday night when guard Facundo Campazzo struck him in the groin. Low blow: Carmelo Anthony was left howling in pain on the court after he was struck in the groin by Argentinian guard Facundo Campazzo . Attack: Campazzo can be seen hitting Anthony in this footage from the game on Monday . The ball landed in the basket, but Anthony, who plays for the New York Knicks stateside, hit the floor. Speaking at a team practice on the day after the Americans' 126-97 victory, Anthony said: 'It was definitely a cheap shot. 'Something like that, I don't play like that, I don't agree with that.' He added: 'If you're going to foul . somebody ... foul them hard, but you don't take a shot like that. So I . don't agree with that, but at this point there's really nothing that . nobody can do about it.' The play happened in front of the U.S. bench, and Anthony's teammates were irate as he fell to the court in pain. Backing: Anthony's teammates rushed to his defence after the incident . Fight: An altercation erupted on the court as Team USA reacted to the 'cheap shot' Anthony said they were angry because they knew it was 'uncalled for' and wouldn't happen in the NBA. 'Nobody takes cheap shots like that,' Anthony said. 'That was a cheap shot. He got one, he took it, he got away with it. There's nothing we can do about it.' Campazzo said after the game he apologized to Kobe Bryant but not to Anthony, because Chris Paul hadn't apologized for punching him earlier in the game. Anthony and coach Mike Krzyzewski said they hadn't watched a replay but were putting the incident behind them and looking toward Wednesday's quarterfinal game against Australia. Also on Monday, the U.S. victory in the . women's soccer semi-final against Canada was marred by a similar cheap . shot when a Canadian player appeared to stomp on midfielder . Carli Lloyd's neck. A kick in the head: Carli Lloyd appeared to have been stomped on by Canadian forward Melissa Tancredi during the women's soccer semi-finals on Monday . Agony: The shot left Lloyd writhing on the field in pain, and no whistle was blown . It was the latest in a string of incidents that have created bad blood between the U.S. team and their neighbours to the north, as Canadian forward Melissa Tancredi made the startling assault. The attack came after numerous pre-game remarks by Canadian players and their coach, John Herdman. Prior to the match, which the U.S. won 4-3, Herdman accused the U.S. of using 'highly illegal' blocking tactics on their corners and free kicks. The Canadians claimed it was Team USA . who were playing dirty and Tancredi herself addressed a referee . when she said: 'I hope you can sleep tonight and put on your American . jersey because that’s who you played for today.' Winning: The U.S. women's soccer team defeated Canada 4-3, thanks to an overtime goal by Alex Morgan . It's wasn't the first time the U.S. has been accused of playing dirty during the London games. Colombian soccer player Lady Andrade, who was suspended last month after 'sucker punching' Wambach, said that it was the Americans who struck first. 'The whistle always goes in their favour,' she insisted. 'They were hitting us and hitting us, but there was never a whistle.'","No call on Argentinian guard Facundo Campazzo, who struck U.S. forward Carmelo Anthony in the groin on Monday night .

"Stephen Hodson weighed 30 stone 12lbs and gorged on 6,000 calories daily . Now weighs 14st 10lbs after 1,200 . calorie-a-day diet . By . Bianca London . PUBLISHED: . 05:51 EST, 26 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:28 EST, 26 June 2012 . Stephen Hodson accomplished a huge weight loss achievement when he shed an impressive 16 stone in just 18 months. But instead of celebrating his weight loss success, the 32-year-old virgin has been left feeling insecure and unattractive after the weight loss has left with huge flaps of skin all over his body. Blaming his saggy skin for his unlucky love life, Stephen is desperate to make drastic changes. Stephen Hodson lost a remarkable 16 stone in just 18 months but is still unlucky in love after he has been left with handfuls of skin flaps . Stephen, who consumed a stomach-churning 6,000 calories a day, decided to go on a diet in order to find love . The NHS clinical auditor decided to take control of his weight after tipping the scales at 30 stone 12lbs with a whopping 68in waistline after years of gorging on takeaways and beer. He consumed a stomach-churning 6,000 calories a day but decided to go on a diet in order to find love. Stephen even hired a personal trainer after he got stuck in a caravan while on holiday in August 2010. After 18 months eating just 1,200 calories a day and exercising for up to two hours a day he now weighs a svelte 14st 10lbs and has a size 38in waist. But Stephen, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs., says he is still scared to go on a date in case his saggy skin repels women and still has to wear extra-baggy clothes in order to hide his unsightly skin. He said: 'From an appearance point of view it’s just as embarrassing to have the loose skin as it was being 30 stone. 'People don’t point in the street like they used to but I know it is under my clothes and it affects my confidence. It’s heavy and uncomfortable and when I am naked the skin hangs down over my genitalia. Stephen even hired a personal trainer after he got stuck in a caravan while on holiday in August 2010 . Stephen survived on just 1,200 calories a day for 18 months . 'I lost the weight because I wanted to find Miss Right and to feel healthier but I’m afraid that if I did pull I’d put them off because of my saggy body. The saggy skin caused by the weight loss has made Stephen shy and the thought of taking his shirt off fills him with fear, especially when on holiday with his friends. Sometimes he even has to tuck it in which he finds wholly embarrassing. Stephen, who works at University Hospital North Staffordshire, was twice turned down for a £10,000 operation to have the excess skin removed. But after losing even more weight, the NHS changed their decision and he will go under the knife to remove the skin from his chest, stomach, groin, arms and legs in August. Despite his huge weight loss, he is still too embarrassed to take his top of because of his flappy skin . Stephen hopes that surgery to remove the excess skin with help his love life . He originally applied to have the operation done when he was 18 stone after his doctor told him he needed to take action but the NHS board twice refused his application. Luckily for Stephen, this year they decided he met the criteria. 'One of the reasons was because I had lost over half my body weight and the other was that my BMI was still above the level it should be for a man of my current weight. 'What they do is they cut across your abdomen and they roll it out. It sounds really crude but they just cut it off. 'And they have to take my belly button and nipples off and then re-position them and sew them back on. 'I won’t have a body ready to show off this summer but I’ll hopefully look good in time for the Christmas party season. 'I just can’t wait to start dating. I just hope women find me attractive,' he says. After the operation, Stephen is expected to weigh just 13-and-a-half stone.","Stephen Hodson weighed 30 stone 12lbs and gorged on 6,000 calories daily .

But Nicola Adams grew up to fight her way to the top in one of the toughest of sports for a woman – boxing. Last night the determined 29-year-old was on the brink of fulfilling her 17-year dream to win an Olympic gold medal. Scroll down to hear about Nicola's preparations . Moment to savour: Adams (left) is declared the winner over Kom at the ExCel Arena . The original Babyface: With pigtails at the age of seven . The Leeds flyweight, who almost gave up the sport four years ago due to a lack of funding, beat India’s Mary Kom to earn a place in today’s final. She punched her way to an 11-6 victory at the ExCel arena, in front of a cheering crowd which included David Cameron and boxing icon Amir Khan. Today she faces China’s world number one Ren Cancan, and is clearly in the mood to win. ‘I massively want that gold,’ she said. ‘Words can’t express how much. It will mean everything to me. All I want to do is make my mum and my family and friends proud.’ Packs a punch: Great Britain's Nicola Adams (right) competes against India's Mary Kom . Close call: Indian superstar Kom (right) gets to grips with British fighter Adams . It would be the culmination of . Nicola’s remarkable journey from a housing estate in Leeds, smashing . through glass ceilings in a sport that was previously regarded as . suitable only for men. For years her mother Dee, 52, tirelessly chased potential sponsors – but not a single person or company ever put up a penny. Nicola . discovered boxing by chance when she was 12, and her mother took her . and younger brother Kurtis along to a keep fit class at a gym in . Burmantofts, Leeds. In the crowd: Prime Minister David Cameron (left) watched the fight alongside former world champion Amir Khan . The gym had a boxing ring and the . children would ‘mess about and do some boxing’, Mrs Adams said. ‘I . didn’t really notice what she was up to, when I looked over she would be . boxing or running around.’ When she was 13, Nicola won an exhibition match against another girl. She wasn’t able to fight again until she was 17, this time in a proper Amateur Boxing Association bout. Meeting an icon: Nicola accepts an award from boxer Amir Kahn in 2007 . At that stage, female boxing opponents were in short supply. There was only one other girl boxer in the country and Nicola was forced to go abroad to fight. In . 2001 she became the first female boxer to represent England; in 2007 . the first to win a European boxing medal and the following year the . first to win a World Championship medal. But in 2009 her dreams  were almost shattered when she tripped over a bandage on the stairs at home and cracked a vertebra. She spent most of the next three months in a body brace, lying on her back in bed. Ironically, boxing had just been accepted as an Olympic sport and Nicola was not fit enough to try for the new Team GB squad. But despite being barely able to train or punch, she did enough to be selected and has never looked back. In Burmantofts, she is regarded as a celebrity and role model. ‘Everyone is very inspired by her,’ said Mrs Adams. ‘Me – I couldn’t be prouder. ‘To hear 10,000 people cheering for your daughter is just something else.

Kevin Lee's lavish weddings allegedly inspired Franck, the flamboyant character played by Martin Short in 1991's Father Of The Bride. But the Los Angeles-based events expert who also appears on The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills, claims that a beautiful, memorable wedding does not require a fortune to fund it. The reality TV star said on Good Morning America this morning that there are plenty of options out there for brides who are planning their special day while on a budget. Mr Lee, who was the brains behind . the weddings of Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt as well as Bill and . Giuliana Rancic, offered advice on everything from dining and . entertainment to the invitations. 'Order invitations online,' he advised. An endless stream of online options are said to provide much cheaper alternatives to those offered in store. He also suggested that couples . arrange for buffet stations to cater for their guests at the reception . as they will 'save money compared to sit-down plater service which . requires wait staff'. A live musical act also tends to send costs soaring. The expert, who claimed that his . clients tend to easily spend $40,000 on flowers alone as they plan their . weddings, advised couples to hire a DJ. If live music is an absolute must, . arrange for the DJ to be accompanied by 'a couple of live instruments' rather than hunting down a full live band.

Mr Lee advised brides to rent a high-end designer gown as opposed to . buying one as women only wear their dresses once after all. 'I'm here to just [help] them to make them happy,' he said.

A grieving widower is suing a hospital after his wife collapsed and died from a massive stroke - just hours after she was sent home accused of pretending to be ill. Philip Maddox, 58, was told by doctors his wife Maggie, 53, needed psychiatric help because they could find nothing wrong with her despite her complaining she was in agony with severe headaches and vomiting. An inquest heard she first went to Darent Valley Hospital in Dartford, Kent, on June 14, 2010, but was sent home, having been told there was nothing wrong with her. Phillip Maddox holds a picture of his wife, who died in June 2010. She went back to the hospital three times before they then diagnosed a massive stroke . Then her husband took her back there 10 days later, on June 24, when she suffered similar symptoms including dizziness. Maggie was discharged again - against her wishes - but that night at home she continued to complain she felt unwell and was driven back to the hospital by her son because Philip had to go to work. She collapsed in the hospital car park. Staff got her into a wheelchair and took her into the Accident and Emergency department, but a nurse told her to 'stop shouting and making a fuss'. Still, doctors did not seem to take Maggie's complaints seriously and left her in the waiting area. Finally, she was admitted and a consultant diagnosed she had suffered a massive stroke. Maggie, who worked in the Asda transport department, died three days later. Her death has devastated her husband and their daughter Leah, 28, and 26-year-old son Blake. To make matters worse, the family were subsequently told some of her medical records had not been properly kept and her discharge notes from June 24 had gone missing. Mr Maddox said he trusted hospital staff that there was nothing wrong with his wife, even though she was in agony . Philip, a retired prison governor, . from Dartford, said: 'When I first took Maggie into hospital they . checked her over but said they couldn't find anything wrong with her. 'She was in agony but I took their word for it because they're supposed to be the experts. 'The . second time I took Maggie to hospital the doctors said she had . psychological issues. They were saying she was pretending to be ill or . was convincing herself she was ill when she wasn't. 'All . the time Maggie was insisting she was ill but no one listened to her. She was vomiting in the bin in the hospital and complaining of a violent . headache. 'My daughter . and I asked the doctor to refer her to a psychiatrist but he said he . couldn't and advised us to take Maggie to her GP who could do that. 'Maggie . didn't want to leave the hospital but the doctor said if we couldn't . move her from the bed, security would have to do it. We had to bundle . her out in a wheelchair. 'It was such a distressing time because Maggie was moaning loudly in pain and the staff just thought she was making it up.' Mr Maddox said his wife didn't want to leave the hospital the second time, but doctors said they would call security if they didn't go . He said she seemed to start feeling better that evening at home but in the early hours she woke up in pain, again complaining of the same symptoms. Philip added: 'I felt terrible because I had to go into work that morning so I got my son to take Maggie to the hospital even though I really wanted to be with her. I felt bad because I had already taken some time off work to deal with this. 'But when they got there Maggie collapsed in the car park. My son said it was obvious she was in a very bad way but the doctors and nurses still seemed unconvinced she was really ill.' At an inquest the coroner Roger Hatch concluded she died from natural causes. He said he was satisfied Maggie's stroke 'presented at a time which would not have changed the outcome'. Mr Hatch added there would be 'no useful purpose' in making a formal recommendation on medical notes and records-keeping because this was an 'isolated' incident. Philip had been hoping for an 'open' verdict. However, he is still pressing ahead with a private legal action alleging breach of duty by the medical staff on June 24. Richard Norman of solicitors Leo Abse and Cohen, said: 'We have taken expert medical opinion and we feel there is a case to answer for breach of duty. 'Now we are in the process of trying to establish, again through expert medical opinion, if that breach of duty affected the outcome.' In a statement, Darent Valley Hospital NHS Trust said: 'After a thorough investigation into the facts and hearing the statements and evidence from all parties, the Coroner concluded that the care and treatment Mrs Maddox received at the hospital had been entirely appropriate and that she died of natural causes. 'We are completely satisfied that our doctors treated Mrs Maddox properly and that all of the necessary tests and investigations were performed. We offer our sincere condolences to the family and understand how difficult and distressing it can be to lose a loved one.'","Mother-of-two was suffering violent headaches and vomiting .

'But around my 40th birthday I remember seeing myself in the mirror and thinking my body was close to giving up. 'I knew that I had to change otherwise I'd leave my children motherless.' Marie had piled on the pounds after her mother died in her arms from a heart attack. She bulged from a petite nine stone 16-year-old to 50 stone on her 40th birthday after comfort eating to cope with the loss. Two years ago Marie Eaton weighed 50st. The mother-of-four (pictured with husband Paul, Alice 8, Emily 11 and Lucy 12) now weighs 18.5st . Her . constant scoffing lead to her becoming one of Britain's fattest women - . rendering her completely house-bound and suffering from agoraphobia as a . result. Marie explained: 'I was normal weight up until I was sixteen. But then my mum died, and it hit me really hard. 'She died of a heart attack in my arms. She was with us one minute and gone the next.From that moment onwards I comfort ate. It was my way of coping with the trauma of it all. 'It just spiralled from there. My social life diminished as I hid myself away. 'I . was so ashamed, I stayed at home and became agoraphobic. I knew that . the sofa wouldn't collapse beneath me unlike chairs in public. 'I couldn't be embarrassed about my weight if I was locked away at home out of sight.' Marie, pictured in 2010, says she started to pile on the pounds after her mother died in her arms when she was just a teenager . 50ST MENU .

Marie . said: 'Paul proposing to me focused my mind and gave me that incentive . to lose weight. I didn't want to look horrendous in my lovely white . wedding dress.' Marie went on a strict diet consuming just 800 calories a day. She . binned the two-litres of fizzy drinks, endless supplies of multi-pack . crisps, six chocolate bars and two sausage rolls a day and replaced them . with salads, white meat and water. After losing 15 stone through the . diet, doctors advised her to have a gastric sleeve - cutting her . stomach's size by 25 per cent - in a bid to prevent her returning to her . old ways. With the help of a personal trainer the pounds continued to slip off, and Marie lost a further 16 stone. When . she walked down the aisle on November 5, 2011, Marie weighed just 21 . stone. After continuing to work out she now weighs 18 and a half stone. A jubilant Marie added: 'Every woman . wants to look a million dollars on their wedding day, and I was no . different. It became an obsession to lose the weight in time. 'Changing . my diet has been the biggest difference. Just not snacking and . switching my food types has helped me shed most of my weight. 'I got a personal trainer and slowly but surely the pounds just fell off. 'At the wedding I weighed well over half what I did at my worst. 'Family members who hadn't seen me for a while, were gobsmacked - they barely recognised me.They thought they were at the wrong wedding. It made me feel so proud. 'I'm . loving life again and have started up a group to help other people . looking to lose weight. I want to share my experience and help others.'

A mother has told how she believed her child was the Anti-Christ as she endured traumatic hallucinations after giving birth to her son. Tracy Vicker seemed like the perfect mother - breastfeeding her baby son, keeping the house clean and baking cakes, but she was going through a secret trauma. She told Cheltenham Science Festival she had become convinced her baby had the face of the Devil. A mother's trauma: Tracey Vicker said she started suffering terrible hallucinations as soon as she had given birth (file picture) 'I had my son in 2007. Immediately after his traumatic birth, I knew something was wrong,' she said. 'I had it in my head that he had died during childbirth. By the time I got home, I was completely loopy. I was convinced I'd given birth to the Anti-Christ and that was my role. 'Every time I looked at him, I saw the face of the devil. I saw dancing little devils in the room. When I breastfed, I was afraid he would eat off my chest. 'On the outside I seemed to be Super Mum but on the inside everything was crumbling apart. 'I told my husband I was going to open a goat farm in a warehouse in the middle of Glasgow and feed milk to asylum seekers. I couldn't understand why he didn't think it was a good idea. 'My husband thought I was losing it and the midwives thought I was doing really well until they started asking all the questions and realised things weren't right.' Tracy, who now lives near Bridgend, South Wales, said she was diagnosed with post-natal depression - but she was actually suffering from post-partum psychosis, which is experienced by an estimated 1 in 1,000 new mothers in the UK every year. She added: 'I had to go and be part of a depressed people group but I was on a complete high and they were all sitting around crying. It was the wrong treatment for me.' Tracy didn't get any medication at all and it took nine months for the psychosis to tail off. She said she was frightened about having another child but when she was pregnant and had a daughter in 2009 she had support from a psychiatric nurse. 'For the first couple of hours after the birth I felt great but it was when I got home things started to go wonky again,' she said. Trauma: Tracy was suffering from post-partum psychosis but was incorrectly diagnosed (picture posed by models) 'This time I had dripping dead torsos living at the bottom of the garden. Part of their bodies would come whizzing at the windows of the house. I told my husband and psychiatric nurse.' Tracy declined medication because she preferred to breastfeed her daughter, and because the mother and baby unit was full, her husband had to give up his job to help with round-the-clock care for her at home. She said she was not having any more children because she doesn't want to go through the hallucinations again. Tracy, a member of Action on Post-Partum Psychosis, which has a website providing information and support, believes that post-partum psychosis, should be discussed with expectant mothers along with post-natal depression, so that they are informed and can seek help if it happens to them. 'I had no idea about it. I'd never heard of it before. It should definitely be discussed to raise awareness among women - not to frighten them. 'If my husband had known about it, he might have picked up on my illness quicker. At the time, he just thought he was losing his wife.' Clare Dolman, chair of Bi-Polar UK, who has also suffered post-partum psychosis, said: 'It's such a tragedy. Loads of midwives actually don't even know what post-partum psychosis is. 'It was illustrated very well for me by a woman who had a very bad episode out of the blue. 'In one of her ante-natal classes she had seen one leaflet which talked about post-natal depression and three lines about post-partum psychosis. 'When she was manic, she thought she might have what was in the leaflet and they got the doctors in to see her. 'When you are feeling really great in pregnancy, you are not going to think you're going to get it, but if you just hear about it - what it is - it might trigger something if you notice a relative or friend behaving bizarrely after birth.' Dr Ian Jones, a perinatal psychologist at Cardiff MRC Centre for Neurosciences and Genomics, said the 'airbrushed image of perfection' of new mothers was not the experience for many women. There was a long history of a link between psychiatric illness and childbirth. 'Baby blues' affect half or more of new mothers, while post-natal depression affects affects up to fifteen percent and puerperal or post-partum psychosis is suffered by 1 in 1,000 which means that thousands of mothers are affected every year. 'It's a severe psychosis with mixed mood symptoms. It's a psychiatric emergency. Ideally, the mother and baby need to be taken to a specialist mother and baby unit,' Dr Jones said. Research in Cardiff had shown that the big shifts in hormone levels during the first three or four days after birth, plus the effect of sleep disruption, could trigger psychiatric illness - particularly in bi-polar women. There was evidence that genetic factors could be involved - meaning that the risk could run in families.","Tracy Vicker was convinced her baby boy had the face of the devil .

Thomas Fortenberry had organised a ‘Fear Factor’ reality-style contest for the girls which saw him drizzle them in the sticky substance. The girls, two of whom were 15 and two were 17, were then told to wash the honey off their bodies – during which they were allegedly filmed by a camera Fortenberry had hidden in the bathroom at the Greater Harvest Community Church in Pasadena, Texas.The matter only came to light after Fortenberry, then 26, began a relationship with one of the girls and confessed to her after they became engaged, The Smoking Gun reported. When questioned by police, Fortenberry did not deny filming the teenagers, the website claims. ‘The defendant would only say that he has done things that he should not have done.’Today Texas prosecutors announced they could not pursue charges against Fortenberry since the incident occurred more than three years ago in 2007, making it beyond the statute of limitations for an improper photography/ visual recording count. Felony complaints, which were filed against Fortenberry earlier this week, were today dismissed by the Harris County District Attorney’s Office.

A teenager trapped in a car with a drunk joy-rider sent a final text to her boyfriend saying 'if I die, you were the one' moments before she was killed. Mikeala Stevens, 17, died when her best friend - who had been on a drink and drugs binge - drove a stolen car into a telegraph pole at 60mph  in Croydon, South London. Moments before Miss Stevens sent a text . message to her boyfriend, Jemel, which read: 'I ain't lying, believe me . baby, please, if I die, you were the one.' He then asked her to telephone him which she did and he heard screaming before a loud bang and then the line went dead. Georgia Marney, now 18, had stolen her mother's car before picking up . friends, including Miss Stevens, for a joyride near their homes in New . Addington, in August 2010. Marney, who had been smoking cannabis and drinking, ignored the 'terrorised' screams of her friends as she drove 'like a lunatic' before losing control, a court heard. Another friend Charlotte Reid, who was . also in the car, suffered horrific injuries to her legs and will need . treatment for years to come. Yesterday, Marney was jailed for three-and-a-half years. Georgia Marney outside Croydon Crown Court shortly before she was jailed. She had been on a drink and drugs binge before stealing her mother's car and picking up friends . Recorder of Croydon Warwick McKinnon said: 'No sentence that I can pass today will turn the clock back. I only wish it could.' Sarah . Whitehouse, prosecuting, said Marney met up with Miss Stevens and Miss . Reid at Miss Stevens' house on August 27th, 2010, around 7pm. She had taken a case of lager and the three of them shared bottles of Stella Artois. After . that, the group separated and Marney went to a party where where . alcohol and cannabis was present. It is not known how much she drank. She then went home and stole her mother's car before driving to Miss Stevens' house where she and Miss Reid climbed in. Ms . Whitehouse said another friend refused to get in the car and described . Marney's appearance as being 'unresponsive' and she was staring at the . windscreen. She said she drove the car away, skimming the kerb as she did so. Ms Whitehouse added: 'The only account of what happened comes from Miss Reid. At first the driving was relatively normal, but as they approached a local industrial estate her speed increased and her passengers became very scared. 'Miss Reid says that the car was travelling so fast she could not see the houses going past and she estimated they were going at 80mph. An expert has said this would be about 60mph. 'Mikeala was screaming in fear and she and Miss Reid asked her to slow down.' When the car hit the telegraph pole Miss Stevens was thrown from the vehicle and Miss Reid was knocked unconscious. Miss Whitehouse said Marney was heard to say 'I'm sorry, I was just trying to scare you' and 'don't tell them I was driving', but when police officers arrived she became verbally abusive, calling them 'c***s' and declining to have a breath test. When interviewed by detectives, Marney admitted that Miss Reid had asked her to slow down. She admitted drinking alcohol and taking a small amount of cannabis, but Miss Whitehouse added: 'We will never know what the level of alcohol or cannabis in her blood was.' Ciara Mackle-Vogue, in mitigation for Marney, described her as 'traumatised' by the loss of her best friend and referred to a psychiatric report which said she may be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and moderate depression as a result of the incident. She said: 'Following the collision, before the police officers arrived at the scene, Miss Marney was the first person to get out of the car. 'She approached the deceased and cradled her in her arms, traumatised by the shock of what she had done to her best friend.' Marney was also banned from driving for five years. Mr McKinnon said: 'What a dreadful example of the folly of youth that of your own free will you committed this grave and wicked offences. 'You drove at a vastly excessive speed, you ignored the terrorised screams from you friends to slow down, leaving behind a trail of devastation. 'It is clear that Mikeala was larger than life and her family are devastated. Marney, who pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving, by driving whilst unlicensed and whilst uninsured as well as aggravated vehicle taking and inflicting GBH, showed little emotion as she was sentenced.","Mikeala Stevens phoned boyfriend who heard screams, a bang and then the line go dead .

The head of Tesco’s UK business will step down later this year as he pays the price for a disastrous winter. Richard Brasher, a long-serving director, took on the role last March but oversaw the supermarket’s worst Christmas trading performance for many years. His position will be taken on by group chief executive Philip Clarke, who has pledged a much closer involvement in the UK business. There were reports of tensions between the two men after its Big Price Drop campaign flopped, prompting a near £5 billion slump in its market value. Mr Clarke told Reuters that Mr Brasher recognised 'you can’t have two captains in a team.' He added: 'This greater focus will allow me to oversee the improvements that are so important for customers.' Tesco said Mr Brasher will leave the business in July once he has overseen the handover of responsibilities to Mr Clarke. He will leave behind a UK business which has very strong plans for improvement, and over the last two months these plans are beginning to show progress, in line with our expectations,' Mr Clarke added. Mr Clarke has already revealed he plans to cram a three-year overhaul into the next 12 months, including a raft of initiatives dealing with online, price and home delivery. Mr Brasher was appointed to the board eight years ago, having joined Tesco in 1986. He has held a number of marketing, commercial and store operations positions, before being appointed UK and Ireland boss in March 2011. Tesco’s share of the sector has . slipped from 30.3 per cent a year ago to 29.7 per cent in the 12 weeks to February 19, a . level last seen in May 2005. The supermarket, Britain’s biggest . retailer, has announced plans to open new stores and create 20,000 jobs . over the next two years as it battles back from its first profit warning . in living memory. Mr Brasher with Prime Minister David Cameron at a branch of the food retailer earlier this month . Philip Clarke (pictured) will take over from Mr Brasher, who quit after just one year as Tesco's UK boss . It recently declared it was planning a . shake-up that would see ranges and price discounts  tailored to the . incomes of local families. The strategy – spearheaded by Mr . Brasher – was designed to breathe life into UK sales after a disastrous . fall in Christmas takings. Mr Brasher, who is Chief Executive of UK Operations, was also the man behind Tesco’s ‘Big Price Drop’ campaign, which failed to deliver the boost in sales and profits the company was looking for . The supermarket launched its price drop campaign on September 27, just days before announcing their worst sales figures in 20 years. They fell by almost 1 per cent as customers bought less food, switched to budget rivals and turned away from luxury purchases. The ‘Big Price Drop’ campaign, which promised annual savings worth £500million, was part of an attempt by Tesco to be recast as a champion of low prices. However customers, who continued to see the cost of their weekly shopping increase, were not convinced. Tesco was also censured by advertising watchdogs over a price comparison campaign in which the supermarket giant claimed to be so confident it was cheaper than Asda and other rivals, that it would refund double the difference on any basket of groceries. At Christmas, Tesco offered a half-price frozen turkey in an attempt to rival other supermarkets. But it was later discovered competitors were selling their own frozen turkeys for around the same price – without the supposed 50 per cent discount. Former group chief executive Sir Terry . Leahy led the chain for more than 13 years and oversaw its rise to . become the UK’s leading supermarket. Failed strategy: Mr Brasher was behind Tesco's 'Big Price Drop' campaign, which failed to deliver the boost in sales and profits the company was looking for . During his time in charge, he took its annual pre-tax profits from £750million to more than £3billion, . But Tesco’s performance in the UK started to falter in the last years of his tenure and has continued to lag behind its main competitors in recent months. Underlying sales in the crucial Christmas trading period showed an annual fall of 2.3 per cent, bringing warnings that profits at the supermarket chain will not grow as expected and wiping almost £5billion off the share price. Mr Brasher was appointed to the board eight years ago, having joined Tesco in 1986. He has held a number of marketing, commercial and store operations positions, before being appointed UK and Ireland boss in March 2011. Independent retail analyst Nick Bubb said it was not a good sign for the business when the chief executive has to 'micro manage' the UK operation. He added: 'Given the rumoured tensions between the two of them over the scale of the price cuts in the Price Drop, Mr Clarke ultimately had to back Mr Brasher or sack him, but the cracks are showing and it is hard to see how this will end happily.' While Tesco shares were 1 per cent lower today, Panmure Gordon analyst Philip Dorgan kept his buy rating and said he believed the UK business will recover. He added: 'Having a group chief executive and a chief executive of the UK is all very well when things are going swimmingly. 'However, with the UK 70 per cent of the business and underperforming, it becomes difficult to have two captains on the bridge. Therefore, the departure of Richard Brasher is a sad, but perhaps inevitable, consequence of the recent profit warning.'","Grocery giant's market share has fallen to 2005 levels .

"By . Julian Gavaghan . PUBLISHED: . 10:59 EST, 18 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:54 EST, 21 May 2012 . A mother who arranged for her 13-year-old daughter’s boyfriend to be battered to death after he posted topless pictures of the girl on the internet is facing jail today. Gedu Bibi, 47, lured 21 year-old hospital worker Sumon Miah to her home after being shown the photos of Shuhina Khanam. Once there he was hit over the with a table leg and fell into a coma from which he never recovered. Mr Miah died nine days later from brain damage on October 17, 2006. Claims: Dobir Miah, left, is charged with perverting course of justice after allegedly providing an alibi to his uncle Lilu Miah, who is accused of killing Sumon Miah, right, in a plot said to have been hatched by a mother, Gedu Bibi . Bibi got her teenage daughter to tell police she had hit the victim in self defence after he turned up with a knife. Her 12 year-old son Fhalak also backed up the story. Detectives shut down their investigation in 2008 but fresh information emerged two years later which led to Bibi and her former lover, 48-year-old cafe owner Lilu Miah, being charged with murder. After a trial at the Old Bailey, jurors cleared Bibi of murder but convicted her of manslaughter and perverting the course of justice. Lilu Miah was cleared of both murder and manslaughter. Bibi, who claimed she was asleep at the time of the attack, had suggested that her husband Angur Miah was involved. Judge Gerald Gordon said he would sentence Bibi at a later date when her counsel is available. The court heard Sumon Miah and Shuhina started a relationship after meeting at the hospital where he worked as a porter while she visited a friend. Just days before the attack, Lilu Miah had shown Bibi four lewd photos of her daughter he had discovered on the internet. On October 8, 2006, he was invited into Bibi’s family home in Priory Court, Walthamstow on October 8, 2006. The Scales of Justice: The trial is being held at the Old Bailey, which features the famous statue on its roof . After being knocked out with the table leg, the weapon was immediately wiped clean and then thrust into the hands of Shuhina to ensure it held her fingerprints. No blood or hairs were found on the weapon, and only her prints were found on the knife she claimed Miah had threatened her with. Following Sumon’s death, a friend handed his camera phone to the police - with the same pictures still saved in its memory. ‘It seems likely that these photographs were the trigger for the show-down that took place that day,’ said Mr Aylett. Lilu Miah admitted his guilt to close friend Monor Uddin, but it was not until Miah was behind bars that he gave an account to police. ‘He said he had done this murder by himself,’ he told jurors. ‘He did it. As soon as the boy came in the door they push him in the sofa. Lilu was sitting in the kitchen with a stock. ‘Lilu came out and banged his head just once. The boy collapsed. The stick was given to Shahina.’ During the trial, it emerged Lilu Miah’s teenage daughter had told police her father had ‘got away with murder’ - but officers ignored the information because the file had been closed. Bibi concocted a story that allowed her and the killer or killers to cheat justice for years, said prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC. ‘If that was intended to hoodwink the police into an entirely false position, it worked,’ he said. ‘Years went by without any charges being brought. But, in time, the case came to be reviewed.’ When Bibi was finally arrested, she claimed she was asleep when the killing took place, while Lilu Miah claimed he had been working at his cafe. She was overheard by a police officer fluent in her Bengali dialect muttering: ‘One bastard died, and we have to go through this.’ While being photographed in the police station, she added: ‘It’s good the b*****d died.’ Even more damning evidence came when a recording from a 999 call made seconds after the attack was re-examined. Talking to a police operator, Fhalak claimed Sumon Miah was outside the house trying to get in. But, listening carefully, an expert in phonetics heard a man groaning in pain in the background - revealing he had already been hit. In the same tape, Bibi is heard ordering Lilu Miah to flee: ‘Go now, get out of this house - through the garden.’ Bibi, of Forest Gate, east London, and Lilu Miah, of no fixed address, both denied murder. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Gedu Bibi 'persuaded former lover to blugeon Sumon Miah to death with a table leg .

Charla Nash, the woman who lost her eyesight, lips, nose, and hands in a vicious attack by a raging chimpanzee is now suing the state of Connecticut. In the allegations, she claims the then-mayor of Stamford, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, knew the animal was dangerous. In addition to the $50million lawsuit against Herold’s estate, Ms Nash also has a request before the state's claims commissioner for permission to pursue a $150million lawsuit against the state for allegedly failing to protect the public, including herself, from a dangerous animal. Before and after: Pictured before the attack, left, and after she received a full-face transplant, right; Ms Nash is suing the state of Connecticut for $150million and claims the Stamford governor knew of the danger . In an interview with The Hartford Courant, Ms Nash said the chimpanzee got loose and roamed Stamford in 2003. She said Malloy knew the chimp's owner, Sandra Herold, and allowed her to take him home and warned that he should be locked up. She was attacked by the animal in February 2009. She told the Courant: 'I know he was the mayor when Travis was running loose that time in 2003. (Herold) knew him. And she said he allowed her to take Travis home and said (to) keep him locked up,' she said. 'I think it was said that if he got loose again, they were going to shoot him. That's what Sandra told me.' Malloy's senior adviser, Roy . Occhiogrosso, said last week that the governor may have met and spoken . with Herold when she attended one or more of his periodic meetings with . the public. But he said it was 'never about the chimp' and not about the incident Ms Nash mentioned. Ms Nash's lawyers say state . environmental officials received reports and complaints about the danger . and that the state was required by law to remove Travis, but did . nothing. She said the chimpanzee was 'a known danger' in a residential area. Recovery: Six months in, Ms Nash showed off her face transplant surgery. Surgeons spent 20 hours re-building her features . Reconstruction: In the attack, her eyes, nose, and lips were mauled off . 'With a dog, you've got to keep him on a leash,' she said. 'Animals have to have rabies shots. How come he was excluded?' A spokesman for the state environmental agency would not comment because Ms Nash's case is before the state claims commission. If her request to sue the state is . denied by the Claims Commission, she can appeal to the legislature. Nash's lawyers have hired a lobbyist to represent her if necessary at . the state Capitol. The state has 'sovereign immunity' against most lawsuits unless such permission is granted. Despite her legal woes, the face transplant recipient says she feels at home in her new skin. 'I have to depend on a lot of help. My life depends on really not being alone. I used to be very independent.' -Charla Nash . The brave 58-year-old woman, who nearly died in the horrific mauling, told the Hartford Courant exclusively last week that she feels no different than she did before the attack. ‘I just feel like it’s my face,’ she said. ‘It’s just not working real good.’ Ms Nash, a single mother from . Stamford, Connecticut, told the Courant that she’s regaining movements . in her face and can express herself with various motions. ‘Every day, my muscles get better,’ she said. Sandra . Herold, who owned the 200-lb chimp Travis, died of an aneurism in 2010. Ms Nash said that if she could say anything to her former boss and . friend, she would say she is ‘sorry that all this happened. And, nothing . we can change now.’ On a rampage: Travis escaped in 2003 and roamed around Stamford, Connecticut before he was eventually re-captured . However, . she added that Herold was ‘a trouble person’ that was more worried . about her pet – who was shot and killed after the attack – than she was . of her. In past interviews, . Ms Nash revealed that having a new face allowed her simple human . pleasures – she has regained her sense of smell and can eat again. Furious George: She was attacked by 200-lb chimpanzee Travis in 2009 . She is even regaining sensation in her forehead, cheeks, eyebrow, and nose. But most of all, she’s learning how to smile. ‘It creases up here,’ Ms Nash told the Courant as she pointed at her mouth. In the interview, Ms Nash also spoke of long years of rehabilitation, and the hope of regaining some semblance of independence. ‘I don’t know what the future’s doing (sic) to bring… so I don’t get my hopes up,’ Ms Nash said, . though she added that she wants to progress far enough that she can again ride horses and live in her own house. She said she misses simple things – like being able to bargain hunt, bask in the sunshine, or even look at her 20-year-old daughter, Brianna. ‘I have to depend on a lot of help,’ she said. ‘My life depends on really not being alone. I used to be very independent.’ She also gets phantom pains in her hands, despite the fact that they were removed after the 2009 attack. Transplants added in surgery later had to be removed because of dangerous complications. In an interview with ABC 7 last month, Ms Nash – who likes being called Charlie – said she doesn’t want anybody’s pity. ‘I don’t want anyone to feel sorry for me,’ she said. ‘I want to be like everyone else.’ She has been told by doctors that she needs to work on bulking up, as she is still quite thin for her 5ft 10in frame. Courageous: The survivor first revealed her mauled face on the Oprah Winfrey show; before the surgery, she kept a veil over her face . Haunting image: Ms Nash is seen posing with the chimp a year before the attack . Ms Nash, who was blinded in the 2009 attack, was fitted with brown glass eyes and hopes to get a double hand transplant after the first one failed. She received a revolutionary full-face transplant at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston nearly two years after the attack. The operation – performed by a team of more than 30 surgeons and nurses – and subsequent recovery were widely covered. Prior to the surgery, she hid her face under a veil, saying that she chose to wear it ‘so I don’t scare people.’","Charla Nash, 58, horrifically mauled by chimpanzee in 2009 .

An epic, multimillion-dollar divorce case which dealt with allegations of everything from infidelity to bugging to drug use has finally come to a close after a whopping five years. Ex-Yahoo boss Susan Decker, 49, and husband Michael Dovey, 52, reached a settlement Monday in the California case involving some $71million in real estate, stock, cash and other assets. Marin County Superior Court Judge Verna Adams approved the settlement presented by the former couple's attorneys Monday morning, just before a trial in the case was set to begin. Happier times: Michael Covey, left, and Susan Decker appear together in this photo taken in 2007 - the same year the couple filed for divorce . Decker and Dovey met at Harvard Business School and married in 1992. They have three children. They filed for divorce in 2007 - the same year Decker was promoted to president of Yahoo - after about 15 years of marriage. She resigned in 2009 following a tumultuous period for the company. Also that year, a confidential letter from Dovey's attorneys to Decker's became public alleging she had extramarital affairs, bugged the couple's condo in Laguna Beach to spy on her husband and used illegal drugs. Embattled: Decker resigned as president of Yahoo in 2009 following a tumultuous period for the company, and two years after the divorce filing . House wars: Among the $71million in assets was this $5million home in Belvedere, California, that the couple once shared . Decker's lawyers called those claims reckless and inaccurate. Dovey's attorneys claimed Decker had similarly accused him of infidelity and drug use. Allegations: Decker was accused by her husband of having affairs and bugging the couple's condo to spy on him . In a joint statement to the San Jose Mercury News, Decker and Dovey said: ""As in any acrimonious divorce, certain statements were made by the parties in the process of litigation that were reckless and inaccurate. We deeply regret this'. The statement went on: 'We have three amazing children and we share the important task of raising them responsibly and lovingly. For their sake, we want to put this matter to rest once and for all and have settled all matters in this case'. The properties involved in the divorce negotiations included the family's five-bedroom home in Belvedere, a wealthy Marin County enclave along San Francisco Bay. The former couple also owned the $6million Laguna Beach condo, two Lake Tahoe condos worth a combined $2million and a $1million parcel of land in Napa. None of the properties carried mortgages. Dovey had earned up to $1.5million as an investment banker at Montgomery Securities but stopped working in his 30s, according to court filings. He had about $13million in savings when he left his job. During the protracted court battle, Dovey's attorneys issued multiple subpoenas to officials at Yahoo demanding emails and records. Yahoo's head of corporate security was among the witnesses scheduled to testify.","Divorce between Susan Decker and Michael Covey involved about $71million in real estate, stock, cash and other assets .

Tragedy: Fiona Geraghty, 14, hanged herself because she had been bullied over her weight an inquest was told . A girl of 14 hanged herself  after being taunted about  her weight at her prestigious  private school, an inquest was told yesterday. Fiona Geraghty, who was nicknamed ‘yo-yo’ because of her  bouncy personality, developed bulimia after being called ‘fat’ by a  group of playground bullies. Although the teenager had been  popular at her previous school, she  failed to settle in after moving to  £15,000-a-year King’s College in Taunton, Somerset, a coroner heard. Yesterday Fiona’s mother, Dr Elspeth Geraghty, a GP, said she felt let  down by the school and psychiatric experts who saw Fiona four times before discharging her. She also revealed her daughter had written an essay referring to her health problems and ‘self-loathing’ in the term before her death – but that the school had failed to pass it on to her family. Dr Geraghty told the inquest: ‘I am disappointed the college failed to apply its own learning to its behaviour. ‘There was no real concern or significance placed on the events in that term. I also feel let down by the mental health services. Eating disorders such as this suffered by Fiona are the result of an underlying psychiatric problem. ‘Being seen on four occasions before being discharged seems a wholly  inappropriate response.’ Dr Geraghty also claimed her daughter had begun vomiting ‘following taunts from other girls about her size’. ‘She did have some relationship  problems within her peer group,’ she added. ‘I became aware Fiona had a serious eating disorder when I was contacted by her housemasters in February 2011. They said she had been vomiting.’ The teenager was taken to see Ross Gillanders, a community psychiatric nurse with the Somerset NHS Trust. He believed she had an unspecified eating disorder, but claimed her binges were more the result of hunger. He saw Fiona four times, between  April 12 and May 5 last year, before  discharging her from his care. Mr Gillanders told the inquest: ‘I thought she was not seriously unwell. There are cases where you can be blindsided. Her problems at school were resolved, her weight was improving and she had plans for the future.’ The inquest also heard that her  parents had recently confiscated her laptop after she wrote on Facebook about her father’s confidential work as a hospital consultant. Loved: Fiona was described by an aunt as a 'beautiful, sunny child who had everything going for her' Help: Fiona saw a community psychiatric nurse on four occasions before she was discharged just two weeks before she committed suicide, the Taunton hearing was told . She had also uploaded her cousin’s . passport photo, forcing the relative to get new travel documents and . delay their travel plans. Two months after being discharged, on . July 14 last year, her father, Dr John Geraghty, found Fiona’s body at . their home in Nailsbourne, Somerset. A letter was taken from the scene by police officers and pathologist John Oxley later gave the cause of death  as hanging. According to toxicology reports there were no traces of alcohol of drugs in her system. Two months later, her parents discovered a diary in which Fiona had revealed the full extent of her eating disorder. Mr Gillanders told West Somerset Coroner Michael Rose that had he seen the diary, he would have concluded she had bulimia. School: The inquest heard that the Fiona had been very popular at her . previous school but had been targeted by a group of her peers at the . £15,000 a year King's College in Taunton . However, Bryan Lask, professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at the University of London, criticised Somerset Partnership NHS Trust. ‘I don’t know how the full clinical picture could have been evident in just four sessions,’ he said. ‘There was insufficient information about what was happening in her life. The parents should have been  much more involved throughout the process. Any child who induces vomiting is in a very troubled state.’ Paying tribute to Fiona, her aunt Fiona Symondson said: ‘She was  very bubbly and always had a smile on her face. Fiona was a very beautiful, sunny child who had everything  going for her. ‘Everybody has a smile on their face now when they think of her.’ The hearing in Taunton is expected to end today.

Princess Anne’s former husband, Captain Mark Phillips, is to divorce for the second time after a year-long romance with a woman 30 years his junior. The 63-year-old – who is father to the Queen’s grandchildren Peter and Zara Phillips – has left his wife Sandy for American equestrienne Lauren Hough, it emerged last night. It is understood Captain Phillips has already left the marital home in Cherington, Gloucestershire, and plans to set up home with Miss Hough, 35, in Florida. Proud father: Capt. Phillips with Zara, left, and Olympian Lauren Hough, right . Sources close to the captain told the . Daily Telegraph that he broke the news to his 58-year-old wife and . their 14-year-old daughter Stephanie earlier this year. He has reportedly told friends that ‘I might only be alive for another five or ten years so I might as well be happy’. The . couple’s separation and forthcoming divorce have been confirmed in a . statement from Captain Phillips’s solicitors at the law firm CKFT. Moving out: Princess Anne's ex-husband Capt Mark Phillips has left his . wife Sandy (pictured left standing next to Mr Phillips) for US horse . rider Lauren Hough (right) It said: ‘Captain and Mrs Mark Phillips are separating and divorce proceedings have commenced. The couple have a daughter, aged 14, and the care and support of her is Captain Phillips’s main concern at this sensitive time. It is not clear whether the romance . was responsible for the breakdown of his marriage, but friends of Miss . Hough claim the couple have been openly living together at her home in . Florida for the past few months. Two weddings: Mark Phillips with daughter Zara at her wedding to Mike Tindall last year (left) and leaving Westminster Abbey (right) with Arincess Anne after their wedding ceremony in 1973 . Lauren Hough (second fromt he left) celebrates with her US teammates (L-R) Mclain Ward, Laura Kraut and Jeffery Welles after wining the final of the Samsung Super league at the Real Club de Polo in Barcelona, in September 2005 . ‘He therefore requests that all parties respect their privacy in the months ahead.’ Captain Phillips, an Olympic gold . medallist in three-day eventing, met Miss Hough through his work as . trainer of the US eventing team. He lives in America for several months . of the year. She bears an uncanny resemblance to . his second wife when she was younger and shares his passion for horses – . a love he has passed down to his daughter, Zara, who has hopes of . making this summer’s British Olympics eventing team. Captain Phillips has even met his new . partner’s parents, Charles ‘Champ’ Hough, 70, and his 68-year-old wife . Linda, several times. Since leaving the military Mark Phillips, pictured competing at the Badminton Horse Trials in 1976, has spent his life in the world of equestrianism - so it is little wonder that it is through his love of horses that he met the women in his life. In 1972, at the age of 23, Captain Phillips was a member of the British three-day event team that won the gold medal at the Munich Olympics. It was at the Games that he met Princess Anne. The couple got engaged the following year. As well as Olympics success, Captain Phillips won the Badminton Horse Trials in 1971 and 1972 riding Great Ovation, in 1974 on Colombus, and in 1981 on Lincoln. After he retired from the Army, he continued to style himself Captain Mark Phillips - which was allowed as junior cavalry officers whose civilian work involves equestrianism may continue to use their rank. By 1990, with his marriage on the rocks, Captain Phillips was in a relationship with Hawaiian-born Sandy Pflueger, who had been part of the US dressage team at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. The couple married in 1997. And now, as he confirms his divorce from his second wife, it emerges that the new woman in his life is Lauren Hough - who represented the US int he 2000 Olympics and still works with the US eventing team, which Captain Phillips also helps train. They are said to have found him immensely likeable – which is not entirely surprising, as they are clearly far closer to him in age. A relative of Miss Hough, who did not want to be named, said yesterday: ‘Champ and Linda are quite old fashioned and, I suspect, would not have approved of their daughter seeing a married man. But I know they have met Mark many times when in Florida and do like him. ‘Other people in the family knew she was seeing Mark and of course everyone was aware of who he was and his royal connections.’ Another friend added: ‘It was pretty much well known among the equestrian community there that Mark and Lauren were an item. They did not really try to hide it in the last couple of months, but were still very careful not to be seen to be photographed together or holding hands. They were always very discreet.’ Miss Hough’s £300,000 home is situated on the exclusive Palm Beach Polo and Hunt Club, a sprawling development of gated communities in Wellington, Florida that boasts its own equestrian facilities as well as an 18-hole golf course. Rene Chambers, a former neighbour, said she would often see Capt Phillips’s silver Range Rover parked in the driveway of the three bedroom home – even though he would ostensibly stay in a rented house on the same development while working in Wellington, known as the equestrian capital of the US. ‘He was always very friendly and we loved his accent. I had no idea he was from the Royal Family. 'We just thought he was part of the horsey set that live all around here. 'That is neat to know that he was related to the Queen,’ she said. Miss Hough sold her home in March this year and the couple are now said to be looking for a property in the area to buy together. There was no sign of Mrs Phillips yesterday at the family farm in Cherington, near Tetbury, Gloucestershire, and a member of staff said she did not wish to comment. Captain Phillips was divorced by Princess Anne in 1992 after it was confirmed he had fathered a child outside of the marriage. He married Hawaiian-born Sandy Pflueger in 1997. She was part of the US dressage team at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics and went on to help coach the US team alongside her husband. When they married, she became stepmother to Zara and Peter. Last year she joined her husband for Zara’s wedding in Edinburgh. Miss . Hough was part of the US team at the Sydney Olympics in 2000, and will . also be helping coach the current US team alongside Captain Phillips at . the London 2012 Games . According . to sources, the pair recently told members of the US eventing team . about their relationship to ‘get it out in the open’. Sources close to Miss Hough said the couple were house-hunting together in Florida. On her personal website she lists as hobbies cooking, reading, working out in the gym and ‘hanging out with her dog, April’. Captain . Phillips also met Princess Anne through horses. She rode for Britain in . the 1976 Olympics in Montreal, four years after he won a gold medal at . the 1972 Munich Olympics. They married in 1973. In 1984, however, he fathered a love child, Felicity, with art teacher Heather Tonkin after a one-night stand in New Zealand. He has never publicly acknowledged his daughter. The pair met through their work with the U.S. eventing team ahead of this summer's Olympics .

House prices have seen their biggest annual increase since December 2010 in a sign the market was standing firm in the double-dip recession, figures have revealed. Values rose 1.4 per cent in the year to April making the average price £229,000, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). That would have added nearly £3,000 to the cost of the average home. But the North-South divide was in full evidence again after the cost of a property jumped nearly 5 per cent in London, while there were declines in the North West, and Yorkshire and Humber. Defiant: House prices have risen 1.4% in the year to April, the biggest annual rise since December 2010, according to figures by the Office for National Statistics . On a seasonally adjusted basis, UK house prices were up by 1.1 per cent between March and April, reversing a decline the previous month. The figures come after property website Rightmove revealed property asking prices had hit another record high of £246,235, a one per cent rise from April. That pushed the website's index of newly-listed asking prices 2 per cent higher than they stood in August 2007, the month before the Northern Rock bank run signalled that the financial crisis had arrived in Britain. Stuart Law, chief executive of property investment firm Assetz, said the figures showed the housing was resilient amid the economic slump. Streets ahead: London house prices massively outstrip those elsewhere, the ONS figures show. They also saw rises of 5% compared to falls in the North . New vs old: How house price rises and falls compare between new build and second hand homes . 'These latest findings fly in the face . of reports that the UK property market is headed for a double dip,' he . told the Daily Express. 'Increased . levels of lending in May will help buoy the market with this likely to . be sustained following the Bank of England's £100billion injection into . the banking system.' The rises in the south were also driven by more modest gains in the South East and South West. This was offset by falls in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland of 1.1 per cent, 0.3 per cent and 8.1 per cent respectively, while the largest decreases in England were 1.3 per cent in the North West and Yorkshire and Humber, the ONS said in its monthly house price index. Bouncing back: Asking prices have steadily risen this year, despite the economic gloom deepening . Average house prices in April stood at £237,000 in England, £151,000 in Wales, £129,000 in Northern Ireland and £178,000 in Scotland. London's average price of £388,000 contrasts with the North East, which has England's lowest average price at £145,000. The ONS added that the average price of new dwellings rose by 5.1 per cent during the year to April, while the figure for pre-owned homes increased by 1.1 per cent. The end of a stamp duty holiday for first-time buyers in March meant the proportion of homes bought by this section of the market fell back to 32 per cent in April from 43 per cent the previous month. The prices paid by first-time buyers were 1.5 per cent higher on average than in April last year.","£2,280 added to home values since April last year .

Accusations: Gary Barlow faced a backlash today over allegations he invested in a scheme allegedly designed to avoid paying tax . Gary Barlow faced a backlash last night after it emerged he and two Take That bandmates invested £26million in a scheme allegedly designed to avoid paying tax. Barlow, Howard Donald, Mark Owen and their manager, Jonathan Wild, face suggestions they avoided paying their fair share of income tax. They are among 1,000 people who contributed £480million to 62 partnerships in music industry investment schemes that act as tax shelters for super-rich individuals. The revelations have prompted MPs to question the decision to honour Barlow with an OBE this month. Revenue officials will attempt to shut down the partnerships, run by a company called Icebreaker Management Services, at a tribunal in November. A spokesman for Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs said: 'We do not accept that the Icebreaker tax schemes have the tax effects their promoters claim.' He said one Icebreaker scheme had already been successfully challenged. Labour MP Stephen Pound criticised Barlow yesterday, saying: 'It's less Take That and more like Take That And All The Rest. Gary Barlow needs to do his patriotic duty and show he is not a part-time patriot off-shoring his wealth through this shelter while keeping his OBE on-shore.' Simon Hughes, the Lib Dem deputy leader, said he was 'on the warpath' over people who did not pay full tax. He said: 'Honours are meant to be for people who serve Britain and are good citizens in doing so. If you don't pay your taxes you're not a fully decent citizen. 'In the future, the honours committee – because these things are all scrutinised – should make sure that people are clean as far as their tax affairs are concerned as well as having done good public service for Britain and its exports.' Mr Hughes added: 'I think we'll hear a lot more of this in the weeks ahead. I'm certainly one of those on the warpath and I'm not going to be diverted. It is completely unacceptable. 'We've had billions of pounds unpaid every year by people like the comedians and the singers we're talking about – that's got to end.' 'Seeking haven': Fellow Take That stars Mark Owen (left) and Howard Donald (right) are also said to have invested in the scheme, which HM Revenue & Customs is attempting to shut down . Lawyers representing Barlow, Donald, . Owen and Mr Wild confirmed their clients were investors in two . Icebreaker partnerships, but believed they were legitimate enterprises. Icebreaker denies that its partnerships were designed to avoid tax. There is no suggestion that the scheme is illegal. Lib Dem MP Greg Mulholland, a member of the Public Administration Select committee, said: ‘It is wrong for those held up as models of service and duty to be given or indeed to accept honours despite having deliberately avoided the payment of tax. Jimmy Carr has broken his silence over claims that he dodged tax, insisting: 'I pay what I have to and not a penny more' 'Those who are happy to be honoured by their country should also be happy to pay taxes to their country. Not doing so is not acceptable and unpatriotic.’ He added that those honoured by the nation ‘should be happy to make their contribution to national life in every sense’.’ Stephen Williams, the Lib Dems’ co-chair of their Treasury policy committee, added: ‘I don’t think our system should honour individuals who don’t pay their way.’ A typical Icebreaker partnership collects around £10million from about a dozen investors and uses the funds to buy music rights in upcoming and established artists. Investors get tax relief on any money they invest in the scheme. However, they are able to wipe out more tax than they actually pay because any investment they make out of their own cash can be bumped up by taking a loan arranged by Icebreaker from an offshore bank and also investing this in the scheme. For example, someone who makes a minimum investment of £40,000 of their own money into an Icebreaker partnership, could boost the amount they put in by taking an offshore loan for £160,000. They would get tax relief on the full amount they paid in - wiping £77,250 off their bill. A person who invests £200,000 in cash can earn £1million tax free. If the tax relief they get is greater than their annual income then it can be used by a wealthy investor against other income they have paid tax on during the previous three years. Icebreaker denied that its partnerships were designed to avoid tax. It said they were intended to invest money in the music industry for profit by producing ‘creative and artistic material and [creating] taxable profits’ Companies House records show that the three Take That members and their manager joined two Icebreaker partnerships in March 2010 and September 2011. In the first, they put in £5.2million of their own cash and borrowed another £20.8million. The partnership registered a loss in the year to April 2010 of £25.2million, which accounts show as ‘available for discretionary division among members’. Lawyers representing Barlow, Donald, Owen and Mr Wild said the men had paid significant amounts of tax. They confirmed that their clients were investors in the two partnerships, but believed they were legitimate enterprises and not tax-avoidance schemes. There is no suggestion that other members of Take That were investors - and it is not known whether those that did were aware of the tax benefits when they invested in the partnerships. There is no suggestion that the scheme is illegal. A typical Icebreaker partnership . collects around £10million from about a dozen investors and uses the . funds to buy music rights in upcoming and established artists. Icebreaker . can help investors to save more in tax than they put into the scheme . with losses being offset by a wealthy investor against other income . earned during the previous three years. Investors can bump up this tax relief by taking out offshore loans arranged by Icebreaker. For . a minimum investment of £40,000 into an Icebreaker partnership, boosted . by an offshore loan of £160,000, a member can generate £77,520 of tax . relief. A person who invests £200,000 in cash can earn £1million tax free.","Faces allegations together with band-mates Howard Donald and Mark Owen and their manager Jonathan Wild .

On the up: The Queen's income will receive a boost next year after record profits from her lucrative Crown Estate property empire . The Queen’s income will receive a boost next year after record profits from her lucrative Crown Estate property empire. Controversial changes made last year tying Royal Family funding to Crown Estate profits means the Queen and royal household will be entitled to a 16 per cent hike in their official duties grant - to £36million from next April, up from £31million this year. The rise follows the Government’s move last year to scrap the Civil List and link funding for the royals to profits from the Crown Estate, as part of a new sovereign grant. The royal household is entitled to 15 per cent of profits from the Crown Estate - which belongs to the nation and includes a host of historic properties, such as Regent Street in the West End of London, Windsor Park, Royal Ascot and most of Britain’s coastline. Figures for the Crown Estate reveal the portfolio enjoyed the best performance in its history, with profits rising to £240million in the year to March 31 from £231million the year before. Previously, all profits from the Crown Estate went to the Treasury and the taxpayer - a historic arrangement dating back to 1760. Over the last ten years, the portfolio has contributed £2billion to the Treasury. Campaign group Republic said it was 'disgraceful' that 15 per cent of Crown estate profits went to the royal household. Graham Smith, chief executive of Republic, said: 'This is more evidence that the whole funding arrangement needs to be reformed and put on a proper footing.' He added: 'The Crown Estate doesn’t belong to the Queen, it belongs to the country.' A . Treasury spokesman said it was up to the royal household to spend the . grant 'prudently' and stressed any money not spent would go towards a . reserve to cope with unexpected costs and dips in revenue. While there is no cap on cash received . from Crown Estate profits, the Treasury has set a cap to ensure the . reserve does not exceed half the sovereign grant in that year. Premium address: The royal household is entitled to 15 per cent of profits from the Crown Estate - which belongs to the nation and includes historic properties such as Regent Street in the West End of London . Tintern Abbey in Wales is also part of the Crown Estate. Over the last ten years, the portfolio has contributed £2billion to the Treasury . A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: 'The Royal Household is absolutely committed to ensuring value for money for the taxpayer, having already reduced expenditure by a fifth over five years. 'The sovereign grant is a simpler, more transparent way of funding the monarchy and is, of course, now open to scrutiny by the National Audit Office.' Figures on royal household spending are due out on July 2. It is thought some of the income from the sovereign grant will be used to clear a backlog of repairs to the Royal palaces, thought to total more than £32million. The Crown Estate’s annual results showed its capital value passed the £8billion milestone for the first time, up 11 per cent in the year. Total return last year was 16.8 per cent, far higher than the industry benchmark of 10.4 per cent, and the value of its properties was £7.6billion after a 7.4 per cent hike in the past year.","Controversial changes made last year tying Royal Family funding to Crown Estate profits .

'No remorse': Leroy Brown blackmailed Steven Aldridge and went on to target his victim's family in arson attacks . An arsonist has been jailed for blackmailing a wealthy property developer and torching two desirable London mews houses in a 'relentless' campaign aimed at his victim's family and business. Leroy Brown didn't know Steven Aldridge but he made his life a misery for more than two years, setting fire to properties the businessman had developed before moving on to target the homes of his parents and sister. But he was put behind bars indefinitely today after a jury at Maidstone Crown Court found him guilty of blackmail and arson. A judge ordered that Brown, 34, of Hanwell, west London, should serve at least eight-and-a-half years before becoming eligible for parole. Police believe that, from 2009, Brown and unknown accomplices bombarded Mr Aldridge with menacing phone calls and distributed threatening letters demanding cash payments of up to £56,000 at a time. At the time Mr Aldridge was a successful property developer living in south-west London. Brown's campaign escalated in April 2010 when he resorted to arson attacks, torching two mews houses that Mr Aldridge had developed in South Kensington in London. The arsonist struck again in May 2011, first starting a fire at what he thought was the victims' parents home in Rainham, Kent. But he got the wrong address and instead attacked the home of an innocent neighbour, damaging the front of the house and a car parked outside. Ten days later, Brown torched the home of Mr Aldridge's sister and caused damage to her car. Mr Aldridge reported the matter to detectives and Brown was arrested by the Metropolitan Police on suspicion of blackmail on June 29 last year. But he was later bailed, and went on to set fire to Mr Aldridge's parents' home and send the businessman another threatening letter. On July 26 last year, Brown was arrested by officers from the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate. Sentenced: Brown was jailed indefinitely by a judge at Maidstone Crown Court (pictured) He denied any involvement with Mr Aldridge, but was found guilty of blackmail and five counts of arson being reckless as to whether life is endangered. Dc Wayne Totterdell, from the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate said: 'This was a relentless and prolonged attempt to blackmail a businessman using an escalating series of threats and acts against the victim, his family, and their property.' 'Brown, who was unknown to the victim, was prepared to go to great lengths in order to obtain a large sum of money from him. 'Having initially failed to achieve this through threats, harassment, and acts of damage, he went on to commit a series of arson attacks culminating in the targeting of the victim’s extended family in Kent. 'These actions clearly demonstrated that Brown was willing put the lives of the victim, his family, and members of the public at risk in pursuit of securing financial gain. 'Following the arson attacks in Kent, we acted swiftly to arrest Brown, secure evidence, and end the ordeal that he had put the victim and his family through.' The detective added that Brown had shown 'no remorse'. 'The offence of Blackmail is a psychological crime aimed at intimidating victims into co-operating with the demands being made,' he said.","Leroy Brown 34, of west London, bombarded businessman Steven Aldridge with threatening calls and letters, demanding payments of up to £56,000 .

A lake is being drained in the latest effort to find cousins Elizabeth Collins and Lyric Cook-Morrissey - who have been missing since Friday - after a search dog picked up their scent in the area. Elizabeth, 8, and Lyric, 10, were last seen riding their bicycles in downtown Evansdale on Friday. Hundreds of volunteers spent the weekend looking for the girls, whose bikes were found next to Meyers Lake on Friday afternoon, but so far both police and volunteers have no significant leads. Scroll down for video . Missing: Eight-year-old Elizabeth Collins, left, and 10-year-old Lyric Cook disappeared while riding their bikes not far from Elizabeth's home in Evansdale, Iowa . Desperate search: Authorities look for possible evidence at Meyers Lake where Lyric Cook-Morrissey, 10, and Elizabeth Collins, 8, disappeared last Friday . More than 350 . volunteers joined the search over the weekend. Teams have been dragging the lake for the past two days but have found nothing. A spokesman from Black Hawk County Sheriff's Office said it would take another two days at least for the lake to be fully drained. FBI spokeswoman Sandy Breault said . the reaction from the dogs on Monday night indicated a 'strong . possibility' the girls had been at the lake, less than a mile from their . grandmother's house where they were last seen on Friday. However, Breault said because there were no confirmed sightings at the lake, authorities could not be certain. Close: The girls, pictured in 2009, often spent the day together when Lyric's mother was at work . Chief Deputy Rick Abben of the Black . Hawk County Sheriff's Office said the case was still considered a . missing persons investigation. The decision to drain the lake was made to rule out the possibility the girls were in the water, he said. Breault said the search has been slowed because of the time required to drain the lake. The draining began Monday afternoon and could take up to three days. A father's agony: Dan Morrissey leans on a tree near Meyers Lake where his daughter Lyric and her cousin Elizabeth Collins disappeared . But local officials said the draining . likely will go faster because of the already low level of the lake and . the Cedar River into which it drains. The lake is draining through a 3-foot . culvert with a grate over it that would prevent a body from flowing . into it, Abben said. A pump was brought in on Tuesday to quicken the . pace. Officers slowly paddled around the lake in kayaks on Tuesday morning. Collecting evidence: Law enforcement officials and search volunteers have focused on Meyers Lake in search of the girls . A group of three officers walking along the southeast shoreline stopped to study something that appeared to be a cup. An officer with gloves and an evidence bag picked it up and took it back to a patrol car sitting along the bank. Officials didn't . identify the object or even confirm whether it was related to the search . for the girls but it was a . rare sign of activity in a massive search that has produced few if any . significant leads. Dan Morrissey, Lyric's father, told the Associated Press: 'I don't think that they're . in the lake, not at all but it is just like a dead end as far as we know . so far.' He added: 'We've never gone through . anything like this. It's hard enough just to get up and deal with the . reality that your daughter is gone.' Family members were still hopeful . that the girls would be found safe, despite investigators admitting that . had no new clues as to their whereabouts. Chief Deputy Abben said authorities were interviewing family and friends of the girls in hopes that they might shed some light on the girls' behaviour and state of mind before their disappearance. Tammy Brousseau, 48, an aunt to both of the girls, said all the signs were pointing to a stranger - possibility a pedophile - who may have abducted them from the area where the bikes were found. Brousseau said that just last week she taught Lyric how to 'save someone if they went limp in the water.' She said she also taught both girls how to 'drop to the ground and fight' if someone tried to abduct them. Mom and dad: Lyric's parents Misty and Dan Morrissey say they don't suspect a drowning, noting the girls' swimming abilities and the fact that no shoes were recovered on the bank of the lake . Lyric's parents said they didn't suspect a drowning either, noting the girls' swimming abilities and the fact that no shoes were recovered on the bank of the lake. Dan Morrissey said: 'The area where the bikes were found is fenced on both sides, and it is right where [a] maintenance gate is. It is a spot that looks to me like a trap. 'Somebody could have just come along right then or followed them down it would have been the worst spot to be in right there.' Search: More than 350 volunteers came Saturday to help search Deerwood Park for the two missing girls . Local support: Volunteer Earl Conerd searches debris around Meyers Lake. But, despite a large turn-out of volunteers, police say they have not found any evidence that would point them to the girls' whereabouts . Registered sex offenders in the are are also being interviewed. The mothers of both girls said they were trying to stay strong as the search dragged on. Misty Cook-Morrissey said: . 'Sometimes, when you think about it, you wonder if they're dead . somewhere, but you try to push those thoughts out of your mind.' Search: This poster was issued to complement rescue efforts by around 400 officials and volunteers . The girls were being looked after by . their grandmother Wilma Cook on Friday when they decided to take a cycle . ride to the nearby lake. Mrs Morrissey alerted authorities when the . girls had not returned home by 3pm. Despite the mystery surrounding their disappearance, police do not believe the girls are victims of a crime. Mr Abben said: 'At this time it's still a missing persons case. There's no indication of foul play.'

Refuse collectors have been banned from pulling wheelie bins up alleys because of fears they may suffer a back injury. In a decision blasted as ‘defying common sense’, hundreds of residents who for decades have been putting their rubbish outside their back doors have been told it is too risky for binmen to collect. Householders – many of them pensioners – must now pull the wheelie bins along narrow alleyways near their homes themselves or risk not having their rubbish collected. Their only alternative is to attempt to trundle the large bins through the inside of their homes to the front. 'Dangerous': Durham Council officials believe binmen collecting bins from back alleys like this in Newton Aycliffe could give them back injuries . Residents in Newton Aycliffe, County . Durham, are infuriated by the health and safety clampdown, which . followed a council risk assessment. Letters were sent to 287 households . to explain that crews could be vulnerable to ‘musculoskeletal injuries’ when pulling wheelie bins. The residents live in terraced houses . with rear gardens that back on to alleyways about as wide as two wheelie . bins and up to 87 yards long. They argue that in the days of steel . bins, crews walked up the alleys to take the dustbins back to the . dustcart in the street – and that the job has now been made even easier . by wheelie bins. However, according to the council, . crews are being forced to adopt ‘awkward postures’ in the confined . space, risking back, joint and limb problems. Tracy Tremewan, 34, who lives in one of eight streets that have been affected, said: ‘I think it’s absolutely shocking. Neighbours Jean White, left, and Tracy Trermewan are just some of those who are unhappy about the health and safety rules implemented by Durham County Council. Right, a binman in the fifties from a simpler era of refuse collection. ‘That’s what they get paid to do – . move the bins. They say they can’t move them but we can. But what . happens if we hurt our backs?’ Neighbour Jean White, 65, who has lived . in her house for nearly 40 years, said: ‘Before the wheelie bins came in . they used to pick the metal ones up on their shoulders. You’d have . thought if they were going to hurt their backs they would have done so . then. ‘The next thing you know we will have to empty the bins into the lorries ourselves.’ It has also been claimed that by . getting residents to do the work of pushing bins, the council will need . to employ fewer binmen. David Stevens, 68, said: ‘The bins are . on wheels and are not heavy for strong binmen. We think that the . council is nit-picking to save money.’ Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said residents had ‘every right to feel short-changed’. ‘Collecting the bins is a basic service which people expect in return for their council tax,’ he added. ‘If binmen have been collecting . rubbish from the same place for decades, how can the sudden change be . seriously justified? 'This is another example of health and safety rules . being interpreted in an extreme way that defies common sense.’ Jimmy Bennett, manager of Streetscene, . which provides the bin collection service, said: ‘By asking residents . to bring their bins to the end of the lane we can provide a more . effective service and keep the lane clear.’ The first collection under the new . rules went ‘smoothly’, he said, adding that special arrangements would . be made for residents who are unable to move their own bins.","Durham County Council concerned binmen will develop 'muscular skeletal injuries' by collecting bins from back alleys .

A secondary school teacher who was imprisoned for biting off his wife’s nose is engaged again - while he serves a five-year prison sentence. Nicholas Gough, 59, was jailed in March after admitting the violent assault on his wife of 24 years Lynne which left her disfigured for life. But Gough, of Wolverhampton, is now planning to tie the knot with divorced grandmother Anne Carr, 54, of Redditch, Worcestershire, when he is released from Featherstone Prison. New found love: Anne Carr, pictured with her engagement ring, is to marry convict Nicholas Gough, right, who she believes that her soon-to-be husband has had a 'hard time' The brute, who taught at Phoenix Collegiate Academy in Wednesbury, West Midlands, for ten years, threatened to kill Lynne, and tried to strangle her following the frenzied attack in a gazebo in their back garden after downing a bottle of wine. The 'possessive' science teacher swore at Lynne, 52, and held her down on the floor, before sinking his teeth into the tip of her nose. After the attack at their home in September 2011 Gough tried to persuade his wife to tell people her injuries were inflicted by their pet dog. Retired local government worker Anne met Gough in February last year through a friend. The smitten pair got engaged on May 11 . during one of Anne’s regular visits to Featherstone Prison - when the . father slipped a diamond ring on to her finger. Victim: Lynne suffered hideous injuries after her husband sunk his teeth into her nose . Speaking about her fiancee, Anne, from Redditch, Worcestershire, said: 'I believe he’s a good man and I’m going to stand by him. 'There are two sides to this story, and I feel Nick’s in prison for something he didn’t commit. 'He pleaded guilty to prevent any more suffering, and he was told if he didn’t plead guilty he would have faced a much longer sentence.' The couple’s first date was in March 2011 - two months after Lynne moved in with another man, claiming her husband had been violent towards her. Anne agreed to step aside when Lynne, whose new partner died suddenly, had a reconciliation with her husband and moved back into the marital home in the summer last year. But arguments escalated between the married pair, culminating in the violent attack last September. When he was jailed for five years, Judge Martin Walsh said the attack had left his wife 'disfigured’ for life.' The couple had been married for 24 years and had three children together - as well as three others between them from previous relationships. Mrs Carr, who plans to tie the knot with Gough when he is released, says the duo hit it off straight away. She added: 'I liked him because he was a family man, he was fun and he had had a tough time. 'He was very open, and he would come and stay at my house. 'Him going to jail has put us under an enormous amount of pressure but I love him. 'I believe he’s a good man and I’m going to stand by him. 'When I went to see him, I put the ring on my finger that I had bought, as he has no access to funds, and took it off for him and he pushed it on my finger. 'We are going to make a home together and hopefully get married around six months after he’s out.'

Jason Kenealy, 32, had been pulled clear of a Vauxhall Corsa by a passerby after it crashed into another vehicle and burst into flames. His best friend Carl Yates, 25, was driving and pleaded guilty to causing Mr Kenealy's death by driving carelessly while under the influence of alcohol two times over the legal limit. Save my mates: Jason Kenealy (right) died from his injuries in the crash but not before he begged his rescuer to save his friends still in the car including driver Carl Yates (left) who was two times over the legal drink driving limit in June last year . Despite suffering fatal injuries, Mr Kenealy told his rescuer Kevin Willis ‘I’m all right mate’ then begged him to go back and help his two unconscious friends who were still in the car. Mr Willis, a 50-year-old truck driver, went back into the burning car twice to pull out the other two men, laying them down on grass just as the car blew up. Mr Kenealy, the front seat passenger of the car, was rushed to hospital but died a short time later from multiple injuries. Other passengers in both vehicles also suffered a range of injuries. Today Mr Yates started his five year and . four month sentence in jail for his 'reckless' driving. He was also banned from . driving for six years at his hearing at Bolton Crown Court. Drink driving: Mr Yates, 25, pleaded guilty to drink driving more than twice the legal limit at the time of the crash . The crash occurred in June last year when Mr Yates was driving Mr Kenealy and Shaun Corran, 22, home following a night out in Bolton, Greater Manchester. None of the men were wearing seatbelts at the time. Mr Yates drove his red Corsa VX into the path of an oncoming Toyota Corolla Verso People Carrier, carrying a family of five from Nottingham. The front passenger side of the Corsa, where Mr Kenealy was sitting, took most of the impact and the car careered into a wall and burst into flames. Mr Willis, from Wigan, had been driving by after a family day out in Manchester and stopped his vehicle as the scene unfold. He ripped the front passenger door off the Corsa to pull out Mr Kenealy and had to go in through the boot of the vehicle to rescue his friends. At the time of the crash Mr Willis said: ‘My wife kept shouting “Kevin, Kevin, the car’s going to blow up”, but I thought I can’t just leave them there. ‘It was horrendous, but I remembered my first aid course. They said if someone is screaming they are not alright, but you know they are alive and breathing, so I knew I had to help the lads in the Corsa because they weren’t moving.’ Mr Corran, a football coach, suffered brain injuries and Mr Yates needed treatment for a broken ankle. A . 41-year-old woman who was a passenger in the Toyota, suffered severe . cuts on her leg, a broken collarbone, and needed part of her bowel . removed. Jailed: Today Mr Yates started his sentence of five years and four months in jail after he was sentenced at Bolton Crown Court (pictured) Her six-year-old son needed hospital treatment for a bruised lung. Her husband, 42, and their older son, 7, and daughter, 10, escaped with minor injuries. Tests showed Yates had 190 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The legal limit is 80 microgrammes. Judge Timothy Clayson told Mr Yates: ‘So many people have had their lives very deeply affected by your conduct that evening. ‘The sentence must be severe but cannot make up for all the terrible consequences suffered by the many victims.’ Sgt Jeff Hollick of Greater Mancherster Police said today: ‘Yates was reckless in several ways on the evening of the collision. ‘He was more than twice over the drink drive limit, and this may have led to him turning across the path of the oncoming vehicle believing he could get through the junction. ‘That he didn’t kill anyone else in the collision is down to two reasons; the actions of the public who dragged Yates, his rear seat passenger, and Jason from the burning Corsa, and the fact that the family in the Toyota were correctly seated and belted. ‘The woman injured was in a critical condition and still needs operations. The effects of this collision remind us that drinking and driving does cause serious and fatal collisions, and that wearing your seat belt and using the correct child seats saves lives.’ In a tribute on behalf of Mr Kenealy’s family, his girlfriend said: ‘Jay was much loved by family and friends with his brilliant sense of humour. ‘He always brought a smile to people’s faces. He will be so sadly missed by all who really knew him - truly one in a million.’ Mr Yates’s girlfriend Sarah Hughes said: ‘Carl and Jay were like brothers and did everything together, we were like a little family. ‘Carl is lost without Jay as we all are.

She said: 'Hayden loves swimming but the idea of putting a swimming costume on was too daunting so we never went. I spent my days on the sofa, reading magazines and eating instead. 'I wanted to be the best mum I could be, but I couldn’t even take him to the fun-fair because I was scared I wouldn’t fit on the rides.' Marie, from Amble in Northumberland, started to gain weight after splitting from Hayden’s father not long after giving birth to her son, now seven. She started comfort eating, tucking into a large bowl of cereal and two slices of buttered toast every day for breakfast. Slimmed down: Marie is now a dress size 14 after losing 7st following gastric surgery. She loves her new shape and how she can now fit into pretty dresses . Lunch was two Cornish pasties with crisps or a large MacDonald’s meal, all washed down with a large fizzy drink. While at dinnertime she would order a large chicken curry with chips, spring rolls and prawn crackers from her local Chinese takeaway. Indulging her sweet tooth, Marie would often snack on crisps and chocolate between meals. As the weight crept on, Marie’s self-confidence ebbed away. 'I used to burst into tears in changing rooms because everything looked terrible on me,' she said. Heath risk: The mother knew she had to do something about her weight after she developed diabetes . And it wasn't just finding clothes to fit her dress size 26 that was a problem. At nearly 20st, her health deteriorated and she was diagnosed with diabetes. 'I started to worry that I would lose limbs because of my diabetes, or that I would contract heart disease. I didn’t want to jeapordise my health, I wanted to be able to run around after my little boy,' she said. So in March this year Marie went under the knife and had gastric surgery, which reduced the size of her stomach by three-quarters and limited how much she can eat. Just six months after the surgery she slimmed down from a size 26 to a size 14 and dropped more than a third of her body weight - losing seven stone. Comfort eater: Marie used to binge on takeaways and pasties but knew she had to change her lifestyle so she could be a more active and healthy mum to her son . She now weighs 12st 7lbs and said she has never felt better. She said: 'I’ve got so much more confidence and self esteem. I’ve got a million times more energy and can be the mum I’ve always wanted to be. 'I now take him swimming and we go on bike rides and for walks on the beach. Best of all I can have proper cuddles with my son now, because he can finally wrap his little arms around me. It’s the best feeling in the world.'","Marie Briggs, 25, dropped from 20st to 13st after gastric surgery .
The mother took action as she was so large so couldn't do activities with her son, aged seven, or even give him a cuddle ."

Ruling: Former Barbados international player Mark McCammon, 33, took legal action against Gillingham FC . A black footballer has won a landmark case after an employment tribunal ruled he was racially victimised at his former club. Former Barbados international player Mark McCammon, 33, took legal action against the Gillingham FC after being dismissed for alleged misconduct last year. His claim for race discrimination - thought to be the first by a . professional footballer - and unfair dismissal was brought against . the League Two side and its chairman Paul Scally. The 6ft 2in striker told a hearing in Ashford, Kent, that he and other black players at the club were treated differently from white players. McCammon said he was ordered to come into the ground amid 'treacherous', snowy driving conditions while some white players were told they were not required. He also said the club tried to 'frustrate him out' by refusing to pay private medical bills to help him regain his fitness following injury. Instead, he claims he was offered the same operation on the NHS rather than privately, a move he described as 'completely out of character' for a Football League club, and that he was fined two weeks' wages when he paid a visit to a private consultant. In contrast, the former Charlton, Swindon, Millwall and Brighton player said, a white team-mate was flown to Dubai for treatment by an eminent physiotherapist at the club's expense. In a letter sent to the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) outlining his grievances, McCammon also claimed he was told not to blog while others were permitted to. McCammon told the tribunal that he had been put 'through hell' at Gillingham and had not been given an answer over why he was treated differently to other players. Dubai-based Gillingham chairman Paul Scally described McCammon's claims as being made 'maliciously and without foundation', adding that the club had not had to deal with an allegation of racism in 18 years. McCammon said that during an injury . spell, he had to stay behind at the club for four hours longer than the . other injured and non-injured players. He claimed this was on the 'strict instructions' of Mr Scally. 'Once the players had all left, I sat there watching mind-numbing daytime TV and Britain's Got Talent,' he said. 'The . process of waiting was designed to inflict maximum levels of . frustration on me and it certainly had that impact. Sitting at the club . instead of progressing with my operation was like watching paint dry.' Defeat: Gillingham owner and chairman Paul Scally - the club said they were 'staggered' by the ruling . The events which led up to McCammon's dismissal were triggered on November 30 2010, when south-east England bore the brunt of heavy snowfall. On that day, McCammon said he and two other black players - Josh Gowling and Curtis Weston - were told to make the four-mile drive from the house they shared to the club's medical rooms. 'One of my housemates had contacted another player who lived about two miles nearer to the club who was also due to attend the medical centre with us on that day,' McCammon's statement said. 'He was a white player who had informed us that the club physiotherapist had told him that he was not required to come in on that day because of the snow. Dismissed: McCammon was paid £2,500 a week and was the club's highest paid player . 'There was a further player we . contacted who was in the same boat, ie he needed to attend the club for . physio on the same day. He lived further down in Kent in Maidstone and . had a longer drive in. 'He . was white and had been informed by the club staff that he also did not . need to come in for the day because of the snowy conditions.' Later, . McCammon said one of them received a text message threatening to dock . them two weeks' wages unless they made it to the stadium by midday. When . he arrived at the club, McCammon said he headed to manager Andy . Hessenthaler's room to confront him about being 'racially intolerant' over the decision to order them in. He claimed that Hessenthaler reacted angrily. 'He lost his temper and flayed the . contents of his table. He pushed the table over, throwing overboard the . computer on it and all its other contents. 'It . was the most aggressive and temperamental physical display of tantrum I . had ever seen. The body poise in his language as he stood up to address . me was a stance that stated: 'How dare you talk to me?' 'I was concerned he was going to attack me and I asked whether he was planning to hit me.' McCammon was subsequently ordered to attend a disciplinary hearing and later received a letter saying he was dismissed. The . forward said that after leaving the club, Gillingham 'were effectively . campaigning covertly against me' by trying to sabotage his career. Strong interest was shown following his departure by 11 clubs but talks with all collapsed, often at a late stage. 'It soon became known that the chairman had been interfering,' McCammon said in his statement. 'My . agent was told by other agents that the job he was doing was an . impossible one as they were aware that GFC were effectively campaigning . covertly against me with the intention of sabotaging my career.' McCammon signed for Gillingham in 2008 on £2,500 a week and was the club's highest paid player. 'It was a phenomenal deal,' he said. 'It was a deal that most players would have taken.' But . he disputed claims that the 'trade-off' for such a generous salary was . that if Gillingham remained in League Two during contract terms, his . salary would be cut by 15 percent. McCammon said: 'There was absolutely no way I would have agreed to that. That wasn't making sense to me.' The . tribunal has heard that a clerical error in McCammon's contract meant . the 15 percent line was accidentally omitted despite being agreed . verbally. Key moment: Terry and QPR's Anton Ferdinand clash during the Barclays Premier League match at Loftus Road . Legal experts estimated Mr McCammon would expect to receive in excess of £40,000 compensation, although the figure could be higher. However, Mr McCammon's barrister today confirmed the tribunal panel had reserved its decision on compensation until a hearing, scheduled for August 10. Rad Kohanzad, of Atlantic Chambers, Liverpool, said the ruling represented a landmark in British football - as the first instance of racial victimisation being proved by a player. He said: 'Usually, most disputes between club and player are dealt with by the Football League or the Football Association internally. 'However, this is the first race victimisation case that a footballer has brought before an employment tribunal, in a public forum.' Officials at Gillingham said they were 'staggered' by the ruling, saying the club had employed thousands of staff of different races and religions. The club said in a statement: 'Today we have received the decision of the Ashford Employment Tribunal which sets out their findings that Mark McCammon was unfairly dismissed and that his dismissal was an act of racial victimisation. 'We are hugely disappointed, in fact staggered, by this decision. As an organisation we are an equal opportunity employer and do not discriminate against, nor victimise our staff. 'This case is the first of its kind to be brought against the club in its entire history, a history that has seen the club employ many thousands of staff of various race, religion and creed, none of whom have ever felt the need to bring such a claim. 'Given the nature of the case, and the findings, we will discuss the judgment with our lawyers and decide upon the next course of action, whether that be an appeal against the findings, or another form of action, as deemed appropriate. 'There will be no further comment on the case by the club until the matter has run its full course.' McCammon's explosive case comes after high-profile incidents concerning racism allegations in football. This week John Terry vowed to fight an FA charge of making a racist remark towards QPR defender Anton Ferdinand. Terry was found not guilty of a racially aggravated public order offence at Westminster Magistrates Court on July 13. Last season Liverpool's Luis Suarez was banned for racially abusing Patrice Evra but that case never went to court. In February David Cameron hosted a summit at . 10 Downing Street amid widespread concern over racism in football.","Former Barbados international player Mark McCammon, 33, took legal action against Gillingham FC after being dismissed for alleged misconduct last year .

After four exhausting and expensive attempts at IVF failed, Sara and Matthew Conyers feared they were never going to have a family of their own. But five years after the couple’s fertility nightmare began they are celebrating the birth of twins – thanks to the help of a side treatment which involved Mrs Conyers being drip-fed a diet of egg yolks and soya oil. Doctors believe it could help more women achieve their dream of motherhood, with studies showing the concoction has a remarkable success rate at overcoming an immune system problem in which ‘killer cells’ attack a fertilised embryo. A delighted Sara and Matthew with their twin boys William and Ben who were born following a fifth round of IVF . Mrs Conyers, 33, a teacher, and her husband Matthew, 40, a financial adviser, began trying for a child immediately after they  married in August 2007. After two and a half years with no  pregnancy the couple decided to try private IVF treatment. However, the first three attempts – costing £5,000 each time – failed and Mrs Conyers was told cells in her immune system were attacking the fertilised embryos. She was then offered ‘intralipid infusion therapy’. The blend of soya oil and egg products, high in calories and essential fatty acids, is usually used as a nutritional boost for post-operative patients and premature babies. It is thought the mix has a stabilising effect on cell membranes, which makes it harder for killer cells to attack. Content: The newborns pictured sleeping at home. Although Mrs Conyers had the treatment during her fourth IVF course, it took a fifth attempt before she became pregnant . William and Ben, pictured in hospital, are now six weeks old and at home with their parents . Mrs Conyers, of Solihull, West Midlands, said: ‘We didn’t have a holiday for five years but it was all worth it when I found out I was pregnant in October last year. We were more than a little ecstatic.’ Although Mrs Conyers had the treatment during her fourth IVF course, it took a fifth attempt before she became pregnant. On April 4 she gave birth at Worcestershire Royal Hospital to boys William and Ben, who were two months premature. William was the first to be born, weighing 3lb 2oz, followed two minutes later by Ben who tipped the scales at 3lb 10oz. Precious cargo: William and Ben were born four weeks premature . Mrs Conyers said: ‘The first time the IVF didn’t work we  were devastated. However, I’d produced 18 eggs and they were  frozen so they could be used for the next two rounds I had. But still nothing happened. ‘On the fourth IVF attempt I was given the soya oil and egg yolk. I thought it was a bit odd but by that time I was willing to try anything. ‘It was just like a normal drip in your hand but a nurse came to the house and did it. ‘I would recommend anyone who is struggling with IVF to  try it – it has made our dreams come true.’ The couple spent a total of £25,000 on IVF courses. Intralipid infusion therapy is also occasionally used to help women conceive naturally, without any need for IVF. A spokesman for CARE Fertility, which treated Mrs Conyers, said it offered the therapy to women if they think their only problem in getting pregnant is an over-active immune system. ‘Sometimes it is given if the couple is trying to conceive naturally,’ she said. ‘They may be having continual miscarriages but nothing seems to be wrong with them.’ The treatment is always administered by a qualified nurse under a doctor’s instructions.",The rich fatty solution was found to boost IVF success rates by six times in a recent study .

The woman, named locally as 76-year-old Eileen Callaghan, was found dead at the couple’s home in picturesque Haworth, West Yorkshire on Sunday morning, the day after her husband Clement was discovered unconscious following an apparent suicide attempt. Mr Callaghan, who has been arrested on suspicion of murder, was found on Saturday evening in Keighley Road, Colne, Lancashire, which is a 17-mile drive from their home.

British banking giant Standard Chartered is accused of exposing the US to terrorists and weapon dealers by hiding $250 billion (£160 billion) worth of transactions with the Iranian government. Standard Chartered, one of the top five largest banks in the UK by market value, kept around 60,000 transactions secret from US regulators over nearly 10 years, the New York State Department of Financial Services claimed today. The bank, which employs nearly 90,000 people worldwide, has been called to appear before regulators on August 15 to explain the apparent violations and defend its licence to trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Its share price fell 18 percent as world markets reacted to the news, wiping £6 billion from the bank's value. Prices had already dropped six per cent after the accusations were made just before the close of the London market yesterday. The investigation’s findings come after fellow British bank HSBC was accused of allowing drug cartels and rogue states to launder billions of pounds through its US arm. Scroll down for video . Accused: Standard Chartered Bank 'operated as a rogue institution' by 'hiding Iranian transactions' In its findings report, the regulator said: 'For almost 10 years, SCB [Standard Chartered Bank] schemed with the . government of Iran and hid from regulators roughly 60,000 secret . transactions, involving at least $250bn, and reaping SCB hundreds of . millions of dollars in fees. 'SCB's actions left the US financial system . vulnerable to terrorists, weapons dealers, drug kingpins and corrupt . regimes, and deprived law enforcement investigators of crucial . information used to track all manner of criminal activity. 'In short, SCB (Standard Chartered Bank) operated as a rogue institution.' The 27-page report claims the bank was 'apparently aided' by its consultant Deloitte & Touche in concealing the information from regulators, the Guardian reported. The findings include a memo sent in October 2006 from the bank’s US chief executive to the group executive director in London raising concerns about the activities with Iran. He said: 'Firstly, we believe (the Iranian business) needs urgent reviewing at the group level to evaluate if its returns and strategic benefits are... still commensurate with the potential to cause very serious or even catastrophic reputational damage to the group.' He added: 'Secondly, there is equally importantly potential of risk of subjecting management in US and London (for example you and I) and elsewhere to personal reputational damages and/or serious criminal liability.' SCB will have to defend its license so it can continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange, pictured. To which the group executive director . allegedly replied: 'You f****** Americans. Who are you to tell us, the . rest of the world, that we’re not going to deal with Iranians.' In another example the report shows one how in . 2001 the bank was approached by Iran's central bank  CBI/Markazi to . act as recipient for daily oil sales from the National Iranian Oil . Company. Iranians warn the bank that revealing . their identities to US banks would prompt 'unacceptable delays in . clearing funds,' according to the report, the Guardian said. Seeking legal advice, SCB was told it 'should ascertain that the payments are authorized'. But it ignored the warning, instead . 'conspired with Iranian clients to transmit misinformation to the New . York branch by removing and otherwise misrepresenting wire transfer data . that could identify Iranian parties,' the report claims. The . regulator claims that between January 2001 through to 2010, Standard . Chartered conspired with Iranian clients to route payments through New . York after first stripping information from wire transfer messages used . to identify sanctioned countries. The bank moved the transactions through its New York branch on behalf of Iranian financial institutions that were subject to US economic sanctions, and then covered up the dealings, the banking regulator claimed. The institutions included the Central Bank of Iran, as well as Bank Saderat and Bank Melli, both of which are also Iranian state-owned institutions. Benjamin Lawsky, superintendent of the New York State Department for Financial Services, claimed a Standard Chartered subsidiary in New York had also tried to do business with Libya, Burma and Sudan, the Guardian reported. Another dirty revelation: HSBC's David Bagley, left, and . Paul Thurston, also of HSBC, faced a US Senate hearing, which ended in Mr Bagley quitting. Now SBC face a hearing to explain their actions . Financial transactions with Iran have been carefully subjected to strict terms since the 1970s. Restricted, highly scrutinised transactions known as 'U-turns' were allowed as long as the money ended up in non-Iranian banks. But the US treasury revoked U-Turn transactions in 2008 because it suspected Iran was using its banks to fund its highly controversial nuclear weapons and missile programmes and to channel money to terrorist groups. According to Lawsky, Standard Chartered set up an operation known as 'Project Gazelle' aimed at helping Iranian banks put money through the US financial system. Shares in the London-listed bank immediately plummeted in the last few seconds of trading when the damning report was . published just as London's stock market was closing for the day. The attack on Standard Chartered is a heavy blow . to its reputation, which until last night had been regarded . as the most solid of any of the London-listed banks after the 2008 . taxpayer bailouts, the more recent Libor rigging scandal at Barclays, . and the money laundering offences at HSBC. The shocking report follows the scandal of HSBC, which was discovered through a Senate investigation to have allowed rogue states and drugs cartels to launder billions of pounds through its US arm. The findings, which accused HSBC of ignoring warnings and breaching safeguards that should have stopped the laundering of money from Mexico, Iran and Syria, led to the resignation of head of compliance David Bagley. Britain's biggest bank allowed rogue states and drugs cartels to launder billions of pounds through its branches. HSBC stands accused of fostering such a ‘polluted’ culture it became a conduit for criminal enterprises. Top executive David Bagley, head of HSBC’s compliance division, sensationally quit in front of a US Senate hearing that exposed the scale of the scandal. He had worked for HSBC for 20 years. HSBC was warned that the total amount of fines and penalties levelled against it could be 'significantly higher' than the £445million set aside so far.

Staying strong: GMA anchor Robin Roberts looked frail as she addressed fans in a video update from her hospital bed. Today she will undergo her bone marrow transplant . Cast of support: Ms Roberts gets a visit from GMA co-worker Sam Champion, who wore a mask to protect her from germs from the outside world . Wearing a pink baseball cap and navy top and pants, clutching a cold drink, she said in the video on her GMA blog: 'This journey is as much about the mind as it is the body. 'Thoughts. Thoughts are so powerful. You've got to change the way you think in order to change the way you feel,' she continued. Then, repeating the words, almost as . if to remind herself: 'You've got to change the way you think in order . to change the way you feel.' She also thanked fans for their love and . support, adding: 'And let me just say this lastly, I feel the love and I . thank you for it. Thank you.' Positive thinking: Wearing a pink baseball cap and navy top and pants, clutching a cold drink, Ms Roberts said: 'This journey is as much about the mind as it is the body' Robin's room: In another clip, she showed off her 'disco pole', which had been dressed with tinsel . Ms Roberts, her doctors and her 'ABC . Family' have been keeping fans up-to-date on her progress and today, her . oncologist, Dr Gail Roboz, joined George Stephanopoulos on GMA to . explain her progress so far. On form: The TV host pictured on GMA in August, before her admission to hospital . Explaining the difference between the therapy that Ms Roberts was having over the summer, compared with the the last week, Dr Roboz said: 'We could see in watching Robin over the summer that she looked . fantastic, she was having an easy time with it. 'That was . really MDS-directed treatment. That was to mow the lawn, get rid of as . many MDS cells as possible, boost the bone marrow and get ready for the . transplant.' For the past eight days, though, Ms Roberts has been having two-and-a-half hour chemotherapy every six hours, followed by a staggering continuous 18 hours on Tuesday. 'This type of therapy over the last week has been much more . intensive,' Dr Roboz said. 'This isn't just mowing the lawn and not getting . rids of the weeds on top, it's digging down deeper and really trying to . empty out the bone marrow cells and get rid of the immune system cells . so that the new ones from Sally-Ann can come on in.' Unsurprisingly, the aggressive treatment, which has wiped out the television presenter's entire immune system, has left her feeling wiped-out. Dr Roboz continued: '[Robin is] a powerhouse but she feels . crummy. Her mouth hurts. She's got a headache that won't quit. Nothing . tastes right. It's hard to get up and even move around in the room. 'This . is someone who's used to 50 hours a day and an athlete with tremendous . stamina. It's powerful to hear her say that reading a few emails or . sitting up in bed is a lot of work.' Wiped out: For the past eight days, Ms Roberts has been having two-and-a-half hour chemotherapy every six hours, followed by a staggering continuous 18 hours on Tuesday . The next few months will mark the 'rebuilding phase', Dr Roboz explained. 'Rebuilding is not immediate. It takes weeks to months… Sally Ann's cells will be trying to set up shop to set up an immune system and marrow to fight off infection.' Ms Roberts wrote a touching message on her blog on Tuesday to let people know that she's staying positive. 'Last Sunday to lift my spirits I threw a . little party at my apartment for my GMA family,' she wrote. 'The next morning I . walked through the hospital doors, with my guardian angels - mom & . dad - back together and blazing a trail ahead of me.' She also described how her body was responding to the daily doses of chemotherapy. 'The . start of last week went well but the daily chemo/treatment caught up to . me by the weekend,' it read. The GMA family: Ms Roberts tweeted a photo from her send off, before her admission to hospital. She is seen between her co-host Josh Elliot (left) and ABC's senior executive producer Tom Cibrowski (right) 'My body is so weak but not my mind. YOU . give me the courage to keep going.' 'So today is my last day of chemo... Wednesday is called a day of rest, yay, right! The transplant is . scheduled for Thursday morning.' Myelodysplastic syndromes are a group of diseases in which the bone marrow does not make enough healthy blood cells. It affects about 18,000 people each year - but only several hundred of those are as a result of cancer treatment. Symptoms can include shortness of breath, weakness or feeling tired, . skin that is paler than usual, easy bruising or bleeding and fever or . frequent infections. The primary approach to treating MDS is a bone marrow transplant. The more closely matched the donor and recipient are, the more likely . the immune system will not reject the new marrow and treatment will be . successful. The star will undergo the bone marrow transplant to treat a rare blood disorder called myelodysplastic syndrome or MDS - her sister Sally-Ann is the donor. The procedure is expected to last between 30 to 60 minutes, and afterwards Ms Roberts will stay in a room designed to keep the air as clean as possible in order to protect her from any germs or infections, though friends and family will still be welcome to visit. The disease has damaged the GMA host's bone marrow, and likely arose as a result of the chemotherapy Roberts' underwent in 2007 to successfully treat her breast cancer, according to GMA's chief health and medical editor, Richard Besser. Ms Roberts isn't expected to reclaim her seat on GMA for several months, to allow her time to recover. The TV anchor suffered another emotional blow on August 30 when her beloved mother, Lucimarian, passed away at home in Mississippi at the age of 88 - her father, Lawrence, died in 2004. 'I think she misses her mom a lot and I think it's been really hard to . go through this,' Dr Roboz revealed. 'She said yesterday this is the first hard . thing that she's had to go through without her mom. So I think that's . been a real challenge but she is a trooper and fighting through it and . doing very, very well.'","The GMA anchor, 51, has spent the past 11 days in hospital preparing for the procedure, undergoing eight days of intensive chemotherapy ."

A disinfectant that is harmless to humans but deadly to superbugs is poised to become the latest weapon against hospital infections. The germ-destroying product called Akwaton, works at low concentrations according to a study from the Université de Saint-Boniface in Canada. Researchers tested the compound against bacterial spores of Clostridium difficile that attach to surfaces and are difficult to destroy. Cleaning: Bacteria found in hospitals can survive on surfaces for long periods of time . Previous work by the group has shown Akwaton is also effective at low concentrations against strains of MRSA and E coli. Spore-forming bacteria including C. difficile and MRSA can survive on surfaces for long periods of time. Spores are heat-tolerant and can continue for a number of years in a dehydrated state before they are reactivated. Most chemical disinfectants control or prevent spore growth rather than irreversibly destroying them. The latest study showed that Akwaton was able to destroy Bacillus subtilis bacterial spores, suspended in water and attached to stainless steel or glass surfaces, at concentrations well below one per cent after just 90 seconds' treatment. It was equally as effective at more dilute concentrations (below 0.1 per cent) if left to act for longer periods. Lead researcher Dr Mathias Oulé, explained the advantages over other chemical compounds currently used against bacterial spores. 'Most disinfectants have to be applied at much higher concentrations – typically between 4-10 per cent - to properly get rid of bacterial spores. 'Unfortunately such high levels of these compounds may also be harmful to humans and other animals. Akwaton is non-corrosive, non-irritable, odourless and is effective at very low concentrations,' he said. 'Bacterial spores demonstrate a remarkable resistance to physical and chemical agents as well as ordinary antiseptics. On top of this micro-organisms are becoming increasingly resistant to disinfectants as well as antibiotics. 'Our latest study shows Akwaton is effective at destroying these spores as well as bacteria that are known problems in healthcare environments.' The product is produced by Fofaton Akwaton International, which is based in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. The study is reported online in the Journal of Medical Microbiology.","Scientists said Akwaton was non-irritable, odourless and effective at 'low concentrations'"

Hospitals are sending hundreds of thousands of confidential letters about patients to India to be typed up by poorly-paid workers. NHS trusts have been accused of laying off their secretaries and instead dispatching patients’ notes more than 6,000 miles to save money on staffing costs. In the last year, at least 650,000 letters containing sensitive medical information are known to have been sent to India by a total of eight trusts, but many others are likely to be doing the same. MPs warn that complicated medical terms may be mis-translated by the Indian workers leading to ‘tragic consequences’. Outsourced: A series of London-area hospitals, including Great Ormond Street (pictured), has admitted using cheap secretarial agencies in India to type patient letters . At least one hospital – Addenbrooke’s . in Cambridge – has already been forced to stop sending letters to India . because the standard was so much worse. Normally after seeing a patient a . doctor dictates a referral letter to a consultant into a tape recorder, . which is far quicker than typing it out. This is then given to the . doctor’s medical secretary who types it up and sends it, saving the . doctor time. But recently hospitals have begun . setting up schemes with private firms whereby the recordings are sent to . India to be typed up and returned a few weeks later. Figures obtained by Labour MP John . Spellar under the Freedom of Information Act show that in 2011/12, West . Middlesex University Hospital trust in west London, sent 234,000 letters . to India. Great Ormond Street Hospital trust in . Central London sent 123,000 letters, while North Middlesex University . Hospital trust in north London sent 137,000. Last week the former health secretary Andrew Lansley (pictured) admitted that his own local hospital, Addenbrooke's, had ended its contract because the quality of the letters coming back was poor . Other NHS trusts that said they . routinely dispatch letters to India  were: Kingston Hospital in . south-west London; Epsom and St Helier University in south London and . Surrey; the Whittington Hospital in north London; the Royal National . Orthopaedic Hospital in north London. Barts and the London in east . London also admitted dispatching letters in the last year but said it . had stopped the practice in July. It did not provide a reason. Several of the NHS trusts insist . there is no risk that patients’ confidentiality will be breached as . their names and dates of birth are removed beforehand. But last week the former health . secretary Andrew Lansley admitted that his own local hospital, . Addenbrooke’s, had ended its contract because the quality of the letters . coming back was poor. Mr Spellar, who raised the issue in . the Commons last week, said: ‘There is a safety issue. There’s the . potential for something to go tragically wrong. ‘If someone gives the wrong advice . and this is not picked up then a patient could be misdiagnosed or seen . less urgently than they should be.’ He added that it was ‘outrageous’ that NHS jobs were being outsourced abroad. ‘Unemployment in the UK is at . unacceptable levels and the economy is suffering the worst double dip . recession since the Second World War,’ he said. ‘Medical secretaries are being . downgraded or laid off. This is work that could easily be based and . carried out in the UK, maintaining jobs and keeping opportunities for . our young people.’ Mr Spellar has not yet received replies from all NHS trusts in England but he suspects others are also sending letters abroad. Recently it has also emerged that a . number of primary care trusts – which oversee GP services – have also . been sending patient letters abroad. At least 46 PCTs have signed a deal . with a private firm which involves having some of their administrative . and secretarial work outsourced to India.

A RAPIST who won £5million on the  lottery was jailed yesterday for fraudulently claiming £13,000 in benefits. Edward Putman told the authorities he was destitute and about to be evicted – despite having millions in the bank. The housing and council tax benefit and income support he received amounted to only four weeks’ interest on his jackpot. The fraud was revealed after he tried to buy his council house in cash and suspicious officials began probing his finances. Cheat: Edward Putman, left, in September 1999 . and right, at a recent court appearance. He began receiving income . support in 2000 after being incapacitated by anxiety issues and his . benefits were suspended in 2009 . Putman, 46, who had declined publicity . after his 2009 win, first appeared in court last month, after which his . ex accused him of concealing his fortune to avoid paying maintenance to . their son. Judge Andrew Bright jailed him for nine months after hearing . how the multi-millionaire wrote to the Department for Work and Pensions . and his council to say he was borrowing money and selling possessions . to make ends meet. Sentencing him at St Albans Crown . Court in Hertfordshire, the judge said: ‘This was planned and . premeditated and, I am satisfied, was motivated by sheer greed. Though . you had won £5million on the lottery you carried on claiming benefits to . which you were not entitled. Your greed was on a scale which, frankly, . defies belief.’ Putman’s rape victim, who was 17 when he attacked her in 1991, told the Mail: ‘It’s nice to know that he is behind bars. Pure greed: The convicted rapist's scam was discovered when he tried to pay a cash deposit of £84,000 for a house . ‘He had the world at his fingertips and could have done what he wanted with that money.’ Putman’s image of respectability in a . £600,000 detached house in Kings Langley, Hertfordshire, unravelled . after he appeared in court on June 12. His ex-partner Gail, 51, whose . surname the Mail has agreed not to use, came forward to say: ‘He paid . less than £200 maintenance in 12 years.’ Gail’s 22-year-old daughter from . another relationship also accused the bricklayer of abusing her by . making her undress in front of him when she was a child. ‘Eddy comes across as a charmer but he . is really a Jekyll and Hyde character,’ she said. ‘He’s won millions . and it couldn’t have happened to a less deserving person. He’s a . monster.’ His rape victim, who was three months’ pregnant when he attacked her in Milton Keynes, called him a . ‘psychopath’ and said he punched her so hard during the attack she . thought her head would ‘cave in’. Putman was jailed for seven years in . 1993 for the offence, as well as indecent assault and intimidating a . witness. He served four years. When his benefits were suspended in . 2010 he wrote asking for them to be reinstated. He said: ‘I have been . borrowing from family and friends for my daily needs. I have no money in . my bank account. ‘Money I have managed to get has been from selling my belongings, as I will not need them any more, as I expect to be evicted.’ In fact, he was living in his new home . and had a fleet of cars parked outside, including a BMW X5 M Sport and a . BMW M3 convertible. The Lotto winner admitted two offences of failing . to notify the authorities of a change in circumstances. Putman, who had faced a maximum seven-year term, spent most of yesterday’s hearing staring at the floor as he sat in the dock. Afterwards he released a statement which said: ‘I can only apologise for the offences I have committed.’ Sentenced: The fraudster was told he was motivated by 'sheer greed' at St Alban's Crown Court .","Edward Putman scooped almost £5million, but told local council he could barely afford to eat .

A disgraced solicitor who stole over £300,000 of his clients' cash has been jailed for two years. Robert Cutty, 63, pocketed £140,000 of his trusting clients' money and transferred tens of thousands of pounds between customer accounts to try to cover his tracks. The consultant solicitor, described by his lawyer as 'a man of great standing in the community', even took £50,000 from one client's estate to cover up a mistake he made on another. But colleagues at the Harding, Swinburn and Jackson law firm in Sunderland discovered the extensive deception when Cutty was off work ill. Cutty, whose wife was oblivious to his wrongdoings, was said to live 'beyond his means' in an old mansion with high running costs. Cutty's activities began in 2003 when he transferred £33,000 from one client's account into his own. He struck again in 2005, taking £52,500 from a dead client's estate. The solicitor then transferred vast sums of money between client accounts to try to disguise the shortfall, helping himself to another £62,000. He also moved £50,000 from one client to another to cover up having paid the amount to the client in error. Colleagues caught him out in 2010, noticing discrepancies on his accounts when he was off sick. A Solicitors' Regulatory Authority investigation identified the dishonest transactions. Cutty was arrested and told police he had taken the money to cover 'living expenses'. He pleaded guilty to four charges of obtaining by deception and five of fraud. Michael Bunch, prosecuting, told Newcastle Crown Court: 'In total the amount covered by the nine counts is just over £300,000. 'Clearly some of the money was taken by him for his own purpose and some was to cover up earlier dishonest transactions. 'His personal benefit would appear to be in the region of £140,000.'It simply would appear to be a lifestyle lived beyond his means.' The court was told that all clients, included the estates of two deceased customers, have been refunded. Cutty had repaid £10,000 at the start of the fraud. Jamie Adams, defending, said Cutty's activities began when he took money as a loan, claiming a client had authorised the move before she died. Newcastle Crown Court, pictured, heard that Cutty was 'a man of great standing' in the local community . The cash was used to settle a tax bill and then his finances grew out of control which led to more transactions and the extensive attempts at covering up his work. Supporters of Cutty watched from the public gallery as Judge Michael Cartlidge jailed the shamed solicitor for two years. The judge said: 'His problem is he is before the court for offending when he was in a position of trust in relation to clients at the firm. 'His behaviour has damaged the firm in all sorts of ways, not just in the very large cost of extra insurance but the cost of investigating the fraud and reputational damage.' Mr Adams, who presented a stack of character testimonials at the start of the hearing, said: 'There is no lavish lifestyle here at all, nothing of that sort. 'He doesn’t have anything anymore. 'It is an appallingly sad situation when you consider he was a man of great standing in the community.'","Robert Cutty said to live 'beyond his means'

The nostalgic scene could come straight from the pages of a history book. Or perhaps a modern sideshow to demonstrate the methods of a bygone age. Yet this is just an ordinary working day for farmer Robert Sampson – who has chosen to ditch machinery to stay true to the traditional ways his family have used for five generations. Horsing around: A normal working day for farmer Robert Sampson - who has . chosen to ditch machinery to stay true to the traditional methods his . family have used for five generations . His beasts of burden may not be as fast as a tractor, but Mr Sampson believes they do a reliable – and often better – job. And such is his enthusiasm for the old methods, he didn’t even bother to fix a tractor he kept for occasional jobs such as trimming pastures when it broke down recently. So now his four strapping Percheron horses do all the work. The 56-year-old farmer takes them out each day to plough and roll the ground, to sow crops and to turn hay on his 265-acre farm in Hampshire. But his determination to remain loyal to the old ways brings its challenges. Horse-drawn ploughs can no longer be bought, so Mr Sampson has had to convert all the machinery himself from equipment designed to be pulled by tractor. Happy family: Three generations of the Sampson family in the yard of their old fashioned property. Son Tom Sampson with daughters Megan and Isabel and Robert with wife Barbara. Horseplay: The end of the day - Hard work, but Robert maintains it is much more satisfying than using a tractor . Sturdy stallions: Four strapping Percherons do all the work. The . 56-year-old farmer takes them out each day to plough and roll the . ground, to sow crops and to turn hay on his 265-acre farm in Hampshire . Hardworking: Although it takes him three times as long to till the land . as it would with a tractor Robert maintains the economic benefits as . well as his enjoyment more than make up for the slightly slower . progress . The Sampson family has owned Harbridge Farm, near Ringwood, since 1882, and it has always had working horses. ‘My father never fully mechanised the farm and we used horses in conjunction with tractors,’ Mr Sampson said. ‘Using horses is slow but for some jobs they are better, such as rolling crops, because the machine works better if you do it slowly. ‘We have 265 acres of land and they work on anything and everything. 'I’m doing my bit to save the environment because I am producing my own fuel and I am self-sufficient with the horses. ‘I do it because I enjoy it, I love it. People think I’m mad and there are times when I think I am.’ A tractor is several times faster than horses. In a day it can plough ten acres of land compared with only two with horses. For grass cutting, a tractor is around three times faster. And for harrowing – smoothing the surface of the soil – a tractor can do six times as many acres in the same time. But despite its inefficiency, the old fashioned approach is supported by Mr Sampson’s wife Barbara, 56. ‘Robert gets a lot of pleasure from it,’ she said.

Early treatment can prevent the need for expensive . dialysis or transplant and cuts the risk of strokes and heart attacks. Our kidneys filter out waste products from the blood before converting them into urine. They also help maintain blood pressure. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long-term condition where the kidneys do not work as well as normal. CKD is very common and the risk increases as you age. It is also more common among south Asian and black people. CKD does not usually cause any symptoms until it has reached an advanced stage. It can be detected early on via blood and urine tests. The main symptoms of advanced kidney disease include tiredness, swollen ankles or hands, shortness of breath, nausea and blood in urine. Those with the condition have a greater risk of having a stroke or heart attack. It can also cause kidney failure, when sufferers will need to have dialysis and possible transplant. However, lifestyle changes and medication can stop it getting worse if it's diagnosed at an early stage.

"By . Emma Reynolds . UPDATED: . 10:18 EST, 6 December 2011 . More than 800 British businesses a day collapsed last year - the highest number ever recorded. It was the second year in a row in which more companies closed down than started up, according to the figures released by the Office of National Statistics. The bleak economic outlook is . discouraging entrepreneurs from taking a risk on a new venture, leaving the prospects for growth even more gloomy. Financial mess: Protesters at St Paul's Cathedral are just one sign of how bad the economy is looking, with far more businesses collapsing than opening . As many as 297,000 firms across the country folded between 2009 and 2010 - a sharp increase of 20,000 on the year before. That is more than 813 closures every single day. In the same year, just 235,000 opened - 1,000 fewer than started up between 2008 and 2009. It means that the total number of active businesses is declining, leaving Britain in a worrying position. There were 42,000 fewer active companies in the UK in 2010 than in 2009 - with around 2.3million operating in total. The extreme actions of the protesters at St Paul's provide a stark reminder of just how bad the country's financial situation has become. With the number of thriving businesses flagging, business secretary Vince Cable will need to act urgently to turn the situation around. Future problems: Business Secretary Vince Cable will need to act urgently to turn the situation around . Last year, the worst-hit sector was business administration and support services, which had a 'death rate' of 22.6 per cent, in which 45,000 companies collapsed. The science and technical industry - a vital area if Britain wants to boost its economy - saw a frightening 53,000 firms close down. The construction business was also looking weak, with new housing and building work slowing down as the country feels the pinch. But the booming health industry shows little sign of slowing down despite the grim financial climate. Just 5,000 health-related firms shut last year - a closure rate of 5.2 per cent. All sectors and regions now have a closure rate that is higher than their rate of newly opening businesses. The highest rate of start-ups came in information and communication, where 23,000 opened (a 13.4 per cent 'birth rate'). Even more worryingly, Britain's supposed jobs capital - London - is the part of the country suffering the most. It had the biggest rate of closures last year, with 60,000 business collapsing - a rate of 15.1 per cent. Industry in Northern Ireland looks the most healthy, with only 5,000 companies closing between 2009 and 2010. But it is the North-West of England that is experiencing the worst overall slump in industry, with 8,000 more companies collapsing than were opened last year. Firms are also failing earlier, with only 90 per cent surviving their first year, where 96 per cent got at least that far in 2005. The two-year survival rate was down by 5.8 per cent in 2008 from 79.8 per cent in 2005.","There were 42,000 fewer active businesses in the UK in 2010 than in 2009 .

Penny Cope seemed a healthy, happy three-year-old as she rushed around at her pre-school's sports day. But a chance visit from the local vet revealed the little girl had an unexpected and potentially fatal condition. Vicky Tilston visited Penny's school Appleshaw in Hampshire to talk about her job, during which she asked the children to listen to each other's hearts with a stethoscope. She was called over by the group's supervisor Trudie Tobutt, who had noticed Penny's heart had an unusual rhythm and made a 'whooshing' sound when she breathed. Ms Tilston advised Penny's mother Kate Riney to get it checked out and next day the little girl had an ECG and a chest X-ray at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital at the end of June. Doctors found she had a hole in the wall of her heart and a narrowing in the artery, blocking the flow of blood to her lungs. Penny is now preparing for open heart surgery to fix the problem. Ms Riney, from Wherwell, said: 'If it hadn't been for the vet visiting the pre-school, this might not have been picked up in time. 'Penny has always been the healthiest little girl, running about everywhere. 'We had no reason to think there was anything wrong. When they found out about her heart condition, I just couldn't believe it. Words can't describe how I felt. 'There had been no symptoms at all. It makes me think she is definitely a strong little girl to have coped with it for three years. Someone is watching over Penny.' Surgeons will decide on August 8th when to operate on Penny but it should be later in the month.They hope a patch over the hole in her heart will solve the problem for life. Ms Riney wants other parents to be aware heart problems are not always picked up. Penny had an ECG at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester . She said Penny, who has a five-year-old sister Molly, had only ever suffered the usual coughs and colds and ultra-sound scans during pregnancy had not picked it up. 'She has never been a really sickly child so we had no idea at all,' she said. Congenital heart disease is one of the most common types of birth defect, and affects an estimated six in every 1,000 babies born in England. Two main categories are septal defects (a hole between two of the heart's chambers) and obstruction defects where there is a blockage of the flow of blood through the chambers of the heart. Symptoms of these conditions include breathlessness, tiring easily during exercise and swelling in the feet, however Penny showed no symptoms.","Vet asked the children to listen to each others hearts with a stethoscope during a talk about her job .

"Ukraine is to host several games played by German's national team . Football players reportedly executed after beating German team in 1942 . By . Catherine Eade . PUBLISHED: . 14:18 EST, 10 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:15 EST, 11 April 2012 . Ukrainian officials fear that a film called The Match, in which courageous Ukrainian players oppose German-speaking Nazi athletes against a backdrop of giant swastikas, may stoke anti-German feeling ahead of the Euro 2012 football tournament. Regulators say the film could incite aggressive fans just weeks before Ukraine hosts several games played by Germany's national team during the 2012 European Championship from June 8-July 1. 'There always are people - hooligans - who use football to spill out their aggression and some of those people may be influenced by (the film),' said political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko. A still from The Match, the controversial Russian movie depicting a legendary football match between Soviet soccer players and Nazi soldiers played in 1942 and dubbed 'the Death Match' The film is based on the 1942 match between the Nazi occupiers and Kiev's top football team . Ukraine is freezing the release because of the potentially explosive emotions it may cause ahead of the the Euro 2012 Championship which kicks off in June . Every Ukrainian knows about the . so-called 'Death Match' of August 9 1942, when top Kiev soccer players . beat a team of Nazi occupiers and reputedly paid for it with their . lives. Ukraine's . State Cinema Agency was due to make a ruling by April 6 but it has . delayed a decision until May 1, distributor Inter Film said. ‘The situation is unclear, Inter Film spokeswoman Yulia Yatsenko said. '(The movie) is in limbo.’ The . film tells the story of the 1942 match, which pitted a Wehrmacht team . against players from Kiev's top club Dynamo and other athletes. The . Ukrainian team won 5-3 despite reported warnings from the SS that they . must lose to their occupiers. Most team members were subsequently arrested and some were executed. A Soviet journalist dubbed the game the 'Death Match' and Soviet authorities cultivated the legend . that the entire team was executed by the Nazis due to winning the match. The team in Russian film The Match, in which top Kiev football players defeated a team of Nazi invaders and, as legend has it, paid for it with their lives . 'Propaganda': The movie was set to premiere in Kiev in May, just weeks before Ukraine co-hosts the Euro 2012 football championship. But the Ukrainian cinematography agency will take another month to decide whether to release the movie . A . monument to those players stands outside the Dynamo stadium  in Kiev and their heroism inspired the 1981 film Escape To Victory starring Sylvester Stallone and Pele. The Dynamo Stadium monument in Kiev depicting some of the players reputedly executed by the Nazis . In The Match the actor playing team captain Nikolai Ranevich says, with eyes filling with tears, 'Some things are worth dying for,' and he convinces his team to beat the Nazis in a show of resistance and patriotism. Some historians say that while defeating the Nazi team was undoubtedly courageous, there is no evidence to suggest all the players were executed in revenge. Nine of the players were arrested about a week after the match. One died in custody and three others were shot in a Kiev concentration camp six months later, according to Volodymyr Prystaiko, a former Soviet security officer who wrote a book on the match. German investigators concluded in 2005 there was no evidence linking the death of the three players to the match. The film's distributor wanted The Match to premiere in Ukraine on May 3 and the state cinema agency was to announce its decision on whether to approve the movie last week. But agency spokeswoman Larisa Titarenko says the regulator will take another 25 working days to analyse the movie. Yaroslav Pidhora-Gvyazdovskiy, a member of the expert commission reviewing The Match, says he recommended banning the movie because it promotes ethnic strife. Most of the characters who collaborate with the Nazis speak Ukrainian while the admirable characters in it speak Russian and fearlessly oppose the invaders, he said. The real thing: Kiev's historic football team called Start, made up of Dynamo players and other Ukraine athletes, who beat the Nazis despite being warned by the SS that they should deliberately lose . Tribute: The Ukrainian match was the Inspiration forthe 1981 film Escape to Victory which starred (L-R) Bobby Moore, Michael Caine and Sylvester Stallone and a host of top international footballers . Independent movie critic Volodymyr Voitenko said the movie should be banned. 'It's ideological propaganda, which is part of Russia's neo-imperialist policy,' Voitenko says. 'It's a political question and the state must decide whether to allow being spat in the face or not.' Movie producer Dmitry Kulikov has accused Ukrainian movie officials of bowing to pressure from 'radical nationalist groups.' 'There is nothing anti-Ukrainian about this movie,' Kulikov says. 'We made a movie about the heroic deed of Ukrainians and Kiev residents during the war.' Many historians say Ukraine's role in the war is still largely . overlooked, with Soviet . and Ukrainian archives closed to historians for almost 50 years, but research  has shown that the country lost more people in World War II . than any other European country.

A Romanian gipsy couple were last night jailed for bringing a child into Britain and keeping her as a slave. She was saved only when a 53-year-old . man similarly kept as a slave in the garden shed of the family’s London . council house escaped - and told police of a ‘Cinderella’ used as a . servant. Astonished officers found the . seven-year-old girl had been forced to sleep on the floor, had no . possessions beyond the filthy clothes she was wearing and had been . ‘beaten like a carpet’. Jailed: Aurel Zlate, 46, and his 43-year-old wife Alexandra Oaie repeatedly beat and humiliated the girl and have now been jailed with their two son for a total of more than 40 years . She had been kept barefoot and eight of her black rotten teeth had to be removed. She was unable to count to ten in her own language. The family’s eight children, . meanwhile, wore fashionable clothes, and were allowed to go to school – . when not out working for their parents as trained thieves and beggars. The family used money from crime and benefits to buy ‘palaces’ in Romania. Judge Shani Barnes, who noted that . much-criticised Haringey council had failed to respond to repeated . reports of a man being kept in a shed, said she was appalled such crimes . could be committed in 21st-century London. The shed where the Cinderella slavery victim was forced to live. The little girl was forced her to sleep on the floor and the family gave her no shoes and one pair of clothes . Yesterday husband and wife Aurel-Ilie . Zlatea, 45, and Alexandra Oaie, 44, and their sons Marian Neamu, 25, . and Florin Zlatea, 23, were jailed for between nine and 13 years for a . series of offences. The sons had also battered and raped their adult slave after he asked for food on New Year’s Eve. All maintained their innocence but . were convicted at a six-week trial. Judge Barnes told them: ‘You stole . this sweet and innocent little girl’s childhood by your neglect and . cruelty. I can only imagine the purpose was to train her as a servant . for your family. There is no evidence of you giving her any care . whatsoever. By the time she was six she had been your servant for years. ‘She slept on the floor, never owned . shoes, and had only the clothes she stood up in. She washed, cooked and . cleaned for you, and was described as a Cinderella, while all your own . children had fashionable clothes and went to school. No one had taken . the time to talk to her or hold her.’ Judge Barnes told Croydon Crown Court . that the mother of the family, Oaie, was ‘cold, cynical and . manipulative’ and that her ‘cruel nature’ was behind the ghastly living . conditions suffered by both ‘slaves’. The girl's shed where she was forced to live. It was revealed for the first time today that Haringey Council had continually been called to investigate the house, but did nothing until after the police became involved . Speaking of the man’s existence as a ‘filthy, cold, scavenging man living in a twilight misery’, the judge added: ‘It is hard to believe this was happening in leafy Wood Green in 2011.’ The jury heard that the family had employed the 53-year-old electrician at their luxury gated home in Romania, took his ID card and driving licence from him, and in 2010 brought him to Britain. In London, he found the Cinderella girl working for the family. She had been a daughter of Zlatea’s cleaner, and he had persuaded her to give him the child ‘for a better life’. The male captive was so shocked by the girl’s plight that he named her Cenusareasa, the Romanian name for Cinderella. The man said the girl was ‘like a frightened animal’ who was forced to carry debris on a building site, and look after animals and other children who ‘beat her like she was a carpet’. The youngster, who is now eight, is in foster care in Britain. Within weeks of being rescued, after emergency dental care, she had learnt to count and can now read and speak fluent English. She is said to be flourishing. Zlatea was jailed for nine and a half years, Oaie for nine, and Marian and Florin for 13 and nine years respectively. All four are due to be sent back to Romania on release, but Judge Barnes said: ‘I don’t have any guarantee that they will be deported.’ Detective Inspector Kevin Hyland said outside court: ‘It is hard to believe that something like this could be happening behind the closed doors of an ordinary house in Haringey. There was horror going on behind those curtains.’ The couple’s other children are being raised by relatives in Romania.

'Although this will die away a bit overnight it will be back tomorrow, . when there could even be hail. White cover: Gardens in Rowlands Castle, Hants were covered by hail storms . Heavy rain: A car wheel in a flooded gulley near Rowlands Castle, Hants . 'The unsettled conditions will . continue until next week, when we will start to see bands of rain . instead of showers, which means more prolonged wet weather.' Around 50mm is expected to fall by Sunday, which is the same as the total rainfall expected for the whole month. But much more rain would be needed to fill rivers and reservoirs and relieve the drought in the South and East. Weather experts said that areas affected by drought need more than 400mm of rain to get back to normal levels. In Scotland, ski resorts have been told that they may be able to reopen thanks to a chance of snowfall. It is a stark contrast to last April - . which was the hottest since 1910, with temperatures regularly topping . 25c (77F) -  and comes just weeks after a March heatwave that sent . scores of Brits to the beach. Mr Goodfellow said: 'We're going to . need an awful lot of rain over a great deal of time to solve the drought . problem. Anything is going to help, but it does not look like what . we're going to see over the next few days will be sustainable.' Days at the races: Despite the cold weather the crowd at Aintree races, Liverpool all donned their traditional bright outfits . Lucky: Compared to the hailstone in the south of the country, the race goers were lucky with their sun, if not chilly weather . The Environment Agency yesterday warned that drought-afflicted areas, like much of southern of England, are at higher risk of flash flooding, especially in built-up areas. Dry, compacted soils mean that rainfall is less easily absorbed into the ground, increasing the likelihood of flooding if the country is hit by storms. This was seen in June and July 2007, when a dry winter and spring were followed by devastating floods, which hit the West Country, Midlands and Yorkshire. The forecast looks bleak for those heading to Grand National at Aintree on Saturday. Steady rain is forecast in the Liverpool area over the next few days and conditions on the course are expected to be the muddiest and most difficult since the famous mudbath of 2001, when Richard Guest splashed to victory riding Red Marauder. Clerk of the course Andrew Tulloch expects the ground to be 'soft' - but expects the race to go ahead, regardless how muddy it gets. He said: 'We've had at least 13mm of steady drizzle and, looking at the radar, there should be more to come on Tuesday with further possible showers on Wednesday and Thursday.' 'The grass is in excellent condition, partly as a result of the warm winter we had, and that makes a difference, as it will help soak up a lot of the moisture,' he told the Guardian. 'But the going is already soft in most places on the National course and we're definitely looking at conditions being on the slow side. We've been aiming to get something between good and good to soft.' Changing weather: Three day weather forecast from Friday to Sunday . Lightning flashes during a thunderstorm . It has been a while since such widespread outbreaks of thunderstorms, so this is an ideal opportunity to look at lightning and its varieties. Most people make a distinction between sheet lightning and forked lightning. However, sheet lightning is merely a lightning stroke within a cloud or between clouds (or below the horizon). It is obscured by the clouds themselves, making them diffusely refulgent. This is known as cloud-to-cloud lightning, caused by differing electric potential within a cloud or across clouds. Sometimes it is visible, especially in mature thunder clouds, as a filigree wandering across the underside of the anvil - hence the name 'anvil crawler.' The most dangerous, though, is cloud-to-ground lightning, often shortened to CG, caused by the potential between the negatively charged base of the cloud and the positively charged ground. Ground-to-cloud lightning (GC) is rarer, initiated from the ground rather than the cloud, often by a tall building or tower. Most CG strikes comprise negative strokes (negative charge in the cloud base transferring to the ground) but about 5% are positive strokes, which are more powerful. These originate high in the cloud where there can be a strong positive charge; occasionally this will be in the anvil itself. The lightning may hit the ground directly beneath the cloud but can strike below the tenuous edges of the anvil, sometimes more than nine miles (15km) away from the cloud's centre. This can give the appearance of appearing out of nowhere - hence the figurative basis of the metaphorical phrase a bolt from the blue.'","Hailstone, heavy rain and gusts of wind swept across Britain today .

The booing of Gideon Osborne, where we saw that time lapse between the noise and his desperate arranging of his features into insouciance, was 'a moment' that went on for a long time. I felt sorry for Theresa May - and that is a new emotion - when she got much the same treatment. Feelgood Olympics turns on Feelbad Ministers. Send them to murderball. But feelings are raw. As the kids go back to school, many parents of children with special needs have just been told they will not be getting help. Access courses are fast disappearing. Brave face: Chancellor George Osborne smiles as he is booed at the Paralympics . The Conservatives may love a conservatory, but allowing even bigger home extensions is a joke as a policy. The Tories are regrouping to the Right rather than reaching out to those they need to win an Election. Only Boris, who has used the Olympics as a rally, is doing OK. The back-to-school feel of politics - a reshuffle and Prime Minister's Questions - seem small fry compared with what is happening out there. Spain is on fire. There are massive demos. The government is stocking up on tear gas. There are places where miners are using rocket launchers against the police in order to keep their jobs. Austerity means massive youth unemployment. Work is no answer if there are no jobs. Depressing: 'The Tories decided to let a generation go to waste' Still, here it's all runways and loft conversions. The obsession with Heathrow is beyond me and I live in London, so how it plays in other parts of the country is hard to say. But it's not hard to say that the Tories decided to let large parts of the country and a generation go to waste. The political calculation is that these people were never going to vote Tory anyway. This is politics devoid of ideas - or even a sense of how this all-white Cabinet appears. The announcement that Hunt, or 'the back channel' as he was referred to during Leveson, is to be in charge of the NHS is gob-smacking. Most people don't think he should be in charge of a doll's house. David Laws, who swizzed £40,000 from taxpayers, is back too. In what other job would this be OK? The moral compass is spinning off the table and yet the man with visibility issues - Ed Miliband - has only just surfaced. Sure, he can have a holiday, and at least his friend has reassured us Ed is now in a 'deep and reflective space'. Coolio. The bottom of a lake? He has been thinking deep things, though it's hard to know much of anything from the teddy bear-baiting of Prime Minister's Questions. Cameron cornered is nasty. And this week just plain weird. It was a peculiar carry-on. Ed Balls sat nodding like some mafioso capo. Clegg, as always, looked as though he was imagining himself elsewhere to get through it, when Cameron lost his rag and blurted to Miliband: 'Apparently, you still have to bring him [Balls] coffee every morning - that's just how assertive and butch the leader of the Opposition really is.' Morning coffee: 'Is butchness now a measure of growth?' What is that to do with the price of runways? Is Cameron calling the Labour leader gay? Is it something to do with public-school fagging? Is butchness now a measure of growth, for, if so, Cameron is Queen Bitch. It's depressing, though, as halfway through the Coalition Government, we don't know what Cameron is for - except cuts, centralisation (education) and privatisation (health). Labour has to now punch home what it is for, not simply oppose cuts. And who really cares any more what the Lib Dems are for? After the display of values this country truly treasures at the Olympics, we come back to this? Booing is mild compared with the political comedown we are facing. Those born to rule have no idea how to actually do so. This reshuffle is a retreat - forget modernisation and cuddly Tories. However many glass houses are built, stones will be thrown. Michelle Obama is an incredible figure. Literally - arms, legs, the works. She has it all. She hugs meaningfully, laughs sexily and is a fine orator. The speech she gave at the Democrats' convention was a reminder that she and Barack embody the American dream. They knew poverty and they had been young, in love and in debt. But why do wives have to make these speeches at all? It is political infantilisation of the highest order. American dream: 'Michelle Obama is an incredible figure - she has it all' I always thought it was dreadful when they made Sarah Brown tell us she loved her husband at the Labour Party Conference. Is this what women are for? To humanise men? Last week, though, it was of course Bill Clinton's speech that was more powerful, as the old goat reminded Americans of better economic times. I was in the South for the last election, where folk would tell you they couldn't vote for Obama ''cos he is different'. The chat-show hosts focused their out-and-out racism on Michelle in particular. Yes, this 'uppity woman' does represent what America can be - but her sweet talk cannot remove the fact America is still a very divided nation. I do try with The Great British Bake Off, but it's another world to me. This is not helped by my youngest chanting 'No one cares' all the way through. Like her mother, she tends to the view that cake is to be eaten, not filmed. But I do see one must have reached a kind of state of Zen enlightenment when the biggest worry you have is 'wet fruit' or 'poor marbling' in a tart/pie/cake situation. Huge whoops in my house when Jonnie Peacock powered to victory. He lost his leg at five to meningococcal septicaemia. One of my children had that and we were told to expect the worst. Proud: Jonnie Peacock won gold in the Men's 100m - T44 Final at the Paralympics . The worst didn't happen. Paediatric intensive care is the NHS at it finest. But ever since then, I have heard from people, like Peacock, who have lost limbs or hearing and gone on to all kinds of great things. Doctors are closer than ever to a vaccine for this terrible illness. I will be celebrating his medal with a donation to the Meningitis Research Foundation (meningitis.org). Do join me. Prince Harry is more popular than ever since those naked pictures. Let’s hope no other Royals embrace this strategy. We now see why he was partying, as he is going back to Afghanistan. I wish no soldiers harm but this is mission impossible. Why is he going? Why are any of our young men and women still going? Why?","'It's depressing as halfway through the Coalition Government, we don't know what Cameron is for'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 14:31 EST, 24 May 2012 . A former high school teacher accused of having sex with a 17-year-old student has taken a plea deal to avoid prison. Lauren Redfern, 26, pleaded guilty yesterday to a felony charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. The plea is not an admission to having a sexual relationship with the male student who attended Basalt High School outside of Aspen, Colorado. Scroll down for video . Allegation: Lauren Redfern, 25, turned herself in to authorities after she was allegedly discovered in the bathroom having sex with one of her students . The illicit affair between the physical education teacher and her student was unearthed when the two were found allegedly having sex in the school bathroom of the teacher’s office on February 9. Redfern does not face prison time and she will not be added to the sexual-offender registry, Eagle County District Attorney Mark Hurlbert told the Aspen Times. The plea agreement still needs final approval from a district judge and a sentencing hearing was set for June 26. Redfern is likely to be place on probation for two years and a protection order remained in place to prevent contact with her former student. Without the deal, she could have faced anywhere from four to 16 years in prison and the Class Three felony charge of two counts sexual assault on a child by one in a position of trust. She no longer works as a teacher and was training to become a cross-fit instructor. The athletic director of Basalt High School outside of Aspen, Colorado, reportedly found 26-year-old Lauren Redfern and one of her male students engaged in a sexual act, an affidavit stated. High school: Redfern graduated from Basalt High School in 2004 and was a star of the basketball team . Redfern, who graduated from the high school in 2004 and was a star basketball player in her day, turned herself into the Eagle County Sheriff’s Office in February, and was charged with sexual assault on a child by a person in position of trust. Redfern had been the teen’s study hall teacher. Though the student is of-age now, their affair had started when the boy was a minor, the sheriff’s office said. Eagle County Undersheriff Mike McWilliam said ‘the juvenile and teacher had sexual conduct at her house and at his house.’ The alleged affair is believed to have lasted for three to four months. Per Colorado state law, a 17-year-old can have a sexual relationship with an adult of any age as long as it is consensual. However, the latter cannot be considered a person of trust. Mr McWilliam told MailOnline that a person of trust is 'anybody who would be responsible for care -  namely, we use it for teachers.' He added: ‘If she weren’t a teacher, it wouldn’t be a criminal act.' Hearing: Redfern appeared in court in February after handing herself into police over the alleged affair with a teenage student . In the affidavit, she said that the relationship with the student was ‘unintentional.’ The two began exchanging flattering texts last fall, the documents show. By Christmas, ‘they both felt attracted to one another,’ it read. Redfern told authorities that the relationship began when the student was over at her house in Eagle County watching a movie. During the film, the two kissed and touched each other, but nothing more happened, the affidavit said. The student called Redford for assistance with a school paper two weeks later, the document stated. He then went over to her house for help, where the two allegedly had sexual intercourse. The couple had sex at least five times after that, Redfern told authorities – both when he was underage and after he turned 18. The student also met with authorities, telling them that he pursued his teacher romantically and that they shared similar interests, according to the affidavit.","Lauren Redfern, 26, pleaded guilty to 'contributing to delinquency of a minor' - NOT an admission of having a sexual relationship .

'I saw my parents kill my sister': The sister of Shafelia Ahmed (pictured) told police she saw her parents kill the teenager by forcing a bag into her mouth and suffocating her, a court heard . The younger sister of a schoolgirl allegedly murdered for defying her strict Muslim parents claims she saw her father stuff a carrier bag into her mouth and suffocate her, a court heard yesterday. Shafilea Ahmed, 17, was 'physically abused' virtually every day, her sister Alesha said, after her parents discovered she was living a 'secret life' they did not approve of. On the night she died, she was wearing white stiletto-heeled boots and had red dye in her hair in defiance of her parents, the court heard. The teenager was allegedly killed for dishonouring the family by failing to go through an arranged marriage and insisting on pursuing a Westernised lifestyle. Yesterday the trial of Iftikhar Ahmed, 52, and his wife Farzana, 49, heard the 'bombshell' disclosure from her younger sister Alesha – who gave evidence from behind a screen – about the violence Shafilea allegedly suffered at their hands in the run-up to her death. The court was told that Alesha, who was 15 at the time, witnessed the fatal attack on her sister in September 2003. But she did not give police the 'final piece of the puzzle' until seven years later after being arrested over a robbery at the family home during which her mother, surviving sisters and brother were tied up. Six days later, she alleged to police that her parents had killed Shafilea. Yesterday Andrew Edis, QC, prosecuting, said Alesha, who is on witness protection and awaiting sentence for robbery, 'hasn't received any promises or indeed any inducement prior to when she first made these allegations. 'She now finds herself estranged from the family as a result of what she has said. Her life has turned upside down because of what she has said and what she has done.' Alesha described how her parents suffocated Shafilea with 'a carrier bag forced into her mouth and then hands over her face to close her airways so she could not breathe', Mr Edis said. Alesha then saw their mother in the kitchen 'sorting through a pile of blankets and sheets' and holding a roll of black bin bags and two rolls of tape, the jury was told. Accused of murder: Shafelia's mother Farzana Ahmed, left, and Iftikhar Ahmed, right, at Chester Crown Court . 'After that had happened she looked out the window and saw her father with a large object wrapped in bin bags with brown tape around it.' Shortly afterwards, she saw her father leaving in a car with Shafilea's body – she assumes – inside, Mr Edis added. Shafilea had only just started college to study for her A-levels after hospital treatment for deliberately swallowing bleach while staying with her grandparents in rural Pakistan, the court has heard. On the night Alesha claims her parents killed her sister at the family home in Warrington, Cheshire, Shafilea had been picked up by her mother from her evening call centre job, the court was told. She had been dressed in Western clothing in defiance of her parents' desire for her to wear traditional dress, Mr Edis told Chester Crown Court. The following day, Alesha allegedly told friends her father had killed Shafilea and chopped up her body, although she afterwards denied saying it. 'Killing': Shafilea Ahmed's family home in Warrington, Cheshire . However her parents did not report her missing, and the alarm was only raised a week later by an ex-teacher worried about rumours of what had happened. By contrast, when Shafilea ran away before the trip to Pakistan, they had repeatedly called her mobile and contacted her friends in a bid to find her, Mr Edis said. Shafilea's decomposing but intact remains were found on an isolated riverbank 100 miles away in the Lake District five months after she vanished. The court has been told analysis of the scene suggests she was dumped there shortly after she was allegedly murdered. Shafilea Ahmed was drugged by her mother before being put on what was meant to be a one-way trip to Pakistan, the court was told. Her younger sister Alesha described listening from the stairs on the morning of the flight as an intoxicating drink known as a 'nasha' was mixed before Farzana took it to Shafilea's bedroom. 'My mum told my sister she'd brought a drink for her,' she told the jury. 'I think she just thought my mum was being nice. She drank it all.' The whole family then travelled to Manchester Airport where Alesha said her sister seemed 'slow', 'agreed with everything' and had to lean on a luggage trolley. While Shafilea remained conscious on the flight, in February 2003, it was only after a night's sleep at her grandfather's home in Pakistan that it dawned on her what had happened, she said. Their father threatened to shoot Shafilea if she made a scene, Alesha told the jury. 'He just said to her, ""There is a gun back there, no one would ever know if anything happened to you"".' Earlier the jury heard it may be significant that Mr Ahmed had shortly beforehand been prescribed sleeping tablets. The court has been told Shafilea had run away from home on several occasions. Alesha told the jury that after the last incident, she and her brother and other sisters all suspected that her parents were planning to send her to Pakistan for good. 'When Pakistani families have problems with their children, they feel that taking them to Pakistan will somehow sort the child out,' she said. But she insisted there had been no talk of an arranged marriage for Shafilea at that stage, although 'there were people who wanted to marry her'. However, in what the prosecution claim was an act of desperation in the face of being pushed into marrying and staying in Pakistan, Shafilea drank a bottle of bleach, causing severe damage to her throat. She was flown home to England for treatment. The prosecution dismisses claims by her parents that she had mistaken the bottle for mouthwash during a power cut. Alesha, now 23, yesterday gave evidence about the daily clashes between Shafilea and her parents. Points of conflict with her parents included spending time with white friends, her use of her mobile phone 'and just generally the clothes she was wearing', she said. She said Shafilea liked to dress in a 'Western way', wearing jeans, T-shirts and 'pedal pushers' rather than the traditional Pakistani outfits her parents wanted. As a result, Shafilea was subjected to physical abuse. Asked about the frequency, Alesha said: 'Too often from what I can remember – pretty much every day, or every other day, even if it was arguments or little slaps here and there.' There was also more serious violence, she added. Alesha described an incident when her sister sat on the floor of the kitchen while both their parents used knives 'to scare her and threaten her'. She said: 'They were just hitting her, it was quite frantic.' Shafilea 'was just sat there, taking  it, really'. On other occasions, she said, Shafilea would be locked in a spare room and not given food for days at a time for disobeying her parents. Tragic: Shafilea had been a keen student at her school in Warrington, Cheshire, and enjoyed trips to shopping centres and wearing Western clothes . Another point of friction was when Shafilea was surreptitiously in touch with boys, she said. 'I think that was when the abuse was worst, when they found out about her being in the company of males. I don't think they wanted other people to know she was doing that.' Asked about her parents' religion, Alesha said they were Muslims but said they only really practised the faith after Shafilea's death. Stressing that her parents' values were more about Pakistani traditions than Islamic teachings, she told the court: 'Western culture is a lot more free in terms of the times you can go out, friends you can keep, clothes you can wear – it's very different.' She described Pakistani cultural traditions as being 'restrictive' as to what was expected of Shafilea and her sisters. She added: 'I think because my dad was working more, it was  for my mum to lay down the rules in a sense.' The trial also heard details of conversations between the Ahmeds following Shafilea's disappearance recorded after police bugged the family home. Transcripts show they discussed the possibility that they were under surveillance as well as whether police analysis of their cars would reveal where they had been driven. On one occasion, the jury were told, Mr Ahmed is heard saying 'even if there is saliva in the car it's not as though she didn't sit in the car'. On another, Mr Ahmed tells his wife the legal system in Britain requires proof, and that without it, even if you killed 40 people, 'until it is found, they can't do anything to you'. Mr Edis said given that Shafilea's body hadn't been found at that stage, it was 'rather odd' that  her parents should be talking in those terms if they were innocent of her murder. The trial has heard that Shafilea's death remained a mystery until a breakthrough in 2010 when Alesha was arrested over a robbery at the family home and told of witnessing her killing. Mr Edis told the jury would have to decide whether this crime – which she has admitted being involved in – had 'released the blockage' preventing her telling the truth, or if she had made up her account to protect herself. 'Either she's telling the truth, or it's a wicked lie made up to help herself,' Mr Edis added. The couple both deny murder and the case continues.

"By . Lucy Laing . UPDATED: . 08:07 EST, 26 November 2011 . This is the girl who has made a remarkable recovery after going from obese to anorexic. Going from fat to thin nearly killed Alice Vinall - after she lost a staggering 11 stone in a bid to shed her bulk. She embarked on a strict diet after doctors told her she may suffer serious future health problems because of her massive weight. So she existed on one small meal a . day but her obsessive diet went too far and she became gripped by the . eating disorder anorexia. Overweight to underweight: When 5ft 9 Alice Vinall was diagnosed with anorexia (left) she weighed just over seven stone - an 11 stone weight loss from when she was obese (right) She . was finally admitted to an eating disorders clinic weighing just seven . stone and spent 18 months being treated at the clinic. She . has now made a full recovery and weighs a healthy 11 stone - but she . wants her story to prove a stark warning to other young women. Miss Vinall, 25, said: ‘Being fat nearly killed me, but being too thin was even more deadly. Now I’m just happy to be alive. ‘I want to show people that losing too much weight can be dangerous. Anorexia is a dangerous disease that can kill.’ Miss . Vinall, who is single and lives in Ware, Hertfordshire, had started . putting on weight after her 18th birthday, and by the time she reached . 21 she weighed 18 stone 13. She . said: ‘I was always out drinking and eating with my friends, and I . would eat all the wrong things. I had a lot of takeaways and fast food, . and alcoholic sugary drinks. . Warned to lose weight: Alice shot up to nearly 19st at her heaviest while living a lifestyle of binging and partying . ‘I started putting on weight and before I . knew it I weighed nearly 19 stone. I was young and didn’t really think . about what I was doing. I was just concentrating on having a good time . with my friends . ‘I’d never had a problem with my weight before. At school I’d been good at sport and had been slim like all the other pupils.’ But when Miss Vinall visited her doctor, she was told that she must lose some weight, otherwise she was going to face future health problems such as heart disease and diabetes. She said: ‘When I went to see the doctor I was shocked. I knew that I was overweight, but she told me that the health problems I may face could be life threatening to me. I knew realised that my weight was actually a danger to me. ‘That night I went home and looked hard in the mirror and was shocked by what I saw. I had got this big and now I knew I needed to do something about it. Healthy medium: Now Alice is a healthy 11 stone after checking into a special eating disorders unit . 'I was fatter than all of my friends . and I couldn’t shop in the high street shops as they didn’t stock . anything big enough for me.’ So Miss Vinall joined a local slimming group and embarked on a strict diet. Instead . of gorging daily on MacDonalds burgers and steak and chips, she instead . ate chicken and salad and low calorie microwave meals. The pounds started to fall off her, much to her delight. She said: ‘The first week when I went back to the slimming club I had lost half a stone and I felt a rush of satisfaction. I knew that I could do it.’ But as the months went by she lost more and more weight. Soon she was existing on just one slice of bread and a small low calorie microwave meal each day. She said: ‘Because I wasn’t eating I just felt exhausted all the time and I found it difficult to cope with my job as a nanny. ‘Yet I would come home and spend an hour and a half running on the treadmill, trying to lose even more pounds. ‘My periods stopped because of my swift weight loss and mum and dad were so worried about my weight that dad even offered to pay me if I would put some weight back on.’ Miss Vinall stopped going to the slimming club and by 2009 her weight had dropped to a dangerously low 7 stone 13. Miss Vinall, a pre-school manager, said: ‘I went to see the doctor as I was worried about my periods stopping as I really wanted to be a mum. The doctor told me that at 5ft9, I was dangerously underweight.’ The GP diagnosed her with anorexia and referred her to an eating disorders clinic for treatment. She was treated for 18 months and is now back up 11 stone, which is a healthy weight for her height. She said: ‘When I came out of the clinic I smashed the bathroom scales with a hammer and mum sold my running machine. ‘I was determined that I wouldn’t ever be obsessed about losing weight again as it became a dangerous obsession for me. ‘I have forced myself to keep eating and now I’m a healthy weight. It’s still tough but I try not to think about my weight too much. ‘Being fat nearly killed me as I could have suffered from life threatening problems, but being thin was worse. I was happier at 19 stone than I was at seven stone, but I’m just so thankful that I was treated in time and I’m still alive. ‘I feel very lucky and now I’m living my life to the full - and my weight is what it should be.’","Alice Vinall went from nearly 19st to just over 7st after being told by doctors she would suffer serious health problems from her massive weight .

Dog owners whose pets harm others should be jailed for at least six months, according to strict new guidelines. The Sentencing Council said the tougher punishments follow a rise in convictions for dangerous dog offences. Its updated rules set a standard of six months in prison for anyone in charge of a dog which is  dangerously out of control and injures a person or other animal. Bite: News rules mean six months in prison for anyone in charge of a dog which is dangerously out of control and injures a person or other animal . The most serious cases, such as repeated attacks or where the victim is a child or elderly, should be punished more severely, with 18 months in jail. However, courts were free to ‘use more severe sentences when appropriate,’ said the council, which sets advice for judges and magistrates. The new rules also suggest that owners who let their dogs run dangerously out of control should face six months in jail even if no one is injured. DOMINIQUE JACKSON: . 'Let us hope that judges and magistrates . across the country read and digest the new sentencing guidelines and use . them as effectively as they are able, to put the owners of seriously . dangerous dogs behind bars for a period long enough to be a serious . deterrent' Read more here . Under the much-criticised Dangerous Dogs Act 1991, the maximum term remains at two years. Anne Arnold, a district judge and council member, said: ‘Most dog owners are responsible and take good care of their pets. 'But we have seen more and more cases of owners who have put the public at risk or let their dogs cause injuries,  sometimes very serious.’ There was a 39 per cent rise in the number of people sentenced for dangerous dog crimes in just a year, up from 855 in 2009 to 1,192 in 2010. The number of dog bites reported at A&E departments has nearly doubled in a decade, reaching 6,097 in the year to April 2011. The guidelines also urge the courts to use powers to put down dangerous animals, ban offenders from keeping dogs and to compensate victims. Ministers are working on a consultation paper on the best way to control dangerous dogs, including an option to micro-chip all puppies. The Dogs Trust and Blue Cross animal charities welcomed the tougher sentences. However, the Blue Cross also called for new laws to target irresponsible owners to prevent attacks happening.","Sentencing Council acts following rise in convictions for dangerous dog offences .

A grandfather lost so much weight whilst being treated by the NHS, that staff failed to recognise him from a photograph his wife left on his bedside table. Retired engineer John Thorpe, 88, shed five stone in just five weeks after being admitted to a care home and hospital following a fall in his back garden. By the time he died following treatment at Royal Bolton Hospital in Bolton, Greater Manchester, the grandfather-of-four had developed pressure sores due to being bedbound and was said to look like a 'shadow of his former self.' Tragedy: John and Nora Thorpe on their 40th wedding anniversary. Hospital staff were unable to recognise the retired engineer in this photo after he shed five stone in just five weeks following a fall in his back garden . Now after nearly a year of wrangling NHS bosses have apologised to Mr Thorpe’s family after admitting some of its work practises while he was being treated were 'inadequate and lacking.' Mr Thorpe had been enjoying an active life regularly walking the dog and would love taking trips abroad with his wife Nora - hill-climbing in Austria, and enjoying the cultures of Germany, Spain and Portugal. But in February last year he accidentally stumbled and fell as he was pottering in the garden of the home he shared with his wife in Great Lever, Bolton. After treatment at Royal Bolton Hospital, Mr Thorpe was advised to undergo a six-week physiotherapy course at Darley Court, an intermediate care home run by the trust, because his damaged knee saw him struggling to get out of his armchair. But within weeks he developed painful pressure sores and became bed-bound while he was treated by Trust staff. He was sent back to Royal Bolton Hospital to a complex care ward because he was unwell. Grieving: Nora Thorpe, 86, holds a picture of her late husband John. The hospital has accepted there was inadequate . communication with Mr Thorpe and his family during his time in its care last year . Nora, 86, said: 'I had brought in a photograph of us to sit by John’s bed to cheer him up. A member of staff was chatting to him and asked who was in the photo. John said ""it’s me"" and the man didn’t believe him. 'He looked so different because he’d lost so much weight. He wasn’t a person who liked having to rely on people, so it was frustrating to see him so helpless. 'He would just have to lie there and look about him. He was deteriorating and I could see in his eyes it was as though he didn’t have anything to live for.' The couple’s son Gordon, 58, said the family were not kept informed about deterioration in his father’s condition and said notes and documents relating to his care were not completed properly. Fall: Mr Thorpe when he was 58 and an Officer in the Bolton Sea Cadets . He said: 'When my father went in for treatment, he was mobile but he came out on a stretcher and was taken back to hospital with two pressure sores that went through to the bone. After that he never got out of bed again. 'I wish he hadn’t gone in for physiotherapy in the first place - maybe he would still be here today. He was still getting about, he was struggling a bit because of his knee but he was still getting around the house. 'They were obviously giving him the . wrong diet because he had never suffered that in his life. When I saw . him being lifted into the ambulance he looked just awful - they said it . could be touch and go whether he’d make it through the night. 'We . were never kept in the know about the problems he was having - the lack . of paperwork and lack of communication between staff and relatives was . disgraceful. 'The complex care ward was a shambles and a joke. There was not enough staff to cover all the patients. 'Staff . put him on a liquid diet because he was unable to swallow because of . dementia. But he hated the food - it was all mushed up and disgusting so . he didn’t eat it. 'They . didn’t help him in any way, he would eat the bananas and yoghurts we . would take in for him. He lost around five stones, he was so weak. But . yet it was the mushed food or nothing.' Eventually . a doctor told his family that no more could be done for Mr Thorpe’s . sores because the septicaemia had gone so deep, it was down to the bone - . and the pensioner was discharged to go home. He died the following . October. Gordon said: 'I . asked the doctor why on earth he developed the sores in the first place . and he turned to me and said, ""if you don’t like the care then why don’t . you pay to put him in a home."" 'He . also said the NHS was in a shambles because ""some people in this room . may not be paying their taxes"". We were shocked - he spoke to us like . utter dirt. 'The fact is my . father wasn’t being monitored or anything because staff weren’t . updating his notes properly. It was heart-breaking to see my dad suffer . like that. We had our trust in the professionals, only for them to fail. 'The . NHS keep promising they will get things right, but they’re not. When . mistakes are made in hospital, people’s lives are at risk.' The . cash strapped hospital is at the centre of an investigation after it . emerged it had 'lost' £3.8m in accounting bungles. This week the . hospital’s director of finance resigned. Sores: Mr Thorpe died following treatment at Royal . Bolton Hospital in Bolton, Greater Manchester, where he . had developed pressure sores due to being bedbound and was said to look . like a 'shadow of his former self' Dee Sissons, Director of Patient Experience and Safety/Chief Nurse at Royal Bolton Hospital said: 'I fully accept that there was inadequate communication with Mr Thorpe and his family during his father’s time in our care last year and unacceptable delays in sending him reports into his subsequent complaints. 'Some patients have complex health conditions which mean they are particularly at risk of developing pressure sores. 'We use risk assessments, provide special pressure relieving mattresses and cushions and where needed turn patients frequently to minimise these risks. 'However, in some patients it can be very difficult to minimise all these risks and prevent pressure sores occurring. 'In the case of Mr Thorpe’s father we believe that overall appropriate care was given however the documentation to give evidence of what had been done was sometimes lacking.'","John Thorpe shed five stone in just five weeks after being admitted to a care home and hospital after a fall .

My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding star Josie McFayden stepped into the public spotlight today for the first time since announcing her decision to divorce from husband Swanley Smith. The duo, who were the first couple to marry on the hit TV show in front of 6.5million viewers two years ago, split amid a string of fights and blazing rows. Just last month when the separation came to light she threatened to burn her five-stone net and diamante wedding gown, but today at the ITV studios in London she remained calm and composed. Calm and composed: Josie McFadyen pictured outside the ITV studios . Sporting highlighted tresses and red lipstick the 18-year-old told This Morning presenters Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby: 'No, I would never burn it, my mummy and . my daddy got me that dress and that something they didn’t know was going . to not work out, it’s not their fault, it’s not the dress's fault, . it’s Swanley’s fault.' 'At the time I was really angry with Swanley.' Ms McFayden was just 16 when she married Swanley in an enormous . frilly white frock followed by a team of bridesmaids dressed in hot pink . in a ceremony in July 2010. Now after less than two years of marriage and the birth of a daughter, Josie, 18, is planning a divorce from her husband. Lavish affair: Swanley and Josie Smith married in an extravagant ceremony when she was just 16, in front of 6.5million viewers . Rocky relationship: The pair split after less than two years of marriage following constant fights . Josie has moved out of the couple's caravan and is living in a house in Middlesex with their eight-month-old child, also called Josie, and her mother. Josie previously told how she was 'swept off her feet' by Swanley, 21, who she met on a social networking site six months before they married in her dream fairytale wedding. But she revealed that cracks started to appear just days after the wedding and accused Swanley of 'bullying her.' She said: 'Obviously every girl wants to get married… but it just never worked out for me it was a nightmare from day one. 'I think things changed and I got to know the real him. It was like he was putting on this big lie. 'He’d stop me from seeing my mum and my brothers and sister. He would just call them names. 'Physically he put me down in myself... I didn’t want to be bullied I still wanted to be treated fair.' No holds barred: Guests typically dress to impress in the traveller weddings featured on the hit programme . Big day: Josie's little brother John McFadyen, 18, after saying his vows on the show to Cheyenne Pidgley, 16, who he met at his sister's wedding reception . In response Swanley said: 'How can Josie feel bullied when she had the freedom to do what she wanted. If she wanted to go out with friends then it didn’t bother me.' Josie said she tried to make the marriage work as the travelling community frowns upon divorce and believe that the family comes before anything else. She admitted that 'in her world' the man comes first and wives are expected to obey. But the final straw came when she discovered Swanley had secretly spent their savings. The couple received a £105,000 compensation payment from Surrey County Council after they were forced to leave the site where they were living in Caterham when it was declared contaminated. But Josie claimed she didn't see any of the money while her husband gave half to his family and spent the rest buying himself X Box games and a £13,000 Rolex watch. She revealed that Swanley hasn't been to visit his daughter since the couple split but she hopes he will still play a part in her life. Josie admitted that after her own experience she hopes her daughter won't get married until she's in her twenties. 'I did get married too young. I thought I was ready but I think I was more in love with being in love.' She added that she knows many other travelling couples who married young and are still very happy, including her brother John McFadyen who met his wife Cheyenne at her own wedding.

A girl who fell pregnant at the age of 11 and became Britain’s youngest mother is expecting her second child. Tressa Middleton from Bathgate, West Lothian, now aged 18, was forced to give up her toddler for adoption two years after giving birth in 2006. The decision came after she revealed the baby was born as the result of a rape by her own brother. Britain's youngest mother, Tressa Middleton is now pregnant with her second child . Although Tressa spent several years addicted to drugs and alcohol after quitting school, she says she has now . turned her life around and is ready to be a mother. She . is in a relationship with her fiance, trainee mechanic Darren, 25, who . she lives with, and she has announced that she is two months’ pregnant. Tressa told Closer magazine: 'I did not want to give up my daughter, but I was too young to be a mum. 'I feel ready now. My daughter can’t be replaced, but this is a second chance.' She . discovered she was pregnant first time round in 2005 and at first . claimed a local boy was the father to protect her mother, Tracey . Tallons, 39. After giving birth she describes that she never stopped the 'fags and drink', and soon spiralled out of control under the very noses of her social . workers. She ended up in a residential unit, . rather than with her child and it seemed inevitable that the authorities . were always going to take . Tressa's baby away . Unsettling: Pictures taken of Tressa Middleton soon after the birth in 2006 . When she was 14, she revealed that her twisted brother Jason was the father of her child. And when it came out, her family fell apart in the . event, and Tressa was left to sign papers authorising the adoption. 'I signed the papers because I knew I would lose in court and they . would take her from me anyway. This way I thought I would get visitation . rights.' In 2009 Jason Middleton was jailed for four years and has now been released and lives at home with his mother. He was 16 when the attack happened, at the family home in West Lothian, five years older than his sister. She says the rape was not a one-off, but part of a wider pattern of abuse. Talking about her daughter Tressa says: 'I would have given my life for her'  -  but it was a complex relationship. There were times I looked at her and I saw my brother Jason in her . face. That made it hard. But I still loved her, with all . my heart.' Tressa says that she and Darren, who had both experimented with heroin, have both been weaned off it after receiving support from a drug centre. She says she was jubilant when doctors confirmed her pregnancy. 'I was so excited and Darren was over the moon, too,' she said. 'I can’t wait to buy clothes and decorate a nursery for when the baby arrives.' Tressa, who sends her adopted child Christmas and birthday cards and gifts, added: 'My daughter is six now and at school. I plan to tell baby about their big sister. If I have a girl, she will take her name as a middle name.

A woman who intervened when two fellow officers were allegedly assaulting an 'emotionally disturbed' young man, will find out in the next few days if she will be sacked. Officer Regina Tasca in the Bogota Police Department, New Jersey, has been suspended since the incident last April -  the hearing in front of a retired judge started on Tuesday. When Officer Tasca, an 11-year veteran with numerous commendations, responded to a call in April 2011, she clicked her unit dashboard camera on. Breaking it up: This photo was taken by the young man's distraught mother as she begged the policemen to stop hurting her son. Officer Regina Tasca is seen her trying to pull one of the men off - it was this intervention which may cost her, her job . She did not realise she was about to capture a mother, screaming for police to stop punching her son outside her home on their front lawn, reported Pix 11.com. The mother - who is thought to be a councilwoman - had called emergency services to help take her son Kyle, 22, to hospital -  he is reported to have 'emotional issues.' Officer Tasca was the only officer in the area on that day, so she called for back-up, which is part of response protocol and Ridgefield Park Police then sent the two officers. In limbo: Officer Regina Tasca in the Bogota Police Department, has been suspended since the incident last April - she is an 11-year veteran with numerous commendations . Officer Tasca said one of the officers charged at the young man and she was 'quite shocked.' 'As he's doing that, another Ridgefield Park officer flies to . the scene in his car, jumps out and starts punching him in the head,' she added. On the tape you can hear Tara, the mother, and Kyle, her son, screaming, ""Why are you punching him?"" and ""Stop punching me!"", reported the website. Kyle's mother was so disturbed by the incident that she took a photo of Officer Tasca, seemingly pulling the two officers off her son. Recorded: Photographs from the hospital documenting the bruises on the 22-year-old's head, back, arms and wrists . Kyle was not charged or arrested for an offence - Officer Tasca says this is because he did not threaten anyone and did not have a weapon. She says he was not violent and did not even attempt to resist during the incident. Officer Tasca says she was eventually successful in yanking the Ridgefield Park policeman off Kyle. 'If another officer is using . excessive force, it's my duty to make sure you stop it. and that's what I . did,' says Officer Tasca about her actions. The hospital took several photos documenting the extensive bruises on the 22-year-old's body including his head, back, arms and wrists. Disturbing: The black-and-white tape captures a mother, screaming for police to stop punching her son on their front lawn . Officer Tasca said when she met her superior officer after the incident she was asked to hand in her weapon and was told she would be sent for a fitness for duty exam. Bogota Police suspended Officer Tasca and the website reports that after hearing her story, they were concerned she was psychologically incompetent to be a police officer. But the two officers in the video have . not been interviewed by an Internal Affairs Investigator, and are still . working the streets today, reported Pix11.com. Case: After hearing Officer Tasca's story, Bogota PD, believes she is psychologically incompetent to be a police officer, and she is being sent for testing . Tasca's attorney Catherine Elston said: This was excessive force used against an emotionally disturbed person.' 'This was an unlawful tackle, this was . a punching an emotionally disturbed person whose arms were pinned under . his chest with his face pushed into the ground,' she added. Kyle's mother later called her and said on Officer Tasca's answering machine: 'Thank . you Regina. I appreciate you standing up for him, for protecting him . while the officer attacked him. I can't figure out what I would have . done without you at the scene.' Raymond Wiss, who represented the borough in a disciplinary hearing, said Officer Tasca’s termination is warranted based on two incidents in April 2011 — one at Holy Name Medical Center, in which she is accused of failing to assist a fellow officer who was attacked by a drunken woman, and the incident with the two Ridgefield Park officers.","Officer Regina Tasca from the Bogota Police Department, New Jersey, has been suspended since the incident last April .

"By . Lauren Paxman . UPDATED: . 12:14 EST, 23 January 2012 . Speedy cure: Lorry driver Leslie Lloyd has had an Endobarrier fitted and his weight has dropped dramatically . A pioneering alternative to a gastric band operation - which takes just 15 minutes to put in place - is being trialed in London. The Endobarrier is a balloon-type device, taken orally, which lines the intestine and prevents food from being absorbed. It is designed to help dangerously overweight patients who are unlikely to be able to cope with the trauma of gastric surgery. Researchers at Imperial College . Healthcare say that the treatment has so far been a big success. The procedure is not currently available on the NHS but the . first patients to receive an Endobarrier are shedding weight without . experiencing the potentially debilitating side-effects of a major . operation. Lorry . driver Leslie Lloyd has had an Endobarrier fitted. His diet of bacon . rolls - bought in roadside cafes during lengthy journeys - caused his . weight to balloon to 18 stone. Lloyd was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, a condition which kills three people an hour in the UK. But he has now lost almost three stone and his sugar levels have dropped from a dangerous 16.9 to a more healthy 7.1. Mr Lloyd, from Crawley, told the BBC London’s Inside Out: 'I’ve tried dieting but unfortunately with the lifestyle that I lead on the truck it’s so easy to stop at snack wagons and get a bacon roll, packet of crisps or chocolate bar.' Loose weight fast: The balloon-like Endobarrier lines the intestine preventing food from being absorbed . If his diabetes had reached the point where he needed to be treated with insulin, he would have lost his HGV licence. The Endobarrier will stay in place for up to a year before being removed. However Mr Lloyd’s diabetes is expected to go into remission within a few weeks. He said: 'Now I feel a lot better in . myself, I’m not so lethargic and more active. I can go out and go on . walks and I’m not tired all the time. I feel 100 per cent better. I’m . very happy, and the weight loss is a bonus.' The weight loss aid takes just 15 minutes to put in place and is perfect for those who cannot cope with the trauma of a gastric operation . A clip from tonight's episode of Inside Out shows the Endobarrier being put in place . While the Endobarrier is not as effective as a gastric bypass, it will benefit those who cannot be exposed to the risks of surgery - a common problem for overweight patients. In 2009, almost a quarter of adults in England were classed as obese and if nothing is done to slow down the proportion of obese people, the figure will rise 40 per cent by 2030. Obese people are 80 times more likely to develop Type 2 diabetes. Professor Nadey Hakim, surgical director of the West London Transplant Unit at Hammersmith Hospital, said: 'Here we have a procedure which is simple. It takes 15 minutes, there is no incision and amazingly it does improve if not cure Type 2 diabetics.' Inside Out is on BBC1 at 7.30pm tonight.","The Endobarrier is installed orally and lines the intestine, preventing food from being absorbed ."
"Tracey Bennett is forced to drag herself around the flat after she was given a home too narrow for her wheelchair .

PUBLISHED: . 12:55 EST, 27 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 13:33 EST, 27 April 2012 . A disabled woman who is a virtual prisoner in her own home has posted a hard-hitting video highlighting her plight to the housing chiefs who failed to adequately house her. Tracey Bennett, 37, has suffered from Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) since a work-related accident six years ago left her with difficulty walking. In the video posted on YouTube, titled 'Westminster Council’s Shame', the former youth worker demonstrates how she moves around her flat by pulling herself along with her arms and sliding on her legs across the floor. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Plight: Footage from disabled Tracey Bennett's video shows her lying exhausted on the floor after dragging herself by her arms around her flat . She said she rarely eats hot food as she is unable to cook in her kitchen because the work units are too high, and she cannot use her wheelchair on the second floor, council-owned property in Paddington, West London, as it is too wide to fit through doorways. She eats food from a bowl on the floor next to the mattress where she sleeps and is reliant on the kindness of friends or family members, who bring her basic necessities. Ms Bennett is calling on the council to rehouse her in ground-floor accommodation and said she made the video because she is at her 'wit’s end'. The council said that since 2008 Ms Bennett had been on a list allowing her to bid for a housing transfer when new properties became available. Attack: The video which shows Ms Bennett having to slide her way in to the bathroom was filmed to show Westminster Council the conditions she is living in . A spokeswoman said they were working closely with her to try and improve her situation, adding that her care package had been doubled after it became clear last week that her condition had worsened owing to an arm injury. Recounting one period when she said she was left housebound while a new lift was fitted, Ms Bennett said: 'I’ve never committed any crime but I was kept prisoner here. 'I know there are people worse off than me, but I have been trying for three years to get rehoused and I haven’t got anywhere.' There is a chronic shortage of council housing in Westminster, many homes having been hived off under the right-to-buy scheme. Housebound: In the film she is shown having to fill her water bottle up from the bath because she cannot reach the sink in her kitchen . Councillor Rachael Robathan, Westminster Council’s cabinet member for adults and health, said: 'We have made every effort to tackle this situation since Ms Bennett first made us aware of her injury. 'The council agreed to double Ms Bennett’s care package with additional help following a visit from a care manager. 'Ms Bennett first applied to our housing options service in 2008 and is able to bid on properties that become available. She says she has no choice but to sleep on the floor and relies on friends to bring her food because she can't leave her house to shop . 'The position is that she has yet to place a bid. 'This is a very difficult case and we want to make sure that we do everything we can to help Ms Bennett. 'I am pleased that the care team responded immediately when they were notified of her injury and I hope that the extra measures we have put in place in response to this will help her. 'We will continue to work closely with her to make sure that the services she is offered reflect her current needs following her accident. 'Our housing options team will be carrying out a further medical assessment based on the new information we now have.'","Tracey Bennett is forced to drag herself around the flat after she was given a home too narrow for her wheelchair .

As supermodel who has posed naked numerous times, Kate Moss is well positioned to judge when too much flesh is unacceptable. The catwalk super star has given out fashion advice to British females by urging them to stop flashing so much skin during summer. The 38-year-old thinks that Britons do not how to dress properly when the sun comes out because they are not used to it. Speaking to Grazia magazine she said: 'When you're driving down the road in the summer, the English people... It's not our natural thing, no. So it's 'put it awaaaaaay!' Cutting-edge couple: The supermodel, pictured last night wearing a sheer black dress and matching nail polish, thinks British women dress badly in summer because they aren't used to the heat . Despite her stark warning, Kate has . revealed that her guitarist husband Jamie Hince 'would go mental if she . dressed like a wife'. The . couple live together in north London with Kate's nine-year-old daughter . Lila, from her relationship with Jefferson Hack, but they are still a . long way from boring. Kate admitted that 43-year-old Jamie, one half of band The Kills with Alison Mosshart, 'likes me when I'm a rock 'n' roll kind of girl'. Kate certainly has the credentials - having dated wayward Libertines star Pete Doherty and found notoriety for her reported wild partying. Revealing: The 38-year-old mother refuses to tone down her outfits, heading out on the town last night in a clinging dress that left little to the imagination . She has frequently been the subject of controversy - particularly since many have claimed her drinking, smoking and late nights have begun to ravage her looks - but her laidback attitude suggests she does not care. Bedtime: Kate looked a little worse for wear as her husband followed her out of the club . Despite her claim that there are 'things she can't wear' as she has grown older, she could not pinpoint something that she would say 'never' to, she told Grazia magazine during a rare interview. But she admitted that she would trust her husband to speak up if she 'went a bit far', insisting, 'My husband's pretty good. He is.' The two were married in a glamorous, A-list wedding last July and have recently got a dog, causing some fashion headaches for Kate, because 'you can't walk a dog in a heel. You look ridiculous.' The model, who has branched out with her Topshop range and recently judged Mango's fashion awards, said she tries to be 'a character' when she gets dressed. 'I don't think of it as ""Ooh, it's me"",' she explains. 'I think, ""Who do I want to be?"".' She claims to have some limits however, admitting that she draws the line at clothes that are too short, show too much flesh or have too much colour. The Croydon-born star says that her worst wardrobe malfunctions involve forgetting to do up zips - and indeed she was seen out in London leaving Mexican restaurant La Bodega Negra last month with her flies undone. Although she says she 'loves' people trying out the looks she has designed for Topshop and copying her style, she says her one piece of fashion advice to the British public would be to be aware of exposing too much in the summertime. She said: 'When you're driving down the road in the summer, the English people... 'It's not our natural thing, no. So it's ""put it awaaaaaay!"".' But clearly her love affair with fashion will not be disappearing for some time to come. Asked if she has ever denied herself a purchase, she replies, 'Definitely not. 'There's always room.

Kate has moved on from Johnny, Justin from Britney, Mila from Macaulay and Brad from Juliette, . But it's hard to forget your first love - and easy to look back on it wearing rose-tinted spectacles. And now it emerges that one in five Brits - and as many as a quarter of all British men - would like to get back together with their first sweetheart. They are no longer together, but Kate Moss and Johnny Depp, left, dated for four years during the Nineties, and Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears vowed to stay together forever after meeting on the Mickey Mouse Club TV show in . Some 21 per cent of Brits saying they are secretly planning a reunion with their first lover - and men are most likely to carry a torch for an old flame, with 24 per cent admitting they still lust after a an ex. But it isn't just men. Supermodel Kate Moss, who began a four-year relationship with actor Johnny Depp when she was 21, said, years after their romance was over (but before she met husband Jamie Hince): 'I just haven't found anyone I want to spend long periods with. I don’t think I've completely got over my relationship with Johnny Depp.' As many as fourteen per cent of people have . actually got back in touch with an ex hoping to reignite the passion, . and one in six men are still secretly in contact with a former partner. It seems Londoners are the most likely to deceive their current partner, with 19 per cent of people from the capital lying about being in contact with a former lover - and 100 per cent of those who have made contact say they did so expressly to get back together. People in the Midlands and Scotland are most likely to want to be reunited with their first love (24 per cent), while Scots are the most likely to have attended a school reunion solely to get back with an old flame (10 per cent). Actors Macaulay Culkin and Mila Kunis dated for eight years before she began a relationship with Demi Moore's ex-husband Ashton Kutcher . Although women are less likely to get in contact with an ex, four in ten who do so on the quiet admit they hope to seduce them. Social networking sites have made it easier to find and chat up an ex, with 74 per cent of women using Facebook to link up with an old lover. Men, meanwhile, are much more likely to keep in touch through email (33 per cent) or . text (31 per cent). But psychologists have warned that putting old relationships on an imaginary pedestal and attempting to reignite them is unhealthy and can be emotionally damaging. Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis - here starring in Kalifornia (1993) - dated for three years in the early Nineties, with Lewis allegedly losing her virginity to the latter-day Mr Angelina Jolie . Psychologist Professor Cary Cooper, . of Lancaster University, said: 'Our first love tends to leave a big . emotional imprint. It tends to be a powerful experience and the memory . sticks with us as a reminder of more carefree, uninhibited days. 'We forget the jealousy and the heartbreak and tend to view those days through rose-tinted spectacles. But . it's a mistake to think that 10 or 20 years down the line it could ever . be the same, as our circumstances change and we have greater . responsibilities. 'These . people, particularly men, who pine after their first love are probably . doing so because they're unhappy about something in their current . relationship but are afraid to confront it. 'It . is escapism and avoidance and it's not healthy. We may have children . and mortgages now and that isn't going to change just because we see an . old flame again. 'Men are more . likely to fall into this bracket because they are less monogamous and . they have lower emotional intelligence than women. 'Social . networking sites have made contact with old school friends and old . flames so much easier and keeping this kind of thing secret no doubt . adds to the excitement. 'But it's a real mistake because it will all come out in the end.' Because of the very human tendency to look back on the past through rose-tinted spectacles, as many as one in five women and one quarter of all men would like to get back together with their first love .

Builders are reportedly making space for a nanny's quarters and a playroom for the singer's two daughters in his four-storey townhouse in Kensington.

One neighbour told the Evening Standard: 'We predicted this would cause a lot of trouble and we were right. We’ve been condemned to months of noise and inconvenience. 'This is supposed to be a family area but normal family life is being ruined by this fashion for basement excavations.' Another nearby resident said: 'Construction like this is a cause of long-standing gripes among neighbours. There are always works going on around here.' Complaints of noise, vibration and dust are commonly made in relation to basement projects, which can take more than a year to complete. Two residents' groups, the Kensington .

It would normally be on sale for around £500,000 but the estate agent handling the sale has admitted: 'There's just one snag.' Luxury property: The unfinished three-storey six-bedroom home is expected to sell for just £75,000 - but it could be hit by falling rocks at any time . Rock danger: Already three boulders have crashed into the back of the home in the last 12 months . The house, named Lakeside, could be hit by falling boulders from a former tinworks at any time - causing serious damage to the property. Already three two tonne boulders have crashed into the home in the past year causing some minor damage to the walls. The tinworks was closed in the 18th century and a modern housing development was built on it around 15 years ago. But the property, in the village of . Redbrook, Gloucestershire, is superbly placed on the banks of the River Wye close to the . Welsh border. It attracts fishermen from all over Europe for its wild . salmon. It boasts four reception rooms, two kitchens and two bathrooms but has not yet been fully fitted out. The Offa's Dyke Path and the Wye Valley Walk run through the village which has a post office and two pubs. Spice Girl Mel C lives in a neighbouring village and Harry Potter author J K Rowling was brought up nearby. Spectacular: The home is enviably located in the Wye Valley and could sell for £500,000 if there was no risk of falling rocks . Danger: A huge boulder which has come down the hillside property is seen no more than a few feet from the unfinished property which was built more than five years ago . Famous resident: Spice Girl Mel C lives nearby in a neighbouring village . Paul Fosh, managing director of his own auctioneer firm, said if a buyer is able to pin the rocks back they could potentially have a bargain property. However, at present the home cannot get building insurance - and no banks would be willing to provide a mortgage for it. It is due to go under the hammer at auction tonight, and the buyer may decide to knock the property down and start again. Mr Fosh said: 'Three boulders have hit the house in the last 12 months and have caused superficial damage. If someone was standing there at the time they could have been killed. 'It is being marketed as a potential building plot - it is a house that needs to be demolished. People have said they can get round the problem through engineering with pinning and netting. 'They have suggested putting big long girders into the rock face ever metre or so and then installing chicken mesh to secure the whole property. 'The house is built very close to the rock face which makes this difficult to do. 'People are looking at this and thinking they could spend £50,000 fixing the problem and then sell the property on for £400,000 or £500,000.' Two giant rocks which have rolled down the bank could be seen less than 10ft from the back of the house today. Rock risk: A buyer could install wire netting behind the property to stop the property being damaged. However, it was built so close to the cliff face such a task would be very difficult . When the land was sold to the builder, there was a covenant stipulating exactly what sort of house could be built to avoid the property being hit by boulders. However, the owners ignored the covenant and went ahead with their own flawed project. The interior of the three-storey property is unfinished because the developers stopped work when they discovered the problem more than five years ago. The advertisement says: 'It requires completion works both internally and externally but has double glazing and gas fired central heating.' A retired businessman who lives in the village said: 'It's a lovely modern house and it's going for a song. 'But would you sleep at night knowing a huge lump of rock could land in your bed at any time.'","Property in the Wye Valley, sitting on the banks of one of Britain's best salmon rivers, would otherwise sell for £500,000 .

A vicious family row over an £800,000 listed farmhouse was started when a retired academic invited his nephew's family to live with him after his prized lawnmower was stolen, a court has heard. Art historian, William 'Bill' Taylor, lived with his wife Audrey at Lower Manaton Farm, a grade II listed long house, in Callington, Cornwall, until he was widowed. But shaken by the theft of his Etesia lawnmower after his wife's death, he realised it was not good to be alone and invited his nephew, Roger Taylor, his partner, Denise Burkinshaw, and their children to move down from their Sheffield home to look after him, in 2001. Row: Roger Taylor, left, his partner, Denise Burkinshaw, right, and . their children to move down from their Sheffield home to look after William 'Bill' Taylor in 2001 and claim he said they could have the house . The couple set up home in the farmhouse’s east wing, while Mr Taylor stayed in the west. But as dispute began when his nephew and his family were adamant that Mr Taylor had promised to leave them his home in return for uprooting themselves from Sheffield. Appeal: Executors of Mr Taylor's estate, including his niece Gabrielle Bradbury . and her husband Peter (pictured) claim the judge made the wrong decision . But the pensioner, who died in his 90s in 2010, claimed that the only deal he ever struck with the couple was that they . could live in the house rent free if they contributed towards the . bills. To the day he died, he insisted he would be entirely within his . rights to throw them out. In August last year, Judge Jeremy Griggs accepted the couple’s plea and awarded them the whole of Lower Manaton Farm. However, three judges are now reviewing his judgement at the Court of Appeal after the executors of Mr Taylor's estate, including his niece Gabrielle Bradbury . and her husband Peter, claim he was . too generous to Roger Taylor and Miss Burkinshaw. Leslie Blohm QC, representing the executors . said there was no firm evidence that the pensioner had ever promised his . home to the couple and, even if he had, the award of the entire . property to them was 'an obviously disproportionate result'. The house made up the vast bulk of Mr . Taylor’s estate - valued in total at over £1million - and the judge’s ruling . meant that charities, to whom the pensioner had wanted to leave . £650,000, his great-granddaughter, Isobel Constantine, and his niece and . her husband all lost out. Under his final will, signed in 2009, Mr Taylor had left £650,000 - more than half his estate - to various charities. He . directed that the rest of his his estate be split into 100 equal parts, . with 55 of them going to his great granddaughter, Ms Constantine, 15 of . them to Mr and Mrs Bradbury and the remaining 30 to Roger Taylor and . his wife - but only on condition that they moved out of the house within . six months of his death. Mower: Mr Taylor was left shaken by the theft of his Etesia lawnmower (file picture of a simliar lawnmower) after his wife's death so asked his nephew and his family to move into the house . Dispute: Art historian, William 'Bill' Taylor, . lived with his wife Audrey at the £800,000 Lower Manaton Farm, (pictured) a grade II listed long . house, in Callington, Cornwall, until he was widowed . Mr Blohm said the relationship between Bill Taylor and his nephew was . 'not easy' even before the widower decided to share his home. Mr . Taylor had in the past 'bankrupted' his nephew over an unrepaid loan and . the evidence was that he regarded the younger man as 'a spendthrift, . ostentatious and a risky proposition'. Picture shows a self portrait with his wife by the late artist and academic William Taylor who died in 2010 . Mr . Blohm said trouble brewed in 2009 when the couple discovered Mr Taylor . had no intention of leaving them the house. They went to court, claiming . he had promised it to them, although he 'vehemently denied' ever having . done anything of the sort. Mr . Taylor even sought a court injunction against the couple, seeking exclusive . access for himself and his carers to guest rooms and the house’s laundry . room through his own front door. Had . Mr Taylor’s will held sway, there would have been no inheritance tax . liability on his estate. But Mr Blohm said Judge Griggs’ ruling saddled . the estate with a tax bill for almost £160,000. The . QC added that, when Mr Taylor was alive, he had been 'consistently . cautious' about giving any absolute assurances to the couple and he was . adamant that he had never promised them Lower . Manaton Farm. In August last year, Judge Griggs . accepted Denise Burkinshaw’s account that she had only reluctantly . agreed to abandon Sheffield for Cornwall and would never have done so . had Mr Taylor not assured her that she and her husband would inherit the . house. The couple had . helped the old man empty his bins, get his car in and out of his garage . and to put his laundry into the washing machine and, although that 'did . not amount to a great deal', the judge said it sealed the 'bargain' they . had reached with Mr Taylor.

In emails to a known terrorist, the man charged with killing 13 people in a 2009 attack at Fort Hood, Texas, expressed his support for suicide bombings and killing civilians — glaring signs that the FBI did not act on but should have, a report has claimed. Army Maj. Nidal Hasan told a radical Islamic cleric that he advocated using suicide bombers and that he believed it was OK to kill civilians. And the terrorist, Anwar al-Awlaki, a man well-known to the U.S. intelligence community, told Hasan in an email that the Army psychiatrist should keep his contact details handy. In contact: Army Maj. Nidal Hasan (left) exchanged emails with known terrorist Anwar al-Awlaki (right) But the agents on the FBI's Washington anti-terrorism task force thought the issue of a Muslim soldier talking to extremists was too sensitive to bring up with the Defense Department, Rep. Michael McCaul said after he was briefed on the findings of the independent review on Wednesday. 'It shows you the length of the political correctness stuff going on,' he told the Associated Press. FBI Director Robert Mueller called for the review in 2009 and asked a former bureau director, William Webster, to lead it. The FBI is expected to release an unclassified version of the report this week, McCaul said. Trial: U.S. Army Lt. Col. Kris Poppe is the lead defense attorney for Maj. Nidal Hasan . A Senate report released last year also . said the FBI missed warning signs about Hasan, who Senate investigators . said had become an Islamic extremist and a 'ticking time bomb' before . the rampage. But McCaul said some of the emails described in the Webster . report were ones he had not previously seen. Immediate reviews into the government's handling of the Hasan case revealed that members of two FBI anti-terrorism task forces saw emails between the Army psychiatrist and al-Awlaki beginning in December 2008. Those task forces reviewed the communications and decided they were in keeping with Hasan's research at the time, and as a result, no formal investigation of Hasan was opened. Hasan was writing a research paper about the effects of combat in Iraq and Afghanistan. But McCaul said that wasn't the whole story. The FBI in San Diego had been investigating al-Awlaki, a former San Diego resident, for his possible connections to the 9/11 hijackers. When agents saw emails between Hasan and al-Awlaki, they asked the FBI's Washington office to talk to Hasan's bosses, according to a government official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the Webster report. But the Washington agents thought that interviewing American Muslims who visit extremist websites was a sensitive issue and did not reach out to Hasan's bosses at the Defense Department. FBI agents also misinterpreted an abbreviation the Army used regarding Hasan, McCaul said. The Army identified Hasan as a 'Comms. Officer,' and, while the Army meant Hasan was a commissioned officer, the FBI interpreted it to mean that Hasan was a communications officer. The trial is taking place at the Lawrence H. Williams Judicial Center in Fort Worth, Texas . The FBI decided not to disseminate an intelligence report on Hasan because the FBI thought that as a communications officer, Hasan would have seen the report, the government official said. Neither the FBI nor Webster responded to requests for comment. But the FBI and Defense Department have said that they've made several policy changes since the Fort Hood assault to help prevent similar attacks. Hasan is charged with killing 13 people and wounding 32 others in the November 2009 attack at the Texas Army post. He is being tried in a military court. Al-Awlaki, implicated in other terror attacks, was killed in a drone strike in Yemen last year. In this courtroom sketch, U.S. Army Maj.

In fact, the average adult wastes 1.7million words over a lifetime while struggling to make a point, according to a study. Rather than get to the point, Britons skirt around issues and use long-winded phrases to hide what they really think leading to confusion and arguments according to an American survey. Argument starter: British sarcasm often gets laugh, but nearly 50 per cent of Britons admit it's been misinterpreted and in some cases, caused an argument . With thousands of foreigners coming . to the London for the Games, many tourists might be left baffled by our . evasiveness and superfluous words with double meanings. Foreigners aren't the only ones who have trouble understanding, with a third of us struggling to decipher what people really mean and 46 per cent wishing we . could be more direct talking like New Yorkers who are known for their straight . talking. British sarcasm has got nearly half of . Britons into am awkward situation after it has been misinterpreted, with . two in five revealing it led to an argument or dispute. According to the survey, three . quarters of us admit to regularly using the word ‘maybe’ when we mean . ‘no’, while three fifths often say ‘I’m fine’ when we are really . thinking ‘I’m not, stop asking’. Other offending phrases include saying . ‘it’s OK’ when we are really thinking ‘I am really disappointed’ and . telling workmates ‘could we consider some other options?’ when what we . really mean is ‘I don’t like your idea’. The ultimate snub, which a third . admit saying, is ‘I understand what you are saying’ when actually what . we really want to say is ‘I disagree and do not want to discuss it . further’. Saying ‘that’s not bad’ actually mean . ‘that’s good’ while in true British style 29 per cent shy away from . confrontation by using the phrase ‘I kind of agree’ when really they do . not agree at all. Britons are worse in the workplace with two-fifths avoiding straight talking by not being direct enough with colleagues. According to the New York Bakery .

New information has been uncovered about the criminal pasts of Misty and Daniel Morrissey, whose 10-year-old daughter Lyric Cook went missing along with her eight-year-old cousin Elizabeth Collins almost a week ago. Court records from Black Hawk County, Iowa show that both parents have multiple drug convictions and Misty was sentenced to four years in federal prison for helping to run a methamphetamine drug ring. Indeed, the couple have said that they have been questioned repeatedly by police investigating the disappearance of their daughter saying, 'You tell them the truth and they say, 'You're holding something back,' and you're not.' Scroll Down for Video . Mom and dad: Lyric's parents Misty and Dan . Morrissey have chequered criminal pasts and are becoming frustrated that speculation is centred on that and not the two girls disappearance . The Evansdale couple have commented that the extensive nature of the police inquiry has made them feel like they were under investigation in the case of missing Lyric and Elizabeth.

The pair's criminal records are chequered and Misty was only released from prison on May 30 after serving time for nine different crimes, including illegal drug use, association with persons involved in criminal activity, excessive alcohol use and failure to comply with drug testing. In addition, eight years prior to that in 2003, Misty was sentenced to four years in jail after pleading guilty to conspiracy to manufacture and distribute methamphetamine. Missing: Eight-year-old Elizabeth Collins, left, . and 10-year-old Lyric Cook disappeared while riding their bikes not far . from Elizabeth's home in Evansdale, Iowa . The sentence was later commuted to five months in prison and a full year of supervised release. Other criminal convictions belonging to Misty include a 1998 ticket for having an open container of alcohol in a vehicle and in 1997 she entered a guilty plea for making a false report to police, a crime which cost her six days in prison. Morrissey is facing a September trial in Black Hawk County after his arrests for drug possession that date from last year. A look back into court records reveals the depths into which Misty had fallen as she became involved in the meth trade. Working for a David Mickelson, her former boss at the BIG Ten Mart in Waterloo, Iowa, Misty was a key member of the drugs ring eight years ago. 'Cook testified that she obtained pseudoephedrine pills from various people and provided them to Scott Reavis, who used them to make methamphetamine,' court records stated to the Des Moines Register . In fact, Morrissey stormed out of a long interview with law enforcement officials after they point blank accused him of killing Lyric Cook and Elizabeth Collins, the girl's grandmother said. 'Yeah, there's history in our family, but it's not a history that we're scared of,' said 36-year-old Misty. Close: The girls, pictured in 2009, would often spend the day together when Lyric's mother was at work and were very close . 'It's one we've dealt with. It's one we've come past and we've come past it as a family so no matter what anybody thinks about it, it's not one that has anything to do with you know, the disappearance of our children.' Rallying against the speculation that she and Morrissey may have been responsible for the deaths of Lyric and Elizabeth, Misty was adamant that their focus should be elsewhere. 'We want everybody in the main part of the criminal investigation who has the authority or the power to do things and make decisions, we want them focused on our girls and what might have happened to them,' said Misty. 'You know but if looking into our history is what's needed then that's fine, too.' The revelations of the couples criminal past comes as the spotlight falls on the investigation into the disappearance of their daughter and Elizabeth Collins. In an interview with ABC News on Wednesday morning, Misty explained how extensively they have been questioned by the police. Dan Morrissey leans on a tree . near Meyers Lake where his daughter Lyric and her cousin Elizabeth . Collins disappeared last week . 'We've done extensive interviews, hours at a time,' said Misty. 'We've done polygraphs. We have taken many phone calls, answered many questions. 'We've given our phones up. 'All of our data has been, you know, taken off our phones. 'In fact, my sister and my phone is now not - our touch screens aren't working very well. 'So we've cooperated to the fullest, you know.' An FBI expert and former special agent believes that law enforcement is looking at every angle they can in the case.

Desperate search: Authorities look for possible . evidence at Meyers Lake where Lyric Cook-Morrissey, 10, and Elizabeth . Collins, 8, disappeared last Friday . It has also been revealed that in the week's before both girl's going missing, Misty and Daniel were having issues at home and were preparing to file for divorce. 'They are not a couple,' said Misty's sister Tammy Brousseau to ABC News. 'They are currently separated and maybe well on the way to a divorce.' Daniel Morrissey also told reporters of his battle to keep a cool head during this stressful time. 'I'll tell you something about emotions,' said Morrissey. 'A lot of people base their decisions off emotions and it doesn't work out too well. 'They're angry, they make a bad decision, whatever. 'So emotions I try to keep control of and keep my head straight. 'During this time, it's definitely challenging, but I have to keep my mind right.' Despite the interest from the authorities, Misty and Morrissey have cooperated fully with their investigation. 'They are still continuing to cooperate with us as we would expect,' said Black Hawk County Sheriff's Office spokesman Ricj Abben. When asked about Morrissey and Misty feeling like suspects in their own daughters disappearance, Abben said he was unsure why. Search: This poster was issued to complement rescue efforts by around 400 officials and volunteers . 'I don't know why he feels that way,' said Abben. 'We expect cooperation from everyone - 100 percent cooperation. 'So I don't know why he feels that way.' Heather and Drew Collins, Elizabeth’s parents, have minor offenses in their backgrounds, an online check of court records shows. Elizabeth and Lyric were last seen on Friday, riding their bicycles in downtown Evansdale, Iowa. When they never returned home, hundreds of volunteers spent the weekend looking for the girls, and their bikes were found next to Meyers Lake. More than 350 volunteers joined the search over the weekend.

'This is all in a day's work for community pharmacies which check the appropriateness of 900million prescription items a year.' Pharmacists want access to patients’ summary care records. Doctors, however, do not want this to happen as they fear it could breach patient confidentiality. Last month it emerged that almost 50million prescriptions were handed out by doctors in 2011 - a rise of 9 per cent compared with the previous 12 months. Experts said increasing numbers of patients are turning to GPs for help as depression loses its stigma. At the same time, doctors are more inclined to give people a proper diagnosis and prescribe medication, rather than simply sending them away.","In just one week, pharmacists had to double-check 4,409 pharmacies across England .

Two brothers have developed an age-reversing disease, which has abruptly halted their adulthood and instead leaves them behaving like young children. Matthew, 39, and Michael Clark, 42, both had jobs and were able to have normal relationships until their mannerisms became more and more childlike - just like in the film the Curious Case of Benjamin Button. They have now been forced to move back home with their parents in Lincoln and ex-RAF regiment Michael is now estimated to have a mental age of 10 and is said to giggle constantly. Rare disease: Matthew, right, 39, and Michael Clark, 42, now spend their days living at home with their parents and playing with toys as their mental age continues to regress . While factory worker Matthew, whose 19-year-old daughter Lydia is expecting a baby, behaves much like a toddler. After their behaviour started to change, the brothers were eventually diagnosed with terminal leukodystrophy last year. The condition usually only affects newborns, and is so rare there are only 100 people affected in the whole of the UK. Tragic: Anthony and Christine Clark, with their sons Matthew (left), and Michael, at their home in Lincoln. The brothers were only diagnosed with terminal leukodystophy last year . Leukodystrophy is a neurological disease which affects the brain, nervous system and the spinal cord. Their form of the disease mirrors the plot of the film The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, based on the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel, in which an old man constantly gets younger, rather than growing old - although the brothers physical appearance is not changing. The brothers' devastated parents Anthony, 63, and Christine Clark, 61, told how they had to abandon their dream retirement in Benidorm to come back to Lincoln and look after their sons. Anthony said an average day for the family now consisted of entertaining is adult boys with board games, cartoons and comics. He said: 'Both the boys like cartoons, especially the Smurfs and Alice in Wonderland, and the types of films they like to watch has changed to those aimed at children. 'Matthew loved the first Back to the Future, but he didn't like the second and third one and like a kid if he doesn't like it he just gets up and leaves or turns it off. Regression: Matthew Clark, left,  aged around . 12 and Michael Clark on his 16th birthday - . their behaviour now mirrors their childhood years . Leukodystrophy is a neurological disease which affects the brain, nervous system and the spinal cord. The condition usually only affects newborns, and is so rare there are only 100 people affected in the whole of the UK. Leukodystrophies are mostly inherited disorders, meaning that it is passed on from parent to child. The Myelin Project funds research . into the disease. CEO of Myelin's British arm, Lynda Carthy, said: 'There is an estimated . one in three billion chance of two people who carry the gene deficiency . meeting and becoming partners. 'The chances of the children developing the condition are dependant on . what type of leukodystrophy the parents have. If both have the recessive . gene then there is a one in four chance of the children having the . disease. 'If only the mother has the gene every boy born would have a form of . leukodystrophy. Of course it's important to say there are 37 known types . of the disease at the moment but doctors are diagnosing new forms which . simply have not been catalogued yet and named.' The word leukodystrophy comes from the Greek words leuko (meaning white), trophy (meaning growth), and dys (meaning ill). The words put together, form leukodystrophy - a set of diseases that affect the growth or maintenance of the white matter (myelin). All leukodystrophies are a result of problems with the growth or maintenance of the myelin sheath - so far about forty different types of leukodystrophy have been identified. 'At the moment they really like . snakes and ladders and Monopoly but other games like Cluedo we've bought . them are proving too difficult. 'In terms of diet they both love crisps but we have tried to improve their eating habits.' After moving to Spain in 2007 Michael and Matthew's parents began to notice unusual things about their sons. Anthony usually spoke to Matthew and Michael once a week and sent a text most days to the pair. Matthew was still in full-time . employment but had split from his wife whereas Michael was not working . since being medically discharged from the RAF after falling and damaging . his knee. Michael went on to qualify as a cabinet maker but today his talents are lost. Anthony said: 'It was little things . at first, not replying to a text, or not answering their phones. But . then we wouldn't hear from them for weeks. 'When I did finally get hold of Michael he told me he hadn't had any credit which was odd because that wasn't like him.' Anthony said things came to a head when he received a phone call from his granddaughter Lydia last year. He said: 'She told me she had a call . from someone at the YMCA about Michael asking for her dad Matthew's . details. It was then that we found out Matthew had lost his job. 'He was so confused about what to do . he had been sitting in a room with just a candle at night and no food or . electricity for two weeks because he didn't know how to claim benefits. He was as helpless as a child.' Anthony, who worked in the prison service for 22 years, said: 'It is a devastating disease. 'Both of them are very childlike now. Matthew went out the other day and bought himself a train set and a Mr Potato Head. Before the disease: Ex-RAF regiment Michael, left, is now estimated to have a mental age of 10 and is said to giggle constantly, while Matthew, right was fired from his job as a factory worker after his behaviour changed . 'He also has these awful episodes where he screams and shouts and says 'I don't know what I'm doing'. 'It is like an adult having a toddler's tantrum. It's obviously worse for him but it is terrible for us too. 'There's nothing we can do to help and we feel absolutely powerless.' Mr and Mrs Clark came back to the UK in January to look after their sons who now need full time care. Mr Clark told how the brothers' lives began to unravel after their symptoms started to become more pronounced. Unusual: The disease mirrors the plot of the film The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, based on the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel, in which an old man played by Brad Pitt, pictured, constantly gets younger, rather than growing old . He added: 'Michael was evicted from . his flat because he stopped looking after himself. If he dropped . something it would stay there and he stopped doing the dishes. 'Matthew . was fired from his job as a factory worker, and although we don't know . the full story we can only assume it is because he was behaving like a . child.' Michael moved . into Matthew's flat after the eviction but left shortly after a row with . a neighbour, believing he was being told to leave. After sleeping in a park for three weeks he found a soup kitchen who sent him to the Salvation Army. Mr Clark said: 'They knew something was wrong at once and they sent him to a doctor. 'The doctors carried out an MRI scan . and they discovered the condition. When they asked him if he had any . siblings he said he had a brother and they ran tests on Matthew and . discovered he had the same thing.

Prefers everyday life: While she loved winning Olympic silver, Zara Phillips prefers the simple pleasures including a trip to Waitrose to the glamour of life in the Royal Family . She may be the Queen’s grand-daughter and one of our Olympic medallists to boot, but Zara Phillips craves a low-key domesticity which couldn’t be further from life in the Royal Family. Instead of pomp and glamour, it is the simple pleasures of buying new shoes, a trip to Waitrose or a rainy afternoon spent watching a DVD that she dreams of, she revealed today. But for the time being at least, what to many of us is a day-to-day reality remains a distant dream for the 31-year-old. Fresh from winning silver as part of . our eventing team, she remains so busy with her equestrian career that . even a year after her wedding to rugby player Mike Tindall, they still . have not had time to book a honeymoon. She . told how she was ‘still living the Olympic dream’ and revelling in . being part of the record-breaking GB squad, but also looking forward to a . return to normality. Competing . often means getting back to the yard in the middle of the night, faced . with an hour’s work unloading the horses and their kit with another . early start to look forward to in the morning. ‘People . assume I always look like I do in my riding kit or in a dress at a . social event, but the day-to-day me is driving around in my filthy car . with my dogs in the boot, wearing a pair of jeans and a hoody,’ she . said. ‘On the rare occasion that we do get a . weekend off, we enjoy spending it together at our home in Cheltenham, . with the dogs of course. ‘I’ll . make a quick detour past Waitrose on the way back from the yard and . Mike and I will cook something easy for supper - probably Italian.’ Once . the eventing season comes to an end in October, a typical Saturday . night would be an evening in the local pub with friends - something of a . contrast to her cousin Prince Harry’s style of letting his hair down. Then a Sunday will see her go swimming followed by a chance to catch up on ‘all the chores I haven’t done’. ‘I enjoy having Sunday lunch with the family and, when it’s cold and wet outside, watching a film afterwards,’ she added. Busy in equestrian career: Phillips said she was still 'living the Olympic dream' after she was presented her medal by her mother Princess Anne, but was looking forward to returning to normality . In the interview, Phillips described her favourite item of clothing as ‘my jeans’ and her greatest weakness as ‘shoes’. Her favourite things are her husband, her dogs, her family and friends, her car and her Galaxy tablet computer, she said, while asked what she would have been in another life she replied ‘a sport physio’. On Sunday, Phillips and the rest of the GB eventing quintet will be reunited as they show off their medals at the Land Rover Burghley Horse Trials. Favourites: Her husband, rugby player Mike Tindall, her dogs and her family and friends are some of her favourite things . No time for honeymoon: Even after a year of marriage Phillips and Tindall have still not had time to book a honeymoon . While thrilled with their silver, she . admitted to still being disappointed not to have managed the clear . round in the showjumping that might have seen them win gold. ‘I couldn’t believe how much support we got from the home crowd,’ she said. ‘It . was unreal and wonderful - and the crowds were even louder on . cross-country day’ - which happened to be her first wedding anniversary. More horse riding: On Sunday Phillips will join the GB team again at the Land Rover Burghley Horse Trials . Favourite clothing: While most people assume she likes getting dressed up, right, or wearing her riding kit, left, for day-to-day life she picks jeans, her 'favourite item of clothing', and a hooded jumper . The following day, Phillips and her . horse, High Kingdom, picked up seven penalties in the show jumping, the . final phase, and the team lost out on gold to Germany. ‘Yes, I was disappointed in myself for what happened,’ she said. ‘I . would have loved to have gone clear but that is the nature of sport - . if it was easy then the achievements wouldn’t mean so much. ‘I . was delighted with our silver medal. You can always look back at what . might have been, but the team still came away with a good result at our . home Games.’ Disappointed with showjumping: While thrilled with silver, Phillips admitted being disappointed not to have managed the clear round in showjumping that might have seen the team win gold . Phillips and the rest of the eventing team stayed at the Olympic Village, and were as caught up in the spirit of the Games as the rest of the country. ‘I felt so honoured to be part of the whole thing, to be there with all those athletes, looking back on so many incredible triumphs,’ she said. With the eventing season still in full flow, Phillips has had little time to look back on her success. And she revealed she and Tindall still have no idea when they will fit in a honeymoon more than a year after their wedding, not least with the new rugby season about to start. ‘We’d love to go somewhere hot or skiing but who knows when we’ll get the chance?’ she said.","The Queen's grand-daughter Zara Phillips prefers a low-key, every day life .

Women over 40 will be entitled to free fertility treatment on the NHS for the first time under Government guidelines to be published this week. The NHS is set to extend the controversial upper age limit for IVF by three years to 42,  following advice that suggests many women in their late 30s and early 40s could conceive after treatment. The current guidance is that the NHS should not provide IVF to women over the age of 39. Government guidelines: Women over 40 will be entitled to free fertility treatment on the NHS for the first time . Now 8,000 more women a year could have the chance to become mothers without having to pay £5,000 to private clinics. Fertility experts said the recommendations may encourage more women to delay having babies until middle age, which puts both mother and child at risk. Children born to women over 40 are more likely to have abnormalities, and mothers are more likely to have problems during labour. Nearly half of all pregnancies in women aged 40 to 42 result in miscarriage. However, the review has come because of concerns in the NHS that the existing age limit could leave clinics open to legal challenges under new age-discrimination laws. The update, by Government rationing watchdog the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), is also expected to make it easier for couples hoping to start a family to access fertility treatment. At the moment, couples must have been trying unsuccessfully for a baby for three years before being considered for NHS treatment. But the recommendations, due to be published on Tuesday, will allow couples access to free IVF after only two years. A senior source said: ‘The upper age limit for IVF on the NHS is to be increased to 42 and will grant those women one single cycle of IVF. ‘There will also be earlier access to treatment. Instead of waiting for three years, couples will now get through to IVF clinics after unsuccessfully trying for a baby for two years.’ Dr Gedis Grudzinskas, former emeritus professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at Barts and the Royal London NHS Trust, said the recommendations sent out ‘the wrong message’ and added: ‘Part of this is about taking equality to the extreme to protect those who feel sensitive about accusations of ageism, and that’s a nonsense. ‘Society shouldn’t use this as an excuse to continue to delay looking for Mr Right, and economically speaking the NHS can’t afford it.’ IVF expert Gillian Lockwood, medical director of Midland Fertility Services, said: ‘In biological terms, 35 is actually too late to start trying for a family. ‘What’s important is for society to recognise that couples should start families in their late 20s or early 30s.’ More than 46,000 women had IVF in 2010 and about 40 per cent were NHS patients. Nearly 8,000 were aged between 40 and 42 and would have been treated in the private sector, where clinics set age limits higher than the NHS. NICE decided to review the guidance to make sure it fully complied with the Equality Act, passed in 2010. The recommendations are in draft form and will go through a period of consultation until July. The final guidance will not be mandatory and individual NHS trusts can decide not to implement it. A NICE spokesman said: ‘We cannot comment on speculation on the draft update. Any new recommendations will have been developed according to new evidence published since 2004.’","NHS set to extend controversial upper age limit for IVF by three years to 42 .

Oliver had no idea what was happening when he began shaking and vomiting at sixth form college just over a year ago . A teenager who thought he felt sick due to a hangover was actually suffering a stroke that almost killed him. Last year Oliver Lilburn started shaking uncontrollably in front of his friends at his sixth form college in Ipswich before he was violently sick and blacked out. He was rushed to hospital where doctors told his parents Justine and Colin he had suffered a brain haemorrhage leading to the stroke and they should prepare to say their final farewells. But Oliver, now 19, clung to life and now after a tough year of rehab he wants to raise awareness about the illness. Oliver, of Dedham, north Essex, said: 'To be honest, I still haven't really comes to terms with the whole thing. 'I thought I was just hungover. But my vision was blurry and then later in the day my whole right side started shaking. Then I vomited on the way to hospital and passed out.' The teenager had just returned from a six-week charity project in Africa when he was hit by the bolt out of the blue. 'The doctors told mum and dad to fear the worst and say their last goodbyes to me,' he said. 'It was touch and go for a while.' The following day Oliver was transferred from Ipswich Hospital to the intensive care unit at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge. His close friend Florence Irvine, 19, of Felixstowe, Suffolk, said: 'We went up the morning after it happened - it was horrible. 'He's usually so energetic and fun and he just looked so fragile. 'Oliver could tell we were there and would grab our hands but that was all we were getting from him.' Scroll down for video . Oliver pictured with his parents Justine and Colin a month after his stroke. His parents had originally been told to say their final goodbyes . Oliver, 19, now plans to go to university after spending a year undergoing rehab following a stroke . The devastating stroke left Oliver without any movement on his right side and badly affected his speech. Following weeks of intensive treatment in hospital, he is well on the way to making a full recovery, apart from having slightly slurred speech. 'Part of my rehab is going to the gym . and I'm lucky to always go with my dad, brother, cousin, or a close . friend during the week,' he said. He wants to raise money for the charity Different Strokes for young stroke survivors who don't have the same amount of support as he did. Stroke is the single largest cause of disability in the UK. Around 150,000 people suffer a stroke every year and a quarter of these are under the age of 65. Oliver is now preparing to go to university after he had to postpone going away last year.

Heartbroken men take four weeks to change their Facebook status following a break-up - while women do so almost straight away, a study has revealed. The majority of men - 63 per cent 'prolong the misery' of updating their profile from 'In a Relationship' to 'Single' for a month or more, eight per cent fail to do so at all. If and when they do, only a third admits if they were dumped - and even fewer - 15 per cent - reveal the reasons why. The majority of men delay updating their profile from 'In a Relationship' to 'Single' for a month longer than women . Women, on the other hand, tend to go public within a few days, often with a new description and photograph to reflect their 'happy single' status. The study by new dating site ALovingSpace.com was based on a survey of 1,000 unmarried 18-65 year-old male and female members across the UK. It found that male respondents generally coped with splits far worse than women, and were more likely to bottle-up their emotions and 'present a tougher front' to friends. Painful: Men are believed to suffer from break ups more because they suppress their emotions . Almost 20 per cent of female respondents, on the other hand, admitted they had or would change their social media profiles immediately - often in order to hurt or humiliate their ex-partners. A spokesman for ALovingSpace.com said he was 'not surprised' by the results, which appear to overturn the widespread assumption that women are more vulnerable after a break-up. 'On the face of it, men are the tough talkers and the ones who present a tougher front but that is just societal conditioning. 'Behind the facade they hurt just like women, but because they suppress their emotions it ends up hurting even more,' he said. 'Our . research appears to suggest that men are hit the hardest by . relationship break-ups and, as a result, prolong the misery of telling . the world about it on social media platforms such as Facebook.

A High Court catfight has erupted between the bosses of a top London modelling agency and a former catwalk king whom they accuse of poaching models, 'fraud' and breach of contract. Brazilian rising star Talita Correa is among the models allegedly diverted away from the agency to a rival business set up by Jon Bruce. Premier Model Management - whose staff and models are the subject of the C4 series ‘The Model Agency’- has accused Mr Bruce of poaching models while still under their employment. A top judge has heard that the former . male model was so good at his job that, at times, he generated a third . of Premier's income. Mr Bruce was dismissed from his position on July 24 and he was served with court papers on the same day. The case has now reached London’s . High Court, with Rupert Butler, for the agency, telling Judge Michael . Kent QC that Mr Bruce is accused of 'diverting away' models from Premier . to a rival modelling business - whilst still in the agency’s employ. Mr Butler also accused Mr Bruce of . 'perpetrating a very serious fraud' whilst working for Premier and of . breaching his contract of employment. Mr . Bruce is claimed to have tried to gain an unfair competitive advantage . for new model management venture, Paulo Ribero Management Ltd (PRM), . which he is alleged to have started up in January this year with . business partner, Paulo Ribero. The . allegations of diverting models relate to three individuals who are on . the books of PRM, Mr Butler told the court, including Brazilian rising . star, Talita Correa, and Matthew Holbrook, a Rochdale model, who was the . runner up of C4’s Model Behaviour show. Paulo Ribero and PRM are also defendants in the action. Talita Correa, left, and Matthew Holbrook, . right, are two of the models Bruce is accused of 'diverting' from his . former employers . Nasty: The claws are out between Premier Model Management Ltd - whose staff and models were the subject of C4 series 'The Model Agency' - and one of the stars of show, Jon Bruce, back left . Mr Butler told the judge: 'What we . have here is a case of real damage that has been perpetrated on the . claimant and we want to get on with this case and find out exactly what . the damage is, so we can get on with rectifying the situation with our . customers, our clients and models. 'There . is a prima facie case that a very serious fraud has been perpetrated,' he added, asking for the judge to make an interim order that Mr Bruce . disclose to his former employers 'all confidential information or . property in his possession, but belonging to the claimant.' The barrister said Premier - whose boss . Carole White and chief booker Aidan Jean-Marie attended the hearing - . were seeking that order because, 'Mr Bruce still isn’t coming to heel . and doing that which he needs to do to remedy the situation he had . created.' 'Mr Bruce has acted for eight or nine . months completely behind our backs and deceitfully. We don’t know what . he’s done. We want him to tell us what he’s been up to,' the barrister . said. Emily Betts, for Mr Bruce, Mr Ribero . and PRM, asked for the application for the 'onerous order' to be . rejected, saying that it would unfairly restrict Mr Bruce’s ability to . earn a living when no wrongdoing has been proved against him. She . described Mr Bruce as 'good at his job, well known in the industry and . he has a lot of contacts,' saying the claim was 'an attempt to stifle . him and prevent him earning money doing his job and using his skills . elsewhere.' 'The . claimant has not shown what this unfair competitive advantage that the . defendant has gained is. We contend that his summary dismissal was . wrongful. They should not have dismissed him but they did,' she added. Denying there had been any wrongdoing, let alone fraud, by Mr Bruce, Miss Betts went on: 'The claimants contacted him to say they were concerned about his loyalty to the business. 'They put the case that he was working for PRM during his employment... He said he was willing to talk to them about that but didn’t hear anything back until he received a claim form.' Judge Kent, delivering his ruling, . allowed Premier Models’ application for disclosure, giving Mr Bruce . seven days in which to produce the material requested. Legal arguments: The case at the High Court, pictured, has heard that Mr Bruce has been accused of 'perpetrating a very serious fraud' whilst working for Premier and of breaching his contract of employment . The . judge said: 'This is case where it is alleged that Mr Bruce, who was an . employee of the claimant since 2007, has been in breach of the terms of . his employment contract by taking steps to set up a rival business with . his business partner Mr Ribero from January this year. 'It . is said that he has been passing on copyrighted information and other . material with a view to gaining an advantage for the rival business. 'There is a clear prima facie case of a . flagrant breach of those obligations which Mr Bruce owed and would have . realised on the face of it were his obligations, and would justify in my . judgement various forms of relief. 'This is a case where serious allegations are made that £850 was charged to clients of Premier Models which related to a model of PRM’s. I don’t see how that can be anything but an attempt to defraud Premier Models,' he went on. 'In all the circumstances, it seems to me that, while the orders may be onerous, there is a strong arguable case for interim relief. The claimants are entitled to protect their business,' he said. Allowing Premier’s disclosure application, the judge gave Mr Bruce seven days in which to 'disgorge everything.'","Premier Model .

The girls’ grieving parents have kept a round-the-clock vigil at Megan’s bedside while she lay in intensive care. Heartbroken: Megan (left) was told the devastating news that her older sister Sadie (right) had died in the car crash . The youngster came around three days later and started asking for her sister when her parents had to break it to her that Sadie had died in the crash. Their grandfather John McGrady, 62, said: 'It is heartbreaking - the two girls were inseparable. 'They were always together in the house or if they went out together. Always together, always playing.' The sisters were in the back of the family car when it was in a head-on crash near the family home in Mostyn, North Wales last Sunday. Their parents Kate Barlow, 34, who was driving, and John Paul McGrady, 39, escaped without serious injury. But 'little angel' Sadie died at the scene and 'critically injured' Megan was airlifted to Alder Hey Children’s Hospital in Liverpool. Grandfather Mr McGrady said: 'She wasn’t conscious when she got to hospital - she was in intensive care but they’ve moved her out of there now. Best of friends: Megan (right) was rushed to hospital and only learned that Sadie (left) had died after waking up from a coma . 'I have spoken to John Paul and said Megan woke last night and cried, asking for her sister. 'She is sitting up in bed now - I think they have explained to her.' Mrs McGrady and her husband, a wind turbine technician, have been at Alder Hey with their surviving daughter since the crash. Mr McGrady said: 'Sadie’s gone but Megan is still there, she will be in hospital for a few more days but she will pull through. 'Sadie was a beautiful girl. She was never in moods or anything like that - always happy. 'Sadie enjoyed school, she enjoyed herself. 'It’s hit everybody, it’s such a shock. I haven’t been out. 'I used to go out every day, but I just can’t face people in the street, it’s just too hard' Seven people, including two of Sadie’s cousins, were injured in the two car crash on the A548 in the village of Gwespyr, North Wales. Playmates: Sadie (left) and her sister Megan (right) were inseparable. Their grieving parents escaped the crash without serious injury . Flowers were yesterday left outside Bryn Pennant school where Sadie was a pupil. Assistant head teacher Julie Davies said: 'Sadie was a bright and confident child with her whole life ahead of her. 'She was popular and well-loved by pupils and staff. She would greet visitors with a beautiful smile and a friendly comment and loved lengthy chats with her teachers. 'She was kind, sensitive, thoughtful and wise beyond her years, a real character who was adored by everyone. 'For her to be so cruelly snatched at such a young age is absolutely devastating. 'We cannot begin to imagine the distress that her poor parents and family are experiencing. 'Our hearts ache for them in their suffering. This has had a tremendous effect on the whole community.' Mostyn councillor Patrick Heesom said: 'The whole community is distraught. Sadie was a little angel and this is completely devastating. 'Sadie was a darling - she could often be seen playing with her sister and friends. 'This is heartbreaking and my thoughts and prayers are with her parents and the rest of the family.' Police are still investigating the accident between a Vauxhall Corsa and a Ford Focus. An inquest into Sadie's death has been opened and adjourned .","Megan McGrady was unconscious for three days after the crash which claimed the life of her older sister .

A jilted wife caused thousands of pounds of damage after driving into her love rival's home in a jealous rage. Tracey Ann Orton, 42, who ran a fish and chip shop with her husband Kevin, was furious when she discovered he had moved in with another woman. Although the pair had separated, she had believed they were going to get back together. In a fit of rage Orton drove and crashed her car into a garage next to the home of her husband’s new partner, Sarah Carroll. The crash was so loud pedestrians from nearby Holderness Road ran to see what the commotion was. Hull Crown Court heard witness Helen Ralph ran to the scene to discover Orton’s car was embedded in an outbuilding. Orton, from Kingswood, Hull had to be pulled from the wreckage but was uninjured. The damage to the building was estimated to cost £12,290 and damage to bikes inside the building came to £200. In the weeks leading up to the crash, Orton, 42, had sent abusive text messages and had confrontations with her former partner. She has pleaded guilty to destroying property. Prosecutor Phillip Evans told the court: 'The defendant was married to, and was separated from, a man called Kevin Orton. 'She had not come to terms with it and shortly after he started a relationship with Sarah Carroll. 'This led in the past to abusive text messages and personal confrontations. 'Orton drove her vehicle into the outbuilding and it had to be demolished. Wait: At Hull Crown Court, pictured, Judge Mettyear has given Orton six months to prove she can stay out of trouble before he passes sentence . 'The building belonged to the owners of the adjacent property. The Mews is where Sarah Carroll lives and her property is adjacent to this building. 'We say Orton was making an unwelcome gesture towards Carroll.' Orton’s barrister, Claire Holmes, claimed the crash on March 8 was an accident but this was dismissed by the judge. She said: 'There was a dispute between them about what had happened previously. 'The reason she was driving in this way was is because she had just learnt Mr Orton was living there with his new partner. That came as a surprise to her as she was under the impression, just a few days before, that a reconciliation was perhaps possible, even likely. 'In that emotional state she drove to where he was to have some form of verbal confrontation. 'In that emotional state she lost control of her car. 'She doesn’t accept it was a deliberate accident out of malice to send a message to anyone.' The Honorary Recorder of Hull and the East Riding, Judge Mettyear, said: 'Her explanation seems unlikely in the extreme.' Miss Holmes told the court Orton had now moved on with her life. She said: 'The damage has been met by her vehicle’s insurance company. The rebuilding cost has been met by the insurance company also. 'She has made a good deal of progress with her life. She has accepted it and has moved on with her own life and has made progress through counselling.' Judge Mettyear has given Orton six months to prove she can stay out of trouble before he passes sentence. He warned her if she was unable to put the relationship behind her she could face jail. Judge Mettyear said: 'This is a woman of good character. 'She pleaded guilty and was going through an emotional time. 'If she has really put this breakdown behind her then she will not be going to prison.' He told Orton: 'You committed a serious offence. I don’t like to send people like you to prison but I want to make sure there is no more misbehaviour. 'I’m not going to sentence you yet, but in six months, and put you on trust. If you stay out of trouble I promise I will not send you away. 'If you get into any more trouble, you might well be at risk. It is up to you. 'Let us see how you behave.'","Tracey Ann Orton, 42, was furious when she discovered her husband, Kevin, had moved in with another woman .

Mum would go mad. ‘My dad didn’t talk too much about the war and when he did it was usually light-hearted. ‘This one is the only Hitler figure I have left. I had another of him standing in a car doing the Nazi salute but dad shot it.’ Pvt Beaulier served in the 9th Armoured Division of the US Army from 1943 until the end of the war.

The Olympic dreams of British judoka Gemma Howell ended in tears and heartbreak today as she was controversially disqualified from her first round bout. There were boos from the partisan home crowd at the ExCeL Centre when Howell, 22, picked up a passivity penalty with two minutes remaining of her clash with reigning world and European champion Gevrise Emane of France. But things got worse when, with only 30 seconds to go, the fighters fell to the ground and video referees ruled that Howell had illegally grabbed her opponent's leg - meaning an automatic disqualification. Head in hands: Gemma Howell reacts with despair after her disqualification . Marching orders: An official breaks the bad news to Howell after video referees reviewed a tussle on the ground. They adjudged that Howell had grabbed the leg of her French opponent Gevrise Emane . Direct attacks to the legs have been outlawed under new rule changes introduced since the last Olympics. Howell, one of Sportsmail's Magnificent Seven whose progress this paper has tracked since 2005, had taken the fight to her opponent during the early stages at the start of her under-63kg category bout, roared on by the home crowd. But the judoka from Wolverhampton could have no complaints about the ruling. She said: 'I think it was the right decision. I was down a penalty towards the end of the fight and knew she was ahead on attacks, so I had nothing to lose. 'I felt it was a situation which a few years ago would have been fine, but it is not allowed any more. I went for it and I shouldn't have.' Howell and Emane grapple on the floor with 30 seconds remaining in their first round bout at the ExCeL Centre . Howell clearly has a hold of her opponent's foot as they try to score the winning points . Too late, Howell realises that she's committed a foul and is likely to be disqualified . Howell, who trains at the British Judo Performance Institute in Dartford, Kent, battled through injury in order to reach the Games and her bout with Emane represented a big step up in class. Nine months ago, she suffered anterior cruciate ligament knee injury which put her Olympics participation in severe doubt. She only resumed full training in March after surgery and months of rehabilitation, making the British team in June. She added: 'Maybe when I go home and look at it again I can be positive, but right now I am completely gutted. 'I didn't come here to fight hard, I came here to win it, so I didn't do what I wanted to. 'It's what makes being an Olympic champion in judo so special - that you do only get that one chance every four years. 'Rio will be the next big thing for me now, but I will just have to wait for that.' An official has the task of delivering the bad news to the home favourite after a referral to a video official . Despite facing the second seed, Howell had taken the fight to her opponent in the early stages, encouraged by a large and partisan crowd . Elsewhere, Euan Burton offered no . excuses after seeing his hopes of judo gold shattered with defeat to . Canadian Antoine Valois-Fortier in the men's under-81kg. Burton, . 33, had once been ranked as high as fourth in his weight division, but . last year struggled to make an impact at either the European or World . Championships. Valois-Fortier was not the expected . opposition for the Scotsman, after knocking out Elnur Mammadli of . Azerbaijan, the reigning European champion who won Olympic gold at . under-73kg in Beijing. However, . the Canadian again produced the goods, this time with an ippon throw to . end Burton's Olympic dream before it had the chance to get going. 'I . lost in the biggest tournament in the world, the biggest Britain is . ever going to see in my lifetime, I don't really know what else to say, . but that is judo, people can get caught,' said Burton, who was choking . back the tears afterwards. Howell bows out of the 2012 Olympics, but said she was already thinking about the next Games in Rio . Great Britain's Euan Burton (in blue) was defeated by Canada's Antonie Valois-Fortier in the men's 81kg category today . 'I have caught people quickly in the past, and people have caught me quickly before. The fight was pretty even up to that point, but I felt I was going to be able to dominate the fight. I did not feel any particular threat until then, but it was a beautiful bit of judo.' Burton felt he was in top condition to deliver. 'I felt fantastic, my preparation probably could not have gone any better, that is the most disappointing thing,' he said. 'If I had poor preparation, things had not gone well, then you can use all of the excuses, but there are no excuses. 'I came in feeling one million percent that I could win the tournament and that I was in the best shape of my life. 'If you are in the best shape of your life and you go out in the first round, then maybe that is telling you something.' Valois-Fortier (right), who had defeated the reigning European champion in the first round, won the bout by Ippon . Elsewhere on the fourth day of the Olympics in London, Britain picked up their fourth medal with silver in the equestrian three-day eventing. The British quintet, which includes the Queen's granddaughter Zara Phillips, finished second behind Germany. Tina Cook entered the final showjumping round knowing a run consisting of less than seven points would earn Team GB silver and she responded with just one time penalty to the delight of the home crowd. Their brave gold medal challenge ultimately came up short as European champions and Olympic title favourites Germany took gold, with New Zealand clinching bronze. David Florence crashed out of the canoe slalom after finishing below the cut-off qualification time for the final. The 29-year-old from Aberdeen is the world number one but his effort of 106.16 seconds, including a two second penalty, wasn't good enough. He has another chance of a medal when . he competes in the semi-final of the C2 - the two-man boat - on . Thursday with team-mate Richard Hounslow. Florence . said: 'I am very disappointed obviously that it didn't go well enough. I . have wanted to perform at this event for the last four years and not to . do so is very frustrating. 'But . it's part of the sport of canoe slalom - some days it doesn't go your . way. As far as I am aware, I didn't go fast enough anywhere on the whole . course. There wasn't one mistake that cost me time, it was the whole . way. 'All I was trying to do was put in a . great run the whole way and that is all I was really concentrating on. It's easy to say it was the pressure of the home crowd (that got to me) but this is a very up and down sport and today I wasn't good enough.' Highlights . later in the day include the women's team gymnastics final and the . women's football match at Wembley between GB and Brazil.

A severely disabled California woman who was allegedly beaten by her 11-year-old son has died, according to police. Authorities said 51-year-old Tracey Gipaya, of Elk Grove, passed away from a per-existing condition and they do not expect to file any new charges against the boy. The child was arrested at his elementary school last week for allegedly beating his own mother so badly that she was sent to a hospital. Tragic end: Tracey Gipaya passed away from a per-existing condition after allegedly being beaten by her young son at their Elk Grove home . The 11-year-old has been charged with assault with a deadly weapon and elder abuse. ‘She did have injuries to her arms, to . her legs, to her back and other areas that we believe were a direct . result of her son causing the abuse,’ Elk Grove Police Officer Chris . Trim told CBS Sacramento. On Monday, the boy’s father was given temporary custody of his son by a juvenile court judge. The . 11-year-old’s biological sister from Southern California was also in . court pleading with the judge to release the boy into her custody, but . her request was denied. Despite his young age, prosecutors say the child was his mother’s primary caregiver and looked after the home they shared. His name has not been released due to his young age and his mother’s disabilities. The . boy was arrested last Monday after officers visited his mother and . talked to him at school. Details about the mother's disability have not . been released. Charged: Officers arrested the 11-year-old after visiting him at Foulks Ranch Elementary School, in Elk Grove, California . A third party told police about the suspected abuse, Trim told the Sacramento Bee. Mr Trim called it one of the more unusual cases he has seen. Weapon: The boy is accused of beating his mother with an extension cord . ‘Typically the situation is reversed,' he said. ‘A kid will go to school with marks or bruises, and someone calls police and the parent is arrested.’ Officers who investigated the abuse report ‘confirmed that the mother had been beaten on more than one occasion’ by her son with an extension cord eight to ten feet long and equipped with several outlets, Mr Trim said. The mother suffered physical injuries to her arms, legs, feet, chest and groin area, worsened by her medical condition. Authorities said another person took care of the woman from time to time, but it was not known how long the boy had been involved or if authorities were aware of the situation. Laura McCasland, a spokeswoman for the county Department of Health and Human Services, said she was unfamiliar with the case. However, child labor laws prohibit anyone under age 14 from working as a caregiver through the In-Home Supportive Services program, she said. The mother likely will qualify for help through California's Adult Protective Services program designed to ensure the safety of dependent adults, the newspaper reported. ‘There is quite a bit more to it, and it's very sad,’ Mr Trim said. ‘As tragic as it is, fortunately we do not have a death and we can step in and provide resources to the victim and hopefully to the offender as well.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Tracey Gipaya, 51, was hospitalized after allegedly being beaten with an extension cord .

A homeowner has become the first person  to win a payout from Npower for harassment and breach of contract after being mis-sold a tariff by a doorstep salesman. David Osborn, 59, won his four-year legal  battle against the energy giant after the cheap rate he signed up to failed to materialise. The 59-year-old was instead put on a tariff that would potentially cost an extra £2,000 over the two-and-a-half year contract. David Osborn with some of the letters npower sent him. He has become the first person to win a payout from an energy company for harassment . When he refused to pay the difference, Npower began chasing him for payment, hiring ten debt collection agencies to pursue him. Mr Osborn took his case to the small claims court, which awarded him £1,000 compensation for breach of contract and harassment. Yesterday, the safety and environmental consultant said that the company’s tactics had been ‘truly frightening’. ‘We were threatened that people may come to our house with a magistrate’s warrant and forcibly enter our home to disconnect our gas and electricity,’ he said. ‘This was a truly frightening prospect. My wife and children were scared to open the front door in case bailiffs came bursting in. We were so concerned we were going to be left in the dark without power or heating.’ Mr Osborn originally signed up to a price plan named Price Fix 2011 when a doorstep salesman called at his house in Longwell Green, Bristol, in 2008. Under the terms of the deal, he would pay just 7.5p per kilowatt of electricity and 2p per kilowatt of gas until 2011. Strong-willed David triumphed over npower in a landmark legal wrangle, after a four-year battle over a door-to-door sales contract . Father-of-two David said: 'I don’t . normally give doorstep salesmen the time of day but I was very . dissatisfied with my supplier as they always seemed to be holding . several hundred pounds of my money in credit. 'I told him that I would take the npower package provided I could pay my bills by online banking, rather than direct debit. 'He agreed, we shook hands and I signed up.' However, he was later told this tariff had been withdrawn and that he had been placed on the standard rate, which was twice as expensive. David refused to pay the extra and instead only paid what he should have been under the terms of the Price Fix 2011 plan. But . by February 2009 he had received a letter from npower demanding he pay . £332.93 or they would enter his house and cut off his gas and . electricity supply. Mr Osborn contacted the Energy Ombudsman before launching civil proceedings. He claimed Npower had breached its contract and Section 3 of the Protection from Harassment Act. David eventually accrued a ‘debt’ of . £2,000 and the family received over 60 letters from npower and were . repeatedly threatened with bailiffs. The father was informed that the Price Fix 2011 had been withdrawn and . he had instead been placed on the company's standard tariff . In his witness statement submitted to Bristol County Court in July, David said he felt 'bullied and intimidated' by npower. He said: 'At no time in my life have I ever been in debt to anyone or any organisation. 'I have never used credit or hire purchase arrangements to acquire any goods or services (apart from my mortgage). 'I most certainly have never been on the receiving end of debt collection activities. 'I . can confirm that it is a horrible, demeaning and stressful experience . to go through - and it is particularly frustrating when you know you . have done nothing wrong and are not actually in debt, simply standing up . for a point of principle.' Deputy District Judge O’Neill ruled at Bristol County Court in July that the contract was binding and Npower should pay £1,000 compensation. A spokesman for Npower said it considered the court’s decision over the issue of harassment ‘to be in error’. ‘We settled with the customer, taking into account the time it took to resolve his complaint,’ he added. 'All issues have been reported back to the business to review its procedures.' But David, who is the first person to successfully take npower to court, is still unhappy. He said: 'They state that they consider the court’s decision to be in error. 'Well, if they didn’t like the court’s judgement there’s is a well-established mechanism in this country for appeal. 'It’s . disgraceful that a large organisation like npower can just cock a snoot . at a Court of Law and tell them that they’re wrong.' He is now with First Utility, and is 'over the moon' with their services and his £143 monthly bill for their detached home. Npower was fined £1.8million by watchdog OFGEM for mis-selling doorstep policies in December 2008. After . originally saying that they believed the court's decision was . erroneous, a spokesperson for Npower said in a statement: 'This was a . genuine dispute over the tariff he originally signed up to npower with. 'We're pleased that the matter is now resolved and Mr Osborn has been compensated for the mis-selling of the tariff.

A 27-year-old woman suffering from a rare cancer is desperate to raise £25,000 to fund an operation that could save her life. Laura Baxter was diagnosed with cancer of the appendix last year, which affects just one in two million people. She had surgery to remove the deadly cancerous tissue in June but was told it had started to regrow in August. Experts now say she has just six to eight months to live. But determined not to give up hope, Laura, of St Ives, Cambridgeshire, found a top doctor in Belgium who believes he can save her life. The operation alone will cost £25,000, however, while she will need extra cash to cover flights.Laura and her friends and family have so far collected about £7,000 towards their vital target. Determined: Laura, with her pet dog, and with boyfriend Wayne Cooper, says she is not ready to give up fighting . Miss Baxter said last night from her . bed in Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge: 'The operation in Belgium is . with the hope of removing all or controlling the cancer. 'I don't know which it will be yet, but doing nothing... it will kill me. 'Doctors in Belgium are confident they can do a good job to hopefully remove it. I'm guessing that this is my last chance.' Courageous Laura added: 'It's either that or admit defeat. What would other people do at my age and in my situation? 'I'm not ready to just give up.' Pseudomyxoma peritonei, or PMP is a cancer of the appendix. It usually starts as a small growth that breaks through the appendix wall and spreads tumour cells to the lining of the abdominal cavity. It produces a mucus, which contains the cancer cells, that spreads to the abdominal organs such as the intestines, liver and pancreas. In June, Laura had a nine-hour operation at Basingstoke Hospital - one of two PMP specialist centres in the UK - to remove her affected organs, including parts of her small intestine. The surgeon left small bits of . cancerous tissue because of the length of surgery amid hopes of not . damaging more of her liver and small intestine. Doctors tried to kill the remaining cancerous cells through heated chemotherapy treatment. But . in August, Miss Baxter was told the cancer had started to grow again in . her bowel and was given six to eight months to live by doctors at . Addenbrooke's . Giving hope: Prof Dr Wim Ceelen at Gent University Hospital, Belgium, believes he can help Laura . Laura, . who works for golf ball manufacturer Titleist in St Ives, refused to . accept the diagnosis and looked for doctors overseas who would be able . to operate. 'When the . cancer started growing back where they left it on the bowel and liver, I . was told there was not going to be a second operation,' she said. 'Basingstoke . and the Christie in Manchester - the other PMP specialist hospital - . don't feel they can operate because of where the cancer is. 'They don't have the expertise.' After . desperately searching for doctors in Switzerland, Germany and America, . Laura found Prof Wim Ceelen at Gent University Hospital, Belgium. Prof Ceelan has carried out more than 450 of the operations that Laura needs. Her mother Jacky Baxter said: 'We have to raise the money for her. Some days I wake up and think it's a dream and then I realise it's actually happening. 'It's absolutely devastating for it to happen to someone so young. 'There are times when Laura seems to be coping, then the next moment she is very angry and cries. 'She asks - why is it happening to me? What have I done to deserve this? 'She's a nice girl and hasn't done anything, so it's very hard.' Mrs Baxter added: 'The doctors at Addenbrooke's have said they don't have the knowledge and they say that if they operate, Laura will die on the table. 'But the doctor in Belgium says they have done the operation before and it will be successful. 'The NHS won't pay for the operation because Addenbrooke's says the cancer is terminal, but they have said they will reimburse her part of the money if she survives. 'That money would then be given to the Pseudomyxoma Survivors charity to put the money into research to stop this from happening to anyone else.' Laura would have her operation within two weeks before spending a month in hospital in Gent recovering if she can raise the money.

A California couple have welcomed home the healthiest set of quintuplets ever born according to doctors, in addition to their big sister Gianna. Returning to their Fullerton home on Wednesday Meryl and John Ferraro were greeted by a banner reading 'Welcome home GRACE + 1.' With so many children, three girls and two boys in addition to their two-year-old big sister Gianna, the parents say it may be easier to refer to them all using a simple acronym for: Gabrielle, Riley, Addison, Cooper and Emerson. Scroll down for video . Happy family: Meryl and John Ferraro sit among their new family of six children, with oldest Gianna seated between one-month-old infants Gabrielle, Riley, Addison, Cooper and Emerson . Miracle babies: Mrs Ferraro nearly lost her babies 18 weeks in after a doctor found her prematurely dilating, undergoing what would be a life-saving surgery their doctor didn't think they'd survive . 'We figured we would eventually forget their names, so if we yell ""GRACE"" they'd all come running,' Mrs Ferraro playfully told CBS Los Angeles. Today appearing in good spirits with the added assistance of community members donating time, money and household baby items, it was just one month ago she gave birth via C-section to the healthy brood at an Arizona hospital. After several hours of labour, it took less than three minutes to deliver all five with '24 people or so in the Operating room, and another 40-50 people in the baby recovery room,' writes the proud father in their family blog. But that can't hold a candle to the both physically and emotionally intense pregnancy the mother had to first fight through. Lined up: All five babies are seen wearing the first letters of their names as Gabrielle, Riley, Addison, Cooper and Emerson . One name: Returning from the hospital on Wednesday the family were greeted by this banner reading 'welcome home GRACE + 1,' an acronym for all of their children's names . After several miscarriages and years trying to give birth, it was an infertility specialist in December of 2008 that brought them their oldest daughter, Gianna. - Father John Ferraro . Trying again, it was earlier this year they found themselves successfully pregnant again. Successful at least, until the first ultrasound found two sets of heartbeats that gradually escalated to five bringing a number shockingly unexpected by the couple - though joyfully welcome - even with their doctor's grim warning. 'He spent over an hour telling us all the statistics and dangers that faced our little ones; blindness, cerebral palsy, hearing loss, autism, mental retardation, even death. 'He said he supported us with whatever decision we made, but he clearly implied that fetal reduction as the best option for having healthy babies. Keeping all 5 was too risky and the statistics showed that at least 2-3 of our babies would have significant health issues,' Mr Ferraro wrote. Loved: Two-year-old big sister Gianna kisses the head of one of her younger siblings who underwent a difficult pregnancy and nearly didn't make it . Welcome home! Two of Mr and Mrs Ferraro's infants are seen after their return home on Wednesday . Big success: With the couple having tried unsuccessfully for years to have children their birth is a miracle in many ways . With a doctor suggesting they, in Mr Ferraro's words, 'choose which of our babies would live and which ones would die,' after traumatic thought and consideration, they decided in the end: 'if God was giving us 5 babies, there was a reason.' Gabrielle:  4lbs, 6oz and 18 1/4 inches . Riley:  5lbs, 7oz and 18 inches . Addision:  4lbs, 2oz and 17 1/4 inches . Cooper:  5lbs even and 18 1/2 inches . Emerson:  4lbs, 8oz and 18 inches . The couple's struggle didn't end there though. In June, 18 weeks into their pregnancy, their doctor issued another warning to the couple after an ultrasound. Mrs Ferraro's cervix was opening up, dilating to 4cm by the next day with her amniotic fluid or bag of water seen 'bulging out like a balloon,' according to the father. Undergoing an emergency surgery to close the expanding gap that would otherwise cause her to go into premature labour, losing the babies, their doctor later said he didn't think the babies would last more than a week. But they did. Speedy delivery! All five babies were delivered in under three minutes' time while weighing 4-5lbs . Proud pop: The beaming father looks down on one of his five newborns at an Arizona hospital last month . Temporarily relocating to Mesa, Arizona for their delivery, following their doctor's move, on September 26th, Mrs Ferraro gave birth to the quintuplets all weighing between four and five pounds. Returning home this week, they also arrived 'a full 8 days gestational age prior to the previous record for a set of Quintuplets,' the overjoyed father wrote, making them ‘the healthiest set of Quintuplets ever born.’ 'I don't use the term loosely but these five babies are truly miracles,' Dr John Elliot said at a press conference following. 'Just the fact that they made it this far and that they were all home within three weeks is just crazy. I mean it’s truly a miracle. They’re all healthy,' Mrs Ferraro told CBS. ‘Our first goal was to get them out healthy. ... Now, the fun begins, she told OC Register.

A new mother has claimed she almost died when she collapsed with part of the placenta still in her womb. Megan Hubbard began haemorrhaging in a restaurant two weeks after giving birth to baby George last month. Miss Hubbard had returned five times to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Woolwich where she had given birth to complain of heavy bleeding, but was told it was 'normal'. Megan Hubbard, with partner Dan Hunter, claims she almost died when she collapsed with part of the placenta still in her womb after giving birth to her son George . The 23-year-old, of Thamesmead, south London, said that despite having a normal birth she experienced a lot of bleeding after returning home. She said: 'I went back to the hospital five times and they sent me home each time saying ""it’s normal to bleed after having a baby""'. On September 24 Miss Hubbard returned to the hospital’s accident and emergency department concerned about the bleeding. She claims she was told she had a womb infection and discharged with antibiotics. Later that day, the mother-of-one visited a restaurant to celebrate the birth of her son with her family. As she finished her dinner she suddenly collapsed due to a haemorrhage, she says caused by placenta being left in her womb. She says she lost three-and-a-half litres of blood in the incident and required a blood transfusion when she arrived at hospital. Miss Hubbard was told the heavy bleeding she was experiencing was 'normal' Normally, the placenta separates from the uterine wall during delivery and is expelled from the vagina within 20 minutes after giving birth. If pieces of the placenta remain in the uterus (called retained placenta), it can lead to infection. If haemorrhage begins a week or two after delivery, it may be caused by a piece of the placenta that has remained in the uterus. If so, the tissue will be removed surgically. Miss Hubbard said: 'What really scares me is that I could have been in the car with my son when it happened. 'The hospital has failed me - they said it was a womb infection and I nearly lost my life from it. I've still had no apology from them.' She added that the time spent in hospital recovering from the haemorrhage had caused been incredibly traumatic. 'I was away from my baby quite a bit in those two weeks because I was really weak and had no strength at all. 'It stopped me bonding with him.' Miss Hubbard has written to the head of midwifery at the hospital to complain about what happened and is considering taking legal action. She praised the staff at the Toby Carvery restaurant, who had called for help immediately. 'They did an amazing job and an off-duty nurse got me breathing more strongly until the ambulance arrived. 'I want to thank them and to say how disgusted I am with Queen Elizabeth Hospital.' A South London Healthcare Trust spokesman said: 'We are investigating the circumstances around the care and treatment of Ms Hubbard. 'The Trust has spoken to her this week and we are making progress with looking into whether there are any aspects of her care which should have been done differently.'","Megan Hubbard complained several times about bleeding after giving birth .

An embalmer who lost his license after graphic remarks he made about dead bodies were published in a Boston newspaper has had the decision overturned by the highest court in Massachusetts. Troy Schoeller’s license was revoked by a state board in 2010 after the panel found he violated its code of conduct by talking about bodies in his care in an 'unprofessional' manner. Schoeller was quoted in Boston newspaper The Phoenix referring to the body of a baby as a 'bearskin rug.' He also said he hated embalming fat people. Free speech: Troy Schoeller has had a decision to strip him of his embalming license overturned . The Massachusetts Board of Registration of Funeral Directors and Embalmers claimed that Schoeller violated their code of conduct . Schoeller argued that his constitutional right to free speech was violated by the board. The Supreme Judicial Court on Friday found that the code of conduct prohibiting 'unprofessional' or 'undignified and salacious' comments is overboard and unconstitutional because it restricts a 'substantial amount of protected speech.' Schoeller argued that state regulators chose to enforce a vague and overly broad provision of the code of conduct that prohibits funeral directors and embalmers from commenting on the condition of a body entrusted to their care. Funeral directors and embalmers routinely talk about their work in trade journals and other publications to inform a curious public, and the provision should not be interpreted as barring them from ever talking publicly about what they do, said his lawyer, Jason Benzaken. Schoeller was the first embalmer in Massachusetts to be disciplined on those grounds. 'I didn't lie about anything,' said Schoeller prior to today’s verdict. 'I didn't say anything that was wrong.' Although he admitted that he could have chosen his words more carefully. Outside of his embalming work Schoeller fronts a thrash metal band . called Beware! and . a hardcore band called Hardly . Schoeller on the baby 'that looked like a bearskin rug': . 'I had to rebuild it in nine hours. I . used everything: duct tape, masking tape, tissue builder, wound filler. ... I put, like, coat hangers and caulk in there and put him into a . little baby outfit. ... He looked awesome.' Schoeller on embalming fat people: . 'And I really hate embalming fat people, like people who weigh 300 . pounds. Because when you cut open a fat person butter leaks out. Literally, yellow oil leaks out of the wound and floats on top of the . water. If you put butter in the microwave and put it in the water, it . turns into little balls - fat globules - and that’s what comes out of . fat dead people. It’s so nasty.' Schoeller's statements were truthful, . did not disclose confidential information and pertained to a matter of . 'legitimate public concern,' and were therefore protected by the First . Amendment and the state constitution, Benzaken said. 'People are interested in it; people have a right to know what happens to their deceased family members when they are brought into a funeral home,' he said. The state Board of Registration of Funeral Directors and Embalmers claimed that Schoeller violated their code of conduct. 'Sensitivity, dignity, respect are at the very heart of this profession,' Assistant Attorney General Sookyoung Shin said. 'If his comments are OK, then any funeral director or embalmer in the state would have license to go out and describe the types of bodies that he finds nasty or that he finds amusing,' Shin said during arguments before the Supreme Judicial Court in January. Schoeller, 35, worked as an embalmer for 13 years in Florida and Massachusetts before his license was revoked in 2010. He said he agreed to be interviewed by The Phoenix, an alternative weekly newspaper, after he opened a clothing store called Horror Business in Boston in 2006. Schoeller said the reporter took notes during their first meeting so he knew whatever he said could be published. He said the second meeting was in a restaurant and much more casual, and he did not realize for much of the evening that the reporter was recording their conversation. Schoeller said he would have used different language if he had realized his comments were going to be published. Phoenix Editor-in-Chief Carly Carioli disputed Schoeller's claims. 'Schoeller's account is simply not true,' Carioli said. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has ruled to overturn Schoeller's ban . In the article, Schoeller discusses his specialty - reconstructive art - describing how he works to restore traumatized bodies. He also made graphic remarks about how the bodies of overweight people react to the embalming process - describing it, among other things, as 'nasty' - and offered crude descriptions of his biological reactions to the fumes emanating from bodies. Schoeller said his remarks were an . attempt to show how he took pride in his work and how it is an art to . him. He said he did not identify anyone in his remarks to the reporter. The article also revealed that Schoeller goes by the nickname Rot, which he has tattooed on his back. He also fronts a thrash metal band called Beware!, while wearing a priest collar and covered in fake blood, and another band called Hardly. Schoeller said his remarks were an attempt to show how he took pride in his work and how it is an art to him .","Troy Schoeller, who also plays in a thrash metal band, made the controversial comments in a Boston newspaper .

Elidon Habilaj, 35, an Albanian accused of faking his UK application by posing as a Kosovan asylum-seeker 13 years ago, failed to show for his court case. He worked for the Metropolitan Police before transferring to an office job with SOCA, which deals with criminal networks including those based in the Balkans. The Serious and Organised Crime Agency was launched in 2006 to tackle 21st century crime. Director-General Bill Hughes, pictured, was in charge of the agency until 2010 . But, after suspicions were aroused, he was ‘watched’ as part of a SOCA inquiry – even though the agency was unaware he actually worked for them. After he was exposed Habilaj, of Wanstead, East London, was bailed and fled abroad, possibly to his homeland, despite not having his passport. He has renounced his UK citizenship and applied for an Albanian passport. Habilaj faces charges including using false details to obtain leave to enter or remain in the UK from 1998 to 2011 and fraud. Judge Martyn Zeidman QC said his trial could proceed in his absence in January. He said: ‘On the face of . it if he chooses not to attend court I can’t see any reason why the . trial shouldn’t go ahead in his absence. ‘That’s not a decision I will make now. The trial judge will make that decision and he (Habilaj) should be made aware of that. ‘As he is not here today I issue a bench warrant not backed for bail.’ Elidon Habilaj was a clerical worker at the Serious Organised Crime Agency until last year . Prosecutor Richard Sampson told Snaresbrook Crown Court today: ‘This is a case that involves effectively a false asylum claim. ‘The crown say Mr Habilaj managed to gain employment with the Serious Organised Crime Agency using a fraudulent application. ‘Effectively the offence was picked up in due course and he was arrested. ‘The matter has been rumbling on since last year since it was listed at the magistrates’ court. ‘He was requested to attend and the officers requested him to attend. ‘The officers are here but the defendant is not.’ Manjit Dogra, for Habilaj, said: ‘The . matter was put for a pre-trial review on September 21, when the . defendant was asked by the defence to confirm he was required to attend . today’s hearing. ‘An email was sent and he was notified in writing via email at an address he regularly uses.’ At an earlier hearing, Crown lawyer Christiaan Moll said it was a ‘very sensitive case’.

Concerns: Former UN chief Kofi Annan has said that many countries receiving aid from Britain can fend for themselves . Former United Nations chief Kofi Annan has backed calls for Britain and the EU to stop giving millions  of pounds in aid to wealthy countries. He said booming nations such as China, Brazil and India should wean themselves off development funding so it could be targeted at ‘weaker’ parts of the world instead. His comments come after International Development Secretary Justine Greening called for the European Union to stop giving aid to relatively rich nations. She travelled to Luxembourg last week to say it is wrong that the EU’s aid fund, to which the UK contributes more than £1billion a year, sends money to relatively rich countries such as Barbados, Iceland, China and Brazil. Britain refuses to fund such countries out of its own aid budget. However, the UK is still sending around £280million a year to India – even though the country can afford its own space programme and its president, Pranab Mukherjee, said in February: ‘We do not require the aid. It is a peanut in our total development expenditure.’ Conservative backbenchers want to see the Coalition drop its pledge to increase spending on foreign aid year-on-year, while cutting funding in every other department apart from the NHS. In 2014, taxpayers will be forking out £12.6billion a year on foreign aid – more than the £12.1billion it will be spending on the police. Mr Annan, a Ghanaian who was the UN secretary general from 1997 to 2006, said not all the countries who received aid from British taxpayers needed it. ‘The emerging markets and the countries that are doing well should wean themselves off aid,’  he said. ‘Countries like Brazil, China, India, Ghana, Guatemala and Honduras; some of these countries can fend for themselves. 'In fact I have had the chance to suggest to some of them that they should not accept Britain’s aid willingly. They need to say “We are full enough”, so that there will be more money available for the really poor and weaker.’ A sixth of the money spent by the Department for International Development goes to the EU’s aid programme. Half of this £10billion budget is spent on middle and higher income countries, even though many say they are too wealthy to merit support. Pledge: Justine Greening headed to Luxembourg this week to call for EU funding to stop for richer countries . Brussels has committed £30million to numerous aid projects in China, which has almost 150 billionaires, and more than £10million to Brazil, which will spend £9billion on its 2016 Olympics and whose GDP overtook Britain’s last year. But Mr Annan, who quit his job as Syrian peace envoy in August, also warned that governments rarely deliver all the aid they have promised. Speaking at the Cheltenham Literature Festival earlier this month, he added: ‘The G8 and the G20 make lots of noise, lots of publicity about aid which is not in the end delivered.’ In recent weeks, it has emerged that British taxpayers’ money has been splashed out on a string of projects in wealthy countries, while domestic cuts continue apace. Among the projects being paid for by the EU are a scheme promoting tourism in an Icelandic national park and a pro-EU television series in Turkey. And £1.8million has been handed to the Caribbean island of Barbados to build a hotel and leisure complex where 200 young people will be trained each year in ‘hospitality management’. Some £800,000 out of the EU aid budget is going on a water park being built in Morocco by the French owners of Center Parcs. At the Tory conference earlier this month, Miss Greening said: ‘I want to be clear that whether we give a pound directly, or through another organisation, I always expect value for money on behalf of the taxpayer. ‘I want to bring that same focus on value for money in the UK to the EU in Brussels. I don’t think it’s right that the EU still gives money to those countries higher up the income scale, when we’ve taken the decision to target the poorest.’ The Department for International Development has spent £500million on so-called ‘poverty barons’, private consultants running aid programmes abroad. Meanwhile, millions in aid was last month pledged to help expand an oil plant in India part-owned by the UK’s richest man, billionaire steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal.","He has even suggested to countries like Brazil and Ghana not to accept Britain's aid .

NFL Hall of Famer Lawrence Taylor celebrated with a cigar on Friday and pledged to concentrate on his 'broken life' after a jury rejected a woman's claims that he assaulted her by failing to recognize her distress when he had sex with her in a hotel room when she was 16 years old. The jury in U.S. District Court in Manhattan deliberated for about an hour before siding with Taylor, who appeared relieved as he turned around and gave a thumbs-up to a friend on a court bench behind him. Outside court, Taylor signed a copy of the verdict sheet belonging to his lawyer, Arthur Aidala, and then spoke about his future and his past. Acquitted: Former New York Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor smokes a cigar as he leaves federal Friday in New York after winning a lawsuit against him . All smiles: Taylor, pictured walking out of Manhattan Federal Court today, left, and right, texting on his phone . Taylor, led the New York Giants to Super Bowl titles in 1987 and 1991, said he wanted to go home to Broward County, Fla., and 'concentrate on my own broken life and try to repair that.' Asked to elaborate, he said: 'I've done a lot of things I need to address. I look forward to going home.' Outside the courthouse, Taylor, whose post-NFL life has been marred by missteps including drug and tax charges, smoked a cigar. When asked what kind, he said, 'Redemption.' The verdict came after a four-day trial in which Taylor testified that he had sex with a 'very, very pretty' prostitute in 2010 but denied accusations that he ignored obvious signs she was a teen runaway who had been beaten and forced to meet with him. He said she told him she was 19. The meeting occurred in his room at a Holiday Inn in Montebello, just north of New York City, where he paid $300 to Cristina Fierro after the sexual encounter. Fierro said another man forced her to have sex with Taylor. She said she brought the lawsuit to hold Taylor accountable. Accuser: Cristina Fierro, right, said she didn't . know who Taylor was when she went to his hotel room and found him naked . in bed in the 2010 incident . NFL icon: Taylor played for 13 seasons in the NFL and has two Super Bowl rings that he won with the New York Giants . The Associated Press doesn't normally . publish the names of accusers in sexual-assault cases unless they agree . to be named or identify themselves publicly, as Fierro has done. Fierro's lawyer could not immediately be reached for comment after the verdict. Taylor, though, said he regretted that he did not know when he met Fierro about the true circumstances of their meeting. 'I feel for what she has gone . through,' he said. 'At the time, I wasn't a bad person, and if I had . known what was going on, I would have helped her. I hope the best for . her.' He shook his head as he spoke quietly about his missed opportunity. 'I'm a sensitive person. I love people,' he said. 'She was in good hands.' During the trial, Fierro wept as she . described the sexual encounter, saying the hulking Taylor failed to stop . having sex with her even after she told him it hurt and tried to push . him away. Accused: Taylor, pictured with attorney Arthur Aidala shortly after his arrest in May 2010, was charged with sexual misconduct and prostitution charges . 'I kept telling him I didn't want to be there,' she said. 'He's much bigger than me. I couldn't do anything.' Taylor testified that Fierro 'didn't seem to have a problem' and 'didn't tell me to stop.' Taylor, who played in the NFL for 13 . seasons and was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the NFL's . 75th Anniversary All-Time Team, had already pleaded guilty to . misdemeanor criminal charges of sexual misconduct and patronizing an . underage prostitute and is serving six years of probation. Outside court, he cited 'changing . times' and said there were many lessons to be learned from his encounter . with Fierro and everything that came afterward. 'We're not in the '80s. We're not in the '90s anymore,' he said. 'You have to govern yourself accordingly.' In his testimony, Taylor, . 53, told a Manhattan jury at a civil trial that he had a history of . hiring women for 'company' when on the road but didn't expect them to . automatically have sex with him. 'I . still like the chase,' Taylor testified. But he added, 'I like to stack . the odds in my favor... I don't like to work too hard.' Fall from grace: Taylor, who is considered to be . one of the greatest linebackers in the history of the NFL, was charged . with rape in May 2010 .

Back to court: Casey Anthony seen leaving the Orange County Jail after acquitted of murder in July of 2011, may soon return to court on a defamation charge . Casey Anthony will be denied a fair trial if it's not moved from its current venue in Central Florida, her attorneys said this week. In paperwork filed this week her attorneys asked to have the trial moved out of Orange County arguing that Anthony would not receive an impartial jury due to pretrial publicity. Anthony was acquitted last year of murder in the death of her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee, a ruling that sparked outrage and even death threats against the now 26-year-old spanning across the country. Her attorneys argue 'the local media refuses to move on' and that the public feels as though 'justice was not served' in the criminal case, the Orlando Sentinel reports. After Caylee disappeared in the summer of 2008, Anthony first told investigators that a babysitter named Zenaida Gonzalez had kidnapped the toddler. Pointing fingers: Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez, seen in 2009, claims Anthony ruined her reputation when she falsely told authorities she had kidnapped her toddler . Ms Gonzalez later sued Anthony, claiming her reputation had been ruined. Seeking punitive damage against Anthony, Ms Gonzalez’ Attorney John Dill said he does fully expects to hear 'Miss Anthony has no money,' but they plan to seek 'the source of the Casey Anthony trust fund,’ along with ‘any income from any book deals or publicity.' 'Today's hearings were not all that significant,' Anthony's attorney Andrew J Chmelier told the media outside the courtroom, 'but certainly we're obligated to make objections when we think they're appropriate.' The lawsuit is set for trial in January. Killed: Two-year-old Caylee Anthony disappeared in 2008 before she was found dead, duck tape covering her mouth, but with no one convicted in her murder . 'We're subpoenaing here, we want her to be there, we hope she'll testify,’ said Mr Dill. Mr Chmelier disagreed suggesting that her safety may prove otherwise. 'Her safety is a primary concern, above anything that happens here, we have a duty and obligation to make sure that she is safe,' he said.","Zenaida Gonzalez claims Anthony ruined her reputation when falsely telling authorities she kidnapped her two-year-old daughter Caylee .

Two British soldiers shot dead last week in Afghanistan may have been the victims of a revenge attack by local police. Corporal Channing Day, 25, of 3 Medical Regiment and Corporal David O’Connor, 27, of 40 Com-mando, Royal Marines, were previously thought to have been caught up in a so-called ‘friendly fire’ incident. But after interviewing witnesses and recovering fragments of ammunition, Royal Military Police investigators have ruled out the theory that the pair were shot by British Forces. Killed: Female medic Channing Day, 25, from Comber in County Down, Northern Ireland, has been shot dead while on patrol in in Afghanistan . Tragic: Miss Day (centre) smiling with friends in a photo posted on Facebook . Last night a Ministry of Defence spokeswoman confirmed that the deaths were caused by ‘a third party... not UK personnel’. Military detectives are exploring whether the soldiers were killed after British troops shot dead an Afghan policeman. And Defence Secretary Philip Hammond – . asked whether the British personnel had been killed in a ‘green on . blue’ attack, when Afghan personnel turn on their British partners – . said: ‘There is a possibility that that is what has happened but it is . not clear at this stage.’ Corporal Channing Day (left), 25, and Corporal . David O'Connor (right), 27, are believed to have been shot dead by an . Afghan policeman . Sporty: Channing Day dreamed of joining the army since she was a schoolgirl . On Wednesday morning, Cpl Day and Cpl O’Connor were patrolling through the district of Nahr-e Saraj in Helmand Province. Military sources say that when the . patrol reached the village of Char Kutsa they saw an Afghan male . crouching on the bank of a stream. The man was shot dead and later . identified as a local police officer. An Army source said: ‘The man wasn’t wearing a uniform, so there was no way of knowing he was an off-duty policeman. ‘It now seems that he was washing, a . ritual before conducting daily prayers. If the soldiers saw him with a . weapon he might have been mistaken for Taliban. Misson: Investigators were today interviewing survivors of the firefight amid the conflicting claims about what happened . At work: Channing Day was killed alongside a Royal Marine in the attack . ‘The investigation is focusing on the reasons for the decision to open fire and what happened next. ‘Other Afghan police or villagers . reacted badly to this mistaken shooting, believing they were all under . attack. The situation was messy and confusing.’ The Ministry spokeswoman added: ‘Further investigation into the involvement or otherwise of the dead Afghan male is on-going. ‘Analysis of the events surrounding . this complex incident continues and is likely to take some time while . forensic and other tests are carried out.’ Tragic: The family of Channing Day, pictured with her mother Rosemary, have been informed of her death . Loss: British Soldier Channing Day (centre) who was killed in Afghanistanypctured with friends on her Facebook page . Channing Day harboured a schoolgirl dream of joining the Army, a teacher at her former school said. As a bubbly and sporty teenager in Northern Ireland she completed work experience with the forces in 2002 and worked well with everybody there, Strangford College acting principal Paul Maxwell added. She was always physically fit and achieved top grades in PE, excelling at gymnastics, trampolining and netball. Mr Maxwell said: 'She always said she wanted to join the Army, she was pretty much focused on wanting to join the Army.' He said her sporting prowess revealed her gritty determination to succeed. 'It was not just that she was good but that she always showed commitment, she stayed after school and did all the practice,' he added. Ms Day left school at 16 and Mr Maxwell said he believed she went straight into the Army. The acting principal added: 'Every pupil is dear to us and I can remember Channing as if it was yesterday, somebody we remember as being young, and still so young, is suddenly killed in such a tragic way.' Cpl Day, from County Down, Northern . Ireland, was the third female member of British Forces to be killed on . operations in Afghanistan. Colleagues considered her a rising star and . she was an outstanding sportswoman. She joined the Army in 2005 and . deployed to Helmand Province at the beginning of October. She had completed previous tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. Cpl O’Connor, from Havant, Hampshire, was on his third tour of Afghanistan having joined the Royal Marines in 2002. He had deployed to Helmand at the end of September. A total of 435 British military personnel have been killed in Afghanistan since operations started in 2001. Yesterday Cpl Day’s sister, Lauren, said there were no words to describe the sadness felt by her family in Comber, County Down. She said: ‘We are an extremely close family and this has hit us all hard. ‘Channing loved the Army. If there . was one thing she knew growing up, it was that she wanted to be a . soldier – she would march around the living room and never missed . cadets. ‘Channing grew up into the bravest, beautiful, determined woman. ‘She has done more in her 25 years than most women her age and we are so very proud of everything she  has achieved.","Medic Channing Day and Corporal David O'Connor have both been killed .

The top . federal prosecutor in Manhattan announced Wednesday that he is suing Bank of America for more than $1 . billion for mortgage fraud against Fannie Mae and Freddie . Mac during the years around the financial crisis. U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said Countrywide Financial, which was later . bought by Bank of America, churned out mortgage loans from 2007 to 2009 . without making sure that borrowers could afford them. 'The . fraudulent conduct alleged in today’s complaint was spectacularly brazen . in scope,' Bharara said in a statement. He said the suit was partly to . recover money that Fannie and Freddie lost from defaulted loans. Foreclosure: An internal review at Countrywide found that 57 percent of Hustle loans went into default . U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara described the conduct of Countrywide as 'spectacularly brazen in scope' Bank of America had no immediate comment. Countrywide . sold the loans to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which were left to pay . for the loans when they defaulted, according to the lawsuit. Fannie and . Freddie were effectively nationalized in 2008. According . to the lawsuit, Countrywide used a process called 'the Hustle,' shorthand for 'High-Speed Swim Lane.' The idea was that mortgage loans, . as they were being processed, would 'move forward, never backward.' The . lawsuit alleged that Countrywide traded quantity for quality and . eliminated underwriters, even from mortgage loans for which borrowers . did not have to get their income verified. Instead, . loan processors simply entered data into an automated underwriting . system, and if the system gave the go-ahead, 'no underwriter would ever . see the loan,' the lawsuit alleged. With few checks and balances, there was 'widespread falsification' of the data entered into the program, Bharara charged. 'The Hustle': The idea behind Countrywide's scheme was that mortgage loans would 'move forward, never backward' Bank of America's share price over the past week . Loan . processors were given little guidance, the suit said: Checklists for . making sure that loans were compliant - for example, assessing whether . the income level that a borrower listed was reasonable - were . eliminated. Bonuses were based solely on how many loans an employee . could process, not the quality. The . lawsuit said that Countrywide executives were aware of the dangerous . path they were treading. For example, a quality review in January 2008 . showed that 57 percent of Hustle loans went into default. Instead of . notifying Fannie and Freddie, Countrywide instead set about concealing . the quality of the loans it was selling them, the suit said. It said . Countrywide even offered a bonus to quality-control workers who could 'rebut' the default rates that the review had found. The government-controlled mortgage buyers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had to be effectively nationalized in 2008 . Bank of America bought Countrywide Financial in July 2008 . The . lawsuit didn’t give specifics, but it accused Countrywide, and later . Bank of America, of selling 'thousands' of Hustle loans to Fannie and . Freddie. Bank of America bought Countrywide in July 2008. Fannie and . Freddie buy mortgage loans from banks, package them into securities and . sell them to investors. The idea is to free up banks to make more . loans. If a loan defaults, Fannie and Freddie guarantee payments to the . investors. According . to the lawsuit, Fannie and Freddie don’t review the loans before they . purchase them. Instead, they rely on banks’ statements that the loans . meet certain qualifications. Bharara . said the lawsuit was the first civil fraud suit brought by the Justice . Department concerning loans that were later sold to Fannie and Freddie.","Countrywide Financial - owned by Bank of America - sold mortgages without adequately checking if borrowers could pay .

According to Kennedy, he just wanted . to get his son some fresh air. The nurses claim he was violating . hospital policies. The confrontation resulted in a series of alarms at . the hospital, including a hospital-wide ‘code pink,’ which is used to . signal a baby's abduction. Defense attorney Robert Gottlieb . called the code pink ‘preposterous’ and pointed out that a hospital . guide says the purpose of the alarm is to reunite a baby with its . family. The nurses had claimed they classified the situation as a code pink because Kennedy had been ‘violently’ shaking the child. Gottlieb said nurse Anna Lane told Kennedy . she would not let him take the baby off the maternity floor, then chased . him as he headed for the exit, disabled an elevator and tried to block . the door to a stairwell. Lane said Kennedy twisted her arm in a struggle at the door. Gottlieb denied there was any injury. Nurse Cari Luciano, who is seen on surveillance video falling onto the . floor near the stairway, said that happened when Kennedy kicked her as . she reached for the baby in Kennedy's arms. Hospital: Mr Kennedy is shown in security footage trying to take his newborn son for a walk . Violence: One of the nurses is seen on the ground after she was allegedly kicked by Kennedy at the hospital elevator . But Gottlieb said it was a push rather than a kick and was an instinctive reaction of a father trying to protect his baby. Kennedy also fell when that happened, but kept hold of the baby. Prosecutors said his actions endangered the boy. ‘The fact that the baby was not injured is a miracle,’ said Assistant District Attorney Amy Puerto. Gottlieb alleged that when the nurses realized the hospital would . investigate the incident, they ‘join together, get their stories . straight and pressure the district attorney's office to bring charges.’ He said they'd been told that any potential lawsuit would have a better chance if a criminal conviction came first. ‘It's an embarrassment that two nurses would so blatantly lie,’ Gottlieb said. However, Puerto said that argument was ‘a classic case of blaming the victims.’ 'We were attacked': Anna Margaret Lane, left, . and Cari Maleman Luciano, right, were involved in the alleged scuffle on January 7 at Northern Westchester Hospital in . Mount Kisco, New York . ‘The nurses are not on trial,’ she said. She said Kennedy ‘resorted to violence instead of simply complying with a request.’ ‘He would not be denied despite the safety and best interests of his child,’ she said. Kennedy's wife, Molly, and other relatives have been accompanying Kennedy to the trial. A state investigation launched after . Kennedy's arrest in February, including a visit to the Kennedy home in . Chappaqua, found no evidence of child abuse. Kennedy, 45, is the 10th of 11 . children of Robert and Ethel Kennedy. His father was assassinated in . 1968. President John F. Kennedy, his uncle, was assassinated in 1963. Kennedy was cleared of the child abuse charges in April - but still faces assault charges for his altercation with the nurses. Many kids: Douglas, who would not be born until a number of years after this photo, was only one when his father was shot . Siblings: Robert Kennedy was shot dead in 1968, and he is seen here with 7 of his 11 children in 1964, right . At the time, Kennedy gave his father’s assassination as the reason why he snatched his baby from the maternity ward. Douglas . Kennedy, 44, said that being haunted by the death of his father meant . he could not stop himself from grabbing his newborn son in breach of . hospital rules. When staff tried to stop him he said he was merely protecting the infant from 'strangers.’ It has been a difficult year for the . Kennedys in New York's suburbs.

Stunned Christine Gove, 73, branded her son a ‘monkey’ but insisted she had no idea about his naughty antics. When she finally manages to get through to the busy minister she is threatening a ‘good telling off’ - but he never answers his phone.

This week Mr Gove wrote an open letter to his former French teacher for ‘clever-dick questions’ and indulging in ‘pathetic showing off’. Writing to Danny Montgomery, who taught him French at Robert Gordon’s College in Aberdeen, he said: ‘It may be too late to say I’m sorry. Thirty years is too late. ‘But since apologies from politicians are considered as rare as away wins for Queens Park Rangers, I hope you will accept mine. ‘You were trying, patiently, . doggedly, good humouredly, to broaden our horizons.

Mrs Gove, who still lives in Aberdeen with husband Ernest, 76, said: ‘If I could see Michael now I’d give him a clip round the lug. ‘He would have been strung up if I had known he was being so cheeky. ‘At the time he never said anything about his attitude and when I heard about it on the radio, I thought “what a monkey”. ‘He would sometimes get a bit riled at that age, but I never thought he was a problem like that at school. ‘I can never get in touch with him these days - it just goes through to his answering machine - but when I do eventually speak to him, I’ll give him a good telling off.’ Mr Montgomery recalled once hearing a colleague declare: ‘That boy is a future leader of the Conservative Party.’ He added: ‘This raised a few eyebrows in the staffroom but also more than a few nods of agreement from one or two of my more experienced colleagues. 'He was already known for his sharp wit, strongly held beliefs backed by apparently limitless general knowledge and keen debating skills, which resulted in the downfall of many opponents.’","The Education Secretary wrote an open letter to his old French teacher apologising for 'clever-dick' questions and 'showing off'

When mobile phone handsfree kits first emerged, many were surprised to see people walking around or riding public transport apparently talking to themselves. Well, it could be time to once again reassess the standards according to which we judge normal behaviour. A new glove lets you write messages on your phone by simply wagging your fingers. It means social networking addicts can now send tweets, texts and Facebook messages without having to touch a screen or keyboard. Catching up with science fiction: Jiake Liu shows off the keyboard glove, left, the concept of which is similar to the gloves used by Tom Cruise's character in Minority Report as he trawls through a computer database . The new technology is similar to that . imagined in the 2002 science fiction film Minority Report, in which . John Anderton - played by Tom Cruise - uses a pair of gloves to interact . with a computer database. With the keyboard glove, instead of tapping keys, the user . simply uses their thumb to touch points on their fingers or palm, which . are assigned a letter of the alphabet. Other areas include keyboard . functions, such as 'space' and 'enter'. A Danish company hopes to clinch deals with major mobile phone and tablet makers after developing software that enables users to control their devices by moving their eyes. 'You can use it for basic control, such as turning to the next page in an e-book, and playing games with your eyes,' chief executive and co-founder of The Eye Tribe, Sune Alstrup Johansen, said. The software uses infrared light reflected from the pupil of the eye, which is recorded by the device's camera, enabling users to scroll or click on their screens with their eyes. When you are reading an e-book and get to the bottom of the page, the software will know to turn to the next page, or if you look away from the screen it will dim it. The Eye Tribe is made up of four PhD students who founded the company a year ago. They received $800,000 (615,000 euros) in funding in August to develop the technology. The company plans to release the technology at no cost to other software developers early next year. Thin wires carry the 'keystrokes' to a . matchbox-sized control unit on the back of the glove, which transmits . the commands via Bluetooth. The Gauntlet Keyboard works with computers, mobile phones, games consoles, music synthesisers and even military equipment. It was designed by four computer engineers at the The University of Alabama in Huntsville, Alabama. Inventor . Jiake Liu said the inspiration came from his interest in science . fiction movies and experience with touch-screen technologies. 'Think of the Gauntlet as a touch screen that works by tapping your fingers to your thumb on a gloved hand,' he said. 'It could be used as a keyboard for . the consumer market or the medical field for people limited to one hand . due to a disability.' Once Mr Liu and his partners came up with the idea, they researched the most frequently used characters on a keyboard. Common . keystrokes got the easiest finger-thumb alignments like the fingertips. Less common ones required more hand contortions to make the contacts. You can even delete words while wearing the glove by performing a swiping gesture with your hand. The keyboard characters are sewn into the finger and palm positions to make it easier to learn. These letters can be removed once the positions have been memorised, making it look more like a traditional, plain black glove. The Gauntlet in action: Instead of tapping keys, the user simply uses their thumb to touch points on their fingers or palm, which are assigned a letter of the alphabet. Other areas include keyboard functions, such as 'space' and 'enter' Stephen Doud, who is also working on the project, said: 'We tried to figure the easiest places to touch your finger with your thumb. 'We then put the most commonly used letters there to make the glove as efficient and easy to use as possible.' The developers are now seeking a patent and hope to see the glove on shop shelves soon.","Gauntlet keyboard allows users to write messages by touching points on their palms and fingers .

Love it or hate it, cow's milk is an excellent source of calcium and vitamin D. Now scientists think they can harness it to protect people from HIV. Researchers found that cows could be used to produce antibodies that defend against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The animals can't contract the disease themselves. The next step will be to develop it into . a cream which women can apply to protect themselves from contracting . HIV from sexual partners. A team from Melbourne University  worked with Australian biotechnology company Immuron Ltd to develop the milk. The . scientists, led by Dr Marti Kramski, vaccinated pregnant cows with an . HIV protein and studied the first milk that cows produced after giving . birth. The first milk, . called the colostrum, is naturally packed with antibodies to protect the . newborn calf from infections. The vaccinated cows produced HIV . antibodies in their milk. 'We were able to harvest antibodies specific to the HIV surface protein from the milk,' said Dr Kramski. 'We have tested these antibodies and found in our laboratory experiments that they bind to HIV and that this inhibits the virus from infecting and entering human cells.' The HIV-inhibiting antibodies from cows’ milk will be developed into a cream called a microbicide that is applied into the vagina before and/or after sex to protect women from contracting sexually transmitted infections. Other microbicides are being developed . around the world but the antibodies in this research are easier and . cheaper to produce, providing a new HIV-prevention strategy. 'We hope that our anti-HIV milk . antibodies will provide a user-friendly, female-controlled, safe and . effective tool for the prevention of sexually acquired HIV infection,' Dr Kramski said.

Terrified airline staff were forced to call animal rescuers after finding a massive snake on a plane. The 18inch long reptile was spotted under a seat on a flight which had arrived from Cancun in Mexico. The juvenile Middle American smooth-scaled racer was found on the plane at Glasgow Airport on Tuesday, echoing 2006 film Snakes on a Plane. Stowaway: Furtivo, believed to be a juvenile Middle American smooth-scaled racer, was found on the plane at Glasgow Airport . It is unclear if the reptile slithered onto the plane itself or if it escaped from someone’s hand luggage. Staff from the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals were called and used a box to contain the snake. The snake was taken to the charity’s animal rescue centre in Cardonald, Glasgow, where staff have named it Furtivo - Spanish for sneak. SPCA senior inspector Billy Linton said: 'We have had the snake examined by a vet and, although we can’t be 100 per cent certain, we believe he is of the Dryadophis family, which are commonly referred to as American smooth-scaled racers. 'Racers aren’t venomous but, like all snakes, they can bite and Furtivo is very feisty. Although small at the moment, he is still a juvenile and has a lot of growing to do.' Venomous: A still from 'Snakes on a Plane', featuring Samuel L. Jackson (left). The film centered on an outbreak of poisonous reptiles on a flight, with lethal consequences (right) Inspector Linton said staff at Glasgow Airport had 'remained remarkably calm' after finding the snake. He said: 'I can only imagine that Furtivo managed to sneak his way onto the plane while it was waiting to take off in Cancun, although it is also possible he has hitched a lift in someone’s hand luggage. 'We have rescued several exotic creatures from international flights including scorpions, spiders, turtles and even giant land snails, so this isn’t as unusual as many people might think. 'Furtivo will remain in our care until we can find him an expert home with someone who has the necessary experience and knowledge to be able to look after such a creature.' The discovery of Furtivo brings to mind the 2006 action movie Snakes on a Plane, in which an FBI Agent, played by Samuel L. Jackson, has to contend with a plane full of venomous snakes. The film's B movie-esque title generated a lot of pre-release interest on the internet and fans had a lot of say in the movie's overall direction. In an interview with New York Times Magazine, Jackson said he heard about the movie he called the director, David R. Ellis, and said, 'You doing a movie about snakes on a plane?' 'Yeah'. 'A plane full of poisonous snakes?' 'Yeah'. 'I’m down.' At one point, the film was given the title Pacific Air Flight 121, only to have it changed back to the working title at Samuel L. Jackson's request. In August 2005, the actor told an interviewer, 'We're totally changing that back. That's the only reason I took the job: I read the title.'","18inch reptile found under a seat on a flight from Mexico .

NFL great Lawrence Taylor, reliving a night to forget, admitted yesterday that he paid for sex with a 'very, very pretty' prostitute in 2010 but denied accusations that he ignored obvious signs she was a teen runaway in distress. Taylor, 53, told a Manhattan jury at a civil trial that he had a history of hiring women for 'company' when on the road but didn't expect them to automatically have sex with him. 'I still like the chase,' Taylor testified. But he added, 'I like to stack the odds in my favor... I don't like to work too hard.' Accuser: Cristina Fierro, right, said she didn't . know who Taylor was when she went to his hotel room and found him naked . in bed in the 2010 incident . The former New York Giants linebacker was arrested in 2010 after having sex with the then-16-year-old girl in a hotel room in Montebello, just north of New York City. He's serving six months of probation after pleading guilty last year to misdemeanor charges of sexual misconduct and patronizing an underage prostitute. His accuser, Cristina Fierro, claims that an abusive pimp forced her to have sex with Taylor for $300. She sued Taylor in federal court in Manhattan, claiming he should be held accountable. The Brooklyn-born Fierro, 19, wept while testifying on Wednesday that a hulking Taylor refused to stop having sex with her, even after she told him it hurt and tried to push him away. Trial: Former New York Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor is pictured as he leaves federal court on Tuesday after hearing testimony from his accuser . NFL icon: Taylor played for 13 seasons in the NFL and has two Super Bowl rings that he won with the New York Giants . 'I kept telling him I didn't want to be there,' she said. 'He's much bigger than me. I couldn't do anything.' The day before, she testified that she told him it was her 'first time' and he replied, 'Just relax.' 'It . was really rough and painful,' she testified, saying she felt suicidal . several months later and began taking medication for depression, . insomnia and anxiety. Fierro . testified that when the sex was over Taylor 'just pulled out money and . said, ""Here, can you turn the TV off on your way out?""' Fall from grace: Taylor, who is considered to be . one of the greatest linebackers in the history of the NFL, was charged . with rape in May 2010 . Taylor, in his testimony, painted a much different picture, saying he was respectful to Fierro after a friend arranged for her to go to his room after midnight in the spring of 2010. During 'chit chat,' she told him she was 19 years old and Dominican, he said. 'I thought she was very, very pretty,' he said. 'I thought she was a cute girl... I thought she was very sexy.' He testified that he tried to perform oral sex on her but stopped when she resisted 'because a lot of island girls don't like that.' Accused: Taylor, pictured with attorney Arthur Aidala shortly after his arrest in May 2010, was charged with sexual misconduct and prostitution charges . But after that, 'She didn't seem to have a problem,' he said. 'She didn't tell me to stop.' Taylor's lawyer has called Fierro's lawsuit, seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, 'a money grab' because of Taylor's fame. Taylor, who lives in Broward County, Florida, led the Giants to Super Bowl titles in 1987 and 1991. He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the NFL's 75th Anniversary All-Time Team.

One of nine engines on the SpaceX company's Falcon 9 rocket failed on Sunday - 79 seconds after launch due to a loss in pressure. The engine didn't explode, but it did start a series of events that meant another company's private satellite is not in the place it is needed. Scroll down for video . Going as planned? The SpaceX rocket launch appeared to be going as planned more than a minute after the launch . Flash: One of nine engines on the SpaceX company's Falcon 9 rocket failed on Sunday - 79 seconds after launch due to a loss in pressure . The main mission for the Falcon launch - delivering half a ton of science and food supplies toward the space station - is still on track with a docking of the cargo-laden Dragon capsule scheduled for Wednesday. SpaceX on Monday said the ship's flight computer calculated a new path to the station for the capsule. It is the first of a dozen supply runs under a mega-contract with NASA. 'Falcon 9 did exactly what it was designed to do,' the California based SpaceX said. 'Like the Saturn V, which experienced engine loss on two flights, Falcon 9 is designed to handle an engine out situation and still complete its mission.' But not all of its mission. Problem: The engine didn't explode, but it did start a series of events that meant Orbcomm's private satellite, sending it into a lower orbit than what was intended . Set for the stars: The SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon capsule taking off from the Cape Canaveral, Florida . The original plan was for Falcon to fire its second stage engines after Dragon left and then deploy an industrial communications satellite into orbit for Orbcomm of Dulles, Virginia. Because this is a new resupply ship for the space station, NASA and its international partners had set detailed safety rules in advance for Falcon, even though the engine failure was far from the station. And those rules prevent SpaceX from firing its second stage engines, Orbcomm said in a statement. The satellite is in a lower orbit and engineers are trying to figure out how to boost it, Orbcomm said. Up and away: The Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon capsule lift off from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station launch complex . On its way: The rocket is flying in pursuit of the International Space Station . This was the first of 18 satellites that Orbcomm had hired SpaceX to deliver. The satellites help in two-way communications for companies to track their heavy equipment across the world. The company wouldn't respond to questions about the cost of the satellite or launch services. Harvard University astronomer Jonathan McDowell, who tracks launches worldwide, noticed the problem for hours before either company acknowledged that the satellite was in the wrong orbit. Even though SpaceX was congratulating itself after the launch, McDowell said: 'We can't say that it was a perfect launch.' Lit up: The SpaceX Falcon illuminated the sky as it made its ascent . A 71-second exposure of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket successfully launching - as seen from Port Canaveral . The commercial cargo ship rocketed into orbit on Sunday, the first of a dozen supply runs to the space station under a mega-contract with NASA. It was the second launch of a Dragon capsule to the orbiting lab by the California-based SpaceX company. The first was last spring. This time was no test flight, however, and the spacecraft carried 1,000 pounds of key science experiments and other precious gear. There was also a personal touch: chocolate-vanilla swirl ice cream tucked in a freezer for the three station residents. SpaceX employees watch the Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon capsule launch on Sunday evening . The Falcon 9 rocket is bringing cargo to the International Space Station including equipment, science experiment and ice cream . NASA is counting on private business . to restock the space station, now that the shuttles have retired to . museums. The space agency has a $1.6billion contract with SpaceX for 12 . resupply missions. Especially exciting for NASA is the . fact that the Dragon will return twice as much cargo as it took up, . including a stockpile of astronauts' blood and urine samples. The . samples - nearly 500 of them - have been stashed in freezers since . Atlantis made the last shuttle flight in July 2011. 'While it may seem very strange to some . folks, my typical line is that, ""It may be urine to you, but it's gold . to us,""' said NASA nutritionist Scott Smith. 'There's a lot of science that comes out of this.' The . Dragon will spend close to three weeks at the space station before . being released and parachuting into the Pacific at the end of October. By then, the space station should be back up to a full crew of six. None . of the Russian, European or Japanese cargo ships can bring anything . back; they're destroyed during re-entry. The Russian Soyuz crew capsules . have limited room for anything besides people. All together: The private launch is hoped to be the first of more to come at Cape Canaveral with SpaceX photographing a sign of encouragement to their team on Saturday . Space Exploration Technologies Corp., . or SpaceX - owned by PayPal co-founder Elon Musk - is working to . convert its unmanned Dragon capsules into vessels that could carry . astronauts to the space station in three years. Other . U.S. companies also are vying to carry crews. Americans must ride . Russian rockets to orbit in the meantime, for a steep price. NASA's space station program manager, . Mike Suffredini, is thrilled about having an American spacecraft . bearing goods. It's much easier to get last-minute equipment aboard a . U.S. capsule, he noted. The Dragon, for example, will carry up a new . pump for the space station's urine-into-drinking water recycling system. A 30 second camera exposure shows SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket attached to the cargo-only capsule called Dragon as it lifts off . The unmanned Falcon rocket roared into the night sky on Sunday evening, putting SpaceX on track to reach the space station Wednesday . 'Shipping and customs can kill you when you're trying to get overseas,' Suffredini said. Musk, . who monitored the launch from SpaceX Mission Control in Hawthorne, . California, called the capsules Dragon after the magical Puff to get . back at critics who, a decade ago, considered his effort a fantasy. The . name Falcon comes from the Millennium Falcon starship of Star Wars . fame. An . estimated 2,400 guests jammed the launching center to see the Falcon, . with its Dragon, come to life for SpaceX's first official, operational . supply mission. 'Just over a year since shuttle . retirement, to be able to do that is, I think, what people are very . excited about,' said NASA's deputy administrator, Lori Garver. People watch as the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket attached to the cargo-only capsule called Dragon is raised into launch position . Across the country at SpaceX headquarters, about 1,000 employees watched via TV and webcast. SpaceX is shooting for its next supply run in January. Another . company looking to haul space station cargo, Virginia's Orbital . Sciences Corp., hopes to launch a solo test flight in December and a . demo mission to the station early next year. NASA, . meanwhile, expects to name within a few weeks the U.S. astronaut and . Russian cosmonaut who will spend an entire year aboard the space . station, beginning in spring 2015, twice the usual length for a mission. Suffredini said the list of potential candidates is 'very short.' Another .

Microsoft could face a multibillion-dollar fine after being charged with breaking EU competition rules. The US software giant has been accused of failing to fulfill a pledge made three years ago to allow users of its flagship Windows software equal access to rival web browsers. Microsoft had agreed to the condition in order to settle an EU investigation - and avoid a fine of up to 10 percent of its annual turnover. Dispute: Microsoft faces a hefty fine after being charged by the European Commission with breaking a promise to give users of its Windows software equal access to rival web browsers (Pictured: the firm's chairman, Bill Gates) But . the European Commission, which acts as competition watchdog in the EU, said the firm had failed to fulfill this agreement between February 2011 and . July this year. The decision by Joaquín Almunia, the European Union's antitrust commissioner, opens the firm up to a substantial fine for defying the terms of the settlement - reached in 2009. Mr Almunia warned that when a company enters into commitments - 'they must do what they are committed to do or face the consequences.' 'Companies should be deterred from any temptation to renege on promises or even to neglect their duty,' he told a news briefing. He said he had also warned Microsoft about access to rival browsers on Windows 8, the latest version of the company's flagship product which will be released on Friday. 'We have been in contact with them regarding Windows 8. I have precisely transmitted ... what are my concerns, what kind of presentation should be avoided if they don't want to take the risk of a new investigation,' he said. Warning: The firm has also been warned to provide access to rival web browsers via its new Windows 8 software - which will be released on Friday . A sanction could top $7.4 billion or 10 percent of its revenues for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2012 - but the final figure is expected to be lower, as the infringement covered a relatively short period of time. Microsoft, which has been penalised 1.36 billion euros ($1.76 billion) in the last decade for infringing EU rules, apologised. It has four weeks to reply to the Commission's 'statement of objections.' 'Although this was the result of a technical error, we take responsibility for what happened, and we are strengthening our internal procedures to help ensure something like this cannot happen again,' the company said in a statement. Mr Almunia told the briefing he had no reason to go after Microsoft's operating system for tablets, a market that includes rivals Apple and Google. 'We have looked at Windows RT and, on the basis of our investigation so far, there are no grounds to pursue further investigation on this particular issue,' he said. The Commission said in July that several companies had accused Microsoft of only allowing its own Internet Explorer browser to be installed on devices running Windows 8 on Windows RT tablets. With the Microsoft case heading for resolution, the next battle for the Commission is likely to be with Google, the target of complaints by Microsoft and more than a dozen other rivals over its core search engine business. The world's most popular search engine is now in talks with the EU watchdog that could help it avoid sanctions which could amount to some $4 billion.","European Commission claims firm reneged on pledge to offer equal access to rival web browsers via its flagship Windows software .

U.S. Senator George McGovern, 90, is 'coming to the end of his life' McGovern died Sunday at the age of 90 after a brief stay in hospice care. Friends and colleagues remembered McGovern as an early critic of the Vietnam War, a . tireless advocate to combat poverty, and a . man who's legacy will continue to inspire young people into a life of public service. Mourners: Former U.S. Vice President Walter Mondale, far left, Sen. Tim Johnson, left of center, and, Sen. John Kerry, right of center, and Sen. John Thune, far right, gathered to remember McGovern . Hart called McGovern a man who could rise . above the rhetoric of politics, particularly when his opponents tried to . use the term 'liberal' as an insult to malign him as a supposedly . weak-willed candidate. 'He was larger than any political label, . particularly a demonized one,' Hart said.

Admirer: Speaking at a memorial service for McGovern Thursday, Vice President Joe Biden praised as the 'father of the modern Democrat Party' Nixon's victory was among the most decisive in the history of U.S. elections as he took every state, even McGovern's South Dakota home, with the exception of Massachusetts. However McGovern's campaign is credited as the spark that ignited the stars of today's Democratic Party, especially two of his former campaign workers: now secretary-of-state Hillary Clinton and former president Bill Clinton. The night before his funeral, Vice President Joe Biden spoke at a memorial service for McGovern calling him the 'father of the modern Democratic Party' for his ferocious opposition to the Vietnam War as well as helping to open the party to women, young people, and minorities.

He told the Evening Standard: 'It was just a lucky fish. I was after whiting.' The retired insurance broker will eat the fish with his wife Shirley. Other fish caught at Saturday's event were two pouting, three dab, 24 flounder and 520 whiting.

"By . Associated Press and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 12:06 EST, 19 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:06 EST, 19 September 2012 . A North Carolina sheriff and his deputies routinely discriminated against Hispanics - a group he referred to as 'taco eaters' - by making unwarranted arrests with the goal of ramping up deportations, according to a two-year probe by the U.S. Department of Justice. In an 11-page report issued Tuesday, the federal agency said Alamance County Sheriff Terry S. Johnson and his deputies violated the constitutional rights of U.S. citizens and legal residents by illegally targeting, stopping, detaining and arresting Latinos without probable cause. The agency also said that Johnson obstructed the federal investigation launched in 2010 by withholding requested documents and falsifying records. Discrimination: Sheriff Terry Johnson of Alamance County, North Carolina, has been accused of rampant discrimination against Latinos in his jurisdiction, and calling them 'taco eaters' Federal investigators said members of the department also feared retaliation if they cooperated with them. The report outlined a list of steps to end discrimination by the department, including remedial training, new internal procedures for recognising and investigating civil rights violations and community outreach. If the county fails to reach a negotiated settlement, the Justice Department could take the county to federal court. Charges: Johnson's department is accused of illegally targeting, stopping, detaining and arresting Latinos without probable cause . Justice Department officials didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on whether their probe could result in criminal charges. A Republican who was first elected in 2002, Johnson suggested the probe was a political, and cast blame on the White House. Sheriff Johnson said on Tuesday: 'We have never discriminated against Spanish-speaking persons in any way, shape or form. The Obama administration has decided to continue to wage war on local law enforcement.' According to the federal report, Johnson referred to Latinos as 'taco eaters' prone to drinking, drug dealing and other crimes. He ordered special roadblocks in neighborhoods were Latinos live, during which those with brown skin were stopped while whites were waved through. Johnson also ordered his deputies to arrest motorists who appeared Latino - even for minor traffic infractions - while letting white drivers off with warnings, according to the report. His deputies, in turn, were as much as 10 times more likely to stop Latino drivers than non-Latinos, according the federal review of the department's traffic stop records. Hispanics make up only 11 per cent of the county's population. Alamance County lies about an hour's drive northwest of Raleigh and has around 150,000 residents, according to U.S. Census figures. 'If you stop a Mexican, don't write a citation, arrest him,' the sheriff is quoted as telling supervisors within his department, according to the report. Denial: Johnson, left, says the DOJ probe is political, and blames the Obama administration . In public statements, the sheriff credited his crackdown with decreasing the population of Latinos. 'Their values are a lot different - their morals - than what we have here,' Johnson was quoted as saying in a 2007 newspaper article cited in the federal report. 'In Mexico, there's nothing wrong with having sex with a 12- or 13-year-old girl.' A spokesman for the sheriff, Randy Jones, denied the sheriff had ever used the term 'taco eaters.' He conceded the 2007 quote was accurate, but said it was made in the context of a local prostitution bust involving underage girls. Johnson was a vocal proponent of the federal 287(g) program initiated during President George W. Bush's administration that allowed local law enforcement officials to check the immigration status of those placed under arrest. Behind the report: Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez, signed the DOJ probe, which alleges discrimination in Alamance County . Following widespread complaints of racial profiling, the Department of Homeland Security announced earlier this this year it was discontinuing the program to instead focus on deporting illegal immigrants arrested for serious crimes. Tuesday's report, signed by Assistant Attorney General Thomas E. Perez, outlines numerous statements and incidents that Perez says show prejudice against Latinos. 'The discriminatory conduct we observed is deeply rooted in a culture that begins with Sheriff Johnson and permeates the entire agency,' said Perez, who oversees the agency's civil rights division. 'While Sheriff Johnson often justifies (his department's) activities by citing his desire to combat illegal immigration, we conclude that anti-Latino bias motivates his selection and enforcement of enforcement priorities.' Justice officials say Johnson tried to stonewall their probe, ordering his staff to speak with federal investigators only with his department's lawyer present. The federal agency filed a complaint in U.S. District Court last year seeking to compel interviews without the sheriff's lawyer present, saying staff members had expressed concern Johnson or others would retaliate against them if they talked. That complaint was dismissed at the government's request Tuesday as the Justice Department issued its findings, making the issue moot. Johnson said Tuesday he and his staff had 'cooperated fully' with the Justice Department, providing tens of thousands of pages of documents. Ultimatum: If Alamance County fails to reach a settlement on how to end discrimination outlined in Perez's report, the DOJ, led by Attorney General Eric Holder, right, could take the county to federal court . 'The only thing we have refused to do is to deprive our deputies of their constitutional right to have an attorney present during interrogation by the DOJ,' Johnson said. A 2012 study by a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill suggested racial profiling is a statewide problem. Focus: The report charges that the discrimination alleged in Alamance County is rooted with Johnson, whose four-year term expires in 2014 . Analyzing data recorded from more than 13 million traffic stops by North Carolina law enforcement officers between 2000 and 2011, the study reported that Latinos are 96 per cent more likely than whites to have their vehicles searched during a traffic stop, while blacks are 77 per cent more likely to be searched than whites. The federal investigation found Johnson's deputies attempted to hide how many Latinos they were stopping and arresting by 'vastly underreporting' under a state law requiring records to be kept of all traffic stops and misclassifying many Latinos booked into the county jail as black. The North Carolina chapter of the Americans of American Civil Liberties Union issued a public plea Tuesday that motorists around the state come forward if they believe they are the victims of racial profiling. 'We have been receiving troubling reports of discriminatory policing by the Alamance County Sheriff's Office for years,' said Chris Brook, the legal director of the ACLU of North Carolina. 'The findings released today confirm our fear that such discriminatory tactics are a systemic problem. We call on Alamance County to work with the Department of Justice to promptly adopt comprehensive policies addressing the pervasive pattern and culture of unconstitutional discrimination.' Perez suggested the actions of Johnson and his deputies were not only illegal, but impeded the ability of the Alamance officers to solve serious crimes by sowing distrust within the community and making Latinos scared to call law enforcement. The sheriff's current 4-year term expires in 2014. 'Constitutional policing and effective law enforcement go hand-in-hand,' Perez said in the report. 'Biased policing makes the job of police officers harder, not easier.'","Department of Justice report finds rampant discrimination against Latinos in Alamance County, North Carolina .

Convicted murderer and Kennedy cousin Michael Skakel has been denied parole, a decade after being given a life sentence for beating his teenage neighbor to death with a golf club. Skakel's request was rejected following a two-hour hearing on Wednesday in which he proclaimed his innocence. The chair of the parole board at the Connecticut prison, Erika . Tindill, said it was odd for Skakel to ask for early release while . proclaiming he is innocent. Freedom bid: Convicted murderer Michael Skakel has appealed for his release today in Connecticut but failed . The victim's mother, Dorothy Moxley, said during the hearing in Suffield that Skakel should serve at least 20 years. Skakel told the board that it 'is not an easy question to answer' as to whether he should be paroled, according to the Hartford Courant. He added that he knew the best chance of being paroled was for him to admit to the crime. Robert F. Kennedy Jr had appealed for . his cousin's release, saying in a letter that Skakel is a model inmate . and devoted to God. Skakel has submitted 65 letters in support of his . release. Skakel, 52, spoke slowly and softly . during the hearing at McDougall-Walker Correctional Institution in . Suffield, Connecticut saying: 'I did not commit this crime.' Other . Kennedys have rallied around their relative, claiming that his trial . was a miscarriage of justice. However relatives of 15-year-old murder . victim Martha Moxley say Skakel has shown no remorse and should remain . in prison for the rest of his life. Long walk back: Despite the parole hearing, Skakel was returned to his prison cell today to continue serving his life sentence . Skakel said on Wednesday that he prays every day that whoever committed the crime is brought to justice, but he is the wrong man. 'If I could ease Mrs. Moxley's pain in any way, shape or form I would take responsibility all day long for this crime,' Skakel said. He added: 'I cannot bear false witness against myself.' The heavyset, 52-year-old Skakel with gray, thinning hair wore a beige prison jumpsuit to the hearing. To support his claims of innocence, he told of how he became sober. 'I pose to you: how can a guilty man stay sober for 30 years with that kind of guilt on his mind?' he said. Skakel, convicted in 2002, is eligible for parole consideration because of laws in place at the time of the crime including good behavior credits. Supporter: Robert F Kennedy Jr has appealed for his cousin Michael Skakel's release . In letters to the parole board, Skakel's supporters, including his cousin Robert F. Kennedy Jr., said Skakel has helped alcoholics recover. They also portray him as religious and devoted to his son. Many letters cite Skakel's art work in prison, saying he has made uplifting paintings that show his true nature, give joy to others and encourage family values. Letters objecting to his parole cite the brutal nature of the crime and say releasing him early would be devastating to the victim's family. 'This person committed a heinous crime that gave many people a sentence of suffering that was irreversible,' one of the letters states. 'Why then should this person be given relief, when none is available for those who suffered the loss of a daughter, a sister, a dear friend.' On Tuesday, Skakel filed a defamation lawsuit against CNN television host Nancy Grace and Tru-TV host Beth Karas, alleging they made false statements about evidence of Skakel's DNA near the crime scene. The lawsuit, filed in Superior Court in Stamford, also named media companies Time Warner and Turner Broadcasting as defendants. Skakel . was sentenced to 20 years to life for beating Martha Moxley to death . with a golf club in 1975 in Greenwich when they were 15-year-old . neighbors. Skakel is a nephew of Robert F. Kennedy's widow, Ethel . Kennedy. Martha Moxley was just 15-years-old when she was brutally murdered close to her home in Connecticut . 'There's never been a person more deserving of parole than Michael Skakel,' his attorney, Hope Seeley, said in a statement. Michael Skakel was only 15 at the time his 15-year-old neighbor Martha Moxley was beaten to death with a golf club in 1975. Skakel was arrested 25 years later in 2000. He was finally indicted for murder afer a 1998 book written about the events of that night suggested Michael had been at the scene. He had said he was at his cousin's house at the time of the murder. However, Michael later admitted that he had been masturbating in the tree house on the night before the victim's remains were found in the same spot. Two former students of Elan, a boarding . school where Skakel had been sent for alcohol addiction treatment in his late teens, also . testified that Skakel had confessed to Miss Moxley's murder. Other reports suggested that Skakel was jealous of his brother, Thomas's relationship with Miss Moxley. Thomas had long been considered a murder suspect. According to former neighbor Gregory Coleman, Michael Skakel had bragged: 'I'm going to get away with murder. I'm a Kennedy.' Michael Skakel is the nephew of Robert F. Kennedy's widow, Ethel . Kennedy. On June 6, 1968, Senator Kennedy was assassinated by a shooter in LA following his victory in the Californian presidential primary. David Kennedy, his son, died of a Demerol and cocaine overdose in a Florida hotel room in 1984, having battled addiction for many years. Michael Kennedy, another son of RFK, died during a skiing accident in Aspen when some family members were playing football while on skis and not wearing helmets. He crashed into a tree during the December 1997 incident and died. It happened shortly after his family's babysitter claimed he had a sexual relationship with her when she was 14. 'His track record during the past 10 . years shows the person we all know him to be - caring, generous and . committed to his faith, family and friends. 'His . conviction was a miscarriage of justice, but that aside, his further . incarceration would also be a miscarriage of justice in light of the . fact that he should have been sentenced as a juvenile.' Skakel has lost appeals challenging his conviction that raised the juvenile issue and other claims. He . last appeared in court in January 2011, asking for his sentence to be . shortened. A three-judge panel rejected the request, saying it was . 'unjust and excessive'. At . the appearance, Skakel continued to maintain his innocence, telling the . court: 'I didn't commit this crime... give me a polygraph. I pray for . Mrs Moxley every single day.' Martha Moxley's mother, Dorthy, and . brother, John, want him kept in prison for life. Skakel has shown no . remorse, John Moxley said. 'Michael . Skakel is representative of the most dangerous aspect of our society in . that he was raised in an environment in which he was exposed to and at . some point embraced the mindset that the rules of our general society . did not then and do not now apply to him,' Moxley wrote in a letter to . the parole board. 'And, . I believe that Michael Skakel's inbred sense of self and his . self-confessed quick temper will always represent a threat to society.' He said the murder continues to haunt him. 'No . child should ever have to witness the pain I have seen my parents go . through, which I know in my heart contributed to my father's early . death,' Mr Moxley wrote.

"By . Jack Doyle and James Slack . PUBLISHED: . 21:02 EST, 28 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 21:02 EST, 28 October 2012 . Long overdue: The new review launched into prison privileges will be the first in 13 years . Outrageous prisoner perks look likely to be axed in a shake-up of cushy jail rules. A full review – the first for more than a decade – will examine the lax regimes which allow inmates to lounge in their cells all day, watching daytime TV or playing video games. Prisons Minister Jeremy Wright told the Daily Mail he was worried too many inmates were routinely handed ‘privileges’ they should have to earn through good behaviour and hard work. He said: ‘I want to ensure that the public have confidence in the prison system. 'It is crucial that they are assured that any privileges earned in prison are gained through hard work and appropriate behaviour.’ ‘I am looking closely at the policy around the incentives scheme for prisoners, which has not been fully reviewed since 1999. ‘There may be clear and important operational reasons for this policy but I want to be clear that these incentives are pitched at the right level and that they have credibility with the public.’ Currently, prisoners enter jail on a ‘standard’ regime, which automatically gives them certain entitlements, including in-cell television. They are only bumped down to the basic regime if they step out of line.Each prison devises its own scheme for how privileges are handed out. Inmates can ‘earn’ entitlements to in-cell television, more visits, higher pay when they work, the right to wear their own clothes and access to their own money. Inmates are offered a string of digital channels, including BBC1, BBC2, ITV1, Channel 4, Channel 5, ITV3, Viva – a music channel – and Film 4. Prisons that are run by private companies, of which there are 11 in England and Wales, may provide Sky TV in prisoners’ cells. Some 4,000 convicts are understood to enjoy the perk. Privileged prisoners: Inmates at HMP Haverigg in Cumbria posted this shirtless picture on Facebook in June, shamelessly defying a ban on phones in prison . One option under consideration would be to start inmates on basic and force them to work for extra perks. Place of punishment: Brooke Kinsella wants to make prisons tough again . The move marks a break from Mr Wright’s . disastrous predecessor Crispin Blunt who was pilloried over his decision . to allow taxpayer-funded prisoner parties and comedy workshops inside . jails. There have been complaints that prisons have become too soft and young criminals treat them like a ‘holiday camp’. Brooke Kinsella, the Government’s knife-crime adviser whose 16-year-old brother Ben was stabbed to death in North London, said it was time jails were turned back into ‘places of punishment’. Edward Boyd, from the think-tank Policy Exchange, says that perks such as free gym use and televisions in cells should be made available only to those inmates who work. He called for all prisoners to be given access to work and for those who refused to have their privileges downgraded or removed. Mr Boyd said: ‘Prisons are in desperate need of reform. The cornerstone of reform must be hard work. ‘It will make prison not only a better deterrent for criminals but also a far more successful intervention to stop future criminal behaviour.’ Recently a watchdog warned that too many prisoners were idling in their cells watching daytime TV, while prison workshops were left empty. Chief inspector of prisons Nick Hardwick said that on a visit to Britain’s largest jail, Wandsworth prison in south west London, workshop facilities ‘stood almost empty and too many staff appeared indifferent about the prisoners in their care’.","First review on regimes since 1999 will examine standards of prison life .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 13:04 EST, 8 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:21 EST, 9 May 2012 . An ex-policeman and former director of the Great Yorkshire Show was jailed for two-and-a-half years today after he admitted filming a man having sex with a pony. Charles Littleboy, 55, made the video in his stables while the man was supposedly taking part in an animal breeding practical course, Teesside Crown Court heard. Police discovered the video along with a stash of images of horrific sexual abuse of young boys on two computers at Littleboy’s home in Howe, Thirsk, North Yorkshire. Bestiality: Former policeman and ex-director of the Great Yorkshire Show, Charles Littleboy (pictured), has been jailed after admitting filming a man having sex with a pony . He pleaded guilty last month to 11 counts of making indecent images of children, four counts of distributing indecent images of children, five counts of possessing extreme pornographic images and one count of possessing 3,904 indecent photographs of children. Some of the extreme pornography related to bestiality - including the material he filmed consensually at his property, the court heard. Other images concerned sexual mutilation of men. The film with the male pony was made a number of years ago while the man stayed at his home, Shaun Dodds, prosecuting, said. Another film police found involved the same man having sex with a dog, the police said. Depraved: Littleboy, a former member of the British Potato Council, has been jailed for two-and-a-half years and put on the Sex Offenders' Register for life . Simon Reevell, defending, said Littleboy did not coerce the man to have sex with the pony. 'Although it is a difficult and unpleasant thought, there was a willingness on the part of both of them,” he said. Over six years until 2010, Littleboy downloaded images of child abuse from the internet and engaged in depraved discussions with fellow paedophiles, the court heard. In one conversation read out by the prosecution, Littleboy discussed sexually abusing a baby with a writer known as Pervy Dwain. Sick: The court heard Littleboy had discussed with other paedophiles about sexually abusing a baby . Littleboy had asked: 'Tell me what you would do to a young one and how sick you would like it to be.' The indecent images found on his computer included an image of a baby around three months old being abused. Other pictures involved boys aged as young as four, and clearly showed distress. One male child was gagged and bound, the court heard. Mr Reevell said his client was a shy and private man who now faced 'utter humiliation'. He passed a number of references up to Judge Peter Fox, the Recorder of Middlesbrough, saying: “They speak of a man wholly removed from these offences.' Mr Reevell said Littleboy cared for his parents, who are aged 84 and 79. Judge Fox accepted Littleboy’s reputation was ruined, but he added: 'What you fail at present to appreciate is the utter humiliation and degradation of the victims of your crimes, both human and animal.' He jailed Littleboy for two-and-a-half years, put him on the Sex Offenders’ Register for life and banned him from unsupervised contact with children. Littleboy is a former director of the Yorkshire Agricultural Society, which organises the Great Yorkshire Show, and an ex-member of the British Potato Council. He was also a police officer with North Yorkshire Police in the 1980s.","Charles Littleboy also had nearly 4,000 indecent images of children ."

A mother-of-two suffering from terminal cancer has revealed how her dying wishes are coming true thanks to the kindness of strangers. Melanie Swan Horton, 47, has fulfilled several lifetime ambitions - including learning to salsa, attending her first music festival, and skinny dipping - after friends posted her ‘bucket list’ on Facebook. ‘I wrote the bucket list to help me keep focused after being told I had just six months left,' she said. 'I never expected my friends to put it on Facebook but I’m so pleased they did. Making the most of life: Terminally ill Mel Swan Horton has fulfilled several lifetime ambitions including a champagne limousine ride (right) after friends posted her ‘bucket list’ on Facebook . Dreams becoming reality: Mel's friends created this Facebook page for her last month, and she has ticked off more than half of her list since it was published . 'The kindness and generosity of friends, acquaintances and complete strangers has restored my faith in the world. It really is incredible.' Mel, a former charity manager from Norwich, was given six months to live in July after a two-year battle with bowel cancer. She wrote a list of things she wanted to accomplish after doctors told her she had only a short time left. After joking about her ‘bucket list’ to friends, they promptly posted it on Facebook, appealing for help to make Mel’s dreams come true. And the incredible response the Facebook page has received means she has ticked off more than half of her list since it was published last month. ‘It shows what amazing family and friends I have and I am truly grateful to all the people who have read it and been moved enough to help,' she says. ‘Skinny dipping was a bit naughty but very funny. Luckily I ticked that off while fulfilling another wish to visit my parents in Cyprus so it was a bit warmer. A night she'll never forget: Mel's surprise champagne limousine ride was a dream come true. 'For a night I got to forget about the cancer and just had a brilliant time giggling with my daughters and friends,' she says. Doting mother: Mel with her twin daughters Leanne and Maria . ‘The music festival was brilliant. I needed a wheelchair because I couldn’t stand up all day but it was still great fun.’ She’s also been gifted theatre tickets, spa treatments and taken to several exclusive restaurants for meals out. However one of the highlights was a surprise champagne ride in a limousine organised by friends to coincide with her birthday. 'It was a dream come true. It’s something I’ve always wanted to do but never had the chance,' she says. 'For a night I got to forget about the cancer and just had a brilliant time giggling with my daughters and friends. ‘We felt like stars being driving around the city in the limo sipping bubbly and the driver was fantastic. I’m so grateful that putting the bucket list on Facebook has made it possible to create memories like this for my daughters.’ Mel, who is mother to 24-year-old twin girls Leanne and Maria, now hopes to reach the end of her list, but her health is deteriorating faster than expected. Dream holiday: Mel pictured on holiday with her daughters in Cyprus, a trip which was on her bucket list . ‘Recent blood tests have shown my liver is struggling but I’m determined to keep ticking things off my list,' she admits. ‘It’s helping me to keep strong and focused. I may have terminal cancer but I’m determined to keep living my life while I can. I might not have long left, but what I do have left I want to be fun. ‘These will be the last few weeks of my life and I want to live life to the maximum while I still can and really enjoy this time. ‘I have down days when I get very scared about dying, but then I get a message saying someone else has read the bucket list and wants to help and it makes me feel strong again.' Mel’s biggest wish is to continue to raise awareness of bowel cancer and save other lives, which she hopes will be achieved through telling her story. She was diagnosed in 2010 after noticing blood in the toilet after she used it. Mel had put earlier symptoms like weight loss and lethargy down to a new diet and exercise regime which had helped her drop from a size 16 to a size ten. Highlight: Mel is seen attending a music festival, which was one of the items on her 'bucket list' Showtime: Mel is seen attending a West End theatre show, another dream she had listed . ‘Ironically I felt fitter, happier and healthier than I had in years. I even wore a bikini for the first time,' she says. ‘I . put all the signs down to the exercise I was doing.

Of course if I hadn’t been . dieting and exercising I would have gone to the GP straight away.’ She began chemotherapy to shrink the tumour to an operable size soon after being diagnosed. But while she was on the operating table, doctors discovered the cancer had spread to her liver. Despite further treatment, more tumours were then found in her lungs and liver. ‘I was running out of options but I’ve always stayed positive and tried to fight it. I preferred not to ask the question about how long because I still hoped I could win,' she says. After beginning more chemotherapy this year, her doctor suggested that she consider stopping treatment altogether. ‘Basically the chemotherapy was making me very ill and my doctor suggested I stop,' she explains . 'They said there was nothing left to try. It was palliative care only. I was finally at the stage where I felt I needed to know how long I had. ‘When they said six months I knew it was time to start planning and started writing my bucket list. In a way it’s a privilege to be able to know and prepare and do wonderful things. 'I don’t have time to waste, especially as that was two months ago so I may only now have weeks. ‘Cancer has taken many things from me, but I won’t let it spoil these last few weeks of fun with my girls.’","Melanie Swan Horton, 47, visited family in Cyprus, went for a limo ride with friends... and learned to salsa .

Life-changing: Faye Sarr, 27, says Jimmy Savile repeatedly molested her when she worked as a waitress in a Leeds restaurant at 14 . A woman says she was repeatedly molested by Jimmy Savile in the fish and chip restaurant where she worked as a 14-year-old - a dreadful experience that inspired her to become a child protection officer. Faye Sarr, 27, is a now a social worker in Yorkshire and said she was 'groomed' by Savile, then in his 70s, who laughed as he groped her. As well as touching her all over her body, on one occasion the paedophile pushed her up against a wall and forced kisses on her. Ms Sarr broke her silence as the Metropolitan Police revealed there are at least 300 victims who were attacked by the DJ. Police also raided Savile’s secluded Scottish holiday home as they pursued more than 400 lines of inquiry. Ms Sarr said her abuse lasted six months while she worked at Marlows Fish and Chip Restaurant in Roundhay, where Savile lived in Leeds. She told how Savile dubbed her his 'private waitress' at the restaurant, one of his favourite haunts. 'He followed me into a back changing room where the waitresses took a break and pretended he had gone the wrong way,' she said. 'He said ""Oops, but while I’m in here,"" and pushed me up against the wall and tried to kiss me and was laughing at me. 'It was really awful as he found it so funny. I managed to turn my cheek to him nstead of my lips and wriggled out of his grip and ran away. I was very upset. Allegation: DJ Jimmy Savile at his house in Leeds - from where he would go for fish and chips at a local restaurant where Ms Sarr worked as a teenager . Difficult: Faye struggled for years to cope with what happened but is now a social worker in child protection as well as a married mother of one . 'He even asked me to go back to his flat. Everyone could hear and he said it like he was pretending, but he meant it. Hope: Faye says that she has explained what happened to encourage more people to come forward and speak to police like she has . 'I recall he said ""Do you want to come back to my place in Roundhay Park and be my private waitress? 'I never did, thankfully, but who knows what might have happened. Now I have heard about the rape allegations and other assaults, I know it could have been much worse. 'I feel angry now as I blamed myself. I did not realise I was being exploited. Everyone thought he was wonderful.' Now married and mother to a five-year-old girl, Faye was brought up in Roundhay  and enjoyed her work in the restaurant when predator Savile wasn’t visiting. She said: “It all happened during 1998-99 when I was still at school and worked part-time as a waitress. Jimmy Savile would come in at tea-time for a meal and we all used to laugh because we thought he was a bit odd. 'He would flirt with the waitresses but seemed to make a fuss of me and always did things like drop cutlery on the floor and ask me to pick it up. 'He would also leave me massive tips. It was great if you smiled and were nice to him. But one time he really groped my bottom, not just a brush it was awful. 'Later I told my mum and she was livid. She wanted to go to the police but I  wouldn’t. Eventually I just left my job. 'I always hated seeing his picture after what happened. But if speaking out helps other people to come forward, if they are being abused, then I am happy to talk about it.'","Faye Sarr was 14 at the time and Savile was in his 70s .

"By . Steve Doughty . PUBLISHED: . 09:28 EST, 29 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 18:21 EST, 29 August 2012 . The number of deaths due to heroin dropped by a quarter last year, it emerged yesterday. The Office for National Statistics said there are now indicators Britain has fewer hard drug users. There were 596 deaths, which doctors and inquests said were due to heroin or morphine overdoses, in 2011 compared to 791 in 2010 and nearly 900 in 2008. Drug-related deaths: While deaths caused by heroin dropped substantially since supplies dried up, deaths caused by methadone, the legal substitute, have risen . The fall was caused by a ‘heroin . drought’ as supplies dried up on the street making it more difficult for . addicts to buy and more harder to find heroin of high purity on sale . from dealers. Fewer heroin users died despite the fears of drug abuse workers and campaigners that the shortage would mean more fatalities among addicts whose tolerance level for the drug fell in the longer period between hits, the Office for National Statistics said. It said: ‘Evidence suggests that from October 2010 there has been a heroin drought in the UK.’ The figures indicate that the country has fewer hard drug users and a falling demand for heroin. The ONS also said that deaths caused by cocaine - a drug that has become increasingly widespread in Britain over the past decade - have dropped to their lowest level since 2008. The falling numbers of deaths from hard drugs came in a week when new scientific evidence that cannabis can harm the development of teenagers was published. Drop in deaths: Cocaine deaths dropped to 112, fewer than half the 235 recorded in 2008 . The findings are thought likely to push . down still further the declining numbers of young people using the drug . once claimed to be entirely safe by supporters of decriminalisation. But the ONS figures had one bleak . spot. There were more deaths among users of methadone, the legal heroin . substitute prescribed to heroin users which is designed to avoid . withdrawal symptoms while not giving the same ‘high’. Methadone deaths rose from 355 in 2010 to 486 in 2011. There were 596 deaths which doctors and inquests said were due to heroin or morphine overdoses in 2011 compared to 791 in 2010 and nearly 900 in 2008. Cocaine deaths dropped to 112, down from 144 in 2010, and fewer than half the 235 recorded in 2008. The ONS said: ‘Evidence suggests that from October 2010 there has been a ‘heroin drought’ in the UK, with shortages in the availability of heroin continuing in some areas in 2011/12. ‘This heroin drought has resulted in typical street heroin purity falling from 46 per cent in September 2009 to around 32 per cent in September 2010, and down again to 19 per cent in July to September 2011. 'Drugs workers were concerned that the heroin drought may result in more drug-related deaths, as users who had developed a reduced tolerance could overdose if they used a high quality batch of heroin.’ But the report said: ‘ONS data show the opposite trend with deaths involving heroin falling in recent years. ‘There was a significant decline in the proportion of 16 to 59-year-olds reporting use of heroin between 2009/10 and 2010/11. 'Moreover, the number of adults newly entering treatment for heroin and crack use has fallen by 15 per cent in two years.’ The ONS said the decline is ‘probably due to reduced demand'.","Number of deaths caused by heroin dropped by a quarter last year .

The rollercoaster is thought to be Vekoma's Waikiki Wave Super Flip, a model that has been around in some form for around 20 years. Scroll down for video .

Vekoma was founded in 1926 by Hendrik op het Veld under the name 'Veld Koning Machinefabriek' and at first manufactured agricultural machinery and mining equipment. During the company's signature ride, visitors are strapped in with harnesses to what at first looks like a typical 'top spin' rollercoaster, the Geekologie video shows. It has one crucial difference, however. The arms can bend in all directions, allowing for diagonal twists and turns rather than only horizontal. It allows one side of the nail-biting ride to travel in a clockwise direction, while the other moves in an anti-clockwise direction.

Incredible: Michelle Bonfield from Barkway in Hertfordshire, lost 10 per cent of her body weight in just seven weeks while attending an obesity clinic . A cancer survivor who has spent five years dieting to qualify for vital breast reconstruction surgery has slammed health chiefs for denying her the operation, even though she has shed nine stone. Michelle Bonfield, 45, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005 and endured months of gruelling chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The mother-of-two, who weighed 25 stone, beat the disease, but had to have her ovaries removed as well as a large section of her right breast. Doctors told her that she could not have breast reconstruction on the NHS unless she lost weight. So Mrs Bonfield, from Barkway, Hertfordshire,  spent five years battling to lose nine stone and dropped from a dress size 32 down to a 16. But despite her life-changing weight loss Mrs Bonfield, who now weighs 16 stone, has been told she still cannot have surgery she craves until she reaches 13.5 stone. Devastated Mrs Bonfield today argued that she had hit a natural ceiling in her weight loss, but has already shown her commitment to a healthier lifestyle. The angry mother slammed NHS bosses as penny-pinching and said dogmatic rules failed to take into account individual circumstances like hers. Mrs Bonfield claims part of the extra weight she has been left struggling to shift is down to the excess skin, left hanging off her body. She said her confidence was shattered after her breast operation and she has already shown how much getting her feminine curves back means to her. Mrs Bonfield said: 'I am so frustrated because they are not taking into consideration how far I have come. 'When I look at my body I wonder . where the weight is going to go from. Also they are not taking into . account the weight of my excess skin. 'I . do not agree with the BMI system. Many rugby players are well over . their BMIs because they are so muscly - but no-one would refuse them an . operation. 'If I want to pay then the private consultant is quite willing to operate on me. 'I . can understand the argument that I made myself obese so I should pay . for a tummy tuck, but I did not make myself get the ""big C"" so I should . be allowed reconstruction like everyone else.' Survivor: Mrs Bonfield, 45, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005 and endured months of grueling chemotherapy and radiotherapy . She added: 'It is all down to pound signs for . the NHS. I have asked the consultant to consider the details of my case, . but they say they have to stick to the guidelines. 'You . cannot really tell that one breast is smaller than the other when I am . dressed, but I can see the difference when I look down at my chest. 'It has affected me in myself. When I go swimming, or even go out I just don’t feel as confident as I used to. Fighting fit: Mrs Bonfield says her confidence was shattered after her breast operation and she should be allowed the reconstructive surgery as she has shown a big commitment to her new healthy lifestyle . 'I am still focused on getting my BMI down and I will never put the weight back on. But I strongly believe I should be allowed reconstruction now.' Mrs Bonfield was 38 when she found a lump in her right breast and doctors diagnosed her with grade three breast cancer. Surgeons removed part of her right breast including a 3cm lump and Michelle underwent seven months of chemotherapy and one of radiotherapy. Mrs Bonfield also took doctors advice to have a second operation to remove her ovaries 18 months later. In 2010 doctors gave Mrs Bonfield, who lives with her husband van driver husband Robert, 60, and children Cameron, 14, and Rowena, 13, the all clear. But she was disappointed to be told that her BMI of 57.6 - classed as super morbidly obese - was too high to qualify her for breast reconstruction. Mrs Bonfield started losing weight in 2007 with the help of the Addenbrooke’s Hospital obesity services. She was put on a diet of four pints of milk a day, a stock cube for salt, tablets for her bowels and a sugar-free jelly and given three months to lose 10 per cent of her body weight. Amazingly, Mrs Bonfield was successful in losing 10 per cent of her body weight in just seven weeks and after gradually reintroducing food she has managed a healthy diet ever since. But after five years of dieting Mrs Bonfield was been told she still needs to lose two-and-a-half stone to three-and-a-half stone. National NHS guidelines say patients must have a BMI between 27 and 30 in order to have breast reconstruction surgery and Mrs Bonfield’s consultant is happy to operate with a BMI of 30. Mrs Bonfield would also need a BMI of 27 to be allowed to have a tummy tuck to remove her excess skin, but in addition must hold that weight for two years.","Michelle Bonfield beat breast cancer after losing most of her right breast and her ovaries to the disease .

A toddler who is thought to be the only child in the world born with SIX separate heart defects has stunned doctors by making an incredible recovery - after they warned his parents he would not survive. Medics told Michelle and Darryl Lewis that their baby had an unheard of number of heart defects - and suggested they terminate the pregnancy at a 21-week scan. But the devastated couple refused - despite doctors’ fears that the baby would not survive the birth. However, despite a difficult birth and surgery at just eight-hours old, followed by four more operations, young Riley recovered. Although Riley will need to have further operations to replace heart shunts as he grows, medics are confident that Riley will be able to lead a normal life . Riley, pictured after his first operation, was born with six separate heart defects . He made such good progress that he was even well enough to be a pageboy at his parents’ wedding just seven months later. Michelle, 32, from Tunbridge Wells, Kent, said: 'The surgeons told us that it is nothing short of a miracle that Riley is here at all. 'Doctors told us having one heart defect was unlucky, but six was unheard of. They said he probably wouldn’t make it through the pregnancy, and even if he did, wouldn’t survive long after birth. 'We were devastated - but Darryl and I just turned to each other and we knew straight away there was no way either of us was going to give up on our baby. 'The rest of my pregnancy was terrifying - I lived in fear of something going wrong. 'When I went into labour, Riley’s heart stopped every time I had a contraction - we nearly lost him so many times. But he’s a tough little boy and he’s amazed all of us - he’s so strong, and we are so proud of him.' The couple had no idea there were any complications with Michelle’s pregnancy until their 21 week scan - when nurses struggled to hear the heartbeat clearly. Michelle was booked in for a specialist scan a week later at the Evelina Children’s Hospital, London, where the stunned couple were told the extent of Riley’s condition. They were warned their unborn child was suffering from a back-to-front valves, a large hole in the heart, as well as various conditions that made his arteries thick and made it difficult for blood to pump around the body. Riley, when he was a few days old: His heart stopped several times during his birth . Riley was well enough at seven months to act as pageboy at his parents wedding . Michelle said: 'The nurse’s face just dropped, and she went out of the room to get a doctor. 'I knew something was wrong and I just burst into tears before they had even told us what was wrong.It was the worst feeling I’ve ever experienced in my life.The doctors said our baby’s heart was struggling to pump blood around his body, and he had so many complications he wouldn’t live. 'They said they’d never seen anything like it - having so many conditions was totally unheard of. 'They took us into a little room and advised us to terminate the pregnancy - but there was no way we would even consider it. 'They agreed to monitor me closely throughout the rest of the pregnancy, but it was terrifying. I was always thinking the worst was going to happen, but Darryl kept me positive and was my rock. 'I was induced and went into labour on Christmas eve, and it lasted 15 terrifying hours before doctors decided to perform an emergency caesarean on Christmas day 2010. 'I heard this little scream and the nurses held him up for me to see before he was whisked away. I remember seeing his big beautiful eyes and just pleading that he would keep fighting.' Little fighter: Riley, bearing the chest scar following his heart operation . Riley was just eight hours old when he had his first heart surgery - an operation inserting a small balloon into enable his heart to pump blood through his arteries. His parents kept a vigil by his bedside, and when he was just five days old, he underwent further operation to insert a shunt into his arteries. And his terrified parents almost lost him again following an MRI scan when he was four months old - where the tot reacted violently to anaesthesis used to put him to sleep, causing his heart rate to shoot up to 260. Michelle added: 'After his first operation, the surgeon came out and said to us he had no idea how Riley was still here - he said it was a real miracle. 'We just spent every minute by his side. He was recovering from his second operation on New Year’s Eve, and all the fireworks were going off outside the London Eye, just across the river from the hospital. 'The nurses kept asking if we wanted to go outside and watch, but we just wanted to stay with our little boy. It was the best New Year I’ve ever had, the three of us together.' After five months in hospital, Riley was finally able to go home - and was even well enough to be pageboy at his parents’ wedding in July 2011. And despite needing a further three operations in the last twelve months, doctors are amazed by Riley’s progress - and say he is doing much better than expected. Although he will need to have further operations in the future to replace shunts as he grows, medics are confident that Riley will be able to lead a normal life. Darryl said: 'I just can’t thank all the doctors and nurses at St Evelina’s hospital enough. If it wasn’t for their hard work and dedication, we probably wouldn’t have our little boy - we’ll always be in their debt. 'We are just two normal people - we don’t drink a lot, we don’t do drugs, we’re quiet living - we couldn’t understand why this had happened to us or how to deal with it. 'But the doctors and nurses were amazing looking after Riley, and looking after us too. 'Riley is our little superstar.

"By . Simon Tomlinson . UPDATED: . 09:49 EST, 29 December 2011 . Star: Julie Goodyear, pictured at the 2005 National Television Awards, denies any knowledge of an Environment Agency probe . A farm owned by former Corrie actress Julie Goodyear is at the centre of an environmental probe over allegations that hazardous waste was dumped there illegally. Land at the 69-year-old star's Primrose Hill Farm in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, has been filled in to raise the ground level as part of work to build riding stables. But environment chiefs launched an investigation following allegations that the site was being filled in with illegal materials. Miss Goodyear, who played legendary Rovers Return landlady Bet Lynch for more than 30 years, said she has no knowledge of the probe. Work on the farm's horse arena was carried out by Roeacre Industries Ltd, of Heywood, after planning permission was granted by Rochdale town hall. The Environment Agency is investigating whether materials were illegally dumped at the farm and, if so, what enforcement action should be taken. Roeacre Industries company director Pete Cordwell said the allegations of illegal tipping were unfounded. He said: 'Everything we've done there is perfectly legal. As far as we're concerned it wasn't waste - it was for engineering purposes. We've used granular fill, material like bricks and stones, to build the horse arena.' Mr Cordwell added that no work had been carried out on the stables since last year. Probe: The investigation centres on whether illegal materials were dumped during the construction of riding stables at Miss Goodyear's home at Primrose Hill Farm (above) in Rochdale, Greater Manchester . Roeacre Industries ceased trading in 2010 and went into administration in January this year with debts of £350,000. The Environment Agency said that, if a firm is in administration, it can still prosecute a company director if the business is found to have breached tipping regulations. Construction and demolition waste can be considered hazardous under EU law especially if it contains dangerous substances such as asbestos or mercury. Farewell to Corrie: Miss Goodyear pictured as she leaves Coronation Street for the last time in 1995 after quitting her role as legendary Rovers Return landlady Bet Lynch . Mark Fowles, environment officer at . the Environment Agency, said: 'We are currently investigating a site at . Primrose Hill Farm, Heywood, Lancashire, following allegations of waste . being illegally tipped. 'Once . our investigation is complete we will consider what, if any, . enforcement action is required to ensure we continue to protect the . environment.' Miss Goodyear bought Primrose Hill Farm around 15 years ago and has ploughed hundreds of thousands of pounds into its renovation. Long run: Miss Goodyear as Bet lynch, with Betty Turpin and Gordon Lewis in 1984 . It is now known whether she was living at the property when the alleged offences took place. Her agent said the actress had no idea about the probe at the farm and did not wish to comment. She recently attended the funeral of Weatherfield icon Betty Williams and is rumoured to be making a comeback to the street.

"One third of Brits would be put off by potential partner based on post-date text . Avoid abbreviations and don't double text . By . Bianca London . PUBLISHED: . 18:33 EST, 25 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 18:33 EST, 25 September 2012 . The post-date text is always an awkward one. But if you have have found yourself struggling to compose the perfect message, you are not alone as it has been revealed that British singles spend an average of fourteen and a half minutes writing that first post-date text. And it is certainly time well spent because, according to the new survey, almost a third of singles surveyed admitted that they would be put off a potential partner based . on the content of their post-date text. In the new era of dating, texting is vital and the average Brit spends fourteen and a half minutes composing a post-date text . But be very content cautious as the biggest text turn-off was bad spelling, closely followed by abbreviations (such as gr8 and l8r) and then acronyms such as LOL, ROFL or LMAO. 'Double texting' (not waiting for a reply before sending another text), one word messages and using smiley faces were all also cited as major faux pas for the discerning dater. The report, carried out by match.com for their upcoming LoveGeist report, also shows that single men are 60 per cent more likely than women to get a friend to check their post-date texts before sending them. Women believe it is up to their date to send the first post-date text . The burden of post-date ‘textiquette’ is borne mainly by men, with over half of the single women surveyed saying that the first text after a first date is the responsibility of their date. In fact only 16 per cent of women believe they should take it upon themselves to send the first message. Match.com’s resident relationship expert, Kate Taylor, said: 'In recent years the way we use technology to communicate after a date has made the post-date follow-up more important than ever. 'Not only do you now need to perform well on the date itself, if your follow-up message isn’t up to scratch, then you might be out of contention for a second meeting.' Taylor adds: 'Last year’s LoveGeist discovered that one of the best-known rules of modern dating, waiting three days before getting back in touch after a date, was a thing of the past, and this year’s report has again shown how technology is changing how we connect and date. 'The advent of online dating, email and texting has meant that written communication is now more important than ever in impressing a potential partner, which is great news for those fluent in the language of love.' Do you have ‘Textual Chemistry’? Top tips for staying on message from match.com’s resident relationship expert, Kate Taylor: . 1. Texts should be light-hearted and tantalising. Don’t use them for . outpourings of emotion, whether positive or negative. Instead, regard . them as the electronic equivalent of a flirty water-cooler moment. A . cute little way to say, 'great to meet you' and not much more. 2. Be mysterious. Don’t feel obliged to answer every text. In fact, it’s . better if you don’t, as they will likely just come running back for . more. 3. Don’t treat . texts like your Facebook status. Sending texts and picture texts of all . the fun stuff you’re doing all the time won’t make you look busy and . popular, it’ll make you look like you’re thinking of messages you can . send ALL THE TIME, even when you’re out doing fun stuff. That’s not . healthy. 4. Take it . one text at a time. Don’t worry if you don’t get a reply straight away! And never send a 'Did you get my message?' text. They got it, so forget . you sent it and get on with your day. 5. Keep it humorous. There’s no need to roll-out the knock-knock jokes, . but a mushy message written in a funny way is 100 times more appealing . than one written seriously. And it would be less embarrassing if they . were to show it to their friends.","One third of Brits would be put off by potential partner based on post-date text .

Nadia Wearn, 31, had been to hospital to complain of pains down her left arm, chest and back, but was advised they were probably due to how she held her baby daughter, the hearing was told. She was told to take painkillers but, less than three hours later, she collapsed at her home in South Shields, Tyne and Wear, in front of her mother. Advised to take painkillers : Nadia Wearn, pictured with husband Jason, died only hours after visiting hospital . The inquest, held at South Shields Register Office, heard that Mrs Wearn visited South Tyneside District Hospital on June 1 last year. She was sent away after being told the pains were down to the way she was holding her 13-week-old daughter Ava. Mrs Wearn’s mum Pauline, who has 40 years' nursing experience, broke down in tears at the inquest as she described how her daughter collapsed. 'Nadia was sitting on the sofa and then she just leaned forward and said ""faint"",' she said. 'I told her to sit back and I shouted to (Mrs Wearn's husband) Jason to get the baby and told him to call an ambulance. 'I pulled her on to the floor. There was no pulse. I started CPR, but there was just nothing. 'The ambulance seemed to take ages to arrive. Her lips were blue, I just held her on the floor, kept doing CPR. Tragedy: The dance teacher was told her pains were probably due to how she held her baby daughter . 'I checked her pulse and there was nothing. She had gone.' Home Office pathologist Stuart Hamilton, who conducted a post-mortem on Mrs Wearn's body, found the cause of death to be 'unascertained'. Coroner Terence Carney was told that Mrs Wearn had been assessed as a minor injury patient, and no Electrocardiography (ECG) or blood tests had been carried out to try to find out the cause of her pain. When asked why, Dr Soni Shrestha, who examined Mrs Wearn, replied: 'All her findings were normal.' The doctor added: 'There was no indication for blood tests so I did not feel I had to do the blood tests. 'If she had been presenting cardiac symptoms like a crushing chest pain and pain to her left side, if she was a heavy drinker or smoker, then I would have had a think about it. 'She did not appear anxious, not to me. All her vitals were fine.' Dr Shrestha told the inquest that she had told Mrs Wearn that if the symptoms worsened to come back to accident and emergency. Dr Peter Goode, a specialist consultant at Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary, said that in his opinion Mrs Wearn ‘should have’ had an ECG and blood tests. He added: 'The question remains for me whether first of all should there have been a different course of action and, if a different course of action had been followed, could this have reduced or prevented her death? 'She should have had a chest x-ray, an ECG and blood tests. 'If those investigations had been done, could this have presented this lady's death or reduced the risk? 'If they had been abnormal in some way, she would have been admitted to hospital. 'The difficulty we have is we don’t have a subsequent diagnosis from the post-mortem.' Coroner Terence Carney heard that Mrs Wearn was assessed as a minor injury patient at the hospital . Dr Goode said that, had the cause of the collapse been due to a blood clot, the outcome would have been the same. But he added: 'If it was a sudden cardiac change, the chances of survival would have been better in hospital.' The inquest heard that Mrs Wearn, who had suffered from a hereditary blood disorder, was readmitted to hospital. Medics tried to save her by giving her thrombolysis treatment, but she was pronounced dead an hour later. The inquest continues.","Dance teacher Nadia Wearn collapsed within three hours of being sent home from hospital, inquest heard .

The British businesswoman accused of having drunken sex in the back of a Dubai taxi has admitted she can't remember what happened because she had been drinking for 10 hours straight. Rebecca Blake, 29, from Dorking, Surrey, has been sacked from her £100,000 a year job as a recruitment consultant and is facing a prison sentence after her alleged tryst with Irish welder Conor McRedmond. Speaking out for the first time since her arrest, Miss Blake insisted she had only been in the taxi for five minutes before the driver reported her to police - but admitted 'I'm no saint' and that she'd drunk so much the whole incident is a 'blur'. She also described her five days of hell in Bur Dubai women’s holding prison, where she was bitten by cockroaches. Fired: A tearful Rebecca Blake has lost her job at recruintment firm Manpower . Miss Blake told The Sun how the day, on May 4, started at noon with a four-hour-long all-you-can-drink brunch at Dubai's exclusive Rotana Hotel. She told the newspaper: 'There’s constant alcohol - your drink won’t even be half gone before you get given a new one. I was table hopping, drinking white wine and just generally having a great time. Rebecca Blake, 29, pictured, and Conor McRedmond were arrested after an all-day drinking binge . 'I don’t know how much I had, they just kept filling up the glass. 'I like to party and I like to drink. I’m a single girl with a good job and I am no saint. 'It had been a great day - I was dancing and drinking from 12 noon till gone 10 at night. The 29-year-old and her friends carried on drinking at the hotel for another two hours, before heading off to another bar, where the party continued until after 10pm. At 10.30, Miss Blake and her friend Conor McRedmond, 28, decided to go home. The pair hailed a cab towards Dubai Marina. Minutes later they were spotted in a passionate embrace by the driver in his rear view mirror, according to police reports. Incensed by their behaviour, the driver stopped and complained to police in a patrol car parked nearby. When he returned with an officer, they allegedly saw Miss Blake having sex on the back seat of the cab with Mr McRedmond. Miss Blake refused to discuss what went on in the taxi, but admitted the events are a blur. She said: 'We were only in the taxi for five minutes before the driver pulled over. I can’t speak about anything in the cab for legal reasons. But I didn’t know what was going on. It is all a blur and I don’t really remember how it all came about.' The pair were held for five days and accused of having sex outside marriage and being drunk in a public place – both criminal offences in the strict Islamic state. Upset: Miss Blake, who worked as a recruitment consultant, has denied the allegations against her . Leaving: Miss Blake, who denies the allegations, faces up to three years in jail if convicted . Miss Blake described her time behind bars as 'hell' and revealed she suffered a panic attack after waking up to find cockroach bites on her face. She's currently free on bond, but faces up to three years in jail if convicted - and is terrified of the prospect of going back to prison. She said: 'Looking back I literally went from having fun dancing in the sun to an underground dungeon hell in a matter of hours. I must have dozed off a little bit (in her cell) because when I woke up I had a cockroach bite on my face. It was vile - the worst nightmare you could possibly imagine. I had a panic attack and thought, ‘s***, I am in prison.’ I was literally terrified. I am preparing myself for going back to prison and I really don’t know how to cope with it. I don’t know if I will. It could finish me if I have to go back inside that hell-hole.' Mr McRedmond, who is thought to work for an engineering firm, also denies the charges.

While most may see the local public pool as a respite from the summer heat, one in five sees it as a bathroom. A shocking new survey claims that a full 20 per cent of those swimming and splashing about also relieve themselves in it. Furthermore, red-eyes that often associated with a day at the pool are from chloramine, the chemical created when urine combines with the chlorine that's already in the pool, not from the water treatment chemical. Jumping in: A survey shows that one out of five adults pees in the pool . The survey was conducted by the Water . Quality and Health Council, and reveals a number of statistics that may . make pool-goers think twice before diving in. While it did not exhaustively look into the reasons behind why people think they can urinate in a public pool, the survey suggests that it is easy and anonymous. However, Dr Chris Wiant, who serves as chair of the Water Quality and Health Council said that is the wrong way to think. ‘No matter how easy it is to pee anonymously in the pool, swimmers should avoid doing so and take their children on frequent bathroom breaks,’ he said. Dr Wiant also places responsibility on those working at the pool, adding: ‘Pool operators should also monitor and maintain proper pool water chemistry, especially pH and chlorine levels.’ According to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, it is the ‘first defence against germs that can make swimmers sick.’ But the cringe-worthy results don’t stop . there – the survey reveals that nearly 70 per cent of people taking a . dip do not shower beforehand. Human slurry: Moreover, 70 per cent of people said they didn't shower before taking a dip . The Council said that while it may seem . counter-intuitive or redundant to rinse off before jumping in the pool, . it is essential for the health of all of those around. While this may seem harmless, people who . enter the pool without showering are essentially treating the pool as a . communal bath, the study says. When things like makeup, . sunscreen, bug spray, perfume, deodorant, sweat, and dirt that, mix with chlorine and other pool chemicals, they can cause significant irritation. According to the CDC, many diseases spread through pool because people do not shower before jumping in, bringing dirt, sweat, and sunscreen into the water with them. Everyone planning to take a plunge should first shower - a simple 15 to 30 second rinse is all it takes. Those who are sick or have diarrhea should also avoid the pool to avoid transmitting diseases by the water. Adults should use the restroom once every hour, and those with children should follow the same rules. Children's diapers should be checked every 30-60 minutes. If a pool has a ripe or pungent smell, it should ostensibly be avoided, as chemically balanced pools emit no odour. The report says that the famous ‘pool smell’ results not from the chlorine, but from the slurry of water impurities swimmers bring in by not showering reacting with the pool’s chemicals. That is to say, the more strong-smelling a pool is, the more contaminated it is as well. The Council notes that a well-maintained pool with the proper pH balance has no discernible odour. Michele Hlavsa, the Chief of CDC’s Healthy Swimming Program told MailOnline that urine in the water creates two problems. ‘The first is that the urine eats up the chlorine to kill the germs,’ she said. ‘The other problem is that urine contains nitrogen – like personal care products – which create chloramine.’ Chloramine, a combination of chlorine and ammonia, is what causes itchy red eyes after a swim, not the chlorine that is used to treat the water. She continued: ‘A healthy pool doesn’t smell – the smell is coming from the personal care products mixing with the chlorine.’ Ms Hlavsa, an RN with a Masters of Public Health, offered several tips for safe swimming. ‘It’s really important for swimmers to take bathroom breaks regularly once and hour,’ she said, adding that children’s diapers should be checked once every 30 to 60 minutes. But the crux of the matter is simple. ‘It’s all about good hygiene,’ Ms Hlavsa said. ‘Even just rinsing in water for 15 or 30 seconds gets ride of the personal care products.’ In an effort to make the public aware of the importance of good poolside hygiene, the CDC expert said education is key. ‘Another step,’ she said, ‘is the Model Aquatic Health Mode. The CDC is developing this resource for state and local health departments of model standards,’ as there is no federal regulatory authority responsible for disinfected water parks and pools. The MAHC includes rethinking the design of locker rooms and pool houses so that swimmers pass the showers before entering the pool, and making warm water readily available so there are no intended cold showers before a relaxing dip on a hot day.","Survey by Water Quality and Health Council reveals one in five adults urinate in swimming pools .

London hospital of ‘gross failure’ today, following the death of a three-year-old girl in a paediatrics intensive care unit. Isla Taylor was admitted to St . George’s Hospital in south London in June 2011 to undergo surgery to . repair her trachea, but died five days later from brain damage caused by . hypotension after days of low blood pressure which medics failed to . spot. Westminster coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox . today said Isla’s death was ‘avoidable’ and that staff in the paediatric . intensive care unit (PICU) failed to give Isla ‘basic medical care’ that would have brought her low blood pressure under control and saved . her life. Isla was born six weeks premature and had repeatedly contracted chest infections because of problems with her lungs . Delivering a narrative verdict Dr . Wilcox said: ‘The blood pressure was unacceptably low. Maintenance of . blood pressure, in my view, is basic medical care wherever you are. ‘It was a gross failure on the part of . the PICU staff not to do something effective to manage it. It was . unacceptably low for hour after hour on June 25 and 26. They should have . appreciated that it was low, their lack of appreciation in my view is a . gross failure.’ Isla's parents paid tribute to their daughter. They said: 'She absolutely loved life' She added: ‘I have found that the test . of neglect has in this narrow area on behalf of paediatric intensive . care unit staff has been met.’ Expert witness Dr Andrew Durward, a . consultant in paediatric intensive care at London’s Evelina children’s . hospital, said Isla’s doctors had been ‘blinkered’ into accepting low . blood pressure because of her complex medical history. He said: ‘The complexity of this . patient almost blinkered the response in terms of accepting the low . numbers of blood pressure. It is a basic failure of medical care. ‘This patient had a blood pressure of . 40 for days and that is unusual. I’ve never in my life seen anyone with a . blood pressure so low for so long in my 14 years as a consultant. You . can treat it so easily.’ Isla, from Twickenham in west London, . was born six weeks premature and had repeatedly contracted chest . infections because of problems with her lungs. she was admitted to the . hospital on June 23 for elective surgery on her airways. But she was the victim of a catalogue . of errors which began when doctors inserted a breathing tube into her . mouth rather than her nose causing problems when she was sedated. The tube was later moved to the wrong . part of her lung when vital information about her medical history was . not handed over to new doctors taking over her care, Westminster . Coroner’s Court heard. Dr Caroline Davison, a consultant . paediatric anaesthetist in intensive care, said other doctors at the . hospital had ‘failed’ to tell her not to move Isla’s breathing tube . during the shift hand-over. She said: ‘I think anything about an . airway that hasn’t been handed over would have been a serious failure. It is not an ordinary failure, it is more than an ordinary failure. Bolt . and door it should have been handed over.’ Echoing this concern, Dr Wilcox said: . ‘The failure of the anaesthetist to specifically hand over to PICU the . reason why the ET tube inserted at 14cm there was a gross failure in . care and this was a failure in basic medical care. It is something that . was critical.’ Dr Wilcox also found that antibiotics . should have been given to Isla earlier, and again branded the omission a . ‘really serious failure’ given Isla’s propensity to contracting chest . infections. Isla was due to undergo surgery to repair her trachea, but died five days later from brain damage . Robust new procedures to change the way patients like Isla¿s are treated have been put in place at St George¿s, the court heard . After three days in hospital Isla’s . condition deteriorated rapidly on June 26, her blood pressure could . barely be detected and she had to be resuscitated. A CT scan taken the following morning . showed severe brain injuries which ‘shocked’ doctors treating the . patient. Isla died at 2.30pm the next day, on June 28. Isla’s parents Stephen Taylor and . Nicola Roberts, who broke down in tears as they heard the verdict read . out, paid tribute to their ‘energetic little girl’ in a statement read . out in court. They said: ‘Isla was a very energetic little girl, she absolutely loved life. ‘She had dropped all daytime naps and . there was no sign of any problems other than stated and her chest . infections was something the surgery was hopefully going to help.’ Robust new procedures to change the . way patients such as Isla are treated have been put in place at St . George’s, the court heard. Dr Frances Elmslie, a consultant . clinical geneticist at St George’s who oversaw the changes, said today . that medics have to discuss the positioning of a patient’s tube if there . is a possibility they will go into intensive care, and that the level . of sedation has been reduced.

The 16-year-old Indian girl - whose . father was in the studio at the time - told how he had allegedly . poisoned three people in a dispute over jewellery. Her admission came as she told how she was scared of returning home to her family after she eloped and married. The claims on the show in Chennai, . India, resulted in police going to her father's village home - and . finding three bodies buried in the backyard. Shocking: The teenage girl (pictured right) claimed on live TV in India that her father was a triple murderer . Accused: The host of the live programme was left stunned as the 16-year-old girl told how her father (pictured left during the show) allegedly poisoned three people in a dispute over jewellery . But the father was not detained when . the accusation was made, and has now gone on the run after telling his . wife she would never see him alive again. Now the hunt is on for the father, . identified only as A. Murugan, who is wanted for questioning over the . murder of a neighbour, his young daughter and son-in-law. The teenage girl has not been . identified after she broke down in tears on the TV show, but police have . praised her for her courage in naming her father as a murderer. She had been asked to appear on the show to talk about how she had eloped with her 21-year-old boyfriend a month ago. Her parents, father Murugan and . mother Rajeswari, who live in Nallanpillal Petral village, in southern . India, were also invited to be on the show. As the girl and her parents . constantly argued with the TV cameras focused on them, the show's host . tried to quieten everyone down. He suggested they should all make amends and go home together. But it was then that the girl, who . had secretly married her boyfriend after eloping, told host Nirmala . Periyasamy that she would not go home with her father because she was . terrified that he would murder her and her new husband - just as he had . allegedly slain three others. Startling: A teenage Indian girl invited on to the Solvathellam Unmai TV chat show made the claim that her father was a triple murderer . 'The girl was constantly telling us that she was afraid of her father, as he may murder her and her husband' said the host. 'When I repeatedly questioned her, the girl broke down and told us that her father had murdered three persons in their house in 2008.' The reality show Solvathellam Unmai on the Zee Tamil channel ended with the parents and girl still arguing before Murugan and his wife left to return to their village on their own. But police said that the father was furious with his wife for backing up their daughter's claims on TV. 'He abused his wife on the bus going back to their village,' said an officer. The husband got off the bus before it reached the village, telling his wife she would never see him alive again. When police went to the village and started digging up the backyard they found the remains of a man, his 20-year-old daughter and her 22-year-old husband. Police said the three had left gold jewellery with Murugan for safekeeping but when they asked for it to be returned, he refused. 'He decided to eliminate them and keep the gold,' said Deputy Police Superintendent Gopal Sekar. 'So he gave them food laced with poison and then buried them in his backyard.' A manhunt is continuing for Murugan. 'We would never have known about these murders if the girl had not spoken about them on the TV show,' said Supt Sekar.","TV show host stunned as 16-year-old girl accuses her father of poisoning three people in jewellery dispute .

The father of the suspected rogue trader Kweku Adoboli said he believed his son 'made a mistake or wrongful judgement.' Speaking from his home in Tema, Ghana, retired United Nations employee John Adoboli said the family 'were heartbroken' at the news of his son's arrest. He said: 'We are all here reading all the materials and all the things being said about him. 'The family is heartbroken because this is not our way of life. 'I brought them up to be God-fearing and to appreciate decency.' Mr Adoboli, who was arrested at his desk on Thursday September 15, is alleged to have lost £1. 3 billion through his rogue trades. The scandal wiped £4 billion off the value of shares in UBS, affecting thousands of pensioners whose funds had invested in the company. The loss uncovered by UBS is almost exactly the same amount the bank was trying to save by cutting 3,500 jobs from its worldwide empire. Before he was arrested, he had changed his status on his Facebook page to 'I need a miracle'. Mr Adoboli, who until recently lived in a £1,000-a-week loft apartment in the City, is described by friends as 'a really relaxed, happy guy'.Yesterday Mr Adoboli wept as he was accused of gambling away a record £1.3billion. He wiped tears from his eyes as his alleged crimes at Swiss banking giant UBS were outlined in court. The former public schoolboy, who later smiled broadly outside court, has been charged with fraud and false accounting. Speaking from the family home in Tema, Ghana, Kweku Adoboli's father said his son is 'decent and hardworking' Adoboli appeared in court hours after it was reported he had alerted his employers to unauthorised deals. UBS’s internal controls had not picked up the huge losses allegedly generated by Adoboli, according to the BBC. The bank then examined his trading positions and called in the Financial Services Authority and the police. The case has intensified calls for greater regulation of banks, in particular for those engaged in high-risk trading. Initially Adoboli  worked in a back-office role but quickly rose through the ranks to become a trader. He . was an employee who ‘did his own thing’ and ‘started to go awry’ in . 2008, hiding his losses in a series of false trades, magistrates were . told. By Thursday he had lost $1.5billion and had sold positions that would cost a further $500million. Dressalikes: Rogue trader Nick Leeson arrives at Heathrow Airport yesterday . David . Levy, prosecuting, said Adoboli involved himself in trades that were . highly dangerous for the bank and used various means to cover up his . improper conduct. ‘He may . well have made some profits, on one occasion up to $20million, but . losses followed,’ he added. ‘It carried on for three years. He continued . to take risks, gambling the money of UBS bank. UBS equities trader Kweku Adoboli leaves City of London Magistrates Court in central London after his appearance about a fraud charge .

A couple with 65 cats have been kicked out of their home after health inspectors found it was jam-packed with rubbish - finding 15 dead cats underneath old bin bags. Christopher and Elizabeth Blore were ordered out of their property in Kingsbury in Brent, northwest London, after council workers were left staggered at the mess - which reached from floor to ceiling in most rooms. The couple were told not to return for three months so the council could clear the rubbish up and fumigate the house. Disgusting: Elizabeth and Christopher Blore kept 65 cats at their home in Brent . Brent Council was made aware of the situation by neighbours more than two years ago after they complained of a ‘putrid smell’, and after a protracted battle with the couple they finally managed to get them out of the house last week. The council, who will have to remove 30 tons of rubbish from the house between now and August, have successfully won an Asbo against the couple banning them from keeping or feeding cats. Sergeant Liam Tierney said: 'It was . only when taking statements from the neighbours that we realised what a . devastating effect the Blores where having on their everyday lives. Unbelievable: Brent council will have to remove 30 tonnes of rubbish from the Blore's home between now and August . Shocking: Bin bags were found piled up to the ceiling and empty cans of cat food littered the floor . 'I could appreciate at first hand the smell and whilst serving the order I have never come across a property so hazardous to health.' Cllr Lincoln Beswick, of Brent Council, said he was pushing to get the couple to pay the clean up costs, adding: 'Everyone has the right to the peaceful enjoyment of their home, whether it is privately or socially owned. 'The Blore’s family way of life infringed on their neighbour’s rights, health and wellbeing, so partners worked together to enforce a Nuisance Premises Closure and Asbo. 'Taxpayers should not foot the bill as this family have infringed on their neighbours’ rights, health and wellbeing.' Carly Webber, of the Mayhew Animal Home, where the 65 cats were taken to for treatment said many had to be put down as they were so ill. Rotting rubbish: Neighbours first complained to the council about the Blores two years ago . Distressing: Officials found the remains of three dead cats under the unbelievable levels of waste . She said that council workers should ‘expect to find more dead cats’ in the house, adding: 'The filth that they were living in is unbelievable.' One neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'The smell was truly horrendous. 'This couple just took in more and more cats until they completely overran the place and combined with the floor-to-celing rubbish it meant you could smell the house as soon as you turned into the street.' A spokesman for Brent Council said this week: 'Neighbours had complained about the revolting smell and distressing build up of cat faeces in their gardens and the council’s public health team, who inspected the property on several occasions, found it was full of rotting rubbish and cat faecal matter. 'Since 2010 council environmental officers had taken a number of steps to support the tenants in clearing the property, however Mr and Mrs Blore had continued to ignore notices and advice about dealing with the build up of rubbish and the welfare of the cats. 'During the clear up, enforcement officers also discovered the decomposed remains of dead cats.' The couple are due to be allowed back into the house on August 23.","Christopher and Elizabeth Blore have been ordered out of their home while the council remove 30 tons of waste .

A 14-year-old girl was repeatedly raped at a drug den by a gang of men who treated her with 'indignity and contempt', a jury has heard. The teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was taken to the house in Brierfield, Lancashire, and allegedly passed around for their sexual gratification. The 'principal defendant', Mohammed Imran Amjad, 25, bore the 'greatest responsibility for the corruption and abuse of the victim in this case', said the Crown Prosecution Service. A girl, 14, was taken to a house in Brierfield, Lancashire, and . allegedly passed around for the sexual gratification of a gang of men. Omar Mazafar (left), 21, denies aiding and abetting rape; Mohammed Zishan Amjad (centre), 24, and Haroon Mahmood (right), 22, deny rape and engaging in sexual activity with a child . Mohammed Suleman Farooq (left), 22, denies sexual assault, engaging in sexual activity with a child and witness intimidation. Also pictured are Omar Mazafar (centre) and Mohammed Zishan Amjad, arriving at Burnley Crown Court . He befriended the girl when she was 12 or 13 and frequently took her for drives in his cars, it is alleged. Prosecutor Alaric Bassano told Burnley Crown Court: 'It was him who took her on many occasions to the house and him who assisted, encouraged and incited others to rape and sexually assault this girl. 'On one occasion, he raped the girl himself. Over a period of time he subdued her will and coerced her into submission.' He said three other men raped her and one man subjected her to a sexual assault. The alleged victim was about 12, the prosecutor said, when her general behaviour deteriorated. She could be aggressive, disobedient towards her mother, refusing to go to school and staying out late at night, he added. The girl told police that her mobile telephone number was given to Imran Amjad, known to her as 'Immy', by another, and he called to ask to meet up. Three of the defendants are seen leaving Burnley Crown Court yesterday. The alleged victim was about 12, the prosecutor said, when her general behaviour deteriorated . She first met up with him when she was aged 13 and was driven around the streets of Burnley in his car every few days, she said. Her mother became concerned she spent so much time in his company and confronted him. Mr Bassano said the defendant’s response typified his 'arrogance', which he said would emerge in the trial. He said: 'When she told him about her age, and when she advanced her accusation that he was involved in an inappropriate relationship with her, he simply shrugged his shoulders and walked away. 'It is to be noted that he did not deny the allegation.' Her mother contacted the police in . December 2009 to report her concerns about her daughter’s welfare at the . hands of 'Immy', he said. Mr Bassano said the girl made no complaint at the time and continued to mix with Immy who, undeterred, went on to commit the numerous offences against her in 2010. All six defendants are from Brierfield. Imran Amjad denies abducting a child, rape, engaging in sexual activity with a child, aiding and abetting rape, and witness intimidation. He is also accused of intentionally encouraging or assisting the rape of the girl by a man known as 'Saj'. The 'principal defendant', Mohammed Imran Amjad, 25, bore the 'greatest responsibility for the corruption and abuse of the victim in this case', said the Crown Prosecution Service. Above, four of the defendants pictured yesterday . Haroon Mahmood, 22, denies rape and engaging in sexual activity with a child. Mohammed Zishan Amjad, 24, also denies rape and engaging in sexual activity with a child. Mohammed Suleman Farooq, 22, denies sexual assault, engaging in sexual activity with a child and witness intimidation. Shiraz Afzal, 25, and Omar Mazafar, 21, both deny aiding and abetting rape. All the sexual offences are said to have been committed between April and October 2010. In summary, Mr Bassano said: 'This case concerns the sexual exploitation and abuse of a 14-year-old girl. A number of men were involved in this abuse which involved planning and, on occasions, offenders acting together. 'The girl was groomed over a period of time and on many occasions she was taken to a house in Brierfield. 'That house was used as a den at which young men attended and brought or invited girls and young women in order to drink alcohol, take drugs and engage in sex. 'It was to this house that the girl was taken and at this house where she was sexually assaulted and raped by several adult males. 'During these times the girl was being passed between the men to be used for their own sexual gratification. The Crown contends that this girl was treated with indignity and contempt by them. 'All six defendants were involved, to a greater or lesser extent, in this sexual abuse.' The trial, expected to last six weeks, continues.

Murdered: Steven Grisales, 21, was stabbed through the heart by a 15-year-old boy who had ripped off his tag just days earlier . The full extent of how thugs on electronic tags routinely breach their curfews to commit more crimes is exposed today. A damning report reveals that nearly 60 per cent of offenders, supposedly confined to their homes, are free to walk the streets with impunity. Yesterday the human cost of the system’s  failure was laid bare when a 15-year-old who repeatedly flouted his tagging order was jailed for killing an innocent student. The boy is said to have ripped off his tag just days before stabbing Steven Grisales, 21, who had told him off for throwing a conker. But the council charged with monitoring the curfew didn’t bother to recall him to court because the breach happened on the eve of the August Bank Holiday weekend. Last night, the parents of the murdered  scholarship student spoke of their horror that the 15-year-old had broken his curfew so many times but nothing was done. His mother Jasmid said: ‘They can do anything that they want because the law won’t do anything. The police do their job – they take them in – but they just have to let them go.’ Their anger came as a damning report by  probation inspectors revealed gaping holes in the curfew regime, which allow offenders to roam the streets freely for hours at a time and not face further punishment. The chief inspector of probation, Liz Calderbank, said the rules ‘fall far short of what  people have a right to expect’. She added: ‘In our view you do not change  the behaviour of those who offend by giving them the impression that they are subject to stringent requirements only for them to find out they are not. If you are trying to change people’s behaviour you need to be setting clear and simple boundaries.’ Inspectors found a fifth of offenders placed on tags broke the rules but were let off with a warning, while a further 37 per cent committed a major breach and were hauled back before the courts. The report, published today, will raise major concerns about Justice Secretary Ken Clarke’s plans for a huge expansion of the number of tagged offenders. Probation officers predict the number could rise from 80,000 last year to 180,000. Scene of the crime: College Close, Edmonton, North London, where Mr Grisales was killed after remonstrating with youngsters who pelted him with stones . Mr Grisales was knifed in the heart by a member of a North London street gang who had a long record of violent robberies and burglaries. Just a month before the murder, the teenager was handed a youth rehabilitation order. Despite flagging his curfew conditions 20 times, he was not locked up. On August 26, he returned home four hours after the end of his 9pm curfew. Nothing was done and on August 31 he attacked Mr Grisales in the street. Yesterday, after the killer was jailed at the Old Bailey for ten and a half years, Mr Grisales’s father Andres said: ‘Ten and a half years for taking away our son, taking away his future, all of his plans. Everything was taken away from him – ten and a half years is a very short sentence.’ On the killer, who cannot be named because of a court order, he said: ‘It was amazing to learn how many offences he had committed before this – violent offences, robberies. He broke his curfew so many times and nothing was done.’ Mr Grisales’s killer was a member of the Northumberland Park Killers. The Old Bailey heard that the teenage gangster has convictions dating back to the age of 12 for robbery and violence but on each occasion he escaped with a community punishment. On July 28, 2011, he was ordered to wear an electronic tag, given a curfew and sentenced to a 12-month youth rehabilitation order for burgling a house. According to police, he broke his . curfew conditions more than 20 times, although Enfield Council, which . was supposed to be monitoring him, says there were only three . violations. The council said . that because the breach fell on a Bank Holiday, there was insufficient . time to bring him before the courts before the murder on August 31. Flawed system: An electronic tag strapped to the . ankle of a youngster. A report by probation inspectors . revealed gaping holes in the curfew regime, allowing offenders to roam . the streets freely for hours at a time . Prosecutors told the court the killer removed his tag on August 29, although this was disputed by the defence. Two days later, Mr Grisales was pelted with conkers at a train station in Edmonton, North London. When he confronted his attackers he was set upon. Terrified, he tried to defend himself with a  skateboard. But the 15-year-old pulled out a kitchen knife and plunged it into his heart. Mr Grisales died in hospital the next day. Critics say tagging is wrongly used as a cheap alternative to prison. Harry Fletcher, assistant general-secretary of probation union Napo, said: ‘The time is right for a thorough review of the effectiveness and efficiency of tagging to establish its impact, or not, on reoffending before the Government embarks on any massive roll-out.’ Justice minister Crispin Blunt said the Government wanted to ensure tags were used ‘as effectively as possible’. He added: ‘The call for a smarter, more integrated approach is very much in line with the Government’s initiatives in reducing reoffending and protecting the public.’","The 15-year-old killer of Steven Grisales had ripped off his tag just days before stabbing him through the heart in Edmonton, North London .

Promising tennis star Heather Watson lit up Wimbledon yesterday to become the first British woman to win at Centre Court in 27 years. The Guernsey-born 20-year-old, ranked 103rd in the world, beat a higher-ranked opponent in straight sets to provide the only ray of hope on an otherwise disappointing opening day for our players. She defeated the Czech Republic's Iveta Benesova 6-2, 6-1 to reach the second round in front of a cheering crowd on tennis's most famous stage. Triumph: British hope Heather Watson enjoyed a dream day on Centre Court, winning in straight sets . Write caption here . She has already got further in the tournament than five-time champion Venus Williams, who crashed out in straight sets to Russian Elena Vesnina - 6-1, 6-3. Thousands of fans roared Miss Watson to victory on a fine day when umbrellas were needed to protect from the sun rather than to keep off the rain. British men's number one Andy Murray will pick up the mantle today when he plays his first-round match this afternoon. His match against Nikolay Davydenko, the third scheduled match on Centre Court, is expected to start at about 5pm. Exciting: Miss Watson is through to the second round for the first time . Beaten: Iveta Benesova (left) had no answer to Miss Watson's scintillating play as the Brit won 6-2, 6-1 . The world number four admitted yesterday that he must 'find a way to do better and compete with the top three players' - Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer. Other Brits in action today include Jamie Baker, 25, who will play Andy Roddick on Court 1, and James Ward, 25, who takes on Pablo Andujar on court 14. In the women's competition, former British junior Wimbledon champion Laura Robson, 18, lost in three sets Francesca Schiavone in her first-round match on Court 3. Robson won the first set 6-2 against the 2010 French Open champion, but Schiavone recovered to take the last two sets, both by the margin of 6-4.

Miss Watson, who was beaten in the first round of Wimbledon in 2010 and 2011, played some sparkling tennis to knock out Miss Benesova, who was ranked more than 50 places above her. She appeared on Centre Court after a previous match between Ernests Gulbis and Tomas Berdych ended earlier than expected, with Gulbis winning in straight sets. Miss Watson said: 'This is my first singles win at Wimbledon in both the seniors and the juniors, so it was fantastic.' Over to you: Andy Murray takes a break during training. All eyes will be on him on Centre Court . Tough test: The British No 1 is due to play Nikolay Davydenko in the third match on Centre Court . The player, who is due to meet American Jamie Lee Hampton in the next round, had to wait until the evening to see where her match would be played, giving her little time to prepare. She said: ‘There was a lot of hanging around, at . one point I had a little nap, but I prepared myself well. ‘I had so much fun, the crowd was awesome, . I kept getting the tingles.’ Miss Watson is the first British woman to win a singles match on Centre Court since Jo Durie in 1985. The rain held off yesterday as thousands flocked to SW19, but spectators may not enjoy a dry day today with cloudier weather and some rain or fine drizzle possible. A beefed-up security presence is in place and police said the first day passed without any incidents. Djokovic and Federer both made it through their first-round matches yesterday, and Nadal is due to play today. Pleasant: Fans queuing for tickets got to laze in the sunshine as the rain stayed away . Nice start: The tournament began in fine weather and the players served up tennis to match . Crashing out: Miss Watson has already got further in the tournament than five-time champion Venus Williams, who lost in straight sets . Yesterday's winners in the ladies' singles included French Open champion Maria Sharapova. There was little cheer for British fans watching the action on the other courts. Former child actor Oliver Golding, 18, fell to seasoned Russian Igor Andreev and Basingstoke's Josh Goodall lost to world No 119 Grega Zemlja.

Tragedy: Six-year-old Sierra Newbold's death has been ruled a homicide Wednesday with an autopsy determining she had also been sexually assaulted . Police today launched a desperate hunt for the killer of 6-year-old Sierra Newbold, who was found dead in a canal near her West Jordan home, saying that no one has been ruled out of the search. They are warning Salt Lake City residents to be vigilant for a sexual predator, after an autopsy report revealed Sierra had been sexually assaulted. West Jordan Police Chief Doug Diamond warned parents to be on the lookout. ‘There is obviously a predator out there that is a monster, that has murdered a child,’ he said. Investigators said that no one is ruled out for Sierra’s murder at this point, Desert News reported. Little Sierra was discovered one hour after her mother reported her missing in the suburb of West Jordan and following an autopsy report it was confirmed she had been sexually assaulted. 'Our highest priority now is to identify, arrest, and successfully prosecute the person or persons responsible for this crime,' said Diamond . 'I share in the concern of our residents for the ongoing safety and security of our children.' The chief said he has increased police patrols in the area and is asking parents to take precautions to protect their children. 'If during the course of this investigation an imminent threat becomes known, we will share that information with our residents immediately,' he said. Scroll down for video . Young life: Pictured, right, in the arms of her mother and beside her other sisters, Sierra played on her local soccer team and had just graduated kindergarten according to family . Child's life: Sierra was described by family as outgoing, eager to make friends, and a young girl who loved to dance and draw . Diamond said the girl’s parents have been cooperating in the investigation. Officers found Sierra’s body in the canal about a block from her home, just 30 minutes after her mother “discovered she was not there and called us,” police Sgt. Drew Sanders said. Sanders declined to comment on any possible motive in the case. Investigators also are withholding a precise chain of events leading to the girl’s disappearance. 'We haven’t come to any conclusion,' Sanders said. He said police have 'tons of leads' and 'it’s paramount we find out who did this.' Police have said there were no signs of a break-in at the family’s home, and they declined to release any more details about the case.

Crime scene: The child's body was found in this four-foot-deep irrigation canal near her home about 30 minutes after her mother reported her missing . Homicide: Signs of foul play to the girl's body were not reported prior to the autopsy results released on Wednesday . 'Our contacts at the FBI have been helping us with that. They’ve been working on enhancing that [surveillance video],' Mr Sanders told Fox 13. Tragic morning: Sierra is pictured on the shoulders of her father, who had already left for work when she went missing . 'Right now, we do know that there are images on there and our investigators are analyzing that and trying to determine what use those are and if any evidence exists,' he said. He declined to say how long Sierra had been dead before discovered by police and if the autopsy was able to collect any DNA evidence, so as to not jeopardize their investigation, according to the Salt Lake City Tribune. Mr Sanders also declined to comment on any possible suspects or a motive in the case. 'We haven't come to any conclusion,' said Mr Sanders. He said police have 'tons of leads' and 'it's paramount we find out who did this.' The girl's dad had left for work some . time before her absence was noticed but her mother. Her younger sister and . elder brother were also at home. According to West Jordan Police Chief Doug Diamond on Tuesday, 'there was not a significant amount of trauma on the body,' he said speaking to the Tribune, leading to them being initially uncertain of whether foul play had occurred or not. Mr Sanders dismissed a neighborhood rumor on Wednesday that the girl's disappearance was connected to a weekend grass fire that gutted two houses and drew onlookers to the girl's neighborhood. Reed Newbold said the onlookers possibly widen the field of suspects. However, police determined the house fires were 'completely unrelated' to the girl's disappearance, Mr Sanders said. Without a trace: The girl's mother, pictured left with her husband, Sierra and other daughter, reported her missing from her bedroom in the early hours of Tuesday without any sign of a forced entry into their home .

A woman doused with white spirit and set alight by a spurned admirer told a police officer: 'I know I am going to die', a court heard. Disturbing footage of the night Stacey Mackie, 35, was fatally burned was shown on the first day of the trial of Terrence Armer, 61. Armer, of Kendal, Cumbria, is accused of murdering Miss Mackie, who died after a fire at the sheltered accommodation where she lived in Crag View, Kendal. The 61-year-old denies murder. Stacey Mackie, 35, from Cumbria, was allegedly doused in white spirit and set her alight after spurning her admirer Terrence Armer, 61 . Prosecutor Mr Timothy Storrie told Carlisle Crown Court that around midnight on January 27, Armer went to the flats and into Miss Mackie’s apartment. He said: 'Once inside, he poured a bottle of white spirit over Stacey Mackie and set her alight. The effect on her was catastrophic. '(The burns) covered 80 to 95 per cent of her body. Injuries of that magnitude are just not survivable.' The jury was shown a video interview with another resident of Crag View, Ian Raw, who encountered Armer outside the flats holding a small axe and a plastic carrier bag. Mr Raw rang police after Armer walked past him into the building and upstairs to Miss Mackie’s flat. CCTV footage played in court showed Armer using a screwdriver and the axe to try and break in, before Miss Mackie opened the door to him. Some minutes later police arrived at the door of the flat, trying to kick and barge their way in before finally using a ram to smash it open. Black smoke pouring into the corridor from the flat was so thick it obscured the view from the camera. Officers and fire crews were called to the home of Stacey Mackie in Kendal, Cumbria, on January 27. She later died . On the first day of the trial, Carlisle Crown Court was shown disturbing footage of the night Stacey Mackie, 35, was fatally burned . Footage taken from a camera worn by a police officer showed Miss Mackie sitting in the lobby of the building - her clothes almost entirely burned off and her hair singed. The court was told as a police officer tries to reassure her, she replied: 'I know I am going to die.' Mr Storrie said the bag Armer was carrying was later found to contain a large knife, a Stanley knife and a roll of tape. Miss Mackie, formerly from the coastal Cumbrian village of Haverigg, told police in the lobby that Armer was her attacker and 'he had set her alight and she was sure she was going to die', Mr Storrie said. Armer and Miss Mackie met last winter while they were both being treated at the ward of a local hospital for mental illness, Mr Storrie said. Although Miss Mackie’s mental illness meant she had her 'ups and downs' she had been well at the time of the alleged attack and there was no indication she was a risk to herself, he said. He said: 'Terrence Armer was known to have sought her companionship. He bought her presents and asked her to spend Christmas with him. He attached to the relationship a special significance she did not share.' After the pair fell out Armer sent Miss Mackie messages declaring his love for her, but these became more abusive in the run-up to the attack, said Mr Storrie. When he was interviewed by police, Armer denied attacking Miss Mackie.He said she had been rolling a cigarette while he left her to go to the toilet and was already alight when he came out. However, Mr Storrie said an identical bottle of white spirit to the one found on the sofa at Miss Mackie’s flat was found at Armer’s home in Kendal. DNA found on the bottle in her flat matched samples from Armer, and white spirit was found on his trainers and clothes, he said. The trial is expected to last into next week.

Determined: Roads minister Mike Penning has vowed the motorway will reopen on schedule . Fears that the M4 fiasco may continue beyond Thursday were sparked today as the minister responsible insisted that meeting the deadline was only a ‘hope’ and not a certainty. Concerns rose as Roads Minister Mike Penning  said the key section of the M4 flyover in west London may have cracked as a result of earlier repair work at the site - on a key Olympic route into the capital. But he backtracked on suggestions by the Government’s own Highways Agency that the Thursday deadline to finish the work and end the chaos would be met, venturing only that this was ‘highly possible’ but also ‘very difficult'. Transport department officials also sought to put the brakes on suggestions that the repairs would definitely be finished as promised by Thursday, ending five days of chaos affecting more than half a million motorists. A spokesman said: ’We can’t absolutely guarantee it. The best estimate is that the road will open on Thursday.’ On a visit to the stricken motorway, which is shut for six miles between junctions two and three, Mr Penning said: ‘The crack that caused the shut wasn’t there before.’ He said it was a ‘brand new crack, possibly due to the work we were doing.’ The Boston Manor viaduct was closed between junctions one and three, from Chiswick to Feltham, on Thursday night after the cracks in the steel supports were discovered. A ‘severe’ alert for congestion remains in place. The closure of the key M4 section . between junctions 2 and 3 has led to knock-on congestion on other . gridlocked roads as far as the A3 turn-off into Putney in south-west . London, where frustrated commuters faced waits of up to an hour. The M4 route is a major road link from London to the West Country and Wales, as well as a heavily-used commuter route. London Mayor Boris Johnson said it was vital the repairs were completed 'as speedily as possible'. Frustrating: The gridlock is causing road misery for 165,000 drivers every day . Repair job: A group of road workers get to work on fixing the cracked section of the motorway in West London . Mr Penning said today: ‘Last Thursday . evening they found a crack in one of the areas where they were already . working that wasn’t there the last time they looked. They checked it . again and it was growing because the traffic was coming on top.' He said it would be a ‘catastrophic . failure’ if the bridge were left broken and engineers wanted to fix it . ‘as soon as possible’. He said: ‘I'm hoping they will start . work on that this afternoon, plating it together, and as predicted right . at the start we hope to have it open on Thursday morning.’ Furious commuters stuck in traffic on the M4 have found one way to fill their time - tweeting about it. But is anyone listening? Here's what they are saying: . Pressed again, he refused to give any . guarantees that the road would reopen on Thursday, as the Highways . Agency predicted today and yesterday. He said: ‘That’s what we’d like to do, it’s highly possible.’ Derek Turner, the agency’s director . of delivery and development said the new crack was a two-and-a-half . inch-deep gash in the welded supports. He said: 'The crack wasn’t there before and was growing, which caused a hiccup in the repair process.' The bridge is supported by 10ft-wide . concrete pillars and underpinned by a lattice of steel girders. Workmen . are grinding down the cracks and filling them with reinforcement plates. The Highways Agency said it has inspected 1,000 cracks, of which 64 needed repair and most have been completed. However, even if the road reopens on . Thursday, there will be only four days to ensure the flyover is safe . before the Games lane opens on Monday. The M4 is expected to be one of the . busiest routes during the Games because it links the city and Olympic . Park in Stratford with Heathrow. Professor Stephen Glaister, director . of the RAC Foundation, said: ‘After the queues at Heathrow, now there’s . disruption on the M4. Welcome to Britain. 'The Highways Agency says a crack has . been found at a ""sensitive location"". Too right it has - on the main . route in and out of the capital for international visitors. 'This raises big question marks about our ability to look after what we already have, let alone provide new infrastructure.' Cracks: . White paint marks the cracks in the elevated section of the Boston . Manor Viaduct flyover which need fixing before the Olympics starts. The . cracks were first spotted four months ago . Jam: Traffic filters off the M4 approaching the closed section at the weekend. While part of it has now re-opened, one section is expected to remain shut for another three days . The M4 chaos is costing road users . tens of thousands a day in missed appointments, late deliveries, taxi . hire and extra fuel, according to the AA. Around 825,000 drivers will be affected over the five days in which the motorway linking Heathrow and Central London is being shut. Labour . is now demanding answers from ministers on the impact of cuts to road . maintenance budgets, which could be the reason for delaying improvement . works until they became crucial. The party has also raised questions over the readiness of contingency plans for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. John . Woodcock MP, Labour’s Shadow Transport Minister, said: 'It is . astonishing that with less than twenty days to go before the Olympic . Opening Ceremony, a key part of the M4 to Heathrow Airport will be shut . for several days. 'The . Highways Agency has known about issues with the viaduct for at least . four months, so motorway users will be asking why there has been a . panicked closure of the road weeks before the Games. 'Ministers . need to confirm that there are contingency plans in place, so that . another failure of the M4 would not jeopardise the Games. The Tory-led . Government also needs to urgently review the impact of its £435m cuts to . road maintenance budgets and whether they have contributed to this . mess.' Empty: This stretch of the M4 near London from the West is still completely closed for emergency maintenance . Stuck: The Great West Road (A4) is a key diversion route but was at a virtual standstill yesterday . Business leaders spoke of their anger . yesterday after it was revealed that the problems are set to last at . least five days, despite the fissures between junctions 1 and 3 being . discovered in March. The Institute of Directors said the . closure would be ‘economically damaging’, while the boss of Britain’s . biggest private hire taxi company called the closure ‘disastrous’ and a . ‘failure of investment in the road network’. It is the latest road closure on the . vital route from Heathrow – along which about 80 per cent of traffic to . the Olympics is expected to travel. At . Christmas, the A4 – which links to the M4 – was closed after cracks . were discovered in the Hammersmith flyover. It didn’t fully reopen for . five months. It would be a PR disaster for London 2012 organisers if the . M4 restrictions were still in place when the Games begin in three . weeks. The road has been reopened between junction 1 and 2 to relieve the pressure on Chiswick roundabout. Congestion . has spread as far afield as the M3, A4, M40, and even A3 in Surrey as . drivers heeded the Agency's warning to find 'alternative routes' into . the capital. Jam: Even an Olympic official's car is caught in the jam which is affecting thousands of commuters . Repairs have begun on the M4 elevated section in west London after cracks were found in the bridge section . Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors, was one of the motorists held up in jams caused by the closure. He . said: ‘It is fortunate that at least this was spotted before any . accident occurred, but it will still be economically damaging. ‘Closing the M4 so soon after the . Hammersmith flyover will come as a blow to many. The motorways are major . arteries for the nation’s businesses, transporting people to work and . goods to customers. ‘This . infrastructure is crucial to economic success, and having two major road . closures in a few months simply isn’t good enough.’ John . Griffin, boss of Addison Lee, London’s largest private taxi firm, said . yesterday: ‘This is yet another disaster for the roads network, and . highlights the lack of investment in key infrastructure. ‘This wholly preventable disaster could not come at a worst time – a few days before the Olympics.’ Mr Watters said the incident showed motorway structures across Britain were ‘showing their age’. He said: ‘It’s a close shave, the . timing is shocking with the Olympics so close. I expect the Highways . Agency are quite nervous about it. We just hope it is fixed by Thursday, . because it is the most vital artery.’ Blocked: The closure is part of continuing work being carried out to the Boston Manor Viaduct, just west of junction 2 . The new secondary crack causing the current crisis is part of a £4million repair project at the Boston Manor Viaduct. A Highways Agency spokesman said: ‘We are putting all our efforts into completing the repairs by Thursday. ‘Drivers heading into London are still advised to seek alternative routes via the M3 and M40 and are advised to plan for and leave extra time for their journeys.’ Diversion routes via the A4/A312 were registering delays of 20 minutes in both directions. The Agency added :’We are aware that congestion has also increased on London's roads. While we do not have access to data for those routes not on our network, we continue to liaise with Transport for London and the relevant local authorities and will make whatever changes are needed to help keep traffic moving in and out of London. ‘We are continuing to monitor the traffic situation and will review our plans if necessary.’ Into the city: The M4, part of the Olympic Route Network, will be vital for transporting visitors into London .

The six dead in the avalanche were said to have been in a group of 20 climbers when they were caught in the snow slide . At the scene: The climbing route where emergency crews focused their searches is said to be one of the most dangerous in Europe . The 28 climbers, who had split into . two groups, had spent Wednesday evening sleeping at Cosmiques Refuge, a . climbers’ hut at 11,800ft. They left the hut at 1.30am and began their ascent in temperatures of minus 5C (23F). When they left there were no weather . reports warning of avalanche risks, officials say. However gusts of wind . of up to 43mph may have created huge walls of snow, known as wind . slabs, which are extremely dangerous when they collapse. The group were trying to climb up a . steep snow-covered ridge on the north face of Mont Maudit at 13,120ft . when the avalanche struck. One of the injured climbers called the . emergency services on his mobile phone at 5.25am. Another local guide said that some of . the injured were dug out of the snow ‘very quickly’ by the first rescue . teams on the scene. One of the first to arrive was a . British guide Victor Saunders and his doctor client. They had left two . hours later than the avalanched party after the guide expressed concerns . about the weather. They gave first aid to the survivors and alerted the . rescue services.

Perilous: The Mont Blanc route, with Mont Maudit to the right, is one particularly popular with tourist climbers (file picture) Rescue: A helicopter from the Securite Civile (emergency services) flies over the Mont Blanc massif as investigators look for those stranded in the avalanche . More than 50 mountain rescuers and . police using teams of dogs and heat-seeking devices spent the day . searching the snow in an attempt to find any bodies buried. Teams of . rescuers from across the border in Italy joined the search. The Mont Blanc massif, although hugely popular with tourists, is an extremely dangerous climbing area which takes over 100 lives every year. The route has some of the most easily accessible mountains in the world, but has hidden perils due to its changeable climate. Unprecedented storms, as well as falling blocks and lightning strikes, all contribute to the dangers of the mountain range. In August 2008 eight climbers – three Swiss, one German, and four Austrian - died in a similar accident on the nearby Mont Blanc du Tacul. And a year earlier there was an even more catastrophic death toll, as nearly 30 were killed on Mont Blanc and its satellite peaks in July 2007. More recently, a Norwegian cross-country skier died in April after being caught up in an avalanche on Mont Blanc, only about a month after a Canadian skier died after plunging into a 20-metre (65-foot) crevice on the mountain. The latest tragedy on Mont Maudit - literally meaning 'Cursed Mountain' - is the biggest disaster to happen in the French Alps in a decade. Last night members of the close-knit climbing community were paying their respects to Mr Payne, 55, and the other climbers. Dave Turnbull, chief executive of the . British Mountaineering Club, said Mr Payne was a former BMC general . secretary and president of the British Mountain Guides. ‘Roger was one of the UK’s most . enthusiastic and respected climbers with a track record of Alpine and . Himalayan mountaineering stretching back to the 1980s,’ he said. ‘Our . thoughts are with Roger’s friends and family, in particular his wife . Julie-Ann.’ John Cousins, from the British Mountain Guides Association, . said: ‘He was such an energetic character. He really was a truly . remarkable and amazing individual.’ Mr Payne, originally from Hammersmith in West London, was an expert guide with an intimate knowledge of the Alpine range. The climber, who lived in Leysin, . Switzerland, with his wife, also a mountaineer, had been on 20 . expeditions to some of the world’s highest and most challenging peaks. His avalanche training programme is used to teach hundreds of students each year. Last night members of the British Foreign Office arrived in Chamonix to offer assistance. The two British climbers who escaped . had taken a different route, said Sir Peter Ricketts, the British . Ambassador to France, who last night arrived in Chamonix to offer . assistance. A local official added: ‘They were part of the original . party but for some reason they changed their minds. They must have had . some premonition.’ Recovery: Five Britons are said to be among those still missing from the group of 28 climbers, as helicopters rushed to the scene .

Survivors of the avalanche in which three Britons died have described their terror as they were thrown 800ft down the mountain by the overwhelming force. One said it had ‘felt like being in a washing machine’. The avalanche struck in the French Alps as 28 climbers roped together in small groups made their way up the 14,649ft Mont Maudit – which translates as ‘cursed peak’ – in the dark. Nine were swept to their deaths by a block of snow 60ft high and 500ft wide in the early hours of Thursday. Scroll down for video . Survivors: Daniel Rosseto (left), an independent mountain guide, and his client Thomas Wybro, from Denmark, survived the avalanch and told of being also thrown down Mont Maudit . The Britons who died were close friends John Taylor, 48, and Steve Barber, 47, who lived on the same street in the village of Poppleton, near York, and their guide, 55-year-old Roger Payne.Speaking from his hospital bed yesterday, survivor Daniel Rossetto, 63, a French mountain guide with 30 years’ experience, said: ‘I’ve never seen anything like this before. ‘I felt the snow fall down on me. We tried to resist but it pushed all the way down the slope, 250 metres (800ft).’ Mr Rossetto had set out from a mountain refuge with two Danish clients in the darkness, using torches. They were at 13,100ft following a particularly difficult route that would ultimately have taken them to the summit of Mont Blanc. Roped together, the trio suddenly became trapped under masses of snow. Tragedy: Roger Payne, pictured with wife Julie-Ann Clyma, died in the avalanche . Mr Rossetto recalled: ‘At each shock, we wonder if it will get worse. It’s as if I was in a washing machine. ‘We were on the edge of the avalanche, it was our chance, while the other climbers were caught under masses of snow. The mountain is unforgiving.’ Despite suffering a dislocated shoulder, he managed to claw his way out of the snow after he was thrown down the face of Mount Maudit. He was the first to raise the alarm by calling the mountain rescue services from his mobile phone at 5.20am. Lying in another bed at the hospital in the nearby town of Sallanches, one of his clients, Thomas Dybro, 30, from Copenhagen, told how survivors dug with their hands to rescue other victims, some with broken legs. And he described the grim task of pulling the dead out of the snow. ‘It was horrible,’ he said. ‘We were digging for one and a half hours. The snow and ice was really hard.’ Despite Mr Rossetto’s injuries he and Mr Dybro were able to walk off the mountain assisted by their rescuers. Killed: Steve Barber, left, and John Taylor, who both died in the avalanche, were lifelong best friends who lived on the same street in Upper Poppleton, Yorkshire . Tragedy: Experienced climber Roger Payne was . killed by the avalanche in the Alps. On the right, he is pictured during . a climb in the Himalayas . The devastated families of the three Britons said yesterday that they had died doing what they loved.Mr Taylor and Mr Barber, whose daughters went to the same primary school, had embarked on the climb to raise money for St Leonard’s Hospice in York and Macmillan Cancer Support. Their guide, Mr Payne was one of the UK’s most respected climbers and a former general secretary of the British Mountaineering Council. His tearful 91-year-old mother Nellie Payne, of Hammersmith, West London, said: ‘I am devastated. My children are my life. It is heart-breaking not to be able to see my son any more.’ Mr Payne, who had developed an avalanche training programme, met his future wife, Julie-Ann Clymer, a climbing instructor from New Zealand, at the top of a mountain in South America. They married in 1983 and lived in a chalet in Leysin, Switzerland. Mrs Payne said the pair, who had no children, were ‘inseparable’ and travelled the world together climbing some of the most dangerous and breath-taking peaks. ‘They were made for each other,’ she said. ‘They had a lovely life. Now Julie is all by herself and I don’t know what she will do.’ Miss Clymer arrived in Chamonix, the French town near Mont Blanc, yesterday afternoon from Switzerland to identify her husband.

He had so much experience and would never take people higher than was safe. ‘He was charismatic, out-going, friendly, happy-go-lucky. Our only comfort is that he died doing what he loved.’ Fellow victim Mr Barber, an accountant, had lived in Poppleton for most of his life and his parents ran the village post office before they retired. Donna Rogers, his long-term partner, with whom he has a daughter, Francesca, ten, said: ‘The family and I are all devastated at the loss of Steve and his close friend John. ‘Steve always wanted to climb Mont Blanc, an ambition that this trip was to fulfil. ‘He . had been training hard and had successfully completed several . challenging climbs in Europe and in the UK prior to this trip.’ Finance . director Mr Taylor took up mountaineering in 1998 and had climbed Mont . Blanc twice before. His wife Karine, with whom he had two daughters, . Emma, ten, and Louise, eight, said she was ‘truly devastated’. Three Germans, two Spaniards and a Swiss climber were also killed in the avalanche, and 14 people were injured.

Two prisoners who killed and disembowelled a fellow inmate so they could eat his liver have been sentenced to life imprisonment today. Michael Parr and Nathan Mann were told by the judge they'd spend the rest of their lives behind bars after they were sentenced for the gruesome death of Mitchell Harrison. Harrison, 23 was serving an indefinite sentence for raping a 13-year-old girl at Durham’s Frankland Prison when he was killed last October. Sentenced to die in prison: Michael Parr, left, and Nathan Mann, right, were told by the judge they may never be released . Michael Parr, 33, pleaded guilty to murder while fellow inmate Nathan Mann pleaded guilty to manslaughter due to diminished responsibility. Sentencing at Newcastle Crown Court, Mr Justice Openshaw said: 'I consider this to be a murder of peculiar and unusual brutality. 'Because of the risk these prisoners pose I cannot envisage the circumstances where either of them are ever released. 'They will face the fact that they may well end their lives in prison.' During sentencing, Mann was described as a 'classic cold, callous and homicidal psycopath'. It was heard he had harboured fantasies about killing and of cannibalism, and along with Parr had planned to live out their twisted urges together. Paedophile Mitchell Harrison, who was killed by fellow Frankland Prison inmates Michael Parr and Nathan Mann during an horrific attack last year . The . pair had talked about consuming their victim’s liver and had . deliberately targeted Harrison, who was at the time serving at least . four-and-a-half years for the rape which happened in Kendal, Cumbria, . because they believed he was arrogant. On the morning of October 1 2011, Parr and Mann had lured Harrison’s into Mann’s cell before launching the brutal attack. Mann attempted to strangle him and then stabbed him in the eye with a biro pen, before slashing his neck with a weapon made from plastic cutlery and razor blades. As Mann inflicted the gruesome attack, it was heard how Parr held the victim down by his legs. Harrison’s abdomen was then cut open exposing his small intestine, but despite their initial plans to remove the victim’s liver, it was heard that the defendants were 'unable to go through with it'. There was no suggestion that the deceased’s liver had been removed, the court heard. Robert QC, prosecuting, told the court: 'Officers went to check the cell and found the deceased lying on the bed. 'Nathan Mann reported that they had just killed someone. 'The defendant said he had wanted to kill someone and that they did not really like the victim and he had appeared arrogant. 'There was a large open wound to the left side of the deceased’s neck. 'His abdomen was exposed, his small intestine was protruded.' Both men were already serving life sentences at Frankland prisons. Mann was serving a life sentence with a minimum of 24 years for the vicious murder of two woman aged 72 and 56, at a nursing home in Leicestershire, in 2010 . Parr was serving a life sentence in 2003 for the attempted murder of a patient in a psychiatric hospital. In interviews with police after the attack, both said they had harboured fantasies about killing, while Parr said he was 'excited' that he found someone in Mann with whom he shared a common interest. Mr Smith QC told the court that prior to Harrison’s death, Mann had warned prison staff that he would kill someone, but that these had been dismissed as threats. A note written by Mann was also discovered after the attack, which outlined his reasoning for wanting to kill someone. The two killers and their victim were inmates at Frankland Prison, in Durham . Mr Smith QC said: 'The investigation into the death revealed Nathan Mann had written a note. 'He had described he did not have the guts to kill himself but did have the guts to kill someone else. 'He could not handle the fact that he had killed two vulnerable people. 'He said in the note he could not handle the voices in his head and the belief that someone was going to kill him. 'He said killing someone was the only way he thought he would be segregated from everything.' Similarly before the incident, Parr had told a psychiatric nurse that he had fantasies of chopping off fellow prisoners’ heads and cutting open their stomachs. During the sentence, a doctor’s report on Mann was read out, which described him as possessing compulsive homicidal urges. It also referred to the defendant as a “classic cold, callous and homicidal psychopath.” In sentencing both, Mr Justice Openshaw said it was clear both had set out to commit the attack together. He added: 'The victim was targeted, it was their intention to cut him open and then to eat his liver.'In fact they desisted but not until they had cut him open.' Parr was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum of 32 years. Mann was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum of 16 years on top of his current sentence.","Killers lured fellow prisoner to their cell and one held him down while the other attacked him .

One sorority sister was being sued by another after a confrontation over a boyfriend led to a vicious, bloody cat fight with the girls repeatedly punching each other in the head and tearing out hair, according to court documents. Kristin Saban, daughter of legendary University of Alabama football coach Nick Saban, was being sued for $10,000 by fellow Phi Mu sister Sarah Grimes, who claims the two attacked each other over a Facebook post following a night of drinking games. The lawsuit was filed late last month in Tuscaloosa by Miss Grimes, who attends the $36,000-a-year University of Alabama with Miss Saban. The incident happened on August 28, 2010 after tit-for-tat bickering led to Kristen posting on Facebook: 'No one likes Sarah! Yayyyyy!'. Miss Grimes is alleged to have replied: 'Well if she touches me, I'll kill her.' Allegations: Kristen Saban, seen in both images, the daughter of University of Alabama football coach Nick Saban, is being sued by a sorority sister who claims the two got into a fight over a Facebook post . Sister, sister: The Phi Mu house at the University of Alabama; both girls pledged the sorority in 2009 . Pledges: Both girls had pledged the Alpha Zeta chapter of Phi Mu, the second oldest women's fraternity . The heated verbal exchange then erupted, with . Kristin shoving her sorority sister into a door and slamming her head, . according to court documents seen by Gawker. Sarah reacted, pushing back and saying: 'Don't touch me.' Kristen then repeatedly punched Sarah in the face as she screamed: 'I'm calling the cops!' Miss Saban kept a firm grip on Miss Grimes' hair as the two wrestled down the hallway. Kristen continued to rain blows on Sarah's face, despite attempts of fellow sorority students to separate the pair. In the end it took two girls to pull Kristen off Sarah, whose nose was now streaming with blood. Grimes suffered numerous injuries that an emergency room doctor said . could have killed her, the lawsuit claimed. The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of at least $10,000 but doesn't mention the football coach Saban or his wife Terry. An attorney for Kristen Saban filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit on Thursday, blaming the altercation on Grimes and claiming the coach's daughter acted only in self-defence. Kristen Saban's motion said she didn't cause any of Grimes' injuries. A representative of the coach declined comment. A lawyer for Grimes, Stephen Strickland, called the lawsuit 'a private matter'. 'It's not about Nick Saban, it's not about Miss Terry. It's about two individuals who used to be sorority sisters and friends,' Strickland said. Both women remain students at the University of Alabama, he added. The lawsuit claimed Grimes and Kristen Saban were playing a drinking game called 'Power Hour' - where students drink at the end of every song on YouTube - with friends on August 28, 2010. Higher education: Both girls attend the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa . Around midnight they went to a . Tuscaloosa bar called Rounders, where Kristen became enraged because an . on-off boyfriend was not paying her enough attention, according to the . suit. The group went to a house after last call at the bar and Kristen Saban became emotional, the suit said. While lying on the floor with two . other young women the coach's daughter began saying 'how everyone did . not understand ''how it was'' for her ... ,' the complaint noted. 'After Kristen refused to get off the floor after several people had tried to help her, Sarah looked over at Kristen and said, ''Kristen, please just shut up. We're all sick and tired of hearing it,""' according to the suit. Sarah claims the altercation began when she told Kristen: 'That's fine, but we're done, you're crazy.' Grimes contends the other woman punched her repeatedly in the head, grabbed her neck and pulled her hair, leaving her bloody, swollen and bruised. Friends took Grimes to the emergency room at DCH Regional Medical Center, which is adjacent to the university campus. There, both city and university police and the university's dean of students showed up in response to an assault call. Crimson pride: Kristen's father is head coach Nick Saban of the Alabama Crimson Tide; he is pictured in January of this year . Celebration: Saban celebrates with the trophy after defeating Louisiana State University Tigers in the 2012 Allstate BCS National Championship Game earlier this year . Tuscaloosa police Sgt. Brent Blankley said officers went to the hospital and filled out a report. 'The victim stated she did not want to prosecute in the case and the case was closed,' he said, declining further comment. University spokeswoman Cathy Andreen said Kristen Saban remains a student but declined further comment, citing privacy rules. The suit said Grimes was hurt so badly she suffered a concussion, an increase in migraine headaches, had nasal surgery and required psychological help. 'As a result of the beating and the head injuries Sarah Grimes sustained by Kristen Saban, Sarah has had repeated night terrors, anxiety, physical trembling, fears of dying from brain injuries, trouble sleeping, and intrusive recollections of the event,' the lawsuit said. Kristen Saban's lawyer argued that Grimes was responsible for her own injuries. The dismissal motion also said insurance covered Grimes' medical costs, so Kristen Saban shouldn't have to pay. Kristen Saban pleaded guilty to an unspecified offense before the university's judicial board but was not prosecuted criminally, according to the suit. It said she was required to undergo psychological screening and take an anger management class.

Not condemned: John Riccardi, who is convicted of killing rock guitarist Dave Navarro's mother nearly 30 years ago, will skip the death penalty because of a supreme court ruling . The California Supreme Court tossed out the death sentence of a man convicted of murdering rock guitarist Dave Navarro's mother and her friend nearly 30 years ago - a ruling that could affect the cases of Scott Peterson and other death row inmates. The unanimous court today said the trial judge presiding over the trial of John Riccardi improperly dismissed a prospective juror because of her conflicting written responses in a questionnaire asking her views of the death penalty. The court said the judge was required to delve deeper into the juror's death penalty views and determine if she could impose the death sentence is she believed prosecutors proved their case. Peterson and a few other California death row inmates are appealing on similar grounds. Peterson was convicted of killing his wife Laci, who was eight months pregnant with their son, and dumping her body in San Francisco Bay on Christmas Eve 2002. Investigators believe Peterson either strangled or suffocated his wife. Peterson has always maintained his innocence and claims in his appeal filed earlier this month that the trial judge presiding over his 2004 trial wrongly dismissed 13 jurors who said they opposed the death penalty but could follow the law and impose it if warranted. In 1984, a narrowly divided U.S. Supreme Court ruled that reversal of the death penalty is automatic when potential jurors are dismissed because of their written answers to questions about their views on capital punishment. Sad past: Connie Navarro was killed nearly 30 years ago; her son, David Navarro, pictured at an event this February, is a guitarist for rock band Jane's Addiction . Change of fate: Scott Peterson, left, was convicted of killing his wife Laci, right, who was eight months pregnant with their son, and dumping her body in San Francisco Bay on Christmas Eve 2002; the ruling could change his death sentence . Peterson's attorney Cliff Gardner argued in his appeal that the mistake occurred in the Peterson trial and may be the basis of appeals of a few other death row inmates. The last California execution occurred in 2006. Lawsuits in federal and state courts have forced a temporary halt to executions. In its ruling Monday, the state high court upheld Riccardi's murder conviction. Once a noted body builder, he was convicted of killing former girlfriend Connie Navarro in a jealous rage. Her friend Sue Jory also was killed. Navarro's son played guitar for the band 'Jane's Addiction.' It's now up the California attorney general to determine if another penalty phase will be held or if Riccardi is taken off death row and sentenced to life in prison. State of mind: The State of California's supreme court in San Francisco . Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye said that ruling 'compels the reversal of the penalty phase without any inquiry as to whether the error actually' led to an unfair trial. The chief justice wrote separately to urge the U.S. Supreme Court to reconsider the automatic reversal in such cases. The juror in question, identified only by the initials 'N.K.' in the ruling, wrote on the questionnaire that she supported California's reinstatement of the death penalty and stated that it is not used enough. But later in the questionnaire, the juror gave answers that suggest she opposes capital punishment.'I'm afraid I could not feel right in imposing the death penalty on someone even though I feel it is nessasary (sic) under some circumstances,' N.K. wrote. Cantil-Sakauye wrote that the trial court judge should have questioned her more instead of dismissing her as he did. The chief justice said the juror's conflicting answers meant either she 'feared that actually being on a death jury would be difficult or uncomfortable, or she was advising the court that she could not impose a decision of death, even if the evidence warranted its application. From the questionnaire alone, we cannot possibly determine which scenario prompted her answers.' Riccardi was arrested in Houston eight years after the killings when 'America's Most Wanted' aired a segment on the 1983 crime. A tipster recognized him and alerted authorities.","John Riccardi convicted of killing Connie Navarro nearly 30 years ago .

His 19-year old daughter, awarded best newcomer at this year's National Television Awards, sat in the public gallery with her mother and other sister as he received his sentence at the Old Bailey today. Jossa, pretended his wife had worked for the council and paid more than £42,000 into their account when no such work had ever been done. He also fiddled with invoices from . recruitment firm Adecco, creating fake ones and processing genuine ones . that had yet to be signed off following its work for the council - . directing more than £448,000 into his pocket. The . court heard that he invested most of the money into investment schemes . but fell victim to boiler rooms scams that promised high returns but . ended up losing all of it. When Enfield council launched a court action against him only £25,000 was recovered. Jossa was made redundant in 2009, but is alleged to have stolen the money between 2006 and 2010. Despite the massive fraud he collected over £170,000 in redundancy. Sentencing . Judge Nicholas Cooke QC said: ‘How on earth a person with a shred of . decency thinks he's entitled to it when he steals half-a-million from . his employers that shows criminally distorted thinking. Jailed: John Jossa was sentenced to four years imprisonment at the Old Bailey today after siphoning off money from Enfield council into his own account . On the subject of Mr Jossa, of Bexley, becoming a victim to fraud himself, he added: ‘In addition to being fully dishonest, he's a fool.’ Jossa pleaded guilty to one count of obtaining money by deception and two counts of fraud at an earlier hearing. Judge Cooke said: ‘I have to sentence you for three offences of dishonesty by a fairly sophisticated fraud. Miss Jossa was snapped enjoying herself at the premiere of Magic Mike last night on the evening before her father appeared in court . ‘You . have taken £491,000 odd of funds of no doubt hard-pressed local . authority. Knowing that you had done that, you accepted another £170,000 . odd by way of payment on termination of your employment at that same . local authority. ‘The vast . majority of all that money is now gone. All that court proceedings . brought by the London Borough of Enfield has been able to recoup as . about £25,000 described as a drop in the ocean. ‘The prospect of further recovery on behalf of local residents is bleak. ‘You . continue to receive a local authority pension. How long that may . continue and whether anything can be done about that is not a matter for . me.’ Judge Cooke said Mr Jossa was a man focused on greed and added that Mr Jossa’s senior position within the council represented ‘a gross breach of trust’. ‘Your offending will have real consequences to local residents in terms of reduced services or a decline in payments for those that live in the area. ‘You have embarrassed the vast majority of hard working, and compared to your salary, lowly paid local government employees. ‘It was not your money, it was local residents money.’ Earlier his defence barrister Avtar Bhatoa said the ‘genesis of this offending goes back to April 2006’ when his client's ‘salary was failing to service his debts.’","John Jossa, father of EastEnders actress Jaqueline Jossa stole money from Enfield council .
