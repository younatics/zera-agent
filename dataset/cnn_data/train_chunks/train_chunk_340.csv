"(CNN) -- Wrestling has been reinstated to the program for the 2020 Games in Tokyo after a vote Sunday by members of the International Olympic Committee in Buenos Aires. Wrestling won on the first round of voting by gaining 49 of the 95 votes cast. It was competing with the joint bid of baseball/softball and squash to win the final spot on the roster of sports for 2020, as the Summer Games returns to Asia after the Beijing Games of 2008. Baseball/softball claimed 24 votes and squash received 22. The result means wrestling, a sport which dates back to the ancient Olympics over 3,000 years ago, is assured of taking its place in both Tokyo in 2020 and the 2024 Summer Olympics. In February, wrestling, which has appeared in all the modern Games dating back to Athens in 1896, was cut from the 2020 program after the IOC executive board made an assessment of the performance of all 26 sports in the 2012 London Olympics. But in May, with its world governing body FILA (International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles), under the new leadership of Serbian Nenad Lalovic, wrestling was given the chance to compete with baseball/softball and squash to extend its inclusion past the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Lalovic told IOC members as he made his presentation Sunday: ""Today is the most important day in the 3,000-year history of our sport."" Later, he reflected on the reasons why wresting had preserved its place on the program when all had appeared lost. ""This crisis gave us the strength to change and we finally found we can change,"" he told reporters. ""Wrestling has become a modernized sport ready to compete with other sports. ""We have updated it to make it more spectacular and more watchable and the rules understandable,"" Lalovic added. Questioned about allegations of corruption, which have also dogged wrestling, Lalovic pointed to changes in FILA's governance structure. ""There is no real evidence of it, but there is always suspicions, the only way to tackle this is by a modern and democratic constitution."" The baseball/softball bid had in its presentation team Antonio Castro, the son of the Cuban leader Fidel Castro, but failed to win back its status after being voted off the Games program starting with the 2012 Games in London. Squash has long fought for Olympic status and Narayana Ramachandaran, president of its world federation, described the decision as ""heartbreaking"" after a 10-year long campaign. Earlier Sunday, the IOC voted to retain the 25 sports already on its program. Golf and Rugby Sevens had already been added to the 2016 and 2020 Games after an earlier vote in 2009. Wrestling's reinstatement will take the total number of sports being contested to 28 in 2020.","Wrestling back on Olympic program for 2020 Games in Tokyo .

"(CNN) -- We've all heard the dictum: Don't text and drive. Now a New Jersey state appeals court has an addendum: Don't knowingly text a driver -- or you could be held liable if he causes a crash. Kyle Best was behind the wheel of his pickup in September 2009 driving down a rural highway when Shannon Colonna sent him a text. The two were teens at the time. He was 18; she was 17, and they were dating. They sent each other 62 texts that day, according to court documents. In the opposing lane of traffic, David Kubert was cruising along on a big, blue touring motorcycle with his wife, Linda, along for the ride. They approached Best at exactly the wrong time. Can you really be liable for texting a driver? The texts . A court summary of the times of texts and calls to and from Best's cell phone reflect what happened next: . The teens were having a text chat, volleying each other messages every few moments. Seventeen seconds after Best sent a text, he was calling a 911 operator. His truck had drifted across the double center line and hit the Kuberts head-on. The scene Best described to the emergency operator was most certainly gruesome. ""The collision severed, or nearly severed David's left leg. It shattered Linda's left leg, leaving her fractured thighbone protruding out of the skin as she lay injured in the road,"" the court document said. Best hung up. Colonna texted him two more times. The court did not publish the contents of their messages. Film legend Herzog takes on texting and driving . The lawsuit . The Kuberts both lost their legs. They sued. But they didn't just go after Best. They included Colonna in the lawsuit. In their minds, she was distracting him and was also responsible for their pain and loss. They settled with Best and lost against Colonna, but they appealed that decision. The plaintiffs' attorney, Stephen Weinstein, argued that the text sender was electronically in the car with the driver receiving the text and should be treated like someone sitting next to him willfully causing a distraction, legal analyst Marc Saperstein told CNN affiliate WPIX-TV. The argument seemed to work. The ruling . On Tuesday, three appeals court judges agreed with it -- in principle. They ruled that if the sender of text messages knows that the recipient is driving and texting at the same time, a court may hold the sender responsible for distraction and hold him or her liable for the accident. ""We hold that the sender of a text message can potentially be liable if an accident is caused by texting, but only if the sender knew or had special reason to know that the recipient would view the text while driving and thus be distracted,"" the court said. Explainer: Can you really be liable for texting a driver? But the judges let Colonna off the hook. She had a habit of sending more than 100 texts a day and was oblivious to whether recipients were driving or not. ""I'm a young teenager. That's what we do,"" she said in her deposition before the original trial. Since she was unaware that Best was texting while driving, she bore no responsibility, the court decided. ""In this appeal, we must also decide whether plaintiffs have shown sufficient evidence to defeat summary judgment in favor of the remote texter. We conclude they have not,"" it said. Survey: Adults text more than teens while driving . The reaction . During the trial, Colonna, now 21, found it ""weird"" that the plaintiffs tried to nail down whether she knew Best was texting behind the wheel, the court document said. The judges' decision has elicited a similar response from the state's governor, Chris Christie. The driver is ultimately responsible, he said. Not someone sending him a text. ""You have the obligation to keep your eyes on the road, your hands on the wheel and pay attention to what you're doing,"" he told radio station New Jersey 101.5. Other New Jerseyites agreed. ""That's completely absurd, just because you know you're driving doesn't mean, it really doesn't mean they know you're looking at it,"" Joe Applegate told WPIX. ""Even talking to the driver can distract them, so they are going to arrest for someone who simply talked to someone who is driving?"" Louise McKellip asked. The future . New Jersey has been cracking down hard on texting and driving in recent years, implementing new laws and regulations that treat it in a similar manner as drunken driving if it involves an injury accident. The state passed a law last year based on the fate of the Kuberts and others who had been killed or maimed by texting motorists. The ""Kulesh, Kubert and Bolish's Law"" makes distracted driving a crime if the driver causes an accident. Fines for bodily injury run as high as $150,000, and the driver can go to jail for up to 10 years. And new legislation proposed by state Sen. James Holzapfel would let police thumb through cellphones if they have ""reasonable grounds"" to believe the driver was talking or texting when the wreck occurred. The bill has set off alarm bells with the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey. Judge rules using smartphone maps while driving illegal .

"(CNN) -- About 300 teenagers are realizing they picked the wrong place to throw a wild party after breaking into a former NFL player's second home and causing more than $20,000 in damage. Brian Holloway, a former offensive tackle for the New England Patriots, was in Tampa, Florida, over Labor Day weekend when his son told him he was receiving tweets about a party at their home in Stephentown, New York, Holloway said. ""I thought it was a joke,"" he told CNN on Thursday. But Holloway soon realized there was an underage party at his home. ""I'm looking at these tweets and they're saying, 'I'm partying with the NFL.' 'I've never seen so much alcohol in my life', 'I can't wake her up', 'Oh we're being busted. We gotta hide. Get rid of all the drugs.' "" he said. Holloway contacted police, but by the time they arrived, the damage was done. The partygoers broke and stole multiple items, put holes through walls and spray-painted graffiti throughout the home. ""We had learned that they had broken in,"" Holloway told CNN's Brooke Baldwin Thursday. ""They used a couple of different ways to enter the house. They broke and kicked in a couple windows. They came in through one back door. They took a ladder and came in through the window."" ""I blew past furious to what's important: How do we save these 300 lives that thought this was a good idea?"" Holloway said. He began a campaign to not only hold the teens responsible, but to also address the problem of teen alcohol and drug use. ""So I used the same technology they did to communicate to them and unveil this conversation that was going on,"" Holloway said. He compiled a list of the tweets and photos from the party to identify the teens, and he created a website, www.helpmesave300.com. ""We have 170 tweets with people and their pictures, so we know who was there just by doing security searches with the sheriffs,"" Holloway said. As a result of his work with law enforcement, he says that 200 partygoers have been identified and the last 100 will be in the next few days. ""We knew some of the kids there because they've been up to the house before,"" Holloway said recalling gatherings he's hosted at his home before. ""They just took it to another level."" Holloway says parents threatened him after he posted pictures of their children online in an attempt to hold them accountable. ""Parents are upset with me when their child was in my house ... taking drugs, using roofies and drinking, and they're going to be upset with me?"" he said in disbelief. This week, Holloway invited the teens to be accountable and help clean up his home in preparation for a military personnel picnic planned for this weekend that up to 1,000 people are expected to attend. Fifty volunteers showed up to clean up the home, but only one person who was there actually attended the party. ""Only one student showed up,"" Holloway said in disbelief. ""Is it a statement about us as a community? If you take our temperature as a community, we get a failing grade. How is there no accountability?"" Yvonne Keefe, spokeswoman for the Rensselaer County Sheriff's Office, says a ""large investigation"" is taking place, but no arrests have been made. ""We are working and interviewing, and once we have all the info we will proceed,"" Keefe said. ""When will we see a 15-year-old in a casket from drinking and driving?"" Holloway asked. ""Then we'll finally ask what could we have done, and that question will haunt us.""","Brian Holloway was in Florida when he heard about a wild party at his New York home .

"(CNN) -- Michel Platini has broken his silence over FIFA's refusal to publish the long-awaited report into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. ""As long as the regulations of the FIFA code of ethics regarding the actual investigation are respected, I support the publishing of the Garcia Report,"" the Frenchman told CNN Thursday. ""I have no issue with the findings and recommendations of the report being made available to the public."" FIFA president Sepp Blatter has stated that the report -- compiled by Michael Garcia, head of the world governing body's investigative chamber of the ethics committee -- will not be published because of fears over witness confidentiality. Hans-Joachim Eckert, head of FIFA's adjudicatory chamber of the ethics committee, is expected to reveal his decision on sanctions next year. American lawyer Garcia is among those who have urged FIFA to publish the report but Platini's statement of intent is the most significant yet -- he is the highest profile member of the football world to oppose Blatter's position. ""The president has been very calm about the whole issue, whether it's the investigation or process which led to the investigation,"" UEFA Chief of Press Pedro Pinto told CNN. ""After he met with Mr. Garcia earlier this year, the President said he liked speaking with him and that his team was objective, concrete and straight. ""He likes dealing with people who are like that."" Platini, who openly revealed he voted for Qatar to be awarded the 2022 World Cup, believes FIFA must become more transparent in their dealings. He did rule out challenging Blatter for the presidency next year. The 59-year-old made clear his feelings about FIFA during a speech in Monaco last August where he spoke of the need for the organization to be open and accountable. ""We all want a FIFA that functions better, that is more transparent, that shows more solidarity, and that football fans hold in higher esteem,"" he said. ""I will do everything I can, at my level, to contribute to this."" Platini's public support for the publication of the report follows views expressed by a number of Executive Committee members, who believe FIFA should disclose not just the results but also the findings. Sunil Gulati, the president of U.S. Soccer, has urged FIFA to publish the findings and recommendations of the report, as have FIFA vice-presidents Jim Boyce of Northern Ireland and Prince Ali bin al-Hussein from Jordan. Prince Ali, FIFA's Asian vice-president, took to Twitter last week to give his views on the matter, urging for more transparency. ""In the interest of full transparency, I believe it is important that the much-anticipated report on the ethics investigation that is crucial to ensuring good governance at Fifa is fully disclosed and open to the public,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""This will only help the football community move ahead in reforming our institutions in the best interest of the sport. ""The entire football family as well as its sponsors and those who follow the game worldwide have a full right to know the contents of the report in the spirit of complete openness."" Blatter's position has been boosted by FIFA's legal director Marco Villiger, who said that witness confidentiality could prove difficult to sustain if the report was published. ""The code of ethics is based on certain principles, one of which is confidentiality,"" Villiger told reporters. ""Cooperation between witnesses and the ethics committee is based on confidentiality, if not perhaps certain witnesses, whistleblowers or other parties might not cooperate to such an extent,"" he said, adding that 75 witnesses had been heard during Garcia's investigation.","Michel Platini wants Garcia report made public .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Furious anti-Japan protests erupted in Chinese cities Sunday after a Japanese group landed on an island that both countries say is theirs. Protesters toppled Japanese-made cars, burned Japanese flags, and shouted that the island is Chinese territory and that Japan should get out, according to the state-run China Daily newspaper. There were protests in Shenzhen, Shenyang, Hangzhou, Harbin and Qingdao, China Daily reported. In Guangzhou, demonstrators staged a loud sit-in in front of the Japanese consulate, it said. Chinese protesters carried Chinese flags and banners during a march in Hong Kong. The group of 10 Japanese landed on the island Sunday. They waved Japanese flags and draped one over a lighthouse. ""As a Japanese citizen, and as a local lawmaker, I went onto the island to show clearly that this is Japan's territory,"" Eiji Kousaka, a parliament representative from Tokyo, told the Reuters news agency after landing on the island. TIME: Maritime disputes not just about China . He said he ""had"" to go to the island after a group of Chinese nationals landed there Wednesday. Japan arrested 14 of them and deported them Friday. ""I can't just shut my eyes and go and just fish,"" Kousaka told Reuters. The island is part of an uninhabited chain in the East China Sea claimed by both countries. China calls them Diaoyu and Japan calls them Senkaku, and ownership of the islands would allow for exclusive oil, mineral, and fishing rights in surrounding waters. After Japan arrested the Chinese group Wednesday, there were anti-Japan demonstrations in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Beijing. China warned Japan not to allow Sunday's landing, urging it not to ""undermine China's territorial sovereignty,"" according to China's state-run Xinhua news agency. The islands have been the center of dispute for decades. Japanese nationalists traveled to the islands in 1990 and 1996. In 2010, tensions rose to a boiling point when a Chinese fishing trawler rammed into a Japan Coast Guard vessel on patrol in the islands' waters. Japan detained the crew members but later released them under Chinese diplomatic and trade pressure. The dispute boils down to where lines can be drawn in the ocean for commercial use. International law allows for a nation to claim exclusive economic rights to fish, oil and mineral reserves up to 200 nautical miles from the shore. One question hanging over territorial claims is whether the disputed islands are islands at all, according to maritime law. If they're not islands, then territorial claims don't apply. Both sides say they have a history of economic use of the islands. China points to a 1893 decree by Dowager Empress Cixi, giving the island to a Chinese medicine-maker for use in cultivating herbs. Japan points to 19th-century use on the island to collect seabird feathers and guano. Tokyo Gov. Shintaro Ishihara says a Japanese family claims to own four of the five disputed islands, and that it has documents showing the islands' Japanese ownership dating to 1890. The Wednesday incident coincided with the 67th anniversary of Japan's official World War II surrender. On the same day, two Japanese Cabinet ministers visited the controversial Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo, which honors Japan's war dead as well as war criminals. China and South Korea, given their respective wartime occupation and colonization by Japan, have condemned such visits. A commentary published by the Japan Times on Friday cited diplomatic experts in Japan as saying both nations would benefit from resolving the dispute quickly, with China facing a leadership change later in the year and Japan facing separate territorial fights with Seoul and Moscow. Adding to the regional tensions before the anniversary was South Korean President Lee Myung-bak's visit Tuesday to what the country calls Dokdo, a small group of islands in the Sea of Japan that Japan claims as Takeshima. The move prompted Japan to recall its ambassador to Seoul and warn South Korea that it will take the issue to the International Court of Justice -- a proposal rejected by Seoul. Japan's finance minister has also said he will cancel a trip to South Korea because of the dispute. Japan has long claimed the islets as its territory, but Seoul said all Korean territory was returned after the country won independence from colonial rule by Japan in 1945.

"Venice, Italy (CNN) -- Public transport in Venice is like an endless sightseeing tour, and not only for the amount of tourists on the central vaporetto routes. The waterfront architecture is truly spectacular, from Palladian churches to private palazzos. And now during the Biennale contemporary artworks and installations are scattered around the city. Venturing along the waterways leads to some unmissable exhibitions, where art and architecture blend into a beautiful dialogue. Baroque influence . Close to the Rialto market on the Canal Grande, an 18th century palazzo is home to Fondazione Prada, where all three floors are open to the public for the first time. During the Biennale it's hosting a show curated by Germano Celant, one of the leading figures of the 1960s anti-formal art movement Arte Povera. Celant has filled the rooms with a theatrical show. From 16th century musical instruments, clocks and mechanical curiosities to modern installation pieces involving performers, Art or Sound explores both formal and conceptual ideas relating to music. You can witness the craft of historic pieces as well as works by key avant-garde artists from Celant's previous collaborations, such as John Cage, Nam June Paik, Michelangelo Pistoletto and Jannis Kounellis. Their radical rethinking of art and the abstract condition of sound resonates throughout the exhibition. The unique Venetian Baroque interiors add another level of interest to the show. It's both raw and historical - unlike any other contemporary art space in the world - with ornaments, carvings and rich details. The Prada Foundation has a contract as a patron to rescue the building and bring the original frescoes and rare, fine materials back to life, ""without trying to modify it through characterless facelifts"", Celant explains. Modernity takes over . On the other side of the water, after the Rialto Bridge, there is the Fondaco Marcello, an exhibition space in a 15th century arms storehouse by the water front. Here the Biennale theme of Modernity extends into a scientific narrative, looking at possible ways of existence on the Antarctic continent, a subject in total contrast to the surrounding architectural heritage in Venice. The Antarctic Pavilion, curated by Nadim Samman makes you think of lifestyle and tourism, as well as the ecological and political questions posed by those extreme conditions on the margins of civilization. Further down towards San Marco Square, a giant composition of 1,179 stainless steel bikes has been neatly stacked on the canal side courtyard garden of the Palazzo Cavalli-Franchetti near the Accademia bridge. This art installation, titled ""Forever"" by Ai Weiwei is part of the exhibition Genius Loci, brought to Venice by the Lisson Gallery. The show continues inside the 16th century palace building with sculptures and installations by international artists including Tony Cragg, Lee Ufan, Julian Opie and Joana Vasconcelos. Contemporary public art . The rest is slightly more modest in scale than Ai Weiwei's installation, but still spectacular examples of ideas addressed in contemporary public works. There is a sense of play with architecture and space, exploring the parallels between the two disciplines, such as Anish Kapoor's work which deals with our spatial perceptions. This exhibition suggests that genius loci 'the special spirit' can be found in the urban space through artworks, materials and forms; a departure from the modernist obsession with functionality. A short hop on a vaporetto takes you across the lagoon from San Marco to the island of San Giorgio Maggiore, which has become a site for displaying large public installations. This year a geometric sculpture entitled ""The Sky Over Nine Columns"" dominates the waterfront square next to Palladio's famous church. Its surfaces are covered with golden glass mosaics, beautifully reflecting the Venetian sun. The piece by Heinz Mack, who represented Germany at the Arts Biennale in 1970, was commissioned by the Cini Foundation. Mack is known for monumental installations: ""My sculptures are objects of light in space"" Mack said. Behind the church, an exquisitely crafted pavilion has been erected in the garden of the Stanze del Vetro glass museum. The aquarium-like Glass Tea House Mondrian is designed by Japanese artist Hiroshi Sugimoto, best known for his minimalistic photography. Sugimoto's pavilion is the first in a series of commissions, supported by the Cini Foundation, which follows the model of the Serpentine Pavilion in London. Installed inside a cedar wood fenced garden, the glass pavilion will also be the setting for a traditional tea ceremony, a performance which exemplifies the delicacy in Japanese culture. All these shows run parallel to the Architecture Biennale, overseen by Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas this year. Even if you don't have time to visit the Giardini and the national pavilions, these events outside the main programme are some fantastic cultural offerings, adding another level of meaning to visiting a city with such rich heritage.

"(CNN) -- City life can be stressful. Johannesburg life can be hair-pullingly, nail-bitingly, heart-attackingly stressful. So leaving the city once in a while is essential. ""I love the diversity and anonymity of Joburg,"" says management consultant Genevieve De Carcenac, who moved to Joburg from a sleepy village in northern Kwazulu-Natal 17 years ago. ""People have such drive here and it's the hip and happening place to be in South Africa. But it's quite a pressurized environment and this forces you to get out when you can. ""You need to unwind in big sky country."" Here are four places to do just that. Pilanesberg National Park . Some Joburgers turn their noses up at this game reserve, saying it's like a zoo. That's because it has tarred roads and is only a couple hours drive away. But it's pretty big (220 square miles), malaria-free, has the Big Five and the animals are definitely wild, judging by the bull elephant that charged me last time I visited. The best way to appreciate the park is to pack a few cool ones and some meat and start the day with a fry-up at one of the many braais provided. It's very do-able to spend just a day at the park, located west of Pretoria. There are gravel roads to escape the crowds and although guided safari drives are available it's more fun to drive yourself. You'd be pretty unlucky not to see some impressive animals. South Africans are generous about sharing sightings so if someone waves you down, they may want to point out where to go. Accommodation ranges from camping to luxury lodges. If you like being in nature but not roughing it, an executive safari tent at Bakgatla Resort (Bakgatla Resort; Bakgatla Gate; +27 14 555 1045) is around R1700 ($160) in peak season. Or for a surreal experience, Sun City (Sun City; +27 14 557 1000) borders the park. The themed resort is South Africa's Las Vegas and takes kitsch to a new level -- but can be pretty fun. Pilanesberg National Park . Drakensberg mountains . South Africans refer to this range as simply the Berg (mountains) -- as if there were really only one that counts. Depending on where you go it takes three to five hours to drive here from Joburg, but it feels like another world. With peaks up to 3,500 meters high, the Berg are one of the most spectacular mountain ranges in the world and where Joburgers come for a complete change. The contrast with city life could not be more stark, from the wide open spaces instead of electric fences and a slower rural pace of life instead of constant rush. The Northern Berg are closest to Joburg and bounded by an eight-kilometer high rock escarpment. To lie on the grass gazing up at the escarpment from Thendele (uKhahlamba-Drakensberg Park 036 438 6411; from R900 ($84.50)), a hutted camp in its shadow, is an uplifting experience. There are day hikes of varying lengths from here up the Tugela Falls waterfall. Avoid the R74 when driving to the northern Berg. An 18-kilometer section is still unfinished and avoiding the potholes and navigating through the frequent mists while trying not to drop off the edge is terrifying. The Central Berg encompasses some of the most challenging peaks such as Cathedral Peak and Giant's Castle. Detailed maps and preferably guides are needed for hiking here -- snow, floods, arduous climbs and snakes make it a serious prospect. Cathedral Peak is popular with South Africans families and has fantastic facilities, but the decor is decidedly 1980s. You can stay in a dorm (from R150 ($14)) or a traditional rondavel (from R250 ($23.50)) at Inkosana Lodge (Inkosana Lodge; R600; +27 36 4681202), which has a great asset in the form of owner and former mountaineer Ed. Midlands . Rolling green fields, cows, drizzle and mist. Not England, but the Midlands three hours drive south of Joburg in KwaZulu-Natal. The area was originally settled by British farmers. The dairy cows lead a happy existence here, making for a delicious cream tea. The Midlands are lovely to visit in autumn or winter, when you can warm up around the fire after a stroll over the hills and eat and drink in one of the many excellent hotels. Staying at Hartford House (Hartford House; Hlatikulu Road, Mooi River; +27 33 263 2713) is like being in the middle of a posh English country estate. It's also a working stud farm, housing famous stallions from racing history, which you can visit on a tour. The restaurant is one of the best in South Africa, a blend of classical and inventive use of local ingredients. The Midlands Meander isn't that easy to navigate, mainly due to the ridiculous ye olde worlde names given to places that tell you nothing about what they offer. There are several interesting micro-breweries and craft shops along the way. Tsonga shoes are locally made and benefit rural communities. (They're also the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn in my life.) The Midlands are a convenient base to visit the famous battlefields around the towns of Ladysmith and Dundee. It may seem like boring history but the stories behind the battles between British and Zulu warriors in the green foothills are spell-binding. Magliesberg . You'd describe this ancient mountain range as pleasant, rather than awesome like the Drakensberg. But it's under two hours from Joburg and a great place to breathe fresh air and recharge. There's a 120 kilometer-long mountain range to explore, as well as forests, streams and Hartebeesport Dam, which borders the Magliesberg in the east. I only have one moan, and that's the lack of public walking trails. The only way around it is to join a guided walk on private land, pay for day access or stay somewhere you can hike. You can burn off some stress walking at Mountain Sanctuary (Mountain Sanctuary; Maanhaarrand Road; +27 14 534 0114) nature reserve and cool off by jumping into the clear rock pools. This is also a lovely place to stay, either camping (R100 ($9.40)) or in a log cabin (R450 ($42.30)). I also like Kashan Country House (Steynshoop Mountain Lodge; Steynshoop Farm Hekpoort; 014 576 1035), right at the foot of the mountains and that does simple but delicious food. Magalies Sleepy River campsite (Magalies Sleepy River; R560; +27 82 555 9681) has lots of shady spots. Though many South Africans view camping as an excuse for a party and it can get pretty rowdy. The Magliesberg Canopy Tour (Magliesberg Canopy Tour; Sparkling Waters Hotel; +27 (0)14 535 0150) is not for those with a fear of heights. You slide down cables between platforms perched high on the rock face (R495 ($46.50). There's also a fantastic view of the mountains from a hot air balloon, operated by several companies. Claire Hu is a wine, food, culture and travel journalist based in South Africa.","The Drakensberg mountains are just a few hours from Johannesburg, but feel like another world .

"(CNN)  -- Did Jamie Oliver really shape up America's unhealthiest city? A spokeswoman for Huntington, West Virginia -- the city Oliver singled out as one of the unhealthiest places in America -- says local residents are exercising and eating better. But she's not giving much credit to the cheeky British chef and nutrition activist. ""What people need to realize is there was already a movement to make Huntington healthier,"" says Brandi Jacobs-Jones, whose West Virginia hometown plays a starring role in Oliver's new macro-makeover show ""Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution,"" set to debut on ABC on Sunday. Huntington first made its way into the national consciousness in 2008, when The Associated Press named it ""America's fattest city,"" citing unmatched rates of obesity, heart disease and diabetes, and rates of toothlessness among older residents. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in a morbidity and mortality report released in February, said that 32.9 percent of the populace surveyed in an area that included Huntington and nearby Ashland, Kentucky, is obese. Jacob-Jones disputes those findings, saying the survey covered a broad tri-state area surrounding her college town. ""People think we're all morbidly obese, walking around eating pizza,"" she grumbles. ""We have 5Ks every weekend. When the production crew came here, I was like 'We have our teeth. We have master's degrees.' "" Not everyone is so tough on the celebrity chef. Angela Harrison, a TV reviewer for the Huntington Herald-Dispatch, says the show doesn't portray Huntington badly. Actually, she says, ""Oliver is very complimentary of Huntington and its people throughout the entire hour -- even when they give him a hard time."" Harrison says ""no one cuts him any slack"" when Huntington residents learn about disparaging comments the Naked Chef made about them to British press. ""I personally think it's the best moment of the show,"" Harrison says. Oliver and his crew descended on Huntington in the fall of 2009 with the admittedly ambitious goal of redefining its residents' relationship with food. His team spent five months consulting with cafeteria workers, coaching veggie-averse schoolchildren and opening up a community kitchen serving wholesome meals. ""The health statistics here are some of the most crippling and scary in the world,"" Oliver says in a show promo, calling Huntington ""a dark place."" Oliver took on Huntington after successfully reforming the school meal system in the United Kingdom. In the UK, Oliver spearheaded a healthy school lunch campaign that persuaded the government there to allocate more than $400 million for the lunches. If the trailer can be trusted, he apparently assumed his résumé entitled him to a hero's welcome and was stunned to discover skeptics who didn't share his revulsion to processed chicken nuggets. Oliver burst into tears after a hostile interview with a radio host who said, ""we don't want to sit around and eat lettuce all day."" The trailer then cuts to a weeping Oliver: ""They don't understand me,"" he says, ""they don't know why I'm here."" To the contrary, Jacobs-Jones says, the city of Huntington already had anti-obesity programs in place when Oliver showed up. His presence only served to ""further the mission"" by making healthy habits a popular conversation topic. ""We are creating a committee to evaluate how we can implement some of Jamie's suggestions,"" she adds diplomatically. Jacobs-Jones suspects the lasting result of Oliver's extended stay might not be trimmer waistlines, but fattened city coffers. ""I firmly believe anything that puts us on the national forefront is good,"" she says. ""We're applying for a Google program right now, and maybe this will help. You never know.""","Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver takes on obesity in Huntington, West Virginia .

"(CNN) -- A large storm system flooding portions of New York, Pennsylvania and New England on Friday afternoon has claimed at least eight lives, including seven in North Carolina, officials said. Nowhere was the misery more evident than Bertie County in northeastern North Carolina, where water in places was almost to the top of stop signs. The situation in the town of Windsor, which has about 2,000 residents, was dire Friday afternoon, said County Manager Zee Lamb. Perhaps 175 people have been rescued from rising floodwaters since Thursday night, Lamb said. ""A lot of people cannot get to their homes."" Rescue shelters were set up and animals in a small zoo were taken to higher ground. Dramatic video footage showed the damage and the Cashie River, which is about 16 feet above flood stage. Most roads to the town were closed or partially closed. ""The county library is under 5 feet of water in the town of Windsor,"" Lamb said. ""You cannot get to the courthouse by road. I got here by boat today."" Many businesses in the city are underwater, said Lamb, adding the county has asked the state for emergency assistance. Some buildings had water 6 to 7 feet deep on their first floor. Historic homes in the town were damaged. Townspeople were surprised by the extent of the flooding, Lamb said. ""[Hurricane] Floyd [in 1999] was supposed to be the 100-year-old flood. Eleven years later we have another major flood."" The storm system was dropping heavy rain in the Northeast as the remnants of Tropical Storm Nicole interacted with an upper-level low and a frontal boundary. An advisory from the National Weather Service said up to three more inches of rain may fall in the region. Flood watches and warnings were in effect from the mid-Atlantic states to Maine. High-wind warnings were in effect from Massachusetts to Maine, with wind gusts up to 60 mph. Boston was already feeling the effects, although the rain was expected to clear by Saturday morning. Philadelphia and much of eastern and central Pennsylvania were deluged by rainfall and a motorist died after driving into floodwaters near Skippack Creek, state troopers said. Troopers saw the vehicle floating near a golf course but were unable to reach the female driver, who was later found dead. Police said a 72-year-old woman was trapped for more than eight hours inside her car in Cumru Township before she escaped, according to WFMZ. The outlook was for clearer skies later in the day. A weather-related accident Thursday claimed four lives in Washington County, North Carolina, where a Jeep Grand Cherokee hydroplaned and ended up in a ditch filled with water. Four of five people in the SUV drowned. They were from Gwinnett County, Georgia. A 3-year-old survived and was hospitalized Friday, officials said. Two motorists died in Dare County on Friday, and another was killed in Pamlico County, said Julia Jarema, spokeswoman for the North Carolina Division of Emergency Management. About 150 roads were in North Carolina at one point were closed and some people were evacuated in Bertie County, said Patty McQuillan, communications officer for the state's Department of Crime Control and Public Safety. Major road closures included U.S. 158 in Elizabeth City, U.S. 264 in Beaufort County and U.S. 17 in Windsor. In Swansboro, North Carolina, eight people were rescued, an emergency management official said. That scene repeated itself in a few other North Carolina and Virginia communities. Airport delays are expected to be crippling in the Northeast again, with ground stops and delays of three hours or more at the New York City airports and in Boston, Massachusetts. Baltimore, Maryland -- at 6.02 inches -- on Thursday had its wettest September day ever. Norfolk, Virginia, endured nearly 12 inches of rainfall. CNN affiliate WUSA showed images of flooding in St. Mary's County, Maryland. Rain left city streets underwater, stranded vehicles and sent scores of people to shelters and caused major delays at airports along the East Coast. Skies were beginning to clear Friday in much of the Carolinas and Virginia. Wilmington, North Carolina, has received 22.54 inches of rain since Sunday, the National Weather Service said. September's total of 22.72 inches was shy of the record 23.41 inches in 1999. ""Water-wise, it was significant,"" said Warren Lee, emergency management director for New Hanover County, which includes three beach communities. Monday was actually worse than Thursday, said Lee, because the heavy rain hit bone-dry ground and sparked flash flooding. Crews will do a damage assessment Friday, he said, indicating there were few evacuations and little wind damage. Sixty miles up the coast, there was extensive flooding in Swansboro, according to Norman Bryson with Onslow County Emergency Management. The town was completely cut off to vehicular traffic. In Carolina Beach, a lake overflowed and flooded downtown, a video from CNN affiliate WRAL showed one person kayaking through the streets. U.S. 421 remained closed Friday morning. Carolina Beach Town Manager Tim Owens said the weather was improving Friday and the town expects tourists to return for the weekend. He said some residents near the retention lake likely have some flood damage. ""We fared pretty well,"" he said. CNN iReporters snapped flood photos and told their tales. In upstate New York, Esopus Creek, a tributary of the Hudson River, overflowed and flooded shops and homes in downtown Phoenicia, said Kevin Keaveny. ""I've never seen the water come up to the streets,"" he said. Margaret Pelczynski of Buffalo, New York, was visiting Carolina Beach. ""This only confirms my beliefs that I'd gladly take a blizzard any day over this rain, wind and flooding,"" she wrote. And William Bernstein Jr. posted photos of Virginia Beach, Virginia. He said there were rescues Thursday and trees down in the Tidewater area. ""I believe this will be one we will remember a long time,"" he wrote. In Norfolk and Portsmouth, Virginia, many streets were flooded, as were stretches of Interstate 264, according to CNN Virginia affiliate WAVY 10. Some in the area are without power because of downed lines. Chris Hauser of Suffolk told WAVY he woke up to find water in his garage and up to 14 inches of water in his back yard, which is near a lake. As he stood on wooden planks just above the floodwater, Hauser quipped, ""Now I have my dock that I always thought about building.""

"(CNN) -- President Obama needs to send U.S. marshals to Southern California. They can protect the Central American women and children whom the federal government has sent out West, with more due to arrive every 72 hours under an immigrant redistribution plan hatched by the Obama administration. The next group of immigrants is expected to arrive on July 7. The marshals could ensure that nobody interferes with this federal law enforcement operation, as was done last week by angry protesters in Murrieta, California, a small town in southwest Riverside County, about 70 miles north of San Diego. It was there that the Border Patrol had planned to process about 140 women and children who had, just a few hours earlier, arrived on a plane from South Texas. More than 52,000 unaccompanied minors have been caught trying to cross the U.S.-Mexico border since October. I've written about immigration for 25 years and, from my many visits to the U.S.-Mexico border, and the tours I've taken with Border Patrol agents in Arizona, Texas and California, I know this much: The war against immigrant smugglers is a battle of wits and a contest of wills. In managing the border children crisis, the Border Patrol recently showed wits. Now, by sending in the marshals, Obama can demonstrate the will. Last week, on the Fourth of July, Border Patrol agents avoided some unpleasant fireworks by outsmarting dozens of those who are against the buses and those who aren't. Both crowds had descended on Murrieta anticipating a repeat of what had happened three days earlier, when the group protesting the arrivals blocked and turned around three Department of Homeland Security buses carrying the women and children. In both protests, Murrieta police officers were on the scene. But during the first one, they were worthless. They should have arrested those protesters who blocked Border Patrol buses and forced them to retreat. They were better during the sequel, and, in fact, arrested a handful of people. While the dueling crowds were facing off in Murrieta, the Border Patrol took a detour from the airport and transported the immigrants to another processing center in San Ysidro, about 15 miles south of San Diego. There will likely be more protests in California over the next few weeks. If things get out of hand, someone could get hurt. That's why we need U.S. marshals, to prevent that from happening. I shouldn't have to make federal case out of this, because it already is one. It's a federal policy that lets these children stay in the United States with relatives. They're in the custody of a federal agency, in a federal law enforcement vehicle, driven by federal law enforcement officers. It's the federal government's job to protect its personnel and the people being transported and to ensure that this operation is not sidetracked by mob rule, even if that means arresting those who get in the way. The images coming out of Murrieta reminded me of another group of protesters intent on defying an order from the federal government: white Southerners in the 1960s. They also terrorized children, African-Americans who sought to attend desegregated public schools, much as the children on the bus were terrorized by the angry mob. It's not a perfect comparison; the children on the bus were undocumented immigrants, many of whom might qualify for refugee status if they can show ""credible fear"" of returning to their home countries. The African-American children were U.S. citizens. Still, I wasn't the only person in America thinking that we had seen this movie before. ""This green-eyed and blond-with-gray woman who is 74 years old cannot believe that 'my fellow citizens' haven't learned anything over the last 50-plus years,"" wrote one reader. ""I remember college friends who went to Alabama and Mississippi to help register voters, teach people to read, march for civil rights for ALL of us, no matter what color or race or socioeconomic status. Opinion: The right fate for immigrant kids . ""The screaming and hateful people in (Murrieta) reminded me of the people who screamed at little black kids walking to schools (accompanied by law enforcement), who treated James Meredith and Autherine Lucy and so many young people horribly. It is so sad that after all these years, so many people haven't gotten a clue about decency and kindness."" In 1956, Lucy was the first African-American to attend the University of Alabama. In 1962, Meredith became the first African-American to attend the University of Mississippi. Both students were tormented by classmates. Once Meredith enrolled at Ole Miss, rioting broke out on the Oxford, Mississippi, campus. Attorney General Robert Kennedy sent 500 U.S. marshals to maintain order and protect the civil rights pioneer. By trying to thwart the intent of the federal government, the Murrieta mob seems to want to relive the '60s. Fine. Let's go back to the '60s. Send in the marshals.","Ruben Navarrette: Obama needs to send U.S. marshals to protect women, kids at border .

"(InStyle.com) -- History's best bathing suits aren't always practical -- Raquel Welch's Paleolithic two-piece from One Million Years B.C. wouldn't have lasted long in open water--but they're impossible to forget. InStyle fashion director Hal Rubenstein shares the top ten on-screen swimsuits that are forever in our memories. 1. URSULA ANDRESS in ""Dr. No"" (1962)   As Honey Rider, she stepped out of the Caribbean and into the fantasies of every guy longing to be James Bond. The matching knife belt was a cute touch. 2. PHOEBE CATES in ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" (1982)  Backed by a curtain of sprinkler-coated sunbeams, Cates's high school princess joined the pool party in a skimpy bikini as red as her lipstick. A besotted Judge Reinhold -- and a generation of teenage boys in the movie theater -- envisioned unhooking her top. See all 21 iconic swimsuits . 3. BO DEREK in ""10"" (1979)  Her perfect score has never been beaten. But then, how many women fill out a nude maillot like second skin and get spotted running down a beach in slow motion? Derek may have been the best thing to happen to sales of the one-piece. 4. ELIZABETH TAYLOR in ""Suddenly, Last Summer"" (1959)  In Tennessee Williams brilliantly macabre classic, Catherine Holly's cousin deliberately dressed her in a plunging, stark white maillot so that every man on the beach would come a little bit closer for a better look at her, and then he could get a better look at them. Considering the attraction was Elizabeth Taylor, everyone wound up with a lot to look at. 5. The FARRAH FAWCETT poster (1976)  To promote her instant celebrity in ""Charlie's Angels,"" a Cleveland poster company arranged to shoot Fawcett in a bikini at her house. But the actress wasn't comfortable so exposed. So she pulled this red one-piece from her closet. The company hated the pic, but Farrah had final approval (and retained photo rights). Smart girl: The poster sold over 12 million copies and is still for sale today. 10 slimming swimsuits for curvy women . 6. JESSICA ALBA in ""Into the Blue"" (2005)  Nobody remembers the film: It had something to do with sunken treasure, drugs, bad guys, six-pack abs, and a water park called ""Atlantis."" But plenty of people took notice of Alba's role as theme-park guide and her unmatched swimsuit: no doubt bikini separates gained in popularity after this promo shot was released. Stars in bikinis . 7. PAMELA ANDERSON in ""Baywatch"" (1992)  ""The world's most popular series"" is gone, but you can still buy a copy of the suit with the sky-high-cut thigh online. However, good luck looking as good in it as Anderson's CJ Parker. Funny, Anderson wasn't in the original cast. But who can imagine ""Babewatch"" without her? 8. CARRIE FISHER in ""Return of the Jedi"" (1983)  Today, it may be hard to reconcile the acid tongue and ruthless honesty of this writer, performer and popular Hollywood script doctor with her former role as Sci-fi's most famous princess. But at the height of ""Return of the Jedi's"" climax, Luke Skywalker rescued Leia from the swirling gold and chain link bondage gear of Jabba the Hut -- and her sexy suit remains one of the most memorable in the galaxy. Easy summer hairstyles . 9. RACQUEL WELCH in ""One Million Years B.C."" (1966)  Ok, so maybe the dates aren't quite accurate. In fact, if most women in prehistoric times really looked and dressed like this, a lot more people today would be studying cave paintings. As fabulous as it is ludicrous, Welch's animal-skin bikini may be film's most famous bathing suit that never got wet. Flattering one-piece swimsuits . 10. HALLE BERRY in ""Die Another Day"" (2002)  Best way to revive a fading franchise? Go back to square one. In ""Die Another Day,"" another breathtaking beauty (this time an Oscar-winner) made an entrance straight from the ocean. An inspired homage to Ursula Andress's original Bond girl, Berry's fire-orange-clad Jinx Johnson killed -- both literally and figuratively.

"Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (CNN) -- Oklahoma voters are considering an unusual question that will appear on their ballots this Tuesday: whether Islamic law can be used in considering cases in state court. The question is the doing of State Rep. Rex Duncan. The Republican is the main author of State Question 755, also known as the ""Save our State"" constitutional amendment, one of 11 questions on the state ballot. The question might seem a befuddling one for a ballot in the heartland, but it stems from a New Jersey legal case in which a Muslim woman went to a family court asking for a restraining order against her spouse claiming he had raped her repeatedly. The judge ruled against her, saying that her husband was abiding by his Muslim beliefs regarding spousal duties. The decision was later overruled by an appellate court, but the case sparked a firestorm. Duncan secured support for the proposal on the state's Senate side from fellow Republican Anthony Sykes, who co-authored the measure. ""The fact that Sharia law was even considered anywhere in the United States is enough for me"" to sign on, Sykes told CNN. ""It should scare anyone that any judge in America would consider using that as precedent."" Sykes said his concern was compounded by Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan's comments during her confirmation hearings in June that she would be willing to consider international law when considering cases before the court. Saleem Quraishi, president of the American Muslim Association of Oklahoma City who runs the Islamic Center at the Grand Mosque of Oklahoma City, said there are more than 5,000 Muslims in the city. While there are no exact numbers for the Muslim population in the state, it is not among the larger communities, said Ibrahim Hooper of the Council on American-Islamic Relations . ""It's just fear mongering; it's nothing,"" Quraishi told CNN. ""What's Sharia law have to do with Oklahoma?"" Some 1,200 Muslims from India, Bangladesh, the Middle East, Africa and elsewhere participate in services at the Islamic Center of Oklahoma City, according to Quraishi The facility, founded by Oklahoma City cardiologist M.A. Shakir, has been open for about two years. Another Islamic center is just two miles away. Quraishi insists that Islam does not allow for men to mistreat women, and that the New Jersey case involved a ""crazy, loony man, unfortunately a Muslim."" ""That is not Islam,"" he said. ""Oklahoma, you know, is a very Republican state,"" Quraishi said. He accused some lawmakers with attempting to instill fear in the heads of constituents in order to drum up votes. ""But Oklahomans are not like that. I know most of the Oklahomans. They're very nice people."" As written on the ballot, the measure states it would amend a state constitution section dealing with the state courts, making them ""rely on federal and state law when deciding cases, forbidding them ""from considering or using international law"" and ""from considering or using Sharia Law."" The ballot then briefly describes international law, which ""deals with the conduct of international organizations and independent nations, such as countries, states and tribes,"" and Sharia, which is ""based on two principal sources, the Koran and the teaching of Mohammed."" ""Shall the proposal be approved?"" the ballot reads, instructing voters to respond 'yes' if they're for the proposal and 'no' if they're against it. Former U.S. Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich touched on the issue during a speech to the fifth annual Values Voter Summit in Washington in September. ""I am totally opposed to any effort to impose Sharia on the United States, and we should have a federal law that says under no circumstance, in any jurisdiction in the United States, will Sharia be used in any court to apply to any judgment made about American law,"" Gingrich said. Oklahoma's proposed constitutional amendment coincides with heated discussion regarding a 13-story Islamic Center planned for two blocks from the World Trade Center site in New York City. The state had its own encounter with terrorism in 1995 when the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building was struck by a bomb. Timothy McVeigh was convicted for the attack, which killed 168 people, including 19 children. McVeigh was not a Muslim. The activist group Act for America, a self-described issues advocacy organization, recently launched a $45,000 grass-roots campaign in Oklahoma to urge voters to support State Question 755. The group sponsored a one-minute radio ad airing across the state that warns against Sharia. In the ad, a voice says, ""A husband was brutally beating and raping his wife several times a day. Desperate to save her life, this Muslim woman sought a restraining order against him. But the judge ruled against her, saying her husband had not committed a crime."" The commercial then said this case happened not in Saudi Arabia or Iran, but in New Jersey. ""This is just one chilling example of how Islamic Sharia law has begun to penetrate America,"" the ad continued. ""Help us stop Sharia law from coming to Oklahoma."" The group is also sponsoring automated phone calls to Oklahoma voters from former CIA director and Oklahoma native James Woolsey. ""We must realize there is a major campaign in Europe to impose Sharia law and Sharia is beginning to be cited in a few U.S courts. It is completely incompatible with our Constitution,"" says Woolsey, who also says that he is not advocating interference with Muslims practicing their religion. Despite the publicity, many Oklahomans are unfamiliar with the proposed amendment, which is largely overshadowed by another ballot question proposing that the state annually fund public education to a minimum of the per-student average of neighboring states. Another proposal, Question 751, would make English the official language of Oklahoma. Those voters who are familiar with the Sharia initiative are largely inclined to vote for it, but few who spoke with CNN were very excited about it. Diana Anderson, a legal assistant, said she supports the measure. ""I don't know that it would make much difference, but if there is something that comes up that has to do with Islamic law, or treating women that way, I don't want them to be treated badly and I don't want us to have any problem with the way they treat them in court either,"" Anderson said. Lawyer Bill Price said he would probably vote for the proposal, but he doesn't feel strongly about it one way or the other. ""I don't think there's much of a chance of Sharia law becoming any kind of law in Oklahoma,"" said Price. ""There are much more important issues."" Sykes admits the notion of Sharia taking precedence in Oklahoma's courts is not looming on voters' minds. ""It's not a problem and we want to keep it that way,"" he said. ""And we hope this state question will have that effect, to make it crystal clear that that's not to be considered in Oklahoma, nor is international law.""","Ballot proposal would ban Sharia from being considered in Oklahoma courts .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- A Green Beret sergeant was electrocuted in Iraq in 2008 because of failures by the U.S. military and a major defense contractor, which did not properly ground and inspect electrical equipment, according to a Pentagon report out Monday. Staff Sgt. Ryan Maseth, a 24-year-old Green Beret, died in a shower at his base in Iraq in January 2008. Nine of 18 electrocution deaths reported in Iraq were caused by ""improper grounding or faulty equipment,"" including the January 2008 death of Staff Sgt. Ryan Maseth, the Defense Department's inspector-general found. Investigations remain open in five of those cases, according to a summary of the report obtained by CNN. The new report concluded that ""multiple systems and organizations failed,"" leaving Maseth ""exposed to unacceptable risk."" The decorated soldier from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was electrocuted in a shower at a U.S. base in Baghdad that once served as one of Saddam Hussein's palaces. The report found that a water pump installed by military contractor KBR was not grounded, leading to Maseth's electrocution when it short-circuited. It found that Maseth's commanders failed to ensure that renovations to the palace had been properly done, the Army did not set standards for jobs or contractors, and KBR did not ground electrical equipment it installed at the facility. The Houston, Texas-based company has defended its performance in the war zone from extensive criticism by Congress and has argued that it was not to blame for any fatalities. In a statement issued Monday afternoon, it said it had not seen the Pentagon report and would not comment. ""While the death of Staff Sgt. Maseth was tragic, KBR continues to maintain that it was not responsible for his death,"" company spokeswoman Heather Browne said. ""The building in which Staff Sgt. Maseth lived was built by Iraqi and other contractors under the previous Iraqi leadership."" Brown said the building, ""like many other pre-existing buildings in Iraq, had not been grounded or bonded by the contractors who built the structure,"" and she said KBR had warned the military about the hazard nine months before Maseth died. ""Prior to that incident, the military never directed KBR to repair, upgrade or improve the grounding system in the building in which Maseth resided, nor was KBR directed to perform any preventive maintenance at this facility,"" Browne said. But Maseth's mother, who has filed suit against KBR in her son's death, said she was ""pleased"" by the findings. ""The results are revealing and contrary to what KBR and its president have continuously stated over the past year,"" Cheryl Harris said. ""On that note, the DOD IG report states that KBR installed the water pump that killed my son, a point that KBR has flatly denied over the past year."" Maseth's death led to congressional hearings in 2008 and demands for a full investigation by the military, which resulted in the report out Monday. Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey, who pushed for the investigation, said Monday's report should not be the end of the process. ""We cannot stop with the publication of this report alone,"" the Democrat said in a written statement. ""Those who failed to carry out their contractual obligations in a way that contributed to the death of a U.S. soldier should be held fully accountable for their negligence."" Another report is being prepared by the Army's Criminal Investigation Division, Casey said. Maseth's family and that of Christopher Everett, another soldier mentioned in the report, have sued KBR over their deaths. Everett, an Army sergeant, was electrocuted in 2005 while using a power washer at an American base outside Ramadi. Other deaths the inspector-general's report found were caused by faulty electrical equipment or improper grounding include the death of Army Spc. Marvin Campo-Siles in April 2004 in Samarra; Spc. Chase Whitham, May 2004, in Mosul; Spc. Marcus Nolasco, also May 2004, in Baiji; Marine Pfc. Brian Cutter, in Fallujah, the same month; Navy Hospital Corpsman 3rd Class David Cedergren, killed in Iskandariya in September 2004; Sgt. Michael Montpetit, who died in Baghdad in June 2007; and Sohan Singh, a private contractor killed in Fallujah in July 2005. In March, a top Army inspector said that thousands of buildings on U.S. bases in Iraq and Afghanistan have such poorly installed wiring that American troops face life-threatening risks. Jim Childs, a master electrician and the top civilian expert in an Army safety survey, said problems were ""everywhere"" in Iraq, where 18 U.S. troops have died by electrocution since 2003. The nine electrocutions not caused by faulty grounding were caused by other electrical accidents, such as contact with live power lines. CNN's Matt Smith contributed to this report.","KBR denies responsibility; soldier's mother ""pleased""

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- The Mexican government on Sunday dissolved the company that supplies power to the capital and four central states because of the utility's unsustainable financial position, Interior Minister Fernando Gomez Mont said. Police erect a barrier outside the offices of Luz y Fuerza del Centro in Mexico City. Hundreds of federal police officers seized the facilities of the company, Luz y Fuerza del Centro, in Mexico City and the states of Hidalgo, Mexico, Morelos and Puebla. Luz y Fuerza del Centro is a decentralized public agency, incorporated as a company with its own assets. The government dissolved the company because ""its operations are no longer beneficial from the point of view of the national economy or the interests of the public,"" Gomez Mont said at a news conference. The Federal Electricity Commission, known by its Spanish initials, CFE, will take over operations. Service will be uninterrupted, the government said. Inefficiencies at Luz y Fuerza del Centro were costing the government billions of dollars in subsidies to keep the company afloat, Gomez Mont said. At the current rate, the government would have to subsidize the company to the tune of 300 billion pesos (U.S. $22.5 billion) by 2012, the minister said. The utility had also been ensnared in a labor dispute between federal officials and a union representing Luz y Fuerza del Centro employees. The Mexican Electricians Union, one of the most powerful in the country, represents about 60,000 workers. ""They have declared war and we are going to respond, exercising our constitutional rights and guarantees, let there be no doubt about that,"" the union said in a statement Sunday. Union supporters organized a protest march to the interior ministry Sunday to demand an audience with Gomez Mont. Union leaders were not available for comment Sunday morning because all of the directors were participating in the march, a union employee told CNN. The government cited labor rules imposed by the union as a cause of the inefficiency. ""Practically all of the decisions of Luz y Fuerza del Centro had to be taken to serve the demands of the union and not in the interests of the consumers,"" Gomez Mont said. Luz y Fuerza del Centro had sales of 730 megawatt-hours per worker, Gomez Mont said, compared to 2,500 megawatt-hours per worker for CFE. The minister also said the union continued to grow its workforce to benefit itself and not the company's operations. CFE operates with one electricity distribution employee per 627 consumers; LFC had one distribution employee per 291 users, Gomez Mont said. The federal government will honor the terms of the collective bargaining agreement regarding the laid-off workers, he said, and will pay the pensions of retired employees. The move does not signal a shift toward the privatization of electric utilities, Gomez Mont said. Early this month, members of the Mexican Electricians Union demonstrated outside the president's residence to demand recognition of their leader. On Monday, the government refused to recognize Martin Esparza, alleging a fraudulent election process.","NEW: Service won't be interrupted as another company will take over, officials say .

"(CNN) -- Three people died and two were injured when a small aircraft and a helicopter collided Thursday afternoon at a municipal airport in Frederick, Maryland, according to Frederick County Fire Chief Denise Pouget. Maryland State Police told CNN it ""appeared"" to have been an in-flight collision. ""Emergency personnel from Frederick County responded and found two crash scenes,"" said Maryland State Police spokesman Greg Shipley. ""A small plane was found in a thin wooded tree line. Two persons were aboard that aircraft both of whom were transported to the Meredith Medical Center in Hagerstown.""

There were three people confirmed deceased. We do not know if all three were on board the aircraft,"" said Shipley. The two survivors taken to a hospital were later discharged, said Meritus Medical Center spokeswoman Joelle Butler. One of the men was uninjured and the other had a laceration to the forehead, said National Transportation Safety Board investigator Brian Rainer. A preliminary incident report released by the Federal Aviation Administration said a Cirrus SR 22 aircraft and an R44 helicopter collided at the southwest corner of Frederick Municipal Airport at about 3:40 p.m. ET. ""It was about a mile from the airport in an open field. It's an industrial area,"" said Pouget. ""The SR22 was inbound to the airport and the helicopter was involved in a training exercise when the accident occurred,"" said the FAA. The FlightAware online tracking page showed the plane, with the tail number N122ES, left Cleveland Regional Jetport at 12:47 p.m. ET. The plane was registered to Graeves Auto & Appliance in Olney, Maryland. The helicopter, tail number N7518Q, was registered to Robinson Helicopter Company, Fly for Fun LLC, in Rockville, Maryland. Records indicated it could carry up to four passengers. Audio from air traffic control recordings indicated the aircraft was cleared for landing seconds before the crash. The airport tower control operator can be heard telling the pilot ""three helicopters below you in the traffic pattern"" as she directed the pilot to a runway. Moments later, an airport worker can be heard telling the tower operator ""airplane down and helicopter down."" FAA records indicated the plane was a fixed wing, single-engine craft. It had a parachute mechanism which deployed during the crash, as could be seen in video shot by CNN affiliate WJZ. Video showed the plane hanging from trees with an orange and white parachute deployed over a grassy area. Wreckage of a green helicopter could be seen by an airport building. The FAA and the NTSB will investigate. ""We have a helicopter specialist in route and an air traffic control investigator. We may expand the team to include an operation specialist,"" said Rainer.

"(CNN) -- Even though he sailed to the White House on the wings of his soaring rhetoric, President Barack Obama could find that he is on mission impossible as he launches his media blitz on Syria this week -- six television interviews on Monday and a dramatic prime time address on Tuesday. Perhaps he will persuade a skeptical public, but it is surely the toughest speaking assignment of his presidency. Surprisingly, he is now tripling down on his Syrian bet. First he drew the red line, uncertain whether President Bashar al-Assad would call his bluff. Then he doubled down by insisting on a vote from an unreliable Congress. Now he is placing almost all his chips on the table by betting on his capacity to turn around public opinion. If he wins over the public, he will likely win Congress, too, but if he fails, he will have turned a problem in Syria into a crisis in his presidency. (Someday, in their memoirs, will White House insiders please tell us what they were thinking?) There are at least two major hurdles in his path as he seeks to persuade the public. First, he will be trying to change opinion that has already started to harden against him. Second, the bully pulpit may not be as powerful as often imagined. The intensity factor . It's hard to remember a public terrain as rough as this one for a president in the past few decades. Weary of war and wary of another, Americans are in no mood to rally behind this call to arms -- many don't see it as our fight, they worry that it will drag us in deeper and even some of his most ardent supporters think the president and his team don't have a firm grip on the wheel. A Gallup poll late this past week found that a majority of the public (51% to 36%) is opposed to a Syrian strike. That is the lowest level of support Gallup has found for any intervention in two decades. Moreover, the ""intensity factor"" runs much more strongly among opponents -- just look at the avalanche of their calls and e-mails to Capitol Hill. The president has been arguing his case for nearly three weeks, and so far, he doesn't have many converts on the Hill. That's among Democrats as well as Republicans. CNN's whip count suggests that he could win a tight vote in the Senate (his speech may work best there), but a strike resolution is in serious trouble in the House. The Washington Post count shows that as many as a third of House Democrats may vote no. Even overseas, among nations much closer to Syria, the president's rhetorical offensive has fallen short. No president in modern times has had such a tiny coalition behind him. Eighteen nations contributed to the intervention in Libya. President George W. Bush had 48 nations in the coalition that attacked Saddam Hussein. This time around, Obama will have only a handful supporting his intervention and most will be cheering from the sidelines. A shaky pulpit . This controversy is also coming at an inopportune moment for the president. Early on at the White House, he could command massive, almost adoring audiences at every major address. But with the exception of his speech announcing the killing of Osama bin Laden, the numbers tuning in have dropped, viewers tend to be more partisan and television commentators have toughened up on him. Notably, his two Syrian interviews on television so far have drawn only modest audiences. It has been little noticed but is important now that Obama has also had more success selling himself than his policies. Obama's speeches -- despite their rhetorical strength and skilled delivery -- have had little success in moving his agenda forward. Americans still like him, but they tend to make up their own minds about his policies. Witness his inability, even now, to build a public majority in favor of Obamacare. The White House would argue that a majority have supported his stands on gun control and gay rights, but is that because of his speeches or because of demographic shifts and events such as the Newtown elementary school massacre? Indeed, there is now a debate among political scientists whether the bully pulpit is all that it is cracked up to be, especially in contemporary politics. Professor George Edwards of Texas A&M University and a dean among political scientists concluded in his 2006 book, ""On Deaf Ears: The Limits of the Bully Pulpit,"" that we have a highly inflated view of how much presidents have been able to change public minds through their speeches. He presents numerous cases to support his argument and one that is especially relevant today: . President Franklin D. Roosevelt had a legendary ability to connect with Americans through his fireside chats, but when it came to convincing a skeptical public about his Supreme Court-packing bill in his second term, the fire fizzled out. Edwards' data also suggests that presidents only succeed in mobilizing the public when opinion is already in their favor. This is clearly not the case with Syria. To our memory, the last Oval Office address that dramatically moved the public opinion needle over military conflict came in late 1983 when President Ronald Reagan spoke to the country about a bloody attack on marine barracks in Lebanon and U.S. intervention in the tiny island of Grenada. Public support for military action jumped 10 points in immediate polling. But in that case, Reagan was telling a story about what had already happened to a public whose majority already favored intervention. He was not asking them to rally round a new, uncertain venture, and he was also still in his first term when audiences were big. This is not to argue that all is lost for Obama on Tuesday night. Big speeches can reframe issues. They can unite us behind a higher purpose. They can push us to question our firmly held beliefs. Obama does have unusually persuasive powers. Perhaps he can come up with fresh arguments that will bring undecideds in his direction. Perhaps he will have horrific new evidence of how brutal al-Assad is. Perhaps ... perhaps, but if he has new arrows in his quiver, he likely would have shot them by now. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Gergan and Dan Katz .","Gergen, Katz: Rarely has a president faced as tough a public mood as does Obama .

"Washington (CNN) -- CNN's John King and other top political reporters empty out their notebooks each Sunday on ""Inside Politics"" to reveal five things that will be in the headlines in the days, weeks and months ahead. Insights on the reluctant ""wartime President"" and a concerned former President were part of a trip around the ""Inside Politics"" table that also highlighted an effort to leverage Latino political might, Rand Paul's minority outreach and a dilemma as GOP groups try to undermine potential Libertarian spoilers. 1. Back to the future: Bill Clinton adopts Arkansas as a 2014 project . For political junkies of any ideological persuasion, watching Bill Clinton on the stump is a treat, and it's an added bonus when he is back home in Arkansas. This past week, he was in fine form as he tried to give a boost to embattled Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor and other Arkansas Democrats, including gubernatorial candidate Mike Ross. Missed it? Not to worry. Jonathan Martin of The New York Times tells us you will get another chance. Maybe two. ""I'm told he's not just going back once, he's going to go back two more times to Arkansas: when early voting begins later this month, John, and then right before Election Day,"" said Martin. ""As one longtime friend of Bill Clinton told me -- who knows him better than anybody -- said if he could, he'd be doing direct-mail pieces."" While the former President does know several of the candidates on the ballot in Arkansas, Martin notes this involvement isn't motivated just by his friendships. ""He also cares about retaining some kind of Democratic strength in a state that has gone to the right, and I think he wants to try and make it at least potentially viable for his wife in 2016,"" said Martin. 2. The current commander in chief bemoans 'wartime' label . President Obama was first elected on a promise to get U.S. troops out of the Middle East, but he will wind down the final two years of his term directing a sustained military campaign against the terror group ISIS. And unlike George W. Bush, who embraced the ""wartime President"" label after the September 11, 2001, attacks, this commander in chief prefers not to be characterized that way. Julie Pace of The Associated Press took us inside the White House debate over how to handle the balancing act. ""One of the concerns is that they don't want to present him as a wartime President, because he was campaigning as a person who got the U.S. out of wars, but they also want to make sure that he looks like he is managing the situation,"" said Pace. ""So while you're not going to see the President making trips to war zones overseas, you are going to see more pictures of him meeting with commanders at the Pentagon, perhaps traveling to bases around the country. The whole idea is to show that even though he'd rather be talking about other things, he's still on top of this."" 3. Latinos see LGBT advances as an example worth following . As Latinos look to maximize their political clout, Ed O'Keefe of The Washington Post says some key activists have an example of steady, if sometimes slow, progress. O'Keefe shared reporting about a recent Arizona summit of Latino, legal and labor activists, which took place just as the Supreme Court declined to hear challenges to several state laws allowing same-sex marriages. For Latinos who at times are frustrated with both political parties, and other obstacles, O'Keefe said the big week for LGBT rights was not unnoticed. ""They are modeling this a lot on what the gay rights movement has done over the past two decades,"" said O'Keefe. ""Obviously they had a very good week. The hope is to accelerate that and potentially make some gains in the next few cycles."" 4. Rand Paul goes to Ferguson and promises he is a different kind of Republican . Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul spends a lot of time and energy promising to expand the Republican tent, and trying to prove wrong skeptics in the African-American community who cite, among other things, past statements questioning provisions of the landmark Civil Rights Act. This past week, he was off to Ferguson, Missouri, and Nia-Malika Henderson of The Washington Post reported on why Paul wanted to make the trip and how it fit into his larger strategy. ""What's going to be interesting to see from Rand Paul is if these are conversations that he continues,"" said Henderson. ""Part of it is he obviously wants to expand the Republican Party, but he's also got the challenge of whether or not he's going to be a leader in his own party on moving that party, not only in talking about criminal justice reform, but also in talking about race and racism and discrimination."" 5. TV time scarce, so GOP allies look for digital ad platforms to target Libertarians . Pro-Republican super PACs are nervous that several Libertarian candidates in key Senate races are shaping up as spoilers, and they are looking to find ways to peel off some of their support. But they are also encountering a problem: TV ad time is scarce in the final three weeks of the campaign, especially in the big battleground states. North Carolina is one of the biggest concerns. Most GOP strategists believe that if the election were held today, Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan would win, in part because of support for Libertarian candidate Sean Haugh. So the Chamber of Commerce and other groups are looking for ways to try to boost Republican Thom Tillis by taking after Haugh. But with TV time so scarce, the effort has forced a search for digital advertising platforms. And more old-school tactics also are likely to be added to the mix: phone banks and direct mail.","Bill Clinton plans two trips back to Arkansas before midterms .

"Washington (CNN) -- The chairmen of the House and Senate Veterans Affairs committees have reached a tentative agreement on a bill to reform the VA health system, aides to each of the men said Sunday, just days before Congress is scheduled to leave on its August recess. The deal, which still needs to be approved by both chambers, is expected to address both short- and long-term needs at the department, which was rocked by a waiting list scandal earlier this year. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, and Rep Jeff Miller, R-Florida, scheduled a Monday news conference to outline their agreement. A news release for that event said ""Miller and Sanders continued negotiations this weekend and made significant progress on legislation to make the VA more accountable and recruit more doctors, nurses and other health care professionals."" A separate House Veterans Committee source confirmed a deal â€” but also declined to give the dollar amount. The Department of Veterans Affairs, a massive bureaucracy with more than 300,000 full-time employees, is under fire as it deals with allegations of alarming shortcomings at its medical facilities. The controversy, as CNN first reported, involves delayed care with potentially fatal consequences in possibly dozens of cases. Eric Shinseki stepped down as head of the department in May after Republicans, Democrats and veterans' advocacy groups joined in calling for his resignation. Bob McDonald, a West Point graduate and former CEO of Procter & Gamble, was tapped to become the troubled department's new head. At the Veterans Affairs medical center in Phoenix, for example, a preliminary report made public in May indicated at least 1,700 military veterans waiting to see a doctor were never scheduled for an appointment and were never placed on a wait list. CNN has reported that in Phoenix, the VA used fraudulent record-keeping -- including an alleged secret list -- that covered up excessive waiting periods for veterans, some of whom died in the process. But the problems go well beyond Phoenix. Dozens of others of VA centers, all around the country, also face a host of allegations like possible abuse of scheduling practices. ""It is clear that there are significant and chronic systemic failures that must be addressed by the leadership at VA,"" said a report last month prepared by Rob Nabors, President Obama's deputy chief of staff.

"(CNN) -- The heat wave that's bearing down on more than 150 million Americans in the Midwestern and mid-Atlantic United States is also straining the nation's power grid. The record temperatures and heat indexes mean more and more people are cranking on the air conditioners.  Many regional electricity providers are reporting record usage this week. Read the latest on the heat wave . In May, the power grid serving most of the mid-Atlantic region predicted a peak demand of just under 149,000 megawatts (one megawatt can run 1,000 air-conditioning units at full power). On Wednesday, that grid produced more than 150,000 megawatts. CNN's Randi Kaye talked with Michael Kormos, an operations executive with Philadelphia-based PJM Interconnection, which serves 58 million customers in 13 states and the District of Columbia, who said his utility is well-prepared for the increase in demand. CNN: How is your company doing in terms of providing power to its customers? Do you have enough? Kormos: Yes, at this point, we believe that there is adequate capacity to serve all of the customer needs on the grid at this point. CNN: Give us an idea of the situation: Are you at peak capacity, or do you have room here to play with? Kormos: While we are at peak, this is the kind of week that we literally plan years for in advance to make sure the infrastructure's in place.  We train all year long to be prepared and everything is running well, and the grid is holding up, and we expect not to have any brownouts in the foreseeable future. CNN: What type of training do you do to avoid a brownout? Kormos: A lot of the training is being able to react to any situation that could happen on the grid, should a generator fail or a transmission line or transformer fail, being able to react to that, to redirect the power to ensure that the remaining of the grid stays up. CNN: What if you do need more power? Is there anything you can do? Kormos: We do have emergency procedures, as just mentioned. We can use what's called a brownout, where we lower the voltage that does decrease the power use. We also have the ability to ask customers, to either voluntarily or through contractual obligations, get off the grid at that point. CNN: I've read that as a heat wave persists, it takes more and more power to maintain cool temperatures. Is that true? Kormos: Yes, that's true. You normally end up with residual heat buildup in the buildings, and therefore the air conditioners are working harder to maintain the same temperature because of that residual heat.","The U.S. heat wave is affecting 150 million Americans .

"New York (CNN) -- A U.S. citizen has been arrested in the Times Square bombing probe, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced early Tuesday. Faisal Shahzad was arrested at JFK airport in New York as he prepared to board a flight to Dubai, Holder said. ""It is clear the intent behind this terrorist act was to kill Americans,"" Holder said. ""We will not rest until we bring everyone responsible to justice."" Law enforcement officials said the suspect is the person who bought the Nissan Pathfinder used in the bombing attempt. Earlier, a law enforcement official said the buyer is a naturalized U.S. citizen from Pakistan, and that investigators are looking at more than one person in connection with the unsuccessful bombing. CNN has learned that the Joint Terrorism Task Force investigating the bombing attempt is considering the possibility that the attempt involved more than just a ""lone wolf."" According to a source familiar with the investigation, investigators believe the plan was an intended terrorist attack to set off explosives in the heart of midtown Manhattan on Saturday night, but the individuals didn't have the expertise to detonate their device. The Nissan Pathfinder had been sold three weeks ago in a cash deal with no paperwork exchanged, a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN earlier Monday. The $1,800 deal was closed at a Connecticut shopping mall, where the buyer handed over the money and drove off, the source said. The seller described the buyer as a man in his late 20s to early 30s, and investigators are checking into phone records between the two, the source said. A bomb made up of propane tanks, fertilizer and gasoline failed to detonate inside the SUV. New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said the device could have produced ""a significant fireball"" in the heart of Midtown Manhattan on Saturday night had it detonated properly. Earlier, authorities said they were searching for two people they wanted to question in connection with the would-be bomb. A video obtained from a tourist in the area shows a person apparently running north on Broadway, while another video shows a balding man with dark hair removing a shirt and putting it in a bag before walking out of view of the camera, which was inside a restaurant. ""These are not suspects,"" Kelly said. ""These are people we would like to speak to."" The question of who was behind the failed bomb attempt was the subject of intense scrutiny Monday. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said investigators have some ""good leads,"" but he declined to elaborate. And Kelly said it was ""too early to say"" whether the attempt was carried out by a lone wolf, international terrorists, or any other type of network. Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud appeared on a video released less than 24 hours after the attempt, claiming Taliban fighters were prepared to inflict ""extremely painful blows"" in major U.S. cities. But a senior U.S. military official said there was no ""credible evidence"" at the early stages of the investigation that the Pakistani Taliban was responsible for the Times Square bomb incident. And one counterintelligence official told CNN there was no evidence of any communications among terrorist organizations overseas about the device after Saturday night's attempt. ""People overseas were not giving high fives ... or saying anything about the bomb not working,"" the official said. ""There is no indication that there was that kind of tie."" Another U.S. official with direct awareness of the latest U.S. understanding of the incident said the Pakistani group has never shown ""trans-national capabilities"" like other groups, such as al Qaeda. But such a possibility is ""not something one can rule out at this early stage,"" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the information. But Pakistan's Taliban movement has been linked to a 2008 plot to blow up subway stations in the Spanish city of Barcelona, and at least two of the 11 men convicted in the plot came to Barcelona from Pakistan, Spanish prosecutors said. And Jim Cavanaugh, a former agent with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said the bomber could have been ""internationally inspired,"" but the device showed little sign that a group like al Qaeda was behind it. ""Their bombs would be better funded, better fused, better materials, better knowledge,"" he said. The device inside the Pathfinder was made up of propane tanks, gasoline and fertilizer that turned out to be of a non-explosive grade, along with a metal pot containing wiring and firecrackers. More firecrackers were found in a can on the back seat of the vehicle, sandwiched between two full, five-gallon gasoline cans and connected by wires to clocks. Cavanaugh called the bomb ""a Rube Goldberg contraption"" that would have been difficult to set off. ""That does not mean that the bomb's not deadly,"" he said. Someone close by could be hurt or killed. ""But it's not a very reliable working system, a fusing and firing system, at all,"" he told CNN. Kevin Barry, a former New York bomb squad member, said the device had ""no known signature"" -- a style of construction that might link it to known terrorist groups. That suggests it was the work of either an individual or a new organization, said Barry, who is now an adviser to the International Association of Bomb Technicians and Investigators. Barry said the detonating mechanism lacked the energy needed to properly set off the explosion. New York police have been examining the device for clues such as fingerprints, hair and fibers since Saturday. The vehicle and bomb components were taken to the FBI's forensic laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, on Monday, FBI spokesman Richard Kolko said Monday evening. CNN's Deborah Feyerick, Susan Candiotti, Barbara Starr, Jeanne Meserve, Kathleen Johnston and Terry Frieden contributed to this report.","NEW: Faisal Shahzad was arrested at JFK airport in New York .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- The guards at the Baghdad detention facility called their prisoner ""Vic,"" and let him plant a little garden near his cell. The cell where Saddam Hussein spent his final days is furnished with the basics. The rest of the world knew him as Saddam Hussein, a man blamed for the death of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis during more than 20 years as the country's president. The nickname and the garden are among the details about the former Iraqi dictator that emerged during a tour of the Baghdad cell where Hussein slept, bathed, and kept a journal in the final days before he was executed in December 2006. U.S. Marine Maj. Gen. Doug Stone, who oversees detention operations for the U.S. military in Iraq, shared excerpts from the journal and showed CNN the cell -- the first time it's been recorded on video. Hussein was hanged on December 30, 2006, for his role in the killings of 148 people in a town north of Baghdad after a 1982 attempt to assassinate him.  Watch Stone tell how Hussein prepared for execution » . Stone described how Hussein began that day. ""So he got up. He was informed that, in fact, [this] would be the day that he would be going to the execution. He bathed himself here in a very modest manner,""  Stone said, pointing to the sink in the corner of the room. ""It was winter, so it was cold."" Hussein took extra time to put on the familiar dark suit he always wore to court, Stone recalled. ""As he went out, he said goodbye to the guards and then got into the vehicles and proceeded to the execution,"" the general said.  See timeline of events leading up to Hussein's execution » . Notes taken by the guards assigned to Hussein said he asked them to give his belongings to his lawyer and tell his daughter he was going to meet God with a clear conscience, as a soldier sacrificing himself for Iraq and his people. The cell is a small, windowless room painted a nondescript beige, with a gun-metal gray floor and concrete sleeping platform. It has a stainless-steel combination sink and toilet in the corner. Those guarding the former Iraqi leader developed a sort of rapport with him, giving Hussein the nickname Vic -- derived from the initials V-I-C posted near his name in the holding facility. ""Why did you all call him Vic?"" asked CNN's Kyra Phillips. ""Ah, a little-known secret,"" Stone said. ""When he came here there was a debate. Do you call him Mr. President? No, that doesn't sound very good. What do you call him?"" Hussein also had a prisoner number, but that wasn't going to work as a name either. ""One day he looked across at us and said why do you have initials by my name?"" Stone said. ""And we said, well, that stands for 'Very Important Criminal'"" ... and he said, 'OK, that's what I want to be called.'"" Guards allowed Hussein to exercise and keep a garden in a small outdoor courtyard. ""This was probably his favorite area,"" Stone said of the courtyard, where Hussein also smoked cigars and wrote in his journal, trying to shape his legacy even though he had lost control of the country. In his writings, Hussein said it was his responsibility to document history so that ""the people ... may know the facts as they are and not as those who want to counterfeit it."" ""So he is afraid that history will not be recorded as he wants it recorded?"" Phillips asked. ""As he wants it recorded, exactly!"" Stone said. The former Iraqi leader showed a philosophical side in his poetry. ""The nights are darker after the sunset, but the smoke and the burning overwhelms the city,"" Hussein wrote as bombings and fighting enveloped Baghdad and echoed into the prison. ""You will feel suffocated under its skies. The days are now nights. No stars. No moon, but lots of screams."" In another piece, Hussein called on citizens to change. ""Dear nation: Get rid of the hatred, take the clothes of hate and throw it into the ocean of hatred,"" he wrote. ""God will save you and you will start a clean life, with a clean heart."" Though authorities executed Hussein for his role in killing about 150 people, he was on trial at the time of his death for genocide. Those charges implicated him in the killings of up to 100,000 Kurds during the 1988 Anfal campaign against Kurdish rebels -- a campaign that included the use of poison gas against Kurdish towns in northern Iraq. Stone said Hussein's poetry may have been another attempt to ensure his legacy. ""There is a certain cunningness to him,"" Stone said. ""There's a desire to sort of piece things together so that this is what you'll remember.""","CNN shoots first video inside Saddam Hussein's cell, gets a look at his journal .

"(CNN) -- In their first year at Yale Law School, many of the students who would graduate  in 1979 were nervous about raising their hands. They often felt intimidated by their professors and complained to one another outside of class. Sonia Sotomayor is pictured in the 1978-79 yearbook of Yale University Law School. But not the confident, outspoken Sonia Sotomayor, classmates recall. ""She was always willing to speak up and give her point of view,"" said classmate Robert Klonoff, now dean of the Lewis and Clark Law School in Portland, Oregon. ""I just remember, even back then, thinking that in a group of very, very smart people she was destined to go great places."" Sotomayor, who was nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday, has been described as a studious, outgoing person by classmates from her class at Yale. ""At a time when other students were sitting around worrying about workload, she was doing the work,"" said Stephen Carter, who attended Yale Law School with Sotomayor and now is a professor there. Classmates noted that Sotomayor's background was not typical for a Yale Law student. While many other students had come from wealthy backgrounds and had parents who attended the university, Sotomayor grew up in a housing project in the South Bronx in New York. She then attended Princeton University on a scholarship, graduating summa cum laude in 1976. Her background didn't seem to shake her confidence, classmates said. And she did not use her experience of hardship as leverage in arguments, Carter said. ""She would never sit around and say, 'Oh, well, I grew up in a housing project so I know,' "" he said. ""She didn't feel her background gave her some kind of special trump. She wanted the argument to work. She would tell you why she thought something, and the 'why' never had anything to do with where she came from."" Sotomayor's emphasis on opportunities for people of color has been instrumental in Klonoff's own thinking, he said. ""As dean, I'm very passionate about diversifying my law faculty and diversifying the student body,"" he said. ""She was very influential in my own thinking on that, on the importance of those values."" Sotomayor demonstrates passions for the law and questions of justice, said Susan Sturm, a Columbia Law School professor and classmate of Sotomayor at Yale. The two women still keep in touch, Sturm said. ""She's someone who really respects and admires the law as an institution and, within that, the law's capacity to really respond to concerns running the spectrum of people who are currently disadvantaged and those who have responsibilities,"" Sturm said. Outside of class, Sotomayor served as an editor of the Yale Law Journal. Several of her classmates remember a note she published in the journal about whether Puerto Rico would lose its rights to offshore minerals if it became a U.S. state. Carter was impressed by her use of an old doctrine of constitutional law in her analysis -- she looked at its roots, its reasoning, and the best way of crafting exceptions to it.  Learn more about Sotomayor's life » . ""Her work was thorough, dogged, careful and persuasive; steeped in legal sources and attentive to real-world consequences,"" said Martha Minow, now a professor at Harvard Law School, in an e-mail. She and Minow were classmates and remain friendly, she said. Sotomayor's later opinions as a judge on the court of appeals reflect some of the same qualities seen in that note, particularly the idea of finding a practical, ""in-between"" solution to a problem, Carter said. ""She looks and she says, 'I understand a lot of people think A, and a lot of people Z, but if you look at this carefully the real answer is somewhere between those,' "" he said. ""And indeed what she does in finding these in-between answers is she applies a practical sense, the sense of someone who has been a courtroom lawyer."" Today, Carter teaches some of Sotomayor's business law opinions in his courses. Her continued emphasis on finding practical solutions is refreshing in a world where public discussions about law are usually about ""good guys and bad guys,"" he said.  Learn about the other Supreme Court justices » . ""'Good guys and bad guys' is a wretched way to pick judges and it's a wretched way to make law. Thinking about what works practically is a much finer way to make law, and I think that's what you'll find Sonia doing."" The choice of Sotomayor for the Supreme Court seemed so appropriate to Klonoff that, upon learning Justice David Souter was stepping down, Klonoff wrote a letter to the President's Council urging that she be nominated. ""Given her life experience, I think she's going to have a sensitivity that many others couldn't bring to the job,"" said Klonoff, who also still keeps in touch with Sotomayor. ""This was a master stroke for the president, I think, on so many levels, and not only to have the first Latin-American on the court, but to pick someone with absolutely impeccable credentials and experience, and to have both the trial and appellate experience,"" Klonoff said. ""She's really smart, intellectually brilliant, she's street smart which is a nice thing to be, in my view, if you're a judge,"" said Rudy Aragon, now an attorney in Miami, Florida, and classmate of Sotomayor. He and Sotomayor were co-chairs of LANA, the Latin, Asian, and Native American student association at the law school. He also said that Sotomayor's mother saved up all her money to buy a set of encyclopedias so her kids could learn. Personally, Sotomayor is ""warm, funny, and down-to-earth,"" said Harvard professor Minow. The judge is a ""born teacher"" with an attentiveness to detailed facts, she said. ""She has never forgotten where she came from, nor how challenging life can be for people struggling to make it in this country,"" she said.","Sonia Sotomayor graduated Yale University Law School in 1979 .

"(CNN) -- Newly released text messages reportedly from the morning of September 11, 2001, show panicked family members trying to contact loved ones and officials frantically trying to grasp what was happening. More than half a million messages, released by whistleblower site Wikileaks, reveal the panic, horror and pain of what happened that morning in the words of those who experienced it. On September 11, 2001, 19 hijackers commandeered four commercial jetliners, loaded with fuel for cross-country flights. Two were flown into the World Trade Center's Twin Towers in New York, one crashed into the Pentagon, and another, headed for an unknown location, crashed in Pennsylvania when it was disrupted by passengers. A total of 2,976 people -- not including the hijackers -- were killed in the attacks. Some people witnessing the attacks reached out to loved ones out of fear there might have been more attacks coming and they might die. ""The only thoughts I have are of Nicholas, Ian and you,"" read one text message. ""I am terrified. I needed to tell you that I truly love you. always, diane."" ""I want to hold you now,"" one text message a minute later reads. ""I know you have a new relationship and do not care about me. But just in case anything happens know I love you hon. Missed Ya good bye."" The first indication of a problem comes at 8:50 a.m., five minutes aft.er the first plane hit the World Trade Center. ""An aloha call is starting. This is for a fire at 2wt ..."" Another text message references ""a bomb detonation"" in the World Trade Center and asks recipients of the message to report back assessments of their areas. A minute later, firsthand reports started flooding in. ""The world trade center has just blow up, we seen the explosion outside our windows. Teresa ..."" At 8:53 a.m. a message from the New York Police Department's operations division mobilizes officers toward the World Trade Center, telling them to meet at Church and Vessey streets. At 9:03 a.m. the second plane hit the World Trade Center. ""It's a deliberate attack ... a second plane just few into the second tower,"" a message said 52 seconds later. By 9:25 a.m. the personal messages have grown more frequent and more frantic. Companies begin sending out messages asking for head counts on all employees. People begin sharing reports of what they are seeing and hearing on TV,­ including early reports of people jumping from the World Trade Center. Family members panicked, struggling to get through jammed phone lines to find out if their loved ones were OK. 9:25:40 a.m. ""Please call my work as soon as you get in the office. Need to know you're safe."" 9:29:38 a.m. ""Wondering where you are. Are you okay. Give me a call back asap. I just need to know these things. Even if it's collect. Call me. Darryl"" 11:32:56 a.m. ""if i do not hear from you by high noon, i am going to pick laura up at school and tell her her father is dead."" ""goodbye my sweety.....im going to miss yo,"" another said. ""Honey wanted to tell you how much i love you,"" one sender wrote. ""I was a little worried. I Don't want to lose you now that I got you back. You mean everything to me. You have my whole heart and life. I love you so much."" Some texts brought relief. ""My dad survived! I got a call from stepmom's coworker saying my dad is alive, although that is all the info I have. I do not know if he is injured or unscathed."" ""Abroer's father is alive,"" one text proclaims. ""survived WTC collapse. I am trying to contact family members to find out more."" ""urgent. It's tim. I'm okay. Call me at home...i was outside the building when it exploded, but i'm fine."" Others have to wait and worry. Numerous messages simply read: ""Are you okay?"" ""Where are you?"" or ""CALL ME NOW!"" ""pete is ok. He can't find his brother who works in the world financial center next to the trade center....."" one message read. The messages also give insight to the federal government's scramble to evacuate buildings, bases and high-level officials. ""Jim: DEPLOY TO MT. WEATHER NOW! Tom"" reads one message, referring to Mount Weather, the underground bunker where high-level officials are taken in a national emergency and a command facility for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. A message at 10:24 a.m. appears to show authorities working to secure the first family. ""TWINKLE AND TURQ ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AND SAFE,"" the message says. Twinkle and Turquoise were the code names used for then-president George W. Bush's twin daughters Jenna and Barbara. At 10:32 a.m. a Secret Service message said ""ANONYMOUS CALL TO JOC REPORTING ANGEL IS TARGET"" -- referring to a call to the Joint Operation's Center refering a threat made against Air Force One, which used a code name of Angel. A message from FEMA at 12:37 p.m. notes ""we have no mission statements yet."" A message from the Secret Service's New York field office sent conflicting messages about where agents should report. The messages also frantically pass along reports of more attacks. Some turned out to be rumors, others real. Rumors were rampant: . ""There is a hijacked plane circling dulles airport. Please call me!"" ""unconfirmed reports of plane crash at camp david now."" ""think one more plane may have been hijacked and headed toward the capitol building...not sure."" Wikileaks says it has verified some of the texts and says they all appear to be authentic. ""I fully understand that this is very emotional material, but this does not mean that this is not part of our historic record,"" said spokesman Daniel Schmitt. ""And from the publishing perspective of the Wikileaks perspective, that is what counts. We are helping to maintain an uncensorable part of this day's record in more detail than has ever been provided before.""

"New York (CNN) -- The attorney for a family who filed a wrongful death lawsuit in the death of Mark Bavis, 31 -- who died in the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks -- says new court documents offer a glimpse into airport security lapses that made the attacks possible. Security screeners at Boston's Logan International Airport allegedly had trouble communicating in English, were unable to detect weapons -- such as a chemical spray called Mace -- and were operating under a general manager who was unaware of the al-Qaeda terrorist threat. ""What it came down to that day was that entities did not do their job,"" said Mary Schiavo, attorney for the Bavis family. Mark Bavis, a hockey scout aboard United Airlines Flight 175, died when his flight crashed into the World Trade Center's south tower. ""This suit is not about money, it never has been,"" Schiavo added. ""It's about accountability."" Thousands of families received monetary compensation following legal settlements involving 9/11 victims. The documents were filed in Manhattan federal court in a lawsuit against United Airlines, a private security company and Massachusetts Port Authority -- which owns and operates Logan airport. The defendants say they are not liable for the attacks. Massport spokesman Matthew Brelis declined to comment on the case, but his agency in May filed a motion to dismiss, saying ""Mr. Bavis's tragic death was not due to the breach of any security layer for which Massport had authority or responsibility under federal law."" In the filing, Massport claims the Federal Aviation Administration regulations for screening passengers and their baggage was not the responsibility of airports but the airlines. A spokesman for United Airlines declined comment. Schiavo maintains that the airline ""had exclusive control over its aircraft and over security procedures"" and are ultimately responsible for the safety of its passengers. The trial date is set for November 7.","Court papers provide evidence of negligence in 9/11 lawsuit, attorney says .

"Miami (CNN) -- ""No queremos ir pa' Cuba!"" We don't want to go to Cuba. Those words were repeatedly sung by a young man in his mid-20s, who had just risked his life to escape the communist island. Instead, he found himself, along with nine other Cuban men, lying on the deck of the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Margaret Norvell. The eyes of all 10 filled with desperation and sadness. They knew they were going back. On this night, the Norvell received the men from another cutter, less than 10 miles off Key West, Florida. In the distance, they could see the lights of the land of freedom they hoped to reach. But, like many before them, they would be quickly processed and repatriated. This is a different front line of the immigration crisis: the Florida Straits, a 90-mile-long stretch of open water between the Florida Keys and Cuba. On one side, the Bahamas. On the other, the Gulf of Mexico. And, in between, an alarming increase in the number of people -- mostly Cubans and Haitians -- using makeshift rafts and boats in an attempt to reach America. In fiscal year 2014, which ended September 30, the U.S. Coast Guard 7th District, which patrols this area, saw the highest number of migrants in five years, with 10,126 people found on land and sea. That's over 3,000 more than the previous year. ""Most of it is economic. They're looking for a better way of life,"" said Lt. Kirk Fistick, commanding officer of the Norvell. More attempts, new routes . For some of those caught and returned, it's just the latest chapter in their long journey to freedom. CNN learned one of the Cuban men on the Norvell was on his ninth attempt at crossing the Florida Straits. ""There are people that have done this dozens of times,"" said Fistick. And, since 2012, the Coast Guard says it has seen human smugglers use new routes to get migrants to America -- namely, by avoiding Florida altogether. In Cuba's case, people on the island now have more freedom to visit other countries. So, an increasing number of Cubans are legally flying to smaller Caribbean islands near the U.S. Virgin Islands, then smugglers are bringing them over to the tiny American territory. ""That's a very short maritime distance. And so, it's tough to combat that,"" said Capt. Mark Fedor, the chief of response for the Coast Guard 7th District. For Haitians, the new routes are longer and more dangerous. ""There are organized smugglers that will try to lure them from Haiti through the Dominican Republic, and then into Puerto Rico. That never happened really, before 2012. And now, that vector accounts for 40% of all the Haitians leaving Haiti,"" said Fedor. Doing more with less . When it comes to dealing with migrants, the Coast Guard is in a unique position. Part of the agency's mission is humanitarian. But, unlike the other military branches, the Coast Guard, which now resides within the Department of Homeland Security, also has federal law enforcement responsibilities. In that capacity, it also serves as the lead agency in charge of stopping human and drug smugglers in open waters. And, along the Florida Straits, it's not an easy task. ""There are organized smugglers here, especially human traffickers -- the lowest of the low, when it comes to trafficking. It could be kids, women caught up in the sex trade. They're moving people any way they can to try to get them in the United States,"" Fedor said. He said it can get frustrating to deal with these multiple missions, with such limited resources. In a recent summary released online, the Coast Guard's budget is expected to be about $6.7 billion for the 2015 fiscal year -- a fraction of what other military branches receive. ""We try to do the best we can to be creative, to be nimble and to try to be one step ahead of these smugglers. But it's a challenge, because they're thinking the same way. They're running a for-profit, multimillion-dollar business, so they have a lot of incentive to get their product to market, whether it's drugs or people."" 'This is what we do' Ronald Garcia, 33, is on the crew of the Norvell. The 13-year Coast Guard veteran is also the son of Cuban immigrants, who came to the United States in 1979. ""They did everything they could to come and have children in the United States, and provide better opportunities for us. I'm able to live the American dream."" Garcia is one of two Cuban-Americans on the cutter. They both admit, at times, it's hard to separate their jobs from their personal connections to the plight of the migrants they find. ""It's a very difficult thing to deal with. Personally, it's just difficult for me to see the situation they're in,"" said Garcia. It's a reality that's not lost on his fellow crew members, including the commanding officer, Fistick. ""We empathize with them and it's tough on the human spirit to do it. But, we're in the military. We follow orders. This is what we do.""","Florida Straits are 90-mile-long stretch of open water between the Florida Keys, Cuba .

"(CNN) -- If you are reading this on a tablet, smart phone or computer monitor, then you may be holding a product of forced labor. Verité's two-year study of labor conditions in electronics manufacturing in Malaysia has found that one in three foreign workers surveyed was in a condition of forced labor. Because many of the most recognizable brands source components of their products from Malaysia, almost any device you purchase may have come in contact with modern-day slavery. Many customers have never heard the stories that most of the migrant workers living in Malaysia can recite by heart. One such story goes like this. In 2011, a Nepali man named Bishal (not his real name) applied for a job with a Malaysian electronics company. He was told he could only be employed if he first paid a $1,266 fee -- about double the average annual income in Nepal. Since Bishal didn't have savings, he borrowed the funds from a moneylender at a monthly interest rate of 5%, using his family land as collateral. After calculating the promised monthly salary, he was confident he would be able to pay back the loan and save money to send home for his family. When he arrived in Malaysia, Bishal was faced with additional fees and realized he'd been deceived about his salary. After purchasing food and transport, he had about $90 left over each month to pay down the loan and send home to his family. This will be Bishal's reality for the two years that he estimates it will take him to pay off his loan. The debt isn't the only thing keeping Bishal in Malaysia. He was also forced to surrender his passport to his Malaysian employment manager. He cannot leave. He is a modern-day slave. And he is not alone. For the past two years, Verité has met with workers in the Malaysian electronics sector, collecting 500 of their stories. These laborers work long hours in poor conditions to produce the components for the electronic devices bought and sold on the U.S. and European markets. Many of them become heavily indebted to obtain their jobs, and then work between one and two years in conditions of virtual debt bondage to pay off their recruitment fees. The workers we spoke with are often stuck in the supply chains of major brands that you would instantly recognize. Electronics is Malaysia's leading manufacturing industry and a key driver of the economy, contributing to 33% of exports and generating 27% of all jobs in 2013. Many companies from the U.S., Europe, and Asia use Malaysia as their manufacturing base. Foreign investment in the industry is extremely high, with 87% (roughly $2.6 billion) originating from foreign sources in 2013. Businesses and consumers worldwide share in the shame of Malaysia's forced labor problem. This new and conclusive evidence of forced labor ought to disturb major electronics companies that outsource their production to Malaysia. As stewards of international trade with the ability to influence global policy and affect consumer behavior, these companies have the power and responsibility to push for meaningful reforms and combat forced labor in the countries that supply their products. While the factors underlying modern-day slavery in Malaysia are complex, the solutions are at hand. First and foremost, multinational companies must implement strict policies to ensure that workers in their supply chains have not paid fees to get jobs and that they have easy access to their identity documents throughout their employment. To do this, multinational companies must extend their current social assessments to include inquiries about worker debt and passport retention. They must ensure that recruiters reimburse any illegal fees they have collected from workers. Companies must also conduct due diligence on the business practices of recruiters who find, place or otherwise manage workers in their suppliers' facilities. Forced labor is prohibited by the internal codes of conduct of virtually all multinationals, yet it is common in the supply chains of the most sophisticated businesses in the world. No multinational company intentionally relies on exploitation as part of its business model, yet many overlook forced labor practices that would shock their consumers. Some companies have addressed the problem, including by strictly limiting fees and even reimbursing workers for overcharges. But it's clear that we need a much larger, industry-wide effort. It's time that multinational electronics companies took strict, comprehensive and measurable steps to put forced labor in Malaysia and other countries out of business.","Workers are being lured to work in factories producing electronic goods but have to pay a fee to secure the job.
After that they are in debt and have to work to pay it off, sometimes being forced to surrender travel documents.
Malaysia is a major manufacturer of electronics but supply chains are not properly regulated, says Dan Viederman of Verité.
He wants all companies to end forced labor in their supply chains."
"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A crowd gathered Thursday for an emotional funeral in Manhattan's St. Thomas Church, where hundreds paid their respects to three young girls who died in a house fire in Stamford, Connecticut, on Christmas Day. ""My girls are in my heart,"" Madonna Badger, the girls' mother, told a room full of mourners in a brief reading at the midtown church. ""They are right here,"" she said, referring to her heart during the hourlong service. ""This is where they live now."" The family of Lily, 10, and 7-year-old twins Grace and Sarah Badger -- who died in the fire along with their grandparents, Lomer and Pauline Johnson -- held a private service Wednesday. ""Nothing, not even death, will separate you from the love that Lily, Sarah and Grace brought to this life,"" said William Shillady of the United Methodist City Society. The fire, which broke out around 5 a.m. Christmas Day in a three-story Victorian home, is believed to have been caused by smoldering embers removed from a fireplace, according to Stamford Chief Fire Marshal Barry Callahan. Authorities said that Lomer Johnson fell through the roof rafters outside a window. One of the children's bodies was found just inside the window. It appeared that Johnson was trying to get the child out, but died after climbing through the window, acting Fire Chief Antonio Conte said. The medical examiner's office said Johnson suffered from smoke inhalation in addition to trauma from the fall. The girls' mother and a friend escaped the blaze. CNN affiliate WFSB reported that Badger attempted to climb the renovation scaffolding outside the home in an apparent attempt to reach her family. Authorities said it was unclear whether the home had working smoke detectors. The city of Stamford later razed the three-story home, which was under renovation, after determining it was unsafe.","NEW: A public funeral is held in Manhattan's St. Thomas Church .

"(CNN) -- Canadians feared this day, hoping it would never come but also knowing the odds probably weren't in their favor, either. Not in this era of senseless gun violence, homegrown jihadists and terrorist organizations with international reach. On Wednesday, a gunman opened fire in the heart of the Canadian capital, shattering a nation's sense of security. There are unanswered questions: What prompted the attack? Is there a link to terrorism? Whatever the answers, one thing is clear: As one resident put it, ""Canada lost its innocence today."" This is how it unfolded. Chaos in the nation's capital . It begins at Canada's National War Memorial. 9:52 a.m.: . A blaze of gunfire erupts at the solemn National War Memorial in Ottawa. Two soldiers are standing guard. One of them is gunned down. ""I heard four shots,"" says Peter Henderson, a journalist. ""I turned around and ran, and I saw one of those soldiers laying on the ground."" The shots sound like they come from a high-powered rifle, Henderson says. Other witnesses describe the shooter as a man with dark hair and a scarf on his head. They say he's carrying a ""huge rifle."" Strangers and emergency personnel rush to the soldier's aid as the gunman runs away. At least one witness says the shooter commandeers a car at gunpoint and leaves the scene. The action quickly shifts to Parliament Hill, just a quarter-mile away. Parliament Hill . Shortly before 10 a.m.: . Witnesses report a gunman entering the main Parliament building through an entrance meant for government officials. He exchanges gunfire with security officers. ""I heard rapid fire of what appeared to be 20 shots or more, very loud, appeared to be very close,"" says Kevin Lamoureux, a member of Parliament. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper is holding a meeting at the time. He is quickly escorted, along with some members of Parliament, to a safe location, but dozens of others remain inside on lockdown. MPs and Parliament staff barricade themselves in rooms throughout the building. The wait . Within minutes, the shooting is over, according to Josh Wingrove, a reporter with The Globe and Mail newspaper who was at Parliament when it began. He sees a body outside the Library of Parliament. Locked behind closed doors, government officials wait while police clear the building and make sure there are no other gunmen inside. They take to Twitter to keep friends and family posted on developments. MP Michelle Rempel tweets to let her mom know she's OK. Sen. Jim Munson describes the harrowing experience. ""Everyone safe but shaken ... mp's say they could smell gunpowder,"" he tweets. Although Wingrove sees the body in a hallway, it will be hours before official word comes that the gunman is dead, killed by Sergeant at Arms Kevin Vickers. Chaos in downtown Ottawa . 11:22 a.m.: . Ottawa police don't know how many suspects they're looking for. They tell CNN there may have been two or three shooters and the war memorial. Officers flood the area. CBC reporter Chris Goldrick tells CNN that authorities believe there's another gunman at large and on the run. 11:40 a.m.: . There's word of yet another possible shooting, police say. This one is just a seven-minute walk from Parliament, near the city's Rideau Centre mall. That report is later dismissed. Just before noon: . The U.S. Embassy in Ottawa goes on lockdown. President Barack Obama is briefed on the shooting and pledges Washington's support. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry passes along the message to John Baird, Canada's foreign minister. Minutes later, developments in Ottawa prompt NORAD -- the North American Aerospace Defense Command -- to put its planes on higher alert. ""We stand with you,"" says a statement from Cmdr. Chuck Jacoby. 12:30 p.m.: . The FBI pledges to remain vigilant after recent chatter by ISIS about attacks on Western targets. The Canadian Embassy in Washington is also locked down. Just after 1 p.m.: . News comes that that the Canadian soldier who was shot at the war memorial has died. He's identified as Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, a reservist from Hamilton, Ontario. The suspect . Later in the day, Canadian officials tell their American counterparts that Michael Zehaf-Bibeau is the suspected gunman, multiple U.S. officials told CNN. Zehaf-Bibeau, who was born in 1982, was a convert to Islam and had a history of drug use before he converted, two sources say. His passport had been confiscated by Canadian authorities when they learned he planned to go fight overseas, a U.S. law enforcement official says. The official said it is not clear when that happened. Canadian broadcaster CBC reports that Zehaf-Bibeau had a record of drug arrests going back 10 years. The end of the day . Wednesday closes with lots of uncertainty for the people of Canada, but especially for the residents of Ottawa. Are more attacks planned? Are there any other gunmen on the loose? Still, there are signs of hope and goodwill. In Pittsburgh, the CONSOL Energy Center is bathed in red and maple leaves as the Canadian national anthem plays before the NHL match between the Penguins and the Philadelphia Flyers. Back in Ottawa, MP Rempel reminds those who were shaken by the incident that not all is lost. ""For those wondering, our nation's flag still proudly flew over parliament hill tonight. #CanadaStrong,"" she tweets.

"(CNN) -- Former NFL star Darren Sharper and a friend told other people that they had sex with two women in a New Orleans apartment in September without ""their knowledge or permission,"" an application for an arrest warrant that was released Thursday revealed. Sharper is jailed in Los Angeles, where he faces similar accusations, and is scheduled to attend an extradition hearing on Friday. Prosecutors in New Orleans intend to charge Sharper, 38, and Erik Nunez, 26, on two counts of aggravated rape. If convicted, the two men face a possible sentence of life in prison without parole. Sharper turned himself into Los Angeles authorities last week. His attorneys said after he pleaded not guilty to rape charges in Los Angeles that he maintains that any sex he had with any of his accusers was consensual. The application for the arrest warrant said New Orleans detectives interviewed two women who said they were raped on September 23. The two accusers told police they were so impaired that they don't recall ""the entirety of the sexual intercourse,"" and that they never agreed to have sex. The document describes how a friend came to the apartment and saw Sharper in his underwear and Nunez exiting Sharper's bedroom in just his boxer shorts. Police said through further investigation they found other witness who told them Sharper and Nunez admitted to sexual acts without the women's permission or knowledge. Nunez turned himself in to the Orleans Parish district attorney's office on February 28. The alleged rapes in California occurred in October and last month, authorities said. Prosecutors have said the five-time Pro Bowl player, who was recently fired as an NFL Network analyst, is also under investigation in Arizona, Florida and Nevada. No charges have been filed in those cases. In addition, a Florida woman last month filed a sexual battery complaint in Miami Beach against Sharper relating to a 2012 incident, a police report said. According to the report, the woman was with two friends at a Miami Beach club in September or October 2012 when she met Sharper. The woman, her friends and another person went to Sharper's condo, where the woman claims the battery took place. Miami Beach police are investigating the case, Miami Beach Detective Vivian Hernandez said last month. Sharper played for the Green Bay Packers, Minnesota Vikings and New Orleans Saints from 1997 through the 2010 season. CNN's Tory Dunnan contributed to this story.","Darren Sharper was a five-time all-star in the NFL until he retired in 2010 .

"(CNN) -- It's been two years since Madonna Badger lost her three children and both of her parents in a Christmas Eve house fire. This fall she was finally able to bury her daughters' ashes. It's the kind of tragic loss that strikes people speechless. Badger writes about the horror and healing she experienced in the December issue of Vogue magazine, on newsstands November 19. Almost every morning, she says, she thinks about that night, a Christmas Eve filled with singing, decorating with her girls, feasting on her mother's homemade sugar cookies and wrapping presents late into the evening. She wakes up wondering what she could have done differently. Vogue.com: A writer abandons an unhealthy ritual . The family had seemingly done everything right. A picture-perfect winter holiday had been warmed by a roaring fire in Badger's Victorian house in Stamford, Connecticut, which was undergoing a massive renovation at the time. They swept up the fire's ashes at the end of the night, made sure they were cold, put them in a bin in the mudroom and everyone was in bed by 3:30 am. That's when Badger's life changed in unimaginable ways. She woke up choking on smoke. She opened her bedroom window and climbed the scaffolding outside to her daughter Gracie's bedroom window. She tried to get to her daughters, but the fire was too intense. She remembers being taken off the scaffolding by firefighters and taken to a hospital. Vogue.com: Daniel AlarcÃ³n on his new book, ""At Night We Walk in Circles"" On Christmas Day, a doctor told her that her children were dead and her parents, too. Badger was moved to a psychiatric ward soon after her friends arrived at her bedside. When she was released some days later, she was thrown headlong into her children's funeral. She managed to eulogize her girls, 9-year-old Lily and twins Sarah and Grace, who were 7. ""My girls are in my heart,"" Badger told fellow mourners in Manhattan's St. Thomas Church. ""They are right here. This is where they live now."" The funeral service focused her, Badger says, but two days later, she was suicidal. She was hospitalized again and sought trauma therapy that brought no relief. So she called a college roommate who lived in Little Rock, Arkansas, and begged for help. Her old roommate, Kate Askew, soon came to take Badger home with her. There was one stipulation: Badger had to promise she would not try to kill herself. Vogue.com: The power of Instagram . After nearly a year of therapy and recuperation in Little Rock, Badger decided to return to her life in New York. By then it was once again the holiday season. Badger decided to join a friend on a journey to Thailand, to volunteer at an orphanage. It was one way to escape the pain of Christmas. She brought the girls in this far away place some toys of her daughters' that had survived the fire. Their thanks had a profound effect. ""When I looked into the girls' faces, I saw my children. It broke me open in a way I still can't fully explain,"" Badger writes in Vogue. ""But if these little girls were living their lives with joy and happiness, I realized â€” and if they could give their love to me after all they had been through â€” how could I possibly feel sorry for myself? What they showed me was that what had happened to them had just happened. It wasn't 'done' to them, just as none of this had been 'done' to me. I wasn't being punished; I had not been singled out.""

"(CNN) -- On the off chance you've never been to Iceland's version of the White House, here's what that's like, courtesy of Foreign Affairs deputy editor Stuart Reid: . ""There was incredibly little security,"" Reid told me, describing a 2013 visit for an interview with the country's President. ""I took a taxi to the residence, and the taxi pulled up and I was like, 'OK, now what do I do?' And the taxi driver said, 'Oh, I think you just knock on the door' ... I just go up and ring the doorbell. A butler lets me in. ""I think there was one of those metal check-point gates that can lift up -- that was on a road -- but if you really wanted to you could just drive around it on the grass."" Was there a fence? No. Guards? No. Guns? Nope. And was the door locked? ""I'm not sure whether it was unlocked or locked."" At this point, you may be thinking Iceland's President is the most naive person in the universe, especially in light of the Secret Service scandal in the United States. But I don't see it that way, and neither does Reid. At a time when the U.S. Congress is lining up to take jabs at the Secret Service, which, among other legitimately scandalous things, failed to stop an intruder from making it into the White House East Room, Iceland's no-security state could be seen as a breath of fresh air -- a reminder, as Reid and others have put it, that the president is supposed to be one of the people. ""This is really what the White House is all about. It's the 'People's House,' "" first lady Michelle Obama says in a statement on the White House website. ""It's a place that is steeped in history, but it's also a place where everyone should feel welcome."" ""Should"" is the operative word here. I worry such openness won't continue in the wake of this scandal. A number of White House security ""improvements"" have been proposed by Congress, the news media and the public -- from making the fence around the residence taller to blocking off pedestrian traffic around the building. Currently, anyone can walk up to the White House's wrought iron fence and can see the building across a lawn. This is a popular spot both for tourist photos (I've taken them) and protests. Troublingly, 16 people are reported to have made it past the fence in the last five years, including one toddler. ""While the Secret Service considers creating new fences, large buffer zones and checkpoints around the grounds, they are overlooking a simple, cost-effective solution -- bringing in the United States military,"" Dan Emmett, a retired Secret Service agent, wrote in an op-ed for The Washington Post. The concerns are real. But militarize the White House? I find that shockingly reactionary. Perhaps I shouldn't, though. It is the history. When Andrew Jackson was inaugurated as president in 1829, he famously ""opened up the White House and basically let the rabble in,"" said Jeffrey Engel, director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University. Thousands of ""people trampled through and they didn't even have to wipe their feet. There were reports about how much dirt they had to sweep out afterward."" Since then, Engel told me, ""there's no doubt that we have seen a steady increase in the limitations on public access. At this point (the White House) is a fortress."" There are valid reasons for that. Assassination attempts and security breaches, like those seen this year, are, of course, cause for concern and precaution. But I find it comforting that there are still countries -- including Iceland -- where the president is allowed to remain part of the people. That's a sign of a healthy society. Look, I'm not arguing that the no-one-has-a-gun-and-we-trust-everyone-not-to-shoot-the-president approach that Iceland takes would function in heavily armed America. It wouldn't. Iceland is a country of 320,000 people, which makes it slightly more populous than Anchorage. Its violent crime rate is lower, and there likely are fewer people who would want to assassinate Ã“lafur Ragnar GrÃ­msson, the country's President. For one, he's super nice (he invited me for pancakes when I interviewed him in Maine in 2011). And he's not the most powerful person in the free world -- or arguably in his country. But -- but! -- as our country investigates the White House security breaches, and demands change, it would be wise of us to remember the White House belongs to the American people. The first family should be made safe, but not by raising fences and creating no-go zones around the perimeter of the people's house. I can imagine a dystopian future in which tourists peer through a thick window of yellowed glass -- like at Sea World or something -- to see the presidential residence from beyond a concrete barrier. I certainly don't want to live in that country. ""In an open society, like the United States, or like Iceland, there's this idea that the president is one of the people. He comes from them and he is accountable to them,"" said Reid, the Foreign Affairs editor. ""It would be a shame, in my opinion, if the Secret Service scandal resulted in closing off more public space in D.C. If you actually wanted to protect the president to a totally 100% degree, you would keep expanding the secure zone around the White House evermore. ""But that would come at some cost to the fact that school kids can peer through the fence and see the White House and dream about being president."" Great point. Lawmakers and the first family should keep those kids -- those dreamers standing at the White House fence -- at front of mind as they consider reforms.","Iceland's presidential residence doesn't have a fence or apparent guards .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- OK, so Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's brief summit featured all the enthusiasm of two unhappy schoolboys forced to make up after a schoolyard dust-up. In stark contrast, the meeting between South Korean President Park Geun-hye and Xi was all smiles and banter. But even if they remain reluctant reconcilers, Abe and Xi have started the process of mending fences. While that ""want to be anywhere else"" look in their press photo sparked skepticism about the potential for any improvement in relations, the fact they met at all exceeded expectations. Xi went far beyond the call of obligatory hospitality as APEC host in agreeing to a meeting that Abe has been requesting for almost two years. Agreed to disagree . This face time was facilitated by a joint communiquÃ© released last Friday in which the two sides agreed to disagree and extended each other a ladder to climb down from their uncompromising positions. The statement is a diplomatic papering over of very real differences over a range of issues extending from history to territorial sovereignty. It is thus predictably ambiguous and more about face-saving than substance. It says something about the miserable state of East Asian relations that it took this long to hammer out mutually acceptable language that seems to put the nations closer to the status quo ante when Japan nationalized the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands in September 2012 and sent relations into a tailspin. Since then there have been incidents of saber rattling, radar locking, jet scrambles, incursions by flotillas of trawlers, and Beijing's sudden declaration of an Air Defense Identification Zone. The escalating tensions led to speculation about the possibility of a grave miscalculation at sea or in the air that could provoke war. A hundred years after WWI, more than a few pundits have openly wondered whether it was dÃ©jÃ  vu all over again -- two powers bound by such strong economic relations, making the thought of war so unlikely that they might sleepwalk towards the abyss. Cooler heads . The APEC meeting is the ""cooler heads prevail"" scenario. Both leaders have come to the conclusion that it's time to be pragmatic and try to work on the various problems that divide the leading Asian economies. Nobody can accuse Xi or Abe of pandering to public opinion, although the frostiness on display may have appeased hardliners in both countries. More than 90% of Chinese and Japanese have a negative opinion of each other, with the Japanese recently surging ahead in the animosity sweepstakes. The media has played a key role in this. Anti-Chinese sentiment in newspapers and on television in Japan is amplified on the Internet where armchair nationalists spew their vitriol. In China, wartime depredations by the Japanese are endlessly dramatized, reminding audiences about who the enemy is. I met students in Nanjing and Chengdu who had a wildly warped understanding of Japanese attitudes towards history, assuming that extremist views are the norm. They frequently reminded me that they hate Japan, but when I asked these students if they would like to study in Japan if offered a scholarship, an overwhelming majority told me yes. One suspects that deft public diplomacy can rapidly shift public opinion in both nations. A charm offensive, high level exchanges and a shift in the tenor of media reporting could work wonders. Xi's recently announced ""Asia-Pacific Dream"" probably doesn't apply to Sino-Japanese relations but Monday's brief summit could generate some positive momentum in a relationship that has deteriorated badly in the past few years. Self-righteous nationalism . Both leaders have engaged in counterproductive grandstanding and gestures, embracing a masochistic and self-righteous nationalism that has undermined national interests. But hopefully both men understand that there is too much at stake to continue along this path. Economic relations are the ties that bind, and both nations need each other to maximize their growth potential. To some extent economic ties have been insulated from diplomatic rows and political animus, but there are dispiriting signs that a new generation has come to age in both nations that bear the scars of angry antagonism. Xi and Abe have launched a very fragile process that could easily be derailed or flounder for a lack of political support or a public backlash. It is essential that both sides keep the rhetoric dialed down and shift hot button issues on to the backburner where they can simmer. They also need to move forward with crisis management protocols and mechanisms. They have broken the ice, but it is difficult to anticipate tangible results on divisive issues anytime soon. But to the extent that substance is sacrificed to optics, any thaw will remain limited. While expectations are thus muted, and progress may be slow and fitful, talking is better than some of the alternatives.

"Spring Lake, North Carolina (CNN) -- Taryn Davis says she felt lost and isolated after burying her husband, a 22-year-old Army corporal killed in Iraq four years ago. While she struggled with her grief, it seemed that those around her found it easier to move on with their lives. Other military wives avoided her as though she represented their deepest fears. Family and friends insisted that her youth should provide solace. ""After the funeral, I felt ostracized,"" Davis said. ""Everybody liked to write off my grief due to my young age. They liked to say: 'Well, at least you're young. You'll get remarried.' "" The topic of her husband -- even the mention of his name, Michael -- became taboo. She also struggled with survivor guilt that kept her from seeking happiness and embracing laughter. ""It's hard to laugh and it's hard to smile after a spouse is killed,"" said Davis, 25. ""In a way, you feel bad, because you're like, 'He should be here and have the ability to smile and laugh.' ... In another way, I think once people see you laugh or smile, they're like: 'Oh, she's over him. Great.' "" After her husband's death, the military provided a death gratuity and assisted her with funeral arrangements. She also received recommendations for survivor support groups. Davis researched several of the groups over the Internet but didn't see anyone her age. She was also intimidated by the size of the gatherings -- sometimes hundreds of people at a time. She attended some grief groups near her home in Buda, Texas, but the widows she met there were over 65 years old and not tied to the military. Determined to interact directly with other young war widows and find out how they were handling their grief, Davis reached out to one whose husband was killed alongside Michael. The widow agreed to a visit, and Davis brought along a video camera, filming their emotional encounter and their touching account of memories, love and loss. ""It was the first (military) widow that I was seeing face to face,"" Davis said. ""And for me, it was inspiring ... like, 'Man, if she can get up every day and do this with a child, I can do this. ... I can't let her down.' "" Davis traveled the country interviewing other military widows, compiling six testimonials in her documentary, ""The American Widow Project."" And four months after her husband's death, she started a nonprofit by the same name. To date, the group has connected nearly 800 military widows through its website, which includes an online forum offering support and inspiration. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2011 CNN Heroes . Nearly 3,000 military spouses have been widowed during the global war on terror, according to the U.S. Department of Defense. Davis was convinced that many of them, like her, were searching for a more modern way to connect with other widows. ""Our main form of communication with our husbands (was) Skype and Facebook,"" Davis said. ""The Internet ... it's a safe haven, in a way. ... It lets (the widows participate) at their own pace. ... It allows other women who maybe are kind of afraid to step forward ... (to) be like ... 'You know, they look like me.' "" Social networking is vital to the youth-oriented organization, which connects women from across the country. Each week on its Facebook page, the group hosts ""Memory Mondays,"" where group members can share their favorite memories of their husbands. And on ""Widow Wednesdays,"" a new member's story is posted. Once members feel comfortable, they can start attending events, which take place about every two months in a different city. Small, intimate groups of up to 15 widows meet for a few days, and there's always a fun activity lined up, such as zip-lining, surfing or skydiving. It reflects Davis' resolve to live with the gusto her husband had shown in life. It's ""kind of having that perfect combination of a time where they are just living life like it's going out of style, followed by a time where they can reflect,"" she said. The American Widow Project is open to widows of any service member as well as women who were engaged to a service member. While the group accepts women of any age, Davis said, the average age of its members is 25. ""Our comfort zone after our husbands were killed was our grief, our pain, this feeling that nobody understood who we were,"" Davis said. ""And when they come to these events, they step outside of that comfort zone, and they're laughing and they're smiling. ... It's one step, but it's the one step that leads to the next step. ... As long as they're taking steps forward, that's all that matters."" When a widow first makes contact with the American Widow Project, Davis sends her an introductory packet that includes her documentary film. The website provides a 24/7 hot line that allows immediate connection to another widow, information on support and services, and personal stories from women who have lost their husbands. It constantly reminds the women that they are in familiar, accepting company. ""One widow told me ... the first time you meet another military widow, it's like someone holding a mirror up to you,"" Davis said. ""And it's a mirror that ... you haven't wanted to look into, because for once, you're finally seeing who you are, and you're seeing it through them. It's liberating."" Six months after her husband was killed in Afghanistan, Brooke Toner attended her first American Widow Project event. ""My little sister wrote Taryn,"" said Toner, 30, through tears. ""She didn't know how to get me through the loss, so she wanted me to find other sisters to get me through the loss. ""From my first event, I went from feeling completely alone to not anymore at all."" According to Davis, that sentiment is returned to her in spades. ""They've given me the gift of life again,"" she said. ""I don't know what my life would be if I didn't talk to a widow every day. I'm so grateful that they're in my life. They've taught me that love is eternal and that life can be amazing again."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- A man apparently angry over a poor performance evaluation entered an Ohio State University maintenance building early Tuesday and opened fire, killing a manager before turning the gun on himself, police said. Larry Wallington, 48, a building services manager at the OSU Maintenance Building, was pronounced dead at the scene of the 3:30 a.m. ET shooting, Ohio State University Police Chief Paul Denton said. Wallington was a 10-year university employee, he said. Authorities found suspect Nathaniel Brown, 51, a custodial worker, suffering from a self-inflicted gunshot at the scene, Denton said. He was transported to the Ohio State University Medical Center, where he was dead on arrival. Police believe Brown -- a probational employee since October who had received a poor performance review -- entered the building dressed in dark clothing carrying two handguns and began firing into an office suite, Denton said. Officials would not say when Brown received the review, who gave it to him or provide further details, citing the ongoing investigation. A third person, Henry Butler, 60, an operations shift leader, also was shot. He was in stable condition at the OSU Medical Center, Denton said. Police earlier Tuesday had said that two people were wounded and one killed and that the alleged shooter was in custody. About a half-dozen employees were at the building when the shooting occurred, and some witnessed it, authorities said. Ohio State's Web site said the building where the shooting occurred was secured, and some traffic restrictions remained in place Tuesday morning. ""The university continues normal operations,"" the school said. ""Classes will be held and normal work schedules are in effect."" E-mail alerts were sent to students warning them about the shooting, the university said. The shooting comes after the university issued e-mail alerts last week about two alleged sexual assaults and an attempted assault on campus, Ohio State's student newspaper reported. The student newspaper, The Lantern, published an article Sunday saying that students were questioning the effectiveness of such e-mail alerts after three serious crimes last week. Students are allowed to choose if they want to receive the e-mail alerts. On the campus of 50,000-plus students, a little more than 2,600 people receive the e-mails, police told the student paper. A university committee was scheduled to meet this week to determine if changes needed to be made to the notification system, The Lantern reported. CNN's Leslie Tripp contributed to this report.","NEW: Authorities find suspect Nathaniel Brown, 51, suffering from self-inflicted gunshot .

"(CNN) -- A Marine Corps reservist helping in a ""Toys for Tots"" drive was stabbed Friday when he grappled with a fleeing shoplifting suspect, authorities in Augusta, Georgia, said. Cpl. Phillip Duggan, 24, suffered a single stab wound. He was treated and released from the hospital later Friday, Sgt. Dan Carrier of the Richmond County Sheriff's Office said. ""He's doing fine."" The suspect attempted to conceal property and was confronted by Best Buy employees, authorities said. An employee struggled with the suspect, who brandished a knife. The employees backed away from the armed man to prevent any injury to themselves or customers, Carrier told CNN. Duggan and several other Marines wearing their dress blues were conducting the annual toy drive in the breezeway of the Best Buy when they heard the commotion and saw the suspect flee through the store entrance, Carrier said. Duggan tackled the suspect and other Marines also moved to stop the suspect, who stabbed Duggan once in the middle of his back, close to his spine, Carrier said. ""They jumped on top of him, and they pulled him down,"" said ""Toys for Tots"" volunteer Larry Frelin. ""It took about five different people on top of him, but unfortunately he had a knife. He brought the knife around and managed to get it in the back of the Marine,"" Frelin told CNN affiliate WRDW. Tracey Attaway, 39, was in custody Friday night and was charged with armed robbery, aggravated assault and possession of a knife during the commission of a crime, authorities said. CNN was unable to reach Duggan or the Attaway residence late Friday. ""Most people who shoplift don't take it to this extreme,"" Carrier said.

"(CNN) -- Police in Poland have recovered the infamous sign stolen from the front gate of the Auschwitz concentration camp and arrested five men, they announced Monday. The ""Arbeit Macht Frei"" sign, which means ""Work Sets You Free"" in German and is synonymous with the Nazi camps of World War II, was stolen late last week from Auschwitz in Poland, police said Friday. The theft prompted outrage around the world. Five men in their 20s and 30s have been arrested, journalist Tomas Machala of CNN affiliate Polsat in the Polish capital Warsaw said Monday. They were not neo-Nazis, he said, in response to speculation at the time of the theft that the far right was responsible. ""They have some criminal background,"" he said, noting they had been arrested for robbery and brawling in the past. He did not give their names. ""They wanted to sell the sign and earn some money,"" he said. Police said it was too early to say if they acted on their own or were hired to commit the robbery. They face up to 10 years in prison if they are convicted, Machala said. It is not clear how they managed to steal the sign, which was cut into three pieces into order to fit it into a car, he said. They were arrested hundreds of miles north of the concentration camp memorial, near the city of Gdansk. The sign had been hidden in a forest, Machala said. Police were ""alerted at 5 a.m. local time on Friday by museum guards"" that the sign, was stolen, according to police spokeswoman Agnieszka Szczygiel. The heavy iron sign ""was removed by being unscrewed on one side and pulled off on the other,"" Szczygiel said. The police investigation is ongoing. The chairman of Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust museum, called the theft shocking. ""The theft of such a symbolic object is an attack on the memory of the Holocaust, and an escalation from those elements that would like to return us to darker days,"" Avner Shalev said Friday. ""I call on all enlightened forces in the world -- who fight against anti-semitism, racism, xenophobia and the hatred of the other -- to join together to combat these trends,"" he said. More than 1 million people died in gas chambers or were starved to death in the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp complex; about 90 percent of the victims were Jews. Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder and dean of the Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal Center, called the sign ""the defining symbol of the Holocaust. ""Everyone knew that this was not a place where work makes you free, but it was the place where millions of men, women, and children were brought for one purpose only -- to be murdered,"" Hier said. ""The audacity and boldness of this crime deserves the full attention of the Polish government."" The center calls itself one of the largest international Jewish human rights organizations. CNN's Laura Perez Maestro contributed to this report.","Police arrest five men after recovering a sign stolen from Auschwitz .

"(CNN) -- A Texas state board said Friday that arson investigators used flawed science but were not negligent in an investigation that led to a controversial 2004 execution. The panel also said that investigators did not commit misconduct. Cameron Todd Willingham was executed in 2004, 13 years after a fire killed his three daughters. Prosecutors argued that Willingham deliberately set the 1991 blaze -- but three reviews of the evidence by outside experts have found the fire should not have been ruled arson. The last of those reports was ordered by the Texas Forensic Science Commission, which has been looking into Willingham's execution since 2008. A September 2009 shake-up by Texas Gov. Rick Perry kept that panel from reviewing the report. But on Friday, the panel declared that investigators were using the science available to them at the time, even though it was flawed. The board said it would present its final report for a vote at a meeting in October. The Forensic Science Commission's chairman is now John Bradley, an Austin-area district attorney with a reputation as a staunch supporter of the death penalty. Bradley has pledged to state lawmakers that the Willingham investigation ""absolutely"" will continue -- but said the panel needs better rules to guide its work, and could not say when the Willingham issue would move forward. Thursday, he told CNN that the concerns of Willingham's supporters are based on ""a lot of misinformation."" ""I think that's being used very much as a side issue to politicize, through some New York lawyers, the work of the commission,"" Bradley said. ""The commission has been very clear that the commission is going to address the merits of the Willingham case."" The panel also said Friday that a legal opinion that challenged the panel's jurisdiction in the matter was not the ""law"" of the commission, state Sen. Rodney Ellis said. On Friday, he said he was ""happy"" to hear the investigation would continue, but concerned that the investigation was looking for misconduct and negligence in the wrong place. ""Unfortunately, the commission is off-track in terms of what it should be investigating,"" he said in a statement. ""It was painfully apparent that many FSC members believe that flawed science was used in the Willingham conviction, but the FSC does not seem interested in looking at the bigger picture: When did the State Fire Marshal start using modern arson science and did the State Fire Marshal commit professional negligence or misconduct when it failed to inform the courts, prosecutors, the Board of Pardons and Parole, and the Governor that flawed arson science had been used to convict hundreds of defendants?"" Ellis, a Houston Democrat, serves as the chairman of the board of The Innocence Project -- the ""New York lawyers"" that have supported efforts by Willingham's stepmother and cousins to clear his name. The group advocates for prisoners it says are wrongly convicted, and Ellis said the commission's work ""is too important to be bogged down in political bickering."" ""Texans need the FSC to perform its work in a timely manner, so the public can once again have confidence in forensic evidence and confidence that the truly guilty are behind bars and the innocent are free,"" he said. But Bradley said the commission has never decided to apply the logic of the legal opinion to the case on Friday's agenda. Bradley was named the panel's chairman two days before the Forensic Science Commission was to hear from Craig Beyler, a Maryland-based fire science expert. Beyler concluded the arson finding at the heart of the Willingham case ""could not be sustained,"" either by current standards or those in place at the time. The Innocence Project requested the investigation after a report it commissioned reached the same conclusion. Death-penalty opponents say an impartial review of Willingham's case could lead to the unprecedented admission that the state executed an innocent man. Perry, who signed off on Willingham's execution, is up for re-election in November, and his critics have accused him of trying to short-circuit the review. Perry has said he remains confident of the condemned man's guilt, and police in the town of Corsicana, where the fire occurred, say other evidence beyond the arson testimony Beyler criticized supports the prosecution. Cox, a retired nurse in Ardmore, Oklahoma, told CNN that spiking the commission's investigation would be a ""blatant miscarriage of justice."" ""The reasonable people of this country and the state of Texas can see through what this is,"" she said.","NEW: Texas panel says investigators were not negligent and did not commit misconduct .

"(CNN) -- General Eric Shinseki, one of the finest soldiers of his generation, performed a final act of service for his country when he fell on his sword. It was a sad moment but, as a life-long patriot, he knew he had to resign as secretary of Veterans Affairs. As good an officer as he was, he could no longer expect to lead his huge department, a bureaucracy second in size only to Defense and representing nearly 15% of the entire federal civilian work force. Evidence has been piling up that he and his top lieutenants knew shockingly little about misdeeds within the department, despite years of negative reports. And he was rapidly losing the confidence of Congress, the public and most importantly, veterans. Now, attention can rightly expand from investigations of the past -- though they must go on -- to how to fix the future. A White House that has hardly covered itself with glory needs to get on top of the problem and stay aggressively there. The place to start is to appoint a world-class leader to run the place and recruit a squad of young, talented veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan as a personal support team. Unfortunately, the best person in the country to run the VA is the least available: Robert Gates. No one knows more or as has been more effective in running large, massive public institutions than Gates. He was not only superb at running the CIA but was then successful in running Texas A&M (the seventh-largest university in the country) and went on to serve with great distinction as secretary of defense, winding down two wars for Presidents Bush and Obama. Borger: Obama defeated by bureaucracy? But Gates is now happy in retirement in Washington state, thousands of miles away from Washington, D.C. If you have seen him on a book tour, you may have noticed the neck brace he had to wear for a few months. He jokes that one morning over breakfast he told his wife he was thinking of returning to D.C. and the next thing he knew, he woke up in the hospital with a broken neck. The point is that the VA desperately needs a leader who can overhaul an agency notoriously resistant to change, someone who knows a lot about military culture. After Gates, the next best choice is likely to be his last deputy at DOD, Ashton Carter. (Disclosure: Carter is a friend and esteemed colleague from the Kennedy School.) Carter won very high marks among civilians and military as deputy secretary, the person who ""runs the building."" The White House may also find a retired four-star general who would be a good fit; retired Gen. John Allen, whom the President tapped to help out with negotiations in the Middle East, quickly comes to mind. But the roster of people who would be strong choices is actually quite limited, so the search must be relentlessly tough-minded. Even so, this is not a one-person job. A new secretary will need reinforcements. There are none better than some of the veterans who have come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, peeled off their uniforms, and volunteered to continue their service as civilians -- rightful heirs of the World War II generation. A smart White House would recruit some of the best among them and put them to work fixing the VA in some imaginative way -- possibly in full-time stints, possibly in consulting teams. An obvious candidate as leader: Lt. Cmdr. Eric Greitens, a Rhodes Scholar, Navy SEAL, veteran of several tours, best-selling author, founder of the veterans group, The Mission Continues (I serve on its board). In recent years, I have had the privilege of teaching a number of veterans who have pursued graduate degrees at Harvard. They are extraordinarily talented and ready to help. Start with Maura Sullivan, for example: Northwestern undergrad, Marine officer in Iraq, graduate of the Harvard Business School and Kennedy School, now rising in leadership ranks at PepsiCo and serving on a federal veterans advisory board. Top talent is ready and willing. Why not ask them for help? Iraq and Afghanistan veterans have had too little voice in the VA. It's time to call on the best to serve their country again.","David Gergen: An admirable Shinseki performed selfless act of service be resigning VA post .

"(CNN) -- A Catholic aid organization operating in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the country's government have accused Uganda-based rebels of massacring 400 civilians during Christmas celebrations last week. The Lord's Resistance Army, led by Joseph Kony, has been accused of many atrocities. The United Nations peacekeeping force in Congo put the death toll at 189 and said the Lord's Resistance Army rebels also abducted 20 children. Caritas International expressed its ""shock"" at the killing spree in northeastern Congo, blaming the rebels for attacking a Christmas day concert sponsored by the Catholic church in the town of Faradje. LRA rebels also burned down a church in another village, it said. ""The areas have been plundered, leaving the people in desperate need of aid,"" the organization said in a news release issued on Monday. ""Caritas says that the number of dead bodies risk spreading disease."" Several Congolese officials and two Catholic priests were among those killed in Faradje, according to the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Congo, known by its French acronym MONUC. The rebels torched 120 homes in Faradje, and looted the rest of the village -- forcing its 30,000 residents to flee to neighboring towns -- according to the U.N., citing humanitarian workers in the region. Congo's Communications Minister Lambert Mende Omalanga told CNN that the attacks happened as the rebels were fleeing Congolese army forces and victims were ""mostly women, children and old men -- those who could not run and escape."" Congo's army, along with Ugandan and Sudanese forces, launched a raid against LRA rebels earlier this month. It came amid stalled peace negotiations intended to disarm LRA leader Joseph Kony and end a rebellion that began in Uganda over two decades ago when President Yoweri Museveni came to power. The LRA, led by Kony, who claims to have spiritual powers, sought to overthrow Uganda's government, demanding the constitution be replaced with a version of the Ten Commandments. The Ugandan government and the rebels agreed to a cessation of hostilities in August 2006, but there have been outbursts of fighting since. The LRA, which the U.S. State Department describes as ""vicious and cult-like,"" is known for its unpredictable behavior. Local villagers and international human rights groups have accused the rebels of committing widespread abuses, including recruiting young boys and girls as soldiers and sex slaves. In October 2005, the International Criminal Court unsealed arrest warrants for five LRA commanders, including Kony, who is alleged to have ""ordered LRA forces to begin a campaign of attacks against civilians in Uganda"" in 2002, according to the court.

"DIXVILLE NOTCH, New Hampshire (CNN)  -- Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama emerged victorious in the first election returns of the 2008 presidential race, winning 15 of 21 votes cast in Dixville Notch, New Hampshire. People in the isolated village in New Hampshire's northeast corner voted just after midnight Tuesday. It was the first time since 1968 that the village leaned Democratic in an election. Obama's rival, Republican John McCain, won 6 votes. A full 100 percent of registered voters in the village cast ballots. And the votes didn't take long to tally. The town, home to around 75 residents, has opened its polls shortly after midnight each election day since 1960, drawing national media attention for being the first place in the country to make its presidential preferences known. However, since 1996, another small New Hampshire town -- Hart's Location -- reinstated its practice from the 1940s and also began opening its polls at midnight. The result in Dixville Notch is hardly a reliable bellwether for the eventual winner of the White House or even the result statewide. Though New Hampshire  is a perennial swing state, Dixville Notch -- until now -- had consistently leaned Republican. The last Democrat it picked was Hubert Humphrey over Richard Nixon in 1968. President Bush won the town in a landslide in the last two elections: He captured 73 percent of the vote in 2004 (19 residents picked Bush while six preferred Sen. John Kerry), and secured 80 percent of the vote in 2000 (21 votes for Bush, five votes for Al Gore.) But villagers expected the results to be close this year given Democrats now outnumber Republicans there. The town picked both John McCain and Barack Obama for the New Hampshire Democratic and Republican primaries in January. McCain ultimately won the state of New Hampshire, while Sen. Hillary Clinton upset Obama there.","NEW: The results -- 15 votes for Obama, six for McCain .

"San Clemente, California (CNN) -- Dana Cummings survived two tours of combat duty as a Marine in the first Gulf War without injury. But 10 years later, he lost a leg in a car crash. A divorced father of three, Cummings said he was abandoned by his girlfriend and denied physical rehabilitation by his insurance. Realizing he needed to be strong for himself and his children, he began an intense workout regimen in the hospital -- then found his own brand of rehab in an unlikely place: a surfboard. ""I wanted to prove that I was whole, and one of the ways to do that was to learn to surf,"" Cummings said. ""When you become disabled, you feel trapped. And when I felt the first breath of freedom, of riding that wave, I was like, 'This is so good, so inspiring.' I wanted to share that feeling that I had with others."" In 2003, he helped create the Association of Amputee Surfers, or AmpSurf. The nonprofit, volunteer-run organization is dedicated to teaching people with disabilities, most of them veterans, how to surf -- for free. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2010 CNN Heroes . ""We want to inspire them to move on and just be active and live full lives,"" said Cummings, 40. ""We want them to walk away with that empowerment, that self-confidence that they can do whatever they set their mind to."" Cummings co-founded AmpSurf with his prosthetist and two other amputees, including Rodney Roller, the man who taught Cummings how to surf. Since 2008, Cummings has been running the organization. AmpSurf is open to anyone with any disability, including spinal cord injuries, blindness, post-traumatic stress disorder and autism. Seventy percent of participants are veterans. The group holds one clinic per month at a beach on the California coast. Participants are provided with food, surfboards, wetsuits, sunscreen and towels. They're paired with one or more volunteers or instructors based on their ability to surf, as well as by disability. Before they get into the water, they receive ""dry land"" instruction on how to get up on the board. But the clinics aren't just about surfing, Cummings said. ""We bring people together to feed off each other and swap stories about what they're going through,"" he said. ""For me, this was the biggest mental rehab I could have ever had."" Anthony Davis is one vet who's benefited from the program. A retired Navy rescue swimmer, Davis, 28, was paralyzed from the waist down as a result of a car accident. ""I remember waking up in the VA hospital in Seattle and not being able to move my legs,"" he said. Doctors told Davis he had a 99 percent chance of never walking again and a 60 percent chance he'd never get out of his wheelchair. But Davis ignored the statistics and was soon standing -- with Cummings' assistance -- on a surfboard. ""Surfing makes me feel like I'm flying,"" Davis said. ""I feel like I don't need my legs. It changed my life by making me feel a lot stronger and more confident."" A year later, Davis taught himself how to walk again and attends as many AmpSurf clinics as possible. He also continues to inspire those around him, including Cummings. ""I'm missing my leg and there are days I don't want to get out of bed,"" Cummings said. ""But I can't imagine being told you'll never walk again, and then having the strength and internal drive to actually do it. Anthony's amazing."" More than 300 people have taken part in AmpSurf clinics, including Brian Ruhe, 35, who lost both legs above the knee when he was 18. ""A lot of us have amputations or some sort of paraplegia, quadriplegia, are stuck in wheelchairs or stuck to their device, and just to be part of nature, to be free to move with the water, it's a freeing experience,"" Ruhe said. Each year, AmpSurf sponsors a group of disabled veterans and non-vets in Operation Restoration, a weeklong clinic that offers surfing and other sporting events. Funding for all of AmpSurf's activities comes from individual donations and local businesses. For Cummings, AmpSurf will always be about more than just surfing; it's about happiness, not just for the participants, but for him and his volunteers. ""I always tell the volunteers, 'You're going to get 10 times more out of this than the person you help today, because everybody feeds off each other. You can't help but be happy,'"" he said. ""None of us get paid, but we come back month after month, year after year, because it feels good to give back and to help somebody."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- Former mortgage broker Alberto Gonzalez is doing well in this economy -- so well that just six months after opening his first restaurant in Chicago, Illinois, he is doing the unthinkable: expanding. Alberto Gonzales is expanding after opening a cafe just six months ago. His second restaurant is scheduled to open in May.  ""I'm nervous, very nervous. But then again it's all about risk,"" said Gonzales, owner of 90 Miles Cuban Café. ""It kind of fell in my lap. The location became available. A friend of mine brought it up and due to the success we had we thought it would be a good time to take advantage of everything that is going on,"" said Gonzales. But with a slew of small businesses closing each day, Alberto said luck isn't a factor in his success. ""I feel fortunate that I had a vision. I didn't hold back from doing it, I risked it all. It's kind of like going to Vegas and putting everything on red and I kind of did that based on my research and so far it's shown that my research has paid off."" Some of his friends think he's crazy for risking it all in a downturn economy. ""Very crazy. It's okay though, I felt the pressure. It just gives me that much more eagerness to succeed,"" said Gonzales. He was was 11 when he left Cuba with his family. He helped his dad sell fish in Key West, Florida, to make a living. Almost 30 years later, after struggling in the mortgage business, Gonzales opened his own restaurant, using old family recipes. But in this economy, 90 Miles Cuban Café's success isn't just helping Gonzales. It's helping his suppliers too. By opening up a second location, he creates a positive ripple effect by spending more with his suppliers, such as Daily Meats.   ""It gives more volume for us on the pork products he buys and the beef products he buys. Volume goes up which is good. It's always good,"" said Mario Jaile, Jr. of Daily Meat Supply. See photos of how Gonzales' cafe has generated a positive ripple effect » . And the ripple effect doesn't stop there. The Turano Baking Company supplies bread to 90 Miles.   ""Obviously our sales rep on the street was extremely excited because that is another new account but it was outstanding to hear. Nowadays especially, businesses have really cut back on the openings; they are holding a little tighter to the vest and here is someone who has only been in the business six months and they are opening a second location. How awesome is that?"" said Turano's Bill Carlson.   Ernesto Reyes of Ez Tech Design, who does advertising for Gonzales, is also benefiting from Alberto's success.   ""Good news for me. I know some people are struggling. It's good news for me in this economy,"" said Reyes. But it's even more good news for Alberto and his second Chicago location. ""I like to believe that we are an inspiration to all of those that it's possible to happen in a downturn economy.""","Former mortgage broker opened a Cuban cafe in Chicago six months ago .

"(CNN) -- The District of Columbia's City Council tentatively approved legislation Tuesday that would decriminalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana in the nation's capital. It's about time. Currently, someone caught possessing marijuana in D.C. faces a year in jail and a $1,000 fine. That would change if the measure becomes law, making it OK to possess small amounts of pot in the District and reducing the punishment for use in public. Approved 11-1 this week, the bill will get another vote and then would need the signature of Democratic Mayor Vincent Gray. But activists here think the Council is moving too slowly. They've filed language for a ballot initiative legalizing possession of 2 ounces of marijuana for adults. If the Council doesn't expand the scope of the reform in the current legislation to their satisfaction, activists will put the question to the voters in November. It's a near certainty the legalization measure will pass if it reaches the ballot. So why should the rest of the country care what happens with D.C.'s marijuana laws? The last time the District adopted a law that ran contrary to the federal government's absolute marijuana prohibition (a medical marijuana law in 1998), Republican leaders in Congress responded by blocking it. They heartlessly denied seriously ill people with cancer and AIDS the opportunity to use or access medical marijuana for over a decade. In 2009, I worked with the original author of the law banning implementation, former Republican Georgia Rep. Bob Barr, and together we lobbied his former colleagues to undo the damage he had done. That fall, Congress removed the ban on the District's medical marijuana law, and the city government slowly made conforming regulations and brought the program online. Socially conservative Republicans, often enabled by Democrats too afraid to speak their real opinions about marijuana laws, generally serve as a good indicator of the expected national response to evolving drug policies. Times sure have changed. Instead of moving to block final implementation of D.C.'s medical marijuana law last year, opponents in Congress were silent. The first legal sale of marijuana to an HIV-positive man in June occurred without warnings that the sky would fall as a result. Six months later in Colorado, the first legal sales to adults started and, again, no claims that the planet will spin off its axis. Up in smoke: The Obama administration's pot politics problem . In fact, if you peeked into a hearing on Capitol Hill on Tuesday called by Republican leadership to address the administration's ""mixed messages"" on marijuana policy, you would have found the most productive debate on marijuana policy that I've seen in more than a decade of working on this issue. Michael Botticelli, the deputy director of the White House's drug control office, even acknowledged under oath that he was not aware of a single overdose death from marijuana -- ever. The senior Republican who called the hearing, Rep. John Mica, was cordial to his Democratic colleagues, one of whom alluded to Grover Norquist's support for allowing states to decide their own policies and call for fair treatment of businesses involved in the legal marijuana trade. Now the attacks are coming from outside the government. Some cynical drug warriors who have now left government service have figured out an effective, albeit untruthful and sensationalist, tactic to fight marijuana reform: comparing the legitimate marijuana business community to Big Tobacco, which notoriously and villainously lied to the American public for decades. They are led by former Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-Rhode Island, who attacked President Barack Obama's recent comments about marijuana, even questioning the president's comments about disparate enforcement of marijuana laws on people of color. That a former congressman, part of an American political dynasty who has enjoyed incredible wealth and privilege his entire life -- who got a ride home from the police in D.C. after crashing his car into a police barricade after taking medication, instead of getting shot or imprisoned -- would lecture the President on the nature of disparate racial enforcement around drug laws is outrageously ironic. Regulating and taxing the sale of marijuana requires that someone grow, process and sell it. Voters in Colorado and Washington clearly said they would rather see upstanding business owners -- not cartels -- running those businesses. Kennedy and his ilk misunderstand the role of entrepreneurs, like the ones I work with, who are active in marijuana dispensaries and ancillary businesses. Big Marijuana? The overwhelming majority of most clients are small businesses or individual consumers. Does that sound like an evil shady Big Tobacco-type corporation that Kennedy warns of? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Aaron Houston.","City Council voted to decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana .
Aaron Houston says it's about time the city took that step .

"(CNN) -- It's hard to think of a better place for a mosque today than lower Manhattan, near to ground zero. To support the siting of a mosque there is not just deeply American--a declaration of the freedoms we stand for -- it is the continuation of a long and established New York tradition of mosque-building. In fact, by any historical measure it is absurd to see Cordoba House, a community center that will include a mosque, as a kind of hostile and exotic cultural invasion of the lower east side. Mosques have been part of New York's rich architectural and religious mix for over a century, and today hundreds of thousands of Muslims, many whose New York roots go back generations -- attend the city's more than 100 mosques in the five boroughs. The Muslims who built these mosques are New Yorkers, blameless in the events of September 11, 2001, and linked to other New Yorkers through the deep shared sense of loss and pain evoked that day. Their mosques, already part of our urban identity, bear witness to the strength of our freedoms, as will the Cordoba House center. It is likely that Muslims have prayed in New York City for much of its history, and particular buildings have been dedicated to Muslim prayer for over a century. Muslim slaves from Africa who lived in New York no doubt had places to pray as early as the 18th century, but the first mosque building in New York was likely the one belonging to the American Mohammedan Society in 1907 on Powers Street in Brooklyn. The Islamic Mission of America constructed its own mosque in 1939, and in 1947 purchased the brownstone where the Masjid Daoud can still be found today. The number of mosques in the city began to increase significantly in the 1960s after the ratification of the 1965 Immigration Act, which increased immigration from non-European countries with Muslim populations. Over time, they would range from modest basement prayer halls to elaborate architect-designed buildings. One small mosque in Brooklyn is composed of a dozen neighbors who take turns leading prayer. The first mosque of a new Muslim community in New York, for example, might simply be a suburban house, like the split-level in Richmond Hills, Queens that served as the Masjid Hazrat-i-abu Bakr in the 1990s. With time, the community might gather the funds to construct a more elaborate building, like Masjid Hazrat-i-abu Bakr's grander building today at the same location. Many mosques in New York City are built and financed by the community members themselves; some donate materials or work or money. The Ali Pasha Mosque in Astoria, and the Albanian Cultural center in Staten Island were completed in the 1990's with the help of the contracting and manual labor of their communities. A new mosque can result in the building up of a neighborhood. Fatih Camii was fashioned from an old building in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, and a representative of the New York Police's 66th Precinct commented to me in the 1990's that the mosque had revitalized the neighborhood: ""Since the congregation renovated the building and began to function, the entire neighborhood has profited."" This is surely the case with the Masjid Malcolm Shabazz, a renovation of the former Lenox Casino in Harlem by architect Sabbath Brown in 1965. There the addition of dome marks the presence not only of a mosque, but a school and other community services that make it a beacon in the neighborhood. The mosque's community has been instrumental in constructing low income housing and supporting the economic revitalization of Harlem. Mosques as community centers all around New York provide day care, help with small business start up, rooms for events, classes in English and other languages, gyms and recreational facilities for their neighborhoods. New York's newly designed mosques are real products of American pluralistic culture. The first mosque in New York designed from the ground up was probably Masjid Alfalah in which the community collaborated with a local Korean-American architect William Park, in 1983. Such grand mosques as the Albanian Cultural Center in Staten Island, or the modernist Islamic Cultural Center on Manhattan's East Side (designed by the famed architectural firm Skidmore, Owings and Merrill) are monuments to the transformations wrought by Muslim communities: They are American mosques. Yesterday New York City's landmarks commission voted unanimously to deny historic status to the Park Place site, clearing the way for construction of Cordoba House, also known as Park51. The name Cordoba House, though, is particularly fitting -- an evocation of the rich interactions of Christians, Muslims and Jews in Medieval Spain. Medieval Spain was not often a paradise of tolerance and peace. But where peoples lived together, the understanding spawned by that coexistence gave the lie to the notion that Muslims, Jews and Christians must by nature be opposed, and created a more cohesive, fecund, peaceful and plural society. The Muslims who pray in New York's mosques are Americans who, like Catholic or Jewish immigrants before them, seek to be part of the city, part of this country. The more than 100 mosques of New York are visual signs, not only of the presence of these Muslim Americans, but also of the religious freedom that distinguishes the American way of life. By their very existence they defeat the hostile, polarized vision of Islam and America that the authors of the WTC attacks hoped to engender. If we wish to stand in defiance of the unspeakable death and destruction of 9/11, we could not do better than to welcome Cordoba House in the very neighborhood of lower Manhattan where those unspeakable acts occurred, as part of the city's long history tradition of mosque-building. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jerrilynn Dodds.","Jerrilynn Dodds says siting a new mosque in lower Manhattan continues long New York tradition .
Muslims have prayed in city for most of its history, she says, likely starting with  slaves .
The number of mosques swelled in 1960s after immigration law passed; there are more than 100 .

"Washington (CNN) -- Colin Powell, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and former secretary of state, has come out in favor of eventually repealing the military's ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy on gay and lesbian service members. ""In the almost seventeen years since the 'don't ask, don't tell' legislation was passed, attitudes and circumstances have changed,"" Powell said in a statement released by his office Wednesday. Powell added that he believes the ultimate decision about the policy should be made by President Obama, the nation's commander in chief; the military's top brass; and Congress. ""I fully support the new approach presented to the Senate Armed Services Committee this week by Secretary of Defense Gates and Admiral Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. I will be closely following future hearings, the views of the Service Chiefs and the implementation work being done by the Department of Defense,"" Powell said. Appearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday, Gates and Mullen said the military is preparing for a repeal of the policy. Mullen told senators it is his ""personal belief"" that ""allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly [in the military] would be the right thing to do."" ""The question before us is not whether the military prepares to make this change, but how we best prepare for it,"" Gates told senators Tuesday. ""We have received our orders from the commander in chief, and we are moving out accordingly."" The ultimate decision about repealing the policy rests with Capitol Hill. Last week, during his first State of the Union address, Obama called on Congress to repeal ""don't ask, don't tell."" The Human Rights Campaign, a civil rights group working to achieve equality for lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender people, hailed Powell's stance. ""General Powell has made clear that his position is about effectiveness in the military,"" Human Rights Campaign President Joe Solomonese said. ""His powerful voice for ending 'don't ask, don't tell' is a tipping point in favor of the brave men and women who are serving our nation in silence. The support of respected present and former military leaders brings us closer to repeal, signaling that we're moving forward and will get there soon."" Solomonese asked opponents of the repeal what they know that Powell, Gates and Mullen don't know. ""The truth is that there are no more excuses, the death knell for 'don't ask, don't tell' has been rung and now is the moment to send this law into the history books where it belongs.""","Powell was George W.

"BRYCEVILLE, Florida (CNN) -- Michael Ratley was known as a hero. Michael Ratley will spend the rest of his life in jail, without parole, for killing his wife with a hammer. In December 2006, Ratley carried his 2-week-old son, Aiden, and his wife, Effie Ratley, 29, from the flames as fire engulfed their Bryceville, Florida, trailer. Days after the fire, a teary-eyed Ratley told local media that love drove him to save their lives. ""I might have lost everything physical, but I've still got my two most precious things,"" Michael Ratley told CNN affiliate WJXT-TV at the time. A month later, Effie Ratley was dead, bludgeoned with a hammer in a bedroom of her in-laws' home, not far from the trailer's ashes on a dirt road marked only with a black arrow on a wooden sign. The man who was hailed as a hero for saving his wife was convicted in July of murdering her. On Tuesday, a Nassau County Court jury in Yulee, Florida, said he should spend the rest of his life in prison for the crime. Circuit Judge Robert Foster sentenced the 25-year-old to life without possibility of parole. What changed a heroic husband into a hammer-wielding wife killer?  Hero gets life for murder » . During the trial, no motive was offered. On January 27, 2007, with his parents downstairs watching TV with the door shut and his infant son in the other room, prosecutors said, Ratley put on a pair of thick black gloves, grabbed a heavy-duty hammer and went into the bedroom where his wife was lying down after taking some medication. He lifted the hammer and ""savagely and brutally beat her on the head over and over"" -- at least seven times, said Assistant State Attorney Bernie de la Rionda. During the trial, Ratley said he had nothing to do with the slaying. His defense lawyers argued that an intruder, who Ratley alleged attacked him in the barn the night before, was the culprit. But prosecutors said that was part of Ratley's plan, setting up for a scenario in which an intruder killed his wife by cutting the wire on their window. Testifying on Tuesday, his friends and family spoke of him as a church-going, gentle man who always went out of his way to help others -- the elderly at a nursing home, a neighbor whose husband was slain and sick family members. ""He has always been a caring, nonviolent person,"" said his mother, Cindy Ratley. ""He'd give you the shirt off his back."" Cindy Ratley said it had been her dream to have her close-knit family living together on her secluded 20 acres. Witnesses for Ratley tried in court to give a picture of the son, grandson, and friend they said he had always been, with the defense calling the murder a ""single, horrible snapshot"" in Ratley's overwhelmingly positive life. They urged the jury to give Ratley's son a chance to know his father, one who cares and loves deeply for him, they said. As his mother and others left the witness stand in the packed and divided courtroom, they each told Ratley they stood behind him and loved him. As they walked back to sit down, many mouthed, ""I love you."" The prosecutors argued Ratley's character couldn't be clearer, based on his actions. ""Unfortunately, the best example we have of his character is in what he did. This shows his best character,"" de la Rionda said, showing the jurors gruesome photos of Effie Ratley's injuries. De la Rionda disputed the description of Ratley as a wonderful father. ""This loving father had no problem whatsoever -- a short distance from his son -- exterminating the life of his son's mother,"" he said. Michael Ratley met Effie Williams when she was having car trouble. He offered to buy a new tire for her and change it. Effie Ratley, who enjoyed listening to '50s music and watching black-and-white movies, was thrilled when she and her husband had their baby, her family told the court Tuesday. ""Her son was her pride and joy,"" said her stepmother, Joy Williams, wearing a purple and pink ""Justice for Effie"" bracelet. ""But she never knew more than six weeks of her motherhood dreams."" By all accounts, the Ratleys' relationship had its rocky points. They were married, separated and remarried. Michael Ratley's family said that the first time the couple got married, they were worried he wasn't mature enough, that he needed to grow up, and they said the couple definitely had growing pains. ""He didn't know if he could love her enough, because he only wanted the best for her,"" Donna Stanley said, talking about her nephew. Effie Ratley's father, Duane Williams, cried on the stand Tuesday as he talked about his only daughter. His voice quivered as he tried to explain how he feels her loss each day. ""She's the first thing I think about in the morning when I wake up,"" he said, his voice wavering. ""And the last thing before I go to bed."" Neither Effie or Michael Ratley's families wanted to speak about the sentencing after the hearing, but de la Rionda said Effie's family was pleased with the result. ""They were always hoping for [the] death [penalty], but they're happy he's going to get life and he's not going to be able to get out,"" de le Rionda said. ""He's going to die in prison."" While the announcement of the sentence, which spared him from death, was greeted with a pronounced ""Yes!"" from Michael Ratley's family inside court, the gravity of the situation seemed to hit during a short recess. His grandmother began sobbing. Family members comforted her until Cindy Ratley sat down next to her. The two cried and embraced for a couple of minutes. Michael Ratley looked over, saw his grandmother upset, and he, too, began to cry.","Michael Ratley, 25, sentenced to life without parole for murdering wife .

"(CNN)  -- For Joey Kemmerling, it was his decision to reveal his sexual orientation that triggered relentless bullying at school. ""I came out of the closet as gay in eighth grade and ever since I've been bullied. I was, for lack of a better word, and still am, the school faggot,"" the 16-year-old Joey recently told CNN's Anderson Cooper. The Pennsylvania native said his decision to come out to classmates not only evoked a firestorm of vicious taunts but also led to a threat on his life. ""There was a point where a kid had a knife on school premises and said, 'I'm going to kill him. I want that faggot dead.' And I had to transfer schools,"" Joey  said. The bullying persisted outside of school, both online and on the street. His mother, Joyce Mundy, said beyond her son being bullied online, she had to file a police report after two boys followed Joey on his walk home, making threatening comments the entire way. Read about CNN's weeklong coverage on bullying . Joey and seven other teens recently spoke to Cooper about the harsh realities of bullying. All eight youngsters said they were not surprised by the recent rash of headlines about suicides of apparent bullying victims. Joey said he believes that most kids who are bullied at some point have contemplated taking their own life. ""If you're bullied for long enough, that's going to go through your mind,"" he said. He added, ""You wake up in the morning and you just think, 'I have to go face them again. I have to spend another eight hours in that prison.' And you just don't want to be there and no matter what you do, you can't escape."" Last week, authorities recovered the body of Rutgers University student Tyler Clementi, who committed suicide after his roommate and another college classmate allegedly placed a camera in his dorm room and streamed his sexual encounter with another male online. Read about Rutgers vigil for Clementi . The statistics on gay youth suicides are unclear since many youths do not admit to others that they are gay or bisexual. But gay and bisexual young adults, who reported higher levels of family rejection during adolescence, were 8.4 times more likely to report having attempted suicide, according to an article from the American Academy of Pediatrics in 2008. Bullying became so pervasive in Joey's life that he admits, in his darkest hours, he too had thoughts of suicide. ""You feel so helpless, and day in and day out you're being called something, and they're telling you the same message: 'Your life is worthless.' And you start to believe it."" ""I believed that I did not deserve to live,"" the gay teen added. Have you ever been bullied? Share your story . Unlike some parents of bullying victims, Joey's mother was fully aware of both the treatment her son was getting and his emotional state. ""He went through a really severe depression,"" Mundy said in a separate interview. ""He talked to me about having suicidal thoughts and was very vocal all the way through. If you really become invested in dealing with your child being bullied, you sort of become peer, friend, counselor. ... Although I was aware how bad things were for him, it's still very scary. ...

"(CNN) -- Muttiah Muralitharan made history with his final ball in Test cricket by becoming the first bowler to reach 800 wickets as Sri Lanka thrashed bitter rivals India. The spinner is the world's leading wicket-taker already but had targeted the landmark total before he hung up his boots after an 18-year career. When India were reduced to 314-9 it looked as if Muralitharan would be forever stranded on 799 wickets, as Sri Lanka went in search of a resounding victory. But with what became his last ever ball in Test cricket Muralitharan had India's last batsman, Pragyan Ojha, caught by Mahela Jayawardene. Muralitharan brings forward his retirement from Test cricket . The 38-year-old was then carried from the pitch in Galle by his teammates, and received a rapturous ovation from the crowd. India's dismissal for 338 meant Sri Lanka needed only 95 runs to win the first Test and Tharanga Paranavitana and Tillakaratne Dilshan knocked them off for no wickets. Muralitharan had been due to quit Tests after the November series against the West Indies, but this month brought forward his decision when the India tour was added to the calendar. He will still be available for the 2011 World Cup which Sri Lanka will co-host with India and Bangladesh, but is expected to retire from all levels of the game after that. India, the top-ranked team in Test cricket, resumed Thursday on 181-5 as they battled to save the Test. Muralitharan dismissed Harbhajan Singh but looked as if he may be left on 799 wickets as VVS Laxman was run out to leave India nine wickets down. But Muralitharan produced a final salvo to snare Ojha, Jayawardene pulling off a diving catch -- the 77th time he has taken a catch off Murali's bowling. The spinner has had a controversial career, with his action the subject of much debate. He was accused of illegally throwing the ball when bowling in 1995, but was cleared by the International Cricket Council after biomechanical tests at the University of Western Australia. Despite further episodes of controversy Muralitharan kept picking up wickets. He now stands 92 wickets ahead of Shane Warne, who is in second place in the all-time list. The Australian leg spinner retired in 2007.","Muttiah Muralitharan becomes the first bowler to reach 800 Test wickets .

"(CNN) -- A French hostage and two pirates died Friday in a rescue operation off Somalia, the French president's office in Paris said Friday. Four hostages, including a child, were freed from the hijacked yacht after almost a week of captivity. Four hostages, including a child, were freed from the hijacked yacht after almost a week of captivity, Nicolas Sarkozy's office said. The four adults and a child had been held aboard their yacht, the Tanit, since it was seized in the Gulf of Aden on Saturday, the president's statement said. The military made its move after the pirates refused their offers, including one to swap an officer for the mother and child held aboard, and threatened to execute the hostages one-by-one -- and because the Tanit was drifting closer to the Somalian coast, the defense ministry said. The possibility that the pirates could take their hostages ashore was a red line that prompted the mission. The same red line triggered two successful rescue missions by the French military last year, the ministry said. According to French media reports, a special forces unit attacked the hijacked vessel from different directions in two motor-powered rubber boats. The pirates opened fire and the special forces team fired back. Two of the five pirates were killed, along with Florent Lemacon, the owner of the Tanit, French media said. The military rescued Lemacon's wife and 3-year-old child along with two friends of the Lemacons. The Lemacons and their friends left Brittany last summer in the Tanit on a round-the-world trip, according to a blog they were keeping about the trip. The blog's last post on March 20 -- when the Tanit was in the Gulf of Aden -- said the French military had twice contacted them in the previous few days to warn them of pirates. The French military brought back 12 pirates to stand trial in the previous two rescue missions, the Defense Ministry said. There has been a series of high-profile and increasingly sophisticated pirate attacks in recent months. View a map of Somali pirate activity » . Also off Somalia this week, the cargo vessel Maersk Alabama was boarded by pirates, who briefly took control of the ship. Although the crew retook the ship, its captain, Richard Phillips, on Friday was still being held by the gang holed up in a lifeboat. The Maersk was hijacked about 350 miles off Somalia's coast, a distance that used to be considered safe for ships navigating in the pirate-infested waters. International navies have increased patrols in the area but the region is so large the pirates can still operate. The U.S. military warned earlier this week that recent attacks have occurred hundreds of miles off the coast, suggesting that pirates are using ""mother ships"" -- a practice of using bigger boats with longer range to launch smaller pirate ships against targets further out to sea. Last year, Somali pirates seized another French luxury yacht and the French military launched an operation that ended with them chasing the gang across the desert.","NEW: Military says mission prompted by fear pirates could take hostages ashore .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Oscar-winning actor Adrien Brody wants a federal judge to stop DVD sales of a horror movie he filmed two years ago because he's still owed $640,000 by the producers. ""Giallo,"" filmed in Italy, never made it to the theaters, but DVD sales begin Tuesday, according to the lawsuit Brody filed last week. A lawyer for Hannibal Pictures, one of the defendants, said the DVD has been in rental stores since September 7, something he said Brody's lawyer should already know. ""He should have gone to Blockbuster and picked it up,"" defense lawyer Martin Barab said. Brody, who won the best actor Academy Award for ""The Pianist"" in 2003, has been paid $960,000 for his work, Barab said. He acknowledged that the British production company still owes the actor the rest of his $1.5 million fee. Brody's lawsuit claims he learned after the first week of filming in Italy that producers Richard Rionda and Rafael Primorac had failed to deposit a portion of his fee into an escrow account as required in his contract. ""In order to induce Brody not to walk off the set, as was his contractual right, Rionda and Primorac represented to Brody that they had new guaranteed funding lined up, and requested Brody to enter into a new superseding agreement,"" the suit said. The new agreement ""expressly granted the absolute right to withhold consent to the use of his likeness in the picture until he was paid the full amount of the $640,000 that he deferred,"" the suit said. The fee has still not been paid and producers have ignored Brody's demands to withhold the movie, the suit said. His lawsuit was filed in a federal court in California ""after repeated and on-going efforts to resolve the matter were rebuffed with excuse after excuse by the producers,"" the suit said. Barab said Brody's lawyer has been ""trying to bully people into paying"" since March. Brody's agreement specified that the payment would come from the sale of the Italian distribution rights, Barab said. When that $2 million deal for that fell through, everyone lost money, he said. ""He's not the only one who didn't get his money,"" Barab said.","Brody claims he's owed $640,000 for filming ""Giallo"" in Italy .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- President Rene Preval said Wednesday that in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake that hit Haiti, he has heard reports of death tolls ranging from 30,000 to 100,000 -- but he said the true toll is not yet known. ""Let's say that it's too early to give a number,"" he told CNN's Sanjay Gupta at the airport in Port-au-Prince. Preval made his comments after touring the damage. ""You have to see it to believe it,"" he said. ""Lots of houses destroyed, hospitals, schools, personal homes -- a lot of people in the street, dead."" Nearly 24 hours after the earthquake, injured people remain on the street. ""We don't have the capacity to bring them to the hospital,"" Preval said. A priority is to clean up the streets, which are clogged with abandoned cars and collapsed buildings, so that rescue workers can do their work, he said. Preval said he himself had not been spared. ""I cannot live in the palace; I cannot live in my own house,"" he said. ""The two collapsed."" He added that he did not know where he was going to sleep Wednesday night, but was not worried. ""I have plenty of time to look for a bed,"" he said late in the afternoon. ""But now I am working on how to rescue the people. Sleeping is not the problem."" He called on the international community to be generous. ""We need doctors, we need medicine, we need medical help in general,"" he said. Preval said he was confident the capital of the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere would not erupt in violence. ""The people understand the situation, and they see that everybody is doing their best to help them,"" he said. Asked what he wanted to tell the world, Preval said, ""I want to thank all the countries that have started to help us,"" and then he went through a list that included the United States, France, Canada, Cuba, Venezuela, Argentina, Dominican Republic and Israel.","President Rene Preval says it is too early to know how many killed by quake .

"Washington (CNN) -- A long and winding road brought Sir Paul McCartney to the White House on Wednesday, where he was honored by the president of the United States and performed some of the most famous songs from his catalogue with the Beatles and after. President Barack Obama awarded McCartney the Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song and then, along with a little help from some of his friends, such as Stevie Wonder, Faith Hill, Elvis Costello, Emmylou Harris and others, McCartney rocked the East Room of the White House. Obama noted McCartney had been involved in writing more than 200 songs that had made the charts of bestsellers, and his songs had stayed on those charts for a cumulative total of over 32 years. McCartney shook his head in wonder at that fact. ""Nearly half a century since four lads from Liverpool first landed on our shores and changed everything overnight,"" Obama said, noting that the bass McCartney played Wednesday was the same one from when the Beatles performed on TV's Ed Sullivan Show in the 1960s. The Gershwin Prize, America's highest award for popular music, was bestowed on behalf of a grateful nation, ""grateful that a young Englishman shared his dream with us,"" Obama said. McCartney thanked Obama for the honor and, in a short political comment, said that he and ""billions"" of others supported what the president was doing in the face of many challenges. Later, McCartney ended the night by saying, in reference to the prize from the Library of Congress, it was good that after the last eight years, America had a president who knew what a library was. The music for the event, which was taped for a PBS special, included unique and riveting versions of well-known songs by a variety of artists. Wonder performed ""We Can Work Out It Out,"" starting over at one point when he couldn't find his harmonica. Costello sang ""Penny Lane"", noting his mother grew up near the location of the song, while Harris sang ""For No One,"" noting it was ""the sad song."" McCartney performed the duet ""Ebony and Ivory"" with Wonder, and then ended the event with some of the most popular songs of his career, including the love ballad ""Michelle"" in honor of the first lady, who attended with both first daughters and the first grandmother. McCartney quipped that, given the song's title, he might be the first guest to get punched out by the president. He followed that with ""Eleanor Rigby,"" ""Let It Be"" and a rousing ""Hey Jude"" that concluded with the first family and all the performers on stage, singing along to the well-known refrain of the title. On Tuesday, McCartney toured the Library of Congress, rehearsed for Wednesday's concert and held a news conference with reporters. They asked the former Beatle about everything from performance royalties and the role of songwriters today to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. McCartney noted that he is not a politician, but said the Gulf of Mexico oil spill is a disgrace. ""I think the fact that something like that can happen and the people who are to blame don't have the ability to instantly cap it and clean it up is something that's going to be addressed,"" he said. Obama mentioned the oil spill in his remarks Wednesday, saying the nation shared in the sorrow of people from the Gulf coast region that also has a rich musical heritage. He noted that people on the Gulf Coast were ""dealing with something we have not seen before,"" and called the situation ""heartbreaking."" The president pledged the nation's commitment ""to see to it that their lives and their community are made whole again.""

"Editor's note: Ben Chavis is the co-author with Carey Blakely of ""Crazy Like A Fox: One Principal's Triumph in the Inner City."" Chavis received his doctorate in education and philosophy from the University of Arizona and served as principal of American Indian Public Charter School for seven years. Chavis has also worked as a real estate investor. Currently, he is replicating the model he established at American Indian Public Charter School in various schools throughout the U.S. and Canada. Educator Ben Chavis says money isn't enough to improve schools run by incompetent administrators. (CNN) -- Teachers unions and politicians are constantly claiming that K-12 public schools need more money in order to produce good academic results. But does the data support the argument that our schools need more money to succeed? The Oakland Unified School District had a budget of $602 million for the 2008-2009 school year, according to Katy Murphy, an education reporter with the Oakland Tribune. That budget, which includes $77 million spent on consultants, means that the district spends an average of $16,270 per student! What have we, the public taxpayers, received for our exceptionally generous financial support of the Oakland public schools? According to the California Department of Education, the district's reported 2008 California Standardized Test scores show: . 1. Of 707 eighth- and ninth-graders who took the California Standard test for general math: 1 percent tested advanced, 5 percent tested proficient and 94 percent failed by testing below grade level.  See details about K-12 schools, teachers » . 2. Of 2,506 ninth- and 10th-grade students who took the California Standards test in algebra: 0 percent tested advanced, 3 percent tested proficient and 97 percent failed the test. How is it possible for a public school system to so liberally spend more than half a billion dollars and still fail to educate 94 percent or more students of all racial backgrounds? Does anyone believe providing more money to these public school systems will enhance these students' academic performance in mathematics? During my principalship at American Indian Public Charter School, we spent less than $8,000 per student, proving that schools did not need more money. We served a student population that is on average 98 percent minority, with 97 percent receiving free or reduced-price lunch and many who are non-English speakers and from single-parent families. AIPCS students spend three to four hours a day working on mathematics and English-language arts. In 2009, they excelled in academics, physical fitness and any standardized test that they were given. The hard work of these students and staff has paid off with virtually all of our eighth-graders testing advanced in algebra, including 100 percent of our eighth-grade black students, Mexican-American students and American Indian students. Before I became its principal, people called American Indian Public Charter School the zoo. The neighbors hated it. They couldn't stand the behavior of the students, who, with little supervision or control, wreaked havoc in the area. Unfortunately, the students who decided to attend the school did not receive the academics and structure they so direly needed. The school was in many ways a failure, a joke, a sham. When I took over as principal in 2000, it was the worst middle school in Oakland. I told the board I would take the job only if they let me go my own way and do what I thought was best. I implemented a golden rule at American Indian Public Charter School for staff, students and families: If you act like a winner, you'll be treated like a winner. If you act like a fool, you'll be treated like a fool. The charter school is now one of the top-scoring schools in the state and is nationally recognized. The United States spends more money on public education than any other country in the world. Yet, we still have a secondary public education system that ranks with Third World countries in preparing our children in English-language arts, mathematics, science and social studies. Washington, D.C.; Detroit, Michigan; Los Angeles, California; Kansas City, Missouri; and numerous other cities throughout the United States are producing the same poor academic results at an extraordinary cost to the taxpayer and a tremendous academic loss to our students and country. I believe all the money in the world would not be enough to improve schools run by incompetent public school administrators. We need proven leaders who can prepare our children to be competitive members in a free-market society. The American public has been conned into believing that public schools need more money. Have you ever met a public school administrator who said they have enough money? President Obama is moving in the ""right"" direction by reforming public schools to be held responsible to the American public in return for more money. It's very clear that most Americans want to ensure that accountability be attached to the stimulus money that is being awarded to all institutions, including public schools. Next time you hear school officials or politicians begging for more money, ask them how large the district's budget is and how many students are enrolled in their district. Then you do the math. After all, it's your money they want to take. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ben Chavis.","Chavis: ""All the money in the world"" isn't enough to help poorly run schools .

"Washington (CNN) -- Memorial crosses erected along Utah public roads to honor fallen state highway troopers have been found unconstitutional by a federal appeals court. A three-judge panel of the 10th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled Wednesday that the 14 large crosses would be viewed by most passing motorists as ""government's endorsement of Christianity."" ""We hold that these memorials have the impermissible effect of conveying to the reasonable observer the message that the state prefers or otherwise endorses a certain religion,"" concluded the Denver, Colorado-based court. The state of Utah and a private trooper association have the option of appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court. A Texas-based group, American Atheists, successfully sued five years ago to have the nonprofit memorial project scrapped, and the crosses removed from public property. At issue was whether the crosses violated the Establishment Clause of the Constitution, by having the government endorsing the Christian symbols, even if indirectly. Although the suit went against the memorial project, the crosses were allowed to remain pending appeals in the case. They are still in place. The Utah Highway Patrol Association in 1998 began erecting the monuments, which contain the fallen trooper's name, rank, and badge number. A picture of the officer and some biographical information is included on a separate plaque placed where the two bars of the cross meet. The state insignia is also included, which the judges in particular raised with constitutional concerns. The service group said their main message was not religious in nature, but among other things, to serve as ""a lasting reminder to UHPA members and Utah highway patrol troopers that a fellow trooper gave his life in service to this state"" and to ""encourage safe conduct on the highways."" While placed on public land and with the state's permission, the crosses themselves are privately owned and maintained. The state expressly noted it ""neither approves or disapproves of the memorial marker."" In rejecting the crosses, the appeals court made several arguments, such as the large size and location of the crosses -- on busy public highways where motorists cannot help but notice. Other similar memorial crosses have been erected on public land such as Arlington National Cemetery to honor fallen war dead. But the judges noted those markers are generally accessible or visible only to those who expressly choose to visit them, unlike roads where citizens cannot help but see them. The Supreme Court has in recent years taken a case-by-case approach to Establishment Clause cases. The justices in 1947 said the government needed to be ""neutral"" but ""not an adversary"" toward religion. The court has upheld legislative chaplaincies, tax exemptions for churches, and the mention of ""God"" on U.S. currency and in oaths of office. At the same time, government-sponsored school prayer is banned, and limits imposed on aid to parochial schools. The court's record on religious displays on public land is more mixed, with ""context"" a key criteria. The justices last year decided on free-speech grounds a small religious group could not erect a granite monument in a Utah park next to an existing Ten Commandments display, which for the time being was allowed to stay. And this past June, the conservative majority of the court concluded a cross designed as war memorial in lonely stretch of national parkland in the California desert did not violate the constitutional separation of church and state. In 2005, a Ten Commandments monument on the Texas statehouse grounds was allowed to stand, since it was surrounded by historical markers. But the same day Ten Commandment parchments in two Kentucky county courthouses were ruled unconstitutional, with the high court majority calling them ""a governmental effort substantially to promote religion, not simply an effort primarily to reflect, historically, the secular impact of a religiously inspired document."" And some nativity scenes and menorahs placed in public parks during December have been allowed to stand, while some were ordered removed. The 10th Circuit rejected arguments from the UHPA that many roads contain crosses or other religious symbols placed by private individuals honoring a dead relative killed in car accidents. ""The mere fact that the cross is a common symbol used in roadside memorials does not mean it is a secular symbol,"" said the panel. ""The massive size of the crosses displayed on Utah's rights-of-way and public property unmistakably conveys a message of endorsement, proselytization, and aggrandizement of religion that is far different from the more humble spirit of small roadside crosses."" The judges also disregarded suggestions that since most of the deceased troopers were Mormon, where the Utah-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints does not uses the cross as a religious symbol, the highway memorials were merely symbols of death and did not promote a a particular faith. There was no immediate reaction to the opinion from American Atheists or the UHPA. The case is American Atheists v. Duncan (08-4061).","In Utah, 14 large crosses on public roads honor fallen state troopers .

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- You're a mean one, Mr. Gingrich. Well, not really. Those of us who know Newt Gingrich tend to describe him as not only intelligent but also charming. Some members of the Washington press corps will admit as much, even though they usually don't agree with Gingrich's views. No matter. Facts shouldn't get in the way of a good smear. And at the moment, the left is trying to dampen the appeal of the former House speaker and current GOP presidential front-runner by likening him to a green and hairy Dr. Seuss character who tries to steal Christmas. Only in the real life version, Gingrich is supposedly at war with the poor for saying this: ""Really poor children in really poor neighborhoods have no habits of working and have nobody around them who works, so they literally have no habit of showing up on Monday."" That narrative was front and center again this week as Gingrich explained his remarks to reporters gathered at a New York press conference, emphasizing that he believes the secret to getting America working again is to teach some Americans how to work. ""I've been talking a little bit about the importance of work,"" Gingrich said, ""particularly as it relates to people who are in areas where there are public housing where there are relatively few people who go to work."" At one point, Gingrich turned the tables on the reporters and asked them a question. He wanted to know, ""How many of you earned some money doing something before you were 10 years old, whether it was cutting grass or babysitting or something?"" Talk to hugely successful people, Gingrich said, and most of them will say that they got an early start learning about jobs and responsibility and earning money for their labor. Tragically, that's not happening with many young people today. Gingrich pointed out that, for instance, among African-American teenagers, the unemployment rate is a staggering 43%. Now, you can spin a statistic like that one of two ways. You can say these unemployed black teenagers are helpless victims and the system is working against them. Or you can say that many of these teenagers are unemployable because no one ever taught them the skills necessary to hold down a job. Gingrich thinks government should have a hand in creating a ""pathway to work"" so ""people get in the work habit and learn the skills to be successful."" Bravo for Newt. Politicians don't usually speak this way, which is why so many of them have mastered the art of talking for hours without saying anything of importance. I can't imagine Mitt Romney saying these things; he's too busy telling people what they want to hear to tell them what they need to hear. This subject is as important as they come, and Gingrich deserves credit for kicking off the discussion, especially since he was sure to be pummeled for stating the obvious. Here's the obvious: Americans have lost their work ethic, and some never had one to lose. They grow up -- or put more precisely, they're raised -- thinking of so many jobs as beneath them that they wake up one day not knowing how to do any job. Gingrich was right on the money. But I would go further than he did. This isn't just a problem for black Americans; it's a problem for all Americans. In fact, as someone who speaks to groups all over the country and who spends a fair amount of time visiting high schools and colleges, I worry less about students from poor families who lack resources and opportunities than I do about those from the upper-middle class who lack passion and purpose. Poor kids often have a fire in their belly, a desire to improve their lot and help their parents. Upper-middle class kids can be harder to motivate, especially if they've never been taught to work by their parents. You think I'm kidding. I remember once seeing a 21-year-old struggle with how to hold a broom and sweep the floor. It wasn't his fault. No one had ever taught him how to do that chore -- or any other. Whenever I write about young people and the jobs they won't do, I hear from dozens of employers with stories of their own. The common theme in all those e-mails is that we've been too soft on our kids and haven't demanded enough from them, something we hardly notice because we've allowed illegal immigrants to pick up the slack. Parents used to make their children work after school, or on weekends, or during summer break, to earn extra money to buy what they wanted. They gave them a list of chores to do to earn their allowances. No chores, no allowances. Today, parents find it easier to skip the chores and buy their kids what they want, which is no good for anyone and no good for society. You know what is good? This conversation, and others like it. No subject this important should be off limits. After all, how do we fix a problem if it is considered taboo to even mention it? Newt Gingrich had the courage to mention the problem of America's vanishing work ethic, and emphasize the need to restore it. And for that, Americans should be thankful. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr.","Newt Gingrich said poor teens don't see people working so don't learn work habits .
We have lost our work ethic, Navarrette says. Not just poor kids: richer kids lack purpose .

"New York (CNN) -- One of four victims injured nearly three decades ago by Bernhard Goetz, a man New Yorkers once dubbed ""the subway vigilante,"" has been found dead, according to a source with knowledge of the investigation. James Ramseur, 45, was found Thursday, exactly 27 years to the day after a controversial subway shooting catapulted him and the others into the national spotlight, highlighting strained race relations and fears of widespread crime in New York City during the 1980s. Ramseur was found unconscious in a Bronx motel room by motel staff members. The cause of his death was not immediately clear. Since that infamous 1984 shooting, Ramseur had a largely troubled life, having been convicted on rape and robbery charges. He was sentenced in 1986 for those crimes, and served 25 years behind bars, according to the state's Department of Corrections and Community Supervision website. ""It's always sad when someone takes their own life,"" said former New York Mayor Ed Koch, who was in office at the time of the shooting. Koch's comment was an apparent reference to media reports that say Ramseur died of a drug overdose. CNN cannot independently confirm that account. Goetz shot Ramseur and three other African-American teenagers on December 22,1984, aboard a Manhattan subway car. The four victims said they were panhandling for money to play video games and had asked Goetz for $5. Goetz, a white man, testified that he felt threatened and thought he was being robbed, and he fired several rounds into the youths. A jury acquitted Goetz of murder and assault charges in the shooting, but convicted him of illegal possession of a weapon. He served just over eight months behind bars. Lawsuits filed against Goetz were initially dismissed. But in 1996, a jury awarded Darrell Cabey -- who was paralyzed in the shooting -- $43 million for his injuries. A judge later ruled that Goetz, who had filed for bankruptcy, was still liable to pay the sum. The shooting garnered national attention and came during a period of high crime in New York, said Mitchell Moss, professor of urban policy and planning at New York University. The city's crime levels peaked in 1990, noted Moss, when more than 2,200 homicides were reported across the five boroughs. As of Thursday, police reported that the city's 2011 numbers tallied less than 500. ""We really had a city out of control"" during the 1980s, Moss told CNN. ""New Yorkers were living in an environment in which they had really become accustomed to a high level of crime, some of this due to the crack cocaine epidemic, the economy and the shrinking of the police department."" Some observers view the Goetz shooting as a low point in relations between blacks and whites in New York.","James Ramseur, 45, is found dead in a New York CIty motel room .

The home of the high court is both tourist attraction and working government building. Symbols abound, but so does a measure of secrecy. Most of the four floors are closed to the public, including the library, dining rooms and gymnasium. ""One of the tasks that was assigned to the architects was to make sure that this building blended in with the Library of Congress next door and also with the Capitol"" building across the street, said Catherine Fitts, the Supreme Court's curator. ""They wanted to have that grand statement, that something important is going on here."" It is the little details of this place, the surprises around every corner, that give the Supreme Court building its power and charm, including: . -- Two spiral staircases winding along the wall up several floors, a unique construction duplicated in only a few other places in the world. These architectural marvels were built without a central support, with the marble steps embedded deeply in the wall, each resting atop the other. -- The ornate friezes above the courtroom showing great figures of law, such as Moses holding the Ten Commandments and one of the few depictions ever of the Prophet Mohammed/ . -- Decorative turtles encircling the base of exterior lamp poles, symbols of the deliberative pace of justice. -- The Robing Room, just off the courtroom, where the justices as a group put on the sober black frocks before public sessions. By tradition, they shake hands as a sign of common purpose and respect. For the first 146 years of the Supreme Court's existence, it competed for space, often as a vagabond tenant. Reflecting the federal judiciary's long struggle over decades to assert its status as an equal, independent branch of government, the search for a permanent home was equally tough. The court first met in 1789 at the Merchant's Exchange Building in New York, then the federal capital. It moved to City Hall in Philadelphia, then to various rooms in Washington's U.S Capitol, where for a time it shared space with an orphans court. When the British set the Capitol complex ablaze during the War of 1812, the displaced court met for a time in a private home. The justices eventually wound up in 1860 in the Old Senate Chamber, their home until 1935. By then it took a chief justice with enough political pull to persuade Congress to give the Supreme Court a building befitting its reputation. Chief Justice William Howard Taft, the former president, was instrumental in securing the funds. ""It was really his vision that made the building reality,"" said Matt Hofstedt, the court's associate curator. ""Unfortunately he passed away [in 1930] before the building was actually built. He never got to see his dream come true."" Taft and chief architect Cass Gilbert did not have to look far for their grand vision. The land across from the Capitol was occupied by row houses, seized from the National Woman's Party under eminent domain. The mandate from Taft and later Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes was to create ""a building of dignity and importance suitable for its use as the permanent home of the Supreme Court of the United States."" ""Marble is most definitely the predominant material that's used,"" Fitts said. ""In fact, of the original $9.7 million spent, about $3.5 million was just on marble alone. So the premise, the design of the building is a Greco-Roman temple, kind of a temple of justice."" Gilbert modeled his courtroom design on the West Virginia Supreme Court chamber, also his creation. It took three years and more than $9 million to finish -- Depression dollars -- completed on time and on budget. Not every member of the high court was thrilled at the arrangements. Justice Louis Brandeis initially refused to move, as did other colleagues used to working at home. Harlan Fiske Stone called the courtroom ""almost bombastically pretentious ... wholly inappropriate for a quiet group of old boys such as the Supreme Court."" One contemporary news report noted Owen Roberts' wooden bench chair cracked on the opening day of the court, and he nearly fell off. The first thing a visitor to the court's restricted areas notices is the quiet. Hushed dignity pervades the marble hallways and wood-lined rooms. History-making events happen here, landmark opinions like Brown vs. Board of Education, Roe v. Wade, and Bush v. Gore were written and debated here. Among the rooms are: . -- The Library. With 600,000 volumes, the oak-paneled library on the third-floor is the court's information center. Only court personnel, members of Congress and bar members are allowed to use it. ""The library is a very vibrant part of what the court does, because you need that sort of scholarly input in the opinion writing process,"" Hofstedt said. With so much legal information available online, the library is not used nearly as much anymore. -- The East and West Conference Room. Just off the Upper Great Hall are two areas used for various ceremonial and administrative functions. Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan were sworn in there. The walls are lined with portraits of the 16 chief justices that have served, not counting the current head of the judiciary, John Roberts. The curators show us a special object -- a chair once used in the chambers of John Marshall, unquestionably the most important chief justice, who served from 1801-35. ""When a justice is joining the court, they sit in the chair in front of the bench,"" said Hofstedt of the public investiture ceremony. ""The incoming justice sits in the chair while the commission is read in open court, and then they stand and take their oath, then take their seat on the bench."" A smaller conference room nearby is exclusive, used by the nine justices to vote on future and pending cases. -- The Dining Rooms. On days when the court is in public session, the justices carry on a tradition by lunching informally together in private. One unofficial rule: they do not discuss cases they just heard. A separate space known as the Marshall Dining Room is also just for the justices. The room contains portraits of James Madison and William Marbury from the famous 1803 Marbury vs. Madison case that established judicial review. -- The Upper Great Hall and Courtroom. Visitors traditionally entered the court by ascending the exterior steps and walking through two huge bronze doors. There, they were welcomed by a sweeping public hallway that leads to the courtroom. Security concerns forced tourists this year to now enter the building only on the ground floor. Justices Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg in May lamented the closing of the old main entrance as hurting the symbolic image of the public ascending the stairs to seek justice at the nation's highest court. The public hall -- buttressed by huge marble columns -- was where the bodies of Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justice Thurgood Marshall lay in repose. In the middle of the building is the courtroom, with its ornate ceiling decorations, brass railings, and angled bench. ""One of the traditions is that the justices come out from behind the red curtain, and they come out in groups of three,"" Hofstedt said. ""And this is right after the [court] marshal has done the 'Oyez, Oyez, Oyez,' chant that's very famous and that's been going on all the way back to the days of John Marshall. And that brings the court to attention, everybody rises, the justices come out -- and that sort of brings that moment together."" The public is invited to watch the oral arguments on scheduled days from October to April. No reservations are needed, but most visitor will likely have to wait in line to get a seat. Quill pens adorn the desks, and the floor plans have changed little over the decades. Little twin white and red lights at the wooden lectern for lawyers signal when their time arguing before the bench has ended. Change does come to the court, if slowly. A seven-year modernization program is almost complete, to replace aging infrastructure, including the garage, as well as climate control and electrical systems. In a town where image often conveys strength and purpose, the high court's building serves both. It is an evolving institution -- at home with tradition, yet aware it must confront powerful forces of social and political change. ""We are a major symbol, the symbol of the courts,"" Breyer told CNN in September. Noting those symbols in the building at 1 First Street, he said, ""each of these elements encourages contemplation of this court's central purpose, and that is the administration of justice to all who seek it."" CNN's Kate Bolduan contributed to this report.","The U.S. Supreme Court building turns 75 this year .

"(CNN) -- Sweden is having a very good year... in America. Anticipation is building for the film version of journalist Stieg Larsson's immensely popular book ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" (due in theaters in December), Stockholm-based streaming service Spotify just launched last month in the United States to acclaim from tech blogs, and branches of Swedish discount store H&M are opening in malls across America with their winning formula of designer duds at bargain basement prices (the first Texas outpost of the chain debuted last week in Dallas). But the way the Nordic nation is most influencing America this year is via several stellar singer/songwriters who are resonating with fans in a way not seen in the United States since acts like Ace of Base and Roxette ruled the airwaves and MTV. Today, the names to know are Robyn, Lykke Li and Swedish House Mafia, all of whom have suddenly moved beyond cult status and crept into the mainstream, selling out shows and popping up on some of the largest radio stations in America. The United States' embrace of Sweden this year has pleased one artist, Robyn, who has taken the proverbial long road to success over the past 15 years or so. ""I have been touring this record since May 2010 to continue what I started with the last album,"" she said after an appearance on ""The Tonight Show with Jay Leno"" earlier this month. ""I wanted to build my audience in the U.S. in an organic way. It seems to work, although it's very hard for me to say why. ... I hope it's because the music is good."" For the humble performer, who is known for her quirky outfits and earnest delivery devoid of pop star artifice, being Swedish is paramount to her personality, and by extension, her music. ""Because of where we are geographically, we probably see ourselves as outsiders,"" she explained when asked why Sweden seems to produce so many interesting artists who are winning fans across multiple genres of music at the moment. ""We consume and are fascinated by Anglo-American culture, and I think that has made it possible for us to make music that makes sense in the big world as well,"" she added. Proof of Robyn's assertion could be found at Gothenburg's Way Out West festival earlier this month, where progressive bookers reportedly laid out more than $2 million to land names such as Prince and Kanye West to play alongside homegrown talents such as Säkert and Robyn as a cross-pollination experiment -- providing a heady mélange of influences that thrilled and will likely inspire young Swedes who are already avid fans of rappers such as West as well as more traditional songwriters. Just as Swedes are interested in uniquely American artists like Prince, so too are Americans becoming curious about quintessentially Swedish names such as Robyn. The singer topped many critics' Top 10 lists last year with her ""Body Talk"" series, which is still selling slowly, though steadily, this year as the passionate 32-year-old keeps converting new fans via video releases on YouTube and buzzed-about live shows. But it's not just Robyn cutting deep into the hearts of U.S. music fans. Lykke Li has seen surprising success abroad with a different sound that is proving no less appealing to many. The singer recently sold out shows at Los Angeles' Greek Theater and New York's Summerstage and has received airplay on influential rock station KROQ and elsewhere. Her new record, ""Wounded Rhymes,"" has so far sold around 62,000 copies, per Nielsen SoundScan, and is tipped as one to top many critical Top 10 lists this year. In the indie rock world, where acts from Stockholm's ripe experimental pop scene have long been championed, names such as Peter, Bjorn & John, Little Radio and The Teddybears continue to excite adventurous music consumers. However, it's dance music where Sweden has truly left its mark recently, and 2011 is proving a banner year for Swedish DJs such as Avicii, Swedish House Mafia and Dada Life -- all of whom are connecting with young fans of house music who flock to festivals such as Las Vegas' massive Electric Daisy Carnival. The DJs spotlight sweeping, optimistic anthems that pulse with confidence and aspire outward with an escapist sound big enough to fill any void in a globally depressed economy. ""It's so cold in Sweden and there's nothing much to do ... a lot of us dream of getting out,"" said Avicii, aka Tim Bergling, after a set in Europe where the 21-year-old played to a crowd of around 25,000 people.  ""We see the success of people like Swedish House Mafia and it's an inspiration."" It's that success of Swedes abroad that seems to be the key to why Sweden outperforms its Scandinavian neighbors in the music industry. Despite a wealth of talent from countries such as Denmark, Finland and Norway, it's only Sweden that has numerous blogs such as New York's The Swede Beat and Chicago's Swedesplease obsessively tracking new music from the Nordic nation. Swedish influences are being felt in America in major U.S cities such as Los Angeles, which boasts bands aping the ""Swedish sound."" Southern California, in fact, has long been connected to Stockholm in music circles, and the cities are only getting closer. Swedish producers living and working in L.A., such as Max Martin (who has penned hits for artists such as Britney Spears and plans a permanent move to L.A. this fall with his family) and Red One (Lady Gaga), have helped craft a sound that has all but taken over urban and pop radio formats in the United States. When labels or managers need an uplifting hit, Swedes often get the call. So what's the secret that's made Sweden a virtual hit factory since the days of ABBA? The reasons are myriad, but Malmö-born, L.A.-based producer/songwriter Tobias Karlsson has a few ideas. ""There's more focus on melody in Sweden,"" said the co-founder of music-licensing company Thunderhoney. ""Sweden has a very strong folk music tradition spanning back 800 years at least which is almost all melody driven,"" continued the producer, who is fresh off work on a Carolina Liar record. Robyn echoed the sentiment. ""Swedish folk music is so melancholic and melodious and I seem to find those qualities in Swedish modern music as well,"" she said. ""A lot of countries don't have that melody tradition, but us Swedes are pretty crafty. ... We like to engineer and make sure everything is perfect,"" Karlsson said. For music lovers in America, that quixotic quest for melodic pop perfection has not gone unnoticed in 2011.","Swedish influences are being felt in America in major U.S cities such as Los Angeles .

"Orlando (CNN) -- Caylee Anthony's grandmother gave jurors in her daughter's capital murder trial a detailed glimpse of her efforts to connect with the 2-year-old girl in the weeks following her disappearance, recounting reason after reason her daughter gave for keeping the toddler away from home for nearly a month. The reasons included work meetings, a car accident and sudden plans to hang out at a hotel with a wealthy suitor Cindy Anthony said she had long heard about, but had never met, jurors in the Orlando woman's capital murder trial heard Saturday. Testimony from Cindy Anthony dominated the abbreviated Saturday session, which ended just before 1 p.m. in Orlando. Casey Anthony, 25, is charged with seven counts, including first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse and misleading police in the death of her daughter, who was last seen June 16, 2008. Her skeletal remains were discovered were found in a wooded field in December 2008. Prosecutors say Anthony used chloroform on her daughter and then put duct tape over her nose and mouth, suffocating the girl. Anthony's attorneys argue that she did not kill Caylee, but rather that the girl accidentally drowned in the Anthonys' pool. They say Anthony and her father discovered her body, panicked, and kept the death a secret. George Anthony denied that claim in testimony Thursday. After describing her last day with Caylee, spent visiting the girl's ailing great-grandfather in a nursing home, swimming at home and then looking at pictures and videos, Cindy Anthony testified about her efforts to talk to Caylee between June 16, the next day, and July 15, when she was finally reported missing to police. ""There was always a reason I missed her,"" Cindy Anthony said. At first, Cindy Anthony said, she believed Caylee was staying with her nanny, Zanny, while her daughter attended work meetings. Then, Anthony told her mother that she was taking the girl to Tampa, Florida, for an outing with a co-worker and her child. When they didn't return as expected, Cindy Anthony testified her daughter told her a serious car accident had left Zanny injured, and that she felt obligated to stay and care for her. When her father, George Anthony, ran into her at home on June 24, when she was supposed to be nearly 80 miles away in Tampa, Casey Anthony explained she had returned to get insurance information for Zanny and get some things from home, Cindy Anthony testified. When asked why she didn't bring her daughter home, Casey Anthony said she ""didn't think about it,"" her mother testified. After that, Casey Anthony told her mother that she, Caylee and Zanny were staying at an Orlando hotel with a wealthy suitor, according to Cindy Anthony's testimony. When she failed to return home as expected, Casey Anthony then explained the delay by saying she was working on a closed Make-A-Wish event that Caylee could attend, but Cindy Anthony could not. On July 3, Cindy Anthony testified, she went to Universal Studios -- where she believed her daughter worked -- to confront her over a money issue. That's when Casey Anthony told her she wasn't in Orlando, but rather in Jacksonville, Florida -- at the suitor's condo. Despite what she was telling her mother, Casey Anthony was actually spending time in Orlando with numerous friends, attending parties, going shopping and hitting nightclubs, according to previous testimony and evidence in the case. For instance, on June 20, when Casey Anthony was telling her mother she was working and taking Caylee to an amusement park in Tampa with a co-worker, she was instead participating in a ""hot body"" contest at an Orlando night club, according to previous testimony in the case. Photos of the event shown at the trial show her dancing at the club. Casey Anthony's attorneys explain her behavior in June and July 2008 by saying she had been sexually abused by her father and was trained from a young age to hide her pain. George Anthony denied abusing his daughter in previous testimony. Cindy Anthony broke down on the stand early in her testimony, while look at pictures of Caylee's Winnie the Pooh-themed bed, depictions of her backyard playhouse and an image of her visiting the nursing home. At one point, she interrupted prosecutor Linda Drane Burdick's qustioning to ask that Caylee's image be taken off a computer screen in front of her. ""I'm trying not to cry,"" she said. During a break following testimony in which Cindy Anthony was discussing how she and her husband, George, bought and installed an outside playhouse for Caylee, Casey Anthony could be seen crying and gesturing angrily as she spoke with her attorneys. Earlier Saturday, Casey Anthony's former boyfriend took the stand to discuss text messages between the two on July 16, the night after Anthony's daughter was reported missing to police by Cindy Anthony. In the messages, Anthony told the boyfriend, Anthony Lazarro, that she had been driving around with police looking for her daughter. ""If they don't find her, guess who gets blamed and spends an eternity in jail?"" Anthony texted. Anthony called herself ""the dumbest person and the worst mother."" ""The best person in my life is missing and God only knows if I'm ever going to see her again,"" read another text. Prosecutors began questioning Lazarro the day after Judge Belvin Perry questioned their attempts to introduce another set of instant messages that Assistant State's Attorney Frank George said showed Anthony believed her daughter was in the way of their relationship. ""... Only a few more days and you can bring your ass over anytime you want and stay any night you want,"" read one text message that prosecutors said was sent June 10. George said the message and others like it would help prove Anthony's motive for killing Caylee. George said the instant messages showed that Caylee's presence was stifling her lifestyle, which prosecutors have tried to paint as hard-partying and carefree. ""She couldn't do what she wanted to do,"" George told Perry in a discussion held without the jury present in the courtroom. But Perry questioned the logic, asking why Anthony did not also plot to kill her parents. After Perry said he did not believe the evidence was relevant and would be excessively prejudicial even if it was, prosecutors withdrew their attempt to have it introduced into evidence, for the time being at least. Testimony Friday focused largely on Casey Anthony's car, a white Pontiac Sunfire found abandoned in a parking lot and later towed to an impound lot where her parents, George and Cindy Anthony, picked it up  two weeks later. George Anthony and a tow company manager testified that Casey Anthony's car reeked of the unmistakable odor of a decomposing body. In all, Anthony is charged with first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse, aggravated manslaughter of a child and four counts of misleading police. If she is convicted of capital murder, she could be sentenced to death by the seven-woman, five-man jury. Anthony has pleaded not guilty and denies harming her daughter or having anything to do with her disappearance. Baez has said that once all the facts are known, it will become clear that his client is not guilty. The trial will resume Tuesday after a break for the Memorial Day holiday. It is expected to last another five to seven weeks. CNN's Ashley Hayes contributed to this report. Watch Nancy Grace Monday through Sunday starting at 8 p.m. ET on HLN.

"Washington (CNN) -- The dangerous roads of Iraq and Afghanistan have forced changes in what soldiers drive, and forced costs up as well, according to a just-released report on Army vehicles. The former military workhorse, the Humvee, carried a $70,000 price tag. As that was modified, or ""up-armored,"" the cost rose to from $160,000 to $220,000. ""This modern Up-Armored HMMWV (UAH), however, still does not fully meet the evolving mobility or protection requirements of our soldiers,"" according to the report, released by the Army Thursday. It looks ahead to future needs for tactical wheeled vehicles. The next generation, JLTV, the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, has new capabilities and a higher price but is still far cheaper than, MRAPs, Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles, developed to counter hidden explosive devices, the report notes. ""The cost to provide this capability is high -- it is estimated that each JLTV will cost in excess of $300,000 before equipping with essential combat systems -- but not as high as the cost of the MRAP family of vehicles, which cost $430,000 - $900,000 apiece to procure,"" the report says. The Army estimates that its wheeled vehicles right now cost $70 billion. ""To meet the threat on today's battlefields, trucks must now be armored, have the additional capacity and power to carry that armor, and be outfitted with a wide variety of command, control, communications and computers, and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance equipment,"" the report says. But the report also recognizes that budgets may be contracting. ""The Army is also on the downward side of a phase of increased funding to support fleet growth and modernization,"" the report says. ""As a result, the Army of the next 15 years must adapt its TWV fleet to meet the threats of today and tomorrow, with reduced funding as compared to the past seven years.""","""Up-Armored"" Humvees cost up to $220,000 each, up from an original $70,000, the report says .

"(CNN) -- Wang Yue, the two-year-old girl who was left for dead on a narrow street in southern China after a hit-and-run accident, has died. The toddler, nicknamed Yueyue, had been cared for in a hospital in Guangdong province since she was injured a week ago. She succumbed to severe injuries Friday morning. Two hit-and-run drivers ran over Yueyue, one after another, after she wandered into the alley outside her father's hardware store. Both fled the scene but are now under arrest. But there was one thing more shocking than the double hit-and-run: the seeming apathy by pedestrians, cyclists and drivers—18 of them—who did not stop to help. Yueyue laid motionless in the street for 10 minutes until Chen Xianmei, a 58-year-old woman who collects trash for a living, passed by. She moved her to safety and called for help. A security camera captured the incident on tape. After the video was posted online, Yueyue's plight prompted sympathy, outrage and debate in and outside China. How could 18 people pass by the critically injured child and do nothing? The incident has also prompted widespread soul-searching in China about the state of the nation's morality and civic-consciousness. Why is it so difficult for Chinese nowadays to be a Good Samaritan? There are many possible explanations and many possible culprits. Some blame it on the lack of laws and regulations. Others argue it's caused by the failure of China's education system to inculcate respect for human life and dignity. Still others blame it on what some call ""jingshen kongxu"", or spiritual vacuum. As the country's 1.3 billion people compete to make money and climb the economic and social ladder, experts say, many people find themselves spiritually adrift. Reynard Hing, an astute China-watcher, cautions against making sweeping conclusions. ""It's funny how many people read into this, to the point that anti-Chinese sentiment arises,"" he wrote me. ""This situation is not unique to China."" He cites the case of Kitty Genovese. In 1964, the woman in Queens, N.Y. was chased and stabbed to death by an assailant over the course of half an hour while 38 of her neighbors watched from their windows and did nothing to help. Psychologists, Hing tells me, have dubbed this phenomenon the 'bystander problem'—the one factor that would predict Good Samaritan behavior was how many witnesses there were to a tragic event: The more bystanders, the less likely someone will step up to help. I asked Xia Xueluan, a socio-psychology professor at Peking University, about the seeming callousness of the 18 passersby. One factor is the district where it occurred, which has a concentration of hardware stores like the one Yueyue's father owns. ""(They) are owners of hardware stores originally from different parts of China who hardly know each other. Together they comprise a 'strangers' society', instead of one made up of real friends and acquaintances, or the ""acquaintances' society'."" Xia said the two sub-groups are fundamentally different. ""In an 'acquaintances' society',"" he explained, ""their relationship is of intimacy, trust and interdependence. In the 'strangers' society' it is characterized by estrangement, distrust, and independence. In such a society, it is not surprising to see incidents like this."" James Feinerman, a law professor at Georgetown University likewise cites the changes brought about by rapid urbanization. ""In big cities, where many people have moved in from outside, where there are thousands of newcomers from the provinces, there's a feeling that you are better off just leaving people you don't know alone,"" he said in a CNN interview. Other observers blame the incident on a breakdown in public trust. A joint survey by three universities in Beijing revealed that the root cause of people's reluctance to help others in need is a lack of trust among residents. Only about 8% surveyed said they still strongly trust other people. Should an elderly person in need be helped? Over 60% of the respondents said ""yes"", but more than 84% also believed it is too risky; recently in China, there have been several cases of individuals who faked injuries only to sue those who come to their aid. In 2006, an old woman in the eastern city of Nanjing was injured after rough jostling at a bus stop. Peng Yu, a young man and fellow passenger, offered help and even took her to the hospital. Later, however, the old woman and her family sued him in court, which eventually ruled that Peng Yu should pay 40% of the medical costs. Similar cases have happened in recent years. ""There must be something wrong when it is considered risky to be a Good Samaritan,"" China Daily wrote in an editorial this week. ""Apathy and distrust are the last things a harmonious society needs. It is imperative that we find a way to protect Good Samaritans from being wronged."" Peking University's Xia Xueluan calls this the ""interpersonal trust crisis"". He explains: ""This kind of crisis is highly contagious and could deteriorate due to lack of legal support. As a netizen puts it, it's not that the good people can no longer be found in our society. It's that nobody can afford to do good deeds—the price can be too high."" Days after Yueyue's tragic accident, millions of China's micro-bloggers are still pouring out their anger and frustration. ""After Peng Yu's case, if you were the first to find Yueyue after the accident, would you rescue her?"" Netizen Yi Jingge wrote. That is a question many in China are now asking themselves.","A 2-year-old toddler in China died after being hit by two separate cars .

"(CNN) -- The American Academy of Pediatrics on Monday called for an overhaul of the 35-year-old federal law governing toxic chemicals in the environment, saying it fails to safeguard children and pregnant women. ""It is widely recognized to have been ineffective in protecting children, pregnant women and the general population from hazardous chemicals in the marketplace,"" the academy said in a policy statement that will be published in the May issue of the journal Pediatrics. The American Medical Association, the American Public Health Association and the American Nurses Association have previously called for changes in the Toxic Substance Control Act. Toxic chemicals finding their way into the womb . Among the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations: . -- The consequences of chemical use on children and their families should be ""a core component"" of the new chemical policy. -- Chemicals should meet standards similar to those required for new drugs or pesticides. -- Decisions to ban chemicals should be based on reasonable levels of concern, rather than demonstrated harm. -- The health effects of chemicals should be monitored after they are on the market, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency should have the authority to remove a chemical from the market if it's deemed dangerous. Since the Toxic Substances Control Act took effect in 1976, the EPA has tested only 200 of the 80,000 chemicals in commerce and regulated just five. ""Right now, a company manufactures a chemical and puts it out on the market and reaps the economic reward,"" said Dr. Jerome Paulson, lead author of the policy statement. ""And then the public is responsible for trying to figure out if there is any harm associated with the use of that chemical. And then it's almost a criminal procedure, requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt."" 5 toxics that are everywhere:Protect yourself . Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey this month introduced the Safe Chemicals Act of 2011. The law would require chemical manufacturers to demonstrate the safety of industrial chemicals used in everyday household products. The American Chemical Council, the industry trade group, acknowledges the 1976 act needs to be updated. ""We agree that the Toxic Substances Control Act needs to be modernized to further ensure the safe use of chemicals and the innovation of new products,"" Scott Jensen of the American Chemical Council wrote in a statement to CNN. ""Chemicals should be safe for their intended use and potential risks faced by children should be an important factor in safe use determinations,"" he added. Children face special risks because they eat, drink and breathe more pound for pound than adults, and they spend more time on the floor or the ground than adults, a possible source of exposure, the American Academy of Pediatrics pointed out in its policy statement . Also, the pediatricians' organization noted, exposure to toxic chemicals in the environment can hurt fertility. For example, one study found women exposed to higher levels of the flame retardant polybrominated diphenyl ether took significantly longer to get pregnant. As part of its policy statement, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended its 60,000 member pediatricians familiarize themselves with the potential adverse health effects of chemicals in the environment. The American chemical industry is a $674 billion enterprise, employing 800,000 people, according to the industry group. Chemical manufacturers reported annual production volume of 27 trillion pounds, according to the most recent EPA data available.","1976 act on toxic chemicals too weak, doctors group says .

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- The first days of the protests in Egypt were torture for Hala Elnaggar. ""I waited two days and I finally heard my mom's voice,"" says Elnaggar, who lives just outside of Philadelphia with her husband, Ahmed. ""And of course when I heard her voice I started crying, and screaming 'come home.'"" Her parents, Nafussa and Farouk Osman, live half the year in New Jersey, and the other half in Cairo, just 20 minutes from Tahrir Square, the epicenter of recent protests. After days of not hearing from her parents, her worry turned to frustration. Random families answered her repeated phone calls because the telephones were getting crossed, she says. ""I kept calling and calling,"" says Elnaggar, the youngest of three children, and the only one of her siblings to be born in the United States. ""I had to purchase a calling card and that was the only way I could get through."" Elnaggar's parents immigrated to the United States with only $45 to their name more than 30 years ago. They were in Cairo when the protests broke out, and have decided to remain in Cairo. ""She doesn't want to come home,"" Elnaggar says, referring to a recent phone conversation she had with her mother. "" 'We need peaceful democracy Hala,' that's all she kept saying. 'It's a revolution and we want peaceful democracy. And I'm going to stay until its finished.' "" People across Egypt took to the streets on January 25 in demonstrations against corruption and failing economic policies partly inspired by similar January rallies that erupted in Tunisia. Since the protests began, President Hosni Mubarak --  in power since 1981 -- has appointed a vice president for the first time, reshuffled his Cabinet and announced that he won't seek a new term in September. As the chaos enters its third week, Elnaggar's daughter, Rhonda, eagerly awaits her grandmother's return. ""I just wish she was here. Even though it's crazy, she doesn't want to leave, I don't get why, but she doesn't want to go,"" she says. Rhonda says she supports the protesters, but not the violence. ""I would rather them not be violent, and, I am worried about my family. This is an extremely serious thing. They (the people) don't act like this,"" she says. ""So, I was surprised and worried."" A sophomore at Temple University, Rhonda first read about the protests on Twitter where she learned the internet was being shut down. As the events escalated and gained more international interest, she was overwhelmed by the onslaught of questions from classmates. ""It's sad that people really didn't know anything about the way it was before. But I'm hoping this (uprising) will implement and bring changes for the better,"" she says. Rhonda's brother Sherif, a freshman at Temple, says he would be among the protesters if he were in Egypt. ""Fighting for a free democracy is something that's great, they definitely deserve the right to do that,"" he says. ""I feel like they should be protesting, they should be fighting for their county to get better, they should be wanting things to get better, because they deserve it, they want a better life."" A better life is what Hala and Ahmed Elnaggar were looking for when they came to the United States. The couple constantly stressed how blessed the family was to live in America, and told the children to take advantage of the opportunities before them, she says. When things in Egypt began to settle down a bit last week, Hala said her parents tried to ease her fears by talking about everyday events. ""My mom said that the rabbits had 12 babies, and the pigeons had six babies, and the German shepherd is pregnant. So, that's my conversation with them, other than that, she says nothing to worry about,"" Elnaggar says, letting out a loud laugh. Joking aside, she knows the seriousness of the events. The uprising is long overdue, she says. ""It's a blessing in disguise what's going on, this needs to be done,"" she says.","Hala Elnaggar's parents split their time between Cairo and New Jersey .

"(CNN) -- Luke, a white seventh grader, believes his parents would not be supportive if he dated an African-American girl. ""Honestly I don't think my parents would be too happy because ... if you marry a black girl, you're connected to their family now,"" he said, adding, ""and who knows what her family is really like?"" Jimmy, a black seventh grader, recounted that after he had several white girlfriends, his parents seemed to interpret it as an affront to his own race. ""They said, 'Why not your own kind?' because all my girls have been white,"" he said, adding, ""it's not like they were like, 'You need to choose a black girl,' it's just they were asking me why I like white girls and I was just like, 'there's no ... specific reason.' "" Their stories highlight a divide not between the races, but between the generations. Both teens participated in an Anderson Cooper 360° study on children and race. Many students reported discouragement of interracial dating from their parents, or those of their friends, with reactions ranging from wariness to outright forbiddance. The architect of the AC360° study, renowned child psychologist Dr. Melanie Killen, says parents of both white and black kids have a lot of anxiety about the prospect of interracial dating. Killen, who was hired as a consultant for the study, contends the trepidation from parents can have a profound negative effect on their children's friendships and racial attitudes as a whole. ""Parents of young children do often send messages about, 'We can all be friends ... with everybody,' ... but by adolescence, they start getting more nervous about this and they start thinking, 'Well you should be friends with people like you or like us,' "" said Killen. She added that parents' ultimate fear is often that their children will marry another race. While interracial couples are a source of conflict for some families, interracial marriage is on the rise in America. According to a recent report by the Pew Research Center using the most recent Census data, 8.4% of marriages are interracial compared to just 3.2% in 1980 and in 2010, a full 15.1% of all new marriages were interracial. Anderson Cooper and Soledad O'Brien interviewed a panel of parents whose children participated in the AC360° study and were vocal about the issue of interracial dating. The father of Luke, the white middle-schooler, said his son might have gotten the wrong impression from a conversation he and his wife had with Luke's older sister. AC 360° Blog: Full ""Kids on Race"" coverage . ""She informed me she had started going out with an African-American ... young man at her school. A young man that we knew, and that we liked a lot and it wasn't that we didn't so much want them dating because of race per se. We didn't know if she had really thought about some of the cultural differences that there may be and so we talked about it in that respect ... not that it's right or wrong, good or bad, just different,"" said Luke's father Gary. He also admitted that the issues facing friends in interracial marriages were at the forefront of his mind. ""They have great marriages. They also have shared challenges at times. Challenges in the way the families may relate, challenges that they themselves may have either between themselves or the perception of other people ... we've talked about those kind of things because they're real,"" said Gary. The father of Jimmy, the black teen, said he's supportive of his son dating girls of any race but his son's slew of white girlfriends did get him concerned. ""When you see your kid always steering towards a different race, you want to make sure that he doesn't have a problem with his own race ... because we'd never seen him with a black girlfriend,"" said Jimmy's father, also named Jimmy. Another black seventh grader who participated in the study, 13-year-old Chantay, admitted she, and others in her extended family, had a double standard regarding interracial dating. ""If I were to date a white guy, a lot of people wouldn't really have a problem with that. But if my brother were to bring home a white girl, there's definitely going to be some you know controversy,"" she said, adding, ""I think its more of a problem for people when a black man brings home a white woman because it's been like that for years."" Chantay's mother Christal says she'd support her children dating any race but thinks her daughter's issue reveals concerns about whether black men view black women as inferior. ""I think when she speaks about if her brother were to bring home a white girl, what it says I think to our kids, our black kids, is, 'Are we not good enough for our black brothers? What's wrong with us? What, do you like the silky straight hair? I can press my hair,' "" said Christal. As for the parents who spoke to Cooper and O'Brien, they said hearing their children's thoughts on interracial dating was revelatory and would spark more conversations at home. For Killen, raising these issues in parents' minds is essential because they can have unintended long-term consequences. She says perceived discouragement of interracial dating can, ""contribute to more negative messages about being friends with people of different racial or ethnic backgrounds,"" adding, ""then that sets in a whole set of expectations that could be lifelong.""

"(CNN) -- For Paul Martin, fascinating history is a loud discovery in a quiet library. The stories sneak up on him while he's on other quests, such as the time Martin was trying to find the first American awarded a military medal and found Hercules Mulligan, a forgotten spy who saved George Washington's life twice. Martin has collected the stories of 30 Americans left out of the history textbooks in his new book, ""Secret Heroes: Everyday Americans Who Shaped Our World."" Some other characters Martin brings to life include Henry Beachell, whose invention of ""miracle rice"" fed and supported Asia, Cynthia Ann Parker's steadfast endurance of 24 years of Native American captivity and Jonathan Letterman, whose medical organization on the battlefield revolutionized the treatment of wounded soldiers and saved countless lives during the Civil War. ""These characters were relatively unknown, but what they did has had ripples that continue to affect us,"" Martin said. ""Hercules Mulligan saved the life of the father of our country. Think of what would have happened if he hadn't been a tailor in New York City. ""Everyday Americans have had a huge impact on our history -- it isn't always presidents and generals who set the course for the country."" The characters called to him from the pages of history books, whispered from brief mentions of TV shows and clambered from the pages of historical society records, all begging to share their stories with someone who would listen. ""Secret Heroes"" is the latest offering in a continuous genre of books that aim to remind us of our forgotten past and changes how we understand it. Martin has lived through history and has been captivated by it. He worked as a journalist during the Vietnam War, chronicling Vietnam's struggle to reconnect itself. Then he worked for the National Geographic Society for 30 years, the last 10 as executive editor for National Geographic Traveler. Throughout the years, a single running theme has connected his experiences: lifting the underdog. Unearthing forgotten stories from the country's founding is a way to remind us what everyday people are capable of accomplishing. But why do people care today? Kenneth C. Davis, author of the famed ""Don't Know Much About ..."" series and ""America's Hidden History,"" says that history isn't a dead thing of the past but an actively created and revised thing that affects our decisions every day. ""In school, we focus on the 'important people' and Founding Fathers, but what that 'great man version' of history does is really leave out an awful lot of people who have tremendous impact,"" Davis said. When Davis was in high school history class in 1968, women, African-Americans and Native Americans were noticeably absent from the textbook. Revisionism is a dirty word to some, but Davis said it's an important aspect of history. Teachers and textbook writers still struggle today to include ethnic heritage, but some school districts aim to keep the same version of history we've always been taught, case being Tuscon's suspension of Mexican-American studies. ""We need to revise history because we learn things all of the time about the stories and people who were left out,"" he said. This is especially the case in elementary school history classes, he said. Myths about George Washington chopping down a cherry tree are taught in the place of truth, so history starts on a shaky foundation of fiction, Davis said. Learning truth in the place of fiction later in high school makes history harder to grasp. ""People want to paint a picture of the past that is filled with pride and patriotism, especially for children, and that is a valuable thing,"" he said. ""It gives us a sense of national identity and character, but it creates a very false history that is sanitized of the stories that don't fit in neatly with the real history."" Retired American history teacher Jane Serkedakis watched textbooks change dramatically during her 33-year career. She doesn't believe that children are necessarily taught ""wrong"" information at a young age, she said, but there's an unbalanced emphasis on certain aspects of American history. ""It would be difficult to deal with third-graders and American history's real nuances of slavery,"" she said. ""It is in high school where we examine Thomas Jefferson as a paradox -- he owned slaves but was a complete champion of democracy. They aren't taught wrong, it's just that they can't go into all of that detail at such a young age."" The emphasis on military history consumes the curriculum for high school history classes. The emphasis turned off students who wanted to learn more than dates and battles; people, places and facts, not dates, make history come to life, Serkedakis said. In her Advanced Placement U.S. history class for 11th-graders, Serkedakis included a ""visitors"" assignment for each era, where students played the part of important figures in American history and brought them to life in the classroom. Books such as ""Secret Heroes"" can be a resource for teachers to use in this way, she said. It is this approach to teaching history that Rick Beyer, author of ""The Greatest Stories Never Told"" and ""The Ghost Army of World War II,"" finds most beneficial to students. Realizing that names and figures of the past were living, breathing human beings makes them as relatable as finding your grandfather's address in the newly released the 1940 census documents, he said. John Quincy Adams, son of second President John Adams, is a prime example, Beyer said. Fact tells us that Adams walked out of the White House and went skinny-dipping in the Potomac River each day. ""It doesn't change your understanding of American history, but suddenly that guy seems less like an old black-and-white photograph, and a little more like a person,"" Beyer said. ""If you restrict yourself to the Wikipedia version of history, you lose all of the color, delight and excitement of the adventure that is the lives of each one of these people."" Because history is everything that ever happened, from every war to every love affair, the untold stories that turn expectations upside down are the ones worth exploring, Beyer said. And because what we care about at 26 or 36 differs greatly from the portrait of our interest at 16, discovering history for the first time a decade or two after high school can make those stories even more important. That is what Davis, Beyer and Martin aim to remind us with their books, bursting with the people and places lost to time and rekindled in lifelike detail. Every good story is one worth retelling, and our own history is full of them, many filled with the undeniable spirit and tenacity of the patriotic principles we learn from myths. ""There really are two large categories of heroes,"" Martin said of his book's title. ""Most of us think of someone as a hero who risks his or her life when there is some immediate danger -- a soldier rescuing a fellow on the battlefield. ""But the other type of hero is one who simply perseveres, who overcomes overwhelming odds, even if it might take an entire lifetime.""","Authors: Everyday Americans have influenced history as much as presidents, generals .

"(Mother Nature Network)  -- The phrase ""organic farming"" was coined in 1940 by Lord Northbourne, a British author and Olympic athlete who helped launch the organic movement. Joined by fellow organic pioneers like J.I. Rodale, Lady Eve Balfour and Albert Howard, he championed farms as natural ecosystems, and railed against chemical fertilizers and pesticides. ""The farm itself must have a biological completeness,"" he wrote. ""It must be a living entity ... which has within itself a balanced organic life."" Those words still resonate with many farmers and shoppers today, however, they were drowned out for decades by famine. Earth's human population grew 293 percent in the 20th century -- compared with an average of 22 percent each of the previous nine centuries -- and farmers couldn't keep up. As hunger spread, an Iowa agronomist named Norman Borlaug came to the rescue in the early 1940s, using man-made pesticides, fertilizers and crossbred crops to start the Green Revolution, which saved countless lives and won him the 1970 Nobel Prize. MNN: How to cut costs when shopping at the farmers market . It also highlighted a common critique of organic farming: It's already hard to feed billions of people, even without rules against spraying chemicals or swapping genes. Borlaug's methods often raised yields while reducing acreage, and it seemed for years he'd proven the organic movement wrong. But ""chemical farming,"" as Lord Northbourne called it, lost some luster when synthetic pesticides and fertilizers were linked to environmental ills like cancer, blue baby syndrome, dying eagles and dead zones. Ecologists warned of gene pollution from genetically modified organisms, and overuse of livestock antibiotics was widely blamed for drug-resistant ""superbugs."" This created an opening for organic farming in the late 20th century, and today there are an estimated 1.4 million organic farms worldwide, including some 13,000 certified in the U.S. Yet despite these gains, organic farms still struggle to match the output of conventional ones -- no small detail since there are now about 6.9 billion people on Earth, three times the 1940 population. And with that number forecast to hit 9 billion by 2050, the future of organic farming remains unclear. MNN: Farms of America from the 1930s and '40s . It seems especially murky during economic dips like the recent recession, when higher-priced products of all kinds tend to suffer. But does organic food's premium price translate into any real health or environmental benefits? Critics like Alex Avery don't think so -- the conservative author and researcher has compared ""organic-food fanatics"" to the terrorist group Hezbollah, and wrote a book in 2006 called ""The Truth About Organic Foods"" that, according to his website, ""strips bare organic myths."" While supporters say organic farming merely reveals the true cost of food, Avery and other critics say it makes food unaffordable. Aside from supporting synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, they've focused their ire lately on critics of genetically modified organisms. ""For nearly a decade these agri-extremists have attempted to totally block agricultural biotechnology,"" Avery wrote in 2003, calling GMOs ""the most important and critically needed agricultural advance in human history."" A brief history of organic farming . Early farmers had no choice but organic farming, and they still achieved some major milestones over the years, like taming the first grains in Mesopotamia or turning a thin grass called teosinte into plump, protein-packed corn. Agriculture has stayed largely organic for most of its 10,000-year history, from the first Fertile Crescent plots to the plantations of colonial America. Some plants would control pests and soil quality naturally, and humans helped by rotating their crops; if extra fertilizer was needed, manure usually filled in. But some farmers used toxic additives as early as 4,500 years ago, when Sumerians dusted crops with sulphur to kill insects. Within a few centuries, the Chinese were killing lice with heavy metals like arsenic and mercury, a strategy later applied to crop pests. MNN: Where to find coupons for organic or natural products . Arsenic remained king of bug killers from medieval times up to the mid-1900s, when science found something more effective. DDT had been created in 1874, but it was overlooked as an insecticide until 1939, when Swiss chemist Paul Müller made a world-changing discovery that won him a Nobel Prize. German chemists had already invented a process by then for synthesizing ammonia to make nitrogen fertilizers, for which they also won Nobel Prizes. Borlaug then mixed these and other modern tactics to fight famines in Mexico, India and the Philippines, securing his own place in history. Meanwhile, a rival revolution still simmered below the surface, advocating ancient tools like compost and cover crops. It was led in the U.S. by magazine magnate and Rodale Institute founder J.I. Rodale, who popularized organic farming in the 1960s and '70s as environmental attitudes were already in flux. When Congress officially defined ""organic"" in 1990 and set up national certification rules, it quickly triggered an organic bonanza. USDA-certified acreage grew by an average 16 percent a year from 2000 to 2008, and still grew 5 percent in 2009 even amid the recession, points out U.S. National Organic Program spokeswoman Soo Kim. ""I'm no forecaster,"" she says, ""but I'd have to say there's a strong demand for it, and I would expect that to continue.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A police officer in Fullerton, California, whom an attorney accuses of brutality in the death of a homeless man this summer and two arrest cases last year, has been placed on paid leave, a police spokesman announced Friday. Sgt. Andrew Goodrich identified the officer as Kenton Hampton, but he declined to confirm whether Hampton is among six officers involved in the arrest of Kelly Thomas, a 37-year-old homeless man who died five days after allegedly being beaten by police this summer. That death is under investigation by the FBI and the Orange County District Attorney. But Hampton was involved in two incidents last year in which two men are accusing Hampton of brutality and false arrest, Goodrich told CNN. ""I can't comment as to the type of leave or the reason or the length,"" Goodrich said of Hampton being placed on paid leave. In making the announcement Friday, Goodrich declined to state when the leave became effective. Hampton and his attorney couldn't immediately be reached for comment Friday. Goodrich confirmed that Hampton was the officer involved in a new allegation of brutality made Friday by Edward Miguel Quinonez, 27, of Anaheim, California, who is planning to file a lawsuit against Hampton for ""slamming"" his head against a wall in a June 27, 2010, incident. His attorney, Garo Mardirossian, who's also the lawyer in the two other alleged brutality cases, announced the plans in a press conference Friday. Fullerton police investigated a police misconduct complaint filed by Quinonez shortly after the arrest, Goodrich said. ""That complaint was investigated, and there was a disposition on the complaint, and I can't talk about the disposition,"" Goodrich said. Quinonez's case marked the third case of alleged brutality by the Fullerton police. Those three accusations emerged this summer in the wake of the death of Thomas, a homeless man who was diagnosed as a schizophrenic. Quinonez accused Hampton of assaulting him and falsely accusing him of being drunk in public, said Mardirossian. Coincidentally, Quinonez happened to be one of about 100 witnesses to the police struggle with Thomas and even saw Hampton's involvement in that incident, Quinonez said. Quinonez was interviewed by prosecutors investigating the homeless man's death, his attorney said. In the 2010 incident, the officer was writing a ticket to a motorist for bouncing his lowrider and displaying its hydraulics as Quinonez happened to be on the sidewalk, waiting outside a bar, Quinonez told reporters Friday. The officer told Quinonez not to interfere with the investigation, and Quinonez then responded: ""Get away from me because cops killed my dad,"" who was shot to death by Riverside, California, police on September 1, 2008, Quinonez said. That remark was apparently interpreted by the officer as ""contempt of cops,"" Mardirossian said. The Fullerton officer then arrested Quinonez and slammed his head against the wall, Quinonez said. A blood test later showed that Quinonez had no alcohol in his system at the time of the arrest, he and his attorney said. Quinonez filed a police misconduct complaint just days after the incident, but he said he didn't know if anything ever became of the complaint, though he made several follow-up phone calls. ""As it says on the side of the patrol car, they are there to serve and protect us, not harass us,"" Quinonez said. ""He acted out of the heat of passion by throwing that charge at me, which was very unethical for him to have done, to take his personal issues out on me. ""He threw handcuffs on me and he slammed my head up against the wall, and he applied pressure to my head, which made my head hurt worse,"" Quinonez said. The officer spoke in ""like a sarcastic tone when I asked him what I was going to jail for, and he laughed and said, 'drunk in public.' He had to think about it."" The other two instances of alleged police brutality occurred after Quinonez's complaint, he said. ""If they would have taken care of the matter when I filed the complaint, then this wouldn't have happened,"" Quinonez told reporters, referring to the two other alleged instances of brutality. During the press conference, Quinonez was seated next to another alleged victim of police misconduct, Veth Mam, who is suing the Fullerton police for an incident that occurred four months after Quinonez's experience. Added Mam: ""If (Fullerton police) would have taken action on (Quinonez's) behalf, I probably wouldn't be in this mess, and Mr. Kelly Thomas wouldn't have passed away."" Mardirossian, who's the attorney representing the alleged victims in all three instances, said the cases show ""a pattern"" of police misconduct. ""We need to identify rogue cops and get them off the street. These few bad apples give the entire department a bad name,"" he said. In the Thomas incident on July 5, Quinonez happened to witness police ""beating on Kelly Thomas"" as Quinonez was boarding his bicycle on a bus near the altercation, he said. Quinonez said he heard Thomas crying for his father, Ron, who also was at Friday's press conference. As he witnessed the encounter between police and Kelly Thomas, Quinonez saw the same officer from his arrest ""walking up, and that's when the whole beating process started"" in the Thomas arrest, Quinonez said. The officer was also allegedly involved in a third case of suspected police brutality last year in which Mam, 31, of Baldwin Park, California, has filed a civil lawsuit against Fullerton police, said Mardirossian. Mam's altercation with Fullerton police officers was recorded on his iPhone and posted on YouTube. Mam wasn't seriously injured, Mardirossian said. During the early morning hours of October 23, 2010, Mam was recording the arrest of a friend on his iPhone camera. Instead of documenting what Mam described as a case of excessive force, the 31-year-old factory worker was himself arrested and charged with assaulting a Fullerton police officer. Last month, Mam filed a civil lawsuit, claiming that Hampton and other officers falsely arrested him, conspired to violate his civil rights and committed perjury during his misdemeanor trial. Mam, who lives with his girlfriend in nearby El Monte, was acquitted of battery against an officer and resisting arrest last month. On Friday, police spokesman Goodrich confirmed that Hampton was one of the officers involved in Mam's arrest. Fullerton acting Police Chief Kevin Hamilton has launched an internal affairs investigation into the incident, and police have said there is ""a strong possibility"" they wrongly arrested Mam, a spokesman said. In the Thomas case, medical records made public this month by Madirossian show that Thomas died from brain injuries as a result of head trauma. The records were compiled by physicians at the University of California Irvine Medical Center while Thomas remained on life support after the violent struggle. ""By the time he got to the hospital he was already brain dead,"" Mardirossian said earlier this month. Thomas was a diagnosed schizophrenic who was homeless at the time of the altercation, his attorney said. The medical records showed that Thomas suffered blunt head trauma with multiple broken bones in his face, and with rib fractures, according to Mardirossian. Thomas died five days after what the Orange County district attorney has called ""a violent and desperate struggle"" with Fullerton police. Thomas was shocked multiple times near his chest cavity and on his back with a Taser stun gun, said Mardirossian. According to the medical records, Thomas also suffered nose and brain trauma, and smashed cheekbones. Mardirossian claimed that officers used their Taser guns to deliver some of the head and face blows. The examination also concluded that Thomas had no narcotics or prescription medications in his body, Mardirossian said. Several bystanders witnessed the encounter and others recorded portions of the beating on cellular phones, according to Mardirossian. According to the medical report, Thomas suffered severe internal bleeding. ""The medical evidence will show that all that blood is what he ended up choking on,"" the attorney said. Thomas' father, Ron, who once worked briefly as a law officer, has filed a claim against the city of Fullerton. The Orange County Coroner's office has not determined the official cause of death, pending toxicological findings, officials said. The Fullerton police department has declined to comment about the medical reports. Since the Thomas incident, six officers allegedly involved have been placed on involuntary paid administrative leave. City officials have not released their names. Police Chief Michael Sellers has taken a paid medical leave, and two of the city's five council members have called upon him to resign. Meanwhile, there are two external investigations into the death by the FBI and the Orange County district attorney's office. The FBI is looking at possible civil rights violations. The Thomas incident began when police responded to reports that a man was trying to break into cars near a bus depot three blocks from City Hall. Following the beating, there was no evidence that vehicles were burglarized nor was Thomas in possession of any stolen property, according to Mardirossian. CNN's Stan Wilson contributed to this report.","Officer Kenton Hampton is accused of brutality in three arrest cases, an attorney says .

"Perugia, Italy (CNN) -- Police forensic scientists involved in the Amanda Knox murder case made a series of glaring errors during their investigation, according to court-appointed experts who testified Monday in her appeal. Knox, 24, was convicted and sentenced to 26 years in prison for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher, 21, who was found partially naked with her throat cut in her bedroom of the house the two shared. Knox and her former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 26, were convicted on two key pieces of evidence: a 30-centimeter (12-inch) kitchen knife and a clasp from Kercher's bloodied bra. Authorities testified in the original trial that Kercher's DNA was found on the blade of the knife, Knox's DNA was on its handle, and DNA from Sollecito was on the bra clasp. But in their appeal in Perugia, two independent, court-appointed experts -- professors Carla Vecchiotti and Stefano Conti -- were damning in their appraisal of the methods used by police forensic teams. Conti showed a brief clip of two officers collecting the bra clasp, pointing out how it had been found six weeks after the murder and in a different place. There were gasps from the public gallery as the two officers were seen picking up the clasp, passing it from hand to hand, dropping it, picking it up and then placing it on the floor again. Conti said that although gloves were worn, grubby dirt marks could clearly be seen on the thumb and forefinger of one of the officers. ""We can see from these circumstances proper protocol was not followed,"" he said. He also highlighted how the clasp had been placed into a plastic bag instead of a paper bag, saying the risk of contamination was ""significant"" as a result of how it had been collected. The experts said the clasp had been kept in such a poor way that it was covered in rust, and further testing was futile. They both stressed that they had worn masks, gloves, paper suits and used sterile knives and scissors during their retesting at Rome's La Sapinenza University. With regard to the knife, Vecchiotti said their test results were negative for blood and that the amount of DNA said to have been Kercher's was so low, it could not be examined again with any conclusion. The two said that, studying the original report, it was clear that ""numerous people had been in and out of the crime scene"" and that ""objects had been moved,"" which again put all evidence at risk of contamination. In a point-by-point deconstruction, the experts said that because of the errors made by police during the original investigation, the evidence against Knox and Sollecito should be considered ""inadmissible."" Knox and Sollecito listened intently as the experts put forward their case, bringing fresh hope to them that they will be freed when the court gives its verdict in September. During a break in proceedings, Knox's mother, Edda Mellas, said: ""To us this is not earth-shattering, because we have been saying it all along since the original trial, but it was just ignored. ""It really does beggar the question how they were found guilty in the first place when you see the mistakes that were made during the original investigation,"" she said. The hearing is scheduled to resume on Saturday. Kercher, a University of Leeds student from Coulsdon, Surrey, was discovered with her throat slit in November 2007, in the hilltop town of Perugia, just two months after she arrived in Italy during her year abroad. A third defendant, small-time drug dealer Rudy Guede, an immigrant from the Ivory Coast, was also jailed in connection with the brutal killing. He received a 30-year sentence for murder and sexual violence following a fast-track trial in October 2008. His sentence was later cut to 16 years. Knox and Sollecito -- who is serving 25 years -- were found guilty in December 2009.","Court-appointed forensic experts testify during appeal for Knox and her boyfriend .

"(CNN) -- If you told me eight years ago I'd end up writing an article extolling the virtues of Los Angeles, I would have laughed. I moved to the City of Angels in 2004 reluctantly. I had a great job offer for a newly minted position as the Supervising Producer of CNN's Entertainment Unit. There was just one problem: It was in L.A. Flash forward to 2012, and I proudly call Los Angeles home. But the road to loving my city certainly had its potholes and traffic jams. A sage Los Angeles resident offered some excellent advice that's useful for anyone contemplating a move: Don't come to a conclusion about a place before you've lived there at least a year. So I suspended judgment and decided to look at the city with fresh eyes. Here's what I saw: . In Southern California, you can view snow-capped mountains from a warm sandy beach. You can surf and ski or snowboard in the very same day, should you choose. Our city is defined and criticized for its car culture, but we have access to the most amazing surfing, biking and hiking trails in the Santa Monica Mountains and beyond. Deserts, old growth forests and lakes are all within easy reach. When people come to visit, I drop the top on my old convertible and take them up the Pacific Coast Highway into Malibu, through Topanga Canyon down the 101 (immortalized in the America song ""Ventura Highway"") into ""The Valley"" and then on to Mulholland Drive, where the winding road along a ridgeline provides breathtaking views. It's a trip that offers visitors an immediate snapshot and understanding that Los Angeles is not a flat, squalid concrete jungle. It has curves, sexy curves. Photos: The glamour of Los Angeles . Our incredible natural resources are only enhanced by our weather. The year-round warm temperatures draw visitors from around the world to our miles of golden, sandy beaches. Southern Californians love their bikes, motorized or otherwise. Readers of a certain age will remember the opening from the '70s sitcom ""Three's Company,"" where roommates Janet, Chrissy and Jack ride their bikes down a pathway on the beach in Santa Monica. I live 10 blocks from that very same bike path and love riding my beach cruiser to Venice for an icy cold beer at the Candle CafÃ© with good friends. Los Angeles is criticized for not having a defined city center, but I'd counter with the assertion that our many different ""centers"" are a positive. Each neighborhood has a distinctive flavor and appeal. The Hollywood Hills offers homes with little street appeal and amazing views. There's the always-posh Beverly Hills, and Silverlake and Los Feliz are hipster heaven, albeit hipsters with bank accounts. Brentwood seems to have its share of agents, psychiatrists and TV producer types. The beach vibe is like most coastal communities, relaxed and low-key. Westwood is packed with students, and driving down Western Boulevard through Koreatown, you're hard-pressed to find a sign in English. On the edge of Hollywood, Thai Town and Little Armenia merge and intertwine; the written languages, to my untrained eye, look similar. I shop in the Korean and Thai markets tucked away behind dazzling gold statues, and get the most amazing hummus and sujuk from an Armenian restaurant with the worst lighting. Speaking of food, Los Angeles' ethnically diverse population offers an incredible array of restaurants and eating experiences. You can get great BBQ in Koreatown, fabulous banh mi from a food truck, a steamy pupusa from a number of tiny strip mall restaurants, and homemade tamales from the guy who rolls his cooler down the street every Sunday morning yelling ""Tamales, tamales here."" Local food critic Jonathan Gold built his career chronicling L.A.'s diverse cuisine; he was the first food writer to win a Pulitzer Prize for criticism. On Sundays, the Hollywood Farmer's Market takes over two streets and four blocks. It's a great way to spend a morning strolling between stalls, choosing from produce that was picked just days before at the height of ripeness. I once heard an Aussie extolling the virtues of basil from a particular herb stand. I turned and realized it was the late Heath Ledger, with Michelle Williams, their new baby Matilda Rose and Jake Gyllenhaal. The very produce we ship across the nation is at our fingertips, and you can taste the difference. Not only are the vegetables lush, so is the vegetation. Outside my kitchen window is a Bird of Paradise. Most people see them in flower arrangements, but here it's the size of a small palm tree. Bougainvillea blooms year round, palm trees are everywhere dotting the skyline like enormous chrysanthemums and ficus trees reach the size of old growth oaks, reminding you that California is a very hospitable place to grow and bloom on many levels. Photos: Hollywood and beyond . If you happen to like sports, we have the Dodgers, and while the team has had its woes, my co-worker David Daniel (an L.A. native) reminds that ""they play in a real league without the designated hitter."" Speaking of baseball, CNN reporter Casey Wian loves the fact that the late Casey Stengel, the Hall of Fame manager of the Yankees, Mets and Brooklyn Dodgers, called Glendale home. Some will cite our lack of a football team, but if you're comparing us to New York, just remember that the Giants and the Jets both play in New Jersey. Oh, and let's not forget the Lakers, designated the most valuable NBA franchise by Forbes magazine. Their 16 championships, five of which came in this millennium, don't hurt either. When people judge Los Angeles, many criticize it for being plastic and fake. If you just scratch the surface of the city that might be all you see, but don't forget Los Angeles is home to an enormously creative population. Much of your entertainment is generated here. The musicians, artists, writers, producers, photographers and directors who call Los Angeles home also imbue the city with an incredible energy. It's palpable in our bars, restaurants and on our streets. It's infectious; we clap during credits at the end of movies because we know how much work goes into making that two-hour film and we applaud the effort. In Los Angeles, we know hard work, we know how to meet the deadline and we know how to get the job done. The difference here is that we just don't stress the journey. It may have a few potholes and traffic jams, but it also comes with a double helping of sun, sand, surf and smiles. The City of Angels is a heavenly place, and even though it's not for everybody, we're sort of happy to keep it that way. Are you a hardcore New Yorker or surfing Angeleno?

"(CNN) -- Jessa Balote is 14-years-old and training to be a professional ballerina in Manila. It is a task that takes enormous amounts of dedication for even the most determined of young women, but Balote's challenge is nothing compared to life outside the dance studio where she has to support her entire family. ""I'm the only one they expect to bring the family out of poverty,"" she says. Balote is one of 54 students enrolled in ""Project Ballet Futures,"" a program run by Ballet Manila to provide free ballet training to children from some of the city's most deprived neighborhoods. Balote lives in Tondo, a slum built next to a major waste dump in Manila. Her parents make what little money they have by selling trash. If Balote was not involved in the dance program, she says she wouldn't be able to eat everyday. ""They want to earn money to be able to survive,"" says Lisa Macuja-Elizalde, founder of the program and the Philippines' first prima ballerina. She believes in her students, personally paying for their lessons and uniforms. Macuja-Elizalde's goal is to help these children become professional members of the company with incomes to match. They are among her most focused students, she says, not afraid to work hard and to push themselves and their bodies. The Philippines Community Fund, which runs a school for children in Tondo, provides the transport, chaperones and an extra meal for a number of the children. Jame Walker, founder of the Philippines Community Fund, describes just how daunting the obstacles are for dancers like Balote. ""They don't get a good night's sleep in a comfortable bed,"" she says. ""Every night they sleep on bare boards. Sometimes the rats nimble the hard skin on their feet."" Walker says the biggest challenge the students face is a mental one. They lack confidence and many believe they are not worthy of a different life. Balote is one of the success stories. She is now a company scholar and an official member of Ballet Manila, receiving a regular paycheck. She joined the company for a recent performance of ""Swan Lake"", a ballet she loves, she says, because it is a love story. It is unclear how many more children will be able follow in her footsteps. The Philippines Community Fund is having trouble financing the program and cut the provision of chaperones this year. Without help, Walker says, it may not be able to continue, a reality she'd rather not have to face. ""We have built up (the students') hopes and dreams for years now...for me it's unbearable to think about,"" she says.","Program run by Ballet Manila gives opportunities to children from slums .

"(CNN) -- After Tip O'Neill's ""All politics is local,"" Bill Clinton's quip ""It's the economy, stupid,"" is perhaps the most oft-quoted truism of modern American politics. But as times change, we should update our aphorisms accordingly. Just four years ago during America's presidential election, outsourcing to India and China's currency manipulation were the bogeymen, the former blamed for the loss of jobs and the latter for the weakness of exports. But increasingly the culprit is the robot. Automation now removes as many manufacturing jobs from the economy as outsourcing. Witness the U.S. Postal Service, which will have to cut 35,000 jobs by 2015, and how digitization has forced bookstore chains such as Borders into bankruptcy. China, once the beneficiary of offshored manufacturing, also now faces cheaper competitors in Asia and technology upgrades: Foxconn -- a subsidiary of Taiwan-based electronics supplier Hon Hai Precision Industry Co -- plans to implement more than one million robots on its assembly lines in China by 2015. We may compete against each other economically, but we are all competing with, and against, technology. An updated vocabulary for these circumstances might include the shift from homo economicus to homo technologicus. Even economists ought to agree. Marx and Engels wrote in the Communist Manifesto that it was constant changes in the ""instruments of production"" that caused ""all fixed, fast-frozen relations"" to be ""swept away."" For Schumpeter, technological change was a key driver of ""creative destruction."" Technology increases drive problems that we view as political or economic in nature such as income inequality. America's wealthiest people earn from their innovation and control of technologies, ranging from social media to high-frequency trading. If technology drives economics -- rather than the reverse -- then we should elevate the notion of geo-technology above that of geopolitics and geo-economics as well. It was around the time of then-candidate Bill Clinton's 1992 quip about the economy that scholars of international relations began to use the now vogue term ""geo-economics."" Edward Luttwak wrote that the logic of conflict would unfold in the ""grammar of commerce."" Samuel Huntington chided his fellow political scientists for not recognizing that ""economics is the most important source of power and well-being."" Today that same statement is true of technology. Think about it: China is not a superpower today because it has about twice as many nuclear warheads as it did two decades ago. Not many people know or care how many nukes China has; it has had them since the 1960s, yet we didn't consider China a superpower then. China's superpower rise is directly attributable to its technological strategy of dominating low-cost manufacturing, accumulating massive surpluses and reserves, and reinvesting that cash into more advanced technologies as well as military hardware. The causal flow begins with technology. By this logic, China's recent twelfth Five-Year Plan should be viewed as a more cogent national security strategy than anything offered by the Pentagon in two decades: it pledges $1.5 trillion in government support for seven ""strategic emerging industries"" including alternative energy, biotechnology, next-gen IT, high-end manufacturing equipment and advanced materials. China invented none of these fields, but is putting incomparable effort into deploying them at scale. China already controls over half the world's market in solar cells. Does the balance of power matter more, or the balance of innovation? Even though technology has become a scapegoat in American politics, it is also widely recognized as part of the solution. The internet creates 2.6 jobs domestically for each one that is lost to automation. The new great hope for a grassroots economic revival is the advent of 3D printing, which some call the ""next industrial revolution,"" for its potential to revive a nationwide DIY manufacturing movement. Small-scale prototypes can be produced in much smaller quantities, and bought and traded on increasingly popular websites like Etsy.com, which has over 15 million users and growing. Technology also enables the increasingly wide and liquid market for task bartering and skill exchanges: Amazon's Mechanical Turk is already the world's largest part-time workforce. The next wave of job creation could come from green construction, meaning retrofitting for low-emissions buildings and installing smart grid equipment such as solar cells and constructing wind farms. Our political discourse today obsesses over economic headlines at the expense of technological foresight. In America it passes as penetrating wisdom that Obama will be re-elected if unemployment drops below 8%. But America's structural unemployment won't be unwound by statistical sleights of hand. What every citizen and worker in the world today needs is not higher IQ or EQ but higher TQ: technology quotient. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ayesha and Parag Khanna.","Khannas: Technology now the most important source of power and well-being .

"(CNN) -- Prosecutors will appeal a 30-day jail sentence handed down Monday against Dharun Ravi, the ex-Rutgers student convicted of spying on and intimidating his gay roommate, who then killed himself by jumping off New York's George Washington Bridge. Middlesex County Prosecutor Bruce J. Kaplan said Ravi's crimes warranted ""more than a 30-day jail term"" and called Superior Judge Glenn Berman's sentence ""insufficient under the sentencing laws of this state, the facts that were determined by a jury and long-standing appellate precedent."" Calling the appeal ""a registering of outrage,"" CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin said there is ""very little chance"" the sentence will be overturned. He noted that under New Jersey law, the judge had the flexibility to sentence Ravi to anything from zero to 10 years in prison. ""The heart of this case was a paradox: Was this a prank that just got out of control after the fact, or was it a hate crime?"" Toobin said. ""He was convicted of a hate crime, but the judge really treated this like a prank."" Is 30-day sentence fair for student who bullied gay roommate? Under the sentence, Ravi will serve three years of probation and must complete 300 hours of community service aimed at assisting victims of bias crimes, according to Berman. He also must pay more than $11,000 in restitution. Berman stayed the jail sentence for 10 days pending expected appeals from the prosecution and the defense. The September 2010 death of Tyler Clementi, and Ravi's trial this year, thrust the issue of cyberbullying and prejudices against homosexuals into the national spotlight. Clementi, an 18-year-old freshman, plunged to his death into the Hudson River after learning Ravi had secretly spied via a webcam as Clementi kissed another man. Opinion: What the tragedy of Tyler Clementi teaches about teen sexting. ""I haven't heard you apologize once,"" Berman told Ravi, 20. He said Clementi ""placed his trust in you without any conditions, and you violated it."" Ravi, he said, acted out of ""colossal insensitivity."" Berman said he took Ravi's youth and his lack of a criminal record into consideration in determining the sentence. The judge told Ravi the only reason he did not recommend deportation was because the man involved in the videotaped encounter, identified in court only as ""M.B.,"" said in his victim impact statement he did not believe Ravi should be deported and would be willing to write a letter to that effect. Ravi could have faced 10 years in prison and deportation to his native India . Ravi's sentencing hearing stretched to nearly four hours Monday, punctuated by emotional victim impact statements by Clementi's parents and brother. ""My son Tyler was a kind and gentle soul,"" Joe Clementi said of his son. ""Nobody other than Tyler understood how vulnerable he was, but the fact is that he was very vulnerable -- and he was shaken by the cold, criminal actions of his roommate."" James Clementi recalled his brother's excitement about attending college. ""He could never have known the viper's nest he was walking into,"" he said. ""I have often found myself wondering if Dharun Ravi is even capable of empathizing with another person,"" the brother added. In his statement, ""M.B."" said, ""I do not mind that Mr. Ravi has never apologized to me for what he did and said, but I do wonder if it ever has entered his mind that he has caused me a great deal of pain and yet he knows nothing about me."" Ravi's parents also addressed the court, although he chose not to speak. ""Not a single day goes by we don't think about Tyler,"" said his father, Ravi Pazhani. But he said his son had been demonized and ""dragged through the mud."" ""How can a person who never acted as a bully ... go from a passive child to hardcore bully overnight?"" he asked. His mother, Sabitha Ravi, cried as she related the stress and pain her son has experienced since Clementi's death. ""He has been living in hell for the past 20 months,"" she said. Listening to her statement, Ravi grew tearful for the first time during the hearing. After his mother finished speaking, the two embraced as she sobbed. Michael Billy, a gay rights advocate and television producer who has hosted shows on PBS and SiriusXM radio, told HLN's Vinnie Politan he was ""physically disgusted"" by the 30-day sentence. ""Gay kids across the country need to get the message that their life matters,"" which the New Jersey native claimed is the opposite of what came across Monday. ""That is the message that is being sent: That we still do not take these things seriously,"" said Billy, lamenting that ""Tyler Clementi had no chance,"" though Ravi would get one. Though Ravi and Molly Wei -- a fellow student who admitted to joining Ravi to watch the surreptitious encounter that others were alerted to via social media -- were charged in the wake of Clementi's suicide, they were not charged directly with his death. Facing two counts of invasion of privacy, Wei reached a plea deal that required her to testify against her friend and former high school classmate as well as to complete a three-year program on cyberbullying and 300 hours of community service. Before sentencing Ravi, Berman said he was planning to terminate Wei's program early, noting that she testified candidly against Ravi although ""it was clear she didn't want to be here."" He said she had completed 250 hours of community service before her testimony. Ravi, who was studying on a visa at the New Jersey university at the time of the incident, turned down a plea deal offered by Middlesex County prosecutors. Under the terms of that offer, he would have avoided jail time in exchange for undergoing counseling, doing 600 hours of community service and disposing of any information that could identify the man who appeared in the Web video with Clementi. Prosecutors also offered to help Ravi avoid deportation, though they said they could not guarantee it. That set the stage for the trial, during which prosecutors argued that Ravi tried to embarrass Clementi because he was gay and that his actions were motivated by a desire to intimidate the Ridgewood, New Jersey, native expressly because of his sexual orientation. ""These acts were purposeful, they were intentional, and they were planned,"" prosecutor Julia L. McClure told the jury on the first day of the trial. Ravi ""was bothered by Tyler Clementi's sexual orientation,"" she later said more bluntly. Ravi's attorneys countered by portraying their client as an immature college student who made a mistake and insisting his actions were not based on homophobia. After more than three weeks in court, a jury on March 16 convicted Ravi of invasion of privacy, bias intimidation, witness tampering, hindering apprehension and tampering with physical evidence. Opinion: Bullying case calls for smarter sentence than 10 years in prison . Days after his conviction, Ravi told ABC television's ""20/20"" that he thought Clementi understood he ""wasn't trying to intimidate him and scare him because he was gay."" He also criticized the public portray of what happened. ""I felt like I was being used by everybody,"" said Ravi. ""They were taking revenge on me, even though what they think happened isn't what happened.""","NEW: There's ""very little chance"" the sentence will be overturned, CNN's Toobin says .

"(CNN) -- Mexico's foreign ministry has accused a U.S. border patrol agent of fatally shooting a Mexican citizen over the weekend. The shooting occurred near the bridge that connects Brownsville, Texas, with the Mexican town of Matamoros, the foreign ministry said Sunday in a statement condemning the violence. The ministry said a Mexican national died after being shot by the U.S. agent, but did not release details about the circumstances surrounding the Saturday violence. ""The Mexican government has repeatedly expressed that the disproportionate use of lethal force in the exercising of immigration control functions is unacceptable under any circumstance,"" the foreign ministry said, calling for a thorough investigation. A U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman said two agents fired shots Saturday morning during ""dangerous encounters"" along the border. The truth about the Fast and Furious scandal . But U.S. officials have not confirmed any deaths related to the shootings. ""We have been unable to establish a connection between the shootings and a victim reportedly admitted to a Matamoros hospital,"" U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman Bill Brooks said. Agents ""were involved in two dangerous encounters"" in the Rio Grande Valley Saturday morning, he said. In one incident, an agent fired toward someone who was throwing rocks at him, he said. ""At approximately the same time, another nearby agent observed a person aiming a weapon at him and fired his service weapon in defense,"" he said. The FBI is investigating, Brooks said. In 2010, the FBI investigated after a border patrol agent shot and killed a Mexican teen along the border between El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. Federal officials closed the case in April, saying there was not enough evidence to pursue charges against the officer and that he acted within the agency's policies for use of force. The officer received widespread condemnation from critics who questioned his use of deadly force against 15-year-old Sergio Adrian Hernandez Guereca, who authorities said had been throwing rocks at the agent when he was shot and killed. Opinion: Why 'illegal immigrant' is a slur . Hernandez had a history of involvement with human smuggling and was on a list of repeat juvenile offenders, U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman Mark Qualia told CNN after the shooting. An appeal is pending in a lawsuit filed by the teen's parents in U.S. federal court, accusing the officer of using excessive force. The Mexican government filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case last week, noting that its request to extradite the border patrol agent for prosecution had been denied. ""As a matter of international responsibility, the fact that the victim was on Mexican soil when he was killed does not absolve the United States of responsibility for the acts of its agent,"" the brief said.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The City Council of San Bernardino, California, declared a fiscal emergency ahead of a planned bankruptcy filing, a move that allows officials to bypass a 60-day mediation period with creditors that is mandated by the state. The seven-member council immediately followed the action Wednesday night by voting 5-2 to seek Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection. ""These votes mean that the City of San Bernardino will move forward with its plan to file for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection in approximately 30 days,"" according to a statement released by Andrea Travis Miller, the interim city manager. ""It does not mean the city will not negotiate in good faith with its creditors -- just that it may not complete those negotiations prior to the Chapter 9 filing."" Last week, Miller and Finance Director Jason Simpson issued a report stating that the city was facing insolvency and its expenditures are projected to exceed revenues by $45 million. The city's general fund reserves had been as high as $19 million in 2001 but are now depleted, the report said. Some $10 million to $16 million in annual revenue has evaporated in recent years as taxable sales dried up and property values plummeted in the city of 211,000 residents, the report said. San Bernardino is about 60 miles east of downtown Los Angeles. Prior agreements reducing city salaries are now ending, ""creating an increase in salaries and benefits of $10 million effective July 1, 2012, and increased costs in future years as merit increases resume,"" the report said. Despite negotiating tens of millions of dollars in concessions and reducing its work force by 20% over the past four years, San Bernardino would not have enough cash on hand to meet its obligations, according to the report. ""The city has reached a breaking point,"" the report said. San Bernardino continues to date to meet its financial obligations to vendors, creditors and employees, Miller said. San Bernardino would be the third California city to file for bankruptcy in the past few weeks. Many municipalities in the Golden State and around the nation are struggling to cover their costs as the economic malaise continues to hurt tax revenue streams, experts said. This will lead to more municipal bankruptcies, which have been rare until now. ""This is not the end. This is the beginning,"" Peter Navarro, business professor at University of California, Irvine, told CNN recently. ""As cities see it can be done and is being done, it will give them the idea to do it."" The town of Mammoth Lakes, California, sought protection July 2 after a property developer won a $43 million court judgment against the resort town of just over 8,000 residents. Experts say this filing should not be lumped in with the other two California towns since it was an unusual circumstance. The city of Stockton, however, filed for bankruptcy in late June after three months of mediation with creditors failed to close a $26 million budget shortfall. The city of 292,000 residents had already addressed $90 million in deficits over the past three years, mainly through reducing services and employee compensation. Both Stockton's and San Bernardino's fiscal troubles are due in large part to the massive housing downturn and recession that swept across California. Both towns were hit particularly hard by the foreclosure crisis, which left numerous abandoned homes and reduced property values in its wake. That led to lower property tax revenues, critical to supporting public services. Also, municipalities have struggled from budget changes made on the state level. Because of massive budget shortfalls, Gov. Jerry Brown and the state legislature made changes to vehicle tax money and redevelopment agencies that stripped locales of hundreds of millions in state funding. While some areas of the Golden State are starting to recover, the regions containing those two towns are not, said Chris McKenna, executive director of the League of California Cities. By filing for bankruptcy, cities will be able to keep police and firefighters on the street and possibly keep some parks and libraries open while they work out their finances, he said. More municipal bankruptcies are likely in California and throughout the nation, as cities continue to battle rising costs and a weak economy, said Eric Hoffman, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service. CNNMoney's Tami Luhby contributed to this report.","The City Council of San Bernardino votes 5-2 to pursue bankruptcy filing .

"(CNN) -- How many young people have gotten in trouble for something they've posted on Facebook? Maybe a party picture or an offensive comment compromised their chances at a job. But a 25-year-old Iranian says his Facebook activity has led to his father's detention in a notorious prison in Tehran. And now he's struggling to find a way to free him. ""I want my family to forgive me,"" Yashar Khameneh said. ""But I believe what I believe in."" A year ago, while studying at a college in Holland, Khameneh joined a Facebook page that made fun of a top Shiite Muslim imam, Ali al-Naqi al-Hadi. Naqi is one of 12 imams considered successors to the Prophet Mohammed. Called ""Infallibles,"" the imams are protected by law in Iran from ridicule or even frivolous comments. One can be arrested for insulting them. The Facebook page, dubbed the ""Campaign to Remind Shias about Imam Naqi,"" features a robed man, presumably Naqi, with a face like Charles Manson's, flanked by a camel wearing sunglasses and the donkey from ""Shrek."" It also shows a picture of a Shiite tomb that has been pooped on by a flock of pigeons. With more than 21,000 likes, the page explains, ""Our goal is to use satire to take out the superstition from religion."" ""We believe that everything and everybody could be the subject of a joke,"" Khameneh said. ""Nothing and nobody is too holy to be funny. At the beginning it was not that serious because it was a joke."" Syria tests internet freedom theory . Khameneh didn't know who the manager of the site was. They both used nicknames, as did many people who posted, Khameneh said. In the early days, though, Khameneh posted links to his personal Facebook page, which had his real name. ""I feel like that is how the authorities knew to come after me,"" Khameneh said. During that time, Khameneh said, he wasn't thinking too much about someone in the Iranian government seeing the page. It seemed unlikely: one page out of so many on Facebook. The thought did cross his mind a couple times that if it did become popular, it would probably upset some people back in Iran, where his father, mother and sister lived. But he kept posting on the page out of principle, he said. ""From the beginning, I knew that it could be dangerous, but the thing is this: Taboos should be broken,"" he said. ""I knew that it could be sensitive (for) Muslims and Iranians worldwide, but here in Europe, jokes are made -- jokes of Jewish stories or Christian -- and nobody is threatened or killed. This is how it should be."" A page's overnight fame . Khameneh took comfort, he said, that the page had a small number of followers. That changed this spring. Traffic skyrocketed in mid-May, when an Iranian rapper living in Germany made international headlines, Khameneh said. Iran's religious authority had placed a fatwa on the rapper's head for making a song that mocked the same imam. The song had gone viral. All of a sudden, people around the world were Googling the rapper and the imam. ""That was a boon for the (page),"" Khameneh said. ""It became famous."" On May 23, Khameneh got a call from his father, Abbas Khameneh, in Iran. ""He said, 'some people from the intelligence service had come (to our house), and they want you to cooperate,' "" Khameneh recalled. ""My father said, 'they want your passwords to your Facebook, web blog and e-mail.' "" The young man was frightened and felt trapped. First, he didn't manage the page and therefore couldn't take it down. He assumed that the Iranian authorities just didn't understand that. ""They came after me maybe because from the beginning, I was very active on the page, and you could tell that I had a close relationship -- commenting back and forth -- with the manager,"" he said. He fired off a Facebook message to the manager of the site, explaining the situation and asking that the page be taken down. The manager wrote back, refusing to deactivate the page. It's unclear exactly why the manager chose to keep the site up. But Khameneh thinks there are two reasons, both of them legitimate. Allowing Iran to succeed in taking the page down would be to defeat the very reason it was created: to challenge authority and create a greater sense of free expression. And it's possible that the manager suspected that Khameneh's e-mail was a fake and that the sender was actually someone with the Iranian authority trying to trick the manager into taking the page down, Khameneh said. ""At first, I was angry, but I was also emotional"" at the news that the page would stay up, Khameneh said. But ""I understand that taking the page down, really, wasn't going to help my father."" Can Facebook page help Israel, Iran toward peace? Password protection . Khameneh considered whether he should give up the passwords to the accounts he did control: his personal Facebook account and his e-mail. But he decided that wouldn't be wise. The Iranians could go through those accounts and find the names of his friends and other information, he feared. Khameneh seemed to be in an unwinnable situation. So he took the only action he could and deleted his e-mail and personal Facebook account. The page mocking the imam remained up. The day after his father called, Khameneh says, he got a call from his sister and mother in Iran. They were hysterical. They said Iranian authorities had arrested his father and taken him to Evin prison in Tehran, a lockup notorious for torturing inmates. Khameneh's sister begged him to give up his passwords. She pleaded for him to dismantle the Facebook page about the imam. He struggled to explain to her that he didn't control the page and that he had closed all the accounts that he could. He told her he had no options. ""She told me, 'As long as that Facebook page is open, your father will be in the same situation.' ""After a few days. I received another call, this time from my mother. She was crying. She told me, 'OK, you see they want to execute your father? Why don't you close that Facebook page?' ""At the same time, I can do nothing,"" Khameneh said. Weeks slipped by as Khameneh worried about what to do. By June, he decided to publish online an open letter, describing his father's arrest and explaining that he didn't know who operated the Facebook page. Staffers with the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, a nongovernmental organization based in the United States, saw that letter and called Khameneh to interview him, Executive Director Hadi Ghaemi said. Ghaemi said he feels confident the young man's story is true. ""It would be too dangerous for Khameneh's family in Iran for him to make up something like this,"" Ghaemi said. ""The burden of proof is (on) the Iranian government, and they haven't issued a statement or denied the story. It also fits a broader trend of Iranian intelligence targeting Iranian activists abroad and their family members."" He pointed to the Iranian rapper as an example and reported intimidation of Iran-based relatives of journalists who work for Radio Farda, the Persian-language service of Radio Free Europe. ""Employees of Radio Farda believe that their journalism, which attracts over 10 million page views monthly on Radio Farda's website, is the motive behind at least 20 incidents this year involving the interrogation and intimidation of their family members in Iran by officials of the country's Intelligence Ministry,"" according to a news release on the news outlet's site. Two accused of 'terrorism' via Facebook, Twitter . At a loss . Inside Iran, too, there's been an uptick in arrests of bloggers and journalists. According to the official news site of the Iranian government, the minister of culture ordered that ""current conditions require more unity (of views) in the media."" Mohammad Hosseini stated, ""There will soon be a conference"" with ""members of the media and officials of the economy sector"" to ""enhance their awareness regarding the current conditions of the country,"" so ""they can work while considering the country's national interests and to prevent individuals using their personal opinions which, sometimes inadvertently, leads to disturbing the (society's) atmosphere."" The minister said he was issuing a final warning to anyone who moved against ""national interests."" Attempts to find any reporting of Abbas Khameneh's arrest in state-run media were unsuccessful, as were efforts to reach top officials with the country judiciary or foreign ministry to confirm that the arrest took place. In Holland in late June, Yashar Khameneh was getting very worried about his father. ""I thought I should tell the public,"" he said. Khameneh began speaking to the media. This week, Khameneh said, he was at a loss. ""I don't know what else to do,"" he said. ""I don't know. I don't know. ""I can just hope."" Opinion: Did Facebook bring down Mubarak?

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Olympic Committee said Friday that the uniforms for the opening and closing ceremonies at the 2014 Olympic Winter Games will be made in the United States. The news came after it was revealed that American athletes at this year's games are going to be wearing clothing manufactured in China -- a fact that sparked outrage from some lawmakers and human rights activists. Ralph Lauren and the USOC were bombarded on Facebook and Twitter by critics who demanded the fashion design company manufacture new uniforms in the United States. From our readers: Forget uniforms, U.S. Olmypians should 'go naked' ""With athletes having already arrived in London, and the apparel distribution process beginning this weekend, we are unfortunately not able to make a change for London,"" USOC CEO Scott Blackmun said in a statement. ""We are absolutely committed, however, to working with our sponsors to ensure that the concerns voiced are addressed. To that end, Ralph Lauren has agreed to domestically manufacture Team USA's apparel for Opening and Closing Ceremonies for the 2014 Olympic Winter Games,"" he said. ""In the meantime, we ask for the American people's support. The members of Team USA have dedicated their entire lives to training for this one moment. They are some of the finest men and women this country has to offer and they are prepared to succeed both on and off the field of play in London. Our country should be proud of the individual athletes that will represent them in London and I'm hopeful that everyone will rally around Team USA,"" Blackmun said. Ralph Lauren similarly released a statement Friday, confirming it would manufacture uniforms domestically for the 2014 games. ""For more than 45 years Ralph Lauren has built a brand that embodies the best of American quality and design rooted in the rich heritage of our country,"" it said, promising to ""lead the conversation within our industry and our government addressing the issue of increasing manufacturing in the United States."" Previously, the USOC had defended the uniforms. In a statement Thursday, USOC spokesman Patrick Sandusky said that ""unlike most Olympic teams around the world, the U.S. Olympic Team is privately funded and we're grateful for the support of our sponsors."" He described the criticism as nonsense in a tweet. In testimony before Congress last year, the American Apparel and Footwear Association said that 98% of all apparel and 99% of all footwear sold in the United States are manufactured abroad. According to the Labor Department, 10 years ago, there were more than 350,000 Americans employed by apparel manufacturers. Last month, that number was 147,300. Dara Torres, a former American Olympic swimmer who won 12 medals in a span of 20 years, said the uniforms looked great but would be even better if they were produced domestically. ""Wearing the U.S. uniform, going out there to represent the United States, it would be nice if it was actually made in the United States,"" she said. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, told reporters Thursday that ""the Olympic committee should be ashamed of themselves."" ""I think they should be embarrassed. I think they should take all the uniforms, put them in a big pile and burn them and start all over again,"" he said. Kenya athletics brand has ambitions to take on Nike . ""If they have to wear nothing but a singlet that says USA on it, painted by hand, then that's what they should wear."" Actress and human rights advocate Mia Farrow took to Twitter to call on the designer to explain its actions: ""please will you tell us why the US Olympic uniforms are made in China? Why not made in the USA?"" Farrow, known for her advocacy on behalf of children, also called on the designer to heed Reid's call. ""Burn them & start all over. How bout it?"" she tweeted. At least one current Olympic athlete also raised questions about the uniforms. ""Our Ralph Lauren outfits for the Olympic opening ceremonies were made in China. So, um, thanks China,"" tweeted distance runner Nick Symmonds, who represents the best hope for the United States to medal in the men's 800-meters since the 1992 Games in Barcelona. The USOC is no stranger to controversy over its sponsorships, with questions being raised over why it opted last year to extend BP's sponsorship through the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games, following the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010. It was also questioned as early as the 2002 during the Winter Games in Salt Lake City about why American athletes donned berets made by Roots, a Canadian company. Ralph Lauren has designed uniforms for the 2010 Winter Games in Vancouver and the 2008 Summer Games in Beijing, and both times portions of the clothing were manufactured in China, according to previous CNN reports. The revelations about the 2012 uniforms, first reported Wednesday night by ABC News, come at a critical time as the United States grapples with a struggling economy that has hit the American textile industry hard. Muslim weightlifter's wish to dress modestly triggers debate . It also comes as House Democrats introduced a ""Make It In America"" jobs bill, which was first put forward in 2010 as a manufacturing jobs initiative. New York-based fashion designer Nanette Lepore, who boasts a ""Made In America"" collection, said she was disturbed by the news that the uniforms were made in China. ""It's very disturbing because it completely could have been manufactured here in the United States in New York City or in any other city where there's factories that still exist,"" she told CNN. ""And it's frustrating for us because it's a cause we've been fighting for, and we've been trying to raise awareness and trying to convince designers to move work back to our shores and stop off-shoring and start on-shoring. This would have been the perfect opportunity."" But free market advocates, such as the Cato Institute, say none of this is surprising. Globalization means manufacturing companies will be drawn to countries where the costs are lowest, according to Daniel J. Ikenson of the Cato Institute. ""When companies are able to outsource, they are able to produce most competitively. They're able to attend to their costs. And if they can do that, then they can deliver better quality, greater variety at lower prices for U.S. consumers,"" Ikenson said. The United States is not the only place where citizens have questioned the production of their Olympic uniforms. Headlines were made in Australia this year when it was revealed that Australian uniforms for the Olympics also were made in China. The Australian Olympic Committee responded to critics by saying it was not financially viable to make the outfits at home, according to local media reports. Some Canadian lawmakers became irate in 2008, when it was learned that Canadian uniforms for the Olympics in Beijing were made in China. American companies have made Olympic uniforms in the past, notably, Reebok, Levi's and Champion.

"(Time.com) -- On August 5, when a gunman drove to a Sikh temple outside Milwaukee and started shooting his 9mm handgun, some ran and some leapt to stop him. One of the six who died was temple president Santwat Singh Kaleka, who has been hailed as a hero by witnesses who say he tried to disarm the shooter. The first cop on the scene, Brian Murphy, took nine bullets as he also tried to help. Miraculously, Murphy wasn't killed. Why do some people confront danger while most scamper for the exits? Altruism emerges in many disasters. A few weeks ago, three women came forward to say they survived the cinema shooting in Aurora, Colorado, because their boyfriends shielded them. All three men are dead. In January, when the colossal cruiser Costa Concordia foundered on the western coast of Italy, a 57-year-old crewmember stayed aboard and helped others even as his captain -- and thousands of passengers -- abandoned ship. Thirty-two people died. Time.com: Sikh temple shooting: Wisconsin community reacts to shocking attack . The difficult thing about studying those who are altruistic during calamities is that most of them die. Also, we like to create heroes. As researchers Selwyn Becker and Alice Eagly pointed out in the journal American Psychologist in 2004, the idea of heroism exists in virtually every human culture ever recorded -- from cave paintings and folklore to the dawn of literature and right up to, say, ""The Dark Knight Rises."" President shares story of hero who tended to friend in theater shooting . Because heroism is so deeply valued, Becker and Eagly define it as not only noble risk taking but also something selfish, a way to ensure status. Earlier this year, the journal Evolutionary Psychology published a study by two psychologists who found that participants who were willing to endure pain -- having to put their hands into a tub of ice for 40 seconds, or being dunked into a tank of water -- were not only judged to be more likable, but also given significantly more money from an $1,170 pot that could be divvied up any way the other student volunteers wanted. The study was small -- 78 participants -- and none were threatened with death. But the authors concluded that ""engaging in 'self-sacrificial behavior' is a profitable long-term strategy."" In short, heroic and egotistical impulses can arrive at the same moment. But can we choose between them? Time.com: Colorado movie theater shooting: Remembering the victims . The U.S. Department of Defense has funded studies at Yale designed to examine the difference between service members who are steely during and after combat and those who break. Psychiatrist Deane Aikins, who supervises some of those studies, discourages the idea that heroism is a choice. ""The hard part for many people to understand is that the man even being alive is a miracle,"" he says, referring to Murphy, the cop in Wisconsin. ""It may be that some people have stress hormones that run cooler in dangerous situations."" Look to the good in humankind -- look to heroes, says grieving father . But after studying hundreds of veterans who served in Afghanistan and Iraq, Aikins believes that most tried to run but couldn't. ""Random luck and surviving,"" he says, defines many who survive to be called heroes. Aikins does offer one idea about those who help others and then live to be called heroes: they cultivate social bonds before and after the crisis. Service to the military or to a police department pays little in wages, but it can offer the remuneration of social ease and acceptance. In 2005, the Journal of Personality published a study that examined why some non-Jews helped rescue people from the Nazis and why others did nothing. They found that those who had helped were more likely to report risk-taking behavior -- but the strongest correlation was with those who said they interact with friends and family on a regular basis. Defining a hero is harder than defining a coward -- the latter of whom Ambrose Bierce got right: ""One who, in a perilous emergency, thinks with his legs."" Those who saved people in Colorado and Wisconsin probably acted impulsively, unthinkingly, randomly -- but they did not run for the exits. This story was originally published on Time.com.

"(CNN) -- Ivory Coast has closed its borders with Ghana after a brazen attack against its security forces left eight people dead, the country's defense minister said. The attack occurred Thursday and carried into Friday morning when gunmen launched an assault against two police stations and a military post in the coastal town of Port-Bouet. The border town of Noe also was attacked, said Defense Minister Paul Koffi Koffi. Those responsible then fled to Ghana, though not before five of the gunmen were killed, officials said. Ivory Coast shares a more than 400-mile border with Ghana, where loyalists to former President Laurent Gbagbo have gone into exile. Ghana President John Dramani Mahama vowed earlier this month not to allow his country to serve as ""back base"" to destabilize its neighbor. Last month, three top allies of Gbagbo were arrested in less than a week, raising political tension in the West African country where its army has been hit by weeks of attacks. Ivory Coast's authorities say Gbagbo's supporters are behind the attacks, intended to destabilize the nation, which is still recovering from a post-election crisis in which more than 3,000 people were killed last year. Gbagbo is accused of crimes against humanity after he rejected election results and refused to step down when current President Alassane Ouattara was declared the winner in 2010. The standoff sparked months of violence between supporters of both sides. Journalist Eric Biantuadi contributed to this report .","The attack began Thursday and carried into Friday morning .

"(CNN) -- A very nice married couple from Canada struck up a conversation in a restaurant where we were having dinner. At one point the husband said that, earlier in his life, he had played with some buddies in a rock band. The name of the band, he said, was the Rock-Olas. ""Like the jukebox,"" I said. ""Of course,"" he said. Rock-Ola jukeboxes were gorgeous; they were icons of the early days of rock and roll. ""Where do you think those jukeboxes got their name?"" I asked him. He assumed the same thing most people always assumed: ""Rock-Ola"" was a combination of ""rock and roll"" and ""Victrola,"" the storied brand of early phonograph-record players. ""Nope,"" I said. I had always thought the same thing. But then, years ago, I spoke with the founder of Rock-Ola. His name was David C. Rockola. The whole thing was a total coincidence. Even before he started manufacturing jukeboxes, he had put the hyphen between the two parts of his name when he was selling coin-operated machines. He just wanted customers to be able to pronounce his name -- and the company's -- correctly. The couple to whom I told the story laughed, and later it occurred to me that many products we take for granted -- products so famous that they and their names are synonymous -- once started out nameless. There was the thing -- the product -- and then there was a need to call it something. Take Snickers, the candy bar. When you hear ""Snickers,"" you immediately see the candy, almost taste it. But how did it become Snickers? Well, the Mars family, who introduced the candy bar, had a favorite horse they owned. Snickers. So when they needed to call the candy bar something... Cheerios -- the cereal? It was originally named Cheerioats, because of its main ingredient. But there was a problem -- a competitor was producing an oat cereal with a similar name. Thus: Cheerios. It hasn't done badly. How about Q-tips? Everyone knows what they are, but what does the name mean? A man named Leo Gerstenzang, in the 1920s, saw his wife applying cotton swabs to toothpicks. This gave him the idea to come up with a pre-made cotton swab for use with infants. The product's original name -- intended to connote gentle care of happy newborns (this was in a different American era, with a different lexicon) -- was Baby Gays. But that didn't adequately describe the product, so it was changed to Q-tips. Q for quality; tips for the cotton swab at either end. What about Conway Twitty, the late singer? (I know we're getting a little far afield here -- Twitty was a person, not a product -- but he was terrific, and his name begs the question.) He was Harold Jenkins in the 1950s, trying to make it big in the recording industry, and finding that ""Harold Jenkins"" didn't exactly translate to thrills and excitement. So the story went, he and his manager took a map of the United States and put their fingers on it. On Arkansas and Texas, to be precise. Conway, Arkansas. Twitty, Texas. Soon his records were enormous hits in Rock-Ola jukeboxes from coast to coast. Next up: Weejuns, the classic penny loafers made by the G. H. Bass shoe company. You know those shoes on sight. But the name? It refers to a similar kind of shoe that was worn by Norwegian farmers. Norwegians: Weejuns, for short. You still along for the ride? Let's pull over to the Holiday Inn. One of the most recognizable brands on the planet. When Kemmons Wilson first came up with the idea for standardized, affordable highway motels, he didn't have a name for it. His architect, Eddie Bluestein, as an in-joke, wrote, across the bottom of his diagrams, ""Holiday Inn,"" after the Bing Crosby movie about a country lodge. Some joke. Wilson liked the sound, which turned out to be a spectacular business decision. Haagen-Dazs? A made-up combination of make-believe words to make a brand of ice cream sound Scandinavian and inviting. The words mean nothing at all. Except huge profits. Popsicles, on the other hand, started out as Epsicles, named for their inventor, Frank Epperson. When he applied for a patent, the product was officially titled the Epsicle ice pop. His children, though, called this confection dreamed up by their dad -- their pop -- a Popsicle. Pop's sicle. Taco Bell? In California after World War II, a fellow named Glen Bell decided to sell hamburgers from a stand. He called his store Bell's Burgers. He had some competitors nearby: a couple of brothers with their own stand. Last name McDonald. The brothers had a splendid hamburger product. Bell arrived at the conclusion that, when it came to burgers, he probably could not outcook and outsell McDonald's. So he chose another food specialty: tacos. He tried a few names before settling on a variation of Bell's Burgers, altered to connote Mexican cuisine: Taco Bell. Space is growing short here, and there's probably an outside chance that somewhere in the world today there is more important news than this. Quickly: . Nehi soda pop. The founder wanted customers to understand that his soda pop came in tall bottles, offering good value for the money. Knee-high bottles, to be hyperbolic. In marketing, hyperbolic is good. Thus: Nehi. May we slip just one more in? Dairy Queen. Its founder, John F. McCullough, liked to proudly proclaim to all who would listen that the cow was ""the queen of the dairy business."" As a parting note, let's give the last word to David Rockola himself. He died in 1993; when I spoke with him, six years earlier, he was 90. I told him that it must be really cool to be able to have a jukebox in his home -- especially one with his name on it. No, he said. No jukebox in the Rockola home: . ""I had speakers installed in the ceilings of every room, and I had the wiring put in. But at the last minute, Mrs. Rockola said no. She said, 'You get enough of jukeboxes at the factory. We don't need one here.' "" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene learned the story behind Rock-ola jukeboxes' name; got curious about others .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Two days after Hong Kong's chief executive relented to protesters' demands to drop a controversial Chinese education requirement, pro-democracy legislators Monday got a boost from a majority turnout at the polls. More than 1.8 million people -- or 53% of registered voters -- turned out at the polls Sunday, and pan-democrats won more directly elected seats than the pro-Beijing camp, as well as three of the five so-called super seats. However, pro-Beijing legislators still maintained their dominance at the Legislative Council, thanks to infighting among the pan-democratic factions -- and a system that combines direct and indirect voting via special interest groups. Under Hong Kong's political system, 35 seats are elected directly by the public (""geographic constituencies"") and 35 by groups based on professions (""functional constituencies""), most of which lean pro-Beijing. In a new complex ""one person-two votes"" arrangement, voters can cast ballots not just within their geographic constituency but also for a list of candidates vying in a ""super lawmaker"" functional constituency. With 27 -- or more than a third -- of the 70 seats won Monday, pan-democrats will still wield veto power and can block constitutional changes. The election comes on the heels of a 10-day hunger strike to protest ""Moral and National Education,"" a curriculum that critics likened to ""brainwashing"" with Chinese propaganda. On Saturday, Chief Executive C.Y. Leung said the decision to teach it would be left to schools. While the emotionally charged education issue led to higher turnout at the polls, the pro-Beijing camp benefited from split votes among the pan-democrats, thanks to bitterness within the coalition over 2010 electoral reforms, one political observer said. Read about the curriculum issue that sparked protests . The radical People Power group had called on supporters to cast blank ballots as a form of protest against pan-democratic parties that sided with the government on the reform package, arguing that it stymied Hong Kong's path to a full democracy, according to the South China Morning Post. By noon Monday local time, Albert Ho had resigned as leader of the Democratic Party after a poor showing in the elections, even though he was among the lists of candidates that won ""super lawmaker"" seats. ""Pro-democracy voters went for parties that didn't have that kind of bitterness between them,"" said Michael DeGolyer, a professor of government at Hong Kong Baptist University and director of the Hong Kong Transition Project. Among the beneficiaries in the elections were the Civic Party and the new Labor Party, which represent the interests of labor, unionists and populists committed to social programs, he said. ""I don't think we'll have progress on the pro-democracy front for a while,"" DeGolyer said. He predicted that Leung may find himself trying to build capital with legislators who are more welfare-oriented and with voters fed up with corruption scandals that dogged his predecessor, Donald Tsang. The elections are the fifth since Hong Kong, a former British colony, was handed over to China in 1997 and became a special administrative region under a ""one country, two systems"" model. CNN's Tim Schwarz contributed to this report.","More than a majority of voters turn out at polls .

"(CNN) -- Police are investigating the killing of a 19-year-old University of North Carolina student and are questioning those who last saw her, a police spokesman said Tuesday. The death of Faith Hedgepeth was an ""obvious homicide,"" Chapel Hill police Sgt. Josh Mecimore told CNN, but investigators are still waiting for an official determination of the cause. There are no suspects in custody, he said. Friends found Hedgepeth dead Friday morning at her apartment off campus, police said. She was a member of North Carolina's Haliwa-Saponi Native American tribe, and the UNC American Indian Center, where she was a volunteer, held a candlelight vigil for her Monday night. ""Although the police have not determined the cause of death, they also said they do not believe that this was a random act,"" UNC officials said in a statement on her death. ""Law enforcement officials do not believe that there is danger to other students, faculty or staff."" Hedgepeth's death comes four and a half years after the slaying of UNC student body president Eve Carson, who was killed after being kidnapped and forced to take money out of an automatic teller machine, police said. Two men are serving life in prison in connection with her March 2008 killing. More from CNN Justice: . Suspect in cop's death found . U.S. military identifies dead Guantanamo detainee .

"(CNN) -- This time of the year, even the youngest children know something is up. There's a running stream of political advertisements on television, mail flyers with smiling politicians asking for our vote and the ubiquitous bumper stickers on cars. You can tell when children are getting their daily dose of politics the moment they start parroting back ""I'm Barack Obama/Mitt Romney, and I approve this message."" But making sense of the electoral process can be overwhelming for children. ""One of the problems is civics is not taught adequately in schools. A Democratic system relies on an enlightened citizenry, as Thomas Jefferson said, to meet its goals,"" says Charles Quigley of the Center for Civic Education, a non-profit, non-partisan organization that promotes civic education. Schools used to spend more time teaching children about the political process in class. But national education reform's mandate for high-stakes testing has teachers and school administrators now placing more emphasis on math and language arts at the expense of political science, explains Quigley. The 2010 Civics National Assessment of Educational Progress, also known as the Nation's Report Card, found the civics performance of twelfth-graders has been slipping. Only 64 percent of high school seniors were performing at or above basic level. Achievement by U.S. 4th graders in civics was slightly better, with 77 percent at or above basic levels. Where to start? Quigley says parents can start in kindergarten talking about fairness and justice, why we need positions of authority and rules, what makes a good rule, individual responsibility and rights and the common good. ""Start early and build through the school years, and you will end up with an enlightened citizenry,"" Quigley said. The Center for Civic Education provides lesson plans and discussion topics for parents and teachers. Scholastic, the world's largest publisher and distributor of children's books, offers a political website geared for children with biographical information on the candidates, an election timeline, extensive teaching tools and games for children. Scholastic also has student reporters who provide current coverage of the campaigns, debates and issues. Children have a chance to cast their own ""vote"" in the presidential race on the Scholastic education site. Since 1940 when Scholastic started the tradition, students have successfully picked the winning candidate of the general election all but twice (exceptions: 1948 Dewey vs. Truman and 1960 Nixon vs. Kennedy). ""Every election year we take it seriously to teach readers about the Electoral College, our Founding Fathers and how the system they put in place was so resilient it has lasted more than 200 years,"" says Suzanne McCabe, Scholastic Classroom Magazine's editor-at-large. 2012 elections: Candidate and issue guide . In addition to online resources, students can find valuable information through library books. NY Times Bestselling author and illustrator, Nick Bruel has written a book designed to get young students excited about the presidential race. His book ""Bad Kitty for President"" tracks the story of a cat running for the local Cat Club. It's part chapter book and part picture book. ""I wanted to create a book that would be fun and interesting for kids about this whole process that this country goes through every four years that's bizarre, chaotic and wonderful in how we elect a president,"" says Bruel. Bruel also visits elementary students around the country offering students a civics lesson. Even though it will be years before they can actually vote, Bruel says there is still a role they can play now. ""They can't vote, but they can go up to mom or dad and say, 'Have you registered to vote? 'Cause time is a-wastin!' "" Recommended books: .

"(CNN) -- Ebola survivor Ashoka Mukpo, in his first television interview since returning home from the hospital, told CNN's Don Lemon that he sharply disagrees with Gov. Chris Christie's controversial quarantine policy for health care workers in New Jersey. ""I think that Gov. Christie is playing politics right now. It seems to me that it's an effort to, you know, work with public opinion rather than listen to the advice of the experts,"" Mukpo said. ""And i just think that it's counterproductive."" Chris Christie on Ebola policy: 'We're not moving an inch' A nurse who recently returned from helping Ebola patients in Sierra Leone was quarantined in Newark over the weekend after officials said she had a fever. The nurse, Kaci Hickox, protested the move, saying she was asymptomatic, and she was released Monday after showing no signs of illness. Critics argued the policy of quarantining health care workers for 21 days is unnecessary and could deter volunteers from going to West Africa to combat the outbreak. Chris Christie on possible Ebola lawsuit: 'Whatever' Mukpo, a freelance cameraman who tested positive for Ebola in Liberia and was treated in the United States, said rules like the one in New Jersey treats health care workers ""as though they are a problem as opposed to a public asset."" ""I just think it's a shame and I don't think it's the right way to act, personally,"" he said. Christie, however, has staunchly defended the policy, saying it's only for people who show signs of Ebola and argues the rule is in the public's best interest.","Ashoka Mukpo, who contracted Ebola in Liberia, disagreed with New Jersey's quarantine policy .

"(CNN) -- Ten years after the end of its civil war, Angola, which is heading to the polls Friday, has been transformed into a regional African power with a strong economy, but poverty is still widespread. Angola experienced double digit growth in GDP annually in the period 2002-2008. In the last five of these years, average annual growth was at 17%, which more than doubled the size of the economy. The country is the second largest oil producer in sub-Saharan Africa, and the third biggest economy, after South Africa and Nigeria. Do these tremendous growth rates mean that Angola has escaped the so-called resource curse, where oil resources are detrimental to growth? Is Angola likely to continue growing at these fast rates, and perhaps catch up to the largest economies in the region in a few years' time? Is Angola a success in terms of development and poverty reduction? It is not uncommon for countries that come out of a civil war to grow at very high rates. The growth seen in the period 2002-2008 may thus reflect the end of the civil war in 2002. Read related: Post-war generation emerges as Angola votes . If there is a tendency to blame all that is wrong in Angola on its war legacy, perhaps the end of the war should be credited for things that have been going well? It is always problematic to speculate about future growth rates. After 2009, growth has dropped to around 3% per year and projections for the coming years are in the range 5-8%. There are many reasons for this significant drop, the financial crisis and oil price development are part of the explanation. But in the longer perspective, there may be more fundamental structural challenges to Angolan growth and development. In particular, research shows that resource-rich countries with little political accountability have trouble converting resources into development. Angola scores still low on governance indicators, and the coming elections seem unlikely to challenge the over 30-year-long reign of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos. Watch: Angola's economic potential . The fact the Angolan economy is the most concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa also makes growth vulnerable. The profitability of the oil sector renders diversification difficult in any economy. But is the Angolan government really trying to diversify? An important question is how government reliance on oil rents affects political incentives to diversify the economy. Business environment indicators for the country remain poor, while investment is hampered by a lack of education and institutional challenges. Do the poor care about the overall growth rate of the Angolan economy? Experience shows that growth reduces poverty less in countries with high initial inequality. And oil-driven growth in a country with low political accountability is susceptible to wealth concentration rather than redistribution. Employment in the oil sector is typically also too limited to produce widespread economic opportunities. Read also: Ghana's oil discovery: blessing or curse? We really don't know too much about the situation of the poor in Angola today. The last real census in the country was conducted in 1970. The last figures on poverty are from 2000, putting the proportion of people living on less than $1.25 a day at 54%. Angola ranks as 148 out of 187 countries on the Human Development index. Based on a household sample, INE estimated a poverty rate of 37% in 2008. However, it is difficult to assess how the poverty line was constructed. As data is not directly comparable to previous studies, it is also problematic to analyze development over time. In spite of this, the President claims that the poverty rate has been reduced from 70 to 37% from 2002 to 2008. A census is due to be held next year. Interestingly, but perhaps not surprisingly, it takes place after the coming elections. Some data of a more limited nature do provide a window onto the situation of the poor in Angola. In 2010, the Angolan NGO Development Workshop and the Chr. Michelsen Institute conducted a survey of microcredit clients in Luanda. Results suggest that business profitability among the poor is constrained by a lack of education and health and by corruption. This indicates that the factors that restrain dynamism in non-oil segments of the Angolan economy, also act as constraints on the very survival of the urban poor. Without structural and political reforms of these constraints, it is hard to believe that an election in and of itself will change the lives of the poor. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Arne Wiig and Ivar Kolstad.","Oil-rich Angola is holding its second peacetime elections on Friday .

"(CNN) -- Shortly after 9 a.m. on Friday, a man identified as Jeffrey Johnson shot a former co-worker outside the Empire State Building with a .45-caliber weapon. A courageous civilian saw what happened and alerted two NYPD officers. After the police caught up with Johnson, he pulled his weapon out of a bag and pointed it at the officers who had been performing counterterrorism duties. The officers fired 16 shots, killing Johnson. In the exchange of fire, nine bystanders were injured. As a rule, it takes a lot to get NYPD officers to fire their guns at anyone. Despite a handful of isolated, but highly publicized, exceptions to this rule when officers have shot unarmed individuals over the past decade and a half, New York's 35,000-officer force remains a worldwide model of firearms restraint and veneration for human life. The nation's largest police department instills in its officers that the decision to fire a weapon is momentous and should only be considered after every reasonable alternative has been exhausted. Only when officers feel that a suspect is a clear and imminent danger to them or others can they resort to using their firearms. Then, they must take care to not needlessly endanger innocent people who might be in the way. In rapidly unfolding and completely unpredictable situations, assessing the need to use firearms is often a split-second decision. It can mean the difference between life and death. Officers have to sift through confusion, fear and fragmented information. In the incident outside of the Empire State Building, it is made more difficult because the street is one of the busiest in America. The officers had to take into account the risk of the gunman hurting potentially many people in the vicinity were he not stopped. When New York officers do use firearm, it is a matter of great importance to the department. Shootings are vigorously reviewed. Officers are questioned thoroughly and can be ordered to undergo additional training. They can be disciplined and even terminated. The police department pores over each shooting and tries to glean insights that can help better train cops. The message is clear: Firing a gun must remain the rarest of rare events. For prosecutors and police executives reviewing events when all the facts are known afterward, it is a different story. Officers can be criticized for too much action or for too much restraint when things don't go well. Fortunately, in the incident today, the bystanders who were shot were not seriously hurt. Street officers are always interested in better ways to handle unpredictable situations, and police departments everywhere cannot provide enough quality hands on training for front line cops. Excellent training in firearms restraint is a vital tool that has helped drive down NYPD shootings over time. In 1972, New York's finest were involved in almost 1,000 incidents in which firearms were discharged; in 2010, that number was just 92. Good thing, too, because no matter the training or innate restraint of the police, there really is no safe way to deal with shootings in a crowded city. Ultimately, the outcome is always uncertain. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Eugene O'Donnell.","On Friday morning, a gunman shot a former co-worker outside the Empire State Building .

"Alexandria, Virginia (CNN) -- Sen. Rand Paul said this week that he would vote in favor of going to war with ISIS, but his father, former Rep. Ron Paul, made it clear Friday night that he sharply opposes further U.S. involvement in the Mideast region. Speaking at a libertarian-leaning conference, Ron Paul slammed the ""bipartisan support"" among congressional lawmakers for ""rubber-stamping what President Obama wants"" in the fight against the militant group. More broadly, he suggested that Senate Republicans aren't that different from their Democratic counterparts. Some people think ""if the Republicans take over the Senate this year, that will hamstring the president and everything's going to be OK,"" he said at the Liberty Political Action Conference in Alexandra, Virginia. ""That's a joke."" ""It wouldn't be OK because they all believe in the same thing, they believe in the federal reserve and they believe in the war. They believe in the spending and the intervention overseas,"" he said. Obama's proposed plan includes expanded air strikes against ISIS and arming and training Syrian rebels who are also fighting off the threat. Congress has not voted specifically to authorize air strikes against ISIS, but Rand Paul has said he would vote in favor of doing so. The Kentucky Republican has long been more moderate than his father, a former Texas congressman who ran for president three times and has strong support among the libertarian base. Still, Rand Paul has largely opposed foreign interventions in the past, and his decision to support air strikes has been viewed as more hawkish than his previous stances. The Senate on Thursday passed legislation that would also approve the arming and training of Syrian rebels . But Rand Paul was one of 12 Republicans who voted against the legislation, saying he feared the weapons would end up in the wrong hands. He launched into a lengthy Senate floor speech Thursday against the plan, blasting ""barnacled enablers"" for pushing a policy that he believes would be ineffective. Ron Paul never mentioned his son, who spoke the previous night on the same stage, during his remarks about foreign policy. The former congressman, however, said that the family got together the previous night to have ""strategy meeting."" ""I'm going to reveal some secrets to you,"" Ron Paul told the audience, cheekily hinting that he was going to talk about Rand Paul's likely presidential bid in 2016. But the former congressman jokingly went on to list a number of mundane family matters, such as when's the next golf game and details about a family wedding. ""We did have some very, very serious discussions,"" he went on to say. ""And of course some very important things too about what the family's doing and that is the truth. The issues are very, very important to all of us, and yet the family is pretty important to us too.""","Ron Paul slams ""bipartisan support"" in Washington for war against ISIS .

"(CNN) -- President Obama is about to send up to 300 military advisers to Iraq in an attempt to stabilize a situation that is rapidly disintegrating. Obama had hoped that the end of the Iraq war would be a key accomplishment of his administration. But just as he thought it was safe to get out, the President is finding himself drawn back, as violence has been spreading throughout Iraq. Understanding that American patience for another war is limited, President Obama promises this mission will be contained. But mission creep is difficult to avoid. The history of military involvement shows that many operations that start small end big. While the United States initially entered Korea to try to get the North Koreans out of South Korea after an invasion, President Harry Truman found himself presiding over a full-scale military mobilization that lasted three years, cost over 30,000 lives and helped bring down his administration. Vietnam started small, with military advisers under Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy. Even when President Lyndon Johnson requested from Congress the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution that granted him broad authority to use military force, he didn't imagine how big the conflict would become, resulting in the death of nearly 60,000 U.S. soldiers and dramatically undermining America's role in the world. Examples of mission creep continued. George H.W. Bush had 30,000 troops enter into a peacekeeping mission in Somalia. The mission didn't go so well. As a result of an attack on U.N. forces by a warlord in the country, the operation expanded and President Clinton found himself ordering more expansive operations. Although George H.W. Bush was determined to stick to his goal of kicking Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait in 1990 and 1991, once troops were in the region, the United States became committed to ongoing engagement with Hussein as he flouted U.N. resolutions. In Afghanistan and Iraq after 9/11, the United States vastly broadened the scale and scope of its operations as challenges of post-regime reconstruction proved immense. Why does it prove so difficult to contain operations? Why is mission creep so common? Most importantly, war inherently involves many moving parts, most of which are not under the control of the commander in chief. Often, as was the case with South Vietnam in the 1960s, allies prove difficult to rely on and cause problems of their own, while opponents frequently are capable of causing far more trouble than expected, even when they have fewer resources than the United States. Although a mission might seem small at first, the logic of war creates new dangers for advisers or soldiers in the field and makes it very difficult to avoid pouring more resources into a problem. Domestic politics also matter. Very often the political pressures to escalate intensify once a president has committed forces to a region, particularly in the early years of a conflict. Both parties, as was the case with the Cold War and in the aftermath of 9/11, vie to be the party that will be tougher against the nation's adversary. Neither party wants to look weak, to be the party, as Republicans said of Democrats after 1949, that lost China to communism. Finally, in this day and age, many of the missions that involve U.S. troops are not clear-cut or well defined. It is unclear what victory even looks like anymore. During the war against terrorism, the United States has found itself drawn into operations where it is trying to create stable government structures that will not house terrorist networks or work on a continuous basis in countries to fight against fundamentalist forces. None of this lends itself to a quick end or to limited involvement. President Obama might get lucky and find that the advisers he sent to do the job get the job done. But history shows that mission creep can also happen quite quickly, and the President could easily find himself forced to send more troops than he expected into the quagmire of Iraq.","President Obama plans to send 300 military advisers to Iraq to stabilize conflict .

"(CNN) -- Judy Warzenski didn't realize how bad her father, Donald's, memory had gotten until he turned to her sister Joyce and asked, ""Where's the girl who was sitting next to you?"" He did not recognize Joyce as his own daughter. This Thanksgiving, Warzenski and her younger siblings will eat Thanksgiving dinner with their father in a private dining room at a nursing home in Pennsylvania. Moving her father there in October was an agonizing decision. ""It's really very upsetting to me,"" said Warzenski, 62, of central New Jersey. ""I promised him I would never do this. I promised him I would never put him in a nursing home, which I've come to realize is an unrealistic promise."" Warzenski, who had commented on a previous CNN dementia story, is one of many baby boomers who must watch their loved ones suffer from Alzheimer's, the most common form of dementia. The condition, which robs people of their memory and thinking skills, necessitates tough decisions about caring for people as their minds slowly slip away. ""Often, the baby boomers are thrust into the position of caring for a loved one with dementia because that loved one declines and needs 24-hour supervision,"" said Laura Wayman, a dementia care specialist and author of ""A Loving Approach to Dementia Care."" iReport: Who's at your Thanksgiving table? 'Generation Alzheimer's' The Alzheimer's Association says that unless a treatment or cure is found, Alzheimer's ""will become the defining disease of the Baby Boom Generation"" or, as the association calls it, ""Generation Alzheimer's."" Currently, there is no proven method to fully stop the progression of symptoms or reverse them. Approximately 10 million baby boomers will develop Alzheimer's, according to estimates from the Alzheimer's Association. Of those who reach the age of 85, nearly one in two will get it. Most people with Alzheimer's begin experiencing symptoms after age 60, according to the National Institutes of Health. Only 5% of people with the condition start showing signs of it before age 65; this is called early-onset Alzheimer's. Symptoms can even begin in the 30s, 40s or 50s, and in some cases there is a clear genetic link. Can hormone therapy help protect the brain? Many of the boomers taking care of loved ones with dementia have children of their own, forcing them into a ""sandwich generation"" situation that comes along with a lot of financial strain. Some caregivers are resistant to asking for help, but it's essential that they have a support network, Wayman said. The caregiver's own health, finances, income and employment may suffer. Wayman's own mother died of a heart attack while caring for Wayman's father. ""They feel like they should be able to take care of this person, and they can't do it by themselves,"" she said. More than 15 million Americans are providing unpaid care for a person with dementia, according to the Alzheimer's Association. That care amounts to $210 billion in unpaid hours. And 80% of home care for people with dementia comes from family members. Living with Alzheimer's . Bill Carey, 54, of Ferndale, Michigan, is one of those with early-onset Alzheimer's who is still able to articulate and understand what's happening. He is the third person in his family to receive a diagnosis of Alzheimer's. Carey has known he has the condition for about nine years, as he wrote in the comments on a previous CNN story. A spinal tap confirmed that he has high levels of a protein associated with Alzheimer's. His speech is still coherent, but he had to give up his job as an apartment manager because he was making mistakes: for example, he could no longer handle adding up the amounts on rent checks. ""Even with simple arithmetic, my brain just shuts down,"" he said. ""It's like there's nothing there."" Alzheimer's called 'defining disease' of baby boomers . But Carey isn't sitting by idly. He goes to a local support group with others who are in the early stages of Alzheimer's. They talk about the things that they remember and share coping techniques. He also takes the medications Aricept and Namenda, designed to slow the progression of symptoms, and they appear to be working. To keep his mind challenged, he does jigsaw puzzles on his computer. Carey's domestic partner, Larry Stowell, sorts out his medications, handles Carey's finances and has ""been extremely supportive"" overall, Carey says. The two will spend Thanksgiving alone. Although Carey doesn't cook as much as he used to, he is charge of the turkey. ""I haven't set fire to the house yet,"" Carey said. ""I'm sure Larry will tell me when I reach that point."" Caring for a wife . Others are still in their 50s and further gone. Mike of Massachusetts writes in an e-mail that he is ""Feeling as if I've lost my wife and had her replaced by a child who looks like her."" His wife, Sally, is only 51 and has dementia. The couple is unsure whether it is specifically Alzheimer's, but she may get further testing to find out. ""I feel as if we can't really talk seriously about anything anymore, and I have to make all of the decisions in our lives,"" Mike said. Mike asked that his wife's name be changed and that their last name not be used. He requested to be interviewed over e-mail instead of the phone so that his wife would not overhear and get upset. Their adult daughter lives with them and helps out. Mike is also looking into adult day care and is trying to get friends to take Sally out of the house now and then so he can have some respite. Mike says the two are rarely physically intimate anymore. Mike and Sally are not going to be celebrating Thanksgiving on Thursday. Mike has to work that day, and Sally cannot cook. She can no longer operate a shower, plug in a hair dryer or use a dishwasher, Mike says. Report: Yearly cost of Alzheimer's tops $200 billion . What to do for Thanksgiving . Wayman offers these tips for spending Thanksgiving with a person with dementia: . • While preparing the food, reminisce about past Thanksgivings. But don't ask, ""Do you remember when ..."" something happened, since you don't know how much has been forgotten. Instead, try starting your memories with ""Wasn't it fun when we ..."" • Limit the number of guests at the meal. You might even want to have two different Thanksgiving meals if there are a lot of people who would want to come. People with dementia have trouble processing and tracking information, so if there a lot of people, they may have extra difficulty following a conversation. • Make sure there is a place for the person with dementia to rest if he or she feels overwhelmed. • Fill your home with pleasant, traditional, soothing aromas. Put a couple of teaspoons of vanilla in a baking pan to make the kitchen smell like desserts baking. Cooking the meal may also produce smells that are familiar to your loved one with dementia. • Incorporate the person with dementia in food preparation as appropriate, perhaps by stirring a mixture or setting a table. But safety is the priority: Wayman knows a family whose mother with dementia went to get the turkey from the oven but fell and burned herself. And after . Although Warzenski feels bad about her father having to be in a nursing home, he doesn't say that he needs to go home. Instead he might say, ""I need to get my car,"" she says. Warzenski is grateful that he is safe and won't hurt himself in the middle of the night. He does not appear to be aware that he's in a facility. At this point, she just wants him to be comfortable. ""For him to pass would be a blessing to him,"" Warzenski said. ""He was a police officer. If he ever realized what had become of him, he would be mortified.""

"El Cajon, California (CNN) -- The possibility that the killing of an Iraqi woman who was left brutally beaten in her Southern California home last week was a hate crime is ""just one aspect"" being investigated, a police official said Monday. Shaima Alawadi, a 32-year-old mother of five, died of a severe head injury after she was taken off life support Saturday, El Cajon, California, Police Chief Jim Redman said at a news conference. A note that was ""threatening in nature"" was found near where her 17-year-old daughter discovered her lying unconscious in the dining area of her home in El Cajon in San Diego County last Wednesday, Redman said. Redman would not specify what the note said; the daughter said it told the family to go back to Iraq and called them ""terrorists."" ""Based on the content of the note, we are not ruling out the possibility that this may be a hate crime,"" Redman said. ""Other evidence,"" however, leads investigators to keep open to other possibilities, he said. ""The possibility that this is a hate crime is just one aspect of what we are examining."" Although the investigation is ""still in the early stages"" and police ""have not drawn any conclusions,"" Redman did say evidence leads them to ""strongly believe that this was an isolated incident."" The chief would not describe that evidence. Detectives obtained a search warrant for the family's home because a court order is ""just the best way to recover evidence,"" Redman said. The daughter, Fatima Al Himidi, told CNN affiliate KGTV that a similar note was left outside the family home earlier in the month, but the family did not report it. ""A week ago they left a letter saying, 'This is our country, not yours, you terrorists,'"" she said. ""So my mom ignored that, thinking (it was) kids playing around, pranking. And so the day they hurt her, they left it again and it said the same thing."" Hanif Mohebi, executive director of the San Diego chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said the family came to the United States from Iraq in the mid-1990s. He did not know when they moved to El Cajon, which has one of the nation's largest Iraqi communities. Alawadi and her husband have three daughters and two sons, ranging in age from 8 to 17, Mohebi said. Fatima Al Himidi said nothing was stolen from the house, leading her to believe the attack on her mother was motivated by hate. ""Why did you take my mother away from me? You took my best friend away from me,"" she said, choking with tears, in an interview with CNN affiliate KUSI. ""Why? Why did you do it? I want to know. Answer me that."" Social media users quickly compared Alawadi's death to that of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, calling both hate crimes, and drawing a parallel between a hijab and a hoodie. Martin was killed last month as he walked back to the house of his father's fiancee in Sanford, Florida, after a trip to the convenience store. Police say he was shot by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer who said he was acting in self-defense and has not been charged. The teen was unarmed, carrying a bag of Skittles candy and an iced tea, and was wearing a hoodie. On Sunday morning, the authors of the parenting blog Momstrology tweeted: ""A teen murdered for wearing hooded sweater. An Iraqi woman beaten to death for wearing a head scarf. Our hearts ache for you."" CNN's Samira Said, Maria P. White and Chuck Conder contributed to this report.","NEW: Police chief: ""Other evidence"" leads investigators to keep open to possibilities .

"(CNN) -- When American basketball player Kevin Sheppard moved to Iran in 2009, he was greeted by elaborate graffiti that read ""Down with the USA"" and ""America is the Devil."" Similar rhetoric came from the United States, with the government decrying a nuclear weapons program from the country that was part of the ""Axis of Evil."" It was in this tense political climate that the 6-foot point guard from the Virgin Islands accepted a job with the Iranian Super League after being recruited to carry his team to the playoffs. Filmmaker Till Schauder joined Sheppard on his journey, chronicling the basketball player's experience in one of the most feared countries in the world in a documentary called ""The Iran Job."" Although Sheppard had played basketball in several countries around the globe -- including Israel, Spain, China and Brazil -- he accepted the job in Iran with some reluctance. ""I said to myself, 'Well, if I get there and it's everything like the news said it was, weapons of mass destruction, these people are crazy ... then I'm just going to get on the next plane and come right back home,' "" Sheppard said. Yet, what he encountered upon arrival was the unexpected: a team of dedicated basketball players, devoted fans cheering his name, friends with a sense of humor and families that opened their doors and their homes. ""They love Americans!"" Sheppard exclaimed. ""It was so ironic, because here I was in a country where they have all these signs: 'Down with USA' and 'USA's the Devil' and 'USA's the Evil One.' And then with the people, they're like, 'Man! I love Kobe Bryant! I love LeBron James! I love you guys. I want to be like you. I want to go to America and be a superstar!'"" Understanding Iran: U.S. athlete reveals his inside story . Sheppard became a local star in the cultural center of Shiraz, where he gradually led his low-ranking basketball team to more wins and ultimately to the playoffs. And with nothing more than a than a small HDV camera, a wireless mic and an extension cable packed in an unassuming backpack, Schauder began filming Sheppard's progress ""under the radar."" Without a journalist's visa and running the risk of imprisonment, the German-American filmmaker planned to tell authorities he was a European tourist filming Iran's ancient sites if questioned. Yet despite the rigid measures, Schauder saw the opportunity for intercultural dialogue through the charismatic ball player. Sheppard, along with 12 other American basketball players in the country, came under investigation by the U.S. State Department for technically breaking the trade embargo against Iran by accepting a salary. The investigation reminded Schauder of the lack of diplomatic relations between the two nations and the fact the U.S. hadn't had an embassy in Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. ""It struck me that these players could potentially be bridge-builders,"" Schauder said. As an athlete, Sheppard strove to avoid politics and focus on the game but soon learned that politics is the game for nearly every aspect of Iranian life. The women he befriended could be imprisoned for visiting his apartment; police could stop a car that they suspected carried unmarried women with men; people who spoke out against the government could be detained without explanation. Sheppard found himself literally in the middle of the tense political situation in spring 2009, when Iranians took to the streets to protest the results of the presidential election. It was the beginning of the country's Green Movement, when demonstrators claimed a rigged election and demanded the removal of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Sheppard, in the capital of Tehran for the playoffs with his team, unwittingly found himself in the heart of the protests. ""I was getting ready to go to practice, and they had this street, like this long street as far as your eyes could see,"" Sheppard explained. ""On one side was Hezbollah, which is like their police, their military police, and the other side were the Green protesters. I had to go through the middle of that road, and I was just saying to myself, 'If one of these guys throw a bottle, a stone, shoot a gun, I'm going to be caught between almost a million people.' That's when I said, 'Man, this thing right here ain't no basketball; this thing right here is starting to get serious.' "" Although the protests were quickly quelled by the government, Iran's Green Movement was the prelude to the Arab Spring, laying the groundwork for subsequent uprisings across the Middle East and even the United States' Occupy Wall Street movement. ""It's important to remember that all of these uprisings in the countries that we now associate with the Arab Spring, all of these uprisings were initiated by the Green Movement in Iran,"" Schauder said. ""So it's ironic that Iran, of all places, hasn't quite gotten there yet. ... I really hope at some point in history, we'll remember the Iranian people as the ones who got things going."" Schauder is determined to record that piece of Iranian history, and as the revolutionaries go online to mobilize support, the filmmaker likewise utilizes the Internet to spread their story. Along with his co-producer and wife, Sara Nodjoumi, Schauder launched one of the most successful Kickstarter campaigns in the fundraising site's history, raising $100,466 for the production of ""The Iran Job."" Another campaign is under way to fund distribution of the film. ""When you get so much support from every corner of the world, you literally feel the love,"" Schauder said. ""It's a combination of basketball fans, people interested in bettering relationships between the two religions, between the two cultures, and a lot of people coming together and entering this big tent that we're trying to create."" The ultimate goal of the documentary for Schauder and Sheppard is intercultural dialogue. Both hope that a clearer understanding of the Arab world in the West will lead to more informed policy decisions and will foster support for the ordinary people who are fighting to realize democracy. ""This story here needs to be told because we're grouping Iran with the government and not the people,"" Sheppard said. ""We're not understanding that the people wanted an opportunity to change the government.""","Kevin Sheppard moved to Iran in 2009 to play basketball .

"London (CNN) -- Using your fingerprint to identify yourself seems beguilingly simple: it belongs only to you, and you aren't going to lose it. Apple's use of fingerprint technology -- although not the first in the industry -- seems very in tune with its ethos of making devices easy to use. However, how safe fingerprint technologies really are does depend on how they are implemented. You might ask, is my fingerprint stored, who else can access it? Can the government demand that Apple hand my fingerprints to them, or use Apple to identify criminals from their database? Apple have stated on record that they do not store fingerprints, and nor does the device. Instead, the iPhone stores the result of a check -- a ""hash,"" which may be unique, but can't reveal your fingerprint. But after the revelations by Edward Snowden that Apple was one of four Internet companies to have handed over data to the NSA, Apple has a much harder job to persuade the public to trust them. We need to know that backdoors won't be built into iPhones to allow security services' to retrieve your fingerprint data. The NSA has been shown to have a program of demanding means of entry to the software and hardware of all cell phones, through introducing security flaws. These flaws -- software bugs -- are also available to criminals and competing security agencies to exploit. Are we going to trust Apple's security won't be compromised? They are participants in the PRISM scheme -- whatever precisely that involves. How else are they co-operating with secret NSA demands? The long-term answer to these security trust issues is to reveal the whole of these systems, including the underlying ""source code"" so that computer programmers can check how they work, and ensure that systems are not compromised. That's not really the kind of approach that Apple has been famous for, often being very closed about their software development and asking us to trust them to know best. Citizens and businesses should not have to trust their security to systems they cannot examine. Apple's fingerprint system does create a risk of ""normalizing"" biometrics. Because of the iPhone's widespread use, people may increasingly expect to use similar ""easy"" and ""safe"" biometric systems, without considering that they create highly personal identification, with risks of being tracked and surveilled, and yet do not necessarily deliver the security that they imply. Other low level fingerprint ID systems suffer the same problems, yet are being employed in schools, even to replace library cards. Biometrics can create a false sense of security. It is easy to assume that the tools really are a hard identification of an individual, and therefore, the technology cannot be fooled, or go wrong. However, systems can be fooled. Fingerprints and even your iris can be replicated. Apple's fingerprint system may encounter a simple problem, in that the key to unlocking your phone -- your fingerprint -- could well be liberally scattered across the phone you are trying to protect. While the phone may also look for body heat, or skin irregularities, there is at least a distinct path which could be used to try to break into a phone. We'll have to see if anyone can use it successfully. Some of these risks are manageable, through transparency and audit. The wider social risks are far harder to manage; arguably they aren't Apple's problem. Perhaps society needs to start having a much more intense debate about security and privacy, starting off with asking: whose security are we worrying about: my own, or the state's? How do I know what risks I am taking, and why should I trust any of the claims that are made? People understand what a wallet or a doorlock is. The risks with personal and financial information are less tangible, and the risks of state abuse of power sometimes less tangible still. But these come with the digital technology; we will truly be citizens of the digital age when we can successfully debate and deal with these problems. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jim Killock.","Apple's new iPhone 5S features fingerprint recognition technology .

"New York (CNN) -- The classroom walls tremble as a room full of 8-year-olds bob heads, shrug shoulders and wriggle around in sync with the thud of the bass. An emcee runs up to the front of the room and yells ""hip,"" to which the children respond, ""hop."" And with that, the ""party"" has begun. This is obviously not a typical class. It is more like what one organizer calls, ""a party with a purpose"": a program called Hip Hop Public Health, which uses music as a vehicle to communicate health messages to children. ""Music is an extremely powerful medium,"" said Dr. Olajide Williams, founder of the program. ""Great poets have described music as being the bridge between heaven and Earth, but I see music as the bridge between health education and the streets."" For nearly a decade, Hip Hop Public Health has taken public health messages -- which, let's face it, can sound boring if you're a kid (or an adult, for that matter) -- and transformed them using clever rap lyrics and infectious beats. When Williams -- whose day job is chief of staff in the Department of Neurology at NY-Presbyterian/Columbia Medical Center -- had the idea of fusing hip-hop and public health, his next thought was that he needed serious help. ""I'm really hopeless,"" he said, laughing. ""I'm a neurologist; I'm not a rapper."" Williams needed a partner, someone with hip-hop credibility, which he knew was essential to get through to inner city children. After a relentless pursuit, Williams scored a major coup when legendary rapper Doug E. Fresh (also known as the ""Human Beat Box"") agreed to work with him. Their first project, in 2005, was presented at 10 schools in Harlem, teaching children how to recognize a stroke. The main instrument of the interventions was a video populated by colorful animated characters doing a dance called ""The Stroke."" The song's catchy refrain is, ""If he don't sound right, then he's doing the stroke. Sway when he walks, then he's doing the stroke. Slur when he talks, then he's doing the stroke."" It then urges the children to ""call 911"" if they recognize those symptoms. After several months, the pilot program seemed to be working, according to Williams. Not only were kids excited -- yes, excited -- to learn about stroke, they tended to share the messages they learned with family members at home. In addition, there are several stories of children saving family members in the grips of a brain attack. One child recognized that his grandmother was having a stroke and called 911, saving her life. ""That's the power of children, the potential role that children can play within the public health chain of survival,"" Williams said. ""That (story) has always stayed with me, and that's one of the things that really keeps me going."" With the stroke program, Williams realized he had tripped over a powerful communication model that could work for a whole host of diseases and conditions. So, he deepened his bench, adding rappers like Easy A.D., a former member of the Cold Crush Brothers; Chuck D of Public Enemy; and D.M.C., of Run D.M.C., to his roster. The crew then dug into one the of the most pressing health problems facing minority communities: obesity. The challenges are formidable. Recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data indicate that obesity rates are falling overall, but the rates among Hispanic and African-American children are still troublingly high. Those children also tend to live in areas saturated with fast food chains, with little access to healthy foods. ""Hip Hop H.E.A.L.S.,"" or Healthy Eating and Living in Schools, the program Williams and his rapper colleagues developed, tries to chip away at those issues. ""Everyone remembers their favorite song growing up,"" said Easy A.D., director of programming for Hip Hop Public Health. ""Even if you're 5, 6, 7 years old, you always remember the words, the melody, how it made you feel when you listened to it. ""That's what we're doing with our program,"" he added. ""We take health messages and attach them to good feelings, good memories, and that makes (children) incorporate those messages into their lives."" In one video titled ""Watch Your Calories,"" a cartoon character, voiced by rapper Artie Green, admonishes two children who are about to eat fatty fast food meals to ""stop right there for a second. Before you super-size that No. 5 now, check it. See, there's a whole lot of stuff in that meal you don't need."" A menu appears, showing the sugars, carbohydrates and fats contained in their meals. An embedded message in the video is menu board literacy, providing children whose main option may be fast food with the information they need to make healthier choices. Williams admits that teaching children the importance of cooking meals at home and purchasing healthy groceries would also be effective, but he says that teaching ""caloric literacy"" can also provide a substantive impact. For example, he says, cutting 100 calories a day using better menu board literacy could translate to a few thousand calories over a few weeks. ""These small changes are meaningful, and on a population level, these small changes could have very significant impact,"" he said. Another video developed for the obesity program teaches children how to achieve their anaerobic threshold, a measure of optimal performance while exercising. The video, titled ""Hip Hop FEET,"" uses a set of musical beats as a measuring stick for how effectively a child is exercising. If they breathe before the beats count is up, they are over-exerting themselves. If they don't breathe enough, that means they're not trying hard enough. And if they breathe once at the conclusion of the beats, they've hit their anaerobic threshold. It is a complex concept simplified for young people. ""It's using hip-hop in a positive way, to have real impact,"" Doug E. Fresh said. ""We use beats that make you really wanna move. You're not just gonna sit there; you wanna get up and do something."" As it turns out, the programs for healthier eating and exercise are doing much more than simply making children move. Peer-reviewed studies conducted by Williams and colleagues found that immediately after caloric literacy interventions, children changed their food purchases. ""We found that caloric purchases declined by about 25%,"" Williams said. ""So they were buying more healthy items as a result of the intervention."" The lingering question for this intervention -- and for the Hip Hop Public Health program more generally -- is how to sustain this change. After reaching tens of thousands of children in New York, Hip Hop Public Health got a shout-out -- and a request to collaborate -- from the Partnership for a Healthier America, whose ambassador is first lady Michelle Obama. What evolved from that partnership is an album, releasing Monday, called ""Songs for a Healthier America."" The album moves the songs beyond hip-hop into other genres (some of the artists contributing to the album include Ashanti, Travis Barker and Matisyahu) and will be distributed, along with a curriculum, to schools nationwide. Williams is convinced the model that began in New York, with a neurologist and a few rappers, could make a powerful impact in schools across the country. ""This really teaches us how impressionable kids are and how we have an opportunity to shape their behaviors at a young age,"" he said.","Hip Hop Public Health uses music to communicate health messages to kids .

"(CNN) -- Reeling in bluefish or bass just doesn't excite Elliot Sudal anymore. He prefers wrestling fish with a little more teeth. The 24-year-old tussled with a shark over the weekend and has since become the most famous man from Nantucket outside a limerick. ""I've been a fisherman my whole life,"" Sudal said. ""It's almost like a drug -- I got used to catching bigger and bigger fish."" On Sunday, Sudal and his cousins were catching bluefish and noticed one had lost half its body. ""I get back half a bluefish. It's got the stereotypical shark bite out of it,"" he said. So he threw it back in the water, hoping to lure the predator back. Within a minute, the shark came back to finish its meal. That's when Sudal jumped into the water to grab a wrestling partner. ""That particular shark took about 45 minutes to get in,"" he said. ""It was probably 7 feet long and 200 pounds."" When Sudal finally got the shark onto the beach, he kept it for about a minute and posed for some photos before sending it back into the ocean. ""I always let them go. I'm not trying to hurt the sharks,"" he said. Sudal estimates he's caught more than 100 sharks in the past eight months. But most of those were in Florida, where Sudal would catch and release as many as five sharks a day. Occasionally, he might see his name in a local newspaper there. But when you move to Nantucket and start wrestling sharks on the beach, people take notice. ""I got that really cool picture of it. My boss said you should send that to the newspaper here,"" he said. Since then, he's received about 100 calls and messages from women he's never met. But Sudal has also received a wave of criticism over his captures, including concerns about injuries to the shark. Sudal said he has a degree in environmental science and supports conservation efforts. ""I just played around with this guy,"" he said. ""I love the feeling -- it's like a connection with the animal."" He said he'll continue with his favorite hobby. And if a real-life Sharknado ever struck, Sudal will be ready.","Elliot Sudal, 24, made waves when he wrestled a shark on a Nantucket beach .

"(CNN) -- After learning what was going on across the nation in regulating food and drink, especially the edict by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg banning large sugary drinks, I could clearly see we needed a way to prevent government from placing additional regulation on small business owners in Mississippi. A judge has invalidated Bloomberg's ban on sugary drinks bigger than 16 ounces, which is a good move. But as a state legislator, and a restaurant owner, I wanted to prevent our industry from being regulated out of business. Working with trade organizations, I came up with what's being called the ""anti-Bloomberg"" bill -- Senate Bill 2687. It simply says that the Mississippi legislature retains the authority to make decisions about the regulation of food. This bill has been passed overwhelmingly by both the state House and Senate, and we are expecting Gov. Phil Bryant to sign it. Mississippi governor reviews 'Anti-Bloomberg' bill . It will prevent a hodgepodge of regulations put in force by various municipalities. Imagine owning a restaurant and, all of a sudden, your menu doesn't meet regulations. An owner might have to restructure a menu and have new nutritional analyses conducted, which are very costly. Many men and women have worked long hard hours just to make a living, and adding additional regulations and costs could simply force them out of business. The free market should determine what a business chooses to sell. If the market demands healthier choices, then business owners will meet the need. A regulation banning you from selling a sugary drink larger than 16 ounces will not have any impact on obesity. If people want a bigger size, they can simply buy two or more. Opposing view: Banning large sodas is legal and smart . Cities across the country are restricting consumers' food choices in misguided attempts to battle obesity. The ideas for restrictions are endless: limiting the size of soft drinks, requiring calories to be posted, prohibiting toys in kids' meals, prohibiting fast food restaurants in certain neighborhoods, and more. In Mississippi, from the farm to the grocery, the convenience store to the restaurant, all food is already regulated to ensure safety by divisions of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, the state Department of Health and the state Department of Agriculture and Commerce. The ""anti-Bloomberg"" bill simply assures consumers freedom of choice on what food and what size soft drinks they want to buy, and which restaurants they want to patronize. To be clear, SB 2687 does not restrict debate on food policy as it relates to public health and welfare. By making sure the debate takes place at the state level and not at hundreds of local levels, we can prevent a patchwork of regulations that create an uneven playing field. Consistent and uniform application of food policy will actually benefit the public. It also doesn't change current law for restaurants that operate 20 or more franchises, such as McDonald's, Hardee's and Subway. Those will still be required to provide nutritional information to customers. So what role can local government play? Consider these positive and proactive initiatives: . • Create community gardens to provide fresh fruits and vegetables. • Help create more walking paths and bike trails. • Work with school districts to mandate physical education. • Promote local farmers markets. • Expand or set up weight loss programs through local parks and recreation departments. • Create educational programs using social media to educate young people. Local government can and should play a large role in public health. Strategic initiatives focusing on incentives and promotions will have a positive effect on the community. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tony Smith.","Tony Smith, a Mississippi legislator and restaurant owner, wrote the ""anti-Bloomberg"" bill .

"(CNN) -- Finding superlative examples of Britain's national dish isn't as easy as tracking down great cheese in Paris or sublime sushi in Japan. Serving originally as cheap and filling fodder for the country's burgeoning 19th-century working class, most of the 250 million portions of fish and chips sold today by Britain's 10,000 or so vendors of the dish -- ""chippies"" to locals -- remain unappetizing concoctions of gray-colored fish in soggy batter, accompanied by anemic chips and flaccid little sachets of ketchup. Little wonder that so many first time visitors to the UK wonder what all the fuss is about -- never mind where to find mouthwash strong enough to remove the taste of stale cooking fat from their mouths. That's a shame, because some establishments are great exceptions to the mediocre rule. Many are family-run enterprises that use local produce and provide an experience that marries the aroma of the ocean with the warmth of the hearth inside one delicious paper-wrapped package. Our 10 of the best fish and chip shops in Britain list culminates with the latest winner of a prestigious national award. 10. Chez Fred (Bournemouth) Commitment to quality shows at every stage at this legendary South Coast chippy, from the chunky chips cooked in rapeseed oil to the house-made mushy peas, a traditional fish and chip accompaniment in Britain. The cod and haddock are certified as sustainable by the Marine Stewardship Council. Ethical but supremely tasty, these are PC fish and chips par excellence. We recommend: plaice fillet with large chips and mushy peas. Chez Fred, 10 Seamoor Road, Westbourne, Bournemouth; +44 1202 761023 . 9. The Company Shed (West Mersea, Essex) It's smart to keep an eye on your watch if you make the journey to this ramshackle but welcoming little seafood shack near the ancient Roman town of Colchester; if your timing is off, you risk being stranded when the tide surrounds the miniscule island where the chippy perches. Not that this would be such a bad thing, with the fabulous array of seafood to be consumed at the basic picnic tables here, from native oysters at 80p each to crab-and-lobster rolls, cockles, prawns and locally smoked salmon. Prices are a fraction of what you'd pay in London, and you can bring your own wine. We recommend: the cold seafood platter. The Company Shed, 129 Coast Road, West Mersea, Essex; +44 1206 382 700 . 8. The Big Fish (Stratford-upon-Avon) Owner Marina Angelides continued the fishy theme in her career (she used to sing in a band called The Big Catch) when she opened this restaurant and takeaway. Dispensing with the retro (or just shabby) look many chippies favor, the Big Fish is all sweeping windows and smooth design curves. The menu caters to gluten and wheat-intolerant diners, but less picky piscine fans might set their sights on the Big Fish Combo of cod, whitebait, calamari, scampi, haddock goujons (bread-crumbed mini-fillets), chips, coleslaw and salad. We recommend: wholetail scampi with chips and salad. The Big Fish, Unit 3, Maybird Shopping Park, Stratford upon Avon; +44 1789 204 202 . 7. Rock and Sole Plaice (London) With high prices matched by low quality, the West End of London is something of a fish and chip tourist trap. The venerable Rock and Sole Plaice is a local exception -- this Cypriot-run chippy near Covent Garden Piazza has been serving portions of perfectly flaky battered cod, crunchy chips and mushy peas since 1875. The West End theater posters lining the walls hint at the odd big name thesp who drops in: both Peter O'Toole and Anthony Hopkins eat here when they're in town. We recommend: cod and chips with mushy peas. Rock and Sole Plaice 47 Endell St., London; +44 207 836 3785 . 6. Latimer's Fish Deli (Sunderland) A former fisherman, owner Rob Latimer presides over the unusual combination of fishmonger and chippy on this site. Spanking fresh squid, lobster, crab and langoustines are available alongside the usual fried things. We recommend: the catch of the day. Latimer's Fish Deli, Shell Hill, Whitburn, Sunderland; +44 191 529 2200 . 5. Burton Road Chippy (Lincoln) This prosaically named chippy in genteel Lincoln is almost as much of a local legend as the devilish imps that supposedly escaped from the city's spectacular cathedral in medieval times. The preferred fish here is battered haddock -- cod typically rules in the south of Britain and haddock in the north. Everything is fried to order and almost all the menu items are prepared on the premises from scratch. We recommend: haddock, chips and scraps (bits of batter from the bottom of the fryer). Burton Road Chippy, 169 Burton Road, Lincoln; +44 1522 575 201 . 4. Whetstone Fish Bar (Leicester) Buried deep in the Midlands, far from the coastline, it's the commitment to quality ingredients that makes this chippy run by the parents of UK TV presenter Gok Wan stand out -- fish are delivered daily from the port of Grimsby. The fish cakes are tire-sized, and this is just the place to try a chippy custom peculiar to the region: pouring thick gravy over the chips before consuming with the fish. (It's nicer than it sounds.) We recommend: haddock, chips and gravy. Whetstone Fish Bar (no website), 63 Victoria Road, Whetstone, Leicester; +44 116 286 6866 . 3. Magpie Cafe (Whitby) Queues form long before opening at this handsome sandstone old-timer on the harborfront of this sleepy Yorkshire fishing town. The variety of fish stands out here, with sustainable and rarely seen specimens including gurnard, pollock and hake served alongside cod and haddock classics in an oak-beamed dining rooms upstairs. If the restaurant is full, you can sit on the harbor wall with a takeaway. We recommend: fried pollock, chips and mushy peas. Magpie Cafe, 14 Pier Road, Whitby; +44 1947 602058 . 2. Seniors Fish and Chips (Thornton, Lancashire) In classic fish and chip territory -- a small northwestern town of narrow Victorian terraced streets -- Seniors has been attracting queues around the block from its car park location since 2006. Haddock and cod are supplemented by sea bass and plaice. Servers will bake rather than fry for you if the thought of an entire deep-fried fish is going to break your vow to finally lose some weight this year. We recommend: fish goujons, steak pudding and chips. Seniors Fish and Chips, 91 Fleetwood Road North, Thornton; +44 1253 858585 . 1. The Bay (Stonehaven) And officially the Best Fish and Chip Shop in Britain? For 2013, the winner of this hotly contested competition -- in which everything from customer service to sustainability and hygiene is inspected and marked -- is located in a fishing town on the far northeast coast of Scotland. The Bay's challenging-sounding specialities include deep-fried black pudding -- a compacted tube of congealed pig's blood cooked with oatmeal, suet, bread and potato. From its harborside location, the Bay restaurant also serves haddock straight from the North Sea and mackerel caught by a family member. We recommend: haddock and chips with black pudding on the side. The Bay, Beach Road, Stonehaven; +44 1569 762000 .","10 superb spots to sample a British culinary classic .

"(CNN) -- The imprisoned American man who allegedly confessed to crimes in North Korea is not the same son his mother remembers. ""He's not my usual son, kind of different,"" Myunghee Bae, mother of Kenneth Bae, told CNN's Chris Cuomo on Wednesday. Kenneth Bae, who has been jailed in North Korea for 15 months, told reporters there that he committed a ""serious crime"" in the secretive nation and that he had not experienced abusive treatment by the regime. But any statement made by Bae in captivity would be sanctioned by the North Korean government, whose widespread human rights abuses are known to the world. The country has a long history of exacting false confessions. There was something off, his mother said, when she saw him on television. ""He's not my usual son, kind of different. My heart aches when I saw him,"" she said. In his remarks, Kenneth Bae asked the U.S. government, the media and his family to not make things worse by spreading ""vile rumors"" about North Korea. He also asked his family and other supporters to make more active efforts to secure his freedom. ""We're hoping that we're getting closer to the end,"" Bae's sister, Terri Chung, told CNN. ""I'm glad that he had a platform to speak, but it is also flooded back with a lot of mixed emotions, watching him in that prison uniform."" The family is scared for him, Chung said, and is appealing to anyone who may help Bae's cause. ""We believe that Kenneth is being treated well, as he said, and we hope that North Korean authorities will have mercy and allow Kenneth to come home,"" she said. The U.S. government is doing what it can, Chung said, adding that she thinks that ""things are in the works."" Bae, of Lynwood, Washington, was arrested in November 2012 in Rason, along North Korea's northeastern coast. The devout Christian and father of three operated a China-based company specializing in tours of North Korea, according to his family and freekennow.com, a website that friends set up to promote his release. ""He looks very distressed,"" Bae's mother said. ""He has a strong, strong mind, but, I don't know, after 15 months, he has to maintain the same stable mind all the time. I'm kind of worried about that."" CNN's Judy Kwon and Josh Levs contributed to this report.","Kenneth Bae has been imprisoned in North Korea for 15 months .

"(CNN) -- Presidential debates haven't been around forever. A woman hasn't moderated a presidential debate in 20 years. A German immigrant is to thank for election season's October verbal battles. And Abraham Lincoln might have pioneered debate zingers. Don't believe us? Read on. Fast facts . • Howard K. Smith of CBS News moderated the first modern presidential debate in 1960. • In 1992, Carole Simpson of ABC became the first woman to moderate a debate. She was also the first African-American to do so. • Jim Lehrer of PBS moderated his 11th presidential debate on October 3, 2012. Those and the one vice presidential debate he moderated earns him the nod for the most debates moderated. • The Commission on Presidential Debates, founded in 1987, is a nonprofit organization that produces the presidential and vice presidential debates. It is funded by private donations from foundations and corporations, but is controlled by the Republican and Democratic parties. Gloves off at second presidential debate . The first modern presidential debate . • The first televised debate was in October 1960 when then-Sen. John F. Kennedy and then-Vice President Richard Nixon went head to head in the debate watched by 66.4 million people. Sixty-one percent of voters watched it on television. Those who listened on radio thought the debate was a tie or that Nixon won. But for the 61%, Kennedy's charismatic performance in contrast to Nixon's sallow appearance handed him the debate. Three more debates were televised in the 1960 contest and aired on all three networks: ABC, NBC and CBS. It wasn't until the 1976 election that another general presidential debate was held. • The 1960 debate is also the first presidential debate -- all debates before then were in primaries or in congressional races. In 1940, Republican presidential nominee Wendell Willkie challenged President Franklin D. Roosevelt to a debate but the incumbent dismissed it as a publicity stunt. Willkie later refused a debate challenge by Socialist party candidate Norman Thomas. Where they stand: The candidates and issues . • An attempt by Friedrich Kahn, a University of Maryland student, in 1956 could have displaced the 1960 debate's place in history. Kahn, an enterprising German immigrant, wanted presidential candidates to answer student questions in a debate format. To set it up, he reached out to national media outlets and to the former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt to set up a presidential debate between Dwight D. Eisenhower and Adlai Stevenson. Roosevelt said the debate could energize the student population and threw her clout behind Kahn's initiative. Not wanting to serve as a political platform shortly after its university president used his position as a jumping off point for his gubernatorial run, the school banned political speeches on campus before the debate. The decision forced Kahn to cancel. • Some precursors to the modern presidential debate exist. The earliest of note was between then-Illinois congressmen Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas in 1858, who debated seven times in their run for the state's U.S. Senate seat. Transcript: Second presidential debate . What moments made history? • Homeopathic soup: Lincoln might have pioneered debate zingers. In the 1858 debates, Lincoln famously called a Douglas policy on slavery in the territories, ""as thin as the homeopathic soup that was made by boiling the shadow of a pigeon that had starved to death."" Zing. • ""Are you better off now...?"": President Reagan first posed the question to the American public at the end of a presidential debate in 1980. It was a gamble, but it paid off, his Democratic opponent, President Jimmy Carter, served for one term. Republicans co-opted the phrase at the 2012 Republican National Convention, as they tried to paint President Barack Obama as a Carter-like president. America's voters: CNN Poll of polls . • The sighs have it: In the 2000 election, then-Vice President Al Gore unloaded several heavy sighs while opponent then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush was answering questions. While focus groups thought Gore had performed better, the sigh heard round the world, parodied over and over, enforced the perception of Gore as a know-it-all. Not to blame Gore's heavy breathing, but he later lost the election. Will 2012 debates make history? Yes, TBD and not sure yet. • Yes: This year's debate marks the first time in 20 years that a woman has moderated a presidential debate: CNN's Candy Crowley. Including Crowley, there have been eight female moderators since 1960. Another nugget about women and the debates? Only two female candidates have ever taken part in a general election debate. Both Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 and Sarah Palin in 2008 were candidates for vice president. • TBD: There have been no defining zingers and gaffes thus far, although Joe Biden tried to recycle Lloyd Bentsen's ""You, sir, are no Jack Kennedy,"" delivered to Dan Quayle in the 1988 vice presidential debate. As Paul Ryan was talking about Kennedy cutting taxes, Biden retorted, ""So now you're Jack Kennedy?"" • Not sure yet: Only two debates -- 1960 and 2000 -- were game-changers, a Gallup Survey found. But a CNN poll immediately after President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney's first debate earlier this month showed that 67% of debate watchers said Romney won -- the first time any presidential candidate has topped 60% since the question was first asked in 1984.

"London (CNN) -- Famed for his rugged, immense portraits of the American West, Ansel Adams regularly tops lists of the 20th century's greatest nature photographers. Adams has won countless awards, including the highest U.S. civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In his home country, he is one of the few photographers to have become a household name, following a 50-year career in which he captured some of the most iconic images of American National Parks and the country's immense mountain ranges. Today, he is rarely the subject of the intense, approving attention he once was during his lifetime -- his endlessly reproduced photographs appearing to have lost the ability to enrapture and surprise viewers. An exhibition at the UK's National Maritime Museum in London plans to wash away viewer's apathy. Philippa Simpson, the museum's touring exhibitions manager, aims to re-energize engagement with Adams' photographs by drawing attention to the life imparted into his images by the irrepressible movement of water. The exhibition -- subtitled ""Photography from the Mountains to the Sea"" -- is showing over 100 prints from the artist. ""Adams was a coastal boy and the interest in the sea, and water more generally, permeated his entire career,"" says Simpson. ""By concentrating on that as a theme for the exhibition, we felt it was a challenge in a way to the image of Ansel Adams that has been passed down as a rather conservative photographer -- and we tried to draw out from the archives an alternative history of him as an artist."" As an avid explorer of California's Golden Gate coast, water reappears in all its forms through Adams' body of work. Refocusing the viewer's attention on the running rivers, cloud, snow and ice in the images on display allowed Simpson to combine lesser-known photographs with Adams' most celebrated works, she says. ""For us, what we really wanted to do was give a sense of the trajectory of his career -- how he's come to be known, which is by his photography of the mountains specifically -- and then to say: we're moving on from that."" ""It's a subject that allowed (Adams) to play, which is why you get a huge variety."" Born in a suburb of coastal San Francisco in 1902, Adams was the only child of a family who found wealth in the logging and freight trades and, soon after, lost it in the stock market panic of 1907. Adams experimented with a ""pictorialist"" style in his youth, producing some rarely-displayed photographs where he applied soft focus and hand-manipulated negatives to replicate the style of a landscape painter. But it was his later photographs, featuring meticulous composition and striking pinpoint clarity, for which Adams, who died in 1984, became famous. The art critic Nancy Newhall, a contemporary of Adams, described the ""extreme depth of focus and extreme rendition of textures"" that characterized his photographs. She tells how he was fascinated with the camera as a tool to both stop time at a precise moment and defy the capabilities of the human eye, bringing great spans of distance into sharp focus and creating exaggeratedly high-contrast black and white frames. The Maritime Museum's exhibition explores how Adams' depiction of water changes as he developed from the pictorialism's impressionistic style to forge the crisp modernism for which he is now know. Simpson describes how vast movements of water -- frozen in time by Adams' trademark razor-sharp shooting -- bring life to one of the most well-worn images on display in the exhibition. Adams' ""Clearing Winter Storm"" is a grandiose view of a Yosemite rock face capped by snow, obscured by parting cloud and penetrated by a rushing waterfall. ""It includes water in all its forms and speaks to the ideas of a fleeting moment -- the sort of ephemeral moment. It is a clearing storm, so that suggests a before and after and a sort of narrative within the picture,"" Simpson says. ""It's also a picture which I think looks very muscular and very solid and very geological. It kind of concentrates on these rocky forms, but actually it's animated by a waterfall and by the dusting of snow and ice across the foreground."" While many visitors will continue to greet such images with awe, the criticism -- which the curator hopes to confront -- is also nothing new. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, his human-free landscapes drew scorn for romanticizing a ""wilderness"" that was already colonized by tourism and for cropping out man's influence. During this time, prominent French photojournalist Henri Cartier-Bresson complained: ""The world is going to pieces, and people like Adams ... are photographing rocks!"" In 1952, Adams co-founded 5 Associates, a postcard printing company which today offers lithographic posters, seasonal greetings cards and month-by-month calendars bearing Adams' images -- all of which have contributed to the ubiquity of his work. Simpson hopes a splash of water can flush out some of the best-loved qualities of his work and counter the perception of Adams as a capturer of lifeless landscapes. ""The idea of the shifting landscape is really important: that this was something which is always developing and changing, it's not something which is static and monumental."" The exhibition runs until April 28 2013.","Over 100 prints by the famous U.S. photographer on show at UK's National Maritime Museum .

"Washington (CNN) -- ""I am not a member of any organized political party,"" Will Rogers once joked. ""I am a Democrat."" Plenty has been written on the current fight for the soul of the Republican Party. But as President Barack Obama unofficially rings in the sixth year of his administration with Tuesday's State of the Union address, another intriguing struggle may be emerging -- between moderates and progressives on the Democratic side. It's not a divide on a par with the cavernous pre-New Deal divisions of Rogers' day. Not even close. But it is taking on growing importance as Democrats, frustrated with unyielding Washington gridlock on virtually every major issue, start to look past the current administration. More specifically, as Democrats look toward the future, there's sharp disagreement over whether to stick with a Bill Clinton-style centrist agenda or embrace the unabashed left-wing populism most notably personified by Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio. ""We are seeing a split in the Democratic Party between self-described progressives and the old guard,"" Brown University political scientist Wendy Schiller told CNN. ""If you dig deep, you see that these are old dividing lines based on economics, region, and culture."" Policy ramifications aside, more liberal Democrats worry that a return to Clinton-era centrism will deflate the party's base. More moderate Democrats fear a full embrace of Warren- and de Blasio-style liberalism will herald a return to the party's McGovern-Mondale-Dukakis era political wilderness. Whichever side wins this fight, one thing is already clear: Six years after flocking to the banner of Obama's ""hope and change"" candidacy, a lot of progressives are disappointed in the current Democratic administration. ""It's a mixed legacy,"" said Adam Green, head of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a Washington-based liberal group. ""In some areas, like ending two wars, (Obama's) presidency has represented a return to some sanity. But on the core issue of corporate power and a government that fights for the little guy, this administration so far has had a lot of missed opportunities."" Hillary Clinton's Iowa problem . Among other things, Green criticized Obama for going along with ""watered down Wall Street reform"" and ""a Republican version of health care reform."" Susan Schorin, a 68-year-old political activist from Virginia, told CNN she is particularly disappointed with Obama's willingness to consider changes to Social Security that could lead to a reduction in future benefits. ""I feel betrayed,"" said Schorin, a member of Green's organization and a volunteer for the Obama campaign group Organizing For America. Obama ""was so enthusiastic and identified with saving these programs for people who really need them. He was extremely verbal about it."" Obama's a ""great man,"" Schorin insisted. But he ""turned his back on me and on all of the people that voted for him on that promise."" On the other side, the president and vice president of the centrist think tank Third Way published an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal in December warning that de Blasio- and Warren-style liberalism would be ""disastrous for Democrats."" 5 things about New York's new mayor . ""While New Yorkers think of their city as the center of the universe, the last time its mayor won a race for governor or senator -- let alone president -- was 1869,"" they wrote. And ""what works in midnight-blue Massachusetts ... hasn't sold on a national level since (JFK's election in) 1960."" Warren: End 'Too big to fail' In another dig at Warren, they argued that plans to boost Social Security benefits are ""exhibit A of this populist political and economic fantasy."" One week later, Warren fired off a letter to the heads of six major banks, pushing them to disclose any contributions the banks may have made to think tanks. ""Shareholders have a right to know how corporate resources are spent, and, even more importantly, policymakers and the public should be aware of your contributions and evaluate the work of the think tanks accordingly,"" she wrote. Meanwhile, with Obama's last campaign now well behind him, several left-leaning groups that had previously kept quiet for the sake of the President's re-election are now echoing Green's criticism and bucking the administration on a number of issues. Earlier this month, a coalition of 18 environmental organizations sent the White House a letter warning that Obama's ""all of the above"" energy strategy -- one that embraces so-called ""green energy"" and more domestic extraction of traditional fossil fuels -- is unacceptable for those sounding the alarm about climate change. ""An 'all of the above' strategy is a compromise that future generations can't afford,"" the letter declared. ""It increases environmental injustice while it locks in the extraction of fossil fuels that will inevitably lead to a catastrophic climate future."" Liberal groups made their displeasure clear last year when Obama considered Larry Summers -- a key member of Bill Clinton's economic team -- to head the Federal Reserve. Obama ultimately went with Janet Yellen. A number of progressive leaders also pushed back against Obama's proposed airstrikes in Syria, and made clear their unhappiness with the recent budget deal that froze spending on key liberal domestic priorities. Obama, who originally emerged from the more liberal wing of the Democratic Party, appears sympathetic at least to the economic populism arguments. In a speech in December to the left-leaning Center for American Progress, the President made clear that America's growing wealth disparity would be a focus of his remaining time in office. ""Increasing inequality is most pronounced in our country and it challenges the very essence of who we are as a people,"" he declared. Obama says income gap eroding American dream . While divided Democrats will soon begin their search for a new standard-bearer, political observers warn not to make too much of the differences now bubbling to the surface. ""Both parties have a far greater degree of programmatic consensus than they did 40 or 50 years ago. This is one reason why the parties have polarized and why it is often difficult to achieve bipartisan compromises,"" noted George Washington University political scientist John Sides. ""The differences between Obama, Hillary Clinton, Warren (and others) are mostly at the margins,"" he argued. ""There is far more agreement than disagreement on the fundamental issues."" De Blasio and the Clintons: The ties that bind? ""By their nature, political parties are coalitions of mostly like-minded voters and groups,"" Johns Hopkins University political scientist Adam Sheingate added. ""It's not uncommon for there to be differences on policy issues within the coalition, or a range of opinions on issues that span part of the political spectrum."" Regardless, Schiller argued that the financial demands of modern presidential campaigns may ultimately spell defeat for de Blasio- and Warren-style economic populism. The political war over poverty . ""There is a strong voice within the Democratic Party that believes Barack Obama has not done enough to protect the average working voter,"" she said. ""For now Elizabeth Warren personifies that voice, but when the pressure to raise really big money for 2016 rears its ugly head (and) the Democrats need to be competitive for Wall Street money, her voice may very well get drowned out by the pragmatic wing of the party."" Schiller also noted that around the dawn of the last century, the Republican Party wrestled with a similar split on economic issues. The outcome of that struggle eventually helped fuel decades of dominance for Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal coalition. ""History tells us that danger lurks for both the Democrats and the Republicans if they fail to heal their internal divisions,"" she warned.","Dems disagree over whether to stick with centrist agenda or embrace left-wing populism .
Obama ""so far has had a lot of missed opportunities,"" progressive leader says .

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of young adults are getting a lesson in health insurance from some unusual places: an Affordable Comedy Act show and slam poetry in Chicago, a local DJ in New Orleans and a bar crawl in Austin. With a little more than five weeks left for open enrollment in the state and federal exchanges, health insurance advocates are working hard to enroll millennials. In theory, young people are healthier, and in order to make the law cost-effective, the government needs healthy people to enroll to help pay for the sicker people who will be eligible to buy insurance -- some for the first time, since you can no longer be denied a policy because of pre-existing conditions. ""There's broad agreement that if young and healthy people forgo purchasing coverage for whatever reason while those that are older and costlier choose to sign up, then cost will increase for everyone with insurance. So, it's important to have broad participation in the system,"" said Clare Krusing of America's Health Insurance Plans. Organizations and cities across the country are hosting events aimed not only at enrolling young people in the exchanges, but also getting them involved in education and outreach efforts. They kicked off the campaign with National Youth Enrollment Day on February 15 and will continue to spread the word until the marketplaces close on March 31. So far, only 9% of those who have bought policies are between the ages of 18 and 25. Only 16% of those who have bought policies so far are between the ages of 26 to 34. However, January marked a 3% increase in enrollment among people ages 18 to 34, according to HHS, indicating enrollment growth of 65% for the age group. Of those who have enrolled in the exchanges since October 1, 25% are between 18 and 34, the department says. Terry Burke, vice president of individual business for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, said in the first four months of the marketplace opening they have seen about a third of their membership among 18- to 34-year-olds. However, there has been an uptick in young people buying policies -- and indeed, in every age group -- as the end of open enrollment nears. Two organizations -- Enroll America and Young Invincibles -- are spearheading these efforts, trying to reach millennials through the Get Covered campaign that launched in June. ""We're thinking outside the box in terms of ways to engage people on the topic,"" said Aaron Smith, executive director of Young Invincibles. They are also teaming up with the Columbus College of Art and Design and the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless to reach out to young adult artists and the homeless, who are likely to be uninsured. They go door-to-door and provide educational materials, collect ""commit cards"" from interested consumers and have navigators enroll people in insurance plans. Outreach has expanded to the digital sphere as well through Twitter, memes and mobile apps. To get young adults on board, they have attempted to focus on issues salient to that age group, a primary one being cost. To combat the idea that insurance is too expensive, Enroll America provides a Get Covered calculator that allows consumers to get estimates for how much insurance will cost them. The Department of Health and Human Services reports that of the nearly 3.3 million people who have enrolled since October 1, 82% are eligible to receive financial assistance for their insurance plans. These groups have partnered with community colleges and public libraries, reached out to young parents through Head Start associations, and are doing small business outreach -- especially to restaurant workers. Rachael Klarman, Enroll America's national youth engagement director, said they have worked with restaurant owners and managers to educate employees about new insurance options and to increase access to this highly uninsured group. Another message that has resonated among college students, in particular, is the fact that health insurance must cover things like mental health treatments and preventive care, Klarman said. California's state exchange has aided the ""Get Covered, Tell a Friend"" campaign by working with celebrities -- Kerry Washington, Magic Johnson and Adam Levine to name a few -- to educate their fans through social media. In Chicago, Roosevelt High School's student club BuildOn organized 30 students to host an on-campus event Saturday, partnered with Family Focus - Nuestra Familia. The event hosted 30 navigators to provide one-on-one support and assist community members with the enrollment process. Bryan Quinlan, assistant principal at Roosevelt, said students were really excited about getting involved with the cause. Some eligible students even set up appointments and completed applications. ""They've heard about the Affordable Care Act, but they don't really know what it is. We know that financial literacy is one of the biggest hurdles the act is facing. It's been good because they're learning these financial and healthcare literacy tools and having some fun,"" Quinlan said. According to Enroll America, on Saturday alone, #GetCovered was tweeted almost 6,000 times, potentially reaching as many as 225 million users. This online attention helped direct young people to the more than 125 events they hosted with their 70 partners. Nearly 100 people attended a Miami enrollment fair hosted by HHS, Enroll America and Young Invincibles. On site, 69 people created accounts and 40 successfully completed applications. Several hundred people attended ""Rock Enroll Houston"" -- a Young Invincibles event co-sponsored by Community Health Choice, Planned Parenthood and United Way, among others. The event was live-broadcast and featured food trucks, free Zumba exercises in the park and autograph signings with two Houston Dynamo players. ""The idea was to provide information about health coverage in a fun atmosphere that encouraged young people to come by, stay, and hang out,"" said Erin Hemlin, Young Invincibles' national organizing and programs manager. Even prior to the launch of open enrollment on October 1, youth were identified as a group critical to the success of the health insurance exchanges. The fact that young adults traditionally have not enrolled in health insurance makes this an uphill battle, said Doug Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a center-right policy institute. ""If the reason people aren't insured is ignorance, then outreach efforts will make a difference and the education will be helpful. But if the issues are what it costs and the incomes they have, then you can't change those fundamentals and it won't work,"" Holtz-Eakin said. However, organizers remain optimistic. ""Hopefully we have some positive momentum here that we can build on,"" Smith said.","About five weeks remain for open enrollment in the health exchanges .

"(CNN) -- Although Michelle Obama's primary White House initiative has been conquering childhood obesity, the first lady is focusing on a new area during her first official trip to China: studying abroad. Obama, who landed in China on Wednesday, is there to emphasize the importance of students learning from one another's cultures. She is making a week-long trip to visit children at several schools in three Chinese cities. The first lady took time in Beijing to answer viewer-submitted questions about studying abroad in an exclusive CNN iReport Interview. More than 350 questions were submitted to CNN iReport from students, parents and avid travelers. Several great questions made it into the final video interview, but for the questions that didn't make the cut, here is the transcript of the first lady's responses. The interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. Click on each iReporter's name to watch the original video question. What is your most memorable cultural and travel experience? -- Ovunuchi Ejiohuo, Port Harcourt, Nigeria . Michelle Obama: I'm blessed to have so many phenomenal cultural experiences, everything from traveling to so many parts of Africa to meeting with the Pope at the Vatican to being here at Peking University. Everywhere I go, I'm always struck by the reality that we have so much more in common throughout the world, regardless of where we're born, our race, our religious beliefs. We're all striving for the best for our communities and for our families. This is why study abroad is so important. The more young people get the opportunity to travel the world, live in other cultures and learn new languages, the more they will begin to understand our shared ideals and the shared opportunities to keep moving this world forward. Studying abroad could give you an edge in the job market . How can we, as students, help push our fellow students and the next generation abroad? How can we help you in your efforts to make the United States a more worldly and open-minded nation? -- Ethan Higgins, Prescott, Arizona . Obama: I think so many people in your generation already get it in ways that people in my generation didn't get it. One thing I shared during my speech here in Peking (University) was that when I was in college, I never took advantage of the opportunities to study abroad. Some of it was because I was afraid. Some of it was because I didn't know what opportunities existed. Some of it was because I though the best thing I could do was finish my degree, get out there in the world and make money as fast as I could. But now, more and more young people are coming to college with a broader sensibility. I think that has a lot to do with the fact that people have access to the Internet. You guys are seeing the world through eyes that I never had access to when I was your age. I would just encourage you to continue to be a voice for the importance of travel and stepping outside of your comfort zones to the extent that you're mentoring other young people where you're from, going to schools, encouraging young people to learn new languages and not be afraid to try new things, even if it's as simple as going to another community and trying a different kind of food. We live in the United States of America, where there's almost every culture, every language you can imagine right here on our soil. We can start by experiencing the diversity in our own communities. One good way to do that is through service to the community. But I have the utmost of confidence in your generation. You guys are already making me and my husband very proud. Just keep up the great work. What lasting benefit does study abroad have on students once they return to the United States? -- Jack Burrus, Miami . Obama: The benefits of study abroad are almost endless. First of all, it's going to make you much more marketable here in the United States, because more and more companies are realizing that they need people with experiences around the world, who can speak different languages, who can transition easily into other cultures and people who bring to their jobs a sensibility and a sensitivity for other people. It will also make you more compassionate. We could always use more compassionate, young leaders out there in the world, people who are willing to step outside their comfort zones and be open to wiping away misconceptions. Especially for U.S. students, it's very hard to stay in your comfort zone when you're living in another country. When you're struggling with a language, new foods, learning directions, being forced to make friends and do things that you wouldn't normally do, that's going to set you up for a lifetime of value. It's going to make you a better parent. It's going to make you a better human being. I want more young people like you to take that step. Try something new, travel abroad, and if you can't travel abroad, use the Internet to see the world. How can we make foreign exchange opportunities available for all students and not just the affluent? -- Cate Thompson, Anderson, North Carolina . Obama: Great question, and thanks for your work teaching our kids. Keep it up. Making sure that all of our kids in the United States have access to opportunities to study abroad, regardless of their race or socioeconomic background, is going to be critical for us. One of the things that the President has done by promoting 100,000 Strong is work in partnership with institutions in the United States and abroad, and with U.S. companies, to increase the opportunities for more young people to study abroad, regardless of where they're from. One of the things that he and I talk about is the shared connection that we gain when we have educational exchange opportunities between countries that are enhanced by ensuring that the folks who represent the United States, represent all of the United States. Kids like me, who grew up in a working-class background, grew up in a tiny apartment and went to public schools, there's a perspective that I uniquely have to share with the rest of the world. And the same is true for a kid growing up in a rural China or a kid who is a studying in Kenya. They need to have opportunities to travel the world because they are going to be our future leaders, and their voices are one that we have to hear as we continue to develop this world and continue to tackle the challenges that we will inevitably face. Diversity is key, and we will continue to do all that we can here in this administration to continue to lift up opportunities and make them accessible for all of our young people. How do we get parents to be comfortable with the idea of their children studying abroad and supporting them in this endeavor? -- Letitia Wright of Rancho Cucamonga, California . Obama: Getting parents on board when it comes to studying abroad is key. We all as parents want the best for our kids, but sometimes it's a little hard to let them out of the nest. One of the things that we really need to do is to provide more information for parents so they have an understanding why study abroad is important, how it's going to expand the opportunities for their loved ones and how are they going to be able to afford it. Oftentimes that is a key deterrent for many families who don't have the resources they need to understand what the economic impact will be on their families and on their kids. They also need to understand more about an ever-globalizing economy and that traveling abroad is no longer just a nice thing to do; it's becoming more and more a central part of a student's educational experience. We need people like you, who have had the experience, to be spokespeople, talk about it in your churches and your communities, and the more people hear about these opportunities, the more parents will become comfortable with letting their kids go.","Michelle Obama launches new focus on studying abroad during China trip .

"Harlem, New York (CNN) -- Every four years during the Winter Olympics, millions of people become armchair experts on figure skating: quadruple jumps and combination spins, death spirals and triple Salchows. And like clockwork, many rinks across the United States see a surge in enrollment for figure skating lessons inspired by Olympic fever. But the costs of seriously pursuing the sport put it out of reach for many families. Skates alone often cost $300, to say nothing of the ice time, coaching and costumes. Yet each week in Harlem, Sharon Cohen helps more than 170 girls hit the ice and skate their way to new heights. ""The girls really fall in love with gliding, like I did, and realize that they're doing something very special,"" said Cohen, a former competitive skater who began teaching girls to skate in 1990. ""Before, there weren't a lot of girls (here) that could imagine themselves as figure skaters. ... But the thing about skating is it lets you imagine you can be anything."" Since 1997, Cohen's nonprofit, Figure Skating in Harlem, has provided skating equipment and instruction, tutoring and life skills classes to more than 700 girls from low-income communities. Lessons for life . Each week, the girls participate in two 90-minute group skating classes organized by age and skill level. They have fun, get fit and stay safe after school, and Cohen believes the lessons they're learning can last a lifetime. ""They gain discipline, perseverance. They fall down, and they get back up,"" said Cohen, 48 ""And they learn they can do that in anything."" To hit the ice, students must attend tutoring sessions three times a week. Participants are required to maintain a B+ average; those struggling to do that receive extra help with their studies. The organization says more than one-third of the girls earn straight As. ""We really make them understand that we want (them) to be smart and wise and intelligent young women. And the fact that you skate is the bonus,"" Cohen said. ""We're creating a culture of success."" Success beyond skating . All of the students who've stayed with the program have graduated high school. In contrast, the average graduation rate in Harlem is 61%. Since 2007, all of the program's graduates have continued on to college. ""We want girls to believe and know they can be anything they want to be if they put their hearts and minds to it,"" Cohen said. Kolby Couch joined the group as a first-grader eight years ago. She dreams of becoming an astronomer, but she hit a bump last year when she failed algebra. ""Miss Sharon hired a special tutor for me,"" said Couch, 14. ""Now I'm doing way better in school. ... She is teaching us to be the best we can be in life."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2014 CNN Heroes . Students pay $350 a year to participate in Cohen's program. But with up to 100 girls on the waiting list, Cohen says this helps ensure that the girls are committed to it. One-third of the students get scholarship assistance, and Cohen says that no one is ever turned away because she cannot pay. Breaking barriers . The group recently began competing in team synchronized skating competitions throughout the Northeast. ""They're up against teams (where) girls skate every day and have private lessons,"" Cohen said. ""So the fact that they're even in contention is an amazing achievement."" It's hard work -- because of limited ice time, the group's senior team practices at 6 a.m. on Sundays -- but training as a team gives the girls valuable experience. And their presence in competitions adds a dose of diversity to the sport. ""They're the only all-minority -- Latino, African-American -- team out there,"" Cohen said. ""They're very proud, and they're very well-received."" Cohen hopes to one day build an ice skating education center in Harlem so that more girls can participate. She's also working to bring her program to underserved communities in Chicago, Detroit and Los Angeles. ""When kids are given a blank sheet of ice, they can grow and achieve their personal best,"" Cohen said. ""That's what this is about -- giving them the opportunity to find out what they're made of.""

"(CNN) -- In the face of an army of cartoon characters, some Japanese officials are concerned the public is facing a cuteness overload. Mascots, known locally as yuru-kyara (""loose"" or ""relaxed"" characters), are ubiquitous in Japan, and are used to promote everything from soap, food and train lines, to regions of Japan and even prisons. They come in every conceivable shape and size, including some downright bizarre creations, and are often conceived of and designed by amateurs, a fact that is often all too apparent. But despite the oftentimes amateur nature of some of these beloved characters, it's safe to say that Japan is truly enamored -- or obsessed, to quote one editorial -- with these guys. Noriko Nakano of the Japan Local Character Association told CNN by email that the Japanese have a long-lasting, deep emotional bond to ""non-human"" characters, with roots buried deep in an ancient polytheism. With these noble antecedents, a generation of cute characters, with names like Hikonyan and Barysan were born. And these characters turned out to be perfect for promoting local regions. ""In an era when local governments are in need, (many have) considered a strategy of including emotional warmth and therefore creating 'local characters',"" Nakano said. ""I had noticed that, for selling local products, it isn't possible to increase the name recognition (if) there is no 'face' to the municipality."" Bona fide celebrity . Hence the rise of the regional character, some of whose fame has spread far beyond their territorial boundaries. You don't, for example, need to go to Kumamoto Prefecture to bump into Kumamon. The Japanese region's mascot is a bona fide celebrity throughout the country, and appears on everything from promotional posters advertising his home prefecture and household goods like chopstick holders, to a 100 million-yen ($982,000) gold figurine, made by a Tokyo goldsmith. Kumamon is the current undisputed king of the mascots, as his YouTube offerings make clear. He's also the most visual symbol of the character wars that Japan's prefectures -- akin to states -- are involved in. Osaka is no exception. Perhaps surprisingly for the city that was the gritty inspiration for ""Blade Runner,"" Japan's second city is as cute-obsessed as the rest of the country, if not more so, with some 45 Osaka-themed mascots plying their trade in the city. But this town might not be big enough for all of them. According to the Osaka's local government, some of the city's cartoon representatives may be stepping out of the limelight, sidelined in favor of the chosen one, the city's Moppi, as Osaka's ""core mascot."" ""The prefecture has too many mascots,"" the Asahi Shimbun quoted Osaka Governor Ichiro Matsui as saying. ""People do not know what they are promoting or what policy they are trying to raise awareness of."" Used sparingly . Overkill and dilution of brand identity has meant that other stalwarts of the city, such as the kushiyaki-inspired Kushitan, designed to resemble a deep-fried Osaka delicacy, may soon be surplus to requirements. While the plan is not to kill the characters off -- such barbarism is clearly beyond the pale -- they will from now be used only sparingly, if at all. Instead, the focus is being put on the narrow, bird-like shoulders of Moppi, who designed in the 1990s to resemble one of the prefecture's native avian species. There are plans to work on the Moppi brand, perhaps pairing him up with a Mrs. Moppi, and even having the lovebirds produce offspring. These characters, officials say, can help promote women's and childrens' issues. Not everybody is in favor of the cull, including the prefecture's vice governor, who said ""respective departments devoted their energy to creating their mascots, and each mascot has been loved by department officials... I hope such situations will be taken into consideration."" However, while there are dissenting voices, the benefits of honing one's yuru-kyara image to one or two distinctive faces makes sense, especially in modern Japan's crowded mascot marketplace.","Japanese prefectures rely heavily on their mascots for promotion .
An easily recognizable ""yuru-kyara"" can be invaluable .

Aaron Sorkin has confirmed to Bloomberg that the ""Dark Knight"" actor has been cast in an upcoming biopic about the Apple co-founder. Sorkin, who wrote the screenplay for the acclaimed film ""The Social Network,"" about the founding of Facebook, is at the helm of the picture and said of Bale's casting, ""What we needed was the best actor."" ""He really is a phenomenal actor,"" Sorkin said. ""He didn't have to audition."" Bale will be in every scene, Sorkin said, and it's an ""extremely difficult part."" ""He's going to crush it,"" Sorkin assured. The film is reportedly based on the ""Steve Jobs"" biography by Walter Isaacson, which the late Jobs sanctioned.

"(CNN) -- Anti-Semitism, arguably the most enduring and murderous ethnic prejudice in human history, has always adapted to the prevailing social, political and technological conditions. In our global age of international flows and world politics and communication, anti-Semitism has become global, and it is in no small measure due to digital technologies: the Internet and satellite television. Anti-Semitism now reaches vast parts of the world where there are no Jews. And the people who rely most on the Internet, the young, are the most innocent and susceptible to believing the prejudices they come across. Digital technology has become a game changer for anti-Semitism, and for prejudices and hatreds in general, including against African-Americans. Never before has prejudice toward Jews been so widely present around the world in places where the hated people are present and especially where they don't even live, as a Pew Global Attitudes Survey of 24 countries reveals. Jews form .2% of the world's population, with the vast majority in just two countries, Israel and the United States. Yet in Europe, where Germans and many other Europeans slaughtered 6 million Jews in the Holocaust, a shocking amount of anti-Semitism still exists. Across the Arab world there is almost uniformly poisonous anti-Semitism, including instances of Arab leaders, imams, and ordinary people saying that Jews are the children of apes and pigs. More amazing is that in Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Asia, anti-Semitism is widespread. Fifty percent of Brazilians, 43% of Nigerians, and 55% of Chinese surveyed by Pew said they had an unfavorable opinion of Jews, even though in Brazil Jews form .05% of the population, and in the other countries there are barely any Jews at all. Even in the United States, where anti-Semitism is lowest among major countries, according to the Anti-Defamation League's index of anti-Semitism, ""15 percent of Americans fall in the most anti-Semitic cohort."" Digital technology has critically contributed to the explosion of anti-Semitism in five ways: . While before a person had to be personally exposed, through people or perhaps a book, to vile characterizations of Jews, today anti-Semitism is prominently available everywhere anytime -- to those seeking it out or to the innocent person just looking for information. Typing ""Jew"" into Google or Bing returns a top site (sometimes No. 2) called JewWatch, which is a vast emporium of anti-Semitic accusations and hatred claiming 1.5 billion pages in support of its mission to defame and eliminate Jews and their supposed power. This is but one of tens of thousands of anti-Semitic hate sites, which include a growing alternative to Wikipedia, called Metapedia, which seeks to create (currently in 18 languages) an anti-Semitic informational universe. Second, while before new anti-Semitic accusations and initiatives traveled slowly if at all, today they can spread like wildfire over entire regions or the world, picked up by news or community websites coursing through the Internet and beamed to viewers on national, regional, or international television networks. This can be true of blood libels such as that Jews harvest Palestinian organs, of alleged plots to conquer and colonize Patagonia, or--more routinely--false accusations of Israeli atrocities. It is true of the frequent speeches by political and religious leaders urging the annihilation of Jews. Third, you now have for the first time international and virtual communities of anti-Semitic hatred. Through digital technology, anti-Semites find validation from and communion with anti-Semites elsewhere in their own countries and around the world. Everything we know about prejudice shows that when it is shared in communities, and especially when political or religious leaders openly express hatred of a group, such bigotry is powerfully sustained and spread. Fourth, the Internet and digital technology has integrated different streams of anti-Semitism into a global anti-Semitic amalgam. Muslim anti-Semites adopt anti-Semitic Christian motifs (to win Christians to their cause), regularly depicting in speeches and political cartoons the Palestinians as the modern crucified Christ! Leftist anti-Semites, neo-Nazi anti-Semites, old fashioned Christian anti-Semites, and, of course Arab and Islamic anti-Semites share common cause in their demonization of Israel. Fifth, digital technology has also lifted all anti-Semitic restraints. With the anonymity of the Internet, and with the total lack of anti-Semitic inhibition coming from the Arab and Islamic worlds -- its commonplace demonizing and dehumanization characterizations of Jews and calls for the extermination of Jews around the world -- what anti-Semites say and see as thinkable action goes well beyond, in ferocity and murderousness, even Nazi Germany's profoundly anti-Semitic discourse. Not just the Jews of Israel but Jews everywhere are endangered. Digital technology has transformed anti-Semitism into an essential part of the substructure of prejudice around the entire world. To become inundated with it, all you have to do is, innocently or not, enter the word ""Jew"" into your browser, and then start clicking. But this surge in anti-Semitism also shows the way to combating it, by using legal means and political pressure to get Internet providers, social media sites and search engines to adhere to their own terms of usage, and to the laws of democratic countries -- especially forceful in Europe -- which prohibit hate speech. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Daniel Jonah Goldhagen.","Daniel Goldhagen: Internet, other technology contributing to new spread of anti-Semitism .
He says many sites promote hatred of Jews, reaching nations with very few Jewish citizens .
He says Pew study shows rise in anti-Jewish attitudes in Asia, Europe, Latin America, Africa .
Goldhagen: Internet providers, social media, search engines must cut off hate speech ."
"(CNN) -- When Melissa Seligman's husband left on his second deployment to Iraq in 2005, their 2-year-old daughter began banging her head on the floor. The Army wife tried to rock the girl, sing to her. With a newborn to care for, too, sometimes all Melissa could do was quickly slide her hand between the toddler's head and the floor. Exhausted and desperate, Melissa rushed to the store, wailing children in tow. She found a GI Joe doll with black hair like her husband's and placed it in her daughter's hands. ""Daddy,"" the girl said. She stopped crying and stopped hurting herself. Looking back, the 36-year-old mother remembers how some people, including other military spouses, dismissed her daughter's behavior as typical tantrums. ""But I knew something was wrong with her,"" Seligman said. ""I knew this child felt deeply the loss of her dad."" For years, military parents facing a deployment have said the same refrain: ""My child is so young, they won't remember."" But very young children -- even babies -- can suffer psychological stress, developmental problems and cognitive damage when a parent goes to war, according to recent research by the Boston University School of Social Work. For military youths in general, researchers have also found they are more likely than their civilian peers to have trouble in school and experience higher levels of anxiety and depression. ""What we're seeing over the last decade is an increase in kids being seen for behavioral health visits. We know there has been an increase,"" said Barbara Van Dahlen, a child psychologist. In 2005, she founded Give an Hour, a national nonprofit network of nearly 7,000 mental health providers who volunteer their services to warriors and their families. ""This is not shocking to those of us who work in this space,"" she said. ""This is what you expect when you've got stress beyond what kids can successfully manage."" A generation raised by war . The Seligman children are among the more than 2 million who have been separated from their service member parents, both fathers and mothers, because of combat deployments, according to ""The Future of Children,"" an academic series co-authored by psychiatrist and retired Army Col. Stephen Cozza, a researcher with the Center for the Study of Traumatic Stress. America is raising a uniquely stressed-out generation of military children, other researchers say. Those who were 5 when the September 11 terror attacks happened are now 17; war is all they've known. While military children have always faced challenges and demonstrated resiliency, these children have parents who've been deployed multiple times. Military spouses told me story after story about not just one or two birthdays missed, but about struggling to comfort children whose entire lives were lived essentially without one parent. How Iraq and Afghanistan service members and their partners parent is being studied by Ellen DeVoe, a clinical social worker at Boston University School of Social Work. She's found that male service members tend to minimize their importance to their young children, and their female partners feel left out. The children tend to mirror the way their parents handle deployments. ""My husband has probably been gone for 80% of their lives,"" Seligman said of their children when I visited the family in November at their home in South Carolina. Their daughter, now 10, and son, 8, laughed and played while clutching that same GI Joe doll and a pillow with a picture of their dad, Army Capt. David Seligman. The family stood out from other military families I met because they had, early on, connected with military-referred therapists. The children regularly saw their ""feelings doctor,"" as did their mother and father. A spouse teetering on the edge . David Seligman, a decorated service member who's done three deployments, was home when I visited but had to leave after our interview. He wasn't going to war this time, but to Georgia to take an eight-month career advancement course. That meant that he'd only get to come home once a month at most. It was difficult explaining to his children that Daddy was going to a classroom like they did and wouldn't be in danger. He encouraged the kids to ask questions. They wanted to know if he was going to wear a helmet when he did homework. This is how the Seligman household works -- every time the 36-year-old soldier leaves, the couple tries to keep communication strong and constant. He sends them letters with drawings. They color them in and mail them back. They send him the beginning of a story, and he fills in a part; they continue the plot. The family gave up Skyping when he was in Iraq in 2009. ""It was almost cruel to them to be like, 'Look, there's Daddy, you can see him, but you can't touch him or smell him,' "" David Seligman told me. Seligman served in the Army Reserve from 1996 to 2000. He was in college, and Melissa had just finished graduate school when the 9/11 terror attacks happened. He was gripped him with an overwhelming urge to serve again. After discussing it with Melissa, he joined. The two married in June 2002. He left for Afghanistan in 2004 on a four-month deployment. His daughter was then 6 weeks old. ""She won't remember anything, I thought; so what, Melissa will be there to handle things,"" he recalled. ""I didn't feel like it was long enough for anybody to feel anything."" But Melissa wasn't handling it well. She was suffering from what she now recognizes was post-partum depression. But she was afraid to say anything. She recalled the mantra she repeated in her head. I have to do this perfectly. I need to be good at this, because if I'm not good at this, I'm failing him. In the brief time that her husband came home -- before he deployed to Iraq in 2005 -- Melissa got pregnant again. While he was gone, her daughter's crying and banging of her head and the demands of a newborn consumed Melissa. An aspiring writer, she started to tell her story on a blog and on paper, an outpouring that turned into a memoir, ""The Day After He Left for Iraq."" For a while, the writing worked to calm her. He came home and life went on. But when he was ordered to deploy a third time in 2009, she had a panic attack. Because she'd never treated her depression, she was terrified of how she would react to being a single parent again. She called Military OneSource, the armed services 24/7 nonemergency hotline. She connected with a thoughtful operator who reminded her that she'd been through a lot, and to breathe. Recalling that time, Melissa wept thinking about what might have happened had she not made the call. ""Thankfully I didn't hurt her ..."" she said about her daughter. ""And I didn't hurt myself."" A father at home, but not really there . David Seligman reflects on his choices, too. He is constantly torn between his love for his family and his love of the Army. With each deployment, his children acted differently toward him. When he asked where his son's Thomas the Train was, the boy gave him a look and walked past him to play with toys David had never seen. During his third deployment, his daughter started drawing pictures of crying animals. ""After I came back from my second deployment, my daughter, she was very emotional,"" he said. ""I didn't understand what any of that was about. David Seligman's last deployment ended in 2010, and he came home. And yet, he's not really been home, Melissa said. For the past three years, David Seligman has been a commander of a drill sergeant rotation at Fort Jackson in South Carolina. He would leave for work at 3 in the morning and, most of the time, if he was at home when they were, he was in bed. As a consequence, the children were never really sure if he was home or gone. ""There's a misconception that when you come home from deployment, you're home,"" Melissa said. That might be true for some people, but not the job her husband had. That explains why, as David told me, when he is home and goes outside, to take the trash out or something, the children will panic if they call for him and he doesn't answer immediately. ""They'll say 'Mommy, Mommy!' "" he said. ""They get terrified that we're leaving them."" All he can do is try to reassure them, not just with words but actions. Some service members fear that seeking mental health care will adversely affect their careers. But Seligman said he's been unafraid to talk openly with Army counselors. He didn't do it sooner, he said, not because he had concerns about his career but because of the pace of the wars. He didn't have time to stop and breathe, to figure out he needed to talk to someone. ""It was just, like, I gotta do this, that, go here, come back, do this, come here, go back,"" he said. ""Once I was not feeling anticipation for a deployment, then I was not afraid."" His daughter runs up to him a few times as we talk, and smiles and presses into him. She lingers and watches him as we film, her GI Joe tight in her hand.","More than 2 million children have been separated from a parent in the Iraq, Afghanistan wars .

"(CNN) -- Fans of fantasy franchises like ""Game of Thrones"" are famously devoted -- some might say fanatical. Whether making an appointment with their television, staking out a bookstore, or lining up hours before a movie release, people who love diving into worlds of wonder go to great lengths get the goods. But it may not be ""Game of Thrones"" that has the most rabid fans. ""The Elder Scrolls,"" and its newest release, ""The Elder Scrolls Online,"" boasts one of the most dedicated fan bases in all of entertainment. Celebrating 20 years of adventures on the continent of Tamriel, the six releases in ""The Elder Scrolls"" series have given millions of players the opportunity to explore, create, and battle their way to glory. Pete Hines, vice president of public relations and marketing for Bethesda Softworks, told CNN it is that willingness to give the player freedom that endears the game to its fans. ""You get to make your own story versus everybody else presenting you something where you are playing their story,"" Hines said. ""I think that has continued to resonate with folks as gaming has gotten more popular."" Those ""folks"" add up. There were more than 20 million copies sold for just one game in the franchise -- ""The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim."" Compare that to one of the most talked about fantasy book franchises, ""Game of Thrones."" Random House's Bantam Books said it has sold more than 24 million copies of all five books in the series ... combined. If sales don't impress you, how about sheer size? Tamriel is roughly 7.54 million square miles of land for players to explore, while Westeros (home to much of ""Game of Thrones"") is thought to be about 800,000 square miles and J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth is 3 million square miles. Wiki pages created by fans to showcase elements of ""The Elder Scrolls"" also dwarf the number of similar pages created for other fantasy stories. There are nearly 22,000 pages created for ""The Elder Scrolls"" -- more than ""Lord of the Rings"" (4,944), ""Twilight"" (984), and the Harry Potter books (11,511) combined. When Bethesda asked for people to sign up to beta test their new multiplayer game, ""The Elder Scrolls Online,"" 5 million people (the equivalent of the population of Norway) responded to the call. Hines said there were even attempts at bribery to get in, with one person offering their newborn child and their left arm. ""We determined that was a bit too high a price to pay for a beta key,"" Hines said with a laugh. ""We have very loyal, enthusiastic, rabid fans that are really into what we are doing and want to be a part of it."" While body parts and trading children may be a bit extreme, Hines said there was another family who were so dedicated and loved the franchise so much that they made a life-long commitment after the release of ""The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim."" ""I made an off-hand joke that if anybody names their kid Dovahkin (the title given to the main character in the game) you will get free Bethesda games for life,"" Hines said. ""And then somebody actually did."" Dovahkin Tom Kellermeyer was born on November 11, 2011. Sure, other babies have been named for fantasy characters. People have also held weddings in the style of their favorite fantasy land (although a wedding in the style of ""Game of Thrones"" might be problematic). But how many people can actually say they got married in Middle Earth or Hogwarts? Hines said one couple has approached Bethesda with the request to get married inside ""The Elder Scrolls Online"" game. ""They are actually getting married, but they want to do the ceremony in 'The Elder Scrolls Online.' We're still figuring out how exactly that works and what the ramifications are,"" he said. And of course, the players want to talk about the game as well. ""The Elder Scrolls"" lead the way in that category as well. The series has more than 300,000 subscribers to Subreddit accounts across its various games. ""Game of Thrones"" has 298,196 and Harry Potter has 142,389. And that doesn't even take into account all the fan fiction pages spread out across the Internet. ""It's just all over the place everywhere else,"" Hines said. ""There are blogs and forums and all kinds of places where people are writing their own story, their own fiction."" Lest you think Hines to be a braggart, he did admit he has a great fondness for the ""Game of Thrones"" books and television series. He said many fans of ""The Elder Scrolls"" also follow the adventures in Westeros and Middle Earth. ""There are Harry Potter fans who are Elder Scrolls fans. There are Elder Scrolls fans who are Harry Potter or 'Game of Thrones' fans,"" Hines said. ""It never has to be an either-or.""","""Elder Scrolls,"" the fantasy gaming series, rivals books, movies in popularity .
One game sold nearly as many copies as all five novels ""Game of Thrones"" comes from .
Fans have named children, planned a wedding based on the game .

"(CNN) -- They were young men in their early 20s, all of them joining the armed forces with a desire from an early age to serve their country. They were taken in the battlefield this week, not by enemy combatants but by their comrades in a tragic case of 'friendly fire.' The U.S. military has not officially released the name of the five American service members who were killed Monday in southern Afghanistan when a coalition jet, called in to help ward off a Taliban attack, mistakenly bombed them. According to NATO, the troops were conducting a security operation. Such operations have been stepped up ahead of Afghanistan's presidential runoff election, which will take place Saturday. The service members' unit came under rocket fire from Taliban militants. They called in air support. ""But the airstrike mistakenly bombed their own friends too,"" said Ghulam Sakhi Roghliwanai, the police chief of Zubair province where the incident took place. Their families spoke to CNN affiliates and local newspapers, painting a picture of determined soldiers whose love for their country was rivaled equally by their love for their family. Their deaths bring to 2,328 the number of Americans who have died since the Afghan war began in October 2001. Here is a snapshot of four of the five service members. CNN is waiting to confirm the identity of the fifth: . Justin Clouse, 22 . Clouse joined the Army a year after graduating high school in Sprague, Washington. He was on his second tour in Afghanistan as a gunner. ""He always wanted to service his country,"" his mother, TIna, told the Spokesman Review newspaper. He had planned to leave the Army next May, marry his fiancee, study engineering and find a job in the oil industry, his mother told the paper. Justin Helton, 24 . Like Clouse, Helton too was engaged to be married. His family told CNN affiliate WBNS that his fiancee moved from Columbus, Ohio, to Fort Bragg in North Carolina to be closer to him. His friends were all looking forward to his return. ""I've never had a feeling like this,"" friend Tim Hattle told the TV station. ""It just pulled the life right out of me."" Hattle said he'll most miss Helton's easygoing personality. ""He was just an all-around great guy,"" said Hattle. ""Never seen him angry or get upset. Always lifts up people around him."" Aaron Toppen, 19 . Toppen, of Mokena, Illinois, was a private who had been deployed to Afghanistan in March. ""I've known the Toppens for years. They're good people, and Aaron was a good boy, and he was excited about going into the military,"" neighbor Larry Bettenhausen told CNN affiliate WGN. In a Facebook post, his sister, Amanda, called him ""my biggest hero and the bravest man I know."" Scott Studenmund, 24 . Studenmund knew he wanted to serve his country from a very young age, his family told CNN affiliate KTLA. He had been a Green Beret and an Army staff sergeant, they said. ""He worked his way up the ladder in rank,"" neighbor Marlin James told the station. ""They were so proud of him. We were all very proud of him."" CNN's Masoud Popalzai in Kabul contributed to this report.","The five were killed when a coalition jet mistakenly bombed them .

"(CNN) -- The Nigerian government is up against a wall. The inability to locate the more than 200 school girls abducted a month ago has embarrassed the government and forced President Goodluck Jonathan to appeal for foreign help as Nigeria's five-year struggle with terrorist group Boko Haram escalates. It does seem that Nigerians are caught in the difficult position of having to welcome the help and be deeply wary of it. On the one hand we know, from the evident helplessness of our government, that we're at the point where we cannot make any progress without the skills and knowledge and technology that Western countries will bring to this battle. On the other hand, there are questions (running the gamut of conspiracy theory to reasonable concern) about America's motivations, and its track record. ""I have my reservations,"" says Debo Bashorun, a retired Nigerian army major who served as press secretary to military president Ibrahim Babangida in the late 1980s, and is now a vocal critic of the Nigerian military. ""[Now] this is a good time [for the Americans] to do what they've always wanted to do,"" Bashorun says. He's referring to the U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM), run by the U.S. Department of Defense, and established by President George W. Bush in 2007. From early on African leaders opposed attempts to site AFRICOM's headquarters in Africa. On his first official trip to Washington as president in December 2007, on the invitation of President Bush, Nigeria's President Yar'Adua made comments that were interpreted back home to mean that Nigeria was acceding to America's AFRICOM-in-Africa push. Outrage in Nigeria compelled the president to declare that he ""did not agree that AFRICOM should be based in Africa."" ""What we discussed with [President] Bush is that if they have something to do for Africa that has to do with peace and security, they should contribute. I told him that we African countries have our own plan to establish a joint military command in every sub-region ..."" he said. Segun Adeniyi, Yar'Adua's spokesperson, says those comments displeased America. ""[By] openly repudiating the idea of AFRICOM, Nigeria's relationship with the U.S. on Yar'Adua's watch had started on a very bad note. It was a relationship that would remain at a less-than-inspiring note throughout his tenure,"" Adeniyi writes in his book, ""Power, Politics and Death,"" an account of the Yar'Adua administration. Nigerians are right to be wary of America's military intentions, with the cautionary tales of countries like Iraq and Pakistan. ""This is a transactional relationship; there's nothing strategic about it,"" said Ehsan ul-Haq, retired Pakistani general and one-time head of the country's Intelligence Agency ISI, of U.S.-Pakistani military relations, at a reporting seminar for journalists which I attended in London in 2011. He added that the cumulative value of U.S. military assistance to Pakistan ($20 billion at that time, he said) paled into insignificance compared to Pakistan's losses from the war on terror --- which he put at not less than $68 billion. Bashorun echoes those views. ""America will not do it out of honest intentions,"" he told me. ""It's a matter of giving you 10 naira and in the long run they will collect 50 naira,"" he says. But he is pragmatic enough to realize that at this point Nigeria has got little choice in the matter. ""If we had done what we were supposed to have done, things wouldn't have turned out like this,"" he says. Then again there's the strong possibility that suggestions of the United States turning Nigeria into another Iraq or Pakistan are unfounded. Anonymous Nigerian defense blogger, Beegeagle, points out that Nigeria has long enjoyed significant levels of cooperation with the United States, in terms of receiving donations of hardware and training. ""The difference in this latest American effort is that the U.S are going to collaborate with Nigeria in the field --- an undisguised first,"" he wrote in an email message to me. But even that field work, he says, will not involve ""putting [American] soldiers on the ground to fight alongside Nigerian soldiers."" That will no doubt be comforting to many observers. But there's obviously still a lot that needs to be clarified regarding the extent and mode of foreign help Nigeria will be getting. For now the solidarity mounts; at the last count America, Britain, China, Canada, France and Israel had already thrown in offers of assistance. Nigerians will of course continue to be wary, and quick to bristle at any threats, real or imagined, to Nigeria's sovereignty. It doesn't help that many Nigerians believe, on the strength of pessimistic American assessments of Nigeria's fate, that its inclinations towards their country are sinister. And Nigerians have been there before. Shortly after Independence in October 1960, Nigeria's Parliament formally approved the terms of a controversial ""Anglo-Nigerian Defence Pact,"" which the Nigerian public had come to believe would give the departing colonial power the right to set up military bases in Nigeria. The protests that followed, led by student and labor groups, resulted in the speedy repeal of the agreement by the Federal Government barely a year-and-half later.

"(CNN) -- A few months ago, after drinking scorpion shots with Zappos' CEO Tony Hsieh, he gave me a tour of the Downtown Project, a formerly blighted neighborhood in Las Vegas being revitalized. Hsieh and others are investing $350 million to help turn the desert town into the smartest city in the world. Sound ambitious? It is. Hsieh's interest in cities strikes many people as a curiosity, given his track record at Zappos. Talk to him (especially over scorpion shots), and you find out it's actually the reverse. ""Every time the size of a city doubles, innovation per person increases, but when a company gets bigger, innovation per person goes down. Why is that?"" he asked. ""In a city,"" he explained, ""people and businesses are self-organizing. We're trying to do the same thing at Zappos."" Part of that goal involves moving Zappos to holacracy -- an organizational system that throws out all job descriptions, job titles, management (as we know it), and the organization chart, and starts over. Since Zappos' announced this move, people have wondered whether holacracy is just another fad or something to be taken seriously. Let's take a closer look at holacracy. (Full disclosure: I endorsed Hsieh's book ""Delivering Happiness,"" and he wrote the preface for my book, ""Tribal Leadership."" He's spoken to my USC classes, and I've spoken at several Zappos events.) You should care about holacracy because it tries to fix many things we all hate about companies, including: . 1. The organization chart on the wall has nothing to do with how people do their jobs. 2. The title you have probably doesn't reflect what you do, unless you own the company. 3. Your manager knows nothing about what you do much of the time, and yet makes decisions that determine your success. 4. Traditional management creates ""my life sucks"" cultures. If any of these problems sound familiar, then you and Hsieh (and many of us in the leadership world) are on the same page, so far at least. Holacracy was pioneered by Brian Robertson and outlined in his upcoming book, ""Holacracy: Evolution for Organizations."" The basic building block is a role, which is a breakdown of the organization's work. Roles work together in ""circles"" that self-organize. Circles can spawn sub-circles, and connect with other circles with ""links""â€”roles that form conduits between circles. People ""energize"" roles, and one person can energize multiple roles. Circles have regular governance meetings in which people talk about roles, accountabilities, authority and policies. If this description (which I ran by Robertson word-for-word) sounds like he's been reading the rules of Monopoly translated into computer code by way of Burning Man, you're not far off. Holacracy is complex, and designed to be so. It is hard to implement. To date, Zappos is by far the largest adopter of holacracy. When it works, holacracy is amazing, so it's no wonder business leaders are paying attention. David Allen, author of ""Getting Things Done"" and founder of a consulting and training company that runs on holacracy, told me that after a tough adjustment period: ""The company becomes much like a well-tuned machine that, to some degree, is self-correcting. You don't have to spend a lot of time going through channels to get things handled."" So, will it work at Zappos? Probably. Holacracy requires a great culture, and people who value egalitarianism. It's not communism (despite what some critics are saying), but it does throw out conventional ideas of power and hierarchy. It helps if people are grounded in customer service, can tolerate weirdness, and can take a leap of faith into the unknown. If this description isn't your company, then holacracy will not be a great fit. Holacracy is not coming to a company near you, at least not in its current form. Few have the value set of Zappos and very few have great cultures. It remains to be seen whether it can scale to a company of Zappos' size. The real story here is that there are many new organizational forms out there, holacracy being one. Most emphasize ownership thinking, agile methods and great cultures. Like cell phones in the 1980s, these new organizational models are big, bulky and hard to use. Many don't work at all. But over time, some of them will become sleek, easy to use, more powerful, and even elegant. Holacracy may just surprise us. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dave Logan.","Zappos is trying out holacacy, an organizational system that does away with hierarchy .
David Logan: Holacracy tries to fix many things we all hate about companies .
He says as a company gets larger, innovation per person tends to go down .
Logan: Holacracy might just work at Zappos because of its unique culture ."
"(CNN) -- Iceland -- the land of otherworldly vistas, air travel-disrupting volcanoes and polite, stylish Vikings -- already feels remote. In Westfjords, a lonely peninsula that juts out like a thumb into the Denmark Strait toward Greenland, it seems even more so. Here the weather can change in a heartbeat -- sunny afternoons quickly swallowed by icy winds and low clouds filled with fat snowflakes. It's six hours by road from Reykjavik, the Icelandic capital, but be warned: Driving the twisting routes of Westfjord's wind- and snow-whipped mountain passes can be hair-raising. For those who make the journey (a four-wheel-drive vehicle is recommended, as is a sense of adventure) the region's natural features, eating options and activities are worth the white-knuckle ride. Patreksfjordur . Patreksfjordur may not be much to look at, but it's only 45 minutes from a ferry terminus (Smidjustigur 3, Stykkisholmur; +354 433 2254) that offers a shortcut to get here. The village offers lodging and eating options that include the new Fosshotel Westfjords (Adalstraeti 100; +354 456 2004). This puts you close to some of the natural wonders of the region, such as the bird cliffs at Latrabjarg and the beautiful beach at Raudasandur. There are just a few restaurants in this small fishing town. The best is the Fosshotel's Fjall og Fjara restaurant -- it offers entrees such as foal steak, crispy-skin salmon, and seafood pasta. Isafjordur . The diminutive, charming town of Isafjordur (population 2,600) is located on the Skutulsfjordur fjord and is a well equipped hub for visitors exploring the region. Its residents are proud of their remote, rugged location. ""A common joke ... is that since there's mountains on all sides, you only need a lid over it,"" says Haukur Magnusson, an Isafjordur native who edits Reykjavik Grapevine, an English-language magazine. ""It feels like ... the mountains are protective of you. It feels like a haven from the outside world, especially to someone who grew up here."" Tjoruhusid . One of the best seafood restaurants in the Westfjords, and really all of Iceland, Tjoruhusid (Nedstakaupstad 400; +354 456 4419), occupies a beautiful old building at the Isafjordur harbor's edge. Here, Magnus Hauksson and his wife, Ragnheidur Halldorsdottir, serve the catch of the day and fresh vegetables in homey yet refined dishes along with a small selection of beer and wine. There's no menu -- Hauksson cooks whatever is fresh, such as Atlantic catfish in a mustard cream sauce. The atmosphere is warm and comfortable, and the food simple and remarkably delicious. Bolungarvik . Just north of Isafjordur, via a long tunnel that bores through a mountainside, lies the village of Bolungarvik. This small community feels like it's at the edge of the world, with stunning and dramatic views of snow-covered plateaus and mountains. A short drive from the town center leads up Bolafjall, a mountain that locals claim offers clear day views across the strait to Greenland. (Don't get too excited -- few days are clear.) It's also a prime place to see the northern lights during late autumn and winter. Museum of Icelandic Sorcery and Witchcraft . Siggi Atlason, curator of the Museum of Icelandic Sorcery & Witchcraft (Hofdagata 8-10; +354 897 6525) in the small town of Holmavik, looks the part with his gnome-like hat, wool sweater and pointy beard. Holmavik is located about 220 kilometers (135 miles) southeast of Isafjordur in the Strandir (or ""the coast"") region of the Westfjords. The museum details Iceland's macabre and bizarre historical belief in the supernatural, with items such as ""necropants,"" trousers reputedly made from human skin that were said to grant the wearer financial success. Fortunately, many of the grizzly oddities in the museum aren't real. ""The necropants are a replica,"" says Atlason. ""It is one of the fascinating folklore stories you find in Icelandic culture, but the story is good."" Hellulaug Hot Spring . This beautiful geothermal hot spring is located near Flokalundur, not far from where the ferry to the Westfjords docks along the south coast. Flokalundur can't really be called a town, but there's somewhere to stay: The Hotel Flokalundur (Vatnsfirdi; +354 456 2011). The hot spring isn't hard to find. There's a parking area with a path down to the spring, which is situated against a cliff looking out at the ocean. At about 38 degrees C (100 F), it's warm enough to soak in on a winter day, but easier to deal with than some Icelandic hot springs that simmer above 40 C. Latrabjarg . These lofty cliffs, Iceland's westernmost point, are about a 90-minute drive from Patreksfjordur. Huge numbers of birds roost here, including puffins, northern gannets, guillemots and razorbills. At 440 meters, these are the highest bird cliffs in Europe and are a paradise for bird watchers and nature enthusiasts. The nearby Hotel Latrabjarg (Fagrihvammur, Orlygshofn; +354 456 1500) is open in summer months. Raudasandur . Raudasandur is exactly what it sounds like -- a red sand beach. It stretches for 10 kilometers along the southern shore of the Westfjords. There are almost no facilities here, but it's a great place to walk and enjoy the region's natural beauty and isolation. In summer months, the water warms up to a brisk 16 or 17 C, so it's possible to swim. There are no hotels or guesthouses in the immediate vicinity, but visitors can stay in nearby Patreksfjordur to the north or the Hotel Flokalundur to the east. Sudureyri Outdoor Geothermal Pool . It seems like almost every Icelandic town has its own naturally heated geothermal pool, and the one in the village of Sudureyri is a local favorite (Sudureyrartuni; +354 450 8490). The mountainous backdrop can't be beat -- bathers enjoy coffee and ice cream as they soak in one of two hot tubs or after doing laps in the main pool. Jonah Flicker is a freelance writer based in Brooklyn, NY. His work has appeared in publications including the Los Angeles Times, LA Weekly, Paste Magazine, the Village Voice and Reykjavik Grapevine.","The peninsula of Westjords is Iceland's most remote region, six hours' drive from Reykjavik .

"(CNN) -- A former General Services Administration official who organized a lavish 2010 Las Vegas conference that critics lambasted as a waste of taxpayer money was indicted Thursday by a federal grand jury in San Francisco. Jeffrey Neely, who was famously photographed in a bathtub in a Las Vegas hotel room with wine glasses nearby, had served as a GSA regional commissioner. Neely was indicted on three counts of making false claims, one count of using false documents and one count of making false statements, according to court documents. Each charge is punishable by five years imprisonment and a $250,000 fine. The indictments allege Neely asked the GSA to pay for two trips to Las Vegas as well as trips to Long Beach and Cambria, California, knowing they weren't for business purposes. He's also being prosecuted for an allegedly false travel voucher filed for roundtrip airfare between Guam and Saipan. During 2012 hearings, members of Congress sharply criticized the GSA for lax oversight of billions of dollars in contracts and called for the agency to clean house as it roots out corruption. Neely cited his Fifth Amendment rights and refused to testify. The scandal came to light when a GSA inspector released a report shedding light on the Las Vegas conference as well as violations of travel and spending rules. Among other details, the report explained how Neely, and presumably others, avoided strictures against supplying food at government work conferences such as the Las Vegas event by creating joke awards in order to hold ceremonies at which food would be allowed. It was not clear from the indictment what occurs next in the case, or what Neely's status was on Thursday. Neely is expected to make his first court appearance on October 20.","A federal grand jury indicts Jeffrey Neely on five counts .

"(CNN) -- Hayatullah Dawari is a former doctor in Philadelphia who treated American troops in his native Afghanistan while working with the American Red Cross, according to his lawyer. But in the eyes of the United States government, Dawari has been working with an anti-Western insurgent group in Afghanistan with ties to al Qaeda. These two very different images of Dawari emerged after he appeared Friday in federal court in Philadelphia on immigration fraud charges. ""We intend to prove he was a member of HIG while he lived back in Afghanistan and Pakistan,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Jennifer Arbittier Williams told CNN. She was referring to Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin, an Afghan political party and militant organization founded by a man the U.S. Treasury Department has designated a terrorist. According to court documents, Dawari has been in touch with HIG associates in Pakistan and in January was the intended recipient of a book sent from Pakistan containing a secret message glued between two pages. The note, when translated to English, ""appears to contain a coded message directing some urgent action,"" according to court documents. ""He has no idea what they're talking about,"" said Nino Tinari, Dawari's attorney. ""There are no coded messages. There was no reason to have any coded message."" According to Tinari, Dawari planned on using the book, which was intercepted by the FBI before Dawari was able to receive it, to teach children at his mosque. Tinari told CNN affiliate WPVI that his client may have treated members of terrorist organizations as a doctor in Afghanistan before coming to the United States in 2008 but that he himself is not a terrorist. The government has not charged Dawari with any terrorism charges. The court case stems from charges of immigration fraud. According to court documents, Dawari neglected to document his association with HIG in a 2013 application for U.S. citizenship. On the application, he was asked, ""Have you ever been a member of or associated with any organization, association, fund, foundation, party, club, society, or similar group in the United States or in any place?"" He placed an ""X"" in the box marked ""No,"" the court papers said. The prosecution alleged that Dawari confirmed his membership in the group during a telephone call within weeks of submitting his naturalization application. Court papers described HIG as a ""violent, anti-western terrorist group ... affiliated with al Qaida, and it has claimed responsibility for many attacks against U.S. and coalition forces."" Dawari, 62, who pleaded not guilty Friday, was ordered held without bail. The prosecution argued that Dawari is a severe flight risk and a serious danger to the community. If convicted, Dawari faces a maximum charge of 20 years' in prison and deportation. The all-American al Qaeda suicide bomber . CNN's Haimy Assefa contributed to this story.","Hayatullah Dawari, 62, is a former doctor who reportedly has worked with the Red Cross .

"(Wired) -- To look at an ancient globe is to look at the Earth as it was seen by the people of another time. It reflects their understanding of the continents and seas, and it captures political divisions that have long since shifted. Even the typography and colors of a globe are indicative of the time and place of its origin, says Sylvia Sumira, a London-based conservator of ancient globes. Often, it's a thing of remarkable craftsmanship and beauty. ""If you go into a room and there's a globe, your attention is immediately drawn to it,"" Sumira said. In her lavishly illustrated new book, Globes: 400 years of exploration, navigation, and power, Sumira traces the history and making of globes and showcases dozens of fine examples drawn largely from the collection of the British Library. Contrary to the popular misconception that nobody knew the Earth was round before Columbus, the ancient Greeks described the making of globes (in verse, no less) in the third century B.C. The oldest surviving globe dates back to 150 A.D. But they really took off between about 1500 and 1900, and it's this period that's the focus of Globes. Read more: 5 new record-breaking rides that will terrify you this Summer . There are records of globes being brought on ships during the age of exploration, but they probably weren't used for navigation, Sumira says. For one thing, any globe that's small enough to be brought on board would have to be scaled down to the point of being useless for charting a course on the high seas. ""They're more a symbol of navigation than a tool for navigation,"" she said. In the book, she writes that in the 17th century, globes were sold as ""handsome objects of status and prestige to a comfortable merchant class."" Not that ancient globes don't convey some useful information. Much of it is contained in the horizon ring that surrounds many of them. Concentric circles printed or engraved on the ring indicate the degrees of the compass, the months of the year, zodiac signs, and sometimes information about winds. They can be used, for example, to determine the sunrise and sunset on a given day of the year, Sumira says. ""Most of the globes were like little calculating machines."" Read more: Striking photos of the rooms where VIPs shape history . Several globes in the book come in pairs: one terrestrial, one celestial. ""The constellations were very much used for navigational purposes,"" Sumira says, so being able to study pairs like this would have been very instructive for mariners in training. The celestial globes sometimes look like someone let the animals out of the zoo: the stars that make up a constellation are overlaid on the figure that gives it its name â€” a lion for Leo, a big bear for Ursa Major and so on. Getting your bearings with the celestial globes is a little tricky. It helps if you pretend you're God, looking down at the heavens from on high. The earth would be a dot inside the center of the globe. From this view, the constellations are mirror images of how they appear from Earth. Among Sumira's favorites are the pocket globes. ""They're just delightful little things,"" she said. The smallest is just 1.5 inches in diameter. Many come in a wood or leather case that opens up to reveal a terrestrial globe that can be taken out. The concave surface of the case often contains a matching celestial globe.

"London (CNN) -- A new generation of creatives are taking code to a more colorful realm, using digital media to push the boundaries of art. They are artists, architects, designers, musicians and game developers and their pioneering work includes interactive sculptures, wearable technology, immersive experiences and works built via crowd-sourcing. This expanding artistic frontier is celebrated in ""Digital Revolution,"" a new exhibition at London's Barbican, . A comprehensive survey of digital art from the 1970s to the present day, the exhibition traces the evolution of the digital art community and showcases the work of some of its most innovative practitioners. ""What we are doing is looking at digital practice across a range of art forms,"" said curator Conrad Bodman. ""The exhibition focuses on artists who use code as their material."" Digital artists come from all kinds of backgrounds, according to Bodman, and this is one of the show's key themes. ""Petting Zoo,"" (2012) by experimental architecture and design practice, Minimaforms, is typical of the interdisciplinary nature of digital art. It features animal-like creatures in the form of robotic arms that interact with the audience by tracking their movement. ""[It] is an interactive sculpture made using code by architects,"" Bodman said. ""Lines are blurred between art forms."" Interactivity is another key theme, said Bodman. ""Audiences can use their whole body ... you get a level of immersion you can't get with traditional art forms like painting,"" he added. Filmmaker and interactive artist Chris Milk's large-scale installation ""The Treachery of Sanctuary"" examines birth, life and death by using shadow play on three screens to create a poignant narrative that viewers can interact with. The installation uses Microsoft Kinect for Windows motion sensors, originally designed for the Xbox 360 video games console, which allow participants to interact with the installation using gestures and commands. One screen features a huge pair of wings, which are superimposed onto the participant's shadow. A wave of the arms will furl and unfurl the wingspan, more rapid motion will cause the creature to lift up from the ground and fly. ""People love to play with the wings ... especially kids. It's cool to see these tiny people with huge wings,"" said Brian Chasalow, an artist and programmer, who coded half of the installation. ""Someone came in in a wheelchair ... and you could feel that [being able to fly] was special for them,"" he added. Fashion label Cutecircuit creates interactivity of a different kind with wearable tech: A skirt whose pattern can be changed via an app and which you can send tweets to and a touch telecommunication T-shirt, The Hug Shirt, that allows people send each other cuddles remotely. ""Everything in our lives are connected apart from fashion, which is stuck in the Middle Ages,"" said co-founder Francesca Rosella who previously worked for Italian couture label, Valentino. ""[Our designs mean you can] communicate and express yourself in a more interesting way."" One high-profile fan is singer Katy Perry, who is regularly photographed wearing Cutecircuit's interactive haute-couture dresses on the red carpet. The exhibition also features a number of new commissions including ""Pyramidi,"" a collaboration by musician and technology advocate will.i.am and Japanese artist Yuri Suzuki. It features three robotic instruments -- piano, drums and guitar -- in the shape of pyramids in front of a huge projection of will.i.am in an ancient Egyptian headdress singing a song written for the installation. Each robot can be programmed to play music live. ""We are dreaming about the future of art and technology and the intersection of both,"" will.i.am said. Collaborator Suzuki added that the concept was from a ""vision of the future of music and music distribution,"" adding that it was a response to illegal downloading and the energy that artists spend on live shows. ""Each robot represents a musician ... it's a way of distributing music in a new way and performing a live concert...it's live but mechanical,"" he said. Another new commission is immersive installation ""Assemblance,"" by London-based Umbrellium who are known for their large-scale mass participatory interactive outdoor events. ""Assemblance"" is their first artwork for an indoor space and they say ""it blurs arbitrary distinctions between physical and virtual."" The installation features a blacked-out room filled with three-dimensional light fields that visitors can walk through and manipulate with their bodies to create luminous forms and release puffs of smoke and bubbles. ""We're interested in the participatory experience and how you can create trust and something bigger than yourself,"" said Usman Haque, one of the Umbrellium artists who created the work. ""It is actually very revealing of people."" ""The Brainwriter"" project, a technology that allows people to communicate with the outside world using just their brainwaves is debuted by The Not Impossible Foundation with a specially commissioned video game that allows visitors to try out the technology. ""The Brainwriter"" uses an EEG or brainwave sensor and eye-tracking technology to enable the fully paralysed to draw and communicate."" It is an extension of an earlier project, ""The Eyewriter,"" that Not Impossible made for graffiti artist TemptOne to allow him to draw again despite suffering from the neuro-degenerative condition, motor neurone disease. ""He started being able to communicate and started making art with his eye movements including a sculpture,"" said one of the designers, David Putrino. When he started to lose the ability to blink, Not Impossible came up with ""The Brainwriter"" to allow him to communicate by thought alone. ""We are interested in the idea of technology for the sake of humanity,"" Mike Ebeling, Not Impossible CEO said. ""All these examples [in this exhibition] are seeds and we think about how we can reapply them for fundamental social need. ""It's a playground ... and we ask ourselves, 'How can we hack that?'""

"(CNN) -- Months after ruling that Kentucky must recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states, a federal judge decided Tuesday that the state must conduct them as well. U.S. District Judge John G. Heyburn II on Tuesday ruled that Kentucky's same-sex marriage ban is unconstitutional, saying it violates the U.S. Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law. Heyburn's decision -- like his earlier one -- will not go into immediate effect at least until the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals rules on the matter. The state appealed the first case, and Kentucky's governor indicated Tuesday the state also will appeal the latest ruling. Heyburn ruled Thursday in a case brought by two same-sex couples who argued the state's law violated their rights. ""Ultimately, Kentucky's laws banning same-sex marriage cannot withstand constitutional review,"" Heyburn wrote in a 19-page opinion. He cited in part the Supreme Court's decision last year to strike down a federal law known as the Defense of Marriage Act, which had denied legally married same-sex couples the same federal benefits, including tax breaks, available to heterosexual couples. ""Assuring equal protection for same-sex couples does not diminish the freedom of others to any degree,"" Heyburn wrote. The office of Kentucky Gov. Steven Beshear said the state would appeal Tuesday's ruling, like Heyburn's earlier decision, ""so that the matter is fully before the 6th Circuit."" In February, Heyburn ruled that Kentucky's refusal to recognize out-of-state same-sex marriages violates the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause, the same rationale he used Tuesday, . Beshear, a Democrat, hired outside lawyers to defend the out-of-state ban, after his attorney general tearfully refused in March to take part in any further legal challenges. Beshear contended that ""Kentucky should be part of this process"" until the Supreme Court weighs in. Laura Landenwich, the lead attorney for the plaintiffs in Tuesday's case, said her clients were elated but still ""looking forward to that day when they can wed."" ""We regret that the commonwealth will spend more money on this appeal at certainly an unnecessary taxpayers' expense, but we're glad that (Beshear has) already made the decision so we can continue to fight,"" she said. With dozens of cases working their way through the court systems, more district judges could issue their own decisions affecting yet more states until the Supreme Court weighs in further. State-by-state: A frenzied few months on the same-sex marriage front . Same-sex marriage is legal in the District of Columbia and 19 states: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington. Massachusetts was the first to make it legal, in 2004. Worldwide, 16 countries -- and parts of Mexico -- also have laws allowing same-sex marriage and domestic partnerships. Most of the nations are in Europe and South America. Elton John: Jesus would support same-sex marriage . U.S. appeals court strikes down same-sex marriage ban in major ruling .

"(CNN) -- The main whistleblower in the scandal involving the Department of Veterans Affairs has asked for an independent review of delays in care at the Phoenix VA, calling the recent investigation by the Office of Inspector General a ""whitewash."" Dr. Sam Foote, a retired Phoenix VA doctor who will testify before Congress on Wednesday, says the VA's inspector general has downplayed the way in which employee manipulations of patient wait times contributed to deaths. ""In my opinion, this was a conspiracy, possibly criminal, perpetrated by senior Phoenix leaders,"" Foote said in his prepared testimony. ""The Inspector General tries to minimize the damage done and the culpability of those involved by stating that none of the deaths can conclusively be tied to treatment delays."" The report released by the inspector general in August states that no deaths at the Phoenix VA could be ""conclusively"" linked to long wait times. CNN has learned the VA's inspector general told congressional officials in a private briefing in August that 293 veterans died while waiting for care, though the deaths were not said to be caused by delays. That information was not included in the IG report released a few days later. Instead, the report described how 28 veterans had ""clinically significant delays"" in care, six of whom died. Foote said the number of veterans who died vastly exceeds his original allegations that 40 veterans died while waiting for care at the Phoenix VA. VA inspectors say Phoenix was in total 'chaos' and warn of more risk . Ahead of Wednesday's congressional hearing, the Acting Inspector General Richard Griffin defended the recent investigation but said the report cannot adequately express the personal losses involved. ""Our recent report cannot capture the personal disappointment, frustration and loss of faith of individual veterans and their family members with a health care system that often could not respond to their physical and mental health needs in a timely manner,"" Griffin said. For more than a year, CNN has been investigating and reporting on veterans' deaths and delays at VA facilities all across the country, including detailed investigations in November and January 2013 examining deaths at two VA facilities in South Carolina and Georgia. Foote first appeared on CNN in April, with detailed allegations that as many as 40 American veterans had died in Phoenix, waiting for care at the VA. Navy veteran loses his nose waiting for treatment . After Foote's revelations about Phoenix, numerous other whistleblowers stepped forward with similar charges of veterans' waiting for care and possible deaths of veterans who were waiting. The VA's inspector general opened investigations at 93 sites of care in response to allegations of wait time manipulations. To date, 12 investigations have been completed but 81 remain active and are being coordinated with the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, as appropriate. In May, after reports of patients dying while waiting for care at the Phoenix VA, Secretary Eric Shinseki was forced to step down. Robert McDonald was appointed this summer to take over the agency.

"(CNN) -- Troops joined rescue operations in Yunnan province, southwestern China Monday following a 6.1-magnitude earthquake but the search for survivors was hampered by rainfall and aftershocks. At least 398 people have been killed, and 1,801 injured by the quake that struck on Sunday afternoon, state-run media has reported. The quake struck at 4.30 p.m. local time (4.30 a.m. ET). The majority of the casualties occurred in the city of Zhaotong, Ludian County. The epicenter of the quake was recorded in Longtoushan Township, 23 kilometers (14 miles) southwest of Zhaotong, and tremors were felt almost 200 miles away. Hundreds of aftershocks have been recorded following the initial tremor. Beijing has allocated 600 million yuan ($97 million) for relief efforts, Xinhua reported Monday. It is a fairly remote, partly mountainous area. Many live in low-rise houses made of wood and bricks or plaster, which make them prone to collapse. Poor housing . The quality of the housing, along with the higher-than-average population density in the area and the relatively shallow epicenter of the quake, was said to be a contributing factor to the death toll. ""Most rural houses in the county were made of brick or wood, were not designed to be resistant to quakes, and many of them were outdated,"" the China Earthquake Administration said in a statement. Lu Xuefeng, head of Zhaotong City's communications department, told reporters Monday that an estimated 210,000 households and almost a million residents had been affected by the earthquake. He said local authorities had dispatched 6,000 troops to join the disaster relief operation, according to state media. They are joined by specially-trained functionaries, medical teams and thousands of volunteers. Civil authorities have distributed tents, folding beds, blankets and clothing. ""I was working ... when my family called and told me our home was destroyed,"" Mao Quan, a resident of Longquan village, Longtoushan Township, told CNN. ""They told me nearly all houses at the village have been destroyed in the earthquake. There's no shelter, not enough to eat and the roads are cut off so it's hard for aid to go in. I've been walking back to the village since 7 a.m. I tried to hitchhike but it's hard. I'll probably be back home in another two hours."" Some 12,000 homes were destroyed and 30,000 others damaged in Sunday's quake, according to CCTV. Tens of thousands have been relocated from structurally unsafe houses. Some roads have been destroyed and some villages remain cut off. Power outages . Ten towns and townships faced power outages overnight. Power was restored to around 19,000 homes Monday morning, but communications remain spotty. President Xi Jinping called for ""all-out efforts"" in relief operations late Sunday night, with top priority given to saving lives, minimizing casualties and providing adequate shelter for displaced victims of the disaster. Two commercial planes from carrier China Eastern Airlines have been used to fly rescue and medical teams close to the epicenter. Premier Li Keqiang, who visited stricken areas on Monday morning, also called for a swift response, urging local authorities to focus attention on search and rescue and also on providing adequate supplies and medical attention for residents affected by the disaster. Walking for several miles on foot to reach the worst-hit areas, he called on eight government ministries, including civil affairs, health, transport and housing, to send teams to take part in rescue and rehabilitation work. The scope of the disaster meant that medical facilities were in danger of being overwhelmed. Officials from Zhaotong urged people to give blood in order to make up a significant shortfall. Video of the site from CCTV shows rescue workers digging with their hands under several feet of rubble that included dirt, rebar and concrete blocks. Footage also showed injured adults and children being rushed to hospitals in ambulances. Power and telephone outages were complicating assessment of the damage, rescuers said. Rain is expected in the next few days, which authorities fear could impact rescue efforts. Condolences . The White House sent its condolences Sunday, and offered assistance. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of those that lost their lives, those injured or displaced, and all the people of China on this difficult day,"" National Security Council Deputy Spokesperson Bernadette Meehan said in a statement. ""U.S. disaster response officials are in contact with their Chinese counterparts. The United States stands ready to assist."" The United Nations echoed the sentiment. ""(The Secretary General) offers his condolences to the Chinese Government and the families of those killed, and his deepest sympathies to those who were injured or otherwise affected in this disaster,"" Secretary General Ban Kee Moon's spokesperson said in a statement, adding that the organization was ready to ""respond to humanitarian needs"" and to ""mobilize international support"" as needed. The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake had a magnitude of 6.1, while the China Earthquake Networks Center reported it as a 6.5-magnitude event. The area is a mountainous region, known for its natural scenery and ethnic diversity, but is also prone to natural disasters and lies on a major earthquake fault. Yunnan's neighboring province, Sichuan, witnessed a magnitude 7.9 earthquake in 2008 where at least 87,000 people died. Measuring the magnitude of earthquakes . What to know about earthquakes .

"Washington (CNN) -- The State Department discussed plans to transport non-U.S.citizens infected with Ebola to the United States for medical treatment, but decided to shelve the proposal and insists it was never considered at senior levels. But Congressional Republicans are seizing on an internal State Department memo outlining a possible joint State-Homeland Security department program to provide Ebola care at U.S. hospitals for non-Americans. They say the memo is evidence the Administration was working on a new plan but wasn't being transparent about it. The memo, obtained by CNN, is labeled ""SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED - PREDECISIONAL"" and drafted by State Department officials. It recommends that the two federal agencies come up with a system to admit into the United States non-citizens ""as long as they are otherwise eligible for medical evacuation from the Ebola affected countries and for entry in the United States."" It outlines the steps the U.S. government would need to take to contract with a commercial aviation company that specializes in bio containment. It also mentions other non-governmental agencies the U.S. is working with to assist with medevacing health care workers out of West Africa to European countries. Why U.S. Ebola patients seem to be recovering faster . In one section the memo says the U.S. has ""an obligation to assist non-citizen employees and contractors of U.S. agencies and programs, as well as NGOs and private firms based in the U.S."" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki dismissed the memo on Wednesday as drafted by a ""mid-level official, but not cleared by senior leaders."" Saying there are ""no plans"" to transport non-Americans who contract Ebola in West Africa to the United States, Psaki said the U.S. has ""discussed allowing other countries to use our medevac capabilities to evacuate their own citizens to their home countries or third countries, subject to reimbursement and availability. But we're not contemplating bringing them back to the United States for treatment."" House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte wrote a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson last week asking if the Administration was developing any plans related to non-U.S. citizens, but complained on Wednesday he hasn't received a response yet. On Wednesday he issued a written statement about the ""leaked memo,"" suggesting the Administration was trying to hide something. ""It's alarming that senior Obama Administration officials so vehemently denied the existence of any plans to transport non-U.S. citizens infected with Ebola to the United States for treatment when a leaked State Department document shows that such a proposal indeed exists and was approved by Obama Administration officials,"" Goodlatte said. Obama hits governors for 'hiding under the covers' from Ebola . But Psaki said the proposal never reached senior officials for their approval. The copy of the memo obtained by CNN does not include the final page that would show specifically which officials from the State Department signed off on the plan. Iowa Republican Senator Chuck Grassley also cited the memo as counter to the Administration's emphasis that stopping the spread of the virus means focusing on the source in West Africa. ""The Obama administration memo describing possible efforts to skirt the immigration laws and fast track the admission of people with Ebola fails to consider the risk to Americans and adds to the absurd refusal of the President to institute common sense travel restrictions that would better protect the homeland.""

"London (CNN) -- The village of Beddau in South Wales is sleepy, picturesque, and does not normally make national news. But it hit the headlines this month when a controversial sign was put up at the children's rugby club. ""Please remember! These are kids,"" it said. ""This is a game. The coaches are volunteers. The referees are human. This is not the Six Nations."" This sign was quickly reported by the press, and even featured on Today, BBC Radio's flagship politics and current affairs program. Clearly, the Beddau kids' rugby club had touched a nerve. Rugby culture is good-natured in Britain, and a sign of this sort is unusual. But a host of other junior pastimes, including soccer, Britain's national sport, is plagued by adult boorishness. In March, the Lancashire Football Association staged a ""silent weekend"" for all soccer teams aged seven to 18. Parents were allowed to applaud when players from both teams entered or exited the pitch, or scored a goal. Otherwise, they watched in silence. Neil Yates, the Football Association's county welfare officer, came up with the idea after seeing a nine-year-old boy reduced to tears during a game. ""He was genuinely scared,"" he said. ""Poor lad was simply terrified by all those baying adults."" By all accounts, the initiative was a success. But it was also a drop in the ocean. Last year, Gary Lineker, the legendary England footballer and television presenter -- who incidentally never received a single yellow card for unsporting behavior throughout his playing career -- lambasted ""maniacal parents on the touchline spouting nonsense at their children."" ""The competitive nature of most mums and dads is astounding,"" he wrote in an essay for New Statesman magazine. ""If we could just get them to shut the f--- up and let their children enjoy themselves, you'd be staggered at the difference it would make."" Lineker even went so far as to hold parents' behavior partially responsible for the stunted development of English soccer, which has ""never produced, proportionally, as many technically efficient players as most other countries."" Parental behavior on the touchlines is a deep-seated problem in the UK. A 2011 study by Edinburgh University found that three quarters of British children had endured ""unhelpful criticism of performance, being shouted and sworn at, being embarrassed and humiliated"". ""Disrespectful and emotionally harmful treatment of young people,"" it concluded, is ""commonplace in children's experience of sport in the UK."" It is also a problem elsewhere in the world. A definitive poll of 23,000 adults in 23 countries, carried out jointly by Reuters and Ipsos in 2010, found that 60% of Americans had witnessed bad behavior by a parent on a touchline. This was reflected by 59% of Indians; 55% of Italians; 54% of Argentinians; 53% of Canadians; and 50% of Australians. What lies behind this ugly trend? Partly, it has to be chemical. Studies have shown that spectators as well as players experience a flood of testosterone after a win, making it easy for parents to lose a sense of perspective when their children are competing. There are also convincing psychological explanations. The late Professor Tony Jurich, a pre-eminent family therapy expert at Kansas State University, blamed a lack of ""completeness"" in parents, leading to a belief that the child's successes are an extension of their own. All this pressure, he argued, is intensified by the fact that away from the sports field, cosseted modern life offers few opportunities for blood-and-guts heroics. Professor Jurich suggested that parents distance themselves from the action: the more likely you are to start yelling, the further away you should sit. ""For you it's venting, but for your kid it's damaging in so many ways,"" he said in an interview with his university magazine. ""They may start to feel that they're losers not only in the game, but in life."" Whatever the excuses, parents need to get a grip. But despite the success of initiatives like Silent Weekend, it would be a mistake to go to the other extreme and sanitize children's sports. Paul Tough's bestselling book ""How Children Succeed"" -- which has revolutionized thinking in America's public schools -- has demonstrated that qualities like grit, determination, optimism and discipline are key determinants of success in life. If such ""mental toughness"" cannot be forged on the sports field, how can it be developed at all? It may be ""only a game,"" but character-building is surely the whole point. Many adults tell epiphanic stories of the moment a tough-love adult gave them the self-belief and drive they needed, even though it was unpleasant at the time. My wife, for instance, credits a painful school athletics session, in which her coach refused to let her leave until she had jumped the highest hurdles, with her subsequent junior sporting success. For this to work, however, the overall context has to be healthy. Molly-coddling children may not do them any good, but any tough love must be designed to make them stronger, not break them. And for that to happen, the adults on the touchlines must learn to grow up -- whether their kids are playing rugby or anything else.","Parents putting pressure on kids playing sports becomes issue .

"(CNN) -- The African Wildlife Foundation is hoping to do some tricky medicine on the world at large. It's trying to stop the planet's lungs from collapsing. ""If you think of the world as having two lungs, the Amazon rainforest is one lung, and the Congo Basin forest is the second. It's a place everyone should be concerned about in a time of climate change,"" says Patrick Bergin, the organization's CEO. The Congo Basin is also home to the bonobo, forest elephants and Congo peacocks -- species whose survival is dependent on that of the surrounding forest. Bergin has launched an innovative program to save the environment, not just the one region, but on the whole African continent -- the cradle of civilization and potentially its ecological safe keeper. Over the next decade, the African Wildlife Foundation is building 15 conservation-themed primary schools in some of Africa's most remote regions -- areas that are also highly strategic from an environmental standpoint. The schools are designed to be state-of-the-art, built with attractive faculty housing that will hopefully lure some of Africa's best teachers. In exchange, the organization not only helps to shape young minds to further the cause, but gets written agreement from the local community to set aside a patch of land for conservation purposes -- a stretch that will be free form hunting, logging and unplanned agriculture. ""It's a bargaining tool,"" admits Bergin. ""[These communities] are rich in land, but poor in cash. We brought in a resource to help build a school, and we barter."" Education in the Bush . Bergin notes that when it comes to education in Africa, resources go first to schools in the city, then to those in the surrounding towns. ""Kids that live in the Bush are likely to be deeply disadvantaged,"" he says. It is precisely that segment, he argues, that needs access to good schooling to protect the future of the continent. ""When children do not get access to a good education, they're doomed to a life where exploiting natural resources is the only way to make a livelihood. If you can't get a skill or a job that allows you to enter the modern economy, harvesting bush meat, cutting trees -- these are your only options,"" he says. Sustainable schooling . Construction has already begun on the first school in Ilima, an extremely isolated village in the Democratic Republic of Congo that sits on the corridor between two protected areas. ""We work in a lot of parts of Africa that are remote, but this takes the cake,"" says Bergin. Getting there involves a two-day motorized canoe trip from Kinshasa, followed by a five-hour motorcycle ride. What that means is that getting materials in and out of the area can prove troublesome. Architectural firm MASS Design Group has partnered with the African Wildlife Foundation to build the schools. For the Ilima project, it was imperative that the designers used materials that are easy to source and replace. ""If there's a need to repair or maintain the school 45 years down the road, the community has to be able to do it without depending on materials like steel or cement, which would be hard to locate,"" says Andrew Brose, the project manager. Mass Design started by researching not just the materials in the region, but local construction methods. ""We've found that when you go into remote regions like this, the things people build are already climate-intellegent. They know how to build with rainfall in mind,"" says Michael Murphy, CEO of Mass Design. ""We look at how we can adapt and learn from what's already done quite well in the area."" The school is built primarily from mud bricks and local hardwood. Brose's team tested different soils and palm oils in the region to find which combination of ingredients would yield the most durable bricks. Factoring in the rainforest climate, which is prone to heavy rains and high heat, the school walls only go up two-thirds of the way to allow for cross breeze. Rain catchments will store water for agricultural uses. ""This building is one of the most sustainable we've ever built,"" says Murphy. A portal to the 'modern economy' Like Bergin, Murphy views the schools project as a means to really impact the continent. ""Our ambition is to have more systemic change through a better building process. It's not just a one-off project,"" he admits. For starters, Mass Design has trained local craftsmen in its techniques as a way of passing on the baton. ""They could build tens of thousands of schools in the next decade,"" says Murphy. ""As the population booms significantly in Africa, there will be a massive demand for low-cost, rural school construction.""","The African Wildlife Foundation is building conservation schools in rural Africa .

"(CNN) -- Officials are still trying to secure the release of dozens of U.N. peacekeepers from Fiji who were taken captive by al Qaeda-linked rebels from Syria. The peacekeepers were captured Thursday in the Golan Heights, a day after rebels seized control of a border crossing between Syria and the Israeli-occupied territory. Filipino peacekeepers, who also came under assault from the rebels, were all reported to be safe after slipping past the attackers. The peacekeepers are part of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, which has overseen a buffer zone in the Golan Heights since 1974 to maintain a ceasefire between Israel and Syria. Fighting from Syria's civil war spilled over into the buffer zone last week. Uncertain location . The Fijians' exact whereabouts remain unclear after they were forced from their position near the Syrian town of Quneitra by the rebels. They have access to food, water and medical supplies and are all believed to be in good health, Brig. Gen. Mosese Tikoitoga, the commander of the Fijian military, said in a statement Monday. But the United Nations said Sunday that ""no additional information on their status or location has been established."" An Israeli military official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told CNN last week that the peacekeepers were being held by members of the al Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front, one of the groups fighting the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The United Nations said it was continuing to ""actively seek their immediate and unconditional release."" There was conflicting information on the exact number of peacekeepers being held. The United Nations put the number at 44, but Fijian authorities said Monday there were 45. Al-Nusra released pictures online over the weekend that purported to show 45 peacekeepers and their U.N. identification cards. Filipinos escape . Other U.N. peacekeeping positions in the buffer zone have also come under attack since the capture of the Fijians. Rebel fighters advanced to surround two posts where Filipino peacekeepers were based and began to attack the positions on Saturday. The U.N. troops at one position were moved to safety. But the other post returned fire after coming under attack from mortars and machine guns. The exchange of fire prevented the peacekeepers from safely pulling back, the United Nations said. But the trapped peacekeepers then managed to escape early Sunday and get to Camp Ziuoani, which is on the Israeli side of the border, the official Philippines News Agency reported. Top military officials in the Philippines praised the peacekeepers' defense of their positions and dramatic escape, according to local media. 'Peacekeepers, not combatants' The U.N. force in the Golan Heights also includes troops from India, Ireland, Nepal and the Netherlands. Fijian and U.N. officials have been calling for the immediate release of the captive peacekeepers. ""These men are peacekeepers, not combatants in the Syrian conflict, and there is no need for them to be detained,"" Fijian Prime Minister J. V. Bainimarama said Friday. He said authorities were ""doing everything possible to secure their safe return."" U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has strongly condemned the detention of the peacekeepers. The Golan Heights border crossing made headlines earlier last week, when the al-Nusra Front handed over American journalist Peter Theo Curtis to U.N. peacekeepers on the Syrian side of the checkpoint. CNN's Ralph Ellis and Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","The detained troops are reported to have food, water and medicine, a Fijian official says .

"(CNN) -- From the single, centrally-positioned seat to the crash-proof frame, this Formula One-like car is an alluring piece of kit. It would make any driver stand out in a traffic jam, and it's completely road legal. But the truly ground-breaking feature of BAC's ultra-sleek design is still under wraps. The company are developing an autonomous rear wing that self-transforms according to the conditions. In rainy weather it curves to increase downforce for a safer drive, and straightens out when the downpour clears. This process is powered by the rain itself. The startling concept is the result of collaboration with MIT's pioneering Self-Assembly Lab, which seeks to programme materials to build themselves, and transform how we make things. ""Any place that uses robotics today, you could use materials and have the same capabilities,"" says Skylar Tibbits, a computational architect who leads the Lab and the movement. ""With planes, we have done a great job of making articulated wings to have lift, to change aerodynamics and make the plane functional. But the weight, energy and control mechanisms involved are pretty excessive at this point. Trying to find more elegant solutions seems an obvious target, and what we're proposing is a single material with the same actuation capability, the same sensing, the same range of movement, if not more."" The self-assembly process has been described as 4D printing. Tibbits' team produce composite materials that react in predictable ways when exposed to external stimulus such as water. The materials are 3D-printed into specific shapes and then autonomously transform into another, with wide-ranging implications for industry from automotive to medical to military. But the dream for a new paradigm of component-free, labor-sparing robotics requires further breakthroughs. ""More materials, more energy sources,"" Tibbits says are the current priorities. Wood and carbon fibers are responding well, but ""can we do it with everyday materials, with repeatability? Can we fuel it with heat and light?"" If he can, the results would not merely match existing capabilities. ""We can develop material compositions that respond to many different triggers, or find solutions that haven't been programmed but fall within an acceptable range. They could self-optimize based on logic and sensing."" Tibbits acknowledges that ""not every industry likes surprises,"" but the Lab's client list indicates a huge appetite for self-assembly. In addition to BAC, the team are collaborating with Airbus to develop the wing design. They are working with engineering giants Geosyntec to deliver autonomous pipes that expand, narrow and regulate the flow, taking on the function of pump and valve. Fashion and furniture are also targets -- making the self-lacing sneakers of 'Back to the Future' a possibility at last. The field is expanding. Harvard's Dr. Jennifer Lewis is leading a wide-ranging exploration of 4D printing, which recently received a grant from the US military, along with two other research institutions. Morphing camouflage is among the mooted targets. Demand for 4D is reaching a fever pitch, says Dr. Junus Kahn, founder of Carbitex, which produces the materials used by the Self-Assembly Lab, as well as supplying them to major business clients. ""Our clients are looking for the next big idea, they are actively seeking innovation and believe this could transform manufacturing,"" says Kahn. ""If you have products that know how to mould and assemble based on energy, it takes out the menial labor that has forced manufacturers to relocate abroad where it's cheaper."" Kahn believes transport is the fastest-progressing sector for the concept, and expects automotive examples to be on the market as early as 2016. Once self-assembly is proven, it could spread as rapidly as its precursor 3D printing, along with concerns about the implications. ""Everyone is always scared that technology will take our jobs,"" says Tibbits, rolling his eyes. ""But it has always created jobs rather than destroyed them. Another fear is it will get out of control, or be abused. But we should be afraid of people not technology, we shouldn't stop inventing."" If the full scale of his vision is realized, we might need to do little else. Read more from Make, Create, Innovate: .

Players are high on Republicans' chances of winning the six seats they need to take control of the Senate, putting the chances of that happening at 86% -- up three percentage points from Friday night. But they're also confident that two embattled Democratic senators will win re-election. North Carolina's Kay Hagan is up to 70%, while New Hampshire's Jeanne Shaheen is at 85%. Republicans are getting good news in Iowa, where their candidate, Joni Ernst, is at 73% -- as well as in Kentucky, where at 94% Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell currently looks like Pivit's surest thing.

"(CNN) -- Robin Thicke, Pharrell Williams and T.I. have lost the first round of their legal fight over ""Blurred Lines,"" their monster 2013 hit. The three artists have been in a lengthy standoff with the family of soul legend Marvin Gaye, which has alleged that ""Blurred Lines"" illegally copies Gaye's 1977 hit ""Got To Give It Up,"" among other complaints. Thicke, Williams and T.I. -- whose given name is Clifford Harris Jr. -- filed a pre-emptive lawsuit in August 2013 asking a federal judge in California to declare that ""Blurred Lines"" doesn't infringe on the copyright of ""Got to Give It Up."" The Gaye estate followed with a countersuit that accused Thicke of not only ripping off ""Got to Give It Up"" but infringing on the copyright of Gaye's ""After the Dance"" and having a ""Marvin Gaye fixation."" Marvin Gaye heirs sue 'Blurred Lines' artists . This tension came to a head on Thursday as U.S. District Court Judge John A. Kronstadt denied Thicke and Williams' request and ruled that the dispute should be aired out at trial. Though Thicke, Williams and T.I. contended in their suit that ""being reminiscent of a 'sound' is not copyright infringement,"" Thursday's ruling indicates the court believes that's a question for a jury to mull over. Both sides relied on the examination of musicologists to help make their arguments, but Thursday's ruling noted that the Gaye family has made ""a sufficient showing that elements of 'Blurred Lines' may be substantially similar to protected, original elements of 'Got to Give It Up.' "" According to The Hollywood Reporter, a trial is set for February 10. In a statement, the lawyer for Thicke and Williams said that Thursday's ruling isn't a surprise thanks to the ""extraordinary difficulty"" of trying to land a win at this stage of the process, ""especially where each side offers conflicting opinions from multiple musicologists."" That said, the stars' attorney added he and his clients are ""gratified"" that, per Thursday's ruling, ""the jury will need to decide this case ... limited to what is in the written composition, without being influenced by the sound recordings."" ""Blurred Lines"" stayed at the top of Billboard's pop chart for a record 16 weeks last year and sold more than 6 million copies, according to court documents.

"(CNN) -- Thousands of Honduran women and children leave the poverty and the violence in their communities to embark on a 1,500-mile journey through the heart of Mexican cartel territory to get into the United States. On ""The Beast"" -- the name given to the fast train that many ride through Mexico -- the stories are harrowing. Some die along the way. Others reach the ""land of the free'"" only to find themselves in immigration detention or shelters for unaccompanied children. Their individual stories often go untold for privacy, safety and security reasons. The Department of Homeland Security reports a dramatic decrease in the number of unaccompanied minors and adults with children crossing the border recently, a situation more like what we saw prior to the influx this spring and summer. Still, thousands are entering the country illegally each month. One woman has been adamant about getting the stories of these women and children first hand in the hopes of solving the problem. The first lady of Honduras, Ana Garcia de Hernandez, leads a commission, created by Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez, to solve the unaccompanied child crisis. She has visited shelters in the United States and Mexico, asking women and children about their arduous journey and the conditions that prompted them to flee. In this Q&A, translated from Spanish and edited for clarity and brevity, she sheds light on an issue that is close to her home and to her heart. CNN: You have talked with many women and unaccompanied children who have been detained by U.S. immigration authorities or repatriated to Honduras. What story resonates the most? Garcia de Hernandez: In my visits to several shelters and detention centers in McAllen, Texas, and Mexico ... every story has been hard for me to hear. I have talked to mothers and children who chose to leave the country in search of opportunity in the United States and have faced the risks of the migration route. I remember this particular case of a child who had spent 20 days kidnapped by ""coyotes"" because his dad had not finished paying them and stories of women who have been abused. In Mexico, I knew the story of a woman who was sexually abused in front of her husband and after that, she was attacked physically. As you can imagine, she was in a very difficult psychological situation. CNN: Why is it important for you to hear the stories of the women and the children in person? Garcia de Hernandez: For me, it is essential to be in the place where everything happens. In the United States, I visited several detention centers. I had the opportunity to talk with officials from the Border Patrol and got a chance to be at the point of crossing in the Rio Grande. In Mexico, I was in Tapachula, Tabasco, Palenque and the capital city. Back in Honduras, I received our citizens repatriated from Mexico on the border of Corinto and deported from the United States as well. When one hears closely the experiences of these families, there is a bigger desire and commitment to support and help them during this difficult time. CNN: In what ways do you think the United States handling of the influx of women and unaccompanied children could be improved? Garcia de Hernandez: For my husband, President Juan Orlando Hernandez, it has always been important that each case should be viewed on an individual basis. Every child, every woman and every family is a different story of life, and they are entitled to have their human rights respected and to have the option to have a judge defend their case and explain their situation and hope for asylum. Each case is a different story. CNN: As a woman, mother and wife, what frustrates you the most about the violence that is forcing young women and children to flee Honduras? Garcia de Hernandez: It is a combination of many feelings. From one side we recognize that there is violence in the country, and believe me, we are fighting hard to eradicate it. We also know there are a lot of missing job opportunities, but my husband and the government are focused on social issues to generate these opportunities of development in Honduras. Also, there's misinformation coming from the organized crime networks, where human traffickers are doing business with the pain of Honduran families. They don't care if they have to risk the lives of children in the process of smuggling them into the country. CNN: Hundreds, if not thousands, of unaccompanied Honduran children have been released to sponsors in the United States and are being enrolled in American schools right now. What is your message to those Honduran children who are now beginning a new, uncertain life in the United States? Garcia de Hernandez: What worries me the most is what is happening with these more than 15,000 Central American children who have entered this way to the United States. And those who have already been released to their parents or a sponsor, I wonder if these kids are actually in school, if they receive medical attention and especially if they get psychological counseling for the trauma they experienced on this trip. I imagine them entering a country where they don't know the language and in many cases these children do not even know their parents. Sometimes they only know their voices on the telephone. I ask the government of the United States to provide these children with all the assistance they really need.","First Lady of Honduras has visited shelters in U.S. and Mexico .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. has a ""winning strategy"" to defeat ISIS, the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff told CNN's Kyra Phillips in an exclusive interview on Wednesday. He added that he ""can't foresee"" sending ""large ground combat forces into Iraq."" Gen. Martin Dempsey also touched on his concerns about the spread of the Ebola virus and what's more to come in the coalition battle against murderous Islamic extremists. ISIS has inched closer to the Iraqi capital Baghdad this week and continued fighting in strategically important Anbar Province. Is it possible that ISIS could gain control of Baghdad? ""I don't see that happening,"" he said. ""I'm confident we can assist the Iraqis to keep Baghdad from falling."" However, Iraqi forces, some of whom abandoned their posts when ISIS began its assault on Iraq, need more training, Dempsey said. Still, they have ""established a fairly formidable defensive perimeter around Baghdad"" that Dempsey characterized as ""a very thick and deep defense."" Dempsey repeated what he said before Congress weeks ago, stressing that doesn't see a need to put troops on the ground in the fight against ISIS. He was firm on the controversial notion that American troops could once again head back into Iraq to fight after being involved in a conflict that stretched from 2003 to 2011. And yet he also told CNN that ""war is discovery"" and that if the situation evolves to the point where ground troops are necessary, he will evaluate that and make recommendations to President Barack Obama. There are 12 teams of military advisers in Iraq now, he said. Dempsey said the U.S. got a ""significant commitment"" from other members of the international coalition to add advisory teams. Dempsey said the plan is to set up three bases where the U.S. and others can train Iraqi security forces who are battling ISIS on the ground, along with Kurdish fighting forces. He then reiterated that ""war is discovery,"" stressed that ISIS is a ""national security threat"" and said that airstrikes alone will not beat ISIS though they have forced the group to change ""the way it's moving."" Fighting ISIS is going to take ""patience,"" Dempsey said, so it's critical that the U.S. and the coalition show progress soon. For now, ""we're on the right path."" Dempsey also revealed that the international coalition's operation against ISIS has a name: ""Inherent Resolve."" The name, to him, means that ""we need to be able to be credible and sustainable over time in order to accomplish the mission that we've been given."" 'We gave Iraq a chance' The chairman put much of the blame for the growth of ISIS on the Iraqi government. Despite airstrikes and international outrage, the terror group is overrunning Iraqi forces and making significant strides in Syria. ""We gave Iraq a chance -- an opportunity,"" Dempsey said, talking about the war. ""They failed to take that opportunity."" ""The coaching, and teaching, and mentoring, the thousands of interactions at the local level were all wasted by the government of Iraq that chose deliberately to follow a sectarian agenda and alienate entire segments of the population, which created an environment in which ISIL could return and could flourish,"" he said, using an alternative acronym for ISIS. When asked who in the U.S. government underestimated ISIS, Dempsey said: ""I think what we all probably missed was the degree to which the Iraqi armed forces had eroded and wouldn't stand and face ISIL. I think we all missed that."" Dempsey alarmed about Ebola months ago . The chairman said he has been concerned about Ebola as a global threat for at least 90 days. ""I'm worried about it because we know so little about (Ebola),"" he said, adding that his worry is stoked by seemingly conflicting information about how the virus can be spread. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that the deadly virus, which originated in Africa, can be passed only through direct contact with bodily fluids when a person suffering from it exhibits symptoms. ""If you bring two doctors who happen to have that specialty into a room, one will say, 'No there is no way it will ever become airborne, but it could mutate so it could be harder to discover,' "" and another might say something completely different, Dempsey said. He said he is alarmed by the World Health Organization's warning that Ebola cases could increase and the virus could mutate. ""Then it will be an extraordinarily serious problem,"" he said. ""I don't know who is right. I don't want to take that chance, so I am taking it very seriously.""","NEW: Chairman of Joint Chiefs faults the Iraqi government .

"Washington (CNN) -- Former Massachusetts governor and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney dodged questions again on whether he'd consider mounting a third bid for the White House in an interview Monday, singling out another former governor instead. ""If you look at (the 2016 Republican field) and see no Jeb Bush, no Chris Christie, no one who you think can raise the money and compete against the Democratic nominee then you'll think about it?"" Mark Halperin, co-host of Bloomberg's ""With All Due Respect,"" asked Romney in an interview Monday night. ""I think Jeb is an excellent person, could be a terrific president,"" Romney said, predicting a wide field of ""15 or so people on the stage at the first debate."" ""I'm not running, I'm not planning on running, and I got nothing new on that story,"" he said. Romney shifts spotlight to McConnell . While viewers didn't learn anything new about Romney's plans, they did get another peek into Romney's personal side -- which has emerged more and more from the guarded image of Romney that voters were exposed to two years ago. In an evolution from his stiff, buttoned-up demeanor that was often lampooned during his previous White House runs, Romney dished in the interview on his favorite television show, his grandchildren and even a leg massage. On ""Downton Abbey"": ""I think the show was most enjoyable in the first season. Then when Matthew (Crawley) went off to war, it was a bit of a departure for a few seasons,"" Romney said, straight-faced. ""I actually like the downstairs part more than the upstairs part, even though I think Mary (Crawley) is an absolutely delightful character and I love watching her."" ""Are we really talking about 'Downton Abbey'?"" he said, laughing. Romney's wife, Ann, spoke previously about her family's penchant for the British drama in July 2012, prompting Halperin's question.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- The Chilean miners who were rescued last month after nearly 70 days underground were saluted with a standing ovation at the start of ""CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute."" The 33 men appeared on stage, with five of their rescuers in the front row, at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. CNN brought the group to the United States to attend the gala event, which recognizes the top 10 CNN Heroes of the year. ""For 69 days we were amazed by these 33 brave miners,"" CNN's Anderson Cooper said in welcoming the miners onto the stage. ""Their ordeal was unthinkable; their rescue, unbelievable. No one has ever been trapped underground so deep for so long and survived. ""They endured a nightmare, experienced a miracle, and in the end became each others' brothers and heroes."" After the miners sang the Chilean national anthem, two of them -- speaking through a translator and holding the Chilean flag -- expressed their appreciation. ""We want to thank the world, and we want to thank God for your prayers,"" Luis Urzua told the audience in Spanish. ""Our families suffered. Our children suffered, too. But thanks to the prayers of the whole world, we could come out of this difficulty,"" Mario Sepulveda added. ""Some of our rescuers are here with us tonight,"" Urzua said. ""Thank you for bringing us home. You are our heroes."" The five rescuers were selected to represent the many thousands whose talent and effort led to the dramatic rescue. The tribute show, taped November 20, premiered worldwide on Thanksgiving night. CNN Heroes -- everyday people who are changing the world for the better -- have been profiled weekly on the network since January.

"(CNN) -- It started with balloons. But the latest strife between North and South Korea hasn't been resolved, despite a meeting between top military leaders from both countries Wednesday at the Panmunjom border site -- their highest-level talks in seven years. The meeting is just the latest unusual and intriguing move North Korea has taken, heightening a growing mystery about what exactly is going on in the secretive nation. The most recent battle between the uneasy neighbors springs in part from the release of balloons carrying anti-Kim Jong Un messages. Activists from South Korea set the balloons to fly over North Korea, which responded by shooting them down. Then the two sides exchanged fire. At a news conference in Seoul, a spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry portrayed Wednesday's talks as a goodwill measure, even as both sides largely reiterated their positions. ""The meeting today, because there was a strong will to improve ties between the South and North, it was carried out in an earnest atmosphere,"" said Kim Min-seok. ""Because this was the first such meeting, positions from each side could not be narrowed down,"" Kim said, adding that there was no set date for any further meetings. A missing leader and an overture to the U.N. The meeting happened this week amid speculation over the whereabouts of Kim Jong Un, who hasn't been seen in public since September 3, when he attended a concert with his wife. On Tuesday, North Korean state media published the first pictures of Kim in more than a month, in an apparent attempt to quash rumors that something may be awry. Some wonder if his absence could mean a power shift is imminent, while others speculate that it might indicate the so-called ""Dear Leader"" is ill. Read more: Is Jong Un still in charge? KCNA reported that in the photos, Kim was seen giving ""field guidance"" to a newly built residential district and had visited the Natural Energy Institute of the State Academy of Sciences. Perhaps also to detract from talk about Kim's whereabouts, North Korean officials made the very rare move of taking questions at the United Nations and coordinating talks about human rights with the European Union. Read more: Why has North Korea decided to talk now? Their overture to discuss human rights came after a U.N. Commission of Inquiry issued a report detailing abuses in North Korea that investigators said were tantamount to crimes against humanity. The report said Pyongyang leaders commit murder and torture and enslave people and enact sexual violence and mass starvation against its own people to prop up the state. One women held in a prison in North Korea said she gave birth under the grimmest of conditions and when her baby wouldn't stop crying, she was beaten by a guard as punishment. The woman claims, according to the report, that she was forced to hold her infant under water until it died. North Korean leaders terrorize ""the population into submission,"" according to the commission's findings. The panel said it would refer the findings to the International Criminal Court. The commission also sent a letter to Kim saying that he could be prosecuted for crimes against humanity. Read more: 'Abundant evidence' of North Korea crimes against humanity .

"Washington (CNN) -- Republican Scott Brown lost his second Senate race in two election cycles on Tuesday, as Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen defeated him to win a second term, according to a CNN projection. Shaheen said late Tuesday night that Brown had called her to concede, and praised him for a ""vigorous race."" The race represented Republicans' best chances at picking up a Senate seat in the Northeast -- one that was vital for Democrats to protect as they faced majority-threatening challenges elsewhere. Over the summer, Brown used a series of crises to nationalize the race -- arguing that President Barack Obama and, by extension, Senate Democrats like Shaheen, are unable to govern effectively. He was among the first Republican candidates to call for a travel ban from Ebola-stricken countries in West Africa. He ran ads focused on ISIS and the border security, and focused much of his campaign on hitting Democrats over illegal immigration. Shaheen, meanwhile, turned to core Democratic economic issues and issues affecting working class voters and women. She hit Brown over what she argued were impossible-to-peg stances on lifting the minimum wage and mandating equal pay. She accused him of supporting GOP tax measures that promoted outsourcing while representing Massachusetts in the Senate. View the full results . And on issues like Ebola and ISIS, Shaheen repeatedly decked Brown for ""fear-mongering"" and ""grandstanding."" Perhaps most interesting, though, was that Brown was a candidate in New Hampshire at all. In 2010 he rocketed to national stardom among conservatives when he put thousands of miles on his truck in deep-blue Massachusetts, defeated Martha Coakley and grabbed deceased Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy's seat in a special election. But Brown lost that seat two years later, in a campaign against a much tougher Democratic opponent -- liberal icon Elizabeth Warren. A year later, after a trip to Iowa and a brief flirtation with the idea of running for president, Brown moved to his home state of New Hampshire and decided to take on Shaheen -- who Republicans viewed as vulnerable, but didn't have anyone with the star quality it'd take to beat her prior to Brown's arrival. Shaheen cast Brown as a political opportunist, while Brown emphasized his roots in a state that he left when his parents divorced. CNN's Magic Wall Midterm coverage .","Democratic Sen.

"(CNN) -- With talk about the 2016 election heating up, most of the national media has turned the focus on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vice President Joseph Biden. Clinton and Biden would be formidable candidates. Either would be a logical successor to President Barack Obama as the leader of the Democratic Party. Yet if they are to be successful, they will need to look outside the beltway to learn about the kinds of issues that are animating voters outside of Washington. They would do well to draw on some of the ideas that have been percolating in recent months from newer voices in the party. And at a time when politicians can suffer quick downfalls, as New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is learning, Democrats would do well to make sure that they have other potential candidates who can compete on the national stage, should Clinton or Biden fail to materialize as 2016 candidates. Inside Politics: Hillary Clinton's telling words about critics . Whoever runs, the future of the Democrats may lie in learning from two mayors, two governors and a gubernatorial candidate who are all building on the traditional Democratic theme of security -- a theme that has been central to the party since New Deal -- but trying to do so in new ways. Democrats have an exciting group of mayors who have been garnering enthusiasm for their efforts to tackle the big economic and social issues that Washington seems incapable of resolving. In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio has launched a full-scale attack on economic inequality. His campaign captured national attention when he spoke about the tale of two cities, one poor, struggling and devastated, and the other wealthy and thriving. De Blasio kicked off his time in office with ambitious proposals for affordable housing as well as prekindergarten education. He's already run into obstacles, including tensions with New York's Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who shot down his plan for a higher minimum wage. De Blasio has had to fend off complaints about snow removal and controversy over his call to a police official to ask about the arrest of a pastor, who has been one of his strong supporters. Still, the mayor has excited Democrats about the possibilities for the revitalization of urban liberalism. Donna Brazile: Enough already with the obsession over Hillary Clinton . San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro, who delivered the keynote address at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, has devoted energy to the challenges facing Latinos in his city. He has made an impassioned plea to treat immigration as a human rights issue, urging Congress to provide a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. He has also been addressing the issues that greatly concern working families, such as prekindergarten education and job creation. The mayor has been able to boast about its strong economic record in 2013, with growth in health care as well as oil and gas development, in addition to a thriving housing market. San Antonio is frequently placed in various Top 10 lists of thriving American cities. Democratic governors have also been making waves. In Maryland, one potential 2016 presidential candidate, Martin O'Malley, has been responding to social and cultural changes that have been transforming the nation in recent years. O'Malley has been one of the governors to preside over the legalization of medical marijuana and to oppose the death penalty. He championed economic and financial assistance to illegal immigrants, such as legislation that offers in-state tuition rates for universities. He has also been a staunch supporter of tougher gun control, something that the national parties have failed to achieve even in the aftermath of horrendous shooting incidents. Maryland has made some notable progress in education as well as in attracting innovative companies to the state. Gov. Cuomo in New York has tried to combine tough fiscal discipline with an ongoing commitment to the social safety net. Cuomo has demonstrated his willingness to question some political orthodoxies among Democrats. Early in his term, Cuomo took on public employee unions and got big concessions from them in his effort to limit spending and taxes. Like O'Malley, he has supported same-sex marriage legislation. Cuomo backed legislation that imposed higher taxes on wealthier New Yorkers earlier in his term, though he disagreed with de Blasio's push for further increases this year, when Cuomo is running for re-election. He, too, has obtained stricter gun controls at a time that the federal government seemed paralyzed on the issue . Another source of new ideas is Juliette Kayyem, a former assistant secretary of Homeland Security and former CNN contributor. She is seeking the Democratic nomination for Massachusetts governor against Martha Coakley. Kayyem is running a campaign centered on the need for government to help restore security to middle-class families. Kayyem is proposing ideas to promote the interests of working women, including efforts to eliminate the wage gap and to enable affordable childcare. She is tackling structural problems in the economy with ideas for improving public transportation and investing in community colleges. Building on her experience in government, she is also looking for better ways to provide physical security by dealing with vulnerable infrastructure that national policymakers have not done enough to protect. Democrats are building a sizable farm team in the states, filled with new voices and innovative ideas that will play a big role in the coming years: support for education, educational assistance to immigrants, job growth programs, child care, gun controls and more. Only of few of these candidates might be ready for the national spotlight --like O'Malley and maybe Cuomo -- but the others might have bright futures on the horizon. Given the gridlock in Washington, Clinton, Biden and anyone else running in 2016 would do well to look to the state and local level as they craft their agenda. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: If they run in 2016, Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden need new ideas .

"Washington (CNN) -- Republican Rep. Cory Gardner has won the race for Colorado's U.S. Senate seat, defeating incumbent Sen. Mark Udall, according to a CNN projection. The state, which voted for President Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, is a significant pickup for Republicans. This election cycle saw more than $100 million spent on TV ads for both candidates. Polling from recent weeks showed Gardner holding a slight lead against the incumbent senator, even though most fell within the margin of error. Udall spent much of the race trying to define Gardner as too conservative for Colorado. The one-term senator slammed Gardner repeatedly for co-sponsoring a ""personhood"" bill. Yet his effort to get women to turnout quickly backfired after Gardner softened his opposition to birth control restrictions. Udall's ""war on women"" strategy was one reason the Denver Post chose to endorse Gardner, just six years after they backed Udall. The newspaper's editorial board justified their endorsement noting that Udall ""devoted a shocking amount of energy and money"" on a campaign meant ""to frighten voters rather than inspire them.""

"(CNN) -- The U.S. experience with Ebola is generating commentary that is both prudent and outrageous. There have been three cases of Ebola occurring on U.S. soil, one ending fatally and the other two now under treatment. While health officials provide sober guidance on the deadly disease, several public figures, from high-level politicians to cultural icons, haven't been so even-tempered in their remarks, adding to the public hype that has become associated with the virus. Here is a sampling of those provocative comments, plus a little myth busting, clarifying and reality checking from Ebola experts from around the world. ""If you bring two doctors who happen to have that specialty (Ebola) into a room, one will say, 'No, it will never become airborne, but it could mutate so it would be harder to discover.' Another doctor will say, 'If it continues to mutate at the rate it's mutating, and we go from 20,000 infected to 100,000, the population might allow it to mutate and become airborne, and then it will be a serious problem.' I don't know who is right."" -- Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told CNN. Ebola isn't transmitted through the air. It is transmitted through direct contact by bodily fluids with an Ebola-infected person showing symptoms of the disease. A mutation such as the kind Dempsey describes ""would be exceedingly rare"" in one epidemic, said Edward C. Holmes of Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity at the University of Sydney. ""It happens over evolutionary time, millions of years,"" Holmes said. ""This idea that it takes one or two of those mutations and 'Wham!' you pick up airborne transmission, that is way too simplistic."" ""If someone has Ebola at a cocktail party, they're contagious and you can catch it from them. -- Sen. Rand Paul, a physician and potential 2016 presidential candidate . Again, experts say the contact with an infectious person must be tactile, or direct touching, and involve bodily fluids -- blood, sweat, feces, vomit, semen or spit. People in West Africa are avoiding hugs and handshakes because the virus can be spread through the sweat on someone's hand. The uninfected person would have to have a break in the skin of their hand that would allow entry of the virus, CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. But ""we all have minor breaks in our skin. And there is a possibility that some of the virus can be transmitted that way."" Paul also made other remarks regarding direct contact: ""They say all it takes is direct contact to get this. If you listen carefully, they say being three feet from someone is direct contact. That's not what most Americans think is direct contact."" Without directly addressing Paul's claims about contact over three feet, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Thomas Frieden indicated that's not a possible mode of transmission for the virus. ""Should you be worried you might have gotten it by sitting next to someone?"" Frieden said, according to the Louisville Courier-Journal. ""The answer to that is no."" ""The most comforting thing that I heard from (Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald, commissioner of the Georgia Department of Public Health) was that water kills the Ebola virus. I've never heard that before.

"(CNN) -- This is no treasure hunt for a casket of gold at the bottom of the ocean. Instead, it's like looking for a needle in a haystack, with this search potentially for no more than a few partly rotten timber frames on Newport Harbor's sea floor. For years, the whereabouts of one of the most famous ships in nautical history -- HMS Endeavour -- has remained a mystery. ""I don't like to call it treasure as there's no gold or silver,"" Dr Kathy Abbass, the executive director of Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project, a not-for-profit organization set up in 1992 set up to study the area's maritime history, told CNN. ""But it's an intellectual treasure."" The Endeavour is now believed to have been intentionally sunk -- in a new life and under a new name -- during the American Revolution in 1778. Endeavour is endemic to every Australian and New Zealand child's education with a rich British and American history to boot. It was the boat on which Captain James Cook achieved the first recorded contact with the east coast of Australia, Hawaii, and the first circumnavigation of New Zealand. Cook also provided the first accurate map of the Pacific and is believed to have shaped the world map more than any other explorer in history. So how exactly did the British Royal Navy vessel get from exploring undiscovered far flung lands to lying in waters off the east coast of the United States, sharing the ocean floor with torpedoes and other 18th Century vessels? A visit by Abbass to the Public Records' Office, now The National Archives, in London uncovered the fact that Endeavour had been sold into private hands and was known as the Lord Sandwich by the time of its demise. ""Lord Sandwich was the first lord of the admiralty at the time so the name makes sense -- a nod by its private owner,"" she says. ""We know from its size, dimension and these records that the Sandwich was the Endeavour."" In its new guise, it was used to house Patriot prisoners before it was one of 13 ships scuttled in a bid to stop a French invasion at Rhode Island. ""The American army was assembled on the mainland and the French sent a fleet to help,"" she continues. ""There's speculation that had the French fleet succeeded on that day, the revolution would have ended in Rhode Island rather than linger on for five more years. ""The British knew they were at great risk so they ordered 13 ships out to be scuttled in a line to blockade the city. They were sunk in fairly shallow waters. The French realized they couldn't get close to the city and had to stay away but they still cannoned the city."" It is a far cry from its previous existence, arriving in Botany Bay (part of the greater metropolis that is Sydney now) in 1770. It was a voyage on which it first came close to its demise by running aground on Australia's Great Barrier Reef, a section later renamed Endeavour Reef, which Cook navigated in the dark and from which he escaped by ditching weapons on board to lighten the load of the vessel. It is now believed to rest alongside 12 other vessels in a two-square-mile area where that conjoined scuttling took place eight years later. Nine of the ships have already been located -- the most recent just last month -- and there is every chance that Endeavour could already be among those nine, although reaching that conclusion is a slow and pain-staking process. Simple math would suggest there is a 70% chance Abbass and her team have already dived among the 300-tonne ship's ruins. In recent weeks, the quest has been picked up courtesy of a new partnership with Australian Maritime Museum, located in Sydney just a short boat ride from the Botany Bay that Cook first encountered. Head of research Dr Nigel Erskine is a maritime archaeologist whose Phd was on HMS Bounty and who has dived with regularity in Newport Harbor. In Australia, the countdown has begun to 2020 and the 250-year anniversary of Cook's arrival on Australian soil. Erskine admits that finding the ship, of which a replica has been made and was launched in 2012, would be a major fillip. ""I'm 60 years old and growing up there was a picture of Captain Cook and the Queen in most school rooms,"" he recalls. ""It's obviously a massive part of Australia's heritage."" However, finding Endeavour is no certainty. He adds: ""It's absolutely possible it might have been destroyed. Newport Harbour is very busy and there's 13 ships there, American and English. It's like an underwater jigsaw puzzle."" The search is done using a variety of methods such as sight sonar, which he likens ""to shining a torch on the ocean floor"", as well as GPS. Abbass is a realist too but is confident in the outcome. ""I don't know if we'll find all 13 but I think we have a good chance,"" she says. ""It may have been salvaged or destroyed when the harbor was dredged but we don't think that happened. We have a great chance of finding Endeavour."" Unlike her Australian counterparts, she is not solely obsessed with finding the one ship but with all of them, in her quest for greater maritime knowledge of American and British vessels at that time. If and when Endeavour is properly found, who does she belong to? All Royal Navy vessels still belong to Britain wherever they end up coming to rest. Privately owned vessels, however, like the Lord Sandwich, as she became known, are a different matter. And when uncovered she will belong to Rhode Island, although getting to that point was not without its concerns. ""There's no gold in the vessel so there wasn't an issue of treasure salvers,"" she explains. ""But with the history of Endeavour, there was a concern of someone trying to get to her. But a law is now in place that she belongs to Rhode Island although that doesn't mean we won't share her."" The waters in the harbor are murky and visibility, at best, is no more than six feet. That combined with the cost of equipment and man power -- with limited financial resources -- makes it a slow process. The state of preservation depends how much the timber frames of the vessels are under silt, which because of their lack of oxygen effectively preserve the wood. For Abbass, those murky waters have become her life's work. The search for that particular treasure goes on.","The search for Captain Cook's Endeavour centers on two square miles in Newport .

"(CNN) -- The situation in Syria would break the heart of anyone who has one. That is why progressives desperately want peace in Syria, an end to the chemical weapons attacks and aid for the millions of refugees. Additionally, most of us support President Barack Obama and want him to have a successful presidency. But we must be consistent. We have a worldview that requires the right thing to be done -- in the right way. That is why those of us who opposed President George W. Bush's war in Iraq have no choice but to oppose Obama's proposed attack on the Syrian regime. There are three reasons, at least. 1. In 2003, we condemned Bush and Secretary of State Colin Powell for relying on dodgy evidence of weapons of mass destruction while making the case for war before the United Nations. But at least Bush took his case to the United Nations. Obama has not formally presented any evidence to the United Nations -- at all. 2. We attacked Bush for conjuring up his own, personal ""coalition of the willing"" to launch a war. Bush's alliance was cobbled together largely out of a bunch of countries that many people in the United States had never heard of -- some of which were sending only a handful of troops. And yet Obama has virtually no coalition at all. Even the United Kingdom won't strike with us on this one. So Obama would be attacking with a smaller coalition than Bush had. 3. We condemned Bush's team because, even though our forces won the war, Bush had no plan to win the peace. Unfortunately, Obama seems to have no plan to win the war -- or the peace. He is just proposing ""limited, proportional strikes"" -- without explaining what happens next after Syria inevitably strikes back somehow. It is hard to get into a ""limited, proportional"" fistfight. There is no way to keep this war limited. The region is a powder keg with Lebanon's Hezbollah and Iran poised to retaliate for any strike against their ally Bashar al-Assad. Assad could drag Israel into the conflict if he struck that nation. Furthermore, the Assad regime has had weeks to fortify or hide prime targets, including his chemical weapons from attack by air. All of these may well mean, that despite Secretary of State John Kerry's protestations, we may have to engage in a land war and put ""boots on the grounds"" to achieve our military objectives. Mission creep and chaos are normal parts of war. Instead of jumping feet first into a war, we need to get creative. Two options short of war leap to mind. 1. Disrupt and deter without violence. Cyberwarfare has proven extremely effective containing Iran and disrupting its nuclear program through the Stuxnet virus U.S. intelligence agencies developed. A similar cyber campaign aimed at disabling the communications and weapons delivery systems of the Assad regime could ""degrade"" al-Assad's ability to attack innocent civilians just the same. 2. Give peace a chance. Obama has slowly built up a coalition of the reluctant. From Jordan to Germany, our allies are strongly opposed to al-Assad's acts but hesitate to endorse, let alone join, a U.S. military coalition to hit the Syrian leader. We all want an end to the civil war. Let's engage Russia, Iran and the Arab League and renew efforts for a conference to end the conflict. If the backers of the rebels and al-Assad's regime are shamed into a summit, the civil war may find a peaceful resolution. It may not work, but it's worth a try. The ongoing situation in Syria is a tragedy. The suspected use of chemical weapons against innocent civilians by the Assad regime is despicable and deserves our condemnation. But military strikes by the United States under these conditions won't make the situation better -- and could potentially make it much worse. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Van Jones.","Van Jones: Yes, we want peace in Syria and an end to chemical attacks .
But he says supporting a military strike on Syria would be to repeat mistakes from Iraq War .
Jones: Bush took his case to the U.N.; Obama has not presented evidence there .

"Orlando, Florida (CNN) -- A federal hearing began Monday to determine whether SeaWorld Orlando should be charged with a willful violation in the 2010 death of killer whale trainer Dawn Brancheau. As witnesses took the stand inside the Seminole County Courthouse in Sanford, Florida, members of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, or PETA, demonstrated outside. Monday was the first day of the hearing, which will resume at 9 a.m. Tuesday and is expected to continue all week. In February 2010, as park guests watched in horror, Brancheau, 40, was pulled into a SeaWorld pool and drowned by a 12,000-pound killer whale named Tilikum. Brancheau had been sitting on the Shamu Stadium's pool edge during a private show. After a lengthy investigation, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration -- the federal agency that works to prevent workplace injuries -- cited SeaWorld of Florida in August 2010 for willfully endangering employees by not taking proper safety precautions. ""SeaWorld recognized the inherent risk of allowing trainers to interact with potentially dangerous animals,"" Cindy Coe, OSHA's Atlanta regional administrator, said in a statement. ""Nonetheless, it required its employees to work within the pool wall, on ledges and on shelves where they were subject to dangerous behavior by the animals,"" she said. The citation said the park allowed its employees to work with Tilikum, a whale with ""known aggressive tendencies"" who was involved in the 1991 death of a trainer at a Vancouver, British Columbia, marine park. The theme park did not provide barriers, decking, oxygen supply systems or other types of protection for the trainers, OSHA said. SeaWorld spokeswoman Becca Bides disagreed, saying, ""These allegations are completely baseless, unsupported by any evidence or precedent, and reflect a fundamental lack of understanding of the safety requirements associated with marine mammal care."" SeaWorld contested OSHA's findings and is presenting evidence to the OSHA Review Committee, a separate government agency, at this week's hearing in Sanford, northeast of Orlando. OSHA Review Committee Administrative Judge Ken Welsch is presiding over the hearing, in which both sides are presenting evidence and witness testimony. In his opening remarks on Monday, OSHA attorney John Black said SeaWorld allowed their trainers to take a calculated risk by working with killer whales that have the potential to cause harm or death to those who get close. Trainers are required to sign a document that acknowledges that they have read the standard operating procedure manual and acknowledge the calculated risk. Black called the document a release waiver and argued that the park's training for the handlers was not enough. SeaWorld's attorney said the handlers' training is only one component, noting that the animals are trained, too. ""It goes hand in hand,"" said Carla J. Gunnin Stone. It's unclear if OSHA's attorneys will present surveillance video showing Brancheau's death. Her relatives have fought to keep it sealed. U.S. District Judge Gregory Presnell on Thursday denied the Brancheau family's request to keep the tape from being released or used at the hearing. ""We cannot comment on what may or may not be presented (during the hearing), as that depends not only on our own attorneys but also on any rulings issued by the judge in the case,"" OSHA spokesman Michael Wald said. Since the accident, SeaWorld has restricted all trainers from entering the water with killer whales until further notice, though Tilikum has returned in a theme park show called ""One Ocean.""","After death of killer whale trainer, OSHA said SeaWorld didn't take proper precautions .

"Washington (CNN) -- Voters who are fed up with endless gridlock might be disappointed if they expect a Senate now controlled by Republicans to change things. One congressional expert put it bluntly: ""The basic factors causing [gridlock] are not gone,"" said James Thurberfrom, a professor at American University. ""So it is likely that we will have a lot of delay and stalemate in the Senate."" The stark reality is Republicans don't have the 60 votes they need to overcome Democratic filibusters, making it hard to pass many of their priorities. But perhaps the biggest obstacle for Republicans -- the next election. Senate aides from both parties and outside congressional observers agree that political positioning for the upcoming 2016 presidential and congressional elections will likely dominate the day-to-day workings of the Senate, . While Republican leaders believe it is important they show the country they can pass legislation and govern effectively, Democrats will likely do everything they can to block GOP achievements because they think they have a good chance of winning back the chamber in 2016. In that cycle, Republicans need to defend 24 seats -- many from politically divided states -- while Democrats only have to defend 10, most of which are from blue states. ""Look, the Democrats see an opportunity to keep the White House in 2016 and pick up seats and get the majority back,"" said a GOP Senate aide predicting Democrats will refuse to work with them. Complicating matters for Republicans is an expected tug of war within their party, with potential 2016 presidential contenders trying to assert their conservative credentials while other GOP Senators in competitive states try to appeal to moderate voters. ""I think it's going to be a little bit more chaotic and disorderly,"" said Ramesh Ponnuru, of the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. In addition, it's unclear how President Barack Obama will respond to a Congress fully in Republican control, and whetherl he will make a genuine effort to cut hard-to-reach compromises or be more aloof, choosing to shore up his legacy over the last two years of his term by issuing executive orders on immigration and other priorities. Kentucky Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, currently the Senate minority leader, is set to take over the powerful top job in the Senate when the new Congress convenes in January. After complaining for years that the Democrats put politics ahead of a well-functioning Senate, McConnell has vowed to return to ""regular order"" so that budgets, spending bills, and other items are approved months before the threat of a government shutdown or fiscal cliff looms. But his longtime sparring partner, Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, is sure to challenge him on anything Democrats oppose. ""I think there will continue to be a battle between Reid and McConnell. They don't like each other,"" Thurber said. ""Reid will use delaying tactics as a minority leader, threatening filibusters. I don't think Republicans will have 60 votes so they can't overcome that."" The particular dynamics of the Republican conference make it even more difficult for McConnell to manage the Senate. On one side of his conference he has three tea party senators -- Rand Paul of Kentucky, Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas -- who may seek the GOP nomination for president and who will be reluctant to cut deals with Democrats as they work to attract conservative primary voters. On the other side are a dozen or more senators who will be up for re-election in purple and blue states -- such as Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mark Kirk of Illinois -- who may want work across the aisle to show the broad base of voters in their states that they helped cut through the DC gridlock. ""I think he will be constantly maneuvering and using duct tape and glue to keep his conference together,"" Ponnuru said of McConnell. In fact, Cruz has already proposed a ten-step plan he'd like Republicans to follow next year. He argued, in a recent USA Today column, his plan would prove to voters Republican senators take seriously their desire to change Washington. His ideas include implementing tax reform, passing a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, reforming federal education policies, auditing the Federal Reserve, and repealing or reforming Obamacare. One of Republicans' top priorities will be to rework parts of Obamacare, with the recognition they won't be able to repeal the law in its entirety because of President Obama's veto authority. But they at least want to make changes to the individual and employer mandates, get rid of the medical device tax, and pass other reforms. ""I think it's more likely we'll have a step-by-step approach to dismantling it and replacing it with consumer oriented, more cost-effective health care that won't interfere with the doctor/patient relationship,"" said Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the second-ranking Republican senator. ""That's what the American people want and that's what our goal is to provide."" Another major concern among Republicans is Obama's plan to use his executive authority to change immigration laws, something he may announce shortly after the election. Republicans hope to be in a stronger position to push back on those changes now that they will control both the House and Senate. Republicans also want to pass several energy bills, including approval of the Keystone XL pipeline. And they and want to push through a variety of job creation bills that passed in the GOP-controlled House last Congress but that were never taken up by Senate Democrats. Bipartisan support is possible on pending trade bills supported by the White House. One of the biggest changes to Capitol life that McConnell says he will institute is to have the Senate work an actual five day work week. Under Reid, the Senate typically was in session only four days a week, with truncated schedules on Monday and Thursday. But doing so well test McConnell's ability as leader because members of both parties -- most of who travel back and forth to their states each weekend to be with their families and constituents -- have enjoyed the luxury of the shortened Senate week.","Mitch McConnell is set to lead the Republican senate and vowed to restore 'regular order'
However factors like the 2016 elections may give Democrats incentive to block GOP efforts .
One question will be how the GOP decides to address Obama's health care law .
Another issue is immigration though chances look slim for sweeping legislation ."

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The actor who gave voice to Pinocchio in Walt Disney's 1940 animation movie, died at his home Monday night, the Los Angeles County coroner's office said Tuesday. Richard Percy Jones, known in film and television as Dick Jones, was 87. The cause of death has not yet been determined, according to Fred Corral of the coroner's office. A daughter found Jones on a bathroom floor of his Northridge, California, home, Corral said. Disney Studios named Jones a ""Disney Legend"" in 2000 in recognition of his work on the iconic film. ""At the time, 'Pinocchio' was just a job,"" Jones said at the time of induction. ""Who knew it would turn out to be the classic that it is today? I count my lucky stars that I had a part in it."" In addition to voicing the script, Jones also wore a puppet costume and acted out scenes to help Disney animators draw the cartoon. Born in McKinney, Texas, on February 25, 1927, his acting career started when he was just 3 years old. Cowboy film legend Hoot Gibson discovered the child while appearing in a rodeo in Jones' hometown, according to his Disney biography. ""Hoot told my mother I ought to be in pictures and sponsored our trip to Hollywood,"" Jones said. Jones acted in Jimmy Stewart's ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" and ""Destry Rides Again"" during the same 19 months he was working on Pinocchio, according to his bio. He was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1944, but returned to Hollywood after the second world war. Jones acted in Errol Flynn's ""Rocky Mountain"" and several other movies before the start of his television acting career in 1949. He used his skills as a horseman to work as a stuntman for Gene Autry's Flying A Productions. Jones played the sidekick in ""The Range Rider"" television series before getting his own western series, ""Buffalo Bill, Jr."" in the 1950s. His 200 TV appearances include guest star roles in ""Gunsmoke,"" ""Annie Oakley"" and ""The Lone Ranger."" When he left acting to start a career in real estate in 1959, he had appeared in nearly 100 movies, according to Disney.

"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- Last month's deadly fire at a clothing factory on the outskirts of Bangladesh's capital was an ""act of sabotage,"" a government committee of inquiry said Monday. The panel also said the owner of the factory should be held responsible for gross negligence of safety and should face trial for the lack of safety measures that led to 112 deaths. Most of the dead in the fire at the Tazreen Fashion factory in Ashulia last month were women. Almost half of the dead were burned beyond recognition and were buried under government supervision after DNA samples were taken. More than 200 people also were injured in the blaze. ""We're sure it was an act of sabotage, but it needs further investigation by an intelligence or police agency to ascertain who was behind this act of sabotage,"" said the head of the government committee, Main Uddin Khandaker, an additional secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs. ""The owner of the factory should be brought to justice, as we find that proper safety measures could have lessened the fatalities,"" he said after submitting the report to the home secretary. Factory owner Delwar Hossain could not be reached for comment Monday. He earlier admitted to local media that his factory lacked proper safety measures, but said he had not been aware of it. A couple of days after the November 24 fire, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina also called it a ""planned arson."" Police have arrested three mid-level managers and sent them to jail for not allowing the workers to leave the building after the fire alarm went off. They told them ""it was for a mock fire drill,"" officials said. The committee in its report recommended that the owner and at least nine other mid-level managers should be prosecuted under the Bangladesh Penal Code. The committee also recommended that the government form a ""powerful task force"" to ensure safety at garment factories and other facilities across the country. Ready-made garments make up 80% of Bangladesh's $24 billion in annual exports. The country has about 4,500 garment factories that make clothes for stores such as Tesco, Walmart, Teddy Smith, J.C. Penney, H&M, Marks & Spencer, Kohl's and Carrefour. The sector earned $19 billion last year.","Panel: Further investigation is needed to pin down who started a clothing factory fire .

"Cairo (CNN) -- A few days before the runoff elections that brought the Muslim Brotherhood candidate to the presidency, I was invited along with other civil activists to meet Mohamed Morsi. He did not show up, but his top advisers were present. After the long speech they gave about how Morsi will empower the civil society and that the Muslim Brotherhood will respect human rights including women's rights, a colleague of mine raised his hand to ask a question. ""I saw in your booklet that you respect human rights and women rights according to Sharia,"" my colleague asked. ""Is it different from the rights mentioned in the international conventions that Egypt has signed?"" The answer given by one of the leader of Morsi's campaign was shocking. ""Sharia values women more than the international conventions,"" the Morsi adviser said. ""Do you know that according to Sharia the woman may choose not to breastfeed her child or clean the house until her husband pays her for doing this?"" he added confidently, to much laughter in the room. This simple conversation, more than anything, sums up how the Muslim Brotherhood views women's rights and what the status of women is likely to be under its rule. For while it may use the same terminology that we do, its perception of what those terms mean is completely different to that of liberal activists like me. They cannot see a woman outside the biological stereotypes as a mother, child-bearer, and housewife. On the other side, activists like myself are working to establish women rights and gender equality in social, political, and civic spheres. Actually, they always describe ""women's rights"" as a western value and used to call it ""women's issues."" The space provided for women on the Brotherhood's Ikhwan website, for instance, is called ""family oasis"" and is full of stories about bringing up children, making your husband happy, the proper dress for the woman, and such topics that views women's role exclusively within the family. The Muslim Brotherhood in fact has a shameful record of marginalizing women in the group, until it needs to abuse them to beautify the group's image. All through its history, the Muslim Sisters have never been allowed access to the leadership office of the Muslim Brotherhood group. The Muslim Brothers have changed this only in the past year by establishing the Freedom and Justice political party. It hired some women in the supreme committee of the party, but they are the wives, daughters, or relatives of leading brothers. We do not know much about them and they rarely -- if ever -- appear in public to speak on behalf of their party. Although the Muslim Brotherhood allows women to run for parliamentary elections, they put them at the bottom of the ticket or support them with weak campaigns. The women chosen are merely the wives of the leaders, regardless of their skills or qualifications. Thus, their chances to win are limited. This makes the group appear to be respecting women rights; in reality it is doing the opposite. Regardless of the fact that Muslim Brotherhood declared in 2007 that they may never allow Egyptian ""women or Coptic Christians"" in decision-making positions, they did not hesitate to exploit women to appear more moderate than other Islamist groups and appeal more to the political scene. In 2005 parliamentary elections, they put three women among the 133 candidates on their parliamentary election campaign platform. These women were the wives of prominent members in the group. They were politically weak and generally unpopular. One of them was Makarem Eldiary, who included many items in her political agenda that were clearly discriminatory towards women. Her equivalent in the post-revolution parliament is Azza Al-Garf who has been lobbying against the 2003 legislation that criminalizes the savage practice of female genital mutilation. A few weeks after her statements, the Muslim Brothers' Freedom and Justice Party launched a medical convoy that roamed Upper Egyptian cities looking to circumcize girls. The Muslim Brotherhood cannot be solely blamed for the marginalization of Egytian women, whose rights are almost grinding between two large stones. The first is the patriarchal mind-set that traps women in stereotypical female roles and stigmatizes any woman who tries to break out of this mold. The second is the rise of political Islamists who encourage this patriarchal mentality and are wrongly interpreting religion to justify the social and political marginalization of women in the name of Islam. One month after the revolution, we had a referendum on the constitutional amendments. Massive number of Egyptians motivated by their hunger for democracy participated in the poll. As a woman rights activist, I seized the opportunity to test people's willingness to include women in their vision of democracy. I ran a survey about whether ""it is good for Egypt to have a woman president"" outside polling stations in three areas Nasr City, Shubra, and Downtown. With the help of two interns, we surveyed 1453 people, including 634 women. The answer for my survey question was ""100% no."" Ironically, most of the words that followed this extreme ""no"" was loaded with much hatred and derision toward women. Despite the impressive role of women in the revolution, most Egyptians still believe that women are made for kitchen not for office. I do not know Morsi to pre-judge how women will be treated under his rule. Yet, I know the history of the Muslim Brothers that our new president came from. I know that they show respect to women rights only to hunt a political gain and then go back to mistreating them. If this happened this time, they will not be abusing the group's women, they will be abusing Egypt's women. I hope and pray every day that Morsi will prove me wrong and does his best -- despite the Muslim Brotherhood attitude toward women -- to empower Egypt through empowering its women in their non-biological roles. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dahlia Ziada.","Egyptian activist says Muslim Brotherhood views women only in terms of role as mother and housewife .

"Beijing (CNN) -- China has suspended approvals of nuclear plants so safety standards can be revised while Japan grapples with its nuclear crisis, Chinese state-run media reported Wednesday. Safety standards will be revised in China following the explosions and fires at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi plant in the wake of a 9.0-magnitude quake and resulting tsunami, Xinhua reported. The decision was made at a Chinese cabinet meeting Wednesday, the news agency reported. The state council, or cabinet, ""has required relevant departments to do safety checks at existing plants, according to a statement released after the meeting, which was presided over by Premier Wen Jiabao,"" the report said. Reactors at China's six nuclear power plants already in operation are safe, the report said. But, ""Before the revised safety standards are approved, all new nuclear power plants, including pre-construction works, should be suspended, according to the statement.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Sen. Kay Hagan is punching back at her opponent after getting slammed by Republicans this week over missing a classified briefing on ISIS and other security threats to attend a fundraiser. In a TV ad released first to CNN on Friday, the North Carolina Democrat rebukes GOP attacks, plays up her voting attendance record on the Armed Services Committee and slams her rival North Carolina House Speaker Thom Tillis as a ""hypocrite."" Hagan admitted earlier this week that she missed an Armed Services Committee meeting to attend a fundraiser. What she didn't tell reporters in that post-debate press conference was that the meeting was in fact a classified briefing on ISIS and other national security threats with the Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. The revelation has given Republicans fresh fodder to slam Hagan's already shaky attendance record at Armed Services Committee hearings, but Hagan's campaign is looking to spotlight Tillis' own irregular attendance record. Hagan's ad spotlights Tillis' record of missing legislative work in favor of fundraising, which even prompted his hometown paper to call for Tillis' resignation -- a clip featured in the latest Hagan ad. The ad also claims Tillis has ""no military plan to take out ISIS"" and plays up Hagan's 98% voting attendance record and says she ""leads hearings on eradicating terrorists like ISIS."" Hagan's TV spot was released the same day the Karl Rove-tied Crossroads GPS pushed an ad  playing back Hagan's post-debate statement. ""You know, there was one,"" Hagan told reporters on Tuesday. ""And what had happened at that hearing, it was scheduled early in the day, and then votes were scheduled, and then that hearing had to be postponed later that day. So yes, I did miss that one."" That statement rolls uncut for 14 seconds in the 30-second sport after viewers are led in with footage of masked gun-wielding ISIS militants while a narrator talks about ISIS's ""mass murder"" campaign, threats of terrorism on U.S. soil and beheading of Americans. ""Hagan skipped the hearing for a fundraiser,"" the ad closes. And when confronted with his own voting record, Tillis deflected a question about his habit of putting cash campaigning before his State legislature duties. ""Quite honestly, if I had anything approaching the seriousness of the threat of ISIS, I would have canceled anything I was doing."" ""There is nothing more important than receiving briefings on our national security,"" Tillis told reporters on a conference call Wednesday. ""It's the top responsibility of every Member of Congress. Senator Hagan has failed to do her job. What is her excuse for not showing up to work over half the time?"" The Democratic senator's campaign had earlier confirmed that Hagan attended less than half of the committee's 49 public hearings in the last two years, but that none of those absences were tied to fundraisers. Faced with questions Wednesday about why it hadn't revealed that a fundraiser trumped a hearing, the campaign insisted it hadn't been not forthcoming because that list of missed hearings didn't include closed-door briefings -- like the one she missed Feb. 27 to attend a New York fundraiser. Republicans immediately pounced on the report that Hagan missed a crucial briefing on the ISIS threat, an issue that now has the potential to swing the already neck and neck race in Tillis's favor. Polling over the last week has shown Hagan maintaining a razor-thin two- to four-point lead over her challenger. DSCC ad: Tillis in Koch brothers' pocket . Charges that incumbents have missed hearings, briefings, votes, and other official work are popping up in a several closely-fought Senate races this year. And in the Republican-leaning Tar Heel state, which boasts a large military population, Tillis is betting Hagan's absences from a national security hearings and at least one intelligence briefing will hurt the first-term senator. Democratic campaign operatives in Washington, who are already battling headwinds in their effort to keep the Senate in Democratic control, conducted private polling on the question so they could fully understand its impact. The results showed the issue is very potent and could damage even seasoned candidates.

"(CNN) -- Friday's White House meeting with congressional leaders is a timid first step by President Obama toward learning to work effectively with a Congress that will now be controlled by Republicans. It will not be easy, judging from President Obama's and Sen. Mitch McConnell's post-election press conferences on Wednesday. Obama and McConnell both talked about cooperation. But both also were very confrontational about the possibility of the President issuing executive orders on immigration (McConnell appropriately so given the lawless and unprecedented nature of what the President is contemplating). President Obama's press conference was almost two different events. One was conciliatory and suggested to the voters, ""I hear you."" The other was confrontational and almost hostile, asserting that he will do what he wants through executive action unless Republicans give him exactly what he wants through legislation. Friday's meeting is too large and too pro-forma to advance the ball much on building an effective working relationship or addressing immigration. It will almost certainly be largely a dog and pony show. In the days that follow, however, President Obama faces an important strategic choice between two paths forward, one productive, the other destructive. The first option, the path toward a productive working relationship, is clear. House Speaker John Boehner and presumptive Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have each laid down markers for how a productive way forward can take place. To start, Boehner outlined five areas of reform in an important speech at the American Enterprise Institute in September. President Obama should be looking at those five areas for opportunities to work together. Boehner and McConnell published a very clear call for reform on Thursday and listed several areas that could be the basis for working together. In January 2014, McConnell gave a very important speech on the floor of the U.S. Senate about reversing Harry Reid's tight control and returning the Senate to its role as a true deliberative body. He was immediately followed by Sen. Lamar Alexander calling on the Senate to restore the manner in which former Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield, a Democrat, ran the institution -- a model of a collegial, committee-led deliberative body. (The fact that both McConnell and Alexander were young staffers when Mansfield was majority leader is an important factor in understanding how the new Republican majority will operate.) The commitment McConnell expressed in that speech to a committee-centered, collegial Senate offers President Obama and Senate Democrats the opportunity to work together in a productive way that Sen. Harry Reid denied to Senate Republicans for the last eight years. With the foundation laid by Boehner and McConnell, what will then be needed are systematic and serious steps toward finding ways to work together. The most important step toward working together -- is to work together. President Eisenhower had breakfast regularly with House Speaker Sam Rayburn and Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson after the Republicans were routed in the 1958 election. The three of them got a lot done in Eisenhower's last two years in office. There is no substitute for President Obama meeting regularly, preferably weekly, with Boehner and McConnell. These meetings should be private, off-the-record and each principal should bring only one staff person. The three leaders should start by focusing on small, confidence-building measures and avoid the big fights in the short term. They have to build a rhythm of achievement and mutual trust for anything to work. This can be difficult, largely because of two things the myopic, politics-obsessed coterie of analysts, consultants and staff fails to understand. The first is that history often intrudes on their plans and demands an effective government. Ebola is real. ISIS is real. Putin is real. There are many things national leaders have to deal with because history won't wait. This requires leaders to compartmentalize their thinking and their emotions. President Clinton and I were able to work on international financial crises, national security issues and other pressing topics no matter what political fights we were in. The new governing trio will need the same capacity to cooperate on some matters despite conflict on others. Second, the legislative season for the new Congress runs through the summer of 2016. The Washington mantra that there are only a few months of substance before the presidential campaign and politics overwhelms it is just baloney. We passed and President Clinton signed welfare reform in August 1996 in the middle of the presidential campaign. President Obama and congressional leaders can take a bit of time to build an effective working relationship. If they can start small and build while ignoring (temporarily at least) the stories of the day, the President and the new Congress have a strong chance of finding ways to work together. If, however, President Obama takes the other path before him--pursuing the vision of an unrestrained executive he sketched in his press conference--he is likely to have a very difficult time collaborating with Congress on anything. It will be hard for congressional leadership to work effectively with a President who brazenly disregards the constitutional powers of the legislative branch, as the actions he reportedly is contemplating apparently would. Even if the Republican leadership wants to push forward on areas other than immigration, actions as destructive as the President suggests he will undertake will poison the atmosphere with much of the nation and their representatives on Capitol Hill. Such an outcome also means the country will have that much harder a time facing national and international crises. The responsibility for such a destructive atmosphere and relationship with Congress will be the President's alone. If President Obama wants to have the effective working relationship with Congress that he says he does, he will have to take the path that can lead to such a relationship. It is wide open. The other path is a path to national pain and division. The choice is his. A lot depends on the next few weeks. It will be fascinating to watch.

"Irvine, California (CNN) -- It wasn't until Yash Gupta broke his glasses in taekwondo practice that he realized just how much he relied on them. His prescription was so high that he had to wait a week to get a new pair. For Gupta, then a high school freshman, those seven days were a blur. Literally. ""I just couldn't see anything,"" said Gupta, now 17. ""I couldn't see in the classroom; I would get easily distracted. ... Just basic stuff I used to do every day, I couldn't do."" Gupta's eyes were also opened to a much larger problem. He saw on the Internet that more than 12 million children worldwide don't have the corrective eyewear they need (PDF). ""It's just a total disadvantage for them, because (if) you can't see anything ... you definitely can't make the most of the education you're being given,"" he said. ""It would be impossible for them to fully achieve their potential. ""I had this problem for one week, but these kids have these problems for their whole lives."" So at just 14, Gupta started Sight Learning, an organization that collects used eyeglasses from optometrists and donates them to organizations that can deliver them to children in need. Since 2011, Gupta has donated 9,500 pairs of glasses, worth nearly $500,000, to young people in Haiti, Honduras, India and Mexico. For Gupta, who has worn glasses since he was 5 years old, the idea of repurposing old eyewear made sense. Most of his family members wear glasses, and just searching his own home yielded instant results. ""I found 10 to 15 pairs just lying around the house in random drawers,"" Gupta said. He realized those glasses alone could help 10 or 15 children. So, with help from his father, Gupta set up his organization and approached local optometrists, who agreed to put out drop boxes where patients could donate their used eyeglasses after getting a new pair. ""That first interaction was really promising for me,"" he said. ""Some of (the optometrists) already had pairs of glasses that they had just accumulated over the years that they didn't know what to do with."" In the past three years, Gupta has gone on numerous trips to India and Mexico, where he not only provides glasses but also assists the doctors and volunteers at eye clinics. Those who work with him see his age as an asset. ""He works hard and has great initiative, but more importantly, he brings such great energy -- and that sets the tone for everyone,"" said Dr. Greg Pearl, president of the California chapter of Volunteer Optometric Services to Humanity. Gupta says that being in the field is the best part of his work. ""That dazed look the first time (children) get glasses, and just seeing that turn into joy and happiness ... it's just really inspiring,"" he said. Gupta knows that the glasses he's providing can make a big impact. ""A lot of times, these families are in poverty,"" he said. ""With a good education, you know, they can get a good job and get a good career."" Helping others motivates Gupta, whose family immigrated to the United States from India when he was just 1 year old. ""We had a really tough time adapting,"" Gupta recalled. ""I (am) sympathetic to people who (are) struggling."" Gupta, a senior in high school, helps fund his work by tutoring younger students after school, and he spends about 20 hours a week collecting and shipping the glasses. He plans to continue when he gets to college, and he has his eye on expanding into new territory. ""Right now, we're partnered with organizations that do international work. But in the future, I'd like to bring this service to inner cities in the U.S.,"" he said. Gupta has gotten a lot of attention for his work, including being honored at a White House event in July. But he says other people his age are also finding ways to give back. ""I think there's a misconception with our generation,"" he said. ""Many of my friends are doing things to improve their communities. ""Kids are passionate and can make a difference. It's just a matter of finding out what you care about and focusing on that.""

"(CNN) -- Henning Frunder was only 21 years old in 1968 when he decided he wanted to leave Eastern Germany. Polish fishermen were meant to take him and a group of students across the sea to the Northern border of West Germany, but the group never made it on that boat. Letters to friends in the West asking for money to pay for the journey ended up in the hands of East Germany's secret police, the Stasi. A few weeks later, Frunder and his friends were arrested, put on trial, and sent to jail for trying to illegally leave East Germany. Frunder spent months in a Stasi prison before eventually being deported to Western Germany in the fall of 1970. At that time he had no idea who sold him and his friends out. ""We were not trained in conspiracy. Maybe we trusted more people than we should have with our plans,"" he says. What Frunder knew was that it must have been someone that they trusted, someone who pretended to be a friend. For over 40 years Eastern Germany's Ministry of State Security, known as the Stasi, spied on its citizens, often using so-called ""informal employees"" -- secrets informants -- to report on their own colleagues, friends and family. When the Berlin Wall fell in November 1989, Stasi agents were given the order to cover their tracks and destroy any evidence that would reveal names of secret informants, documentation of dealings with the West, protocols and recordings of trial proceedings -- none of it was ever meant to be seen by the public. Activists were able to stop the destruction when they occupied the Stasi headquarters in January 1990. Over 45 Million pages of Stasi files had been torn apart and what the shredder could not handle had been simply torn apart by hand. Over 15,000 bags containing more 600 million pieces of paper were recovered. In 1992, two years after the German reunification, the Agency for the Federal Commission for the Stasi Records (BStU) was put in place. Its task: Solve one of history's biggest puzzles. Roland Jahn is the Federal Commissioner in charge of the Stasi Records Agency. Jahn is an ex-Stasi prisoner himself. He says the agency is doing an important job in dealing with the past. ""It is incredibly important for those concerned to gain access to their files, people get a part of their lives back that was stolen from them"", stresses Jahn. He adds that the agency providing access to secret police files is unique and serves as an international role model. So far 1.5 million pieces have been put back together, most of them by hand. Currently about a dozen employees are still manually trying to reconstruct the files. With 600 million pieces left, continuing the task by hand seems almost impossible. ""It is important that we develop systems to speed up the process"", says Jahn. In 2007 a computer system was introduced to accelerate the process. According to the Stasi Records Agency, the new virtual puzzle system has helped piece back together four bags so far. To tackle the remaining 15,000 bags a ""better scanner technology has to be developed and put in place,"" says Jahn. Decades after being sold out, Henning Frunder had thought he moved on. He didn't think he would ever find out who denounced him. ""Over time I stopped wondering, I thought it would not change much"", he recalls. In 1994 he received first clues about who his betrayer might have been, but it was not until 2011, over five decades later, that Frunder received a call from the Stasi Records Agency. ""Out of 15,000 bags they came across one that had my name in it,"" he remembers. It was the file of secret informant Aleksander Radler, a member of Frunder's student group. Radler, nicknamed ""Thomas,"" spied for the Stasi for over 25 years. ""When I learned that Radler was living in Sweden, preaching the word of God as a priest, this is when the outrage came,"" Frundler continues. But Frunder never contacted the former spy. ""He never showed any remorse, if he did, it might be interesting to talk to him."" Even though the recovery brought back old memories that Frunder thought to had been consigned to the past, he still believes it is in the interest of society to reconstruct the Stasi files. ""Looking back at my own story, I think I was able to deal with it, because I was so young, I hadn't built much they could take away from me. But he adds that ""others suffered more than we did and I am sure that there are many people out there that have big blanks to fill, and recovering the Stasi files could help bridging these gaps in the ordeal they went through."" Stasi Records Agency Commissioner Roland Jahn sees the confrontation with the past as vital for the future. ""If you chose to live with a lie you damage our democracy. That's why it is important to uncover the truth, even if it hurts"", he says. Today, every citizen has the right to request access to their files at the Stasi Records Agency either online or in person. In over two decades more than three million requests for files have been made, with more than 30,000 applications in 2014 alone. If and when the remaining 600 million pieces of Stasi files will be puzzled back together, Jahn cannot tell. It will depend on available funds, public and political interest and technology. However, Jahn is proud of what has been accomplished in the last 25 years. ""Germany has shown how to consistently face the past and deal with it, and being observed by the international community, it has created something that is of great importance today.""","Henning Frunder was jailed in East Germany after his plans to leave came to attention of Stasi .

"(CNN) -- It might not be the term that Republican Party leaders prefer, but Sen. Rand Paul had a choice word about the GOP's brand: It ""sucks."" While in Michigan on Wednesday spreading his message about building a more inclusive party, Paul -- as he has many times before --acknowledged that Republicans need to collectively improve their image. ""Remember Domino's Pizza? They admitted, 'Hey, our pizza crust sucks.' The Republican Party brand sucks and so people don't want to be a Republican and for 80 years, African-Americans have had nothing to do with Republicans,"" the Kentucky Republican said, according to The Hill. His comments came in remarks at a GOP field office in a predominantly black neighborhood in Detroit. The Domino's analogy is a staple in his speeches about broadening the party's appeal, but he hasn't been quite as candid in his use of language. Earlier this month, Paul told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that ""the biggest mistake"" Republicans have made in the past several decades is not aggressively courting African-American votes. It's a message he's been carrying for the past year as he lays the groundwork for a likely presidential campaign. He told Politico recently he thinks Republicans can win a third or more of the African-American vote in 2016 if the party embraces his method of advocating for education and criminal justice reform among other efforts to address poverty and unemployment. ""We're also fighting 40 years of us doing a crappy job, of Republicans not trying at all for 40 years, so it's a lot of overcoming,"" he said Wednesday. ""You got to show up, you got to have something to say and really we just have to emphasize that we're trying to do something different."" Following Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential loss, in which he carried only 6% of the black vote, the Republican National Committee has also attempted to retool its outreach by opening up multiple offices in urban areas and hiring more staff specifically tasked with targeting African-American voters.","Rand Paul says the Republican Party's brand ""sucks""

"(CNN) -- In Louisiana, Republican Bill Cassidy is running to retire Democratic incumbent Mary Landrieu. But national Democrats are hoping the GOP lawmaker's stance on raising the Social Security retirement age will stop that from happening. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee will unveil a new television ad in the Bayou State on Thursday that hammers Cassidy for favoring increasing the age at which retirees can collect Social Security benefits to 70. At Tuesday's debate, Cassidy said he did not support changing benefits for those at or near retirement, but suggested that benefits for younger workers would need to be revamped. Landrieu drew a sharp contrast with Cassidy at that meeting, saying the idea of having people work until they are 70 was ""very bad policy."" The DSCC is reinforcing that message with its latest ad in the hotly-watched race, one of the key battlegrounds for majority control of the Senate this fall. ""When it comes to seniors, Congressman Bill Cassidy has a plan: Raise the retirement age for Social Security and Medicare to 70,"" the narrator grimly states. The 30-second spot is part of a $2.5 million buy and is running statewide. Landrieu's campaign on Thursday unveiled a new website, 70WillHurt.com, to highlight Cassidy's stance on Social Security. The Cassidy campaign, meanwhile, accused Landrieu of trying to ""have it both ways"" when it comes to Social Security, pointing out that the Democrat previously expressed support for the Simpson-Bowles deficit reduction report that would have gradually raised the retirement age. A CNN/ORC survey released last month found Landrieu leading Cassidy 43 percent to 40 percent among likely voters, with the other Republican candidate in the race, Rob Maness, pulling nine percent. With no primary, all the contenders for the Senate seat will be on the ballot this fall. If no candidate receives a majority of the vote on Election Day the top two finishers will advance to a December runoff. In a head-to-head matchup, Cassidy leads Landrieu 50 percent to 47 percent among likely voters.","National Democrats unveil new TV ad in Louisiana on Thursday.

"(CNN) -- Looking for towering snow-covered peaks, lush woodlands, fields of rainbow-colored wildflowers or raging whitewater rivers across the United States? Thanks to the landmark Wilderness Act, celebrating its 50th anniversary on September 3, you can find many such examples of nature's splendor. The act preserved nearly 110 million acres of wilderness across the United States. Some 54 areas in 13 states were placed into the National Wilderness Preservation System immediately after its establishment in 1964. Now the act protects 758 areas in 44 states and Puerto Rico. In the spirit of celebration, here are 10 of the 54 original tracts of unspoiled wilderness celebrating 50 years of protection. With the exception of the impact of the forces of nature, they're preserved just as they were in 1964. Hiking, camping, backpacking and fishing are allowed in designated wilderness areas, as long as visitors follow a few rules designed to preserve the environment. 50 states, 50 spots: Natural wonders . Ansel Adams Wilderness, California . The Ansel Adams Wilderness Area spans more than 230,000 acres and nearly 350 miles of trails, including sections of the well-known John Muir and Pacific Crest trails. Hikers can traverse elevations climbing up to 14,000 feet. It was originally called the Minaret Wilderness because of the jagged peaks known as minarets in the Ritter Mountain Range, a sub-range of the Sierra Nevada. In 1984, the area was enlarged and renamed to honor legendary landscape photographer Ansel Adams. Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness, Colorado . Designated in 1964, Colorado's Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness now encompasses more than 180,000 acres. With 100 miles of trails and nine passes with elevations above 12,000 feet, the area is dotted with sparkling alpine lakes. Six of the area's peaks rise above 14,000 feet, drawing climbers to some of the most difficult ascents in Colorado. The imposing Maroon Bells peaks are said to be the most photographed peaks in North America. The mountains' reflection in Maroon Lake on a nice day is certainly picture-perfect. The area is easily accessible in the summer from Aspen via shuttle. Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness, Idaho and Montana . The third largest wilderness area in the lower 48 states, the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness is primarily in Idaho, but some of its 1.3 million acres spill over its glacier-carved border into Montana. With 1,800 miles of trails, the wilderness is a hiker's delight, although many of the trails are unmaintained. Traversing the rocky trails can be a challenge, but the chance to spot wildlife such as elk, deer, moose, black bears, mountain lions and wolves makes the effort worthwhile. Boundary Waters Canoe Wilderness, Minnesota . Sharing its northern border with Canada's Quetico Provincial Park, Minnesota's Boundary Waters Canoe Wilderness is comprised of more than 812,000 acres of preserved land, with nearly 1,200 lakes, ranging in size from 10 to 10,000 acres, and hundreds of miles of streams. The large network of streams allows for long-distance travel by watercraft, which is rare in the United States. Activities are plentiful in Boundary Waters, with camping and canoeing during the spring and summer, and skiing, dog-sledding and ice-fishing in the winter. The wilderness area also has cultural resource sites for visitors to explore the settlements and lives of Native Americans who settled on the land over 10,000 years ago. Gates of the Mountains Wilderness, Montana . At about 28,500 acres, Gates of the Mountains Wilderness in Helena, Montana, is one of the most well-known landmarks of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Although the sons of a French explorer traveled through the area in the 1700s, it was Meriwether Lewis who arrived in 1805 and gave the area its current name. Lewis was the first to leave a record of his passage through the area, giving it the moniker Gates of the Mountains in his journal. With 53 miles of trails in Gates of the Mountains, there are plenty of routes for visitors to enjoy. Shining Rock Wilderness, North Carolina . Shining Rock Wilderness in East Fork, North Carolina spans just over 18,000 acres, but it is the largest wilderness area in the state. Named for its bedrock, formed by the ""shining rock"" mica, the area has an elevation of 5,000 feet, with three peaks within the wilderness standing higher than 6,000 feet. Shining Rock is separated from another one of North Carolina's wilderness areas, Middle Prong, by a single road. Steep and rugged terrain makes for trails that are largely rated difficult. The Art Loeb (11.6 miles) and Shining Creek (3.4 miles) trails are very popular with hikers up for the challenge. Great Gulf Wilderness, New Hampshire . The smallest site on our list with just over 5,600 acres, Great Gulf Wilderness, near Mount Washington in New Hampshire, can be found within the crescent of the Presidential Mountain Range. On the bottom of the glacially carved valley floor, visitors will find the sparkling waters of Spaulding Lake. The Great Gulf Trail connects a network of smaller trails, and runs about five miles through the wilderness before it stretches on toward Mount Washington's summit. The Appalachian National Scenic Trail also crosses through the wilderness for a little under three miles. Gila Wilderness, New Mexico . Mesas, deep canyons, high mountains, sheer cliffs, woodlands and grasslands stretch across various areas of New Mexico's 558,000-acre Gila Wilderness. The Gila River feeds year-round into creeks and springs that flow through the area, and hot springs are scattered and hidden throughout. A warning: Some of the springwater contains a deadly microorganism, so keep your head out of the hot spring water. Strawberry Mountain Wilderness, Oregon . With seven alpine lakes, and elevations ranging from 4,000 to 9,000 feet, the Strawberry Mountain Wilderness near Prairie City, Oregon, offers beautiful sights to visitors during all seasons. Larches, the only conifer to lose their needles, turn gold in the fall, standing out from the spruce, pine and fir trees that also live in the nearly 70,000-acre wilderness area. True to the wilderness area's name, wild strawberries ripen in July. About 125 miles of trails lure hikers and backpackers to the area. Teton Wilderness, Wyoming . At more than 585,000 acres, Wyoming's Teton Wilderness is just as worthy of visitors as its more famous neighbors. (Yellowstone National Park lies to the north, with Grand Teton National Park to the west.) The wilderness is home to the headwaters of the Yellowstone and Snake Rivers and to Two Ocean Pass, where a creek splits and sends water to both the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans. Teton is one of the country's best wildlife areas, with a variety of different species of animals and birds. Grizzly bears, gray wolves, elk, bobcats and porcupines occupy the area year-round.","Landmark Wilderness Act turns 50 in September .

"(CNN) -- What will President Obama's historical legacy look like decades from now? As the media sort through the debates over the Affordable Care Act and the budget, or the implications of the recent deal with Iran, many Americans are starting to think about how we will remember this president. Predicting presidential legacies is tricky. Historians are particularly skeptical about anyone who thinks he or she can figure out what a president's legacy will be while he's still in office. Why is this? The next president has a big role to play in how a president goes down in the record books. Whoever succeeds President Obama can help to legitimize or undercut the programs that have been put into place since 2009. When Republican President Richard Nixon allowed most of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society to stand, it helped make those policies—and Johnson's domestic legacy—a permanent part of the political landscape. The same had been true during the 1950s, when Dwight Eisenhower opposed efforts to roll back the New Deal. In recent years, President Obama's decision to accept and expand many of President George W. Bush's counterterrorism programs normalized a series of policies that had been highly controversial. Implementation also matters. The success or failure of implementing a president's programs can have huge consequences over the long term when we think about what a president did. The short-term struggles over a policy, such as we are now seeing with the Affordable Care Act, don't matter as much as we might think. Many popular programs, including Social Security, started on shaky ground. But if policymakers can entrench a program, as occurred with Social Security by the 1950s, then the president who first proposed them looks pretty good. The success of Social Security remains integral to Franklin Delano Roosevelt's legacy. Similarly, over time the success of Medicare and Medicaid has made it increasingly apparent that Vietnam often overshadowed the massive domestic accomplishments of Lyndon Johnson. According to a recent CNN/ORC International Poll, a majority of Americans remain open-minded about the Affordable Care Act and believe that it will be fixed. If the regulations start to curb premiums and millions of other Americans have health insurance for the first time, ACA, and President Obama, will look much better. Future events also will determine how we consider the legacy of a president. The interim deal the Obama administration and five other world powers reached with Iran, for instance, won't make much sense until we see how tensions in the region unfold and what exactly comes of Iran's nuclear power. President Ronald Reagan's decision to negotiate with the Soviet Union over intermediate range missiles between 1985 and 1987 could only be assessed after the collapse of the USSR in 1991. The negotiations are now considered to be a crowning achievement of the Reagan presidency, though at the time they were highly controversial, including among conservatives who distrusted Mikhail Gorbachev. President Clinton's economic policies look much better to many Democrats and Republicans in light of the frail economic conditions of the early 21st century. In contrast, the tepid response of the U.S. government to Jewish refugees fleeing from Nazi Germany in the 1930s remains one of the worst moments in FDR's record. Finally, there is no such thing as a fixed presidential legacy. Historians have seen how presidential reputations have changed dramatically over time. Harry Truman left office as one of the most unpopular presidents of the time. He now comes out on the top of most lists of best presidents. What's more, the opening of presidential archives can often give historians a very different impression of how a president performed. Americans also assess their presidents through the lens of the political era in which they live. During the 1980s, a conservative age, there was a more favorable view of Dwight Eisenhower. In recent years, after politics swung toward the liberal side of the spectrum, Lyndon Johnson received a second look. And presidents themselves have been playing a bigger and more active role in shaping the debate about what they did in the White House. Although presidents can't help but think about how they will be treated in the history books, gaming the future is impossible. Indeed, that future will never be set in stone. What presidents can best control are the programs in front of them, making sure that things are working well and that they put into place an infrastructure of policies that has the best chance of outlasting their time in Washington. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: One can't predict sitting president's legacy. Much depends on what comes after .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- A human rights group expressed alarm Thursday at the pace of executions in Iraq and called for Iraqi authorities to abolish the practice. In a statement, Human Rights Watch noted that Iraq has executed at least 65 prisoners since the year began 40 days ago. Fifty-one of the executions occurred in January and 14 so far this month, it said. ""The Iraqi government seems to have given state executioners the green light to execute at will,"" said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. ""The government needs to declare an immediate moratorium on all executions and begin an overhaul of its flawed criminal justice system."" The organization said it was particularly concerned that Iraqi courts use coerced confessions as evidence. ""The government should disclose the identities, locations, and status of all prisoners on death row, the crimes for which they have been convicted, court records for their being charged, tried, and sentenced, and details of any impending executions,"" Human Rights Watch said. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay expressed shock late last month over reports that 34 individuals, including two women, had been executed in Iraq on January 19 following their convictions for crimes. ""Even if the most scrupulous fair trial standards were observed, this would be a terrifying number of executions to take place in a single day,"" Pillay said. ""Given the lack of transparency in court proceedings, major concerns about due process and fairness of trials, and the very wide range of offenses for which the death penalty can be imposed in Iraq, it is a truly shocking figure."" More than 1,200 people are believed to have been sentenced to death since 2004, though the number executed is not known, she said. The death penalty can be imposed for some four dozen crimes, including damage to public property under certain circumstances, she said. She called on the Iraqi government to institute a moratorium on instituting the death penalty. Ministry of Justice officials in Baghdad did not answer their telephones on Thursday. Early this month, Justice Minister Hassan al-Shummari responded to the U.N.'s critique, saying, ""The implementation of fair punishment against terrorists and murderers comes in accord with the law of the state."" In a statement on the ministry's website, he said, ""Questioning the credibility of the Iraqi judiciary system by the U.N. High Commissioner is (a) strange thing and the High Commissioner should also (be) aware of the size of the challenges that Iraq is facing by terrorist groups who had committed heinous crimes and mass executions against innocent people"" Human Rights Watch says it opposes capital punishment ""because of its inhumane nature and its finality."" In its statement, the group says that criminal trials in Iraq often violate standards of fairness, right to defense counsel, right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty and not to be compelled to confess. ""Many defendants are unable to pursue a meaningful defense or to challenge evidence against them, and lengthy pretrial detention without judicial review is common,"" the group says.","Human Rights Watch says at least 65 prisoners have been executed in 40 days .

"(CNN)  -- The director of a Somali radio station was shot dead and a colleague seriously injured in the capital, Mogadishu, on Sunday, according to a local journalist and a Somali journalists' organization. Colleagues carry the body of Somalia's Shabelle radio network's director, Mukhtar Mohammad Hirabe, on Sunday. The assassination of Mukhtar Mohammad Hirabe of Shabelle Media follows last week's abduction of a station director for TV Universal. Hirabe was shot in the head, the journalist said. His colleague Ahmed Omar Tajir was hospitalized. Two men with pistols attacked the two men as they were talking together, said a statement from the National Union of Somali Journalists. Hirabe, 48, director of Radio Shabelle, was shot in the head five times, and Tajir -- identified in the statement as Ahmed Omar Hashi, 47, Radio Shabelle's news editor -- was shot twice in the stomach. Five journalists have been killed in the east African nation this year, including three from Shabelle, the group said. The incidents have left the media community reeling in the east African nation, which has not had an effective government since 1991. The union's statement condemned the violence, with its secretary general, Omar Faruk Osman, saying Hirabe's death was ""premeditated and targeted. ... Colleagues who are committed to do their job in this extreme situation need to be protected."" Another journalist, Nur Muse Hussein, 56, died last month after being shot in April, the organization said. CNN regularly works with Somali journalists who are employed by Shabelle Media.

"New York (CNN) -- Former pharmaceutical executive Gigi Jordan at first appeared calm as she described for a New York jury the last time she saw her son alive, those now-fuzzy final moments before she gave the 8-year-old autistic boy a lethal drug concoction. She ordered him food. She may have put on a movie for him. Little Jude Mirra's vocabulary was limited. He typed on a BlackBerry to communicate with her. ""We were typing throughout some period of time. We were saying goodbye to each other,"" Jordan told the Manhattan jury on Thursday during her second-degree murder trial. She began to cry. ""At some point, I put the pills together,"" she recalled. ""I gave him the pills."" ""Which drugs did you give him more of?"" defense lawyer Allan Brenner asked. ""A lot more of the Ambien,"" she said. ""I gave him more Xanax, but the Ambien is the one I gave him the most of. I gave him Hydrocodone which were large. I was drinking a vodka orange and there was a little left. I broke up the pill and put it into the juice mixed with vodka."" The chilling details came during Jordan's second day on the stand. The defense team is trying to convince the jury that Jordan was a desperate mother ultimately driven to kill Jude because she felt caught between her two ex-husbands. One ex-husband had allegedly threatened to kill her, a crime that would have left Jude with her other ex, his biological father, who she believed had sexually abused the boy. The prosecution has sought to show the jury that the February 2010 killing was premeditated and that Jordan expected to survive. On the stand Thursday, Jordan, a former nurse who made millions in a home heath care company, portrayed her actions as a sort of mercy killing. Her ex-husband was threatening to kill her. ""You're a dead woman,"" she claimed he told her. ""I made the decision I was going to end my life and Jude's life,"" she recalled, placing her hand over her mouth. She said she checked into the luxury Peninsula Hotel in Manhattan. ""Tell us about your state of mind as you crossed the threshold into the hotel?"" her lawyer asked. ""Numb,"" she responded. ""Defeated. I felt like it was over. Like it was done. There was nothing else I could do."" Jude and Jordan spent about six hours in the room before she gave him the pills. She said she had the boy wash down the concoction with orange juice and vodka. Jude was knocked out in 15 minutes. ""Were you able to ascertain if Jude was asleep or in a coma?"" Brenner asked. ""Jude was covered with a blanket,"" she said. ""I couldn't tell... I couldn't tell but I assume he had passed."" Her son breathed rapidly at one point and then stopped. ""At that point, what did you feel and what did you do?"" ""I had a big surge of adrenaline,"" she said. ""My heart started pounding. I grabbed him off the bed and put him on the floor. I was crying and started calling Jude! Jude! Jude! and started doing CPR. I titled his head back, grabbed his nose, gave him two breaths, then gave him 15 compressions. I maybe did this 20 times."" When Brenner asked why she attempted to revive her son, the judge adjourned the proceedings for the night. On Wednesday, Jordan, fighting back tears, testified that she knowingly gave herself and Jude enough drugs to kill them both. When her trial opened last month, Jordan showed no emotion as a prosecutor described to a jury a ""chilling and horrifying scenario"" in which Jordan allegedly forced the boy to swallow the deadly cocktail. Bruises on the boy's nose, chin and chest indicated that she got on top of him and pressed the poisonous mix of painkillers and anti-inflammatories down his throat with a syringe, the prosecutor alleged. Looking gaunt and pale, Jordan denied that scenario on the stand Wednesday. ""Did you climb on top of Jude and grab his jaw and forcibly put liquid drugs down his throat,"" Brenner asked. ""No,"" Jordan told the jury. ""Did you knowingly give Jude and yourself enough drugs to kill yourself and him?"" ""Yes,"" she responded, tears welling in her eyes. Asked about a history of suicide in her family, Jordan said an aunt killed herself when Jordan was 12 and her mother tried three times. On Wednesday, Jordan also suggested that the boy was physically and sexually abused not only by his biological father but also by others, including the woman who took Jude to school. She testified that the boy was assaulted by ""a good number of people."" She testified that one night Jude started screaming, according to Jordan: "" 'Dad bad. Dad bad. Dad bad.' Jude was never able to articulate the word and not clearly like he was screaming at the top of his lungs."" Jordan testified that she held her son as Jude gestured at his crotch. He pulled Jordan in front of him and whispered, ""Dad, butt. Finger, Finger.' He also kept saying dad, and it was clear he was talking about his dad,"" she told the jury. She testified that the boy had been forced to eat feces and do other ""gruesome and horrible"" things by his biological father. The boy's father has denied the allegations and has not been charged, CNN affiliate WCBS reported. In court, no one has disputed the unthinkable manner in which little Jude spent his final hours on February 5, 2010. Police found his cold body after they were dispatched to the hotel. The call to police came after a relative of Jordan was unable to reach her. At an autopsy, four of the painkillers and anti-inflammatories used to kill Jude were recovered undigested from his stomach, prosecutors said. ""His fate was sealed,"" assistant district attorney Matt Bogdanos said in opening statements. ""He didn't die fast. One by one, his vital organs shut down. It didn't take minutes. It took hours to die."" While Jude lay dying, Bogdanos said, Jordan sent an email to a financial adviser instructing him to transfer the $125,000 trust she set up for her son to her personal account. Brenner said Jordan, believing she was ultimately protecting her son, brought the drugs to the hotel room with the intention of killing them both, but she survived the suicide attempt. Bogdanos said Jordan ""went to the bank, she transferred $8 million from savings to checking. She checked in (at the hotel) without a reservation and paid cash."" On the stand, Jordan said she planned on giving the money to charity before taking her life. The exact time of the boy's death could not be determined, but Jude's body temperature was 80 degrees, suggesting that when police arrived, he had been dead for 8 to 14 hours, Bogdanos said. Brenner has sought to show that Jordan acted out of love and desperation. She had been threatened by her first husband and former business partner, Brenner said. She had accused the man of raiding her bank accounts and defrauding her of millions in profits from their joint businesses. She filed a lawsuit against him in 2012, seeking damages for breach of contract and fraud. Her first husband filed a lawsuit in August 2013, claiming Jordan defamed him in interviews she gave the media in an effort to advance her defense. Jordan believed that if she died, Jude's biological father, a yoga instructor, would have gained custody, according to Brenner. Brenner said Jordan told a therapist and local authorities about the alleged abuse but no action was taken. Jordan faces 25 years to life in prison if convicted.

"NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) -- A plane crashed Tuesday in western Kenya, killing all four people on board, including a Cabinet minister and an assistant minister, President Mwai Kibaki said. The two senior government figures were members of Raila Odinga's party. ""The wreckage has been found and there are no survivors,"" Kibaki said, according to the government Web site. Kenyan Roads Minister Kipkalya Kones and Assistant Minister of Home Affairs Lorna Laboso had been on board the Cessna 210, which was headed to Kericho, in the Rift Valley. The plane crashed in a remote area called Kajong'a, in western Kenya, Kibaki said. The president identified the two others killed as Kenneth Kiprono Bett, who worked for Kones, and the pilot. ""Our country has lost leaders of immense potential at their prime age and with a promising future,"" Kibaki said. ""Let us all remain united at this moment of sorrow as a nation."" Salim Lone, a government spokesman, told CNN earlier that the plane crashed about an hour after it took off from Nairobi's Wilson Airport around 2:18 p.m. local time (7:18 a.m. ET). ""This is terrible, and utterly unimaginable news for us in Kenya, where there has been so much suffering recently,"" Lone said. He did not know what caused the crash, but said, ""There is absolutely no hint of foul play. It looks like a terrible tragedy."" Both Kones and Laboso belonged to the Orange Democratic Movement party (ODM), which joined Kibaki's Party of National Unity (PNU) in a coalition government earlier this year under an United Nations-brokered agreement that brought an end to the violence that ripped the nation after Kibaki's disputed re-election in late December. More than 1,000 people were killed and 350,000 were displaced in the violence, according to the Kenyan Red Cross. Under the agreement, Kibaki retained the presidency while ODM leader Raila Odinga became prime minister. A new cabinet took office in April, with equal representation from both ODM and PNU. The officials' deaths came a day before parliamentary by-elections in five districts in Kenya.","Roads minister, assistant home affairs minister die in plane crash .

"(CNN) -- A 10-year-old girl, brutally raped, confronts her attacker in court. The culprit -- a cleric -- tries to pass it off as ""consensual sex."" A judge sentences him to 20 years and some $30,000 in fines. What's extraordinary is that these scenes played out Saturday in a courtroom in Kabul, Afghanistan. The case is being hailed by women's rights groups and activists as a watershed moment, in a country where women are still the targets of violence, despite reforms since the fall of the Taliban in 2001. ""This case shows the level of cruelty that children in Afghanistan face,"" said Horia Mosadiq, an Afghanistan researcher with Amnesty International. ""This is not an isolated case."" What's unusual about this case is that the victim had the courage to step forward, said Naheed Samadi Bahram, program director for Women for Afghan Women, or WAW, an international women's rights organization helping with the case. ""It makes us believe and trust more in the justice system in the country,"" Bahram said, speaking to CNN by phone from Kabul. ""A little young girl from a far province gets justice for herself, this is amazing. This is a success for human rights in the country"". A hateful crime . The rape occurred in May, in the girl's village in Kunduz, in northern Afghanistan, according to media reports. The group sheltered the victim and helped her family navigate the legal process. This is their account of what happened: . The perpetrator, Mullah Mohammad Amin, was a local mullah who taught the girls religious studies. One day in May, the mullah asked three girls to stay behind after classes to help clean the mosque. When they were about to leave, he asked the victim to stay. He then tied her hands, taped her mouth and raped her. She went home and was later examined by a doctor, who confirmed the rape. The police were informed and the mullah was arrested. The girl stayed at the WAW women's shelter for a few days and was then sent to Kabul for treatment. Amin was prosecuted under the Elimination of Violence against Women law, passed in 2009. While the law has been on the books for the past few years, it had not been strongly implemented, Najia Nasim, country director for WAW, told CNN from Kabul. ""To seek justice for these cases is unusual. They are normally not reported; even if they are reported they are not followed up. The women don't want to bring shame to their family. Some are not aware of the law; others don't trust the government."" Patti Gossman, a senior researcher on Afghanistan at Human Rights Watch, agreed that it is uncommon for rape cases to get this far. ""It's quite unusual that she would bring this case,"" Gossman said. ""Most women would be afraid."" There was also concern, when this case surfaced, about honor killings, she said. Dramatic courtroom testimony . On Saturday, the victim showed up at the Kabul courtroom accompanied by her father and uncle, said Bahram, who attended the proceedings in Kabul. The trial lasted nearly two hours, she said. The mullah sat on the floor, shackled with chains attached to handcuffs, Bahram said, while his young victim kept her face covered with a scarf. She wept most of the time, Bahram said. The trial began with the mullah's two defense attorneys reading his statement given to police after his arrest, in which the cleric admitted to having sex with the girl. The lawyers tried to persuade the court that the sex was consensual and that he should be given only 100 lashes as punishment, Bahram said. Judge Sulaiman Rasouli rejected that argument because it would mean lashing the girl too and treating her as an adulterer rather than a rape victim, according to news reports. When Amin, speaking in his own defense, said the victim had seduced him, the girl reacted strongly. ""You are a liar... I never loved you... you forced me to do this, you ruined my life... God will hate you for what you did to me, he will punish you,"" Bahram said, paraphrasing the victim. The girl's father also spoke up in the court, saying he trusted his daughter and that she never lied, Bahram said. ""The welcome step in this case is that the judge did not charge the child,"" said Gossman. ""In a country where there are several women and girls imprisoned for moral crimes, that's a positive."" The court sentenced the mullah to the maximum 20-year sentence. Amin's lawyers are expected to appeal to try to reduce the sentence. Victim still traumatized . The victim is still very traumatized and emotionally fragile, said Nasim, who met the girl Sunday. ""She's a very shy girl; she does not talk much, but when you ask her about the case she starts to cry,"" Nasim said. In an interview with Afghanistan's TOLO news agency, her father, who is deaf, said he hopes the sentencing would dissuade other perpetrators from committing such crimes in the future. ""Justice should be preserved so others will send their children to mosques,"" he told TOLO. ""When family and victims raise their voice it is unusual, but luckily more and more families are speaking out,"" said Amnesty International's Mosadiq, who credits the hard work of women's rights groups for the legal victory. ""To some extent this is a victory, but we still have a long way to go.""","Afghan cleric raped 10-year-old girl in mosque .

"Cleveland (CNN) -- Seldom does a daughter use such harsh words to describe her own father. Ariel Castro's daughter called him ""the most evil, vile, demonic criminal"" she ever heard of during a CNN exclusive interview Thursday. ""He is dead to me,"" Angie Gregg said of the father police say kidnapped, held captive, raped and beat three young women in Cleveland for about a decade. She had known her ""daddy"" as a ""friendly, caring, doting man."" Now shocked and in disbelief, Gregg says she never wants to see him again. ""There will be no visits; there will be no phone calls,"" she said. ""He can never be Daddy again. I have no sympathy for the man."" As she mulled the accusations against him, she asked, ""How could you?"" ""I wonder this whole time, how he could be so good to us, but he (allegedly) took young women, little girls, someone else's babies, away from these families and over the years never felt enough guilt to just give up and let them free."" Gregg did not think anything out of the ordinary was going on in her childhood home. All that changed Monday when Amanda Berry broke loose. Police freed her fellow captives Georgina DeJesus and Michelle Knight, divulging the secret locked up inside the house at 2207 Seymour Ave. Snapshots: Who are the three women freed in Cleveland? When she first heard the news about their captivity, Gregg said, she ""just wanted to die."" She had known Berry and DeJesus from her school days. Peculiarities she noticed about her father over the years started falling into place in a new, grim light, and they are making her feel ""horrified,"" she said. ""This was going on right under my nose."" An odd place to visit . When she came calling, ""he would take forever to come to the door,"" she said. He always had the house locked up tight. Standing at a window, Castro would often give her a hand signal indicating to her to wait. Then he'd wave her around to the back door, not letting her in through the front of the house. Once inside, visits were fun and cordial. Gregg, her husband and Castro ""ate, looked at photos and listened to music,"" she said. ""He appeared to be happy to see us and never rushed for us to leave."" At times, he would disappear from dinner and give no explanation for his absence. The music was usually turned up loud, but Gregg thought this to be fitting since Castro was a musician. Once she asked if she could go upstairs to see her childhood bedroom. Castro coaxed her out of the idea, telling her, ""Oh, honey, there's so much junk up there. You don't want to go up there,"" she said. Again, she thought nothing of it, ""besides him being a pack rat."" The basement was always locked. Prosecutor: 'Kidnapper operated torture chamber' Clinging to the house . The list of oddities continued. Castro clung to home, never wanting to leave for more than a day, even to visit Gregg out of state when she lived with her family in Indiana. ""He was adamant in the fact that he wanted to leave home early morning and he had to be back by evening,"" Gregg said. Her family often made travel plans with Castro that they then had to cancel because of her father's obsession with his own four walls. Gregg said that she never saw signs of the 6-year-old at her father's house and that she never saw her with him. But about two months ago, he showed her a picture in his cell phone. Gregg asked who it was. Her father told her that the girl was his girlfriend's child by somebody else. ""I figured at the most he had an illegitimate child out there, you know, and I would find out eventually,"" Gregg said. She asked him to get a paternity test. She wanted to know if she had another sister out there somewhere. Now she knows that she does. Daughter Emily Castro in prison for slashing baby's throat . Domestic violence . Gregg recalled fond memories of growing up in the house and fun times with her father. He lined up the children in the backyard and trimmed their bangs himself, she said. He took her for rides on his motorcycle. And he never abused her, she said, or her sisters, as far as she knows. But he beat their mother, Grimilda Figueroa, whom he accused of fooling around with neighbors. He was very jealous, Gregg said. ""When Mom and Dad were fighting, it's like I just wanted to melt into the ground,"" she said. ""I've seen him basically stomp on her like she was a man,"" Gregg remembered. Then after a bludgeoning, her mother had enough, and the family split up. The other children left with her mother, but Gregg stuck by Castro, believing the excuses he made for the violence. She finished growing up under his roof, she said. How this case differed from the 'House of Horrors' A daughter divorced . Gregg is through believing in her father and is appalled at the extent of his alleged deception and cruelty. ""To go to the vigils, to show these girls the footage of their parents' pleas for their return, to rape, starve and beat innocent human beings ... I am disgusted."" Gregg wants the girls who suffered in captivity to get the treatment they need, recover as well as they can and have the best lives possible. It was the first thing she mentioned during the interview. She is relieved to see them and the little girl, her new sister, return to their families. She hopes they can understand her father's actions are not a reflection on her family. ""We don't have monster in our blood,"" she said. Gregg's mother died in 2012 after a bout with brain cancer. Now she has lost her father, too. She still cries for her mother, she said. ""I don't cry for him."" Get all the latest developments in the Cleveland case .

"(CNN) -- It says a lot about how jovial a person was, and how fondly that person is liable to be remembered, when your first thought upon hearing of that person's death is a clear memory of a loud, long, infectious laugh. Tom Magliozzi, who died Monday at age 77, was exactly that sort of guy. If you ever listened to Tom and younger brother Ray, 65, bantering on NPR's long-running ""Car Talk"" radio show, you know the laugh. And if you don't, why in the world not? These two siblings -- equal parts auto mechanics, students of the human condition and sit-down comics -- first appeared on public radio locally, with a program from Boston's WBUR in 1977. They and their show went national on NPR in 1987, the same year Philadelphia's ""Fresh Air"" with Terry Gross, the program to which I contribute as TV critic and occasional substitute host, also went national on NPR. Yet I never met Tom or Ray, and never even phoned their call-in show to be advised, harangued and entertained. It was enough just to listen each week -- so much so that, though I didn't know Tom personally, I feel like I did, and I feel a genuine loss at the news of his death from complications from Alzheimer's. And I'm guessing, if you're taking the time to read this, you feel exactly the same. The two men stopped generating new ""Car Talk"" episodes in 2012. By then though, they'd generated such a backlog that the best archived shows could be repeated without any drop in momentum -- just without the ability for listeners to call in. And not even that seemed to matter, because the callers on those old shows, and the way Tom and Ray -- aka Click and Clack, the Tappet Brothers -- interacted with them was more than entertaining enough to make up for it. Apparently, that will continue to be true. Ray has been quoted as saying he would like the shows to continue as a tribute to his brother. Selfishly, I'd like them to continue, too, because the running of my weekend errands always went a little smoother when ""Car Talk"" was on my car radio. Smoother, but not faster, because I'd often stay in the car listening, long after arriving at my destination, just to hear how Tom and Ray dealt with their callers, and especially with each other. Their automotive advice usually was sound, even if it sounded off the cuff and occasionally even flippant. But the two of them -- especially Tom, who was quick with a joke and quicker with a probing but good-natured personal question -- were equally adept at sharing advice outside the car frames. Any time a caller began a plea for help with ""My husband says ...,"" or ""My girlfriend hates it when I ...,"" you knew you were in for an overtime session, sitting there listening to the two brothers dispense advice and laughter in fairly equal measure. It's clear, from a listener's perspective, that they loved people, loved each other and loved being on the radio. Listen to them for hours, or for years -- or for decades, as I have -- and I challenge you to find one moment where either of them sounds remotely stiff or nervous. Even when reading those tongue-twisting, tongue-in-cheek closing credits or working their way through the ultra-complicated puzzles of the week (I've yet to solve even one), they're loose, laughing, and having fun. That's not common on public radio. And it's a real gift. Listening to them was like eavesdropping on a raucous family conversation, because that's exactly what was happening. The laughs the ""Car Talk"" siblings brought to public radio could be assessed historically, if you wanted to go that way and place Click and Clack in a media context. Like Garrison Keillor's ""Prairie Home Companion"" on American Public Radio, ""Car Talk"" took itself frivolously -- and pioneered such later public radio comedy confections as NPR's ""Wait, Wait ... Don't Tell Me!,"" distributed out of Chicago. It's neither coincidence nor a surprise that both shows are produced by the same man, Doug Berman, who clearly sees the value of a good laugh. On radio, of course, you don't need to ""see"" a good laugh. Just hear it. And Tom's laugh was one of the warmest, loudest, most delightful laughs of all. I sure will miss it.","Tom Magliozzi, one half of jovial, iconic ""Car Talk"" radio duo, has died .

"(CNN) -- The Chinese legal advocate Chen Guangcheng, facing the end of his fellowship at New York University, has claimed that NYU is forcing him out due to Chinese pressure. NYU's participation in a complex deal to allow Chen to leave China to study gave the dissident and his family breathing space, and helped the United States and China untangle a thorny diplomatic dilemma after Chen fled to the U.S. embassy in Beijing in April 2012. NYU in fact did a great favor not only for Chen but also for both the U.S. and Chinese governments. NYU's spokesman says the end of Chen's fellowship ""has nothing to do with the Chinese government; all fellowships come to an end."" Chen has, in any case, other job options. But whether there was Chinese pressure or not in this case, Chen's experience and allegations highlight the many challenges faced by U.S. academic institutions in the context of evolving Sino-U.S. relations. Despite criticism of its cost, content, admissions criteria or tenure system, U.S. post-secondary education, be it at top-tier research institutions, private liberal arts colleges or large state universities, remains the best worldwide. That's why students from all over the world strive to come here. Along with high-tech and Hollywood, our university education is among America's top exports, something we still do better than any other country. Chinese dissident: NYU is forcing me out . And China, perhaps more than anywhere, reveres education. More scholars than generals occupy China's pantheon of national heroes. Besides Confucius and Mencius, there's Qu Yuan, patron saint of intellectuals, whom Chinese commemorate this time every year with dragon boats and rice wrapped in bamboo leaves. Chinese parents across the social spectrum struggle to give their children the best education. Not surprisingly, then, as Chinese become wealthier, more Chinese students flock to the United States to study. U.S. universities, too, are opening satellite branches to serve this market within China. Meanwhile, the Chinese state is attempting to promote Chinese-language study and enhance its ""soft power"" in the United States by installing Confucius Institutes on U.S. campuses. Chinese students and faculty engage in surprisingly open discourse, even criticism of their government, on campuses in China. But the notion of academic freedom for its own sake is not a feature of Chinese universities. Rather, the general expectation (not always accepted by students and faculty) is that education should serve the state. The Chinese state thus attempts to control the message on its campuses. In U.S. colleges and universities, on the other hand, academic freedom is tied to our ideal that education is primarily for the benefit of the individual, and that it is by empowering individuals of diverse outlooks that society as a whole benefits the most. Two tendencies are now converging, just as U.S. and Chinese academic communities become more inter-meshed. Rising China has taken steps to export and police the message on campuses abroad by denying visas to U.S. academic critics or pressuring universities over dissidents or speeches by such figures as the Dalai Lama. Meanwhile, cash-strapped U.S. institutions increasingly value China as a market; deans and provosts, gung-ho about their flashy new China initiatives, have not been as supportive of academic freedom as they should. If Chen Guangcheng's departure from NYU owes anything to Chinese pressure, his is but one, high-profile case. As we go forward, should more such incidents arise, here's what both sides should do: China, please abandon counterproductive efforts to intimidate foreign institutions and scholars. Ham-fisted bullying only undermines the very soft power that was your goal in the first place, and ticks off the teachers who teach foreigners about China. And deans and provosts at U.S. institutions: Don't be craven about academic freedom. Join together with other institutions and take a firm, principled stand to support scholars. Don't be afraid to do what NYU did in hosting a dissident or to take bold steps if China denies a visa to one of your professors. We are the No. 1 global brand in university education, largely because of our principles. Where else is China going to go?

"(CNN) -- For weeks, Nigerian officials said that more than 200 Nigerian school girls would finally be freed. When it fell apart, there was nothing but devastation. Over and over, sources told CNN's Isha Sesay that negotiations between the government and Boko Haram, the group that snatched the girls in April, were getting somewhere. The journalist was assured that the Islamist terror group had agreed to a cease-fire, and as part of that deal, the girls would be able to return to their families. For once, Sesay allowed herself to feel optimistic. A native of Sierra Leone, the journalist was personally drawn to the tragedy that inspired the global campaign ""Bring Back Our Girls."" ""Those girls were poor, from a remote part of Nigeria,"" in Chibok in Borno State, Sesay said. The area has been long ignored, and the people there have gotten by on very little, she said. The girls were kidnapped while they were at school. ""They were just trying to get an education,"" Sesay said. ""But for the grace of God, I come from an educated family and my life has been different. It's the power of education that has allowed me to become a CNN anchor. These girls were in school to change their circumstances."" Sesay got on a plane to Nigeria days ago as sources told her that the girls' freedom was imminent. When she landed she started to hear more from journalists who have extensively covered Boko Haram, and from those who knew how the terror group operated. They were suspicious, and doubted that the government was really in talks with the terrorists. There were other red flags. No one from Boko said anything about the supposed cease-fire. In fact, members remained active in northeastern Nigeria, and actually carried out more attacks and child abductions. Sesay and her CNN crew kept hoping. Maybe it was simple banditry in the north, she reasoned. It was hard to bear the idea that the girls wouldn't be freed. ""We wanted to believe,"" she said. ""We gave (Nigerian officials) the benefit of the doubt, I suppose."" A crushing video . On November 1, a video appeared of Boko Haram leader, Abubakar Shekau saying no cease-fire been reached. The girls were not going to be released, he said, laughing. They had converted to Islam and were married off. ""They are,"" he said, ""in the marital homes."" It was a crushing blow. ""It was like he was saying, 'This is done,' "" Sesay recalled. After the video was released, Nigeria's government asserted that negotiations had happened, and Shekau had gone back on promises he'd made during those talks. ""We've heard about the video, and we can say the road to peace is bumpy -- and you cannot expect otherwise,"" a spokesman said. ""Nigeria has been fighting a war, and wars don't end overnight."" In late October, Human Rights Watch released a report on Boko Haram violence against women and girls in Nigeria. The group interviewed kidnap victims including a dozen of the Chibok girls who escaped. The girls had been imprisoned in eight Boko Haram camps in the Sambisa Forest Reserve, the report said. The women and girls who refused to convert to Islam were physically and sexually assaulted, HRW said, and some were forced to marry their captors. Men and boys who were abducted, the report says, were given the choice of joining the group or being murdered. What gives Boko Haram its strength? 'How could they do this?' Before she left Nigeria, Sesay called Obiageli Ezekwesili, a former Nigerian government official and one of the leaders of the Bring Back Our Girls campaign. ""She sounded sick with grief when she answered the phone,"" Sesay recalled. ""I said ... 'Are you OK?' which is ... so stupid. She was just -- her voice was hoarse with pain. She said, 'How could they do this?' "" Ezekwesili said she wasn't sure if the parents of the girls would recover. Sesay said she is committed to continue to tell the girls' stories. Each is a person. Each deserves to live out their unique passions and paths. ""We have to keep asking questions,"" she said. ""We have set expectations low in terms of getting meaningful answers. That can't continue."" Boko Haram -- the essence of terror .","CNN's Isha Sesay is personally driven to continue to tell the story of kidnapped Nigerian school girls .
She went to Africa because sources told her that terror group Boko Haram would release the girls .

"(CNN) -- It is rare when politicians decide to make government reform the centerpiece of their campaigns. Although Americans always complain about government, polls show that most voters care most about ""bread and butter"" issues when they make decisions about who their leaders should be. 2014 might be different. The partial government shutdown is just one more example in an ongoing series of political meltdowns that has left the country extraordinarily frustrated with Washington, and with Republicans in particular. On the second day of the shutdown, polls showed that congressional approval ratings had fallen to an abysmal 10%. As a result of what has taken place in the past few years, there is a genuine opportunity for a marriage between partisan interests and government reform in the 2014 midterm elections. Democrats will have an opportunity to develop a successful campaign around government reform, returning to issues that President Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008 but has generally neglected ever since. Many Republicans, equally frustrated with their tea party counterparts, might echo similar themes so as to not be outdone by their competitors. If Democrats are able to take control of Congress and create a united government for two more years, they would give Obama an opportunity to make progress on these issues before his term ends. Budget reform must be at the center of the message. The budget process has become a total mess. Congress is unable to reach basic agreements about spending and the existing process offers legislators too many opportunities to wreak havoc in their effort to extract concessions from opponents. There are many proposals for reform that have been floated. Eliminating the debt ceiling is one possibility, so that debates about spending cannot turn into threats to the global economy. Another proposal is to move toward biennial budgeting to facilitate long-term planning and reduce the number of annual skirmishes that take place over funding. Centralizing and reorganizing the process could produce fewer points of conflict, while some experts, such as William Galston have proposed tying congressional pay to on-time appropriations decisions. Campaign finance reform must be tackled. When Senator Ted Cruz delivered his long speech before the government shutdown began, he knew exactly what he was doing. His dramatic actions have been targeted toward issue-based interest groups that feed the coffers of legislators. This is but one aspect of a campaign finance process where the barriers toward injecting private money into elections have almost completely broken down. The Supreme Court is currently considering a major case that threatens to undercut the limitations that exist on individual donors. But whatever the court does, Congress could pass legislation placing tighter constraints on contributions in the wake of the Citizens United decision, providing some form of public funding, and restricting the kinds of activities that third party organizations can engage. These would help to lessen the pressure that members of both parties feel to please the donors during budget battles and enable them to focus more attention on the challenges of governing the nation. The filibuster is another long acknowledged procedural problem which creates a difficult system in the Senate where a supermajority of 60 votes is needed to pass legislation. Although the heart of the current budget stalemate has to do with the House Republicans, the supermajority requirement in the Senate has become a huge source of obstruction in recent years. As with budget reform, there have been many proposals to overhaul the filibuster, including lowering the number of senators needed to end a filibuster or prohibiting certain kinds of stalling tactics that do not technically amount to a filibuster. The filibuster is not enshrined in the Constitution and has been reformed before, including in 1975 when the Senate lowered the number of senators needed to end debate from 2/3rd to 3/5th of the chamber. The convergence of midterm elections and reform can have a powerful effect. In 1974, the newly elected ""Watergate Babies"" campaigned on the theme of government reform in the shadow of the scandal and many of the issues they tackled -- such as campaign finance reform, openness in government, ethics rules, and mor -- became enshrined in the law. There is an opportunity for this to happen again. Although the current budget standoff is not a scandal akin to Watergate, the levels of public frustration are extremely high. Moreover, the consequences could be severe. If there is another shock to the global economy as a result of the debt ceiling debate, as we saw in 2011, the public's view of the urgency of changing the legislative process will greatly increase. The issues could help Democrats regain their majority, and at the same time might create the right conditions for Congress to pass reforms in 2015 and 2016. Enough moderate Republicans are clearly frustrated that they might join, making this a bipartisan effort, and one that changes the basic rules of the game for both parties going into the next presidential administration. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: 2014 campaign could provide unusual opportunity for congressional reformers .

"Santa Maria, Brazil (CNN) -- Workers combing through the charred wreckage of Kiss nightclub in southern Brazil on Sunday encountered the eerie sound of ringing cell phones. Glauber Fernandes, a reporter from CNN affiliate Band News, explains. ""It was a really complicated scene. A lot of smoke, a lot of shoes that was left, cell phones, because everybody tried to get out of there running,"" he said. ""While we were there, we saw the cell phones were ringing. It was parents, friends, trying to know about what was happening and nobody was answering."" A fire swept through the packed, popular nightclub in Santa Maria early Sunday, killing at least 233 people -- enough to fill a large plane -- Brazilian Health Minister Alexandro Padilha told reporters. Of those, 185 have been identified so far. Many apparently died from smoke inhalation. Others were trampled in the rush for the exits, one security guard told Band News. More than 90 people were hospitalized, Padilha said, including 14 patients with severe burns. Deadly blazes: Nightclub tragedies in recent history . About 2,000 people were inside the club when the fire broke out -- double the maximum capacity of 1,000, said Guido de Melo, a state fire official. Investigators have received preliminary information that security guards stopped people from exiting the club, he told Globo TV. ""People who were inside the facility informed us ... that security guards blocked the exit to prevent people there from leaving, and that's when the crowd starting panicking, and the tragedy grew worse,"" he said. The fire started ""from out of nowhere"" on a stage at the club and quickly spread to the ceiling, witness Jairo Vieira told Band News. ""People started running,"" survivor Luana Santos Silva told Globo TV. ""I fell on the floor."" There was a pyrotechnics show going on inside the club when the fire started. Authorities stopped short of blaming it for the blaze, saying the cause was still under investigation. The Kiss nightclub is popular with young people in Santa Maria, which is home to a number of universities and colleges, including the Federal University of Santa Maria. At least 80 of those killed Sunday were students at that school, it said. The blaze broke out during a weekend when students were celebrating the end of summer. Many universities are set to resume classes on Monday. Video from the scene showed firefighters shooting streams of water at the club and shirtless men trying to break down a wall with axes. Smoke billowed outside the front of the building as the stench of fire filled the air, said Max Muller, who was riding by on his motorbike when he saw the blaze. Muller recorded video of a chaotic scene outside the club, which showed emergency crews tending to victims and dazed clubgoers standing in the street. Bodies lay on the ground beside ambulances. Friends who were inside the club told him that many struggled to find the exits in the dark. Muller, who was not inside the club Sunday morning but has been there twice before, said there were no exit signs over the doors. It is rare to see such signs in Brazilian clubs. Valderci Oliveira, a state lawmaker, told Band News that he saw piles of bodies in the club's bathroom when he arrived at the scene hours after the blaze. It looked ""like a war zone,"" he said. Read more: How to protect yourself in a crowd . Police told Band News that 90% of the victims were found in that part of the club. The roof collapsed in several parts of the building, trapping many inside, said Fernandes, the reporter from Band News. For others, escaping was complicated by the fact that guards initially stopped people from leaving, he said, echoing comments from the state fire official. ""Some guards thought at first that it was a fight, a huge fight that happened inside the club and closed the doors so that the people could not leave without paying their bills from the club,"" Fernandes said. The deadly fire is sure to shine a spotlight on safety in Brazil, which is set to host the World Cup next year and the Olympics in 2016. Many wept as they searched for information outside a local gymnasium where bodies were taken for identification later Sunday. Inside, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff met with family members and friends as they waited on bleachers for word of their loved ones. Rousseff became teary-eyed as she spoke of the fire to reporters in Chile earlier Sunday. She had been attending a regional summit there, but cut short the trip and returned to Brazil early to deal with the aftermath of the tragedy. ""The Brazilian people are the ones who need me today,"" she said. ""I want to tell the people of Santa Maria in this time of sadness that we are all together."" The fire started around 2 a.m. after the acoustic insulation in the Kiss nightclub caught fire, said Civil Defense Col. Adilomar Silva. An accordionist who had been performing onstage with a band when the blaze broke out was among the dead, drummer Eliel de Lima told Globo TV. Police were questioning the club's owner and interviewing witnesses as part of an investigation into what caused the blaze, state-run Agencia Brasil reported. The club's license had expired in August and had not been renewed, local fire official Moises da Silva Fuchs told Globo TV. The incident called to mind a 2003 nightclub fire in Rhode Island where pyrotechnics used by the heavy metal band Great White ignited a blaze that killed 100 people. Pyrotechnics were also involved in a 2004 nightclub fire in Argentina that killed 194 people and a 2009 explosion at a nightclub in Russia that left more than 100 dead. Shasta Darlington reported from Santa Maria, Brazil. Marilia Brocchetto and Dana Ford reported from Atlanta. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet, Helena DeMoura and Samira Jafari contributed to this report.","Cell phones left in the club ring, go unanswered amid the ruins .

"Washington (CNN) -- Prosecutors hope to determine by Labor Day whether Virginia's first family broke any laws regarding a gift-giving scandal that has engulfed Gov. Bob McDonnell and tarnished the once-sterling reputation of the Republican politician, a source with knowledge of the matter told CNN. Lawyers for McDonnell and his wife met with prosecutors in the city of Alexandria on Monday as the Justice Department sought clarity over previously undisclosed gifts given to the governor and his family by the chief executive of a troubled dietary supplement company. McDonnell had no comment on the meetings. The desire to reach some kind of conclusion about the direction of the investigation in coming weeks revolves around the Virginia election in November to chose McDonnell's successor. The Justice Department generally avoids bringing cases against politicians if it might impact an election. That race is one of the nastiest gubernatorial contests in the country. It's between Republican Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, who has his own ties to the man behind the McDonnell scandal, and Democrat Terry McAuliffe, a heavyweight political fundraiser, businessman and close friend of Bill and Hillary Clinton. It has been a stunning turn of events for McDonnell, a well mannered former star in Republican politics who rose from state legislator to Virginia attorney general to governor. McDonnell's future was so bright not long ago. He won the governorship handily in 2009 and had maintained his popularity in a southern presidential battleground state that votes blue, but just barely. His fundraising acumen, message discipline and understated charm helped lift him to the chairmanship of the Republican Governors Association in 2011, a post other governors have used as a springboard to a presidential campaign. He was mentioned as a possible running mate for Mitt Romney. ""Clearly Bob McDonnell has had a great interest in national office. It was clear following his landslide victory for governor,"" said Jeff Schapiro, columnist for the Richmond Times-Dispatch. But things came apart this year over revelations about the first family's ties to Jonnie Williams of Star Scientific, a friend and campaign contributor. Questions center on gifts: $15,000 for catering costs for McDonnell's daughter's wedding, $15,000 for clothing purchases for his wife, Maureen, and $6,500 for a Rolex watch. Maureen McDonnell also bought stock in the company and promoted its products at a luncheon at the governor's mansion in Richmond. A key question remains: Did McDonnell accept things of value in exchange for official acts -- which he denies -- or did he willfully turn a blind eye to gifts for his wife? McDonnell maintains he didn't know about the gifts or the stock and has denied wrongdoing. McDonnell said he has already repaid Williams tens of thousands of dollars and said he has broken no laws. He and his allies have cautiously defended the lack of disclosure as consistent with Virginia law, which does not require elected officials to report gifts provided to family members like McDonnell's wife and daughter. Elected officials in Virginia are allowed to accept gifts over $50, as long as they are publicly disclosed. McDonnell has reported other gifts from Williams, including a stay at a lake house and private plane travel. Williams has also given generously to McDonnell's political organization. Andrew McBride, a former U.S. attorney in Alexandria, told CNN this would be a very difficult case for prosecutors without clear evidence of a quid pro quo. ""You have the money aspect, and you have the receipt of the money, what I don't see for a federal crime right now is the governor acting in his official capacity in order to aid Star Scientific, in exchange for the money,"" said McBride. There are calls for McDonnell to step down, but he said in July that he plans to finish his term. Although prosecutors apparently do not like for these kinds of investigations to impact elections, Cuccinelli has not escaped the controversy. He owned stock in Williams' company but sold off shares earlier this year. He also collected more than $18,000 in gifts from the executive and stayed at his vacation house. An ethics investigation of Cuccinelli's relationship with Williams cleared the attorney general of any wrongdoing but revealed that Cuccinelli put the executive in touch with an attorney who could help him win grants from a state agency. Resignation would solve one problem, create another . CNN's Peter Hamby contributed to this report.","Prosecutors trying to determine by Labor Day whether to bring charges against McDonnell .

"(CNN) -- I suppose we like to predict the future because uncertainty makes us uncomfortable. Or maybe we just like the game of analysis. Before a baseball season starts, for example, you'll find experts predicting who will win the pennant races and the World Series. Indeed, it's not even a month after the Super Bowl and you can find confident assurances of who will be in the big game next year. Politics is no different, of course, although the prediction business has more important consequences. I think we -- and by ""we"" I mean all of us in the news and commentary business -- have to be careful to distinguish between analysis and prediction. True, the predictive powers of polls has improved since Thomas Dewey ""defeated"" Harry Truman in 1948, but as any meteorologist will tell you, the farther away the weather system, the more difficult it is to predict its behavior on a given day. Analysis, on the other hand, can give us a better understanding of issues, effects of policies, and the all-important ""mood of the electorate,"" even though those can change as quickly as the path of a tornado. What brings all this to mind is a recent article by Sahil Kapur for the online Talking Points Memo, ""Four Reasons the GOP Has a Huge Advantage in the 2014 Elections."" The article argues that, ""For all their internal divisions and long-term worries as a party, political scientists and historical trends give Republicans a clear advantage in the upcoming 2014 congressional elections."" I'm not refuting the Four Reasons (good thing they're not Four Horseman). I just question if they are so predictively absolute. I see other factors at play. The first factor Kapur writes about is ""the six-year curse for presidents."" He notes, ""Since the ratification of White House term limits, five of the six two-term presidents have lost seats after re-election."" What intrigues me is the exception: Bill Clinton in 1998, because of a strong economy and voter backlash against the Republican-led impeachment. Democrats that year fought back hard by recruiting good quality candidates who gained the trust of the people. Speaking of President Clinton, he's campaigning for Alison Grimes in Kentucky. Despite all the recent attacks, the Clintons' popularity remains sky high across the country, including in the South. Democratic candidates are hopeful they will be able to campaign for them across the country. See Gov. Terry McAuliffe. So that's X-factor one. Midterm elections are only partly a referendum on the president. With the Clintons campaigning, the equation changes. The second reason is ""Democratic voters don't turn out in midterms."" The historical trend shows that age is a factor: ""Older voters disproportionately turn out in midterms, and they've moved to the Republican Party in recent decades,"" argues Kapur. And yet, the Republican attempts at voter suppression may well backfire. Perhaps the GOP's current campaign to block attempts to extend unemployment insurance, block a raise in the minimum wage and take away health care will motivate some voters to turn out because it's in their self interest. We all know that an angry electorate is a voting electorate. I expect young people and minorities to surprise the pundits. I expect women to organize and vote in surprising numbers. A threatened electorate is also a voting electorate. Voter turnout comes down to organizing, educating, activating. From what I've seen in my travels around the country, there's a grass-roots groundswell that may very well resemble the 1998 ""backlash."" The third factor Kapur cites is that ""Republicans have a mathematical advantage in the Senate."" They need to pick up a net of six seats. Democrats are defending 21 seats, many in conservative states such as Arkansas, North Carolina and Louisiana. Here's the thing: In the 12 states that Mitt Romney won that also had a Senate race, Democrats won five of them: North Dakota, Montana, Missouri, Indiana and West Virginia. These states are at least as conservative as the Southern states above. Generally, Senate races are not a referendum on the president or on any one issue, but a choice between the two candidates on the ballot. Thus Democrat Mary Landrieu remains strong in Louisiana, while in Kentucky, Republican Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, is in trouble. As Tip O'Neill observed, ""All politics is local."" In each competitive Senate race there's a clear contrast between a Democratic candidate -- focused on creating opportunity for the middle class and willing to disagree with the party leadership -- and a Republican candidate beholden to the tea party, the Koch brothers and a small group of right-wing billionaires who support an agenda that will not enable the middle class or working families to prosper. While some Democratic senators and a handful of congressional candidates may disagree with the President on specific economic priorities for their state, they all support his efforts to provide better wages for workers, fairness for women in the workplace and affordable opportunities to go to college and prepare for high-skilled jobs. Despite an influx of negative ads underwritten by the Koch brothers and their allies, Democrats must find a way to stay on message and reach people where they live, work, eat and pray. Finally, Kapur mentions that ""the House map is skewed toward the GOP."" There's no disputing this, just as there's no disputing the fact that Republican obstructionism in the House has prevented the country from moving forward. How much did Republican gerrymandering after 2010 lockjaw the House? Political scientists may debate that, but House majorities do change, and sometimes unexpectedly. My point is that the ""season"" hasn't started. We can analyze strengths and weaknesses, but let's see how the teams play over the long haul, starting now with the upcoming primary elections. Once the primary season has ended, we can start keeping score. Until then, the sideshow is simply a distraction. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama is back in Washington after a three-day trip to Colorado and Texas that included fund-raising for his Democratic colleagues and meetings with governors and legislators and mayors and citizens. When asked why he didn't visit the border, the President responded (and please, fellow commentators, let's get the quote and the context right): ""...there's nothing that is taking place down there that I am not intimately aware of and briefed on. This isn't theater. This is a problem. I'm not interested in photo-ops; I'm interested in solving a problem. And ... the suggestions of those who work at the border, who visited the border, are incorporated in legislation [that I've already sent to Congress] that we're already prepared to sign the minute it hits my desk."" Context: There's a time and place for photo-ops, and a time and a place to get things done. Hello, Congress? This current immigration crisis is less about who these child refugees from the drug wars are, and more about who we are as a nation -- a nation of immigrants. As Americans, we are proud that we are a country that people run to, not from. Our national symbol is not a Border Patrol guard with a gun. It's the Lady with the Lamp: . ""Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me."" In 2008, just before leaving office, President George W. Bush signed a law that Congress passed almost unanimously, requiring unaccompanied border-crossing minors from countries other than Canada and Mexico to have a fair hearing before an immigration judge. The American Civil Liberties Union and immigrant rights groups have filed a class-action lawsuit, trying to force the government to supply legal counsel for undocumented minors facing deportation. President Obama, rightly, is upholding the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act. His administration announced that it would prioritize the immigration cases of recent arrivals, particularly unaccompanied minors and families. The government will add and reassign immigration judges to focus on recently arrived children and families, whose cases would jump ahead of all the others in line. In addition, in a balanced approach, President Obama has asked for $3.7 billion to deal with the immediate crisis. Half the money will go to proper facilities for child refugees and more immigration judges. The other half will go to increased border security. Obama has a strong record on immigration enforcement, outdoing both Republican and Democratic predecessors. He has deported over 1 million immigrants, focusing on those with criminal records. As documented by many nonpartisan sources, by 2011 Obama had reduced illegal immigration crossings to net zero. He doubled the number of border guards from what they were in 2004. Indeed, Obama's Justice Department has been so aggressive in deportations, the City of Los Angeles refused to hold detainees past their release dates, as requested, citing constitutional protections. But Congress, rather than confront the immigration problem with a legislative solution or consider Obama's request for emergency funds, has jumped headfirst into the photo-op rabbit hole. Sadly, unless Congress acts, we will likely send most of the children back -- back to the drug-fueled gang violence from which they fled. In his request for emergency funds, Obama recognizes the dangerous, abusive conditions these children face in their Central American countries. He has designated some of the money to Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, where most of the children come from, to crack down on gang violence and support tougher penalties on smugglers. Money will also go to build better holding facilities for children. Meanwhile, the Washington Post reports that human rights organizations filed a complaint for 100 refugee children, saying they were denied necessities, including diapers, were subjected to racial insults, and were confined in ""squalid"" US detention centers. This ""do-nothing"" Congress needs to do something. These are children we're talking about. Congressional opposition to immigration reform or emergency funds doesn't stem from any philosophical objections or differences of principle. It stems from a calculated, petty, selfish rejection of anything Obama proposes. Four years ago, the President remarked, ""If I said the sky was blue, they'd say no. If I said fish live in the sea, they'd say no."" It's only gotten worse. It's time Congress channel the spirits of the late Senate Republican Leader Howard Baker and the late President Lyndon B. Johnson, both of whom practiced the art of bipartisanship, and to recall the saying from Scripture, ""Come let us reason together."" It's time Congress got spiritual, considering there's ""near universal"" religious support across our nation for Immigration Reform. Conservative Evangelicals, Protestant organizations across the spectrum, Catholics, and Jewish organizations have formed coalitions urging Congress to implement comprehensive Immigration Reform. They were shunned. Elie Wiesel once wrote, ""I swore never to be silent whenever and wherever human beings endure suffering and humiliation."" Why is Congress silent? Where, my fellow citizens, are our acts of goodness and kindness? For God's sake, these are children we're talking about.

"(CNN) -- Oh there been times that I thought I couldn't last for long . But now I think I'm able to carry on . It's been a long, a long time coming . But I know a change gonna come, oh yes it will. —Sam Cooke . While many Americans continue to live on the ""outskirts of hope,"" we still have reason to believe ""a change is gonna come."" President Ronald Reagan's snarky comment in 1987 that ""We waged war on poverty, and poverty won"" was inaccurate and inhumane. Poverty is different, less widespread, and much less prevalent among older Americans now than before Social Security. I know that from my own experience, my family's experience, and the experience of the people I grew up with. A recent study by Columbia University confirms that experience: Adjusted for inflation, poverty fell from about 26% in 1967 to 16% in 2012 as a result of anti-poverty government policies and support. Yet, at the same time, the share of earned income available is shrinking in the private sector. The end result is fewer poor because of government's safety nets, but more and more people living on the brink of poverty because they don't have access to the wealth from our recovering economy. Contrary to what some affluent, arrogant and ignorant pundits are saying, President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty had nothing to do with the expansion of welfare as we used to know it -- Aid to Families with Dependent Children. The major War on Poverty programs were about education, empowerment and the elderly — Head Start, student aid and Medicare, to name a few. Growing up around poor whites and Latinos in Texas, Johnson understood that poverty in America doesn't only have a black face. He launched the war on poverty in Appalachia, and later spoke movingly to Congress about the Mexican-American students whom he had taught as a very young man, saying: ""My students were poor and they often came to class without breakfast and hungry. And they knew even in their youth the pain of prejudice. They never seemed to know why people disliked them, but they knew it was so because I saw it in their eyes. ... And somehow you never forget what poverty and hatred can do when you see its scars on the hopeful face of a young child."" Fifty years later, in the photographs of Johnson talking with poor families in Appalachia, we see that he is really listening to them -- they are not strangers to each other. They aren't props for photo-ops. He has known these people all his life. And he never forgot where he came from. Marie Brookter, in her autobiography, ""Here I Am -- Take My Hand,"" tells how Lyndon Johnson sought her counsel on his civil rights and poverty programs. When she called Johnson, or left a message at the White House front gate, he promptly called her back. He was open, humble, and genuinely seeking guidance in attacking poverty. We have become bound by a political straitjacket that frames every debate: Too much federal government. Yet our forefathers forged this system for us. The federal government can accomplish what the states, acting alone or even in concert, cannot. Poverty is a national issue and needs a federal response. After all, U.S. federal government policies helped produce massive income inequality by lopsided breaks for the super wealthy. Since the '70s, government policies have driven the economic benefits that produced the biggest income gap between the top 1% and the bottom 90% since the Great Depression. For the first time in U.S. history, the bottom 90% earn less than 50% of the nation's income. Even the rich, 52% of them, tell pollsters the economic system favors the wealthy. The untold secret driving the obstruction to Obama's economic equality agenda is this: The opposition isn't really battling Big Government. The opposition is protecting an economic system that's putting more and more of the earned income out of reach for those aspiring to better themselves. Helping the poor doesn't mean redistributing the wealth. It means removing the breaks that give the wealthy an advantage so huge that big chunks of the nation's income are automatically removed from individual economic competition. We don't have to frame every debate as right vs. wrong, left vs. right. Adjusting a wayward economy's tilt to the wealthy shouldn't be an either-or, despite some pundits' delight in false dilemmas. Even the weather gets treated as ""I win-you lose."" The mentality that we can ""come together"" doesn't exist today. But there's nothing wrong about working to further reduce poverty, or giving all Americans a fair shot at working their way up. We, as a nation, have moral imperatives. We need to recognize that no one has all the answers. We need to agree that income inequality is a problem, that in the wealthiest nation on earth, people should not be both working and starving. We need government solutions. Members of Congress who obstruct our meeting the needs of the people need to return to their hometowns as private citizens. Trust me, ""A change is gonna come.""

"(CNN) -- Time has changed. In fact, most of the country just moved an hour forward. The time change coincides with the conclusion of the 2014 Conservative Political Action Conference, known as CPAC. The activists attending the conference are the Republican Party's shock troops, but some Republican strategists don't want them to shock mainstream voters this fall. Still, the gathering proved somewhat of a litmus test for a schizophrenic conservative base trying to figure out where it stands as the 2014 midterms approach, all the while struggling with change in a country that is changing quite rapidly. It tells you something that one of the biggest applause lines of CPAC wasn't even an applause line. It occurred when Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell held a rifle on stage. (The rifle was presented to Sen. Tom Coburn.) It also tells you something that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was invited to CPAC this year, now that he is embroiled in the Bridgegate scandal, but he was not invited last year, when he was on his way to re-election in a Democratic state. It seems like CPAC's test is whether you're making the right enemies. If the mainstream media is going after you, then CPAC will invite you. Christie's CPAC speech was directed to the conservative Republican base; he didn't talk beyond them, to a wider audience, as he did last year when he was running for re-election. He referred repeatedly to his anti-abortion positions. He attacked the news media and defended the Koch brothers. But in between the back-slapping and pontificating in the ballrooms and back rooms at CPAC, a new rift emerged inside the GOP. There appears to be a real division and a real debate in the Republican Party between the isolationists and the interventionists. In 1952, it was between Sen. Robert Taft and Gen. Dwight Eisenhower. That debate still isn't settled. In order for President Obama, Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden to be moderates, they just have to present themselves between the extremes of Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul's isolationism and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio's hawkishness—the difference between living in a cave or conducting ourselves so that we're in need of one. And, so far, the conservatives at the conference seemed to be picking up what Paul was laying down. In the annual CPAC straw poll, Paul appeared to be as popular as his father, former Rep. Ron Paul, was in 2010. Rand Paul won 31% of the votes this year (but history shows CPAC straw polls aren't always the best predictors of who will be nominated). Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who used his time before CPAC to imply that former Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole was unprincipled, got 11%. Rubio, who came in second in 2013, took a nosedive after recommending mild reform of immigration laws, and placed seventh with 6%. Cruz clearly displayed a tin ear and a lack of basic humanity by attacking ""President Bob Dole"" as a failed moderate nominee, now that Bob Dole, an American hero, is in his 90s and out of politics. Cruz is clearly running against the Washington Republican establishment. This strategy may serve him well until the point in the primaries when establishment figures like Karl Rove will unleash millions in negative commercials, the likes of which sank Newt Gingrich. Meanwhile, Texas Gov. Rick Perry gave a pulse-quickening speech that brought the crowd to its feet. Perry praised Republican governors and hit Washington, saying, ""It is time for Washington to focus on the few things the Constitution establishes as the federal government's role. ... Defend our country, provide a cogent foreign policy, and what the heck, deliver the mail, preferably on time and on Saturdays."" Perry may have forgotten that the Post Office has been independent of Congress since 1971 and is run, by law, as a ""revenue neutral"" (nonprofit) agency. He also apparently forgot the clauses ""insure domestic tranquility"" and ""promote for the general welfare."" Perry also ignored the duties of Congress, which is just as well. The third branch of government is, by political strategy, so gridlocked that it has all but ceased to function. Perry's emphasis on the role of governors underscores the political reality that mayors, governors and the President must engage in executive workarounds for this nonfunctioning Congress. The Republican Party has been struggling to attract minorities for decades. The party was trounced by the Democrats, who in 2012 got 93% of the African-American vote, 73% of the Asian vote and 71% of the Hispanic vote. CPAC held a panel discussion on minority outreach; a photo 10 minutes into the event embarrassingly showed row upon row upon row of empty chairs. The Republican Party did poorly in its outreach to female voters in 2012, who voted 55% for Obama and only 44% for Republican Mitt Romney. In 2014, at CPAC, attention to the ladies was also wanting. Los Angeles Times writer Robin Abcarian took a challenge from CPAC's chairman, Al Cardenas, to count the number of male and female speakers at CPAC. It came out lopsidedly for the men—by 78%. By definition, conservatives struggle with change. CPAC was proof of the old saying that ""the more things change, the more they stay the same."" Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.

"(CNN) -- Same-sex marriage in Alaska can move forward after the U.S. Supreme Court on Friday rejected the state's request to delay enforcement. The one-sentence order from the justices denying a stay means gays and lesbians could soon legally wed. Less than an hour later, a federal judge in Wyoming did the same in that Western state. Barring any continued legal intervention, that would make Alaska and Wyoming the 30th and 31st states to allow same-sex marriage, up from 19 states at the beginning of the month. In Alaska, a federal judge in the state in recent days had ordered gays and lesbians be allowed to apply for marriage licenses and to wed after a normal three-day waiting period. But everything was on hold pending emergency action from the justices. Some couples had begun applying for marriage licenses as early as Monday and in at least some cases, couples were married when they were granted expedited waivers. Alaska had requested a stay, saying it needed more time to file more detailed appeals to show its sovereign power to define marriage was being usurped by the courts. Officials, including the governor, had said waiting until the broader legal questions are resolved was best for all Alaskans. But a number of same-sex couples cited a federal appeals court ruling last week that struck down bans in Nevada and Idaho as unconstitutional. That appeals court's legal jurisdiction also includes Alaska and other Western states. Wyoming officials have not indicated whether they will appeal the ruling from federal Judge Scott Skavdahl. The judge said it was preferable the voters or the legislature decide such matters as defining marriage, but concluded ""that ship has sailed."" ""Binding precedent of [higher courts striking down similar bans] mandate this result, and this court will adhere to its constitutional duties and abide by the rule of law."" A federal appeals court in June became the first such judicial body to strike down same-sex marriage, in Utah and Oklahoma. That court also has jurisdiction over appeals in Wyoming, known as the Equality State. The Supreme Court later allowed those federal rulings to stand. Gay and lesbian couples could begin marrying on October 23, sooner if the state decides to drop any plans to appeal. The Wyoming case is Guzzo v. Mead (14-cv-200). The Alaska case is high court case is Parnell v. Hamby (14A413).","NEW: Federal judge rules same-sex marriage is legal in Wyoming .

"(CNN) -- Father's Day holds a unique place in America's culture. It was a bit of an afterthought, originating in 1910 -- some 40 years after Mother's Day -- after a woman in Spokane, Washington, campaigned that dads needed to be honored, too, . She was right. We couldn't possibly ignore Dad. We love him, too. He deserves more than second billing. Still, we all know Mother gets the most attention. She gets the perfume, she gets the flowers, she gets the candy, the new dress, the heart-felt cards and even breakfast in bed, (maybe). It's Dad who takes the kids and goes searching with them for Mother's Day presents. But Dad? Well, he gets a tie. Every year. Or maybe some T-shirts, golf balls, cologne, or a lounging shirt. A few joke greeting cards. Mom reminds the kids, and hands them a little money to shop with, saying, ""Get him something he'll enjoy."" Yeah, it will be a tie. Or, if he's lucky, his young ones may do a handmade gift. That ceramic cup that leans just slightly to the left. You know the one. Our public portrayal of fathers has shifted during my life. TV fathers have ""evolved' from real people like Sheriff Andy Taylor, Beaver's dad Ward Cleaver and Heathcliff ""Cliff"" Huxtable, to cartoon dads like Homer Simpson, and Seth MacFarlane's caricatures in ""American Dad!"" and ""Family Guy."" None of the latter are exactly the firm, wise, wisdom-dispensing fathers of the ""back-in-the-day"" TV dads. But my dad was the real deal. He was a veteran. And he never allowed his nine kids to forget. Today's fathers are having a rough go being kindly portrayed in the media. Thank God, we do we have President Barack Obama for a national model. He both dotes on and takes a firm loving hand to our first-family daughters. And every once in a while, he gets to parent a ""son."" I recall his having a sort of father-son talk with a crying boy who'd lost an egg at the White House Easter Egg roll, telling him -- like a father -- to ""shake it off."" I also recall the President saying on TV, with Michelle sitting right beside him, (foolish man) that he put more thought into his gifts, than he got back -- producing a very frosty look from the first lady. But, it was probably true. It was in my family. There are, of course, instances of bad fathers, men who weren't up to the job. Those who abandoned their kids, or were often drunk. Those who were present with necessities, yet absent from their children's lives. God bless them for missing out on the most rewarding parts of being a male, and God bless their kids for surviving and maturing in spite of this. President Obama knows about this -- he was raised largely without his father -- as does Bill Clinton, whose father died three months before the 42nd president was born. It's true you never know the full depth of a parent's touch in your life until they're gone. Even if you cared for them in their old age, there's never a way to prepare yourself for the death of a parent. If you're a girl, you're always Daddy's little girl. You're vulnerable, no matter how worldly, or sophisticated, or strong you'd become along the way. My dad, Lionel, let me know how proud he was, even as he kept me from being too big for my britches. My father would have celebrated his 83rd birthday this weekend. It's been two years since his death, but I think of him every day. Lionel loved sports, he enjoyed cooking and loved his family. And most of all, he devoted most of his life to trying to help others. On this Father's Day, I think of my Dad, my grandfathers, uncles and my two brothers who are good dads to their kids. I also think of all the fathers whose sons were taken in service to this nation. Lionel would approve of that. I think of the fathers of the boys and girls killed in Sandy Hook, and 74 school shootings since then. I think of all the fathers who've lost daughters and sons to illnesses, or accidents -- far too often a father's only child. I also think of the fathers whose sons turned mass murderers, despite every effort to parent a son who'd make a good citizen. There can't be a worse hell on earth than that. Then, I turn my prayers and attention back to the fathers still parenting. I think and pray for the fathers across the nation who are raising America's next generation, and of those still advising the current, grown up, generations. There's no more important job in the world than raising a child, even when you're the President. There's no more important job than being a father.

"(CNN) -- France is facing fines and penalties after Europe's highest court found the government has failed to do enough to protect its hamsters. In a case that stretches back three years, the European Court of Justice said Thursday that the French government hasn't adequately conserved the remaining few hundred Great Hamsters of Alsace still living in a small enclave in eastern France. ""The court finds that the measures implemented by France in 2008 were not adequate to enable effective avoidance of deterioration or destruction of the breeding sites and resting places of the European Hamster,"" the ECJ said in a statement. The little 10-inch rodents are considered pests by farmers there, and were trapped, poisoned almost out of existence by the early 1990s when they got official protection. But as the last surviving example of hamster left in western Europe, the court says they deserve better protection in line with the suit by European Commission regulators. ""The commission complains that in 2008, France failed to take adequate measures to ensure strict protection of the European Hamster in Alsace (France), the only region where it is present,"" the court said. The hamster is at risk of extinction as a result of harmful agricultural practices and urbanization, which disturb its breeding and resting places, according to the court. Changing farming practices combined with encroaching building and urbanization in recent decades have led to the destruction of nearly all their burrows along the rivers there, leading to a population collapse. The commission said the switch to summer-ripening maize in many farms had further harmed the population because when the white-pawed, black-bellied hamsters wake up from hibernation in the spring, there's no seed to eat. And while the court praised a move to grow winter crops and alfalfa that the hamsters like to munch on, it found that the government-backed moves were too little and too late. There are only about 800 of the animals still alive, but that's several times more than were alive just a few years ago. Still, the court determined that there had to be nearly twice the current number of the little creatures to sustain their population. The French Ministry of Agriculture was not immediately available for comment.","Court says France has neglected its 10-inch rodent citizens .

"(CNN) -- In her 1976 keynote address to the Democratic National Committee, Texas Rep. Barbara Jordan said words I will never forget: . ""We believe that the people are the source of all governmental power; that the authority of the people is to be extended, not restricted. This can be accomplished only by providing each citizen with every opportunity to participate in the management of the government. ""We believe that the government which represents the authority of all the people, not just one interest group, but all the people, has an obligation to actively seek to remove those obstacles which would block individual achievement -- obstacles emanating from race, sex, economic condition."" That explains why I am a Democrat. Beyond that, ensuring every American's right to vote and working to get out the vote -- every vote, regardless of party -- has been a lifelong goal, a personal quest. Today, unfortunately, the right to vote seems to have become a partisan issue. Democrats seek to guarantee and expand voting rights. Republicans try to undermine and suppress voting rights. It wasn't always this way. In 1965 when President Johnson realized that the previous year's Civil Rights Act was not enough, that the country needed a Voting Rights Act to protect the rights of citizens -- particularly blacks and minorities -- he called on the minority leader, Republican Sen. Everett Dirksen of Illinois, for help. Clinton helps launch push against voter 'restrictions' Dirksen responded, and the bill passed. His words remain relevant: ""The right to vote is still an issue in this free country. There has to be a real remedy. This cannot go on forever, this denial of the right to vote by ruses and devices and tests and whatever the mind can contrive to either make it very difficult or to make it impossible to vote."" We agree. That is why I am proud to be launching the Democratic National Committee's new initiative -- the Voter Expansion Project -- where we are taking action to expand voting opportunities for all. We're moving beyond simply protecting the vote and becoming the leader in expanding the vote. The Voter Expansion Project's mission is clear: Ensure that every eligible citizen can register, every registered voter can vote, and every vote is accurately counted. Let me repeat that -- our mission is to ensure that every eligible citizen can register, every registered voter can vote, and every vote is accurately counted. I believe in the marketplace of ideas. I also believe that every citizen should have equal access -- through their voice and their vote. Today, too many Republicans are making it harder for working Americans, students, women, people of color and the elderly to participate in the process. In states like Ohio, North Carolina, Florida, Texas, Wisconsin and many others, we see Republican-controlled legislatures engaged in voter suppression efforts, such as curtailing early voting, requiring restrictive IDs, etc. That's not the American way. As Ronald Reagan said, ""For this nation to remain true to its principles, we cannot allow any American's vote to be denied, diluted or defiled. The right to vote is the crown jewel of American liberties, and we will not see its luster diminished."" So as an American, I invite Independents and, yes, Republicans to join us. In fact, I ask my Republican friends -- and adversaries -- to answer Dirksen's challenge -- ""How then shall there be government by the people if some of the people cannot speak?"" Answer it as he did -- by working for the people, by trusting the people -- all the people. But let me also be clear: As a Democrat and as an American, I don't believe we can wait. I am committed to the Voter Expansion Project because it will expand the vote by creating more access, engage more voters, protect the vote by breaking down barriers, demystify the process and make sure every vote is counted. More specifically, the Voter Expansion Project has four main goals: . 1. Voter education -- train campaign staff, volunteers and voters about the rules and regulations in order to demystify the voting experience . 2. Election administration -- work closely with election administrators to ensure they have the training and resources to conduct a fair election . 3. Legislation -- advocate for laws that improve the voting experience and increase participation . 4. Litigation -- fight laws that make registering to vote and casting a ballot more difficult to decrease participation . We will work with any group that helps further those goals. In addition, the Voter Expansion Project will, on a state-by-state basis, provide a network of voter advocates and a hub of information and best practices. It will provide consulting and advice to individuals and voter advocacy groups. It will also prepare tools and reports that will provide resources for expanding the vote. Finally, it will prepare a ""Voter Bill of Rights."" Yes, the Voter Expansion Project is an initiative of the Democratic National Committee. Yes, it will utilize the DNC's experience in voter protection and its resources for voter advocacy. But every citizen and every civic and political group should be on board with the Voter Expansion Project. Lyndon Johnson, a Texas Democrat, and Everett Dirksen, an Illinois Republican, recognized that expanding the vote benefited both parties and the country. They worked together for that. So should we.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The Watergate Hotel, part of a complex that became synonymous with President Richard Nixon's downfall, attracted no bids at an auction Tuesday. The Watergate Hotel will most likely have to be sold privately after not attracting bids at auction. According to Paul Cooper, vice president of Alex Cooper Auctioneers, some 10 bidders ready to provide a $1 million deposit were registered for the auction. But the hotel fell back into the hands of its lender, PB Capital, after no one advanced the $25 million opening bid, the auction company said. The auction was sponsored by PB Capital, which holds a $40 million note on the hotel after the previous owner, Monument Reality, defaulted on its loan. Monument's 30-day foreclosure note expired Thursday. Cooper said PB Capital will most likely sell the hotel privately after it takes over the title and will not try to operate the hotel itself. On the night of June 17, 1972, the hotel served as a base for an illegal break-in by operatives of the Nixon re-election campaign at the offices of the Democratic National Committee, located in the Watergate office building next door. Some of the burglars and their handlers, whose arrests began the investigation that led, two years later, to Nixon's resignation, actually stayed at the Watergate hotel prior to the break-in. Among the hotel guests were former FBI agent G. Gordon Liddy, and former CIA operative Howard Hunt, both of whom later served prison time as a result of the Watergate break-in. Developers estimate the hotel could need up to $100 million in renovations. The Watergate complex was built in the late 1960s and consists of the hotel, two office buildings, and three apartment buildings. Only the hotel building was up for auction Tuesday. It closed two years ago for renovations, and possible conversions into co-op apartments.","Hotel falls back into the hands of its lender, PB Capital .

"(CNN) -- UBS announced Thursday that rogue trading by one of its investment bank traders had cost the Swiss banking giant a staggering $2 billion. But while the loss would potentially be among the largest costs ever to a bank in unauthorized trading, it is far from the first. The UBS scandal revealed Thursday is the latest in a long list of unauthorized trades that have cost banks billions of dollars. From foreign currency trading to speculating on futures derivatives, a number of individual rogue traders have destabilized and even caused the collapse of their banks through unauthorized trades in the past twenty years alone. Jerome Kerviel -- $6 billion, Societe Generale . In January 2008, French trader Kerviel was arrested in Paris and accused of committing massive fraud that cost Societe Generale Bank nearly $6 billion. Kerviel was involved in the practice of arbitrage at the bank, buying a portfolio of financial instruments -- European index futures in Kerviel's case -- in one market and selling a similar offsetting portfolio at the same time with a different value in order to minimize risk. Kerviel's offsetting portfolio, however, was ""fictitious,"" according to the bank, meaning Kerviel had in effect made an unhedged bet of a staggering $60 billion of Societe Generale's money on European futures without the bank's knowledge -- a bet that end up costing the bank roughly $6 billion. 33-year-old Kerviel, who was sentenced to three years in prison last year, insisted he wasn't the only one doing this and that his bosses knew of and condoned his behavior while at the bank. ""During three years these managers earned colossal amounts of money out of bonuses based on the ever growing results that I was making for the bank,"" he said. Yasuo Hamanaka -- $2.6 billion, Sumitomo Corporation . Hamanaka was sent to prison for eight years in 1997 for fraud and forgery in the global copper market. The copper trader's unauthorized deals ended up costing Japan's Sumitomo Corporation $2.6 billion. Nicknamed ""Mr. Five Percent"" in reference to the amount of the global copper market he was once estimated to control, Hamanaka was accused for years of price-fixing in order to generate exorbitant profits for Sumitomo. The one-time king of the copper market would have Sumitomo buy huge quantities of copper and store it for awhile in order to create an artificial shortage of the precious metal, thus driving up demand, before releasing smaller amounts of copper on commodities markets at extremely high prices. The decade-long scheme fell apart in 1996, and in 1998 Sumitomo paid $150 million to regulators while refusing to admit or deny if the corporation knew about or condoned the actions of its rogue trader. Nick Leeson -- $1.3 billion, Barings Bank . The British trader's losses of over a billion dollars singlehandedly brought down Barings Bank, the former personal bank to Britain's Queen, in 1995. At first Leeson, a star trader in Barings' Singapore branch, made huge profits in the early nineties by speculating on futures derivatives for the bank. A loophole in Barings' oversight system allowed Leeson to settle his own deals, meaning he could set up fake accounts for non-existent clients -- and as his luck began to run out, this is precisely what he did, masking huge losses by placing them in a single secret account while making increasingly risky bets in an attempt to recoup the losses. In January 1995, Leeson bet that the Japanese Nikkei index would rise after performing poorly the previous year, but his timing could not have been worse -- the Kobe earthquake on January 17th, the worst in Japan in 70 years, sent stock prices plummeting. His big bet having failed, Leeson attempted to flee back to the UK but was arrested and extradited back to Singapore, where he was sentenced to six and a half years in prison for financial misrepresentation. He served three before being released. The $1.3 billion in liabilities Leeson ran up wiped out 233-year-old Barings' capital and reserves, and the bank collapsed. John Rusnak -- $700 million, Allfirst / Allied Irish Bank . In February 2002, AIB executives called the FBI after discovering that both roughly $700 million and 37-year-old trader John Rusnak had gone missing from work. Working for AIB's Allfirst subsidiary in Baltimore, Maryland since 1993, the foreign currency trader worked under the radar for nearly a decade, betting mostly on the price of the Japanese yen and racking up hundreds of millions of dollars in small losses that he attempted to hide in fabricated options contracts. Part of the reason Rusnak was able to perpetrate such massive fraud was poor supervision and financial controls at AIB -- although Rusnak's trading limit was $2.5 million, by 2002 he was betting up to $7.5 billion (3,000 times his limit) of AIB's money on currency movements, according to the Financial Times. AIB sold its scandal-hit Allfirst subsidiary in late 2002, and Rusnak served over seven years in prison.","Jerome Kerviel cost Societe Generale $6 billion in unauthorized trading by 2008 .

"(CNN) -- American journalist Michael Scott Moore, held for more than two years by Somali pirates, has been freed, Moore's family and a Somali official told CNN on Tuesday. ""We are just elated,"" Marlis Saunders, Moore's mother, said in a brief conversation. ""It took a lot of work for us to get this point. And to hear he is free -- just joyful, I can't describe it."" ""All this is just so new,"" said Saunders, who lives in Redondo Beach, California. ""I did not have much time to talk with him. We just have a lot of things to do and I cannot talk anymore. We need a little time to evaluate all this."" The governor of Somalia's Mudug region, Ahmed Muse, told CNN that local elders negotiated Moore's release, adding that the journalist is ""physically and mentally"" worn out. Moore boarded a plane at an airport in Galkayo, in the north-central part of Somalia, Muse said. Muse would not say where the journalist is headed. ""I'm absolutely thrilled,"" said Michel Todd, who was Moore's web editor at Pacific Standard magazine. ""It's like seeing somebody come back from the dead. It's a marvelous resurrection."" Todd said Moore was a weekly freelance columnist who wrote often about Somalia. He had been researching Somali pirates. ""As a news organization, we wanted to write about his capture,"" Todd said. ""But we had been encouraged by the FBI and State Department to (not) write about it because this would hurt his cause. They said, if you really care about the guy, that is not a good idea, raising his profile would make his release more difficult."" Todd said Moore's stories suggested that illegal European fishing was driving Somalis into piracy. ""Of all the people for the pirates to nab,"" he said. ""He wasn't necessarily a spokesman, but he was someone who was more amenable to getting (the pirates') point across. I'm not saying he was pro-pirate, but he was pro-truth and that seemed like something that might have been helpful to Somalis."" Maria Streshinsky, editor of Pacific Standard, said, ""We are thrilled, but it has been really far too long. It's been such a worrisome situation. We are just elated. We may have a toast and a beer in his honor. I hope he is healthy."" Pacific Standard is a publication of the Miller-McCune Center for Research, Media and Public Policy, a California-based nonprofit. PSmag.com claims to reach nearly one million readers each month with research-based articles about the social sciences, . Moore's mother declined to comment when asked if a ransom was paid for her son. Muse said he did not know if a ransom was paid. In lawless Somalia, it's common -- particularly among pirates -- that people are kidnapped and their freedom negotiated for ransom. The pirates operate in the Gulf of Aden, one of the globe's most trafficked shipping waterways. The U.S. State Department confirmed in January 2012 that officials had spoken with Moore's family and been in touch with contacts in Kenya and Somalia to get more information. The department noted at the time that a travel warning for Somalia cautioned U.S. citizens of the risks of traveling to the country and recommended avoiding it. Freed journalist Peter Theo Curtis back in the U.S. CNN's Ray Sanchez and journalist Mohamed Sheikh Nor in Somalia contributed to this report.","Mother of journalist confirms son's release: ""We are elated,"" she tells CNN .

"(CNN) -- Free agent quarterback Peyton Manning will play for the Denver Broncos, the team announced Tuesday. ""This is truly a special football environment, and I'm glad to be a part of it,"" Manning said at a news conference where the Broncos made the announcement. ""I haven't had a whole lot of time to breathe. This happened Monday morning,"" Manning said of his decision to join the Broncos. He said he talked to a number of NFL teams before agreeing to a contract with Denver. ""I'm proud to be a Denver Bronco,"" he said. ""It felt strange being in a new locker room. I haven't been anywhere else,"" said the quarterback. Manning was released earlier this year by the Indianapolis Colts, the only team for which he's played in his 14-year pro career. In the subsequent weeks, the Super Bowl XLI victor -- who has been named the National Football League's Most Valuable Player a record four times -- has been hotly sought after by several teams. He did not play during the 2011 season after having surgery to repair a neck injury, and he ended his career with the Colts this month in an emotional news conference. Break it down: What Peyton Manning can do . Broncos executive John Elway, also a Hall of Fame quarterback for the Broncos, said the team was satisfied with Manning's health and his ability to make the team competitive for a championship. ""We believe he can play as long as he wants,"" Elway said of Manning's health. ""I don't consider it much of a risk knowing Peyton Manning."" The arrival in Denver of a superstar of Manning's stature raised questions about the fate of Tim Tebow, who became the Broncos starting quarterback last year amid electric fanfare and led the team into the playoffs. Tebow won the Heisman Trophy in 2007, when he played for the University of Florida. Manning said he would be a good teammate to Tebow, but Manning understood if Tebow pursued opportunities at other teams. SI's Peter King: Broncos would be smart to keep Tebow . Elway, the team's executive vice president for football operations, didn't reveal Tebow's future status at the Broncos. ""Tim Tebow is a great kid. If I want someone to marry my daughter, it's him,"" Elway said. ""To his fans, I would say this: That's the tough part of this business,"" Elway said. ""I've got to make the best decisions I can for the Denver Broncos. ""The personal side of this business is always tough,"" Elway said. ""It's also a business where we're expected to win."" But Elway added: ""Any time you got a player like Peyton Manning on your team, you've got a chance to win."" Manning will continue to wear No. 18 as he had for the 14 years he was at the Colts, but the Broncos will need to un-retire that jersey number, which belonged to quarterback Frank Tripucka, an original Bronco. On the Broncos team website, Tripucka said in a statement that he spoke with Manning on the phone Tuesday morning. ""I had the privilege of speaking with Peyton Manning this morning, and I let him know that I would be honored if he wore No. 18 for the Denver Broncos,"" Tripucka said. ""I have admired Peyton for a long time. He is one of the all-time greats, and having him wear the same jersey that I did brings me a lot of joy. I can't wait to see him in No. 18."" Jim Irsay, the Colts' owner and chief executive officer, said in a statement Tuesday morning he congratulates Manning ""as he heads to a tremendous organization in the Denver Broncos. We wish him nothing but the best as he continues his Hall of Fame career."" On Monday, indications were the Broncos were the only ones negotiating with Manning, deflating several other teams. The Miami Dolphins, Washington Redskins, San Francisco 49ers, Tennessee Titans and Arizona Cardinals were said to be among the others interested in signing Manning. Several Denver Broncos players expressed excitement Monday that Manning had picked their team to join. Running back Lance Ball wrote ""Wow!"" on his Twitter feed, while offensive lineman Ryan Clady tweeted, ""Yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" ""It makes you think big,"" linebacker Robert Ayers told reporters. ""If you look at (it) historically, the teams that won the Super Bowl are teams with a guy like Ben Roethlisberger and Drew Brees and Eli (Manning) and Aaron Rodgers and all those guys. So it definitely makes you confident."" Linebacker Joe Mays, who officially signed again with the Broncos on Monday, told CNN affiliate KMGH, ""We're definitely going to go for that Super Bowl ring, and we're going to do whatever it takes. We've got the man at quarterback to play for us."" Titans owner K.S. ""Bud"" Adams said in a statement that he spoke with Manning on Monday morning. ""I want to thank the whole organization for their efforts in trying to sign Peyton and also to Peyton for the time he put into the process,"" he said. ""Peyton called me this morning to inform me of his decision and obviously I am disappointed, because I thought we would be a perfect fit.""","NEW: Fate of last year's popular Bronco QB Tim Tebow is uncertain .

"Editor's note: CNN.com has a business partnership with CareerBuilder.com, which serves as the exclusive provider of job listings and services to CNN.com. You can sell your skills, your time or your used stuff to make some extra money. With an abundance of job losses, salary cuts, eliminated bonuses and diminished 401(K) matching contributions, your income is shrinking -- but the bills aren't. If your regular job isn't earning you enough cash or you've lost your job altogether, these simple side gigs can help put some padding in your pockets until -- maybe even after -- you get back on your feet. Here are 10 ways real people are creatively taking home some extra dough: . 1. Do freelance work . Felice Premeau Devine left her lucrative, full-time job two years ago to raise her son. In the interim, she's picked up writing and editing freelance work and started a blog, where she is able to earn a little cash from advertising. Nowadays, almost any job can be done on a contract or freelance basis. Check out sites like Sologig, which lead job seekers to contract, consulting, freelance, temp-to-hire and part-time project opportunities in your field. 2. Sell your books . If you're a college student or you hung on to your college textbooks thinking you might want to read them again somewhere down the line, select retailers like Barnes & Noble allow you to sell your textbooks for some quick cash. Or, take some classics from your personal library and sell them at a local second-hand bookstore. 3. Search circulating coinage . Susan Headley, the ""guide to coins"" on About.com, is a lifetime coin collector who has been boosting her income by searching through circulating coinage for the past six years. In 2008, she made about $2,500 and so far in 2009, she has earned approximately $500 from coins she's found. People who search circulating coinage successfully for a side income do so in very large numbers, she says. They buy rolls of coins from banks, typically in whole boxes, and sort through it to find stuff that just doesn't belong, Headley says. Half dollars, for example, were no longer made from 90 percent silver after 1965, but they still had 40 percent silver in them until 1970; either of these turn a nice profit. Presidential dollar errors can be worth $50 to $5,000 each; uncirculated state quarters can sell from $10 to $50 per roll; and rare error coins can value up to $35,000. 4. Start a ""business"" Turn your hobby, skills or expertise into a part-time business. Sites like Jobvana can help you do so by providing you with free tools to market your services and offer specialized skills to those looking for help. Peter Olson says he built a profile in September 2008 offering to teach guitar lessons. He has since gained two students, earning about $240 extra dollars per month and grossing around $1,000 since he started teaching. 5. Enter local and online sweepstakes . Wendy Limauge has been entering sweepstakes since 1993 and teaching others to win through her Web site, Sweeties Sweeps, since 2002. Though winning sweepstakes rarely provides actual cash, her winnings have consistently provided her and her family with 200 to 300 prizes a year, many of them large items she and her husband couldn't afford on their incomes alone. Prizes she has won include three TVs, two of which are flat-screens; a home theatre system; three dishwashers, each won on separate occasions; at least $1,500 in grocery gift certificates; an $18,000 voucher for the vehicle of her choice; a trip to France valued at $25,000; and, in March 2009, she won $5,000 in an instant-win game. ""The Internet has so many options for saving money, getting something for free, winning a prize or earning money from home,"" Limauge says. ""You just need to find those resources that offer helpful information and point you in the right direction to get you started and keep you motivated."" 6. Give your opinion -- and get paid . Linda Childers, a California-based freelance writer, says many of her friends participate in focus groups. Contributing an hour of your time can earn you up to $100, sometimes more. Online surveys, phone surveys and product trials can also earn you anywhere from $5 to $150. Check out Free Paid Surveys or FindFocusGroups. 7. Sell your junk . Terri Jay earns $2,000 - $3,000 per month just by selling junk. On eBay, Jay not only sells stuff she isn't using; she hits up local thrift stores on 99-cent days, garage sales and tack sales, looking for things of which she knows the value. She says her best sale was for a drink tray from the 70s: She paid 25 cents for it and it sold for $87. ""The trick is to [sell] what you know,"" she advises. ""Therefore you can list them [at correct prices] so they will get picked up in searches [on eBay]."" 8. Join a direct selling company . Direct selling is one of the easiest ways to earn some extra cash, especially if you sell products you love. Avon, for example, allows you start your own business for $10 -- your take home depends on your efforts. Some full-time representatives earn six-figure salaries, others own licensed Avon Beauty Centers and many just sell Avon part time around their family's schedules. Haizel MacIntyre started her Avon business in June of 2008 to earn supplemental income to her full-time job when her husband was laid off. Since joining Avon, MacIntyre averages $1,800 a month in sales and her husband is helping her run the business. Her Avon earnings help pay the bills, provide extras for her three kids and she is hoping to earn enough to put towards her college tuition when she goes back to school to get her Masters in Social Work. 9. Be a secret shopper . Keen eyes for detail as well as a good memory are really all that it takes to succeed as a secret shopper, says Zippy Sandler, who has been mystery shopping for about 13 years. After registering with a secret shopping company, you are paid to basically go undercover and report on a company's operation from the customer point of view. Sandler decided to start secret shopping not only to earn money eating, traveling and shopping, but also to learn customer service skills to pass along to the employees she managed at a retail store. Depending on the clients she is shopping for, Sandler says she has earned everywhere from $100 to $2,000 per month. 10. Sell your photos to stock agencies . It doesn't matter if you're a hobbyist, an amateur or a seasoned photographer - anyone can submit their photos to stock photo agencies like Shutterstock.com. If your images are accepted, they will be available for download by subscribers. Each time someone downloads your photos, you get 25 cents. Copyright CareerBuilder.com 2009. All rights reserved.

"(CNN) -- Small waves lap at the hulls of the ocean-going container ships as they approach the South African Port of Ngqura. Some of these large boats have come from as far away as South America, and the shelter of Nelson Mandela Bay is a relief after the Atlantic Ocean swells. The vessels are met by Dave Keller, who's been working these waters off the country's Eastern Cape Province since 2010. ""As a pilot it's my job to take over from the captain when a captain gets close to the port,"" he explains. ""It's my job to navigate him safely into the port, maneuver his vessel and then safely put it alongside the quayside."" This welcoming procedure guides ships into the province's newest port, which is also a multi-billion dollar industrial park that's growing faster than anyone expected. It's this combination of maritime port and landside infrastructure just outside the city of Port Elizabeth that is making the operation boom. ""We started off with nothing,"" Keller recalls. ""People said that this will be a white elephant and that this will never be busy,"" he adds. ""We started off in October 2010 ... and from there on it's grown -- from one ship a week, sometimes we do between five and 10 ships a day now,"" he continues. ""We're 24 hours a day, so since the past four or five years that I've been here it's been growing every single week."" One reason not everyone was excited with the construction of Ngqura was that there were already seven other ports in operation in the country, whereas one of the stated aims of the authorities is to ""minimize duplications"" between shipping facilities. And even though approximately 96% of the country's exports are being conveyed by sea, some of these ports aren't performing as well as some regional competitors. Transnet, the wholly state-owned freight business, is trying to improve the port sector by investing in cranes to move containers from ships to shore more efficiently. But a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers blames ""comparatively high tariffs payable by vessels calling at South African ports"" for the decline in shipping business. But these issues haven't stopped Ngqura from becoming the fastest growing terminal in the world in February 2013, according to Drewry Maritime Research. And now the port is the third busiest in the country, only moving fewer containers than Cape Town and Durban according to the Institute of Shipping Economics and Logistics. 'Driving development' And it's not just the port that is seeing growth in the area. The on land set-up, with tax incentives, rebates and a duty-free zone at the state-owned Coega Industrial Development Zone is changing the local economy. ""The Coega industrial development zone has a very important role to play in the economic growth of the area,"" says Christopher Mashigo, business development executive manager at the Coega Development Corporation. ""It is a strategic driver of development, firstly by bringing about a level of diversification in the regional economy to reduce it's over dependence on the automotive sector, as well as agri-processing. But also to help increase the region's ability to absorb its vast human resources."" The industrial zone created more than 13,000 jobs last year. A further 13,000 people received training there. One person to benefit from new skills is Wandumzi Nkonyeni who learned how to drive and is now a driving instructor. ""Coega is a key role player as far as transforming the economy of the Eastern Cape,"" he says. ""The opportunities that come, strictly for employment, never mind big business, but just employing the ordinary person out there."" As well as individuals gaining skills and jobs, small and medium size businesses in the area are also benefiting from the zone. The Coega development corporation helped local design and advertising firm XSpark get their BEE Certificate -- an accreditation that helps the business bid for work in South Africa. Another local business that is seeing growth is Miya's Electrical, and it's Coega that makes up 40% of their annual revenue. ""Coega is very good for the business and for the province as well,"" explains Ntsikelelo Suwankazi, the company's General Manager. ""Up to this far even other companies, they're flocking to the Eastern Cape and mainly because Coega is heading most of the projects here in the Eastern Cape and then it has helped our business to grow as well. We started with 3 employees, we've got 20 employees now."" The port is allowing some small business owners to grow their existing operation, but it's also leading to the beginnings of totally new businesses. Lusanda Nala is a painting apprentice who'll be a qualified artisan in three years. ""I want to open my own company because there's a shortage of artisan, especially in painting,"" she explains. ""Also there's no women that is an artisan in painting, so hopefully I'll be the first."" While some of these successes prove the value of the port and industrial zone, there is much more to come. Transnet's long-term plan for Ngqura includes increasing the total number of berths to more than 30, and boosting the port's capacity to 1.5 million containers per year. If it reaches that goal, the port would be nearly twice as busy as it is now. As the port expands, watery waves will continue lapping at the ship's hulls and businesses hope they will see continued waves of growth in the local economy.

"Tam Dao National Park, Vietnam (CNN) -- As a hangover ""cure,"" they don't come more brutally disturbing than bear bile. Extracted from the animal with a long needle inserted into the gall bladder on illegal bear farms in Vietnam and China, the endangered Asiatic black bear -- also known as Moon Bears because of the crescent of white fur on their chest - is subjected to a slow death from infection and disease in tiny cages that restrict their movements. ""In Vietnam, men in particular mix bear bile with rice wine because they believe it makes them stronger and able to drink more,"" says Tuan Bendixsen, Vietnam director of Animals Asia, an animal welfare group. ""It's been used in traditional medicine for thousands of years and there are claims that it can cure everything from hangovers, liver cirrhosis to cancer,"" he says. ""People mix it with alcohol and rub it on their skin to reduce swelling. To that extent, we acknowledge that it does work, but there are alternatives; cortisone, for example, or even Dencorub."" Last month, the animal welfare group marked a coup in its fight against bear farming. For the first time in Vietnam, a bear farmer acted on conscience, voluntarily surrendering his share of a bear farm -- with its 14 bears -- without asking for compensation. ""If he wanted to sell his share, he could have easily done it underground on the black market, but he'd seen the work we've done and approached us,"" says Bendixsen. ""It's the first time that's happened with such a large number of bears."" At the group's Moon Bear rescue centre in the Tam Dao National Park, 43 miles (70km) north of Hanoi, chief vet Kirsty Officer said the decision by bear farmer Nguyen Ngoc Tien to relinquish his share voluntarily was an important development. ""Now that we've had one person doing this we are hoping it will lead the way for others to follow the example,"" says Officer. In the sanctuary's temporary quarantine cages, where the 14 new arrivals will be slowly rehabilitated over three months before joining the 98 other bears that live permanently at the 30-acre site in Chat Dau Valley, the animals show signs of their recent trauma. Some pace the cages, another is bald from rubbing its head repetitively against the bars, several have missing limbs -- a sign they were snared in the wild. ""This stereotypical behavior is a sign they are bored out of their brains,"" says Officer. ""There's been nothing for them on the bear farm to express their natural bear behaviors, so they replace them with these very unnatural behaviors."" In many cases, the bears need immediate medical attention, Officer explains, including the removal of their gall bladders and other organs damaged by the bile extraction process. The bile extraction process, she says, differs from country to country. In China, the bears are housed in coffin-sized ""crush cages"" to prevent the animal moving, making it easier and safer for an operator to insert a catheter, and in some cases to simply suture the organ to an opening in the abdomen so the bile can be drained continuously into a collecting tray. In Vietnam, however, the animal is sedated -- sometimes using illegal street ketamine -- taken into the open and a four-inch needle inserted into its abdomen and the bile drawn out. The non-sterile conditions can quickly lead to infection, a situation which not only endangers the bear but also bile users. Bile samples have shown contamination with everything from cancer cells to pus. Some users, says Animals Asia, have become seriously ill from using it. ""There have been some recent cases of people being poisoned by bear bile,"" says Bendixsen. ""A few months ago, we heard of a case of 76-year-old man who swallowed bear bile to help him get over injuries from a fall. ""Within half an hour his body was heating up, a shower didn't help him cool down and within two days he was in hospital with a severe reaction to the bile. His body was covered in red spots and his skin was peeling. It was a severe allergic reaction."" He said reported cases such as this have helped his group's campaign to end bear bile farming but there was still a long way to go, especially since extracted bile is expensive and sometimes gains cachet as a status symbol among Asia's nouveau riche. How much the illegal trade in bear bile is worth is still difficult to estimate. ""It's hard to say because it's illegal,"" says Bendixsen. ""But two years ago the police raided a farm in Halong Bay and they confiscated all the records which provided valuable information on the trade. ""From the records we could see that the farm had sold 80,000ml of bear bile in six months at between US$6 and US$30 per milliliter -- that's at least $500,000 from one bear farm alone."" While it's illegal to harvest and sell bear bile in Vietnam, it's not illegal to keep bears if they have been in captivity before 2005. Animals Asia says there are 3,567 bears held on farms throughout Vietnam, but a lack of enforcement means the trade continues. As many as 7,000 bears are believed to be farmed in neighboring China, with farms also known to exist in Laos, Myanmar and the Republic of Korea. The Chinese government has previously defended the practice, saying that farming protects wild bears which would otherwise be killed and harvested for their whole gall bladders, where the bile is stored. The argument is widely disputed by animal welfare groups who say farmed bile puts pressure on captive and wild populations alike. Animals Asia estimates that wild Asiatic bears in Vietnam could now number in the hundreds and there are worrying signs that poachers are moving into the forests of neighboring Laos where the bears may be more plentiful. Little is known about the animal in the wild and remaining numbers worldwide are estimated at anywhere between 16,000 and 50,000. Animals Asia says it has reached an agreement with the Vietnamese government to eventually keep 200 bears at its center, but the group admits its work is only a band aid when put against scale of the problem of illegal trapping and farming. Their best hope, says bear manager at the Moon Bear rescue center Falk Wicker, is to educate a new generation about the dangers of bear bile remedies. ""In Vietnam, especially, these remedies are not thousands of years old at all, they've been imported from China much more recently,"" he says. ""In Vietnam, it has much more to do with new wealth and with status."" The active ingredient in bear bile -- ursodeoxycholic acid, or UDCA, which does have anti-inflammatory properties -- can be produced in a laboratory. The problem, says Falk, is that most bear bile is used in quack cures and folk remedies. ""It's the problem with many traditional remedies. People are told it cures cancer, then the thinking is if it cures cancer, then it must be good to have a shot of it every now and then,"" Officer adds. ""The myths just keep being perpetuated."" For the workers at Animals Asia, the struggle is not just to bring the animals back to health, but to avoid getting too comfortable around a highly intelligent and sometimes socialized wild animal. ""We follow very strict protocols as far as safety is concerned,"" says Officer. ""Even if they're hand-raised as cubs, at a certain age it's hands off,"" adding that it's easy to let your guard down around animals that sometimes seem and behave like pets. ""They're very quick,"" she says, looking at a bear eyeing its new surroundings and keepers. ""But it is tempting sometimes.""","14 Moon Bears have been rescued from a bear bile farm in Vietnam .

"(CNN) -- A British science teacher admitted Monday to trying to help anti-Assad regime fighters commit acts of terrorism in Syria. Jamshed Javeed, 30, from the northern English city of Manchester, pleaded guilty to two terrorism charges at Woolwich Crown Court. Police said the father of one had helped four associates travel to Syria for terrorism purposes last year and had planned to join them in the war-torn country. ""He bought equipment for himself and for ISIS fighters to use once he arrived in Syria,"" Greater Manchester Police said in a statement. Javeed's family had grown suspicious of his behavior and confronted him in December, urging him not to go to Syria, but he had said he was committed, police said. Counterterrorism officers arrested Javeed at his home December 21, two days after the confrontation. ""Javeed was an otherwise law-abiding man who had a responsible job, a child and another one on the way,"" Detective Chief Superintendent Tony Mole said. ""However, from August last year both his appearance and behavior started to change and in a short space of time he started to support the ISIS cause and those planning to travel to Syria. ""His family grew suspicious and were clearly intent on stopping him, but he ignored their pleas and told them he was determined to go through with his plans to travel to Syria. He had bought equipment to take with him and had given money to help others travel there,"" Mole said. The case demonstrated the importance of informing authorities early about someone's intentions to join a group such as ISIS, Mole said. Not an extremist, defense says . But Javeed is not an extremist, his defense attorneys said. The defense argued that Javeed was ""deeply moved by the images and reports of the extreme suffering of the Syrian people at the hands of Bashar Al-Assad's vicious regime."" Javeed's actions followed footage of chemical weapons use against civilians in Syria and British Prime Minister David Cameron's failed attempt to get Parliament to approve joining military action against the Assad regime, said a document setting out the basis for the guilty plea. ""It was against this background ... that Jamshed Javeed subsequently came to the conclusion that he should go to support the ordinary people of Syria. He accepts that this would have meant becoming involved in some fighting, as well as humanitarian relief."" The defense said that Javeed did not know he could be prosecuted for making plans to travel to Syria to fight pro-Assad forces and would not have gone if he had known so.

""The defendant would not travel to Syria now. There is no coherent rebel force seeking to defeat Assad. He is appalled at the indiscriminate brutality of ISIS."" Javeed is being held in custody for sentencing on December 12. A teacher at high school . Javeed had taught at Sharples High School in Bolton, Greater Manchester. The school teaches students ages 11 to 16. In January, the Bolton News newspaper reported Javeed's arrest. It quoted Sharples head teacher Rachel Quesnel as saying the school was ""working closely with the police to ensure the situation is resolved as quickly as possible."" ""I have taken the decision, along with the chair of governors, to suspend the teacher from his teaching duties in order that a full investigation can take place,"" Quesnel told the paper. ""Please be assured that there is no evidence to suggest that Mr. Javeed's alleged actions are related to his role as teacher at Sharples School, nor is there anything to suggest that our pupils or the wider community have been under any kind of risk.""

"(CNN) -- Tyra Banks has gone from supermodel to super businesswoman. Tyra Banks shows off her real hair during an appearance on ""Larry King Live."" With her successful TV talk show, ""The Tyra Show,"" as well as her duties as host/creator and executive producer of ""America's Next Top Model, it would seem that Banks has scant room left on her plate. But she recently launched an online magazine called ""TYRA: Beauty Inside and Out."" Banks talked to CNN's Larry King about her career aspirations, the ""F"" word and the story behind her ""real hair."" The following is an edited version of the interview. Larry King: Are you looking to be Oprah? Is that it? Tyra Banks: Am I looking to be Oprah? Oh, Lord, if I tried, I would fail. King: But you're approaching it -- magazines, shows, specials. ... Banks: She is like the -- the Godmama, you know? There will never be another. There never has been and never will be another. But looking to be her -- no. I mean, I -- I started as a model, so there's a path that's quite different. King: The last time you were on you were dealing with the ""F"" word, meaning fat. You were fighting back. There [was] a nonflattering tabloid photo of you -- remember? In the swimsuit? Banks: Yes. King: You lost weight since then. Banks: Yes. King: Do you still feel an image pressure? Do you think -- you think like a fat person? Banks: I don't actually. You know, when I -- when I told the world to kiss my fat -- I can say ""ass"" right? King: Yes, you can. Banks: Yes. When I told the world to kiss my fat ass, I remained that size for two years. I maintained it with my ice cream and my salad with ranch and dressing and croutons and bacon bits. Like I -- I didn't look at myself even on television and think that I was too big or -- I don't know. I didn't -- it didn't connect. But since I have lost a lot of weight, and it started with the -- a weight loss challenge, actually at the top of this year. So I'm two years after ""kiss my fat ass."" King: When you look in the mirror, are you happy with the way you look? Banks: I've -- OK, I might be doing a little TMI -- do you know what TMI is? Too much information?  Watch Banks discuss her body image » . King: Well, give it to me anyway. Banks: I always feel great when I don't have clothes on. So at home, by myself, walking past ... King: Oh, we're glad you mean that now. Banks: Just too much information. But I always feel good that way. King: So you don't look at yourself nude and say, ""Oh, I don't like this."" You like it? Banks: No, unless the lighting is bad in the dressing room. But, no. I always feel good. But sometimes certain clothes, when I put them on and they don't fit the way that I would like them to, that's when I tend to get self-conscious. King: All right. You kicked off season five of your talk show by revealing your real hair. Banks: Let's talk about my hair right now. I know it's been a big mystery. And I was like it was an unsolved mystery, and I felt like I needed to solve this mystery. Like I've worn weaves and wigs and pieces and clip-ons and clip-outs and clip-downs and around since I was 17, 18, and I wanted to show the real me. I wanted to show the raw me, and I just got out of the shower -- beat the face first of course, you all -- and then came out of here -- on this stage, and this is me, you all. This is me. King: How did that feel? Banks: Oh my God, it felt so liberating. It felt so liberating. I have worn fake hair since I was 17 years old. King: This -- is this real? Banks: Yes. This is me. You want to feel my scalp? King: Yes. Banks: Yes? It's a little kinky in the scalp. That's like real black girl hair. But -- go -- go in there. Yes. That's -- yes. It's kinky. Exactly. My natural hair texture is very kinky. You felt my real hair texture. This is straightened. This part is straightened. This part is not, inside. But, I mean, hair for black women, we spend $9 billion a year on hair products -- black women do. So growing up as a young girl and seeing images in the media where they're saying that a certain type of hair is beautiful and yours isn't is very difficult for a black woman -- for black women and it's a -- it's a long, political thing that we can do a whole show about. But I felt it was my responsibility to show as much of my real hair as possible.","Tyra Banks tells Larry King she is happy with her body image .

"(CNN) -- As the fall disappearance of a college student haunts Virginia yet again, police across the state are scrambling to determine whether Jesse Matthew, the suspect in Hannah Graham's disappearance this month, is linked to other slayings and disappearances. Already, police say they've linked Matthew via DNA to a Virginia Tech student's death, and years ago, authorities said DNA in that student's case was connected to a 2005 abduction and sexual assault in Fairfax. Graham hasn't been seen since disappearing in the early morning hours of September 13, as she walked through a busy dining and shopping district in Charlottesville. Police say they believe Matthew was the last person with her. It is the latest in a series of mysteries involving young people who have disappeared or been killed in the area, which includes the Route 29 corridor and its frightening reputation for vanishing young women. August 2009: Two Virginia Tech students killed . In August 2009, Heidi Childs and her boyfriend of four years, David Metzler, were shot dead with a rifle in a national park about 10 miles from the Virginia Tech campus in Blacksburg. Three years later, authorities in Montgomery County, Virginia, announced they had DNA evidence in the case. They didn't say how the DNA was obtained. ""We have DNA, we are aggressively and actively pursuing you,"" Sheriff Tommy Whitt said, according to CNN affiliate WJLA. ""We will not rest until you are apprehended."" Whitt said that Childs' purse, cell phone, credit card, digital camera and Virginia Tech ID were stolen. The Washington Post reported at the time of the killings that Childs' body was outside the car, while Metzler was inside the vehicle. Sheriff's Capt. Robert New confirmed Tuesday to CNN's Jean Casarez that ""they are following this case (of Jesse Matthew) closely"" to see whether it is connected to the killing of Childs, 18, and Metzler, 19. The area is two hours from Charlottesville and 90 minutes from Liberty University in Lynchburg, where Matthew once attended college more than dozen years ago. October 2009: Lynchburg woman killed . Cassandra Morton, 23, was reported missing in October 2009 in Lynchburg. About seven weeks later, her body was found off a hiking trail at the bottom of Candlers Mountain. Parts of her decomposed body, including her head, were found scattered, CNN affiliate WSLS reported in 2012, though officials attributed that to animals. A spokesman for the Campbell County Sheriff's Office said Morton was found under brush as if someone tried to hide the body. Officials believe she was killed elsewhere, the station reported. Her body was discovered by a hiker. Campbell County Sheriff Steve Hutcherson said Tuesday that his office never closes homicide cases. ""We follow up on any leads, we have to do due diligence, and we have to leave no stone unturned,"" he said, while telling CNN they will investigate to see whether there is a connection to Graham's disappearance. The sheriff noted that Morton was reported missing by her parents the same day as Morgan Harrington, a Virginia Tech student whose body was found in January 2010. ""There are definitely some similarities, and it warrants further looking into. We're going to do everything we can to prove or disprove. ... We'll do more investigations and see where it leads us."" October 2009: Virginia Tech student killed . Morgan Harrington, a 20-year-old Virginia Tech student, also disappeared in October 2009. She went missing while attending a Metallica concert in Charlottesville after becoming separated from her friends. She was last seen hitchhiking. Harrington's purse, with her identification and cell phone inside, was found the next day in an overflow parking lot near the arena, police said. A necklace she wore and her camera were never recovered. Jesse Matthew is linked to her death through DNA, law enforcement sources have told CNN. Virginia State Police only have said that there is a ""new forensic link"" between Harrington's and Graham's cases. Harrington's skeletal remains were found in January 2010 on a large farm about 10 miles from where she was last seen. In July of that year, state police announced that forensic evidence linked her death to the 2005 case of a woman who said she was abducted and sexually assaulted in Fairfax, near Washington. It was later revealed it was DNA recovered in Harrington's killing that was linked to the Fairfax attack. The woman described the man she said attacked her and police and FBI circulated a sketch of the suspect. The FBI said the suspect is an African-American man with facial hair. In 2005, he was between the ages of 25 and 35. He was thought to be 6 feet tall. September 2010: Virginia woman disappears . Police also are investigating Matthew's possible ties to a missing person case. Samantha Ann Clarke was last seen September 13, 2010, in Orange, Virginia. Orange Police Chief James Fenwick told CNN: ""We are in the process of looking at it now; we would be derelict in our duties if we weren't doing that."" Looking at any possible ties is ""something we can't ignore,"" he said. Clarke, 19, disappeared after slipping out of her townhouse after midnight. She told her 14-year-old brother that she was going out with friends. Earlier this month, authorities searched a lake again in Greene County, looking for Clarke's remains. Her mother, Barbara Tinder, thinks a convicted murderer could lead authorities to her. ""Randy Taylor come and picked her up. He called here six times,"" Tinder told Charlottesville television station WCAV. ""Why would you call my daughter six times if you ain't trying to lead her on or try to talk her to come out the house, or try to do something?"" Taylor, 43, has been sentenced to two life terms in a separate case -- the 2013 abduction and murder of Alexis Murphy, although the teen's body has never been found. Taylor was seen on surveillance video at the same gas station as Murphy, 17. He has maintained he is innocent, saying he and Alexis went back to his camper to smoke marijuana with another man. The other man was not Jesse Matthew, the Commonwealth Attorney for Nelson County, Anthony Martin, said. Taylor's attorney asked in a letter Thursday for the state to re-examine the case in light of the Matthew investigation. CNN's Randi Kaye, Jean Casarez, Pamela Brown and Justin Lear contributed to this report.","There are several unsolved killings in Virginia that police are rechecking .

The pilot's remains were recovered from the Gulf later in the day, the Air Force said Thursday night. It wasn't immediately clear whether the Air Force had found the aircraft; it earlier said that it was working on the assumption that the jet crashed into the water. The pilot's name wasn't immediately released.","An F-16 crashed during a training mission over Gulf of Mexico, the Air Force says .

"(CNN) -- When even the most secluded beach on the mainland is too crowded, there's always the option of renting a private island for your vacation. Really. Many would require every credit card you've got and more, but others are a little more within reach -- especially if you rent with a group of friends. Whether you're planning or dreaming, here are a few extraordinary places to get away from it all: . Vomo Island, Fiji . Fijian royal chiefs once liked to head to Vomo in the Mamanuca Islands group for a little R&R. You too can be chief of your kingdom for about $39,000 a night (make that a mere $34,000 or so during low season). The 225-acre island accommodates up to 90 people, and with a staff of 120, you won't lack for assistance in nearly any activity you want to pursue. Snorkeling above coral reefs, paddle boarding, glass bottom kayaking, windsurfing and daily fish feeding are included in the rate. World's 100 best beaches . Hike up Mount Vomo for another perspective on the aqua waters of the South Pacific. Another memorable event is the Meke and Lovo night. The meal comes from the lovo, a traditional Fijian underground cooking pit, and the high spirits from the meke, an evening of traditional dances and song. Easier on the wallet: . Garden villas for two run about $1,000 per night; beachfront villas cost about $1,300 per night. Isola de Li Galli, Italy . Remember the sirens, those beautiful women who lured sailors to their death on craggy shores? Some say they lived at Isola de Li Galli, a private island that now sleeps up to 13 nonsiren types for just shy of $200,000 per week. The island is well-positioned just minutes off the Amalfi Coast, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. You'd expect a private European island to attract celebrities, and you'd be right. Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem have been among Isola de Li Galli's guests, and the island was once home to the great Russian dancer Rudolf Nureyev. Be forewarned: A pad for landing your helicopter is included, but engaging the 115-foot yacht requires an extra fee. A dramatic stone-and-white chapel is available if matrimony calls you. The island is only available by the week, so start negotiating with your well-to-do friends. America's best little beach towns . Guana Island, British Virgin Islands . Richard Branson's Necker Island is currently a steal starting at $42,500 per night while its Great House is being rebuilt -- after that, the price goes up. But if you're looking for other options in the area, Guana Island starts at about half that -- roughly $22,000 nightly for up to 32 guests -- with seven beaches, a tennis court, sailboats and pedal boats, more than a dozen trails and a spa among its amenities. (A massage overlooking the Caribbean sounds pretty good about now.) Experienced divers gravitate to the North Bay's deep reefs and underwater cave. In August and October, the academically minded appreciate the chance to join visiting scientists in their pursuits, from rebuilding coral reefs to tagging iguanas. Speaking of which, the island draws its name from a rock outcropping that resembles the head of the tropical lizard. Easier on the wallet: . If a five-digit price tag is not in the budget (and is pretty much permanently out of the question), you can forgo reserving the entire island and share the 850-acre expanse with a few dozen other guests. Rates for a cottage or villa for two start at about $700 and $1,500, respectively. Rubondo Island, Lake Victoria, Tanzania . In 1966, Dr. Bernhard Grzimek, one of the forces behind the creation of the Serengeti National Park, brought 16 chimps from European zoos to Rubondo Island in Tanzania to give them a safe haven. The chimps thrived on the island, also home to elephants, giraffes and hippos. And it's available to you, for $4,500 a night, along with up to 15 friends. Guests at Rubondo Island Camp, which opened in late 2012, can get a Jane Goodall-style experience by tracking chimps through the forest and observing their behavior with specialist guides. More traditional game drives are also available. If that's not enough, some 300 species of birds have been spotted here. The lodge and its eight suites feature thatch roofs, curved walls and traditional East African fabrics. Easier on the wallet: . Can't find 15 takers for this trip? Don't fret, there's a starting per-person nightly rate of $620 for double occupancy that includes meals, drinks and activities. Madivaru Island, Maldives . Living in tents may not sound like luxury, but the tents at Banyan Tree Madivaru aren't anything like the canopy you hoisted at scout camp. Each villa on this private island in the Maldives includes three tented spaces for living, sleeping and bathing. Think timber flooring and rattan and teak furniture, not sleeping bags and mosquitos. Add a private plunge pool for each villa, a personal chef and waiter, and activities such as water skiing, dolphin cruises, night fishing and a Maldivian cooking school. Many visitors say it feels like a private island even when there are other guests, but those who want to be sure can spring for the whole island buyout, currently available at a special rate of $9,420 per night for up to 12 people, with a minimum four-night stay. Easier on the wallet: . Tent villa rates start at $2,355 per night. The special whole-island rate may be the most economical option this summer -- provided you can round up a group, airfare and about $40,000. Orca Island, Alaska . Orca Island is proof that island adventure doesn't have to be limited to warm-weather climes. From Seward, Alaska, it's just a half-hour water taxi ride to Orca Island Cabins, where Dennis and Susan Swiderski have created an unusual vacation retreat. Guests can view humpback and orca whales, sea lions, harbor seals, porpoises and river otters right from each yurt's private deck or the island's common areas. (Incredibly, humpback whales often visit just feet from the island.) Kayaks, stand-up paddle boards, rowing skiff and fishing gear are included in the full facility rate of $2,150 per night, which covers all five yurts. Easier on the wallet: . The 2013 per-person rate is $215 per night for a two-night minimum, based on double occupancy. In 2014, that rate will be $225 per person, per night. Eagle Island, Georgia . With weekday rates of $600 per night for up to 12 guests, you'd be forgiven for assuming Eagle Island is a forlorn rock at the start of nowhere. It's actually a 10-acre isle off the coast of Georgia, surrounded by salt marsh that's a lovely setting for crabbing. Transportation to and from the island is included, and boat rentals are available if you want to explore and fish the surrounding waters of the Darien River and the May Hall Creek. The lodge with huge wraparound porch sleeps 12 and is built largely of recycled materials, such as vintage brick. Foodies, rejoice: Along with the standard kitchen, an outdoor setup includes seafood steamers, low country boil cook stations, smoker with wood chips and other tools for your blue crab dinner. You can even arrange to get the kitchen stocked before you arrive. Other gathering spots tend to be the outdoor fireplace and hot tub, not to mention the romantic appeal of the outdoor shower. Easier on the wallet: . Why not gather a dozen friends for a weekly rental? Six nights run $3,300.","About $200,000 among friends will buy you a weeklong Mediterranean dream .
Many of the island rental options offer more affordable rates if you share with strangers .
Island rentals range from pristine beach havens in Fiji to quiet fishing outposts in Georgia ."
"(CNN) -- It's a double threat. Hurricanes are barreling through the ocean on both sides of the continental United States. Hurricane Gonzalo on Friday slammed the British territory of Bermuda in the North Atlantic Ocean. Hurricane Ana is heading for the Hawaiian Islands and could cause trouble over the weekend. Hurricane warnings were posted on Bermuda as Gonzalo raged through the region. The powerful Category 3 storm battered the island with wind gusts that topped 115 miles per hour, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami, as it moved in a northeasterly direction at 16 miles per hour. The eye of the storm was forecast to pass over Bermuda late Friday, the agency said. Gonzalo could cause widespread power outages, property damage, dangerous storm surge and major flooding. But the island is ready. ""Bermuda we are prepared,"" said Premier Michael Dunkley. ""Well-rehearsed plans for most contingencies are enacted, and as we hope for the best, we are prepared for the worst."" Ahead of the storm, Bermuda closed schools, shut down bus and ferry service, and opened up shelters. Forecasters predicted Gonzalo will weaken to as it moves past Bermuda and pushes into the North Atlantic by Saturday. In 2003, Hurricane Fabian caused more than $300 million in damages. It also knocked out power to most of the island. 2014 Atlantic Hurricane Season facts . In the Pacific Ocean, Hawaiians are hunkering down, preparing for the approach of Hurricane Ana. The storm strengthened into a Category 1 storm Friday afternoon with maximum sustained winds of 75 miles per hour, according to the Central Pacific Hurricane Center in Honolulu. A tropical storm watch is posted in some areas, meaning sustained winds of 39 to 73 miles per hour are possible within 48 hours. The storm was about 230 miles south of Hilo late Friday afternoon, the agency posted on its website. Ana is expected to approach the Big Island by Saturday as a Category 1 hurricane, but it's unlikely to make actual landfall, according to some forecasters. But Gov. Neil Abercrombie isn't taking any chances. Abercrombie declared a state of emergency earlier this week in advance of Ana's arrival. The emergency proclamation ""allows us to respond quickly to any potential impacts,"" he said. Ana could cause dangerous surf conditions, coastal flooding and mudslides as it moves through the region. Some areas could see up to the 8 inches of rain with as much as 12 inches in isolated areas. Hurricanes are a rare occurrence in Hawaii. Only three storms have made a direct landfall on the islands in the past 55 years, according to the Central Pacific Hurricane Center. But it's already been an unusual year for Hawaiians, weatherwise. The island chain has already been hit by two damaging tropical storms so far this season.

"(CNN) -- Texas Presbyterian Hospital ""fell short"" several times in treating Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan, starting by not asking the right questions in the emergency room, the hospital's chief clinical officer, Dr. Daniel Varga, said in an interview with CNN. On September 25, Duncan came into the ER with a fever and was interviewed by a nurse who wrote down that he ""came from Africa 9-20-14,"" Varga said. The nurse didn't specify which nation, he said. Around the same time a physician recorded Duncan as ""a local resident, no contact with sick people. No symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,"" Varga said. Duncan, a 42-year-old Liberian native, was let go four hours later. He returned to the hospital a few days later and on October 8 became the first person to die of Ebola in the United States. New questions in the emergency room . Varga said the hospital has updated its admitting policy and that ER workers ask whether patients have traveled to five specific countries in Africa. ""We were completely prepared to take care of someone who came in with a diagnosis of Ebola,"" Varga said. ""The place where we fell short was being able to diagnose a patient walking in off the street with symptoms that could be consistent with Ebola or anything else and really being able to manage that."" After Duncan died and two nurses who cared for him contracted Ebola, the CDC issued new guidelines Monday on how health care workers should handle Ebola cases. The CDC director stressed that hospitals train workers more thoroughly and make sure no skin is exposed when dealing with Ebola patients. Varga told CNN the hospital didn't conduct enough training in how to handle Ebola patients -- something that contributed to the initial misdiagnosis. ""Where we fell short was in really going through simulation and training and drilling around what might happen if someone with appropriate (symptoms), appropriate history showed up to the ED and raised a suspicion of Ebola,"" he said. Complete coverage on Ebola . Two nurses weren't told not to travel . Varga was asked if any nurses raised concerns about having to treat an Ebola patient. He replied, ""Not to my knowledge."" Yet several days ago nurses at the hospital complained about lack of safety protocols at the hospital, such as having protective gear that left their necks uncovered. Varga said the hospital didn't issue no-travel mandates to two nurses who treated Duncan and later developed Ebola. One of them flew on commercial flights. ""Our job was to identify the folks who were the contacts of Mr. Duncan and travel policy and all that other sort of stuff was largely dictated by county, state and the CDC,"" Varga said. He said the policy has been changed so that hospital workers who might contract Ebola are told not to take public transportation. Duncan's family has criticized the hospital, saying they don't think he had to die. Varga said he doesn't know if that's true. ""I don't think you can prognosticate about whether there would have been a change in outcome,"" he said. ""We are certainly forthcoming and transparent about the fact that we missed a diagnosis on the 25th and 26th, and we've said over again that that's something that we deeply regret and wish we could have hit the diagnosis right then.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Democrats aiming to keep the Senate are facing tough odds in next week's election with their chances depending on convincing a surge of women and African-Americans to vote. Both sets of voters will be vital in two of the crucial races — in North Carolina and Iowa — which new CNN polls show are headed for photo-finishes with only three days of campaigning left. Republicans are especially bullish in Iowa, where their candidate, Iraq war veteran Joni Ernst, leads Bruce Braley by 49% to 47% for a Senate seat Democrats have held for nearly 30 years. Braley leads among women voters by 12 points in the CNN/ORC International survey — but Ernst does three points better than that among men and also dominates the potentially decisive bloc of rural voters. In North Carolina, home of the most expensive midterm race in history, Sen. Kay Hagan leads by two points and enjoys a slim gender gap. Her advantage comes after she spent much of this election cycle slamming Republican foe Thom Tillis over his attitude to equal pay legislation. The GOP has a solid grip on the House but Republicans need a net gain of six seats to grab the Senate for the first time in nearly a decade. They're expected to easily win South Dakota, Montana and West Virginia to bring them to the cusp of victory on Tuesday. Other battlegrounds are in Alaska, Arkansas, Louisiana, New Hampshire and Colorado, making the outcome of the election too close to call. And Republicans have to watch a few seats of their own. Democrat Michelle Nunn is surprisingly strong in Georgia and Republican Sen. Pat Roberts is struggling to put away an independent challenger in Kansas. Election day might be Tuesday, but more 14.8 million Americans have voted already, casting early, absentee and mailed-in ballots, according to Dr. Michael McDonald of the United States Elections Project. Both parties are claiming the early edge. In North Carolina, for instance, 48 percent of the more than 870,000 early voters were Democratic, a potentially significant boost for Hagan. Democratic National Committee spokesman Michael Czin said the party is encouraged because it is seeing early voting from people who didn't show up in the last midterm elections in 2010. That election was disastrous for Democrats when the tea party wave helped Republicans take control of the House. But in Iowa, a state where Democrats usually have the edge in early voting, Ernst is tied in early returns. And in another danger sign for Democrats, Republican Cory Gardner is up 10 points in Colorado. Republican National Committee spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski said that the GOP's predictive analysis shows Democrats are behind in early voting. ""We have changed our strategy and are turning out more voters who normally wouldn't vote in midterm elections and are turning them out earlier than we ever have before,"" she said. Early voting is especially crucial for the Democrats, because their base voters are historically less prone to show up in midterm elections. A heavy early turnout for the party could help offset expected enthusiasm among Republicans on Election Day. Setting the stage for a frantic final weekend of campaigning for an election that will set the stage for the early skirmishes of the 2016 presidential campaign, top party surrogates were out in force. Bill Clinton is blitzing states where President Barack Obama, with his tattered political brand, would not be effective and was hitting the trail for Hagan on Friday. Obama did, however, get off a few blows in friendly territory in Rhode Island on Friday, saying that Republicans backed policies towards women and politicians that belonged in a ""Mad Men"" episode. On the Republican side, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is visiting three states -- Arkansas, Kansas and Wisconsin and Rand Paul was at a lunch in Pennsylvania with embattled GOP Gov. Tom Corbett. As both parties focus on turnout, the discussion in the competitive Louisiana Senate contest is turning to race. Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu angered Republicans by suggesting to NBC News that Obama has a tough time in the South because the region has not ""always been the friendliest place for African-Americans."" Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a Republican, blasted Landrieu's comment as ""remarkably divisive"" and said Obama was unpopular because of his policies. ""She appears to be living in a different century,"" he said in a statement. ""Trying to blame it on race is ridiculous."" Landrieu later repeated her line in a statement that also attributed Obama's unpopularity in Louisiana to energy policies, including a moratorium on offshore oil drilling. ""In addition, the south has not always been the friendliest or easiest place for African Americans to advance, and it's been a difficult place for women to be recognized as the leaders we are,"" she said. ""Everyone knows this is the truth, and I will continue to speak the truth even as some would twist my words seeking political advantage."" And as the midterm season winds down, potential 2016 presidential contenders are getting a taste of what life might be like on the campaign trail if they decide to seek the White House. Hillary Clinton was repeatedly heckled Thursday in Maryland by activists backing a path to citizenship for young, undocumented immigrants. ""I am a strong supporter of immigration reform,"" the former secretary of state shouted over the rowdy rally.","Tuesday's election could determine Senate control .

"Chapel Hill, North Carolina (CNN) -- What happens to the 3,100 students who enrolled in fake classes and now have a degree stamped with the seal of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill -- an institution consistently ranked among the nation's top public schools? Likely nothing. The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools is currently reviewing a scathing report, prepared by former federal prosecutor Ken Wainstein, which showed thousands of UNC students took fraudulent classes, some of them multiple times. But Belle Wheelan, the president of the association -- which is charged with accrediting degree-granting higher education institutions in the South, from Virginia to Texas -- told CNN that her group can't take away degrees. ""UNC has to verify every degree they give all the time. We ask them to make sure all courses really are legitimate,"" Wheelan said. ""All we can do ... is put them on sanction for lack of integrity. ""As far as taking those degrees back, there's nothing we can do."" UNC officials told CNN say they are still deciding how to try to remedy the fact that so many students graduated with credits from the so-called ""paper classes"" on their transcripts. Some students earned many credits taking multiple ""GPA booster"" classes. One student was enrolled in 19 different paper classes, Wainstein said. ""We're considering options on these matters and are working closely with SACS to evaluate possible courses of action,"" said spokesman Rick White. UNC report: 18 years of academic fraud . Expert: 'Nearly impossible' to take away degrees . Gerald Gurney, president of the Drake Group for academic integrity in collegiate sport and the former president of the National Association of Academic Advisers for Athletics, called the UNC fraud the largest and most nefarious academic scandal in the history of the NCAA. ""The depth and breadth of the scheme -- involving counselors, coaches, academic administrators, faculty, athletic administrators, etc. -- eclipses any previous case,"" Gurney said. But, while Gurney believes the NCAA should punish the university, he does not think that the students could lose the legitimacy of their degrees. ""Lifting diplomas from students who were advised to take these classes is nearly impossible,"" he said. The last time SACS investigated the paper classes -- when UNC insisted they existed on a much smaller scale -- the association made UNC offer new classes to students who had been enrolled in the fake ones. But the enrollment in the remedy class was optional, Wheelan said. UNC told CNN that 11 students opted to retake a class. The suspect classes were started by a professor's assistant in the African-American studies program (AFAM) who had sympathy for those at the school who were ""not the best and the brightest."" That assistant, Debbie Crowder, and professor Julius Nyang'oro then worked with several advisers in athletics to help student-athletes on the brink of eligibility keep their GPAs up, according to the report. One former football player, Mike McAdoo, told CNN earlier this year that his adviser told him to major in AFAM, and then put him in several paper classes, even though he had interest in majoring in something else. From emails that were attached to Wainstein's report, it's clear that some athletes were placed in these classes because they were struggling. One email, written by former women's basketball academics adviser Jan Boxill, suggests an athlete is only enrolled in ""two real courses."" Other emails show how counselors were calculated in adding, then dropping, and shifting athletes from class to class trying to keep them eligible to play. UNC fake class scandal and NCAA's response wind their way to Washington . Report: Nearly half of 3,100 students were athletes . This all comes as no surprise to whistleblower Mary Willingham. She sounded the alarm on paper classes and was a lone voice against the university when it insisted that the whole scheme fell to the shoulders of Nyang'oro and Crowder alone. Willingham told CNN that many people were involved and that the paper classes were used as a crutch for underprepared athletes. She said that in January -- a month before the Wainstein and his firm, Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, was hired by UNC to do another investigation into what happened over the last two decades. Whistleblower in UNC paper class case files lawsuit . What Wainstein found was significantly bigger than what UNC had admitted to for the last five years. Nearly half of the 3,100 students were athletes. ""A good number of these student-athletes were ""steered"" to the AFAM paper classes by certain academic counselors in ASPSA,"" Wainstein's report says. His report says paper classes served as ""GPA boosters"" for athletes who were on the brink of eligibility. Why? Willingham says it's because they were admitted to UNC just to play -- and they couldn't keep up in the classroom the way they could keep up on the field, she says. Willingham has been attacked for saying that. One UNC official even publicly said she was lying. Now, the 131-page report and hundreds of supplemental documents appear to back her up. Willingham sat at her kitchen table this week, watching the University of North Carolina admit to nearly two decades of academic fraud. All she could think about were the athletes she tutored who she says were terribly unprepared for real classes at UNC. Many, she says, could barely read. ""I think about where they are, you know, what are they doing,"" she said, sitting at that same table the next day. ""It's hard to find a lot of those guys. And so I was wondering if they were paying any attention to this and if it had any meaning for them."" Federal education privacy rules forbid the university from publicly identifying the students involved in the paper classes. UNC in January: We failed students 'for years' Roy Williams: 'We tried to do the right thing' UNC said the Wainstein report came to a different conclusion than previous investigations because he had the cooperation of Nyang'oro and Crowder, who previously weren't talking. Nyang'oro was charged with fraud -- a charge later dropped when he began cooperating with Wainstein. But it's unclear why previous investigations did not uncover the damning emails, or whether the statements of the athletic advisers were different in the past. The latest one, though, did find that some coaches knew what was happening. Former head football coach John Bunting, for instance, told investigators he knew of the paper classes. His successor, Butch Davis, who was fired a few years back for his role, also admitted some knowledge. The investigators made no findings about Dean Smith, the legendary basketball coach and sports icon who coached 36 years at UNC. And the current basketball coach, Roy Williams, has adamantly denied knowing anything. Reacting Saturday to the report, Williams told reporters ""it's a very sad time for me"" as not only UNC's head basketball coach, but also a former assistant coach and student there. As to what happens next, Williams said he doesn't see anything in Wainstein's report pertaining to ""men's basketball that somebody can immediately look at and say this is going to happen or this is not going to happen."" ""The thing about it is that we tried to do the right thing,"" the coach said. ""I can't determine what the NCAA is going to do.""

"(CNN) -- The effects of an employee's alleged sabotage of the Illinois air traffic control center where he worked continued to be felt by air travelers through the weekend. By Saturday afternoon, more than 660 flights scheduled to either take off or land at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport were canceled, according to the Chicago Department of Aviation. Another 120 had been canceled over at the city's Midway Airport. The disruption stems from a Friday morning fire at the FAA Chicago En Route Center in nearby Aurora, a critical air traffic control center. Police say that blaze was set intentionally by Brian Howard, a contract employee at the facility, before he apparently attempted to kill himself. An FBI affidavit says that a first responder saw some feet sticking out from under a table and found a shirtless Howard ""in the process of actively slicing his throat with another knife."" He told paramedics to ""leave me alone,"" the affidavit said. He survived and was taken to an area hospital. His condition was not available Saturday. He's charged with one count of destruction of aircraft or aircraft facilities, a felony that could land him a 20-year prison sentence. No court date has been set. Ominous Facebook message . According to the FBI, Howard, 36, had worked at the center for eight years but was facing a transfer to Hawaii. In a private Facebook message sent to a relative just before the fire, he wrote ""Take a hard look in the mirror, I have,"" the message said, according to the affidavit. ""And this is why I am about to take out ZAU [the three-letter identification for the control center] and my life. ... So I'm gonna smoke this blunt and move on, take care everyone."" Then, at 5:40 a.m., Howard -- who worked in ""telecommunications matters,"" according to the FBI -- apparently started the fire in the control center's basement, causing the facility that controls flights in several Midwest states to evacuate and shut down. The effects were immediate. O'Hare -- the second-busiest airport on the planet according to Airports Council International -- is a main hub for United Airlines and other major carriers, with flights headed to international destinations. When controllers stop flights scheduled to there, it has the potential to trigger a line of falling air-traffic dominoes that will ruin travel plans for countless would-be passengers. By Friday evening, more than 2,000 flights had been canceled in and out of Chicago's two airports. The ripple effect caused disruptions at airports across the nation. Southwest Airlines suspended all fights Friday not only in Chicago, but at Milwaukee's General Mitchell International Airport as well. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport had 70 cancellations and there were 56 at New York's LaGuardia Airport. FAA divvies up Chicago air traffic control . The FAA said that a clean-up crew was brought in Saturday ""to begin drying out water-damaged equipment"" in the telecommunications room where Howard set the fire, as well as to clean and sanitize the area after the attempted suicide. But just when ZAU will be fully operational again is not yet known. ""Technicians also are completing a thorough damage assessment and timeline for restoration of services,"" the agency said Saturday. ""The FAA is using all the tools at its disposal to safely restore as much service as quickly as possible."" The FAA said over the weekend that it was managing the air traffic in and out of Chicago ""through other large Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) facilities in Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin with additional help from high-altitude centers in Minnesota, Kansas, Indiana and Ohio."" In the meantime, the FAA said ZAU's displaced employees ""are assisting at the TRACON facility in Elgin, Illinois and other air traffic facilities.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Years of budget cuts have made two key U.S. agencies' efforts to contain the threat of Ebola harder than it should be, Rep. Chris Van Hollen told CNN on Thursday. The Maryland Democrat pointed to spending cuts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health, which are both involved in the response to a Dallas man who this week became the first patient diagnosed with Ebola in the United States. ""There's no doubt that the deep health care cuts that we've seen have made it more difficult to respond in a rapid and comprehensive way to the Ebola outbreak,"" Van Hollen said. ""They're doing everything they can with the resources they have now, but the cuts they've seen in past years, they were like eroding the foundation and it clearly meant that they were starting from behind,"" he said. No 'Ebola czar' is forthcoming, White House says . The CDC saw its discretionary funding cut by $585 million from 2010 to 2014, while the NIH's budget was slashed by $446 million over the last four years. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infections Diseases, spelled out the impact of the cuts in dire terms during a recent hearing on Capitol Hill. ""I have to tell you honestly it's been a significant impact on us,"" Fauci said. ""It has both in an acute and a chronic, insidious way eroded our ability to respond in the way that I and my colleagues would like to see us be able to respond to these emerging threats. And in my institute particularly, that's responsible for responding on the dime to an emerging infectious disease threat, this is particularly damaging."" CDC director: Why U.S. can stop Ebola in its tracks . The CDC also cited the budget cuts in a report earlier this year, saying that annual funding for its public health preparedness and response efforts were $1 billion lower in the 2013 fiscal year than in 2002. ""CDC continues to work with reduced financial resources, which similarly affects state, local, and insular public health departments,"" the report said. ""These losses make it difficult for state and local health departments to continue to expand their preparedness capabilities, instead forcing them to focus on maintaining their current capabilities.""

"(CNN) -- Conflict and hardship have long made Goma a difficult place to live in, but one woman has set out to change that -- and she's using soft croissants and fresh coffee. When Vanessa Jados opened the ""Au Bon Pain"" bakery in May, she brought something new to the residents of the town in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Six months on, she is showing no signs of shutting up shop. ""Goma is my home,"" says Jados, 27. ""I am very proud of Goma. It's the most beautiful part of Democratic Republic of Congo, and people here need fresh bread just like people in Europe."" Nestled between a mountainous national park and a freshwater lake, Goma sounds like the ideal setting for a holiday and the perfect place for a bakery. But the determined entrepreneur has had to overcome electricity, supply and staffing problems to make her dream a reality. Goma's troubles . Born in Goma, Jados was sent by her parents to study in Belgium at the age of 12. ""I had been to Belgium once before with my family, but that time it was just me and my two sisters,"" she recalls. ""Leaving my parents behind was tough."" Jados wasn't to return home for 11 years. During her absence, Goma felt the horrific effects of the 1994 genocide in neighboring Rwanda as refugees fled across the nearby border. By the end of the 1990s an armed rebel movement called RCD-Goma were running the town, and Human Rights Watch says the group forcibly recruited child soldiers to wage war in the politically unstable region where Uganda, Rwanda and the DRC meet. As the armed conflict rumbled on in January 2002, molten lava spewed out of the nearby Mount Nyiragongo and quickly spread to the town. Approximately 400,000 people were forced to flee and a third of the city was destroyed by the flames. Goma's residents began to rebuild the town after the natural disaster, but the M23 rebel group briefly occupied it in 2012 and waged war with Congolese armed forces. Human Rights Watch documented summary executions as well as numerous cases of violent sexual abuse. Business beginnings . Returning to Goma at 23, Jados saw a very different place to the town she had left. High quality food products were in short supply, as were clean water and electricity. The challenges didn't stop her from focusing on her goal of establishing the first high-end bakery in town. ""Two years before I opened the doors I started raising money,"" she explains. ""I needed to get an oven and mixing machine from Italy."" Another essential ingredient she couldn't find locally was a skilled baker, so she convinced a baker from the French town of Toulouse to move to Goma. ""Young people in Goma aren't well trained or educated,"" she says. ""I want to help young people learn new skills so the baker is training a Congolese baker and a woman who makes cakes."" Jados continues: ""Congolose people are very nice and always smiling. Their current difficulties aren't as bad as they were during the war, so people are very happy. They really want to learn new skills and are very happy to learn from the French baker."" While she can't run her business without materials from abroad, like brown flour and chocolate, Jados uses local products where she can. ""I can find white flour in Goma,"" she explains. ""And the butter I use comes from my family's farm about an hour away. The butter isn't sold in shops, but they produce enough for the bakery."" Heavenly croissants . Like the materials she uses, the customers Jados serves are a mixture of local and foreign. Having experienced such hardship, Goma has become a center for NGOs and charities in the region. The continued presence of expats has impacted the local economy and caused some price hikes for certain services like hotels and drivers. ""In the beginning, most of the customers were expats,"" Jados recognizes. ""But more Congolese people are coming these days -- they like the fresh bread and the birthday cakes as well."" For an expat aid worker living in Goma, ""Au Bon Pain"" is a ""godsend."" She says: ""It's literally the only place in town to get good croissants, tasty sandwiches and genuinely good bread...The only thing they need to improve is the slow service -- if they find a way to make it speedy and efficient, the place will be pretty much perfect."" But not all the issues the aid-workers have come to help resolve are fixed. ""It's hard to set up something that's got good foundations,"" Jados says. ""It is difficult. There's lots of tax which makes things expensive. The electricity always cuts out, so I had to buy a big generator which was expensive and [it] also uses fuel which is very expensive. Water is also a problem."" And if these issues weren't enough, as well as a full-time business owner, Jados is a full-time mum of two. ""I was pregnant when I was setting up the bakery,"" she says. ""I now have a three month year old daughter, and I have to care for her too."" Despite her heavy workload, Jados is resolute that she's doing the right thing. ""We can never be sure the war won't start again,"" she says. ""We don't know, but we must continue. We must do the schools, the hospitals, the restaurants. We have to keep a positive mindset and make sure Congolese people don't go to Europe. Local people need to stay here and create a better Congo.""
