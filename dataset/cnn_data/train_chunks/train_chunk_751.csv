Police are searching for a man suspected of punching at least three people over the weekend in Cambridge, Massachussetts. One of the attacks was caught on a Massachusetts Avenue furniture store's video surveillance. The disturbing footage shows a tall man striding rapidly behind a couple on the sidewalk before coming level with them and punching the man in the side of the head. Saturday stroll: The couple left BoConcept furniture store and turned right onto Massachusetts Ave . Stalked: The suspect can be seen walking up behind the unsuspecting couple . Both the man and woman were knocked to the ground by the punch. According to the Boston Herald, the suspect yelled, 'Oh, you think that's funny?' before punching the man, and kept walking without breaking stride after the attack. Another man reported that the assailant walked straight up to him at around 3:30pm, mirrored his movements as he tried to get out of his way, then punched him twice in the eye. The victim had to be treated in hospital for his injuries. A third man told police he too had been punched in the face with no reason and gave a description matching the suspect's. All three attacks happened on Massachusetts Ave in the afternoon. Ill intent: The suspect was heard shouting 'Oh, you think that's funny?' before punching the victim . Blindsided: The suspect walks level with the couple then winds back and punches the man in the head . Floored: The man and woman both fell to the ground after the attack . Police say the attacks do not appear to be an example of the so-called 'knockout game' in which people hit strangers, videotape the assault and post it online. Investigators suspect the suspect was on drugs or suffering from mental illness at the time of the attacks. Victims say the man was shouting unintelligibly when he approached them. Owner of BoConcept, the store from which the couple had just departed when they were attacked called the attacker 'cowardly.' Daylight attack: The victim can be seen holding his face as a BoConcept employee walks them back into the store to call police . Anthony Goodh told Metro that he's glad his store's surveillance cameras caught the attack on film. 'It’s terrible. You get paranoid and start looking over your shoulder to see who is coming from behind,' Goodh said. 'I hope they identify this person. If he can’t decide for himself that he’s doing something wrong, he’s got to be told so.' Goodh helped two of victims after the attacks. Multiple attacks: The suspect committed all the attacks on a stretch of Massachusetts Ave . 'We ran out to help, brought him inside. This guy had a bruised ear and cheekbone. He was going ballistic. Then the previous victim came in. We helped him, too. He had a big fat lip,' he told CBS Boston. The suspect is described as a tall black man in his 20s. The owner of a nearby restaurant said the suspect had entered his business and made small talk with his chef before swinging at the man missing. The chef gave chase and saw the suspect disappear up Ellery Street.","A man randomly punched three people in the face on Saturday afternoon in Cambridge .

The alleged drug dealer suspected of selling Philip Seymour Hoffman drugs has been closely acquainted with other drug-addicted celebrities who have died from overdoses, including Amy Winehouse and artist Jean-Michel Basquiat. Robert Vineberg, also known as Robert Aaron, has a long list of credits as a musician, and an equally long list of connections to addicted celebrities. Vineberg, 57, has admitted to being addicted to heroin, but denies selling Hoffman any of the drug found in his apartment. Friends in high places: Robert Vineberg at his arraignment on February 5, wearing a Wyclef Jean jacket - just one of the high profile musicians that he has worked with . Art scene: Vineberg 'spent a lot of time doing heroin' in the 1980s with Jean-Michel Basquiat (right, pictured with Andy Warhol) Another acquaintance: Philip Seymour Hoffman was found dead with 70 bags of heroin in his West Village apartment . He is now facing a felony charge of heroin possession with . intent to sell following his arrest on in his apartment on Mott Street in the pricey Nolita district of Manhattan. The Canadian-born musician appeared on the New York scene as a teenager in the 1970s and befriended other artists and musicians. He was a friend of the late New York artist Jean-Michel Basquiat in the 1980s. According to TMZ, the pair spent a lot of time doing heroin together in Vineberg's apartment - the same apartment Hoffman allegedly visited to score heroin. Basquiat died of a heroin overdose in 1988. Vineberg's stepdaughter Christine Soto admitted that Hoffman had visited . the apartment where her stepfather sold drugs before adding: 'But he had . nothing to do with what killed him.' Accomplished musician: Robert Vineberg released his own album, Trouble Man, in 2010 . Known addict: Vineberg worked with Amy Winehouse on her debut album Frank . She said that Vineberg turned to selling drugs to 'pay his rent.' Soto told the New York Post that he had tried to find other work when he had difficulty paying bills as a musician, but couldn't even get hired as a dishwasher. Vineberg and Hoffman were friends for about a year before the actor's death, but Vineberg had not seen him since November, she said. Vineberg, who played with . the singer Amy Winehouse is one of three people arrested in New York for . alleged drug offences following actor Philip Seymour Hoffman's death. The . 57-year-old performed on the popstar's best-selling album Frank in 2003 . and claims to have worked with other singers including Wyclef Jean, . Mick Jagger, David Bowie and Tom Jones. Two law enforcement officials said at least one of them had the actor's phone number. Investigators zeroed in on the four after a tipster, responding to publicity about Hoffman's death, told police he had seen Hoffman at the lower Manhattan apartment building where they were arrested and he believed that's where Hoffman got the heroin, the officials said Wednesday. In searches of two apartments in the building, police found hundreds of packets of heroin in one of them, according to a criminal complaint. Making ends meet: Vineberg's stepdaughter says he sold drugs to pay his rent when he couldn't find work as a musician . Not involved: Christina Soto says her stepfather did not sell the drugs that Hoffman overdosed on . Tip off: Four people were arrested in apartments at 302 Mott Street in lower Manhattan after police were tipped off by a heroin user . 'This case and the charges against Mr Vineberg have absolutely nothing to do with the death of Philip Seymour Hoffman. ... We're hoping the (district attorney) will not use Mr. Vineberg as a scapegoat,' said his lawyer, Edward Kratt, who declined to say whether Vineberg knew Hoffman. On . hearing news of his tragic death on Sunday, Soto remember that her . stepfather said: 'If he would have come to me, I would have told him to . slow down, and if you’re going to do something, make sure you have . someone with you.'

Vineberg was granted bail on February 14 after his February 4 arrest. His lawyer told the judge that the 300 bags of heroin found in his apartment were for personal use. Justice Edward McLaughlin said the claim was dubious. 'If he has an incessant, uncontrolled heroin addiction, then lying around with 300 bags of heroin, he would be dead,' McLaughlin said, reported the New York Post. 'If he has no job that produces income and has $1,500 or $1,300 in cash, you draw your own conclusions.' A group of about 20 musician friends were there to support Vineberg.

Vivienne Westwood rarely puts on a show without a hidden political agenda, and the Red Label Autumn/Winter 2014 collection proved no different. Rather than a discreet nod towards her protest, Vivienne Westwood stamped the words, ‘Fracking We Need to Talk’, across the invitations, and with every guest clutching one, her point was surely made. Front row seats were occupied by quirky dressers  such as Jessie J, Eliza Doolittle and Paloma Faith who were seen giggling together on the front row. The privileged woman was the inspiration behind Vivienne Westwood's Red Label collection . Triangle print tights and large Amish style hats were major trends in the collection . The . collection itself had Westwood written all over it with glorious tartan . featuring heavily as well as folded tailoring and bulging cleavages . evoking classic Westwood womanly design. Vivienne . Westwood’s Red Label line is inspired by women born into a privileged . world, which showed in the lady-like ensembles of the collection. Mid-length . dresses paired with oversized wool coats and ankle socks gave a chic . suburban edge while lashings of pearls and faux fur coats gave a nod to . the Red Label inspiration of the privileged woman. Although . there are none of the explicit doodles printed on t-shirts as seen in . previous seasons, Westwood is never satisfied with a run-of-the-mill . design and each piece had a hint of mischief. The Red Label Autumn/Winter 14 collection showcased a softer side of Vivienne Westwood . The collection displayed a cheekier take on lady-like dressing with bustles sewn into mini skirts . This season Vivienne Westwood wanted to draw attention to Fracking inviting guests to a Frack Future Ralley . Highlights included miniature bustles sewn into the backs of mini skirts (several worn without underwear) as well as a loose-knit cardigan dress worn with nothing underneath giving peaks of bare flesh. The collection also featured the newly trending Amish style hat as seen on the likes of Pharrell Williams; recently earning it’s fashion status on the catwalk of Tibi during New York Fashion Week. We anticipate that it’s only a matter of time before the oversized headgear it filters down to the High Street. Although Vivienne Westwood says the woman who inspires Red Label is privileged she says that this does not prevent her from having a conscience adding that she is ‘engaged with the world and cares about it.’ In hopes to raise awareness about the Fracking, Vivienne Westwood invited all of her guests to the Frack Future Carnival Rally on 19th March at 12:30pm, meeting point at London's Knightsbridge station. Jessie J and Paloma Faith were seen bonding on the front row . Christopher Kane is the King of cool. His AW14 collection of hypnotic neons, inky black patents and feminine floral lace prints, has fast become a fashion week favourite. But Christopher didn't want the hair and make-up to distract from his 54 fabric strong organza dresses. 'Most young designers don't want a huge focus on the hair, they fit the girl to the clothes and want a look that makes the clothes look easier,' Redken extraordinaire, Guido Paolo, told us backstage. 'Christopher didn't want anything too forceful so I've given his models simple, natural hair. It's very undone hair with a great shine and matte texture.' Guido spritzed on some Redken shine flash to give it a more lanky feel. 'I didn't want much body, nothing too romantic, but something cooler, he said. 'This look is all the things a women dreams of becoming; you can be who you want to be, with a little tweaking.' As for the make-up, NARS Cosmetics supremo Lucia Pieroni gave Christopher's models a 'glowing tomboy look'. 'It's Brooke shields meets tomboy. The emphasis is on the eyebrows, I've made them straight and filled them in to achieve a straight, bushy and rather dark look,' she explained. The skin was luminous, simply a swash of the brand's Radiant Cream Compact Foundation and Stick Concealer to highlight and give that 'glow coming out of the darkness.' The eyes were pink and silvery and Lucia carried the pink shadow down to the ball of the nose, the Cupid's bow and chin to give that radiant lightness. Lips were pink, fresh and a little bit matte, courtesy of Bangkok Pure Matte Lipstick. 'This girl is very Christopher. She's a cool girl, it's all very ""him"",' added Lucia.","Vivienne Westwood based her collection around the privileged woman .

'I'm hoping I'll get more auditions and roles if I . look more like Ryan Gosling. That's why I had the surgery.' Before: Nicholas says he wanted more definition in his jaw bone to give a more rugged look... After: A week later, with the swelling and some light bruising down, Nicholas is 'over the moon' with the results . The procedure saw Nicholas receive dozens of injectable fillers with a specific . formulation of non-animal-sourced hyaluronic acid to plump out various . parts of his face. 'I'm secretly excited how woman will react now I look a little bit more . like their celebrity crush' Beverly Hills surgeon Dr Tim Neavin, . who specializes in Hollywood . transformations and facial remodeling, operated on Nicholas on May . 7th. He explained: 'The patient already shares some similarities with Ryan . Gosling, but has some deficiencies, so we built those areas out to give . him that squared-off jaw Ryan Gosling made famous. 'We filled out the temples and put a . little Botox around the brow. Then we injected some product along the . cheek junction, to make it a little smoother,' he said. A-list aspirations: Nicholas and his surgeon Dr Tim Neavin plan how they will make his face more closely resemble that of Ryan Gosling . Major changes: Dr Neavin says he addressed the hollowness in Nicholas's face, and built out the jaw . 'The biggest issue I wanted . to address was the hollowness in the face. We injected more product to . blend it with the cheekbone. The patient's laugh lines were also a . little prominent, so we filled them in to smooth them out - this really . gives the patient a youthful, well-rested appearance. 'He was deficient . in the jaw, along its border, so we basically built out the entire jaw, . squaring it off just like Ryan Gosling's.' That, Dr Neavin says, is the . 'Hollywood' face you'll recognize from screen actors such as Ryan . Gosling or Rob Lowe. 'Their faces are what we call the ""aesthetic . ideal"". Perfection.' No laughing matter: Dr Neavin also addressed Nicholas's laugh lines, which 'were a little prominent,' so filled them in to smooth them out - 'this really gives the patient a youthful, well-rested appearance,' he says . Costly: The entire set of procedures took two hours, and set Nicholas back by $5,000 . And it seems Nicholas is not the only . one who aspires to that look. The surgeon says male patients often . bring photographs of Ryan Gosling into his surgery. 'Ryan Gosling is the . must-have face in America,' he says. 'He is considered to be the sexiest . man in Hollywood, and it's not just his charming smile and blue eyes. 'Gosling's face is what I call an ""architectural masterpiece"" in terms of bone structure, including a squared-off appearance between the cheekbones and jaw bone.' A week later, with the swelling and some light bruising down, Nicholas is 'over the moon' with the results. Just like Ryan: A series of photographs in Dr Neavin's office show Nicholas's transformation . Strong: The surgeon says Nicholas was deficient in the jaw, along its border, so he built out the entire jaw, 'squaring it off just like Ryan Gosling's' 'The first time I looked in the . mirror I was shocked at how much of a change it was, I looked so much . healthier too,' he says. The American Society of Plastic . Surgeons says the number of procedures in men has increased over 106 per . cent since 1997, and reports a sharp rise in facial rejuvenation. The organization says that men had . almost a million cosmetic procedures in 2012, including . minimally-invasive treatments, which have become . increasingly popular among those who aspire to the 'Hollywood look'. 'It was really shocking. Now, every morning, I . have to check in the mirror to make sure it's still there!' He . says the similarities to the Hollywood actor are now unmistakable: 'I . went to a pool party this week, like we do here in LA, and this girl . came up to me and she said, ""you have a very Ryan Gosling look to you."" I . couldn't believe it! After all the stuff I had gone through, it was . amazing.' Nicholas says the operation has not just made him look better, but feel better. 'By getting the procedure done it's definitely increased my . confidence,' he says. 'I just look healthier, you know? Before I felt . like my face was a little narrow and now I feel like the world is my . oyster.' Nicholas adds that he is already picking up more work since his transformation. 'Over the moon': Nicholas can't contain his smile as Dr Neavin examines his new face . More confident: Nicholas thinks he looks healthier and says he is already experiencing a career boost . 'Before now, my career was quite slow, but I'm just getting . started,' he says. 'I've worked on a couple of television shows, and I just landed a . new show.' And as well as his career, Nicholas . is keen to see how his new face will go down with the female population: .

The California Highway Patrol was mourning the loss of two officers Monday after their squad car flipped over while responding to a multi-vehicle crash. Officers Brian Law, 34, of Clovis, and Juan Gonzalez, 33, of Fresno, were heading to the crash on state Route 99 near the Central Valley town of Kingsburg when they swerved to avoid a person in the road and lost control of the vehicle, the CHP said. California Governor Jerry Brown and first lady Anne Gust Brown sent their regards Monday to the fallen officers and their loved ones. Flags will be flown at half-staff at the State Capitol in Sacramento. In the line of duty: Highway Patrol officers Brian Law, 34 (left), and Juan Gonzalez, 33 (right), were killed Monday while responding to a multi-vehicle car crash near Kingsburg, California . This is the scene on state Route 99 where two California Highway Patrol officers were killed in a vehicle accident in Kingsburg, Calif., Monday, Feb. 17, 2014. CHP identified the officers as Brian Law and Juan Gonzalez. Their squad car flipped over Monday while responding to a multi-vehicle crash. (AP Photo/The Fresno Bee, Mark Crosse) 'Anne and I extend our deepest condolences and sympathies to the families, friends and colleagues of Officers Law and Gonzalez as they mourn the tragic loss of these dedicated public servants,' Brown said in a written statement. 'We join all Californians in honoring these officers for their courage, commitment and service.' Law and Gonzalez were traveling southbound to get to the crash, CHP Capt. Dave Paris said. The original pre-dawn collision about 25 miles southeast of Fresno was initially reported on the northbound side of the divided highway, Paris said. The officers soon realized, however, that the crash scene was actually in the southbound lanes, and one the drivers involved was on the road, Paris said. Gonzalez, who was driving, swerved out of the way, and the squad car hit a guardrail and struck the pylon of a freeway exit sign, said Officer Axel Reyes, a CHP spokesman. Quick turn: Gonzalez was driving the squad car and swerved to avoid a crash victim walking in the middle of the freeway . The original crash apparently occurred when a pickup truck driver fell asleep at the wheel and crashed into the center divider, the CHP said. It came to rest in the wrong direction with its lights off, setting off a chain-reaction collision. 'Prior to our arrival, it appears another vehicle may have hit the truck' and came to rest a short distance away, CHP Commissioner Joe Farrow told reporters in a briefing at the crash site. 'We're not sure if the officers ... thought the crash was further down the road,' Farrow said. '(But) as they approached the scene, they lost control of their vehicle. They hit the guardrail and ultimately hit the sign.' It is standard procedure for the two officers to be in the same car because they were working the graveyard shift, said Reyes, the CHP spokesman. Both Law and Gonzalez were wearing their seat belts, said Paris, the CHP captain. Asleep at the wheel: The crash the officers were responding to occurred when a pick-up driver fell asleep at the wheel and crashed into the center divider . The two officers graduated from the CHP academy in 2008. They are the first officers from the Fresno CHP office to die in the line of duty since Jerry E. Turre was struck and killed by a hit-and-run driver while laying flares at an accident scene in 1962, according to CHP records. Farrow said Law and Gonzalez were good friends and partners who trained together. Now, their colleagues from across the state have to deal with their loss. 'It's draining â€” a lot of the officers are drained,' Reyes said. 'Officers are having a tough time â€” some more than others.' Law started his career in Oakland before transferring to Fresno about a year ago to be closer to his wife and three kids, said Officer Sean Wilkenfeld, a CHP spokesman who worked with Law in Oakland. 'He was just a really fun, easygoing guy,' Wilkenfeld said. 'He was sort of quiet, big into sports, and always willing to help out.' Close: California Highway Patrol spokesman Axel Reyes (pictured) said the partners were good friends who trained together . Before transferring to the Fresno area in 2010, Gonzalez worked for CHP in San Jose for two years. He is survived by his mother, a sister and a girlfriend. CHP Officer Ross Lee, who worked the graveyard shift with Gonzalez in San Jose, said Gonzalez, who had served as a field training officer, was a good mentor. 'He was a great guy with a very calm demeanor, a good officer who took the time to make sure he and others did their jobs correctly,' Lee said. 'A stand up guy.' Wilkenfeld said both officers will be missed by the entire CHP. 'I can't count how many lives they made better,' Wilkenfeld said. 'This is a huge loss for us and the communities they served. We know what we do can be dangerous.' The CHP's accident reconstruction teams remained at the site Monday afternoon to scour for evidence. One southbound lane was open and traffic was moving slowly, the CHP said.","Officers Brian Law, 34, and Juan Gonzalez, 33, died while heading to the crash site near Kingsburg .

Zara, 32, also plumped for a characteristically practical look and wrapped up warmly in a cosy blue padded jacket and a pair of sturdy brown boots. Zara looked fresh-faced and healthy and beamed broadly as she watched the racing action unfold.

Admirers: She's less than a month old but little Mia seems to have plenty of fans already . All OK? Zara takes a peek at her tiny sleeping daughter to make sure everything is OK . Zara, who is a trainer in addition to being a successful eventer, had three horses entered for the event, among them, the hotly tipped Devils Boy [sic].

A former actress claims she didn't know her husband murdered the 27-year-old mother of his two young children until he pushed her to help hide the body parts more than a week later. Amanda Hayes, 41, took the stand in her defense, saying she only agreed to help hide the chopped up body parts of Laura Ackerson when her husband Grant threatened to kill her as well. But prosecutors said Hayes never tried to expose her husband's heinous act, and even seemed happy in pictures taken after they disposed of the body . More than that, they say the couple planned the murder after a troubled custody battle over Grant's two young sons with Ackerson. Murderer? Prosecutors say former-actress Amanda Hayes, 41, helped her husband murder the mother of his two children in the midst of a bitter custody battle . Gruesome: Pieces of Laura Ackerson's body were found in a Texas creek 11 days after she was murdered at the Raleigh apartment of Grant and Amanda Hayes . Hayes is facing charges of first-degree murder and accessory after the fact for the July 2011 death. Her husband Grant was convicted last year of murder and is currently serving a life sentence. After closing statements Monday, a North Carolina jury began deliberations. They will meet again to discuss the case Tuesday morning. Hayes' defense attorney asked the jury to acquit his client on both charges, saying her 'classic sociopath' husband acted alone in the murder and Hayes was forced to help hide the body parts when threatened the lives of her and the children. When Hayes took the stand, she described the night of Ackerson's death. Arrested: Amanda's husband Grant Hayes (left) was found guilty of murder last year and is currently serving a life sentence in prison. Amanda's mugshot on the right . According to Hayes, Ackerson had come over to their apartment and Grant grabbed Ackerson, causing the 27-year-old to fall and hit her head. That's when Hayes grabbed the children and left the apartment so that Grant could call an ambulance. Unbeknownst to Hayes, by the time she got back Grant had strangled Ackerson to death with an apple adapter chord. At some point he smuggled her body out of the house wrapped in a carpet to chop up the body and store the pieces in coolers. It wasn't until six days later, on July 18, that Hayes had realized what her husband had done. The couple and the children had taken a trip to visit Hayes' sister in Richmond, Texas and drop off some furniture. Getting rid of the other woman: Prosecutors say Hayes and her husband killed Ackerson in the midst of a bitter custody battle over Ackerson and Grant's two young sons . Loving mother: Laura Ackerson, 27, on holiday with one of her sons . 'He's concealed everything he's done from Amanda,' her attorney said. 'She arrives in Texas, happy, content to see her sister without any hint whatsoever that Grant has killed Laura.' Grant stored the coolers with Ackerson's body parts in them behind some of the furniture they shuttled in a rented U-haul van. She only agreed to help hide the body when her husband threatened her life, as well as the lives of their children. Hayes says her husband told her 'none of us were going to make it back to North Carolina' if she didn't help get rid of the body. Pieces of Ackerson's body were found 11 days after the slaying in a creek near Hayes' sister's house. Happy couple: Grant and Amanda Hayes pictured with the daughter they had together (left) But prosecutors say Hayes' story 'is so ridiculous' and makes 'zero sense'. Ruined plans: Prosecutors also say that the Hayes became annoyed at the prospect of having to split custody with Ackerson, which would mean they couldn't relocate to the Virgin Islands for Grant's music career . They say there is a clear motive behind the murder, since the couple had become frustrated during the custody battle over Grant's 2- and 3-year-old sons with Ackerson. A court-appointed attorney was about to recommend split custody, and the Hayes didn't want to be ferrying the kids back and forth. Plus, the decision would mean the family wouldn't be able to relocate to the Virgin Islands for Grant's music career. 'Amanda Hayes and Grant Hayes decided that they were going to kill Laura and erase her, that she was going to stop being the barrier and anchor that kept them here and kept them going forward,' Assistant District Attorney Becky Holt said. Even if she wasn't directly involved in Ackerson's murder, prosecutors say she definitely acted as an accessory and didn't make any attempts to bring her husband to justice for his crime. While Hayes claims she was afraid for her life and under duress after hiding Ackerson's body, prosecutors point out that she didn't make any attempt to flee from the situation. When she met with police alone two days before her arrest, she wouldn't give them any information on the murder. 'She had multiple, multiple opportunities to go and flee a situation that she claimed was marked with duress,' Holt said. And then there are the pictures of Hayes, her husband and the kids on their way back from Texas. In the pictures, Hayes appears happy and beaming next to her family - not the markings of a woman under duress, prosecutors said. 'What you've experienced is a fine acting job. Amanda Hayes has come before you and has tried to sell you on a role,' Holt told jurors. 'She was not afraid of Grant Hayes then. She was not afraid a year later. She's given the performance of her life.' Jurors will first have to decide whether Hayes is guilty or not guilty of murder. If they decide she is not guilty they will then have to decide whether she is guilty of accessory to murder. She can't be convicted of both.

A man has told how he is refusing to leave the home he was born in 62 years ago despite the council flattening the surrounding 600 houses. Charlie Wright has turned down numerous offers from the council to move from his childhood home in Birkenhead, Merseyside. But he is not budging from the home, even though he has no neighbours and no community. Resolute: Charlie Wright is now the last resident left in an old council estate in Birkenhead which was once made up of 600 homes . Isolated: Chalie Wright's home is the only landmark on a desolate stretch of scrubland left after the council estate was demolished . All alone: Mr Wright's home, circled in red, is now the last inhabited building on a site where once stood 600 homes . Mr Wright said: 'I was born in this house and I have been here for 62 years. 'My mum got the house after the War and she brought ten of us up in here. I’m the last one and I’m staying here. 'This was one of the best estates ever. We had everything but now we have nothing, not even neighbours. 'I used to have hundreds of neighbours but now it’s just us.' Mr Wright’s house is bookended by two partially demolished buildings and lies on a street surrounded by wasteland. Occupied: In the 1960s, the street was full of houses . Last man standing: Charlie Wright refuses to leave the house where he was born 62 years ago despite requests from the council to vacate the property . Bygone times: It was a thriving road which had a cafe and had a steady flow of traffic . Changed: This is how the land around Ilchester Road looked in 1936. Most of the housing has now been demolished . Despite not being much to look at, he loves his home, and his sense of pride can be seen through the flagpole flying a Union Flag in his back garden. Having been born and bred in the home alongside his nine brothers and sisters, his family eventually bought the house from the council. But Mr Wright is refusing to give it back without a fight. Home sweet home: Charlie Wright has lost all of his neighbours as, one by one, their homes have been knocked down by the council . Determined: Mr Wright has refused to leave the house he bought off the council without a fight . He said: 'I don’t need anyone to fight my battles but if the council wants a war, it’s got a war because I’m staying here. 'At one time around here, everyone had families. They grew up and stayed for years and there was real community spirit. Alone: Mr Wright grew up on the estate playing with friends in the street by now has no neighbours . 'There were nice five-bedroomed houses and people like living here. I look around now and can’t believe it’s all gone. The situation angers and upsets me. 'The reason given by the council when they wanted to clear the area was that there was too much housing stock and no-one to live there. 'That’s rubbish, because I have spoken to friends who used to live here, who say they would give anything to move back - if there was anything to move back to. The estate, which lies near to Birkenhead’s docks, was once a sea of 600 post-war houses, home to thousands of workers who sustained the manufacturing and shipbuilding industries. Plans were put into place to clear homes to make way for new factories, but the jobs and investment failed to materialise, leaving the area desolate and unkept. While 14,000 people from the estate were once employed in the industrial sector, this dropped to just 1,300 by the mid 1980s, causing the area to slip towards poverty - however there was still a sense of community for families. Mr Wright, a former boilerman and shop steward, said: 'We use to play on these streets as kids. Kids grew up, got married and got a house on the estate. Their kids would go and see their gran. 'I had three uncles and aunties on streets nearby. All of our family was brought up on this estate and I’m the last one out of the lot. 'At the end of the day if I had to move out, I don’t know what I’d do or where I’d end up,' he said. 'I have been offered other places to live, but none of them have been any good.'","Charlie Wright has lived in the same house in Birkenhead for 62 years .

An unnamed man has sworn on behalf of socialite Taylor Stein that William Lauder, 53, offered him cash and a job in exchange for making 'false and misleading statements' about Stein. Litigation between Lauder and Stein has been unending since the 2007 birth of their daughter and has even seen Stein arrested for domestic battery after she punched her billionaire ex in the face. Bitter feud: Socialite Taylor Stein (left) and billionaire cosmetics heir William Lauder (right) are embroiled in years-long litigation that began after Stein had their baby in 2007 . According to the complaint filed in California, the man claims Lauder offered him cash and 'other valuable considerations'--a job, according to Page Six--to make injurious claims against Lauder's lover turned courtroom foe. The latest turn comes as Stein--daughter of legendary rock promoter Howard Stein--fights for ownership of the Los Angeles home he purchased for her and their daughter. While he reportedly promised the home to her, Lauder says Stein has since violated the terms of their support agreement. Saga: Stein (at right with Tara Guber at left and Linda Thompson at center) has been fighting for ownership of the Los Angeles home Lauder purchased for her and their daughter Djuna, who was born in 2007.

Not going hungry: William Lauder, pictured with his father Leonard and cousin Aerin Lauder Zinterhofer, at a cosmetics industry event in 2011. Forbes lists Leonard's worth at $7.4 billion . Documents filed on behalf of Stein claim . the 40-something socialite was ''further damaged by causing her to . retain the services of a [retired] Los Angeles district attorney to . disprove the statements obtained by W.

Not long after the childâ€™s birth, Lauder agreed to pay Stein $9.5 million through to the year 2017 on the proviso that she moved to California and wouldn't visit New York for more than two weeks a year. She also had to alert him six weeks in advance before her trips east. Stein has since had to take Lauder to court after he attempted to renege on the deal. The New York Post reported in August that Stein punched Lauder in the face after the pair got into an argument on an L.A. street in November 2012. Despite, or perhaps because of their history, Lauder choose to press charges and Stein was arrested and later released on $50,000 bail. She subsequently pleaded guilty to misdemeanor domestic violence and was fined $1,834 and sentenced to 19 days of community service - cleaning streets for the California Department of Transportation.

Peter Johnson, Jonathan Mathew and Stylianos Contogoulas are accused of conspiring to defraud between June 1 2005 and August 31 2007. The arrests come more than 18 months after Barclays was fined £290m for rigging Libor, which is used to set mortgage rates and trillions of dollars of financial contracts around the world. Scandal: The bank was fined £290m in 2012 for rigging the Libor interest rate (file photo) The SFO launched a criminal probe into the scandal shortly after the fine was announced. Johnson and Mathew left Barclays in September 2012 while Contogoulas left in 2006 after four years at the bank. The three were among 104 names of current and former Barclays employees who tried to keep their identities anonymous as part of a legal case brought by Guardian Care Homes. The charges take the total number of individuals facing criminal proceedings for their role in the Libor scandal to just six, despite a number of banks including Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS being hit with huge fines. No-one has yet been jailed. Tom Hayes, a former trader at Citigroup and UBS and brokers James Gilmour and Terry Farr were charged last year. The criminal proceedings against the . Barclays alumni comes as it is also being investigated by regulators . over whether it manipulated foreign currency rates. The . arrests will come as an unwelcome distraction, with the bank under . pressure to justify a bumper pay hike for investment bankers and lay out . its plans to turn around performance. Review - Martin Wheatley, Managing Director of the Financial Services Authority, said the Libor rate itself needed a 'complete overhaul' following the scandal which implicated a number of banks . The decision by the scandal-hit lender to increase its total bonus pool by 10pc to £2.38bn has put it on a collision course with shareholders. Barclays (up 3.05p to 256.05p) has kicked off a two-week charm offensive to attempt to pacify investors ahead of its annual general meeting in April. The High Street giant is desperate to avoid a backlash, particularly as shareholders have this year been given binding votes that allow them to block remuneration reports. A key issue at Barclays’ investors’ roadshow is likely to be why it sanctioned big increases in bonuses despite disappointing performance. Its ‘casino bankers’ enjoyed a 13pc pay rise, sharing bonuses of £1.57bn between them. The huge windfall, which equates to £60,100 on average, was unveiled last week and came as the investment bank’s profits slumped 37pc to £2.5bn. The key ‘compensation ratio’ - pay as a proportion of revenue - rose from 39.6pc to 43.2pc, despite Jenkins’ pledge to reduce it to the mid-30s over the next few years. Insisting that the bank was on track to meet this target over the ‘medium term’, Jenkins sought to justify the bonus bonanza. Proceedings: UBS (pictured) was also hit with a huge fine and former trader Tom Hayes has been charged . He argued the bank needed to ‘pay competitively’ and backed ‘pay for performance’, adding that this ‘was in the long term interests of shareholders’. Jenkins added that Barclays has been struggling to attract and retain some of its top talent, particularly when competing against Asian and US rivals. He indicated that he had received the approval of some the bank’s biggest shareholders. But analysts predict many investors will be less understanding when given the chance to vote on the pay packages at the annual meeting. Describing the bonus hike as a ‘poke in the eye for investors’, Gary Greenwood from Shore Capital said: . ‘Barclays has not done itself any favours with the increase in the bonus pool, particularly at the investment bank. It has a lot of work to do to convince investors that they needed to pay more to retain top staff and must provide evidence of the revenues these top staff are generating.’ He added: ‘Barclays also needs to convince investors about its plans to boost performance at the investment bank. It has its work cut out’. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","The men are Peter Johnson, Jonathan Mathew and Stylianos Contogoulas .

Aldi has beaten Waitrose and Marks & Spencer to be crowned the nation’s favourite supermarket, according to the annual Which? survey. Customers voted it the best supermarket as it provided value for money and helped to ‘ease the impact of increasing food prices on day-to-day budgets’. The supermarket narrowly beat Waitrose, which has been voted the best UK supermarket every year since the survey started in 2007. Number one: Aldi has beaten Waitrose and Marks & Spencer to be crowned the nation¿s favourite supermarket . High quality: The report said Aldi's customers love its pricing, fresh food and range of products . The authors wrote: ‘Aldi customers love its pricing and also rate it highly for the quality of fresh food, its range of products and how easy it is to find items. ‘The single most important factor for shoppers when deciding which supermarket to buy from is that it offers good value, and [customers] clearly see Aldi as number one in this department. Bargain hunting has become such a national pastime that the thrifty . middle classes are now spending £20  a week in pound and 99p . stores. They are not just shopping in Aldi and Lidl, but are supplementing their weekly shop with even cheaper deals. Memories of a deep recession and a fear that hard times could return have led to an obsession with finding the best value. A . new report by Rowan, a specialist discount wholesaler, shows 63 per . cent of us now shop in places such as Poundland or 99p Stores. And it is certainly not the preserve of those on lower incomes. In fact, 49 per cent of those in households earning 50,000 pounds or more shop in them. ‘Shoppers told us that supermarkets generally aren’t helping to ease the impact of increasing food prices on their day-to-day budgets. But Aldi is a rare exception - 80per cent think it’s helping with this.’ More than 7,000 shoppers were asked about how satisfied they were as customers and whether they would recommend a supermarket to a friend. They were then asked to score supermarkets on pricing, customer service, the quality of fresh produce, the store environment, how well-stocked they were and how easy it was to find items. Aldi came first at 76per cent, followed by Waitrose at 75per cent and Marks & Spencer at 73per cent. Next in line were Lidl, Iceland, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons. Tesco, the country’s biggest supermarket, scored just 57per cent in terms of customer satisfaction. The Cooperative was last of the big supermarkets at 50per cent. Ocado came top of the ‘online only’ category, receiving a score of 78per cent for customer satisfaction followed by Waitrose at 73per cent and Sainsbury’s at 73per cent. The authors said: ‘Aldi has earned the top spot in the Which? supermarket survey, and value for money is the biggest reason why. ‘Aldi received a maximum five-star rating for pricing and special offers, and almost all of its customers (96per cent) said that it offers good value for money - more than any other supermarket in our survey.’ They added: ‘But Aldi wouldn’t be loved by its customers if it was just cheap. It was also rated highly for filing [customers’] trolley and the quality of its fresh food.’ Losing out: Waitrose has dropped to second place have previously been named Britain's best supermarket every year since 2007 . Last year, Waitrose scored 82per cent while Aldi scored 74per cent. Tesco came last at 45per cent. The Which? survey also revealed that supermarket customers’ biggest pricing irritation is when products are mislabelled as being on offer. The consumer group said it was meeting with major supermarkets and Government to campaign against changes to misleading multibuy offers. Which? executive director, Richard Lloyd, said: ‘With rising food prices, one of consumers’ top financial worries and household budgets being squeezed, it’s no surprise that the supermarket that scored the highest on value for money was rated the best in our survey. ‘People tell us their biggest bugbear with supermarket pricing is confusing labelling on special offers, so we want supermarkets to treat their customers fairly by scrapping misleading price promotions and make special offers special.’","Customers speak of their love for its pricing and the quality of fresh food .

Investigation: Culture secretary Maria Miller, who is at the centre of an expenses row about her property, could be sitting on a £1million profit on its value . The Cabinet minister at the centre of an expenses row about her property could be sitting on a £1million profit on its value, it has emerged. Maria Miller, the culture secretary, is being investigated for claiming £90,000 in taxpayer-funded allowances for a home where her parents also lived. The minister and her husband Iain bought the large detached house in Wimbledon, south London for just £234,000 in 1995. She has charged the taxpayer for mortgage repayments and various other expenses since she became an MP in 2005, designating it her second home, with her main home a rented property in her Basingstoke constituency. It is now worth an estimated £1.27million, according to the property website Zoopla. Its value has surged by £220,701 in just one year, adding a fifth to its value, the website estimates, and if rented out it would fetch around £4,700 a month. The rules state that second homes must be ‘exclusively’ for the use of MPs. Mrs Miller is being investigated for her claims from 2005 to 2009 by the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner, who has sent a 100-page report into her conduct to MPs. In it, the Commissioner Kathryn Hudson is understood to have concluded that for at least part of the four years Mrs Miller should not have claimed second home costs for her London home, where it understood her family live. After a cross-party group of MPs scrutinise the report, they have the power to suspend her or order her to repay her expenses. Claims: Ms Miller is being investigated for claiming £90,000 in taxpayer-funded allowances for her London home while she was also renting properties in her Basingstoke constituency, including this barn . Mrs Miller became notorious after one of her special advisers threatened reporters investigating her bosses’ expenses that Mrs Miller was involved in implementing the Leveson report. The warning has been seen by many as a salutary indication of the dangers of politicians regulating the press. Forced to resign: Labour MP Tony McNulty had to resign as London minister and repay £14,000 after he claimed for a home where his parents lived . Sources close to the minister say she believes she has done nothing wrong, and pointed out that her expenses have been audited twice in the wake of the expense scandal in 2009 and no wrongdoing was found. She claims her parents moved into the house to help her look after her three children. But Labour MP Tony McNulty had to resign as London minister and repay £14,000 after he claimed for a home where his parents lived during the expenses scandal. But the prime minister is said to be keen for her to stay in post given she is one of just four women in his cabinet. If she were to sell the home, Mrs Miller would be entitled to keep the £1million profit under parliamentary rules. When the expenses scandal was exposed, it emerged she had claimed £190 for repairs to carpets and £90 for garden work, while a claim for crockery was turned down by the fees office. Last year it emerged in figures released by the parliamentary watchdog Ipsa that 20 MPs had made a profit by selling their taxpayer-funded second homes - prompting calls for them to pay the money back.","Maria Miller investigated for claiming £90,000 for house where parents lived .

But that was in the 1960s, when the river was regularly dredged. Now, as the residents of Burrowbridge are all too aware, the width of this stretch of the River Parrett has practically halved. The way we were: In the 1960s, a wide expanse flowed along the River Parrett in Burrowbridge, Somerset . Ticking clock: But as this recent photo shows, years of poor dredging caused earth to build up on the banks . Doom: So when the rains kept coming, the water had no way out other than to burst the banks . As a result it regularly bursts its banks, flowing over and around the bridge instead. In startling contrast to today's scenario, the picture, taken five decades ago, shows a wide expanse of water passing through Burrowbridge with plenty of room for water levels to rise. A matching image taken shortly before the recent floods reveals how silt and debris have gradually built up and extended towards the centre of the river. The overflow holes in the sides of the bridge which were once above the water line now sit redundantly in the side of the banks, surrounded by grass and mud. Critics blame the Environment Agency - which took over responsibility for river maintenance around 20 years ago - for failing to dredge regularly. Bryony Sadler, 38, a founding member of the Flooding on the Somerset Levels Action Group (FLAG), from the drenched village of Moorland, said: 'The photo speaks for itself really. End of the line: Some of the overspill from the River Parrett on the Somerset Levels, causing mayhem . 'It shows the massive build-up that you get when you don't dredge . 'Looking at that photo is looking right at the problem. 'It shows perfectly the scale of neglect by the Environment Agency, and shows what we have been saying all along.' The mother-of-two added: 'We have got to have dredging and it has got to be done properly. No half measures. No sorry excuses.' Parts of Burrowbridge and its surrounding villages have been under water since the start of the year. The rivers were once managed by the National Rivers Authority who regularly cleared silt and debris from the waterways, until responsibility passed to the Environment Agency. Torrent: Pumps are in full flow at Dunball, Somerset, removing water from the King Sedgemoor drain and back into the River Parrett, but there are still millions of litres to clear as the risk of disease grows . Hard at work: Dutch engineers install the remaining pumps at Dunball, near Bridgewater in Somerset . The FLAG group has obtained rainfall records for the area around the Parrett and Tone for the last 20 years. They reveal between December 1993 and February 1994 around 20 inches of rain fell - five inches less than during the same time this year. A spokesman for the group said: 'So roughly the same rainfall but far more flooding now. 'What has changed? Dredging seems to be the biggest obvious difference between then and now.'","Wide expanse flowed through Burrowbridge on River Parrett in Somerset .

For a string of middle-aged single women struggling with their finances, he seemed to be a knight in shining armour. Having met Christian Barber on a dating website and fallen for his charm, he would reveal that he was an £118million lottery winner with a fleet of luxury cars. And, what’s more, he wanted to pay off all their debts. But Barber was in fact a homeless conman who travelled across the country in his VW Golf, a court heard, gaining the trust of vulnerable women before raiding their bank accounts. Lesson: Victim Christine Spencer, 57, (left) was duped by Christian Barber on a dating website . The 41-year-old – who claimed to own a . hotel complex in Barbados and a large house in the exclusive Cornish . resort of Rock – swindled more than £45,000 from at least six women, . between September 2011 and March 2013. After . meeting on popular dating sites – including Plenty of Fish – and . gaining their trust, he told them he would help with their financial . problems. But once he had their bank details, he would secretly steal large amounts of money from them. The . conman showed the women photographs of at least eight luxury cars he . supposedly owned – including Maseratis and Porsches – but he in fact had . no permanent home and the only vehicle he owned was a 2003 VW Golf. One . victim gave up her rented house believing they were moving in together, . while another broke off a long-term relationship to be with him. And . one was left by the roadside after believing she was about to be taken . on the holiday of a lifetime – only for him to drive off in search of . his next victim. On Friday, . Barber admitted eight charges of theft, three charges of fraud and a . charge of making off without payment for hotel accommodation. Yesterday . he was jailed for 59 months. His victims came from towns  across the country, from Yorkshire  to Cornwall. Wendy . Stubbs told the Mail how  she was so convinced by his fake  identity . after meeting him in July 2011 that she quickly introduced him to her . parents, her three grown-up children and friends. ‘My . family thought he was amazing – as did I. He was charming and . complimentary and seemed very genuine,’ she said. Like many of the other . women he seduced, he only told Miss Stubbs he was ‘secretly wealthy’ around three weeks into the relationship, saying he wanted to attract . the ‘right kind of woman’ and not someone looking for money. Devastated: Wendy Stubbs' house was also ransacked by Barber . Around . the same time Barber – who also claimed he was a member of the . upmarket  Barbour clothing company dynasty – offered to help with her . finances. He told the . 48-year-old driving instructor from Grantham that he hated to see her in . so much debt and that he wanted to pay off all her credit card bills – . and pretended to do so in front of her on the phone. But . instead, he began gradually stealing small amounts from her savings . account as well as pretending to ‘invest’ large amounts of her money. Six weeks into the relationship – and still unaware of the money that he . had slowly  stolen from her – the conman promised to whisk Miss  Stubbs . to Dubai. But after waiting . in vain at her daughter’s house for him to pick her up, she returned . home to find it had been ransacked and he had stolen several family . heirlooms. ‘I was devastated,’ she said. ‘I feel like I’ve been to hell and back and I don’t think I can trust anyone again.’ She claims he stole £20,000 from her in total. Another . victim, Christine Spencer, 57, from Derby, told the Mail last night how . Barber stole more than £11,000 from her over the course of their . five-month relationship. Scam: Barber used sites like Plenty of Fish to meet vulnerable women and eventually run off with their money having seduced them with elaborate lies . Around three weeks after meeting in January 2012, he told her he wanted to invest her money in his Barbados hotel business. ‘I . was to head up this operation on a salary of £100,000 to recruit and . train the employees,’ the learning and development professional said. ‘This of course never happened. I gave him my money and he “invested” it.’ The . divorced mother of three added: ‘I have moved on and learnt to evaluate . people more closely. This is a lesson for other women to be careful. ‘I would never have thought I’d be sucked into such a  scam but  he seemed completely genuine.’ Lincoln . Crown Court heard that Barber had 16 previous convictions dating back . to 1993 for offences including deception, fraud and burglary. Recorder . Gareth Evans QC told him: ‘You chose vulnerable victims. You moved from . one victim to another when the money ran out. It was just a way of . living for you. ‘You set out the bait. They took the bait and you then took their money, their dignity and their self-respect. ‘They would be left by the side of the road as you drove off to your next victim. It beggars belief.’ Sentencing: The judge at Lincoln Crown Court gave the 'conman' almost five years in prison for his fraud .","Christian Barber lied that he was worth £118m thanks to Euromillions win .

Concerns: Dr Chaand Nagpaul, of the BMA's GP committee, said the Government¿s public information campaign for Care.data had 'clearly' not worked . Plans to harvest patients’ private medical data were in crisis last night after the main doctors’ union voiced ‘deep concerns’. The British Medical Association, which represents 150,000 doctors, urged officials to delay the scheme – warning that patients had been left in the dark. It said surgeries across the country were being contacted by countless members of the public demanding to know what was going to happen with their confidential medical details. It emerged yesterday that NHS England – which is overseeing the Care.data project – had accepted there was a risk the database could be hacked into and used ‘maliciously’. The Royal College of GPs voiced similar concerns last week and said the scheme had created a ‘crisis in public confidence’. Such interventions from leading medical bodies have thrown the project into chaos just weeks before it is due to begin. Starting next month, officials will begin extracting information about illnesses, prescriptions and test results from every patient’s file unless they have opted-out. NHS officials say the details will be used to identify pockets of poor care but there is concern they will fall into the hands of hackers and insurance firms. The BMA is to hold urgent discussions with NHS England later this week about how to better inform patients. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, of the BMA’s GP committee, said the Government’s public information campaign for Care.data had ‘clearly’ not worked. ‘With just weeks to go until the uploading of patient data is scheduled to begin, patients remain inadequately informed about these proposals,’ he said. ‘GPs across the country are telling us that large numbers of their patients have not received any information, and therefore remain completely unaware that their data will be uploaded, whilst others remain worried about who will have access to it and what it will be used for. ‘The BMA continues to support the principle of using anonymised data to plan and improve the quality of NHS care for patients. However this must be done with the support and consent of the public.’ It is thought that leaflets dropped through doors last month may have got lost or thrown out with junk mail. Anger: Several GPs' groups have now spoken out over the planned changes by the NHS (photo posed by models) The Mail reported yesterday on a survey of 667 GPs which found that 8 in 10 did not fully understand why the NHS needed to harvest the data. NHS officials say the information will be stored anonymously with only a patient’s date of birth, postcode and NHS number kept on file alongside medical details. But experts say it would take only two hours for insurance firms, for example, to track down patients based on these details alone. Potentially they could raise patients’ premiums based on their medical conditions or family history of illness. Roger Goss, of Patient Concern said: ‘If surgeries are forced to release patients’ medical records without their properly informed consent, it will make providing good care even more difficult than it already is. ‘People will withhold everything that they fear may get into the wrong hands. Diagnoses will become even harder and slower.’ While a risk assessment document produced by NHS England had accepted the information could be used ‘maliciously’, Tim Kelsey, its national director for patients and information, insisted there were safeguards in place to prevent this.","BMA, which represents 150,000 GPs, has urged government to delay rollout .

He bit her repeatedly for five seconds, before pushing her against a wall and bending her arm backward. Dr Richardson, also 51, a public health specialist, was left with a cheek injury and £500 worth of damage to her glasses following the attack. Strickland - who works for the NHS in Salford, Trafford and Bolton - admitted assault and criminal damage at Manchester magistrates' court last month. However, he escaped jail today after District Judge Paul Richardson praised his 'courage' for pleading guilty - instead, sentencing him to a six-month community order, costs of £85 and a £60 victim surcharge. The assault took place in January after Strickland, who is also an 'honorary' university lecturer, discovered Dr Richardson was in a relationship with another man, the court heard. He left seven voicemail messages on his estranged wife’s phone, before deciding to confront her at her new boyfriend's home. Strickland, who specialises in providing services for people with mental health, banged on the front door, but noone answered and he left the scene.

He then pushed her against a wall, before breaking her glasses . Appearance: Strickland, 51,  pictured outside court last month,  pleaded guilty to assault and criminal damage . However, trouble erupted later that afternoon when Dr Richardson went to her the psychiatrist's home on Clothorn Road. David Graham, prosecuting, said: 'He . opened the door and immediately began an assault - pushing her onto a . wall and biting her cheek for five seconds before pushing her backwards . against the car. He took glasses off her face and snapped them causing . £500 damage. 'As a result she was left with a bite mark to her cheek. This could be seen as a high level assault of its type.' Brigid Baillie, defending, said . Strickland had been on anti-depressants for two years following the . breakdown of his 20-year marriage in 2010 and subsequent divorce in . 2012. Case: The psychiatrist escaped jail today after District Judge Paul Richardson praised his 'courage' for pleading guilty - instead, sentencing him to a six-month community order, £85 costs and a £60 victim surcharge . 'He came off them in November last year . and that was when things began to get on top of him,' she said. 'Things . built up and he didn’t deal with them. He was experiencing stress at . work. His mother has dementia and he has power of attorney. He would sometimes gets phone calls from the police about her going missing. 'He also felt his ex-wife had been gloating over the new relationship. At the time her new partner was a mutual friend.' She added: 'He feels . ashamed and very regretful it happened in the first place. There is . genuine remorse. He . is in a relationship and wants to move forward.' Street: Brigid Baillie, defending, said Strickland had been on anti-depressants following the breakdown of his marriage in 2010 and subsequent divorce in 2012.  Above, Clothorn Road, where the attack took place . At an earlier hearing, the court was told the couple . had . been married for 20 years, but had split up acrimoniously due to Strickland's 'increasingly controlling and jealous' behaviour. He had reportedly assaulted his wife in 2009, but she had made no complaint at that time. Sentencing Strickland, Judge Richardson said: 'Much of the background is very sad but it is not unique. People go through stuff a good deal worse than you have suffered and it does not result in violence. 'You had the courage to plead guilty. With your background, it makes it more difficult to face up to what has happened. 'I’m hoping you will find value in this because you are in new territory with people who find themselves in circumstances such as this more than you.' Strickland now faces a . disciplinary investigation by the General Medical Council and has been . referred for psychiatric treatment over his behaviour.","Paul Strickland discovered wife Judith Richardson had a new boyfriend .

A headteacher who expelled a six-year-old boy after he brought in Mini Cheddars for his packed lunch fed pupils food from McDonald’s, it was revealed today. Jeremy Meek ordered the notorious junk food for youngsters at Colnbrook Church of England Primary School in Berkshire, just weeks before kicking out a pupil in a row over healthy eating. Pupil Riley Pearson was expelled earlier this month following the fall-out over his lunchbox. His four-year-old brother Jayden also had his place at the pre-school withdrawn by the headteacher. Mini Cheddars: Pupil Riley Pearson was expelled earlier this month following the fall-out over his lunchbox . But it has now emerged that the school bought around 100 children McDonald’s meals for lunch after a break-in at the school at the end of the Christmas term had left the canteen out of action. Riley’s father Tom Pearson said: ‘It is just so hypocritical and makes me really angry at their double standards. There were five dinner ladies working. ‘Why didn’t they go to the shop a few minutes’ away, get some bread and make some sandwiches if they are so concerned about healthy eating? McDonald’s is junk food, pure and simple. ‘The headteacher is happy to feed kids with fast food - (but) kicks Riley out for having Mini Cheddars. The way Riley, Jayden and my family have been treated is a complete disgrace.’ However, Mr Meek responded by saying: ‘The school was broken into last year and as a result we were unable to use the school kitchen that day. ‘We were faced with trying to source approximately 100 hot lunches for our pupils at very short notice. The school opted for fish finger meals from McDonald's. Decision: Jeremy Meek ordered the notorious junk food for youngsters at Colnbrook Church of England Primary School (pictured) in Berkshire, just weeks before kicking out the pupil in a row over healthy eating . ‘This was before the introduction of our healthy eating policy in January and avoided the pupils not being provided with any kind of meal.’ Mr Pearson and Riley’s mother Natalie . Mardle, who is pregnant, have started a petition calling for the . youngsters to be reinstated at the school. It has so far attracted . around 1,500 signatures. 'The headteacher is happy to feed kids with fast food - (but) kicks Riley out for having Mini Cheddars' Tom Pearson, father of Riley Pearson . The parents argue that the school has no right to dictate to them what they should feed their children, and also maintain that Riley is a healthy weight for his age. They insist they sent him to school every day with a balanced lunch of orange squash or water, a sandwich, an apple or banana and cream cheese dunkers or Mini Cheddars. The school introduced a healthy eating policy at the start of term with a letter to parents outlining that chocolate, sweets, crisps and fizzy drinks were not allowed. It added: ‘It your child’s lunchbox is unhealthy and unbalance they will be provided with a school lunch for which you will be charged.’ Mr Meek said Riley’s parents were repeatedly warned about the contents of his lunch box, including at a face to face meeting. Choice: The headteacher said the school was 'faced with trying to source approximately 100 hot lunches for our pupils at very short notice' - and 'opted for fish finger meals from McDonald's' (file picture) Riley was excluded for four days before being told he was not allowed to return to his classmates. A statement from the school said: ‘We . have not excluded a pupil for just having mini cheddars in their . lunchbox, but where there is a persistent and deliberate breach of . school policy, such as bringing in crisps, biscuits, sausage rolls, mini . sausages, scotch eggs and similar, and all other avenues have been . exhausted, the Governors would expect further action to be taken. 'We were faced with trying to source approximately 100 hot lunches for our pupils at very short notice. The school opted for fish finger meals from McDonald's' Jeremy Meek, headteacher . ‘If we are faced with a situation where a parent threatens to send a pupil into school with insufficient food to sustain them throughout the school day, it is a risk we simply cannot afford to happen.’ It added that the decision to permanently exclude a pupil was taken due to persistent breaches of school policies and a pupil’s parents making it publically clear that their child would not follow the policy. The school said the parent-school relationship suffered an ‘irretrievable breakdown’ that would put the two pupils in an unacceptable position. It added: ‘This breakdown was due to misrepresentations in the local and national media that were both wholly inaccurate and grossly misleading, abusive language being used towards staff, and other inappropriate actions being taken that were designed to damage the school’s reputation.’","Headteacher Jeremy Meek ordered fish finger meals for schoolchildren .

A pensioner who was blinded by a police water cannon flew to Britain to confront police over plans to bring in the controversial weapon last night. Dietrich Wagner, 69, was left with just five per cent vision in both eyes after being blasted at close range by water cannon during an environmental protest in his hometown of Stuttgart, Germany about a train station development. The force of the jet of water fired from just 15 feet away tore his eyelids, irreparably damaging his eyes and fracturing the orbital bone around the eye. Mr Wagner, 69, suffered terrible injuries from a water cannon at an environmental protest in his native Germany. Pictured is a water cannon being used during a recent protest in Turkey . Mr Wagner said of the incident on September 30, 2010: 'It was like a punch in the face. 'The punch was crammed with pain. 'I can remember falling over backwards. It went very quiet and I lost consciousness. 'When I came around all I could see was black. I remember screaming, ""help me I can't open my eyes"".' Surgeons battled to save the retired engineer's sight but after six operations to reconstruct his eye socket, he can now only make out dim shapes. Yesterday he flew from Germany to London to address a public meeting debating the use of the tactic in Britain. He said: 'Water cannon are dangerous and they cannot solve social issues. 'They are costly and unnecessary. I worry that people like me could be injured like me. 'It is my duty to make the people of London aware of how lethal these weapons are. 'Before my injury, I had no idea of the damage they could cause. 'I am lucky to be alive. Doctors said that if it went on for a minute more, the force of the water would have caused brain damage.' Disorder: After the riots of August 2011, Scotland Yard boss Bernard Hogan-Howe has been calling for officers to have access to the high-pressured cannon . He added: 'The police also need to know what this will mean for their relationship with the public. 'They used to be respected and seen as a force for good in Stuttgart. But since 2010, this relationship has been damaged beyond repair, and there is now a deep mistrust and hostility towards the police by most people in the city. 'The use of water cannon is akin to the breakdown of the democratic process. I strongly urge the Mayor of London, Theresa May and London's police not to introduce this weapon.' London Mayor Boris Johnson wants Britain's biggest police force to be armed with the fearsome weapon by the Summer. In the wake of the riots of August 2011, Scotland Yard boss Bernard Hogan-Howe has been calling for officers to have access to the high-pressured cannon to quell possible future outbreaks of disorder. More than 35,000 people have signed a petition against the plans . But the Home Secretary Theresa May has refused to fund it as a 'national asset' for forces. Now Boris Johnson is pressing ahead with a public consultation on the scheme, telling the Home Secretary he is happy to fund the machines after receiving assurances from the Met Commissioner that they will be 'rarely used and rarely seen' only in the most extreme circumstances. More than 35,000 people have signed a petition against the plans and last week the London Assembly voted against the Mayor's proposal to spend Â£200,000 on three second-hand German water cannon. Among those who voted against the scheme last Friday were four key Conservative members including Kit Malthouse, the former deputy mayor for policing and James Cleverly, the chairman of the London fire authority.","Dietrich Wagner, 69, was virtually blinded at environmental protest .

A man who thought he was getting a tattoo of a Chinese symbol on his back was in fact being inked with a 40cm-long penis. The cruel prank in Queensland, Australia, cost a backyard tattoo artist and his assistant jail time and left the victim a broken man. On Friday Christopher William Lord, 23, was sentenced in Ipswich District Court after pleading guilty to assault occasioning bodily harm while armed and in company. He was sentenced to 12 monthsâ€™ imprisonment with a parole release date of March 12. Request: The victim agreed to being tattooed on his back, but was shocked to learn from friends he had a 40cm-long penis inked instead . Lord was charged with assisting friend Matthew Francis Brady, 24, tattoo a 40cm-long penis on another manâ€™s back after the group spent an afternoon drinking at Bradyâ€™s Ebbw Vale home in October 2010. Brady was sentenced in 2011 for his role in the crime. He received 12 months in prison, suspended after three months, and three years probation. At the time Brady pleaded guilty to assault occasioning bodily harm while armed, assault occasioning bodily harm and performing a high-risk service without holding an infection control qualification. While the three men were drinking, Brady and Lord convinced the victim to let Brady tattoo him. Agreeing to have a yin yang symbol with a dragon and tiger tattooed on his back, Brady and Lord took him into a bedroom to do the tattoo. Zen: In addition to a dragon and tiger design, the victim also agreed to have a yin-yang symbol . Lord further encouraged the man to go through with the tattoo, telling him about a girl who would have sex with him if he had it done. Starting the tattoo, Brady's design was wildly different from what they agreed on, drawing a penis, testicles and a misspelled slogan under it implying the man was gay. After complaining the tattooing had hurt, the victim asked Brady to stop, but he continued, with Lord insisting the tattoo looked 'mad' and reassuring him that Brady was starting to draw the dragon after finishing the ying yang symbol. When the tattoo was finished, Lord told the victim to cover the tattoo. The three men then went into the backyard, where Brady again accused the man of raping a girl. The victim again denied this, before being assaulted by Brady. After fleeing the property, the victim showed the tattoo to friends, who told him it was a drawing of a penis. The Sydney Morning Herald reported the victim was horrified by the tattoo at the time it was done in 2010. Ipswich Detective Constable Paul Malcolm said it was not what the victim was looking for. 'The victim wasn't interested (in a tattoo) at first but he was talked into it and he said he wanted a yin and yang symbol with some dragons,' he said. Thankful: After not getting the tattoo he asked for, an Ipswich tattooist offered to cover the penis for free . 'The bloke started doing the tattoo and there was another bloke standing there watching saying, ""Mate, it's looking really good"".' 'He was told not to go out into the sun and not to show anyone for a few weeks. When he got home he showed it to the person he lives with and she said: ""I don't think it's the tattoo you were after"". An Ipswich tattoo artist has since covered up the penis tattoo after donating his services to the man. The court heard at the time of the offence Lord was on bail for armed robbery, which he was sentenced for after this offence took place. A Gold Coast church where Lord works tendered a reference to the court on his behalf. Judge Greg Koppenol described the tattoo as 'appalling' and said Lord and Brady had taken advantage of a vulnerable man. 'It was a miserable offence,' Judge Koppenol said. 'You acted miserably towards a vulnerable young man with a significant disability.'","Two men convinced a man to let them tattoo his back after drinking .

Labour has drawn up plans to ‘decapitate’ the Liberal Democrats by ousting Nick Clegg from Parliament at the next election. Ed Miliband yesterday issued a humiliating public rebuff to the Lib Dem leader after he hinted he would like to form a coalition with Labour after the next election. And a source on Labour’s ruling National Executive Committee told the Daily Mail the party was now ‘pouring resources’ into Mr Clegg’s Sheffield Hallam constituency in a bid to get him booted out by the voters next year. Embarassing: Ed Miliband (left) yesterday issued a humiliating public rebuff to Nick Clegg after he hinted he would like to form a coaltion with Labour after the next election . ‘We are going to go after Clegg hard,’ the source said. ‘We are already pouring resources in because although he’s got a big majority it is very soft. 'A lot of them are students and there is a huge amount of anger locally about the Coalition’s cuts.’ Another Labour source said the party was aiming to produce a ‘Portillo moment’ - a reference to Michael Portillo’s shock defeat at the 1997 election which ruled him out of the subsequent Conservative leadership contest. The revelation threatens to plunge relations between Mr Clegg and Mr Miliband into the deep freeze at a time when the Lib Dem leader is trying to reach out to Labour about the possibility of forming a coalition after next year’s election. In an interview for a BBC Radio 4 documentary broadcast yesterday Mr Clegg said Labour had ‘changed’ and suggested the party was becoming more responsible on the economy. The Lib Dem leader was also scathing about his Tory coalition partners, saying they had lurched to the right and lost touch with the concerns of ordinary voters. Ideology: In an interview for a BBC Radio 4 documentary broadcast yesterday Mr Clegg said Labour had 'changed' and suggested the party was becoming more responsible on the economy . ‘They’ve become much more ideological,’ he said. ‘They’ve returned much more to a lot of their familiar theme tunes. ‘I think it would be best for everybody if the Conservative Party were to rediscover a talent for actually talking to mainstream voters about mainstream concerns.’ Mr Miliband yesterday rejected Mr Clegg’s overtures, saying he was focused on securing a Labour victory next year. ‘I think what I’m looking for is a majority Labour government,’ he said. ‘There are such big issues that the country faces, I think Nick Clegg should be worried about the Liberal Democrats.’ When pushed on whether he would consider a coalition with the Lib Dems, Mr Miliband said: ‘I don’t think the parties, in advance of elections, should be engaging in this. I think what they should be engaging in is how are we going to change the country? What are we offering the country? And that’s what I’m interested in.’ Many senior Labour figures see Mr Clegg as an obstacle to a potential coalition deal. They argue it would be impossible for a man who has propped up a Conservative Prime Minister for five years to ever be accepted into a Labour-led government. Previous efforts: The last party to attempt a 'decapitation strategy' was the Lib Dems, who tried to oust the then Tory leader Michael Howard during the 2005 election . Removing Mr Clegg from Parliament would force him to quit as Lib Dem leader, leaving Labour to deal with a more palatable figure if the election produces another hung parliament. Mr Clegg has one of the safest Lib Dem seats in the country, with a majority of 15,000. Labour has never won the seat. But the constituency also has one of the highest concentrations of student voters in the country. Labour believes many of them remain furious with Mr Clegg for his betrayal over student tuition fees. Ironically the last party to attempt a ‘decapitation strategy’ was the Lib Dems, who tried to oust the then Tory leader Michael Howard and senior figures, including David Davis and Oliver Letwin at the 2005 election. The initiative was largely unsuccessful after Tory activists flooded the targeted constituencies to shore up their vote.","Ed Miliband issued a humiliating public rebuff to the Deputy Prime Minister .

His pair of six-figure pay deals at the BBC have earned him the nickname ‘Two Jobs’ from his colleagues. But Alan Yentob has defended his generous remuneration, saying: ‘It’s not a double salary, it’s half a salary.’ The 66-year-old earns £183,000 as the corporation’s creative director and a second pay packet, thought to be around £150,000, for presenting the Imagine arts series. But he said the only reason people criticise his role is because he is ‘easy to take the p*** out of’. ‘I’ve been here for a long time, I’ve run all the channels, people have heard of me. I sound like I have famous friends, I’m easy to take the p*** out of,’ he told The Guardian. 'Every day I walk through the streets, I don’t see that resentment - only from certain bits of the press, I think.' ‘Let’s look at this double salary thing. If you look at my salary for the executive role it’s half what you would expect it to be. I’ve got a relatively thick skin. I have to put up with it. I know from my colleagues that they like working with me and there’s no hierarchical feel with me.’ On top of his total earnings of around £330,000, Mr Yentob – who has been at the BBC since 1968 – is believed to have a pension pot worth £6million. He has repeatedly argued the BBC is right to pay its stars high salaries to allow it to compete with its commercial rivals. And in his latest interview, he said the same principle meant the publicly funded organisation should not always be transparent about the way it operates. He said: ‘[The BBC] can’t compete with its hands tied behind its back and being told: ""You can’t pay the talent this and you’ve got to disclose everything you do"". The BBC has to be as open as it can possibly be but it also has to be able to operate.’ Famous friends: Yentob with Rod Stewart for an Imagine... documentary . Mr Yentob added: ‘[Television] is increasingly a global industry. What the BBC does for Britain and can do for Britain, if that is to be sustained it needs to be funded adequately.' When asked about the string of recent crises at the BBC – from the Jimmy Savile scandal to the £100million Digital Media Initiative fiasco – he responded said people needed to be given credit for 'owning up'. Despite his defensive stance, Mr Yentob did admit the BBC is currently failing in one area: the number of women and ethnic minorities it puts on air.

A mother has been fined £500 after her son spent just three days in school out of a possible 118, it was revealed today. Nicola Duke was one of three parents prosecuted last week for failing to ensure their child attends Furness Academy in Barrow, Cumbria, and she was fined £500 plus £120 of other costs. But figures obtained since the conviction showed her son spent just three days in school between January and July 2013. Truant son: Nicola Duke was one of three parents prosecuted last week for failing to ensure their child attends Furness Academy in Barrow, Cumbria, and she was fined £500 plus £120 of other costs . The figures also revealed how a fellow pupil had a 26 per cent attendance record - spending 30 days at school out of 118. That pupil's father, Christian Ryan, 37, was fined £1,170 including costs. And Karen Bromley pleaded guilty to failing to make her son attend Furness Academy and was given a 12-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay a £15 victim surcharge. The figures show her son had an attendance record of 22 per cent - meaning he was at school for 26 days out of a possible 118. Last month, Furness Academy revealed that Des Herlihy, who was appointed interim headteacher in June 2013, will remain as executive principal until July 2015. School: Nicola Duke's son spent just three days at Furness Academy between January and July 2013 . Responding to the prosecutions, Mr Herlihy said: ‘We do not comment on individual cases. Parents of children aged five to 16 are legally responsible for ensuring they attend school regularly - unless they are home educated. Headteachers, social workers or police can issue parents penalty notices of up to £100 if a child regularly misses school, and their parents have not taken action or asked for help. If this is not paid, a prosecution will follow - and this can lead to a fine of up to £2,500, a three-month jail term or a community sentence. Council officials say that, aside from their education suffering, children who are often absent find it harder to sustain friendships, and are more likely to get involved with crime. Good attendance at school is essential to ensure progress and enable children to reach their full potential. ‘At Furness Academy we are committed to good standards of attendance and we will use the legal processes open to us to achieve this.’ A spokesman for Cumbria County Council added: ‘Schools and the local authority work closely with families when there are attendance issues and we do all we can to improve attendance and stress the negative impact truancy can have on a child’s education. ‘While we always look to resolve attendance issues through having discussions and offering support, these three cases send out a message that we will prosecute as a last resort when other methods for improving attendance fail.’","Nicola Duke is one of three parents prosecuted over truancy in Barrow .

The spending was revealed as it emerged International Development Secretary Justine Greening has warned ministers that frivolous spending was undermining the case for foreign aid. And it makes a mockery of David Cameron’s claim this week that none of the £11billion aid budget can be diverted to help British flood victims without hitting the world’s poor. The Daily Mail has highlighted the plight of those whose lives have been made a misery by UK flooding and almost 250,000 have now signed our petition calling for overseas aid funds to be used for flood relief and defences. Meanwhile, Miss Greening has written to every member of the Cabinet warning them that aid spending must be targeted to ‘where it is needed most'. She is said to be particularly concerned that some climate change projects risk undermining public confidence in the foreign aid budget. The latest Government figures reveal that in 2012 Britain sent £27.4million to China – despite it sitting on more than £2trillion in foreign exchange reserves. Some £22.5million was provided by the Foreign Office, with the remainder coming from the Commonwealth Development Corporation, which is owned by Miss Greening’s Department for International Development (Dfid).

They include a £100,000 initiative to ‘upgrade’ industrial parks to help them reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, while £70,000 has gone on promoting the idea that China should enact a law to limit emissions.

The tone of Miss Greening’s letter is likely to raise eyebrows in Whitehall, where Dfid is facing serious questions about its own  budget management. China, which sent a mission to the moon in December, is one of 16 countries that supposedly had its aid programme ‘axed’ in 2011. But the latest Dfid figures reveal 15 of those were handed £131.9million between them in 2012.

Pledge: Ed Miliband said if he won the next election, 200,000 homes would be built by 2020 . Labour yesterday outlined controversial plans to create four new towns to plug the housing shortage in southern England. Ed Miliband, who has promised to build 200,000 new homes a year if his party wins the next election, made clear that new towns and garden cities were key to the plans. But he also attacked ‘home-blocking’ local authorities who refuse permission for new houses, promising to take action to force them to accept some new developments. Mr Miliband says that London’s position as a global business capital is under threat because of the lack of affordable housing for young people. He called for the ‘next generation of new towns’ to be built within commuting distance, but in ‘sustainable locations’ that are resilient to flooding. It is understood that up to four will be built, with at least one intended to take the heat off London. ‘I have made a firm promise: under the next Labour government Britain will again be building nearly 200,000 homes a year by 2020,’ wrote Mr Miliband in yesterday’s London Evening Standard. ‘A key plank will be creating new towns in sustainable locations where people want to live, just like earlier generations did in places such as Stevenage and Milton Keynes. ‘Labour will kick-start the next generation of new towns and garden cities around the capital to ease the pressure on London. Some of the new housing needed will come from taking action against home-blocking local authorities that have frustrated planning proposals from neighbouring authorities for years.’ A spokesman for the Campaign to Protect . Rural England agreed that more homes needed to be built, but added: ‘The . challenging questions are where they should go and who will build them, . and perhaps as crucially, how you are going to get local support. Development: The new towns would be similar to Stevenage, which saw a huge spike in population during the 1960s and 1970s . Growth: Milton Keynes was developed in the 1960s after the government said a generation of 'new towns' was needed in the south east . ‘This is an on-going debate on how best to meet our housing needs while protecting the countryside. The important thing is that they cannot be imposed on communities.’ Garden cities were a concept of urban planning which became popular in the early twentieth century and built at Letchworth and Welwyn in Hertfordshire. They are intended to be self-contained communities surrounded by green belt to combine the best of town and country living. Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said yesterday that the Government was speeding up housing compared to when Labour was in office. ‘We’re taking the difficult decisions to deal with Labour’s mess – delivering hundreds of thousands of new affordable homes through proper investment and fixing the planning system,’ he said.","Opposition leader has promised to build 200,000 homes a year .

Sally sually avoided the scales, and was appalled to discover her weight had shot up to more than 11st . Sally Edwards was in for a shock when the nurse at her asthma clinic asked her to step on to the scales. 'My . doctor had retired and I changed to a new surgery where they had an . asthma clinic,' says Sally, 45, a hairdresser from Aldington in Kent. 'They . saw on my notes that I suffered from asthma, but this was the first . time anyone in the medical profession had weighed me.' 'She took a sharp breath and made a face, so I knew it wasn't good news,' says Sally. Like . many women, she usually avoided the scales, and was appalled to . discover her weight had shot up to more than 11st. At only 5ft 2in tall . this made her officially obese. 'The problem was that I didn't feel . fat because the weight had crept on so gradually during and after my . pregnancies,' says Sally. 'Then when the children left things on their . plates, I'd pick at the leftovers.' Sally was also struggling . increasingly to manage her asthma, making simple tasks such as walking . up the stairs and looking after  her children, Maizie, now 12, and . Merrin, nine, more difficult. The asthma clinic nurse advised her to . lose weight and said it would reduce her asthma symptoms. It was a real . wake-up call, says  Sally. 'I knew that I had to do something about it . or my asthma would just get worse because I would become more immobile . and reluctant to exercise.' There is a clear link between obesity and . asthma attacks, as Deborah Waddell, clinical lead nurse at the charity . Asthma UK, explains: 'Obese people find their asthma much harder to . control.' It seems they don't respond as well to treatment as people . who are a healthy weight. Indeed, a recent study by Royal Brompton . Hospital in London, involving more than 600 patients at severe asthma . clinics across the UK, found that patients with a BMI of more than 30 . were more likely to need the steroid prednisolone - used to reduce . inflammation in the airways - and to resort to their inhalers more . often. But as Dr Andrew   Menzies-Gow, a consultant in respiratory . medicine at Royal Brompton, says: 'Unfortunately, one of the . side-effects of prednisolone is increased appetite and weight gain, so . patients are more inclined to find activity difficult. 'It's a vicious circle, but if  an asthma sufferer can break that cycle and lose weight, the benefits will be obvious.' Sally's . asthma started when she was 19, triggered by a severe bout of flu. Upper respiratory infections are often caused by cold and flu viruses . and are a common trigger of asthma. Sally lost a stone-and-a-half and it made a huge difference, bringing the asthma under control . 'I had the flu jab when I was 19, but I was one of the unlucky people who contracted the flu badly,' she says. Her . asthma started to affect her daily life. 'Getting up the stairs was . very scary because the wheezing was so loud.  And it stayed at the same . level in my 30s and into my 40s. I couldn't run after the children at . the park.' Since being diagnosed with asthma, Sally has used a brown . preventer inhaler each morning to build up a constant level of . protection and a stronger, fast-acting Ventolin version when symptoms . worsen. This would tend to happen in winter, and also if she was . stressed or had been in contact with pet hair, particularly rabbits. As . well as losing weight, Sally embarked on an exercise regimen - which . can be a brave step for an asthma sufferer, as many worry that increased . activity will spark an attack. The amount spent on treating and caring for people with asthma each year . But, in fact, exercise is good for . asthmatics because it improves their lung capacity. Done carefully, it . shouldn't be risky. And, for Sally, the regimen has been a life-changer. After seeking advice from the Asthma UK website, she took up jogging. As . well as running four miles three times a week, she started going to a . weekly spinning class, while cycling short distances instead of using . the car soon became part of  her routine. 'I lost a stone-and-a-half in eight months and it made a huge difference,' says Sally. 'It . really brought the asthma under control and made the attacks less . frequent and less severe - I have  just one a month instead of three a . week.' She can now also run up  the stairs. 'When I was 11st,  my . body was struggling to  cope with the weight, especially climbing . stairs, but the fitter you are, the stronger your  lungs become.'Sally's experience is backed up by Asthma UK. 'If . you can exercise, this will expand the airways, and improve your lung . function,' says Deborah Waddell. 'Following a low-fat, low-sugar diet . and getting rid of weight, especially around the middle, will make a big . difference. It's all about changing your behaviour and lifestyle.' Andrew . Menzies-Gow suggests that people with asthma should look closely at . their whole lifestyle, stop smoking, avoid pets which aggravate the . condition, and take up exercise gradually, especially walking, swimming . and cycling. When it comes to exercise, he recommends taking a . friend with you when you first start, stopping your work-out to rest if . wheezing starts and choosing gentle, age-appropriate exercises to begin. 'Weight loss and exercise are not a magic bullet for asthma, but they can help enormously,' adds Dr Menzies-Gow. As for Sally Edwards, she's delighted that her asthma is now under control. But that day at the asthma clinic is so vivid and humiliating that she still steers clear of the scales.'I still don't weigh myself very often, but now I have a pair of size 12 jeans and I try them on once a week. 'I know that if they don't fit then I have to try just that bit harder to keep the weight off,' she says.

Around 30 headteachers are being paid more than the Prime Minister in defiance of new rules designed to curb huge salaries. Outrage over soaring public sector pay packets previously led the Government to say that they should generally be lower than the Prime Minister’s salary, who earns £142,500 year. And last week the School Teachers’ Review Body (STRB) said that heads could receive up to £132,685 in exceptional circumstances, rising to £141,250 in inner London. But the guidance from the independent STRB said that normally, the maximum pay for someone in charge of ‘multiple very large schools’ should be £106,148 or £113,000 in central London. However the Daily Mail can reveal that up to 31 headteachers already receive more than David Cameron. Four are paid at least £170,000, while another 13 get more than £150,000 and 14 have an income of at least £140,000. The superhead salaries top a table of 830 school leaders on six-figure sums. And at least 230 teachers are known to be earning £110,000 or more. The surge in numbers is believed to have been fuelled by the rise of academy schools in recent years, which are centrally funded but free from local authority control, giving them power over areas including staff pay. There are around 3,600 at present, up from 2,600 a year ago – suggesting that more headteachers will now be earning bumper pay packages. These could act as a drain on public finances for decades to come, as many heads retire on taxpayer-funded pensions which are worth half their salary. The figures also show that senior teachers – including headteachers and deputy or assistant heads – earn £61,000 on average. At academies the figure is around £1,000 more. However ordinary full-time teachers are paid an average salary which is worth under £38,000. Jonathan Isaby, from the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Good headteachers, especially the ones that are turning around poorly performing schools, will attract a premium. Desperation: State schools are increasingly asking for donations from parents, it has been claimed . ‘But parents and taxpayers should be able to routinely scrutinise pay deals so they can judge for themselves whether they’re getting good value for money.’ And Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT teaching union, said: ‘School leaders have highly responsible and important jobs and their salary should reflect this. ‘But the combination of increased autonomy for schools and weak governance is failing to provide the appropriate regulation and scrutiny to ensure that headteachers’ salaries are determined in an open, fair and transparent manner. The opportunity for abuse is significant.’ A spokesman from the Department for Education said: ‘We asked the School Teachers’ Review Body to make recommendations to ensure pay is always appropriate to the set of challenges the headteacher faces and the contribution they make to the school they lead.’ However the spokesman stressed that schools needed to be given some freedom over salaries in order to be able to recruit and retain the best candidates.","Four are paid at least £170,000 and another 13 get more than £150,000 .

President Francois Hollande appealed to foreign business to invest in France yesterday as his unpopular government tries to spur growth and create jobs. Hosting 30 heads of French units of foreign companies at his Elysee Palace, Hollande pledged that taxes would not rise later and VAT and duty rules for firms would be streamlined this year. The Socialist president, who last month announced France would phase out £25billion in charges on companies by 2017 to reverse its slide in competitiveness, also said French business taxes would be harmonised with those of its neighbours, especially Germany, by 2020. French President Francois Hollande pledged that taxes would not rise later and VAT and duty rules for firms would be streamlined . 'The objective is to ensure the stability of tax standards and mechanisms,' Hollande told leaders of Siemens, Samsung Electronics, Volvo, General Electric and Nestle, among others. 'I know that France, and this was confirmed by our discussions, is seen as a more complicated country than others. 'A business, whether French or foreign, that wants to invest will have a commitment from the administration that the tax rules will remain the same, and that will be a guarantee.' The government believes a rebound in company investment can help boost growth in France’s Gross Domestic Product to at least 0.9 per cent this year after stagnation in 2013. It hopes that even such modest growth will help bring down joblessness from near 11 per cent. France has a reputation for tense industrial relations and frequent run-ins with business. File picture . Monday’s meeting aimed to reassure foreign business leaders unnerved by France’s high overall tax rate, history of tense industrial relations and frequent run-ins with business such as his government’s threat in 2012 to nationalise an ailing steel plant run by ArcelorMittal. But his comments to the business leaders came the same day as a new law was introduced in parliament to impose tough fines on firms that shut operations still deemed economically viable. The law was prompted by Hollande’s 2012 campaign promise to steelworkers at ArcelorMittal’s Florange blast furnaces in northern France that he would pass legislation to protect their jobs in case of a shutdown. Despite a government threat to nationalise them, the furnaces were later closed.","Embattled French president hosted 30 top international executives .

Scientists have long warned that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from bleaching, caused by rising water temperatures . But there is a bigger risk to the colourful coral – and it comes in the form of exploding populations of carnivorous starfish. Crown of thorns starfish have an enormous ‘appetite for coral flesh’ and each adult can chomp through up to 10 square metres of precious coral tissue every year. Voracious: Crown of thorns starfish (pictured) have an enormous 'appetite for coral flesh' and each adult can chomp through up to 10 square metres of precious coral tissue every year . Acanthaster planci, commonly known as the crown-of-thorns starfish, is a large, multiple-armed starfish (or seastar) that usually preys upon hard coral. The crown of thorns receives its name from venomous thorn-like spines that cover its upper surface. It is one of the largest sea stars in the world, the largest being probably the sunflower seastar . The adult crown-of-thorns is a carnivorous predator that usually preys on reef coral polyps. It climbs onto a section of living coral colony using the large number of tube feet on its oral surface and flexible body. It fits closely to the surface of the coral - even the complex surfaces of branching corals - and extrudes its stomach out through its mouth over the surface to virtually its own diameter. The stomach surface secretes digestive enzymes that allow the starfish to absorb nutrients from the liquefied coral tissue. This leaves a white scar of coral skeleton which is rapidly infested with filamentous algae. Researchers at Australia's Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) in Queensland, north-east Australia, have mapped the dinner plate-sized starfish’s pattern of destruction. They said that there is around half as much coral cover in the region as there was 27 years ago and the destruction of the reef is continuing at an alarming rate. Dr Katharina Fabricius, coral reef ecologist and AIMS principal research scientist told the BBC World Service’s Discovery programme that crown of thorns starfish are a bigger problem than bleaching. Corals are bleached when they are . stressed by changing conditions – such as the rising temperature of . water – and expel the algae living in their tissues, which causes them . to turn white. ‘There are three main sources for the coral decline, one is storms, however 42 per cent is attributed to Crown of Thorns Starfish - and just 10 per cent due to bleaching,' she said. Mapped: Scientists mapped Crown of Thorns populations. Blue dots indicate an area free of infestation, green recovering populations of coral, yellow a young colony of starfish and red an active outbreak of the predatory animals . ‘This compares with 70 per cent due to bleaching for reefs elsewhere in the world, such as in the Caribbean.’ The starfish are a ‘major cause for coral loss’ and Australian scientist are now looking at ways to control the destruction they are wreaking by smothering coral and eating their flesh. They think the population explosion could be down to starfish larvae thriving when their phytoplankton food is present in high concentrations after flooding. Starfish larvae-friendly nutrients are being produced in vast quantities as a result of excessive fertiliser being used by farmers – particularly in Queensland where sugar cane is grown - that washes into the rivers and runs into the sea. By looking at how the larvae live in a lab and analysing historical flood records, the scientists think the higher rate of survival of larvae when nutrients are readily available spawns the transportation of millions of them by ocean currents to the reefs where they settle, grow up and feast on the coral in vast numbers. Destruction: Scientists say that there is around half as much coral cover in the Great Barrier Reef (pictured) as there was 27 years ago and the destruction of the reef is continuing at an alarming rate . While crown of thorns starfish have always been present in the reef and their populations have fluctuated, scientists agree that the time between population explosions has lessened dramatically. The abundance of nutrients has boosted the number of starfish larvae surviving into adulthood. In times of phytoplankton famine very few survive, but as each female can produce between five million and 20 million eggs, starfish epidemics can be massive in numbers. Scientists say the starfish are ‘a major threat to the long term viability of coral reefs’ and a new and effective way of controlling the invasive species is desperately needed. Root of the problem: Starfish larvae-friendly nutrients are being produced in vast quantities as a result of excessive fertiliser being used by farmers - particularly in Queensland where sugar cane is grown - that gets into the rivers and runs into the sea, particularly in times of flooding (pictured)","Crown of thorns starfish have an enormous .

Addressed to 'Mrs Symonds', the letter from Lewis Carroll explains his 'disliking' for 'strangers hearing of my real name' His classic tales have been loved by generations of children the world over. But Alice in Wonderland author Lewis Carroll once revealed he wished he had never written his popular books, because he hated the fame their success brought. In a previously unseen letter to a close friend, the famously private author, whose real name was Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, discussed his ‘intense hate’ of being recognised by strangers. The handwritten note was penned in 1891, almost 30 years after the publication of his most celebrated literary work. It is addressed to Anne Symonds, the widow of eminent Oxford surgeon Frederick Symonds, and was written in his rooms at Christ Church college where he was a mathematics don. A prolific letter writer, he told Miss Symonds how he hated his correspondence falling into the hands of collectors, who might identify him as Lewis Carroll. ‘All that sort of publicity leads to strangers hearing of my real name in connection with the books, and to my being pointed out to, and stared at by strangers, and treated as a 'lion'. ‘And I hate all that so intensely that sometimes I almost wish that I had never written any books at all.’ The letter, written in November 1891, was penned 26 years after the publication of Alice in Wonderland, when he was 59. It is owned by a private collector and is expected to fetch up to £4,000 when it is auctioned at Bonhams next month, 116 years after the author’s death. Dodgson was notoriously shy and often refused to sign autographs. In the later stages of his career, he would send collectors who contacted him about his work a printed note denying any connection with Lewis Carroll. The letter will be auctioned alongside this picture of a girl known as Winnie Johnson which was taken by Lewis Carroll and is eerily similar to his photos of Alice Liddel, who his book was based on . He wrote Alice in Wonderland  after telling stories to a girl named Alice Liddell while on picnics and boating trips with her family. Her father was Dean of Christ Church college and Dodgson was a close friend of the family until there was a mysterious cooling of relations in 1863, when she was 11. In 2008, another letter from  Dodgson came to light in which the lifelong bachelor appeared to address speculation about whether he was a paedophile. In the missive, he discussed his fondness for children. The author hated anyone knowing about his private life and never gave interviews. Following his death aged 65 in 1898, pages from his diaries were censored or destroyed, and none of his ten siblings ever spoke about him to outsiders. Dodgson based his book on Alice (pictured), after telling the story to her in fragments while on picnics . The pictures, along with a note which discussed Dodgson's fondness for children, has lead to speculation that he was a paedophile . Details of the latest letter have come to light ahead of the auction in London on March 19. Bonhams is also selling a second note from the author, in which he thanks Miss Symonds for an invitation to tea, and adds that his teenage companion Isa Bowman is forbidden to drink tea or coffee, but will take cocoa. Also being auctioned are two photos by Dodgson, expected to fetch up to £800 each. The first shows a young girl believed to be Eleanor Howes, in a bathing costume at Eastbourne in 1883. The second is a portrait of three-year-old Ethel Hatch, taken in 1894.","Letter addressed to 'Mrs Symonds' from Lewis Carroll .

A mother-of-two died from cancer after she was treated by a surgeon being investigated over alleged botched operations . Michelle Flavelle was just 47 when she lost her fight against the illness. She was treated by surgeon Ian Paterson at Solihull Hospital after being diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005. But she fell ill again five years later, as the scandal over the surgeon’s 'cleavage-sparing' mastectomies began to break. Michelle Flavelle was just 47 when she lost her fight against breast cancer. She was treated by surgeon Ian Paterson at Solihull Hospital, who has since been suspended by the GMC . Paterson is accused of performing experimental 'cleavage-sparing' mastectomies, in which tissue is left behind for cosmetic reasons, without permission . Paterson is accused of performing experimental ‘cleavage-sparing’ mastectomies, in which tissue is left behind for cosmetic reasons, on 700 patients without patients' permission. It is alleged that this may raise the risk of them developing cancer by up to 50 per cent. Tests revealed that Ms Flavelle, from Castle Bromwich, Birmingham, had secondary cancer that had spread to her liver. Her best friends, Denise Philpotts and Debbie Jacques, last night told of their 'hatred' for Paterson, who has been suspended by the General Medical Council and is the subject of a police investigation. 'I hate him,', said Ms Jacques, 45. 'I feel angry - but Michelle never did. 'She was never recalled and we can never prove the operation is the reason the cancer came back,' added Ms Philpotts, 54. 'She accepted it. She would say: ""You’ve got your health and I’ve got my wealth and together we’ll get on with it"". She was so positive and strong.' Paterson was suspended by the GMC in late 2012 following claims he carried out the 'cleavage-sparing” procedure on patients, said by her friends to have included Michelle, without their consent. After surgery, tests revealed that Ms Flavelle had secondary cancer that had spread to her liver. It is alleged that cleavage-sparing mastectomies may raise the risk of developing cancer by up to 50 per cent . The surgery was not a recognised practice and left patients with a degree of breast tissue for cosmetic reasons. A damning report last month revealed more than 200 of Paterson’s patients underwent 'suboptimal' mastectomies. Lawyer Sir Ian Kennedy’s review also found their chances of suffering a cancer relapse within five years were more than double that of his patients who had full mastectomies. Ms Flavelle's friends added that she was initially happy with the treatment provided by Paterson. But they added that her friend, whose children are Jess, 17 and Ben, 21, 'started to ask questions' before her secondary cancer was diagnosed in April 2010. Although Ms Flavelle was told she would only have 12 months to live after her secondary cancer was diagnosed, she was determined to make the most of her time . Ms Philpotts said: 'She had undergone reconstruction surgery not long before, and she could barely stand up afterwards. She had a pain in her stomach, too. 'After that diagnosis her life changed. She took early retirement and made a bucket list of what she wanted to do. 'She wanted to fly in a helicopter and go on loads of holidays.' Although Ms Flavelle was told she would only have 12 months to live, she was determined to make the most of her time. She organised weekends away, theatre trips and meals out. Ms Jacques said: 'Nothing was about dying - she was about living. 'She would tell you off if you cried. If we watched a sad DVD she would put a fiver on the table and say the last person to cry would win the money. It was always her. 'One weekend we went to Skegness and played pass the parcel with her fake boob and wig as a prize. She could always take the mickey out of herself.' Ms Flavelle's friends say she exceeded all expectations and lived a 'happy and full life' for three years after her diagnosis . Ms Flavelle exceeded all expectations and lived a happy and full life for three years after her diagnosis. But her health deteriorated last summer and she died at the John Taylor Hospice in Erdington in August. Now her friends are organising a black-tie charity ball in her memory, to mark what would have been her 48th birthday. 'After she died we were lost,' said Ms Jacques. 'But we knew we wanted to do something for her. 'That’s when Denise came up with the idea of doing a ball. Ms Flavelle's friends are organising a black-tie charity ball in her memory, to mark what would have been her 48th birthday . 'We knew it had to be a big party, because if Michelle was here that’s definitely what she would have wanted. She loved a party. The event will raise money for the John Taylor Hospice, and Breast Friends Sutton and Tamworth, a cancer support group based at Good Hope Hospital. Both charities helped Michelle during her illness. 'I don’t think we could have done this without Michelle behind us,' said Denise. 'It will be her first birthday that she won’t be here,' said Debbie. 'She was a party girl. We wanted to do something in her memory to give something back.'","Michelle Flavelle was treated by surgeon Ian Paterson at Solihull Hospital .

Reader's Digest has been bought by Mike Luckwell, who says he wants to target the over-50s market and take 'crumbs from Saga's table' A venture capitalist who made millions from the TV company behind Bob the Builder has snapped up struggling Reader’s Digest UK for a nominal sum. Mike Luckwell acquired the magazine last week for a token price from Jon Moulton’s Better Capital, which rescued it from administration in 2010. Better Capital has decided to exit the business after investing £23 million, including the £13 million purchase price. Mr Luckwell believes the title can help take 'crumbs from Saga’s table' by concentrating on the over-50s market and exploiting financial services opportunities. He has pledged to continue monthly publication and said he hoped to strengthen the business but was unable to give any immediate assurances on jobs following the deal late on Friday. Reader’s Digest is sent to nearly half a million subscribers and regularly operates lucrative prize draws. It also markets a series of products to its customer base. But it collapsed into a company voluntary arrangement in January last year after a severe decline in its book and CD selling business. It saw 95 out of 125 staff lose their jobs but allowed the magazine to continue trading while exiting unprofitable activities. Better Capital said in a brief update in a trading statement that it had sold Reader’s Digest to a 'strategic trade buyer for a nominal sum'. Mr Moulton told the Daily Telegraph that 'from the point of view of the fund, the business didn’t justify the time and effort for us'. Mr Luckwell is thought to have amassed a personal fortune of more than £100 million after a series of profitable investments in the likes of Carlton Communications and advertiser WPP. Mr Luckwell made millions as the owner of the TV company which produced Bob the Builder . In 2005 he made £33 million from his stake in children’s TV company HIT Entertainment, which owned the copyright to programmes such as Bob the Builder, which were sold around the world. He said: 'The publication of Reader’s Digest will continue without interruption and its high editorial standards will be maintained.' Mr Luckwell hopes to use the business to bolster the database of his existing interests selling products, mainly DVDs, to the over-50s, taking it to a total 2.7 million names. He wants to exploit the 'huge, largely untapped' opportunities for this age group, emulating the business model of Saga. Mr Luckwell said: 'Saga cleverly focused on holidays and the financial sector for the over 50s but now has a finger in many pies. 'Today it has annual sales running into hundreds of millions and that merits a bit of competition since it’s tough to name another big, analogous, success story.'","Mike Luckwell has snapped up struggling magazine .

Long-term stress can make people less likely to take advantage of opportunities by taking risks, a new study has found. Those with high levels of the stress hormone cortisol over long periods can make people less risk-averse and more pessimistic, according to Cambridge University researchers. The new study suggests that City traders are less likely to hold their nerve and make good decisions during times of financial crisis, worsening economic decline. City traders (depicted here by Leonardo DiCaprio in The Wolf of Wall Street) are less likely to hold their nerve and make good decisions during times of financial crisis, worsening economic decline . The research, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, tracked the cortisol levels of a group of volunteers placed in conditions similar to a financial trading business. The study was designed to mimic earlier research that showed a 68 per cent hike in cortisol levels among real City of London traders as market volatility increased over a period of two weeks. The researchers found those with higher stress levels were less likely to take risks. Dr John Coates, a member of the Cambridge University research team and a former Wall Street derivatives trader, said: ‘Any trader knows that their body is taken on roller-coaster ride by the markets. What we haven’t known until this study was that these physiological changes - the sub-clinical levels of stress of which we are only dimly aware - are actually altering our ability to take risk. ‘It is frightening to realise that no one in the financial world - not the traders, not the risk managers, not the central bankers - knows that these subterranean shifts in risk appetite are taking place.’ High levels of the stress hormone cortisol can make city traders less risk-averse and more pessimistic . Cortisol, secreted by the adrenal glands, fuels the ‘fight or flight’ response that evolved to aid survival in the face of physical threats, such as predators. Over an eight day period, the volunteers - 20 men and 16 women aged 20 to 36 - were given an artificial form of cortisol that raised their levels of the stress hormone by 69 per cent, mimicking the increase seen previously in traders. Initial spikes of cortisol had little effect on behaviour, but over time the willingness of participants to take risks fell dramatically. Dr Coates added: ‘Traders, risk managers, and central banks cannot hope to manage risk if they do not understand that the drivers of risk taking lurk deep in our bodies.’ ‘Risk managers who fail to understand this will have as little success as fire fighters spraying water at the tips of flames.’","High levels of the stress hormone cortisol over long periods can make people less risk-averse and more pessimistic .

And now one university has spent £20,000 creating a pub laboratory in a bid to unlock the secrets of people's drinking habits and why they overindulge. Hidden cameras and microphones will monitor students’ behaviour as they guzzle a free drink - or five. Cheers! London South Bank University has spent £20,000 creating a pub laboratory (pictured) in a bid to unlock the secrets of people's drinking habits and why they overindulge . People who are drunk and anxious are most likely to be emotionally connected to Facebook, according to a 2013 study. Russell Clayton, from the University of Missouri surveyed more than 225 students about their perceived levels of loneliness, anxiousness, alcohol use and marijuana use. He found that students who reported higher levels of anxiousness and alcohol use were more emotionally connected to Facebook and to the social connections it facilitates. Mr Clayton also discovered that students who had higher levels of anxiety and loneliness were more likely to use Facebook as a platform to connect with others. He added that because alcohol use is generally viewed as normative, or socially acceptable, among college students, increased alcohol use may cause an increase in emotional connectedness to Facebook. There is a serious side to the study at London South Bank University as the lavish experiment is designed to study consumer behaviour and could ultimately help experts work out a way to encourage people to drink more responsibly. The 'pub lab' will initially look into how much people choose to drink and how people take more risks as they consume more alcohol. Volunteers will be given free drinks but there is a catch – some the beer and glasses of wine on offer will be alcohol free but smell of ethanol. The pub lab looks like the real deal and even has a fruit machine. It is designed to be a realistic setting to investigate the ‘factors that motivate people’s drinking’ as real pubs in the outside world have too many distractions - making findings often inaccurate. Free drinks with a side order of science: Hidden cameras and microphones will monitor students¿ behaviour in the pub lab (pictured) as they guzzle in a free drink - or five. They will be breathalyzed too . The university said the experiment is ‘relatively low cost’ and is ‘extraordinarily useful’. Dr Tony Moss, head of psychology at the university told The Evening Standard: ‘A lot of the early work we have been doing isn’t so much interested in the effects of alcohol once people are intoxicated, but trying to understand factors that motivate people to drink in certain ways – particularly how they initiate a night out when they are drinking.’ ‘Of course, there are studies we do which involve administering alcohol to people, so that we can see what happens later on,’ he added. Karis Humphreys, a psychology masters student at the university said that offering free drinks is a successful technique to get other students to help out with a scientific study. ‘We all drink a lot, so you can see the findings in your day-to-day life,’ she said.

A new explosion in traffic fines may have started today after a council revealed it is the first to use automated CCTV to catch drivers making banned turns or illegally using yellow-box junctions. Redbridge Council in east London insists its new system will tackle 'serious traffic contraventions' but critics say it is another way of 'harvesting' money from motorists. Currently drivers breaking the rules must be seen on camera by an operator, either live or after watching back video, before issuing the £130 fine. Now cameras at four junctions will automatically detect if there has been a banned turn or a yellow-box encroachment, and then use number plate recognition to identify the vehicle. Fine regime: A London borough has become the first in Britain to use automatic CCTV to catch drivers who stop in box junctions like this one . Eye in the sky: Drivers who carry out illegal turns at junctions will also be snared automatically in a move that could kick-start an avalanche of new fines, experts fear . Its makers boast that the system will 'capture more offences' and 'deliver a higher return on investment'. Redbridge . council's environment, transportation and crime committee head, Shoaib . Patel, said: 'The system was installed to counter the high number of . drivers that were ignoring the traffic restrictions that were in place, . causing severe safety hazards to pedestrians and other drivers. 'The . system is working well and we have captured a number of vehicles . committing serious traffic contraventions, which is promising.' The company behind the system, Videalert, uses advanced camera technology known as ANPR (automatic number plate recognition) to capture drivers breaching traffic laws. Videalert says its technology can read numberplates that were blind to old ANPR systems - for example, if they were dirty or had been sprayed with non-reflective paint. The system has been installed using a ‘capital expenditure neutral’ model, which sees all costs recovered through the issuing of penalty charge notices (PCNs). It automates the detection and capture of  moving traffic offences, and comes up with 'validation processing' of the evidence data. This is then automatically posted to the back office system that issues the PCNs. The firm claims a study showed its . scheme detected 2 per cent more vehicles over a 90-minute period, . compared to a normal ANPR system without its new camera technology. It promises that the system ‘will . deliver a higher return on investment and compliance whilst increasing . road safety wherever it is deployed'. Motoring groups have worries about the new system, especially because councils may decide to fit the systems on junctions likely to produce more fines. AA . president Edmund King said: 'We are concerned that this automated . system is more about harvesting motorists for money and profit than . deterring bad driver behaviour. 'There . needs to be the safeguard that, if this system starts fining drivers on . an industrial scale, an analysis of the problem junctions takes place. The ticket haul may be partly down to the road layout. 'There . is also the added concern that, if signing is inadequate, local drivers . may learn to be wary but outsiders may be caught time after time for . mistakes, minor infringements or circumstances outside their control, . such as making way for emergency vehicles.' RAC . head of external affairs Pete Williams said: 'It is very worrying to . hear mention of a phrase like 'will deliver a higher return on . investment' in association with a new type of moving traffic offence . enforcement camera as it automatically makes you think the council is . investing to make money rather than to change driver behaviour. 'Common . sense needs to be applied with a new system like this to avoid creating . a situation similar to Clapham's 'money box junction' (in south London) where a camera has been positioned in a place where there are clearly . issues with the design and layout of the road which leads to motorists . repeatedly being caught out. Expansion: Britain's camera network already uses similar technology for speed offences but now it has been extended to several junctions . 'If . drivers are blatantly ignoring signage, then something needs to be . done, but fairness should be key in the use of cameras like these. 'It . is encouraging, however, to hear that footage will be reviewed before . penalty charge notices are issued as this will hopefully prevent some . accidental driver errors being unfairly penalised.' In use at four locations, the system has been designed by the Videalert company and can also catch drivers ignoring restricted access signs. According to the company, its system combines video analytics and ANPR (automatic number plate recognition) detection to 'capture more offences than can be achieved by traditional legacy solutions and will deliver a higher return on investment and compliance whilst increasing road safety wherever it is deployed'.","Redbridge in east London has installed new cameras at four junctions .

Tommy Roye the husband of a BBC executive Victoria has been jailed for masterminding a plot to extort money from the chief executive of a media firm . The husband of a BBC executive has been jailed after he masterminded a blackmail plot against the head of a media firm. Tommy Roye, 39, demanded cash over a two month period, from innocent businessman Craig Farley-Jones, 37. Manchester Crown Court heard that Roye recruited two enforcers to have his victim’s car torched on his driveway because his business partner owed £30,000 to him and his associates. During a confrontation Roye told father of one Mr Farley-Jones: 'I will f**k you up now, you don’t know who you are messing with. I’ll f**k you up and put you in that skip over there'. In the run up to arson attack, the victims received menacing text messages reading: 'If you don’t reply within an hour we will send someone' Police called in by Mr Farley-Jones arrested Roye a day after the arson attack on his people carrier vehicle and found two ornamental Samurai swords and a machete at his home in Urmston, Greater Manchester. Father of one Roye has now been jailed for six years after being convicted of blackmail, conspiracy to commit arson and threatening to destroy property. Three accomplices were also jailed for their part in the plot. Roye’s wife Victoria, 41, a BBC Talent Executive for Entertainment North was not in court for the hearing.

During her career she helped the staffing of TV productions like Junior Doctors, Dragons’ Den and A Question of Sport. An out-of-office email to her BBC account said she was on leave. After the case Det Sgt Patrick Goodrich branded Roye and his three accomplices as an 'organised crime group' and said: 'This case involved a totally innocent and legitimate businessman who unwittingly became embroiled in a blackmail plot driven by a gang of violent criminals. Pose: Mrs Roye in her days as a model . 'All he wanted to do was help out a colleague who had got himself into debt, and for his troubles endured two months of hell at the hands of an extremely intimidating and aggressive band of criminals. 'That they went so far as to torch this man’s car as it was parked on his driveway, bearing in mind this man has a wife and daughter, shows how dangerous these men were. 'You can only imagine the anguish this man suffered for those two months, being bombarded with violent threats simply for trying to help a colleague. 'I have no doubt whatsoever that the streets are a lot safer now that these four men are behind bars. I would also like to praise the tenacity of the victim himself who hung in there despite the hell he was subjected to and helped us to convict these men. 'Organised crime groups like these cause real misery and hardship for law-abiding and innocent members of our communities. However, we have been targeting organised crime groups at all levels for the last two years and have achieved some fantastic results. 'We are tackling these groups with every tactic open to us, taking away their liberty, their homes, their cars and their cash.' Earlier the Manchester court heard Mr Farley-Jones - chief executive of Jungle Media and who works with former Celebrity Big Brother winner Mark Bez Berry - ran a Cheshire nightclub with a childhood friend known as Marvin. It was said that trouble began in August 2012 after he fell into debt and called Mr Farley-Jones for help. Gary Woodhall prosecuting said Mr Farley Jones arrived at the pub to find Roye holding what appeared to be a gun and telling: 'You are a piece of sh*t, you are a liar. Not even your business partner will help you out’. Mr Farley-Jones offered to pay £5,000 himself to buy time for his friend but was assured by Marvin he would not have to pay a penny. The court was told that he later received a text from Roye saying: 'Why would you get out of bed in the middle of the night and agree to pay and then not pay’. The following October Mr Farley-Jones was in another pub when Roye and one of his enforcers who had been hiding in a garden, converged on the victim 'like hyenas'. Marcel Lauder, 44, (left) of Derby and Jamie Keegan, 31, of Sale, (right) pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit arson and blackmail at an earlier hearing. Lauder got 28 months and Keegan 24 months . Mr Woodall said: 'They surrounded Craig Farley-Jones. Tommy Roye was forceful and aggressive and demanded to know where the money was. Tommy Roye said he could deal with the problems there and then. 'Roye demanded the key to Craig Farley-Jones’ car and fearing he would be attacked, he handed over the key to his Audi car. Roye told him not to ring the police or ""the car would be burned out - or the car driven through the house"". Mr Farley-Jones again agreed to pay the money and the car was returned. But Roye then repeatedly contacted Mr Farley-Jones sending text messages referring to the victim’s house. When the victim replied saying that he would go to police, Roye’s menacing response was: 'Police? Call the fire service as well’. While Mr Farley-Jones was in a police station giving a statement. his Rodge Ram people carrier car was set on fire on his driveway. He later said the blackmail plot was 'soul destroying' and had a 'massive effect' on his life and he was forced to move out of the area as a result. His wife’s mental health deteriorated and he now felt isolated from family and friends. Fear had taken over his life, he said, and he now always looks over his shoulder when out and is afraid of answering the front door. Ashley Gusihard was jailed for seven years after being convicted of blackmail and unrelated charges of possessing drugs with intent to supply . Roye had 25 previous convictions including a wounding offence in 1992 when he slashed a man on the chin leaving a three inch wound. He also has convictions for drug possession and in 1995 was jailed for ten years for armed robbery. In mitigation his defence counsel Miss Bernadette Baxter said: 'He understands the impact it is going to have on his family and has ensured his wife and children underwent counselling for his inevitable prison sentence. 'He runs a successful business with his partner who is leading that whilst he is in custody. It was a short lived period of events - there was no direct violence.' Passing sentence Judge Adrian Smith told Roye: 'You were the instigator and organiser in the campaign of threats. 'Blackmail is designed to instil fear into the life of another human being. It’s a cruel offence and can seriously affect a life and those around him. 'You made chilling threats to burn his house down. This offence has impacted upon his life and family’s life in a serious way and is still ongoing.'

A row has erupted after a swingers club opened directly opposite a Christian TV station and just yards away from a primary school. Vivente Club in Sunderland promises late-night sex swapping parties five nights a week and organisers offer to open 'by appointment only' between 10am-4pm. But the venue has been condemned by a local councillor, who says it is a 'blatant attempt to cash in on people's sexual interests'. Controversial: The club, which is offering 'late night sex-swapping parties' opened opposite the God V headquarters (on the left) in Sunderland . The swinging club will cost couples £25 for a . 12-month membership, allowing them access to six 'playrooms', three . lounge floors and a couples-only area. It also has an 11-room bed and . breakfast. It is located yards from Hudson Road Primary School and directly opposite Christian media outlet - God TV. Sunderland Councillor Barbara McClennan, said: 'The particularly sordid nature of this club makes me - backed by local residents - even more determined to block this blatant attempt to cash in on people’s sexual interests. Opposition: Councillor Barbara McClennan says the 'sordid' nature of the venue makes her determined to block it . 'If someone wants to live a ""swinging lifestyle"" let them do it in their own homes - not on the doorsteps of Hendon residents, around the corner from a local school and near places of worship.' Swinging, where couples swap sexual partners, is not illegal, but Sunderland City Council said the club needs planning permission to operate - which Vivente’s owners do not have. Sunderland City Council confirmed the authority had not given the club the go-ahead. A spokesperson from Sunderland City Council said: 'The use of the premises as a swingers’ club is unauthorised and needs planning permission. 'All planning applications are considered on their individual merits and have . to undergo a statutory period of public consultation. 'This gives local residents, . businesses and community partners the opportunity to make their views . known on proposed developments within their area.' Vivente’s . organisers, who claim to have 20 years’ experience of the swinging . scene, boast on their website: 'We want to break the stereotypical . ideals people have about swinging and hopefully bring something fresh . and vibrant to our venue.' Anger: It was opened just yards away from Hudson Road Primary School . Vivente said: 'We are a private members club who offer a safe discreet environment for professional people to meet like minded people. We do not promise sex swap parties, that has been hyped up. 'What about transvestites and cross dressers, do they not have a human right to frequent establishments like this where they are free to express themselves. Clients such as these and single girls who have enquired do not feel safe in town centres. 'The issue of binge drinkers and louts in the city centre at weekends should be far more of a concern. 'As for the God Channel, Barbara McClennan is using this as a pitiful excuse. The bible states no man should lie with another man yet churches allow gay marriage. 'Also if Ms McClennan is so concerned for her patch why are our neighbours the lifeline centre, where heroin addicts are given methodone and numerous amount of used needles are found right near the school in back lanes etc. 'Camrex house and the Norfolk Hotel are dens for drug addicts and alcoholics who are frequently seen drunk at 8am in the morning. There is nothing of danger or offensive about professional couples entering a building and the door closed behind them. 'Also she mentions about keeping it in their home, how is that possible? people have families and neighbours to think about. 'Swinging couples are spicing up a relationship and that is far better than affairs and divorce affecting the family unit and devastating children. This lifestyle keeps families together.

A pair of twins who live parallel lives, even working the same job, have taken their double life to extremes - by giving birth on the same day. Heather Richardson and Sarah Fidler, 35, were already as close as can be after growing up together, choosing the same university and taking identical jobs as science technicians at a secondary school in North Shields, Tyneside. But, despite both women having discovered that they were pregnant on the same day, the uncanny sequences of events seemed to end when they were given different due dates. Coincidence: Sarah Fidler, left with baby Austin, is pictured alongside her sister Heather Richardson, with her daughter Emelie, right . The twins - who say they 'feel the same pains' as each other - were taken to separate hospitals as the day drew nearer, with Heather set for a caesarian while Sarah opted for a natural birth. However, just as Heather's daughter Emelie Frances was removed via C-section at Newcastle's Victoria Infrimary early on Thursday morning last week, her sister's contractions began at the Wansbeck General Hospital in Ashington. By the afternoon, she too had given birth to a child - a baby boy named Austin. After the births, both were moved to North Tyneside General Hospital for post-natal care, and are in cubicles next to to one another. Parallel families: Sarah, left, smiles with her son Austin and husband Sean, next to Heather, baby Emelie and her husband Daniel, right . Peas in a pod: The sisters say they have always been close - and can even feel one another's pain . Sarah, from Linton, near Ashington in Northumberland, said: 'I honestly didn’t think that I would go into labour at the same time. My contractions started at 1.20am, the exact moment Emelie was born by C-section, and I had Austin at 2.55pm that day.' Heather, who lives with her husband Daniel in North Tyneside, said: 'We do feel the same pains and if the other one is upset, we can feel it. 'We are really close and have been ever since we were little but I can’t believe this. The staff at all the hospitals involved said they have never heard anything like it.' The siblings  both work at St Thomas More RC Academy at North Shields as science technicians and both studied at Sunderland University. Same age: Both Austin, left, and Emelie, right, were born on Thursday February 13 . After being a double-pack of pregnancy tests in June, Heather discovered she was pregnant, and rushed to tell Sarah and her husband Sean. And, using the second kit from the back, Sarah discovered the same day that she was pregnant. Sean said: 'To me it feels as though we’ve had twins ourselves. Not only have I got a son but I’ve got a daughter as well.' The sisters’ dad John Gibbs, of Morpeth, Northumberland, was also delighted to hear he had become a grandfather twice in one day and that their mum Frances, who died four years ago, will be remembered by both of their middle names. Daniel, who has known his brother-in-law since their school days, said: 'We would really like to thank the NHS staff at all three hospitals for their care. They’ve been fantastic.' Midwife Annwa Atkinson, said: 'This is the first time I’ve ever known this to happen.

A transgender former MP from Italy has been arrested at the Winter Olympics in Sochi for carrying a banner that said ‘It’s OK to be gay.’ Vladimir Luxuria, the first transgender MP of any European country, was taken into police custody shortly after posing for a photograph at the Olympic site holding a rainbow umbrella and fan. ‘In your face Putin!’ she wrote on Twitter as she posted the picture. Scroll down to video . Detained: Vladimir Luxuria, Europe's first transgender MP, was brandishing rainbow flags when police swooped . The actor and gay activist was referring to a controversial law by Russian President Vladimir Putin’s which criminalises the promotion of homosexuality. Miss Luxuria, who lives exclusively as a woman but has not undergone a sex change, was subjected to a ‘brutal and aggressive' arrest by Russian officers on Sunday as she queued to buy tickets for a hockey match. Imma Battaglia, head of Italy's Gay Project action group, said: 'I have just received a phone call from Vladimir Luxuria. She has been arrested in Sochi as she attended the Games with a flag written in Russian ""It’s OK to be gay"". 'The arrest by the agents was brutal and aggressive. No one spoke English. She now finds herself alone in a room with neon lights shone into her face presumably in a state of arrest.’ Friends claim the arrest was aggressive. The Italian government was forced to negotiate her out of jail . After a swift diplomatic intervention by the Italian government the popular TV personality was freed overnight and vowed to return to the Olympic site. A spokesman for Italy’s Foreign Ministry said: ‘Our team worked for her freedom from the very first moment. She was released within 24 hours.’ She was not injured or threatened by the Russian police, the Ministry said. The popular TV personality, who was an MP in the 2006 Prodi government, was in Russia to interview members of the Italian Olympic team. Miss Luxuria had earlier declared her intention to protest against the law by wearing drag to an Olympic hockey match to be attended by her namesake Vladimir Putin. She told Italian news agency ANSA she wanted to attend the Russia match on Tuesday night at the Bolshoi Ice Dom ‘as I’m dressed now: long skirt, earrings, bracelets and fan in all the colours of the rainbow. It is the latest in years of protests by the popular Italian MP-turned-TV star, here seen at the Vatican in 2008 . ‘I am a living rainbow, these are the colours of my team,’ she declared. ‘My protest is against an absurd law that prohibits the promotion of homosexuality wherever there are children as a pretext for not talking about homosexuality. ‘And I find unacceptable the equating of homosexuality with paedophilia, which is not a sexual orientation but an aberration.' Senator Sergio Lo Giudice, said: ‘The arrest of the ex-parliamentarian demonstrates all the hypocrisy of Putin and his regime.’ Nichi Vendola, leader of Italy's left wing SEL party, tweeted: 'Rebel freely without fear of the moral police.

Each year, one in every 1,000 Britons develops deep vein thrombosis - a blood clot in a large vein. This can cause permanent vein damage, raising the risk of further clots. Andrea Fernandez, 25, a communications assistant from Brixton, South London, was the first person in the world to undergo a new treatment to reduce the symptoms and prevent a second DVT, as she tells SOPHIE GOODCHILD. Lying on the sofa one night, I suddenly felt intense pain in my groin. I thought it was due to the position I'd been in, so didn't think anything more of it, and went to bed. When I woke up the next morning, the pain was worse and had spread down my right leg. I was in agony and my leg was red and swollen to twice its size. I could barely walk and couldn't bend my knee. I managed to take myself to hospital, where doctors found I had a deep vein thrombosis in my groin. Part of the clot had broken off and gone to my lung. It turned out I have a genetic condition which means I don't make enough of the protein that prevents clots forming. My mum and sister have since been tested, and they also have the condition.I spent a week in hospital. I was given painkillers and the blood-thinning drug acenocoumarol. The doctors prescribed compression stockings for the swelling. This was three years ago, and since then the DVT has really impacted my life. My leg would get swollen and red in hot weather, or if I'd been standing for a while. I had to monitor my diet, as high levels of vitamin K - found in leafy green vegetables and some cereals - can stop the medication working properly. I had to avoid alcohol for the same reason. I needed monthly tests to check my blood for clots and doctors adjusted my dose of medication often. Then aged 22, I found the compression stockings a hassle. They were hard to put on and could get uncomfortable. I had to wear them all the time - and they're not the sort of thing you want to wear with a short skirt. Last year, I found a pea-sized lump in my right groin. It wasn't painful and I could only feel it when standing, so I didn't panic. After a month, I saw my GP for my regular check. He referred me to St  George's Hospital to make sure the lump wasn't a hernia. A scan revealed it was a varicose vein. Because the clot left my veins badly damaged and scarred, blood was not moving properly through my leg, causing a vein to bulge out under the skin, as too much blood was collecting in it. And there was a risk of another clot. I first saw Mr Stephen Black, a consultant vascular surgeon at the hospital, last November. He told me about a new treatment using a tiny mesh tube that holds damaged veins open to allow blood to flow normally. This would reduce the risk of clots and mean no more swelling, pain or compression stockings. The operation would take only an hour and a half. Andrea had a pioneering new procedure using a tiny mesh tube that holds damaged veins open . I had the operation in January this year. I stayed in hospital for a night, and the next day I could almost walk normally. One . month on, I don't have any pain. I still have to take medication, . because of my genetic condition, but I'm now on a new blood-thinning . drug called rivaroxaban. Before, I needed to take different doses on . different days, but this was one daily pill. In a couple of months, I won't need compression stockings and my leg should be back to the size it was before the DVT. Stephen Black is a consultant vascular surgeon at St George's Hospital in Tooting, South London.DVT is a blood clot that develops in a large vein, usually in the leg. Normally, blood flows quickly through veins, but factors such as being inactive can slow down this flow and trigger clots. Patients who have recently undergone surgery are particularly at risk. About a third develop a clot extending from lower in the leg to the upper thigh or groin. Andrea's clot extended from her knee into her pelvis. The higher the clot, the greater the risk of a bit breaking off and travelling to the lungs. Called a pulmonary embolism, this may be fatal in around one in ten people. Untreated, it can cause cardiac arrest, as the lung clot can cut off blood flow to the heart. Another issue is the clot remaining in . a vein for too long. The blockage can damage the vein, creating scar . tissue, which restricts blood flow. Blood-thinning . drugs such as warfarin are common treatments. But these don't dissolve . the clot, they thin the blood and prevent further clots. Doctors . can try to break up the clot with special clot-busting drugs. However, . these increase the risk of internal bleeding, so are only used in . chronic cases. Doctors have also tried using stents in patients with DVT. Stents are tiny cylindrical mesh tubes that act like scaffolding, widening a damaged blood vessel so blood can flow normally. while the stent doesn't remove the clot, it reduces the risk of a new DVT. But the success of stents in veins has been variable, as previously they've only been designed for arteries. Veins are larger and more powerful, so the stent becomes blocked or crushed. However, a stronger stent has been developed in the U.S. for veins. I set up a programme at St  George's, helped by Professor Peter Neglen, a stent pioneer who is retired but is chair of the European Venous Forum. The treatment is a team effort. One month on, she has no pain . Andrea was the first patient to be treated with this new stent. Called the Veniti Vici Venous Stent, it has the same strength end-to-end, so is crush-resistant. It's made from nitinol - nickel and titanium - which is more flexible than other metals. Kept cold outside of the body, it can be compressed to a very small size, meaning we can make a smaller incision to place it. Once inserted, it expands and reaches full strength at body temperature. It is also slightly larger than a normal stent. Stent treatment is not suitable for patients with clots lower down the leg, as the veins are too small. This new stent is remarkably . effective. Long-term studies in the U.S. suggest nearly three-quarters . of patients will be pain-free, and around half will no longer have . swelling. The stents work in 90 per cent of cases. Although . Andrea had recovered from her DVT, the veins in the pelvis had chronic . scarring. This restricted blood flow and she was at risk of further . clots. Under general anaesthetic, we make a small incision, either inside the lower thigh, just above or behind the knee. A thin tube (catheter) is inserted and this releases the stent into the vein. We use X-ray and a special device called intravascular ultrasound, a miniature machine that goes inside the vein, to see where the damage is and make sure we put in the right number of stents. Patients need between one and four, depending on the extent of damage. Andrea needed three. After the operation, we put a stocking on her leg and fitted special boots connected to a pump via flexible tubes to keep blood flowing normally, until she was up and walking the next day. Some patients may need more than one procedure if the stent shows signs of blocking. If there hasn't been a problem within six weeks, it's usually OK long-term. We keep patients on blood-thinning drugs for the first six months, just to be sure. If there isn't a blockage, there's no reason the stents won't last a lifetime. Risks include bleeding in less than 1 per cent of cases (it's higher in the over-75s) and pulmonary embolism, also in less than 1 per cent of cases. Each stent costs £1,200. The total cost is £4,500 if done privately, or around £3,000 to the NHS.","Andrea Fernandez, 25, Brixton, is first person to undergo DVT treatment .

A giant isopod, a crustacean known as the 'scavenger of the deep,' has been found dead in its tank by keepers at an aquarium in Japan, after the creature refused to eat for more than five years. The animal, which looks like an oversized pill-bug and is related to the wood louse, was declared dead at a feeding event at the Toba Aquarium in Japan on Friday February 14. The giant male isopod, called No. 1 to distinguish it from the nine other giant isopods kept at the Japanese aquarium, has not eaten since January 2009, when it ate a whole horse mackerel. Scroll down for video . Creature dies: Giant isopod dies after five-year hunger strike . No. 1's keeper Takeya Moritaki has been dumbfounded by the crustacean's hunger strike, claiming the deep-sea creature would at times pretend to eat by moving its mouth and front legs around the food to appease aquarium staff, however it never actually swallowed. Mr Moritaki, was preparing the mackerel for No. 1's six-monthly feed, however the giant isopod sat motionless as the bait was lowered in to the tank, according to Rocket News. Realising something was wrong, No. 1 was lifted out of the tank and declared dead. At that point, the creature had starved itself for five years and 43 days. It has been widely reported as the longest time any animal under observation has gone without food. The death of the giant isopod, has been confirmed by the aquarium and a dissection was performed, however no cause of death was found. The creature - which has been compared to a giant woodlouse - will be frozen for preservation. Research is underway on the remains of No.1 to find out why it refused to eat. Giant isopod No. 1 was taken to Toba Aquarium from the Gulf of Mexico in September 2007, measuring 29 cm and weighing 1 kg. A giant isopod is a crustacean related to prawns and crabs, which are thought to be abundant in cold, deep waters of the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans.","Giant isopod found dead at feeding event at Toba Aquarium in Japan .

The items were dragged out of sewers by Scottish Water workers throughout last year. Among these were a pair of jeans, pants, mobile phones, toy soldiers, a deckchair, false teeth and a golf club. On one occasion, a credit card stolen from a Scottish Water employee turned up on the screens of the sewage works. The company said around 80 per cent of the blockages were caused by people putting the wrong things down sinks and toilets. Stuck: A pair of jeans were found blocking a pipe in Strathblane . Strange: An action man figure, a watch, a ring and a mobile phone were all said to have caused problems in drainage systems last year .

Chris Wallace, director of communications at Scottish Water, said: 'The waste water drain which runs from your house to the public sewer is usually only about four inches wide, which is less than the diameter of a DVD. 'This drain is designed to take only the used water from sinks, showers and baths and pee, poo and toilet paper from the toilet.

An Ethiopian Airlines co-pilot hijacked a plane bound for Rome and flew it to Switzerland, where he wanted to seek asylum, officials said today. The Boeing 767-300 aircraft with 202 passengers and crew on board had taken off from the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, and landed in Geneva at about 6am local time with just 20 minutes of fuel remaining. The plane circled around Geneva until the co-pilot heard a direct response about his requests for asylum, it has been reported. Scroll down for video . Arrest: An Ethiopian Airlines flight forced to land in Geneva, where the hijacker has been taken into police custody . Police evacuate passengers from the Ethiopian Airlines flight . Police search passengers after helping them disembark from the hijacked Ethiopian Airlines flight . No alarm: The passengers were apparently unaware that the plane had been hijacked . Geneva airport chief executive Robert . Deillon told reporters that the co-pilot, an Ethiopian man born in 1983, . took control of the plane when the pilot left the cockpit. ‘The pilot went to the toilet and he (the co-pilot) locked himself in the cockpit,’ Mr Deillon said. The man ""wanted asylum in Switzerland"",' he said. ‘That's the motivation of the hijacking.’ The co-pilot himself alerted authorities to the plane's hijacking . Precaution: Geneva Airport was temporarily closed when the hijacked plane landed . Unusual approach: A graphic from a tracking app showing how the plane circled over Geneva . The hijacking code transmitted by the aircraft was picked up by aviation websites, including Airline Reporter, which tweeted the worrying news . An Ethiopian man smuggled a pistol onto a plane and hijacked a Lufthansa flight going from Frankfurt to Addis Ababa in 1993. He demanded it be flown to the U.S. because he was denied a visa. In June and April 1994, Ethiopian Airlines suffered two hijackings at the hands of passengers who demanded to be flown to Europe, according to the Aviation Safety Network, which tracks aviation hijackings and other incidents. In 1995, an Ethiopian man trying to avoid being sent back home used a knife from a food tray to commandeer an Olympic Airlines jet just before it landed in Athens, Greece. Police overpowered the hijacker with no injuries to any of the 114 people on board, according to AP reports. Also that year, five armed men seized an Ethiopian Airlines jetliner and demanded the plane be flown to Greece and then Sweden. It was instead diverted to Al Obeid, about 300 miles (480 kilometers) west of Khartoum, Sudan. In 1996 a flight from Ethiopia to Ivory Coast via Kenya was seized by hijackers who then demanded to be flown to Australia. That flight ran out fuel and crashed off the island nation of Comoros, killing 125 people, according to the Aviation Safety Network. In 2001, five military pilot trainees wrested control of a plane during a flight from Bahr Dar, in northwestern Ethiopia, to the capital Addis Ababa and demanded to be flown to Saudi Arabia. The plane didn't have enough fuel so it landed in neighboring Sudan, according to AP reports. In 2002 two passengers armed with small knives and an explosive device attempted to hijack a domestic flight but were shot and killed by in-flight security, the Aviation Safety Network reported. The . hijacking began over Italy, Switzerland's southern neighbour, and two . Italian fighter jets were scrambled to accompany the plane, Mr Deillon . said. The co-pilot himself . alerted authorities to the plane's hijacking, officials added - though . passengers on the plane were unaware it had been hijacked. After landing . in Geneva, the co-pilot exited the cockpit using a rope and turned . himself in to authorities. Police escorted passengers one by one, with their hands above their heads, from the taxied plane to waiting vehicles. Geneva . prosecutor Olivier Jornot said Swiss federal authorities were . investigating the hijacking and would press charges which could carry a . prison sentence of up to 20 years. Geneva airport was initially closed to other flights, but operations resumed around two hours after the hijacked plane landed. ‘We hope everything will return to normal in the afternoon,’ Mr Deillon added. The flight apparently began emitting a 'hijacking code' as it flew over Sudan and this was picked up by aviation site Airlinereporter.com. It tweeted in the early hours of Monday morning: 'Ethiopian Airlines’ Flight 702 Squawks “HiJacking” for Reasons Unknown.' It reported that this beacon, known as a '7500', cannot come from a glitch. The website said that the co-pilot kept the plane in the air over Switzerland and France until his asylum request was mentioned. Ethiopian Airlines is owned by Ethiopia's government, which has faced persistent criticism over its rights record and alleged intolerance for political dissent. Human Rights Watch says Ethiopia's human rights record 'has sharply deteriorated' over the years. The rights group says authorities severely restrict basic rights of freedom of expression, association, and assembly. The government has been accused of targeting journalists, opposition members, as well as the country's minority Muslim community.","Flight ET702 made an unscheduled landing in Geneva on Monday morning .

A fossilised mammoth tusk found on a US building site has been retrieved from a 30ft pit and is on its way to a museum. Cheers rang out as scientists and building crews used a crane to retrieve the tusk from the pit in Seattle, Washington state, to a waiting lorry. It measured 8ft 6in, had to be covered in 500lb of plaster for protection, and paleontologist Christian Sidor says it is between 22,000 and 60,000 years old. Whopper: The tusk was 8ft 6in long and workers first thought it was a pipe or a root . Important find: The fossil has been donated to the Burke Museum and will be one of the most complete in their entire collection - which is mainly made up of fragments . Preserved: The tusk had to be packed in around 500lb of plaster when it was found in order to protect it . The tusk is water-logged, and scientists say properly restoring and preserving it could take at least a year. Construction workers found the tusk Tuesday, thinking at first that it might be a pipe or a root. The company building a 118-unit apartment complex at the site has nearly stopped construction to accommodate the scientists. No more fossils were found during the overnight dig, the museum said Friday. 'Generally tusks like these are the last thing left' after animals and time remove the bones and the rest of the creature, Sidor said. Stalled: Work on the site stopped while the tusk was removed, but a spokesman for the construction company said the short term loos was worth it for the long term gain . Delicate: The tusk was waterlogged when it was found, and properly preserving it may take a year . Ancient: A paleontologist said the tusk could be between 22,000 and 60,000 years old . The tusk was donated to the Burke Museum at the request of the landowner. The costs of the delay aren't known yet, said Scott Koppelman of AMLI Residential, which also owns apartment complexes to the south and west of the construction site. The benefits to the community 'outweigh the costs,' he said Thursday. Mammoths and mastodons were ancient elephant relatives that roamed North American lands that were not covered in ice. Both became extinct as glaciers retreated at the end of the Ice Age. Not the first time: Fossilised mammoths have been found several times in Seattle, so much so that it was made Washington's state fossil . Collection: The Burke museum has 25 fossils from King County, including a tooth that was found a few blocks away from the tusk during a different project . Columbian mammoths grew to 12 feet at the shoulder, or about the size of today's Asian elephants, the museum said. Fossilized mammoth remains have been found numerous times in the Seattle area and across the state, so much so that the Columbian mammoth is the state's official fossil. Still, most of the Burke Museum's collection is made of fragments. The tusk found this week would be one of the largest and most intact specimens found.

Chancellor George Osborne will use Wednesday’s spending review to set out plans to invest an extra £15 billion in capital spending over the course of the next Parliament. Unusually, Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander will make a further statement to the Commons the following day setting out details of infrastructure spending, with dozens of road projects expected to get the go-ahead. Mr Balls confirmed yesterday that Labour would stick, for the first year of a government at least, to the coalition’s day-to-day spending plans. On ‘day to day spending, we’re saying we’ll have to make changes within their plans; we’re not going to be spending more,’ the shadow Chancellor said. But he went on: ‘On capital spending, we’re saying this year and next year, the Chancellor should be investing to get the economy growing. Head to head: Shadow chancellor Ed Balls, left, with Chancellor George Osborne argued today about how they would rescue the British economy, although Labour has been forced to adopt some of the coalition's plans . ‘I’m not going to say to you today two years ahead what our judgement will be. We’ll wait till nearer the time. But do I think there is a case, could be a case in two years’ time for still investing in roads and our infrastructure to get the economy moving and the deficit down? Yes. ‘The reason is because if the economy is still weak then, living standards are still falling, if youth unemployment is still high and if there’s still a case on our long-term infrastructure to get things moving with interest rates low, of course there’s a case for doing that. It would be economically very foolish to deny that.’ The Conservatives seized on Mr Balls’ remarks as evidence that Mr Miliband’s claim his party would show ‘discipline’ was meaningless. Sparring match: Mr Balls said on the Andrew Marr Show that if he became Chancellor he would consider borrowing more for major infrastructure building immediately . Economic Secretary to the Treasury Sajid Javid said: ‘Ed Miliband’s spending “discipline” has barely lasted five minutes as Ed Balls admits Labour would still spend more and borrow more. That’s the same old Labour approach that got us into this mess in the first place. ‘Hardworking people would pay the price with higher interest rates and higher bills.’ Mr Osborne insisted yesterday that while the economy now appeared to be ‘out of intensive care’, it could slide back into crisis if the Government abandons its austerity programme. The Chancellor told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show that the budget deficit was still too high and he was committed to finding further savings in Whitehall spending worth £11.5 billion. ‘There certainly is a chance of a . relapse if we abandon our economic plan,’ he said, arguing that instead . of ‘learning the lessons of what went wrong on their watch’ Labour was . making it clear ‘they would still borrow more’. Accusations: Ed Balls maintained that if Mr Osborne had borrowed more money to spend on building 'we wouldn't have had such a flat-lining economy' ‘I think we are moving from rescue to recovery, and you can see that because the economy’s growing, unemployment is coming down, there’s a record number of people in work. ‘Now it’s still going to be of course a challenge because the economic problems that Britain built up over many years are considerable and you can see what’s happening elsewhere in the world, but I think we are out of intensive care and our job now is to secure the recovery. ‘I think if Britain suddenly said we don’t have the confidence to deal with our debts, we’re not prepared to confront our problems as a nation, then we would go back into intensive care. And that’s what this week is all about. It’s about making clear that we are going to secure that recovery. ‘We’re going to go on taking the difficult decisions, go on cutting back spending, go on prioritising spending on the things that help the economy and cutting the spending that doesn’t.’","George Osborne will detail his Whitehall budget savings next week .

As a 53-year-old facelift patient jumped to her death from the roof of an exclusive Beverly Hills clinic, a reality TV star tweeted her shock at the tragic event. The unnamed woman, reported to have been a patient of surgeon to the stars Dr Brian Novack, was said to have been recovering from an operation when she became agitated and fled to the roof. As emergency crews arrived to try to reach out to the woman, Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Lisa Vanderpump tweeted about the incident. Plunge: Sandra D'Auriol jumped from the roof of a clinic in Los Angeles (black building, pictured right) The reality TV star's Villa Blanca restaurant is close to Novack's sleek North Camden Drive clinic. At 10.15am on Wednesday she tweeted in reply to two followers: 'Yes a woman has jumped to her death and you are right it is in front of Villa Blanca ...very sad.' A short while later she tweeted: 'Outside VB the road is blocked ... Sadly a woman threatening to commit suicide for the last few hours has followed thru. Terrible scene.' Staff at Novack's clinic confirmed to the Hollywood Reporter that the woman had been a patient at the clinic, where she had been given a facelift the day before. An official comment has not been made by the surgery, and an unidentified man told the Hollywood Reporter: 'We are not giving out any information about the incident that happened at our building.' The moment of the fatal fall on Wednesday was filmed on a cell phone by an unidentified person. The distressing footage shows the roads around the 15-storey building cordoned off with police tape, as a gaggle of passers by stare up to try to figure out what is happening. Shock: Vanderpump confirmed the tragic news of the leap to her Twitter followers . Along the edge of the building a figure suddenly jumps to her feet and heads to the farthest corner. The patient's identity has not been released but The Hollywood Reporter has learned that she had been staying overnight under supervision at Novack's sleek clinic on North Camden Drive in Beverly Hills after a facelift. According to the celebrity news site, . the woman - described as blonde and Caucasian - became agitated, took . off her hospital gown and fled from the 10th-floor clinic, running up to . the roof five storeys up. Police . received a report at about 7am about a partially clothed woman standing . on the roof of the Camden Medical Arts building located near Rodeo . Drive and threatening to jump. 'Real Housewives of Beverly Hills' star Lisa Vanderpump took to Twitter to say Mrs D'Auriol's death occurred just a few feet from her Villa Blanca restaurant. The reality television star called the tragedy 'very sad' A crisis negotiation team was dispatched to the scene and tried to talk the woman down for about three hours, but to no avail. ‘She sat on the ledge naked, then got up and walked around the edge of the building as if on a tightrope,’ a witness, describing the harrowing scene, said. ‘She sat back down again before getting up and jumping off.’ Surgeon to the stars: Dr Brian Novack owns the clinic where Sandra D'Auriol was staying . The unnamed victim was rushed to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead. The Beverly Hills Police Department and the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office are withholding the patient's name. An employee who works for another doctor in the building told The Hollywood Reporter that she saw Novack in the lobby afterwards, and that he 'looked demolished.' Novack, a graduate of McGill University, is highly regarded among Hollywood's leading ladies - and probably some gentlemen - as much for his impressive scalpel skills as for his discretion. He has been credited with performing facelifts and various nip/tuck procedures on some of the biggest stars in the entertainment business - but the press-shy Novack was never one to drop names. In 2012, the site Bungalux described Novack as the 'best plastic surgeon no one will recommend' because his famous patients pay top dollar to look like they've had no work done at all. The glowing review stated that Novack schedules only three procedures a week and takes up to 12 hours per surgery. ‘His noses and facelifts are the best in the world, and he was one of the first proponents of fat transfer to the face,’ Bungalux raved. Tragic: A crisis negotiation team was sent to the building to try to talk Sandra D'Auriol down . Leading surgeon: Novack, left, is considered one of the best and most expensive plastic surgeons catering to A-listers like Demi Moore, right, 51, who is rumored to have paid top dollar for a series of procedures . It has been widely rumored that the youthful looking 'GI Jane' star Demi Moore, 51, had paid Novack close to $80,000 for various procedures, including a facelift, liposuction and surgery on her breasts. In 2004, a friend of the actress said of Novack: ‘He's a fantastic surgeon and his clients don't look like they've had surgery.’ Moore herself, however, has vehemently denied that she had ever had any work done on her face or body.","Lisa Vanderpump confirms fatal leap happened near her Villa Blanca restaurant .

UPDATED: . 09:34 EST, 24 June 2013 . The parents of a five-month-old baby girl who suffers with an incredibly rare skin condition have spoken out about how they are scared to hold her for fear of pulling her skin off. Lexie-Mae Bravender is constantly covered in blisters due to an extremely rare incurable skin disease called Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB). Lexie-Mae's skin is so sensitive that it can tear if she is even picked up, her feet are permanently wrapped up in bandages, and she has to be given morphine before she can even be bathed. Mother Kerry Quinn and father Mike Bravender (pictured) are scared to cuddle their baby because of the rare condition she suffers with. Five-month-old Lexi-Mae has Epidermolysis Bullosa which causes her skin to blister . The child must be dressed with her clothes turned inside-out to avoid the seams rubbing against her skin, and all labels must be cut out of anything she wears. Lexie-Mae, from Blackley, Manchester, has such a severe form of the disorder that she not only gets sores and blisters on her skin, her mouth, throat and eyes are also affected. Mother Kerry Quinn, 34, said: 'When we first discovered what Lexie-Mae's condition was, we were scared to pick her up at all, and that caused a lot of difficulty with bonding. 'I was afraid to touch her in case I hurt her but I wanted to give her a cuddle and make sure she was comfortable. At first doctors thought Lexie-Mae had been born with birthmarks on her feet or that the redness could be sign of infection. It wasn't until they saw blisters on her back that they suspected she had something more serious . 'We have to be careful what we wear when we do pick her up and all jewellery or anything that could scratch her skin has to come straight off. We can't be too careful.' Lexie-Mae's daily routine means her parents Kerry and Michael, 47, have to pop her blisters, apply cream to them and dress her in soft clothing and nappies. But when she was born, Lexie-Mae had no skin on her feet at all, but doctors were baffled as to what could be wrong with her. Doctors thought Lexie-Mae might be suffering from early chickenpox. It looked like chicken pox. Eventually they confirmed she has the incredibly rare skin condition Epidermolysis bullosa . 'At first they thought they were birthmarks on her feet, and then they thought it could be an infection,' Kerry said. 'They weren't really sure and doctors were at a loss. 'But then they changed her nappy and we saw she had started to blister on her back and her bottom. It looked like chicken pox. 'Finally they confirmed she had EB, but still no-one was too sure as to how to treat her.' Epidermolysis . bullosa is a severe genetic skin disorder that affects around 5,000 . sufferers in the UK, and only 500,000 worldwide. The condition causes blisters to develop anywhere on the skin, and the mouth and eyes are particularly susceptible to the sores. Heat exacerbates the condition . Skin is made up of two layers; the outer layer is the epidermis and the inner layer is the dermis. In healthy skin, proteins hold the two layers together so they do not move separately. In those born with EB, the layers do . not have the protein that holds them together. It means that any . movement that creates friction between the two layers creates blisters. Blisters . can develop anywhere on the skin, and the mouth and eyes are . particularly susceptible to the sores. Heat exacerbates the condition. Lexie-Mae's feet are permanently bandaged, her clothes must be inside-out to prevent seams rubbing against her and she must be given morphine before being bathed . Some sufferers are born with blisters but others will develop them in the first few weeks of their life. Lexie-Mae was diagnosed with Recessive Dystrophic EB, which means she also has an exceptionally high risk of developing skin cancer as a teenager. Kerry, a teaching assistant, said: 'Her skin is incredibly sensitive. I pulled her little vest off the . other day and felt skin come away from underneath her arm. 'It's terrifying because it feels like I'm hurting her. We have to be so careful. 'She . rolled over recently, and while it was exciting to see to begin with, . we then thought about how much more damage she could do just by being a . normal baby. Lexie-Mae was diagnosed with Recessive Dystrophic EB, which means she also has an exceptionally high risk of developing skin cancer as a teenager . 'She will struggle with crawling and it's often hard to find the right shoes for EB babies because of the pain in their feet.' Lexie-Mae is in so much constant pain that she is permanently dosed up on the maximum amounts of paracetamol and ibuprofen, and when she has her dressings changed, she has to be given morphine. Kerry and Michael are . supported by a specially trained nurse funded by EB charity Debra, who . help them with Lexie-Mae's condition and dressings. Lexie Mae's father, Michael, a bus driver, said when he takes her out, people stare at her because they don't know what's wrong with her. Sometimes he worries that people think he has hurt her . Kerry said: 'Our nurse has such a healthy outlook and says Lexie-Mae doesn't know she is any different. 'It's a normal pain to Lexie-Mae, just like having a headache is to us. 'We just want her to have a happy life and not be in any pain. 'She's inspirational because we think of what she is going through and she doesn't let it get to her.' 'Inspirational': Kerry says she just wants Lexie-Mae to have a happy life and not be in any pain. She hopes that by telling Lexie's story she will raise awareness of the rare condition . Kerry and Michael are trying to raise awareness about the condition and the charity Debra, after finding there was very little knowledge of EB. Michael, a bus driver, said: 'When we take her out, people stare at her because they don't know what's wrong with her. 'A lot of people think she has chicken pox, but in the summer months when her feet are on show, they assume it's something terrible. 'We worry that people think it's something we have done wrong. We just want people to know EB exists and realise Lexie-Mae is just a normal little girl.'","Lexie-Mae Bravender suffers from Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB), an incurable condition that causes the skin to tear and blister very easily .

Disciplined: Magistrate Yvonne Davies has been reprimanded after telling Christopher Duncan who she was sentencing for growing cannabis that addiction to the drug had led to the death of her  brother . A magistrate has been forced to resign after she told how cannabis led to her  brother’s untimely death when she sentenced a drug dealer. Great-grandmother Yvonne  Davies issued a heartfelt plea to the cannabis grower to mend his ways as she described the devastating impact of her brother’s drugs addiction on her family. Even though Mrs Davies says she had spoken about her family’s experience ‘hundreds of times’ during her 14 years on the bench, she was told that her actions fell ‘well below’ the standards expected. Following four complaints – including one from a pro-cannabis campaigner – Mrs Davies was officially reprimanded. The decision was signed off by Lord Chancellor Chris Grayling and the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Judge. But the 65-year-old former chairman of the bench said her position was made ‘untenable’ following a ‘back-to-work’ interview, during which she says she was repeatedly asked to resign by senior colleagues. She quit last week. Mrs Davies said: ‘I feel disgusted and let down. I was in the business of ensuring justice prevailed but there is absolutely no justice in what has happened to me. ‘I could not go back into an organisation where I felt I was being gagged  and pilloried for speaking out about a substance which is illegal in this country. ‘I feel devastated that I have given the magistracy 14 years of my life and spoken about my brother’s death hundreds of times helping hundreds of offenders and this is how I am repaid. It is despicable.’ In August last year, Mrs Davies, who also works as a psychotherapist and mental health counsellor, spoke out about the death of her brother while sentencing Christopher Duncan, 55, to 200 hours unpaid work for growing cannabis. Mrs Davies, told how her family went through a ‘living hell’ after her brother Glen Harding died aged 39. He developed epilepsy, schizophrenia and depression following years of smoking cannabis and was found dead in a canal in 1997. Following the hearing,  and Mrs Davies’ interviews in local and national media, the Office for Judicial Complaints (OJC) launched an investigation into the way she had expressed her personal views on the case. This was triggered by complaints from three retired  magistrates and a pro-cannabis campaigner who asked for Mrs Davies to be removed from her position immediately. Mrs Davies was then suspended. However, after a ten-month investigation the OJC opted only to reprimand her. Then, during a back-to- work interview, she claims requests were made for her resignation by a justice clerk and a liaison judge and she resigned on Friday. Mrs Davies said: ‘I was suspended immediately and it was made very clear that I wasn’t going to be receiving any support. ‘I just felt incredibly shocked and upset at the way I was being treated. I had not committed a criminal act – I was genuinely trying to help others.’ Experience: The 65-year-old chairman of the bench had cited the 'living hell' her family went through after losing her brother Glen Harding, pictured . The decision to suspend and investigate Mrs Davies was criticised by an anti-social behaviour reduction charity. Nick Buckley, who runs Mancunian Way, said: ‘We find that  it’s not until someone dealing drugs meet families and victims caught up in the trade that things change. ‘I think the way this magistrate has spoken to this defendant is right. She might not be following the rule book exactly but it’s these personal stories which will reach someone.’ And Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of the mental health charity Sane, also voiced support for Mrs Davies. She said: ‘It is extremely  sad that Yvonne Davies has chosen to resign over this issue, but she has done a  service in highlighting the dangers that cannabis can pose to those who are vulnerable to mental illness. ‘There is a growing body of evidence linking cannabis, especially in its strong form skunk, to mental illness, with all the damage that can inflict on individuals and their families.’ Tragic: Glen Harding developed schizophrenia and epilepsy, apparently as a result of cannabis use. He is pictured here with his father Les Harding in 1987 . In a statement the OJC confirmed that Mrs Davies was made subject to an investigation following the ‘expression of personal views in court’ and subsequent media interviews. A statement read: ‘The investigation found the views expressed in court were inappropriate. ‘The Lord Chancellor and Lord Chief Justice agreed and concluded that her combined actions fell below the standard of behaviour expected of a magistrate and have issued Mrs Davies with a reprimand.’ Mrs Davies, who lives with her husband Ernie, 65, in Partington, Greater Manchester, remained defiant last night. She said: ‘It is ludicrous that as a magistrate I cannot cite a personal experience where there have been devastating consequences because of cannabis abuse. ‘It is also doubly astounding that the views of a pro-cannabis campaigner were used to build a case against me. As far as I am aware, cannabis is still very much illegal in Britain. ‘But I don’t regret any of it and I would speak out again about the dangers of using drugs. My brother lost his life because of it and if I can save others from the devastation it causes I will. ‘When I spoke out I received dozens of letters of support from families whose children were abusing drugs telling me that they were grateful – even just for those it was worth it.’","Yvonne .

The specially-engineered skinsuits made for the U.S. speedskating team have been dropped after being blamed for the team's poor performance during the first week of the Winter Olympics. The Under Armour suits, made specifically for each member of the team, will be dropped and the team will return to their old kit after complaining that the design was ruining their medal chances. No U.S. skater has finished higher than seventh in six of the 12 Olympic events so far in Sochi, despite the speedskaters dominating competitions in the run up to the Games. Unsuitable: The uniforms worn by the U.S. speedskating team are largely being blamed for their poor performance. Here Canadian skater Charles Hamelin (front) takes Gold while America trails behind .

Kelly Gunther of the United States competes during the Women's 1000m Speed Skating event on day 6 of the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics at Adler Arena Skating Center on February 13, 2014 in Sochi, Russia . The International Olympic Committee has agreed to allow the Americans to switch to their old kit, as long as it had been approved at the start of the season. Under Olympic rules every member of the team must be wearing the same type of kit. Skaters had complained that vents on the backs of the suits were letting air in, which was affecting their performance. The high-tech suits, developed in relation with aerospace and . defense giant Lockheed Martin, were touted as the 'fastest speedskating . suit in the world'. Because they were only recently completed, the team didn't get to try the Mach 39 suits in the competitive arena until the start of the Games. U.S. Speedskating executive director Ted Morris told the Wall Street Journal the team had been divided about the suits. 'The . general feeling from the athletes, it's pretty darn close to 50-50,' Morris said on Friday, one day before the team agreed to switch back to . the old outfits. Netherlands' Irene Wust and US Brittany Bowe (L) compete during the Women's Speed Skating 1000 m at the Adler Arena during the Sochi Winter Olympics on February 13 . The new ones had been exclusively . designed for the U.S. team. Under Armour scientists had visited their training facility in Salt Lake City and used a 3D image scanner to . capture highly accurate digital measurements of the athletes from every . angle. The final design featured strategically-placed polyurethane strips on the forearms, calves and forehead to reduce drag by breaking up the airflow, just like the dimples on a golf ball. On the inside of the thighs, patches of ArmourGlide are said to reduce friction by 65 percent. Among the U.S. athletes to under-perform is female star Heather Richardson, who has admitted to making alterations to her suit. 'They . did adjust one part on the back, but it was just putting rubber over . the mesh there,' she said after a hugely disappointing performance in . the 1,000, a race she dominated during the World Cup season.'It had no . effect, really.' Similarly, Shani Davis was a two-time Olympic champion in the men's 1,000 and looking to become the first male speedskater to win the same event at three straight games. His eighth-place showing Wednesday was the first indication that something might be seriously wrong with the U.S. team's preparation. US Shani Davis competes in the the Men's Speed Skating 1000 m at the Adler Arena during the Sochi Winter Olympics on February 12, 2014 . 'I'm honestly being as optimistic as I can possibly be,' he said. 'I'm . just staying focused on the 1,500-meter race. Suit or no suit, I've got . to go out there and try to win. That's what I'm going to do.' Despite the switch, both the coaches and Under Armour have defended the suits and what they are capable of. 'The . evidence does not  suggest that the suits have contributed to the . disappointing results to date,' USA Speed Skating Executive Director Ted . Morris said in a statement that was emailed to CBS News. 'However, there are many factors that determine Olympic success and we are constantly making adjustments to improve results.' Under Armour also provided a statement from Kevin Haley, the Senior Vice President of Innovation. 'While a multitude of factors ultimately determine on-ice success, many skaters have posted personal-best sea-level heat times, split times or race times this week, and we're rooting for that to translate into medals over these next couple of days,' he said. Coach Kip Carpenter had scoffed at the notion that the suits are the only reason for the American struggles. 'The human factor is by far the largest piece out there,' he said. 'There's not an athlete out there who is slowing down a second per lap because of the suit they're in. 'Anyone who thinks that doesn't know speed skating. What is it: a parachute on their back? There are guys out there in low-technology suits. 'The Germans are out there ... in mostly Lycra suits with some rubber, and they're wiping us all over the place.' American skater Joey Mantia, who finished 15th in the 1,000m and who will also race in the 1,500m with Davis, said the disappointing results had soured the mood in the camp with six events remaining. 'We are all a little down right now,' said the former inline skater. 'We could make a list of everything that's wrong, it could be the suits, could be the food, we don't know.'","No U.S. skater has finished higher than seventh after six Olympic events .

Fire stations across the country are in financial limbo as they wait for the IRS ruling on whether they have to provide volunteer firefighters medical insurance under Obamacare. According to the Affordable Health Care Act, businesses with more than 50 full-time employees are required to provide health insurance for them, a full-time employee defined as someone who works over 30 hours a week. Pennsylvania Representative Lou Barletta, a Republican, says that having to provide insuance will 'threaten public safety' by putting 'unbearable financial burdens' on already cash-strapped stations. Financial burden: Pennsylvania Representative Lou Barletta visits the Duncannon Fire Company. He is looking to pass legislation that will exempt volunteer firefighters from Obamacare . Rep Barletta along with Mark Warner, the Democratic Senator from Virginia, are sponsoring legislation to exempt volunteer fire, medical and rescue personnel from full-time status. 'This is just another example of how Obamacare was not well thought out,' Rep Barletta said on December 11 while introducing the Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act. 'So, we're left to try to pave over the potholes. And this is a big one - possibly affecting fire stations nationwide.' Rep Barletta says the broad definition of full-time employee is hard to apply to a fire station staff. 'Does it mean when a volunteer is wearing a beeper or carrying a fire department cell phone?' Barletta asks. 'Does it include downtime at the station house? Listening to a scanner? These are all legimimate questions raised since ObamaCare has been forced on Americans.' Changing the law: Rep Barletta believes Obamacare will be too much of a financial burden on already cash-strapped fire companies . Rep Barletta wrote to the IRS in November asking for clarifications on whether the new legislation applies to these volunteer workers but they have not given an official ruling yet. 'We are taking those comments into account as we work toward issuing final regulations on the employer provision, 4980H of the Internal Revenue Code,' Treasury spokeswoman Victoria Esser told The Patriot-News. 'Pending issuance of the final reulations, it would bot be appropriate for us to comment on their likely content.' No matter what the decision, the stations won't have to provide insurance until 2015, since the 'employer mandate' part of the act was delayed to give officials more time to work out the regulations.","Under the Affordable Care Act, all businesses with over 50 full-time employees must provide them health care .

A teacher had sex with a 16-year-old boy pupil in her car - and told him he would be 'a legend' among his friends, a disciplinary hearing was told today. Emma Ager, 34, picked the teenager up after classes to have sex in her car, according to evidence from a professional conduct hearing in Cardiff. The hearing was told the English teacher, who worked at Rhymney Comprehensive School in Tredegar, South Wales, told the boy: 'I bet you won’t be able to keep up with me during sex.' Emma Ager, 34, a teacher who worked at Rhymney Comprehensive School, in Tredegar, South Wales, has been struck off for life after having sex sessions with a 16-year-old boy pupil in her car . The boy - referred to as Pupil A in the hearing - was studying for his GSCEs when Miss Ager began driving him to secret sex sessions in a factory car park. He told the hearing that his relationship with Miss Ager began after a friend managed to get hold of her mobile phone number. His pal rang the teacher from Pupil A's phone as a prank - but she rang back. Pupil A said: 'We chatted and she put a bet on me not being able to keep up with her during sex.' The former pupil, who is now 22, said he told Miss Ager he was a 16-year-old pupil at her comprehensive school. The South Wales school attended by the pupil. Now 22, he said the teacher kept a picture of his penis on her mobile phone . Pupil A said: 'She said as long as I kept quiet everything would be OK. 'Following this we would meet up daily or every other day. 'We would meet up an hour or two after school and drive and have sex in her car. We would drive to a secluded spot near a factory. 'We only ever had sex in her car. 'She said if people did find out I would be a legend. It continued for two months. 'One of my friends rang her up to ask for a threesome but she said she wouldn’t do it. 'It was common knowledge among pupils in the school but I don’t know if the teachers knew. I left a short time after it ended.' The pupil told the hearing Miss Ager bombarded him with phone calls and sexual text messages during the two-month relationship in March 2008 . The hearing was told Miss Ager had been teaching for two years at the school when she began having sex with the pupil. The boy claimed Miss Ager had a picture of his penis on her mobile phone. He told the hearing he bombarded him with phone calls and sexual text messages during the two-month relationship in March 2008. Pupil A told the hearing: 'My friends knew what was going on and she would pick me and my friends up to go to McDonald’s and let them drive her car. 'I never had extra tuition from her but one day she said she would do my coursework for me - but she never did. 'On a school trip to London somebody saw she had a photo of my penis on her mobile phone but she said it was somebody else’s. 'She brought me back a teddy and some sweets.' Pupil A ended the liaison to be get back with his ex-girlfriend. The General Teaching Council for Wales professional conduct hearing in Cardiff heard Pupil A’s mother found out her son was getting inappropriate phone calls and texts from Miss Ager. She told the school about the calls from Miss Ager - but she did not know it was a sexual relationship. GTCW presenting solicitor Martin Jones said Miss Ager was pulled into a meeting with her head teacher about inappropriate contact with Pupil A. Mr Jones said: 'As a result of that she offered her resignation and it was accepted. 'She left the school a short while later.' Headteacher Meredydd James is accused of giving good references for future jobs as she left the school. The hearing was told it was later discovered to be a sexual relationship when school staff went on a safeguarding course - and told council officials about rumours of the affair between teacher and pupil. Miss Ager is accused of unacceptable professional conduct and falling short of the standard expected of a registered teacher by having an inappropriate and sexual relationship with a 16-year-old pupil. She is not at the disciplinary hearing and has failed to answer the charges. The school’s former headteacher Mr James, now retired, is accused of failing to follow proper child protection procedures and take appropriate action. Mr James denies the charges against him.

Two thugs who stabbed a defenceless driver 13 times and ran off laughing as they left him for dead have been jailed for a total of 21 and a half years. Kieran Wright, 27, and Lee Daniels, 26, attacked the 60-year-old motorist for the keys to his Mercedes in a bungled car-jacking, but fled the scene without the £36,000 car. Victim Stephen Briggs-Bennett was left with life-changing injuries after the broad-daylight attack on the driveway of a relative’s property on February 17. His attackers later went out boozing on lager and vodka and were seen laughing and joking together. When police approached Wright he said: 'I was going to come in tonight but United are playing at 7.30pm so I wanted to watch that first.' And when officers arrested drunken Daniels for attempted murder, he said: 'Ha ha, no way.' Mr Briggs-Bennett, a company supervisor, was leaving the home of his late father-in-law after popping round to do gather some things. He was suddenly confronted by Wright and Daniels as he was about to get into his car in Hindley, near Wigan. Wright, who was wearing a balaclava, grabbed the victim by his collar from behind and demanded his car keys before stabbing him with a double-bladed ornamental dagger. The victim initially thought he was being punched, but then realised he was 'absolutely swimming in blood' and feared he would die. Wright and Daniels, who was wearing a baseball cap and hood, were seen kicking Mr Briggs-Bennett as he lay defenceless on the ground. The two men then grabbed a bunch of keys which he had dropped and tried to get into the Mercedes but ran off when they realised the set did not include the car key. After the attack, Wright and Daniels . ran to the nearby home of a female friend. They later got a taxi - . stopping at a shop to buy lager and vodka. Police later recovered the dagger from a drain. Attack: Mr Briggs-Bennett was stabbed in broad-daylight on the drive of his late father-in-law's house .

Jailed: Lee Daniels, 26, (left) and Kieran Wright, 27, (right) were jailed for a total of 21 years for the attack . Mr Briggs-Bennett staggered to a neighbour’s bungalow to ask for help. He later underwent an hour-long operation at Wigan Infirmary to stem the profuse bleeding. He was then transferred to Whiston Hospital, Merseyside, where he had five hours of surgery to try to repair the damage. Boozing: The pair went out drinking after the brutal attack . The knife had caused injuries to his shoulder, neck, face and arm, including a 10cm slash to his left arm which cut down to the bone and severed 90 per cent of his radial nerve. Another cut sliced through the muscle on his arm, while a third wound to his finger has damaged nerves, arteries and tendons. Doctors have said Mr Briggs-Bennett, who is still an outpatient and is having twice weekly physiotherapy sessions, may never fully recover and is unable to grip items. He needs help from his wife with everyday tasks like getting dressed. He has returned to work part time but can no longer drive or do DIY, both of which he enjoyed. He also has to wear a brace and splint to aid his recovery. In a statement he said he did not believe his attackers will ever realise how severely they have damaged his life. Last Friday at Liverpool Crown Court, Daniels and Wright both pleaded guilty to inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent, attempted robbery and possession of an offensive weapon. Daniels was given ten and a half years and Wright, who also admitted an unrelated offence of taking a vehicle without consent, was jailed for 11 years. Det Sgt Graham Clare from Wigan Police division, said: 'Thankfully the victim survived this horrendous, unprovoked attack. 'He has recovered enough for him to be able to return to work, but has been left with life-changing injuries which are a constant reminder of the terror he felt that morning. 'It is by chance and not design that his horrific injuries did not prove fatal. He was stabbed numerous times just so these would-be thieves could steal his car. 'His life has been irrevocably changed for the worse and there is no sentence that can alter that.

Thousands of social housing tenants have been wrongly hit by the so-called 'bedroom tax' and are in line for a refund of their money, it has emerged. A loophole in the Government's welfare reforms means what ministers call the spare-room subsidy does not apply to certain renters who have lived in the same home for more than 17 years. Housing experts have claimed 40,000 people could be affected, but the Department of Work and Pensions has stressed that it believes a maximum of 5,000 tenants are likely to have been caught up. Loophole: Thousands of social housing tenants wrongly hit by the unpopular 'bedroom tax' could be due a refund . It has written to local authorities alerting them to the glitch and insists new regulations will be introduced swiftly to rectify the oversight. Shadow welfare reform minister Chris Bryant told the Guardian: 'This is the latest example of the chaos and confusion within the Department of Work and Pensions under Iain Duncan Smith. 'Rather than closing loopholes in the policy, the Government should scrap their hated bedroom tax. If they don't, the next Labour government will.' Plea: Shadow welfare reform minister Chris Bryant said the Government should scrap the 'hated' tax . Under the Government's welfare reform, social tenants deemed to have more bedrooms than they need have had their housing benefit reduced. Ministers say private sector renters do not get spare rooms for free, and argue the change will save around £500 million annually. But it has sparked protests across the country with opponents claiming it is forcing families into poverty and will increase the benefits bill by pushing people into the private sector. The error affects tenants in social housing on housing benefit whose claim has not changed since before 1996 as they are covered by old regulations, which were mistakenly left unchanged under the Government's reforms. It could amount to a refund of at least £640 per claimant, according to the Guardian. Joe Halewood, an independent housing consultant, said estimates that 40,000 people were affected were based on projections following information from Exeter City council, which has found that 4.5% of those hit by the penalty were wrongly held liable. He told the Guardian's housing network website: 'Forty thousand is actually a conservative estimate. You're looking at one in 25 of housing benefit claimants being affected."" A DWP spokesman said: 'We are looking at this issue carefully and working with local authorities, and we will take any necessary action in due course. We expect very few people to be affected.'","Certain renters who have lived in the same home for 17 years are exempt .

Earlier this month, defender Bardsley had described team spirit under Di Canio as 'beyond dead' while Cattermole said he was close to quitting the north east club.

"By . Lucy Elkins . PUBLISHED: . 19:10 EST, 10 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 19:10 EST, 10 February 2014 . Ann Pascoe's husband Andrew had always been a gentle, mild-mannered man. So . when he was diagnosed with dementia seven years ago, she expected him . to be forgetful and become more dependent - what she was not ready for . were his aggressive outbursts. Andrew, . 65, a former naval engineer, had always had a caring nature. 'Yet after . he developed dementia, from time to time he would get very agitated - . sometimes he would throw things - for no  reason,' says Ann, 67, a . businesswomen. 'He might . come in from the garden and just suddenly shout: “I'm not doing it any . more,” and slam the door and storm up upstairs. After Andrew developed dementia, from time to time he would get very agitated - and even throw things . 'It was incredibly upsetting and I was permanently walking on eggshells but thought that this must just be part of the dementia. 'I was getting to the stage where I felt I couldn't cope any more.' Then, . last August, she discovered there was more to these outbursts than she . realised. Andrew, who tries to lead as independent a life as possible, . had fainted at the bus stop in the village near where the couple live in . Helmsdale, Scotland. An . ambulance was called and a doctor found Ann's details in Andrew's wallet . and called her. 'He said Andrew seemed very confused and was mentioning . something about pain but wasn't making much sense,' she recalls. In . fact, Andrew had been diagnosed with neuropathic (nerve) pain in his . legs two years before. 'He'd tried a variety of painkillers and said . they didn't work, but now I wonder if he took them,' says Ann. 'He had said he was hurting from time to time but as he had not been very specific I had not taken it that seriously.' The . doctor suggested Ann keep a 'pain diary' for her husband for two weeks, . getting him to rate his discomfort on a scale of one to ten at various . times of the day. 'When he was sitting down he said it was a two out of . ten; when he walked in the garden it was as high as a nine,' she says. Ann Pascoe from Helmsdale, Scottish Highlands is now dealing with her husbands's dementia . Analysing . the diary, the doctor realised Andrew was in considerable pain a lot of . the time and prescribed him Gabapentin, an epilepsy drug that . interrupts the transmission of pain signals in the brain. This . time Ann watched her husband like a hawk to ensure he took it and, sure . enough, the aggressive outbursts all but stopped. 'Now I realise that . his agitation was not the dementia - it was a result of his pain - he . just didn't know how to tell me,' she says. Andrew told Ann he often couldn't find the words to explain many everyday events - including his levels of pain. The . couple's story highlights an extraordinary new understanding of the . behaviour of dementia patients - and could help transform their, and . their carers', lives. For . a growing body of research has found that many of the symptoms often . written off as 'just a part of dementia' - agitation, aggression, . withdrawal or repeatedly asking for attention - are actually untreated . pain. Indeed, pain is . the biggest cause of such symptoms - including even language breakdown . -  according to a recent review in the journal Clinical Intervention In . Ageing. However, the . authors concluded that while pain is often the underlying cause of some . behaviour, patients may be given 'inappropriate' sedating medication . instead. It's not that . dementia causes pain, but the 800,000 people in this country with the . disease tend to be older and therefore more prone to aches and pains. Many patients lose the ability to talk, but even those who are coherent . may struggle to find the right words to describe their discomfort. The . problem is that not all health professionals or carers are yet aware of . this, so they dismiss changes to behaviour such as becoming agitated as . part of dementia, says Pat Schofield, professor of nursing at the . University of Greenwich. 'Historically, . we used to believe that people with dementia do not feel pain because . of the effects that their illness has on the brain but in recent years . we realised that is not so,' she adds. 'They are just as likely to . suffer with pain but they cannot express it. 'Think . how frustrating that must be - you can't find the words to tell . someone, “I'm in agony”, or, “This is hurting”,' says Prof Schofield. Scientists . from King's College London and Norway found that when they gave daily . pain treatment to patients with 'significant behavioural disturbance', . their agitation was 'severely reduced'. Their . study, published in the British Medical Journal in 2011, said that . properly treating pain could reduce 'unnecessary prescriptions for . psychotropic drugs' - drugs such as antipsychotics. For . years, agitated or aggressive dementia patients have been given . antipsychotics, which act on the brain and sedates them. In 2009, a . government-funded report found that 180,000 dementia patients in England . were on antipsychotics, yet it estimated as few as 36,000 were getting . any benefit. Furthermore, . the drugs carry a risk of significant side-effects - the report . suggested they were linked to 1,620 strokes a year and an additional . 1,800 deaths. 'In the past, . there was a tendency to think, “Oh dear, this patient is agitated, we . better give them a chemical cosh,” rather than think, “What could be . causing this?”' says London GP Dr Sarah Jarvis, who contributed to a . recent report on dementia and pain. 'Then there were anxieties about the drugs' side-effects, and we are using them less and less.' However, . prescriptions are still too high. A two-year study completed last April . by University College London and funded by the Alzheimer's Society . found that three-quarters of dementia patients in hospital displayed . agitation or aggression and that 'staff are  still using sedative and . neuroleptic drugs to manage these'. The problem, suggests Dr Jarvis, is . that while 'the message has got across that we should be prescribing . fewer antipsychotics, still health professionals are not necessarily . thinking of pain as a cause [for challenging behaviour]'. Many . dementia patients end up in care homes. Dr Jarvis says she often finds . staff are unaware of the link between agitation and pain. 'I've . lost count of the number of times that I have had a dementia patient . not on antipsychotics and the care home will say to me: ""But they seem . to become agitated."" 'I . will suggest pain as a cause and they will say: “No, it can't be - they . aren't agitated all the time.” But the point is, pain does tend to come . and go.' Andrew told Ann he often couldn't find the words to explain many everyday events - including pain . A recent report . by Napp Pharmaceuticals found that a third of independent care and . residential homes had not reduced their antipsychotic use. Furthermore, . nearly 40 per cent said fewer than a quarter of their dementia patients . suffer with pain, yet surveys (such as one in Clinical Intervention In . Ageing) have found 50 per cent of dementia patients suffer with regular . pain and that the figure will be higher for those in care or residential . homes. 'A better awareness . of pain could transform the care of dementia patients,' says Dr . Jarvis.  Yet often carers like Ann have to deal with this challenging . behaviour unaware that their loved one's outburst might be easily cured . with pain medication. 'Every . day I see carers who are at the end of their tether and come in and ask . for tranquilisers to help with their loved ones behaviour,' says Dr . Jarvis. 'But we have to say to them first: “We need to try and find out what is causing this behaviour.” 'Now . there is a move, backed by the Alzheimer's Society and other . campaigners, to better identify and treat people with dementia who are . in pain. 'All too . often people with dementia suffering from unrecognised pain are . mistakenly deemed to be aggressive, uncooperative or withdrawn,' says Dr . Alison Cook, of the Alzheimer's Society. 'It is vitally important that care professionals have the tools and training to meet the complex needs of people with dementia.' It's a move welcomed by Ann. 'We . carers need to be told what to look for, what to expect,' she says. 'I . am sure there will have been people who will have been caring for loved . ones who will have thought they can't cope and sent their loved one off . to a home when actually had the pain been treated they could have . carried on. 'I'm relieved . not just that Andrew is less agitated but also that he has a better . quality of life. 'I plan to care for him for the duration of his . illness. 'A year ago, I was thinking: ""I hate this."" Now I feel as if our life is back on track.'","Ann Pascoe, 67, says her husband Andrew had always been mild-mannered .

"By . Emma Innes . PUBLISHED: . 08:21 EST, 24 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:53 EST, 24 June 2013 . A father-of-one was forced to Google his symptoms after 150 visits to doctors failed to provide him with a diagnosis. Carl Holt, 34, was subjected to two years of GP and hospital appointments after developing constant throat pain following a family holiday in July 2010. The sales manager lost four-and-a-half stone and went from playing football twice a week to being tired all of the time. Carl Holt, 34, developed a constant sore throat after returning from holiday in July 2010. He attended 150 GP and hospital appointments but none provided a diagnosis . Despite hospital appointments and visits to his doctor up to six times a month, medics could not work out what was wrong with him. Mr Holt feared he had cancer but after researching his symptoms on the internet and watching videos on YouTube, he found out about a rare condition called Eagle syndrome. Eagle syndrome occurs when a ligament at the back of the throat become calcified or hardened, or when a bone at the base of the skull becomes elongated. Symptoms include throat and ear pain. Sufferers often have the feeling something is stuck in their throat and have difficulty swallowing. Remarkably, despite telling doctors about the disease, Mr Holt was not tested for it at three separate GP practices or at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire. Mr Holt eventually Googled his symptoms and found out about Eagle syndrome - stiffening of a ligament at the back of the throat . Therefore, Mr Holt decided to pay for private care at Salford Hospital in Greater Manchester in October last year and was finally diagnosed with the rare medical condition. He has now criticised the NHS for failing to spot the condition despite the staggering number of GP and hospital appointments. Mr Holt, who lives in Stoke-on-Trent, said: ‘People started questioning my mental health because I was always at the doctors, yet they could never find out what was wrong with me. ‘Through research, I found out about a condition called Eagle syndrome, which seemed to tick all the symptoms I was suffering. ‘I saw videos about it on YouTube and Googled it but even though I told my doctors about it, no-one would believe me or test me for it. ‘It was so frustrating. The pain and the symptoms wouldn’t go away but doctors just weren’t interested and would just tell me to take painkillers. ‘I even paid to go and get second opinions privately but every time I did it was the same doctors I had seen on the NHS. ‘Because I had a sore throat for so long I thought I had throat cancer. ‘At the time I was on the cusp of becoming a father and I worried I would never get to see my daughter. ‘I felt anxious and depressed and contemplated suicide.  When I finally got the diagnosis, I felt a lot of relief.’ He added: ‘I saw a consultant in Manchester and within minutes of looking at my CT scan he confirmed it was Eagle syndrome. ‘I was appalled - it just shows that if all the other doctors listened to me instead of fobbing me off then I would have been diagnosed two years earlier.’ Mr Holt, who spent £10,000 trying to get a diagnosis, is now being treated as an NHS patient at Salford Royal Hospital. Before paying for private treatment,  Mr Holt told doctors at his GP surgery and at University Hospital of North Staffordshire (pictured) that he thought he had Eagle syndrome but he was not tested for it . He had anti-inflammatory injections in March this year and has a follow up appointment later this year to see if he needs surgery. Mr Holt, who lives with his wife Toni, 30, and daughter Ruby, two, said: ‘It was some sort of virus that set it all off. I felt tired all the time. I lost four-and-a-half stone in weight. Eagle syndrome is a collection of symptoms that include recurrent throat and ear pain, the feeling that there is something stuck at the back of the throat, difficulty swallowing and facial pain. The symptoms are caused by the elongation of the temporal bone, at the base of the skull, or by the calcification of the stylohyoid ligament at the back of the throat. The cause of the condition is poorly understood. It is diagnosed using X-Rays or scans and treatments can include injections and surgery. ‘I went from 18-stone, physically fit, playing football twice a week and leading a very active life, to simply going to work, then coming home and going to sleep. ‘I had injections that went straight into the styroid ligaments. It was the first time in over two years that I didn’t have a pain in my throat. ‘I still don’t feel 100 per cent, I would say I’m at 80 per cent now. ‘I’ve spent £10,000 over the two and a half years but at least I have answers now.’ His wife added: ‘I feel a bit guilty because I was one of the people thinking there was nothing wrong with him. ‘But Carl was right all along. ‘He went from being the life and soul of the party to a shadow of himself.’ A spokesman for University Hospital of North Staffordshire said: ‘We cannot comment on individual patient cases as the trust is bound by rules of patient confidentiality.'","Carl Holt, 34, developed a constant sore throat after returning from holiday .

Scientists at the University of Copenhagen said paying closer attention to avoidable risks could cut miscarriages by 25 per cent . One in four miscarriages might be preventable, researchers have said. Paying closer attention to avoidable risks, such as being underweight or obese before conception and drinking alcohol in pregnancy, could help reduce the toll, a study claims. Working nights and lifting heavy loads also increased the chance of miscarriage, as did being aged over 30, the Danish team said. They claimed that if women were able to cut these risk factors to very low levels, 25 per cent of miscarriages could be prevented. However, other scientists warned the study did not show that these factors cause miscarriages. Each year, a quarter of a million British women have a miscarriage. Most happen in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, but up to 10,000 occur at a later stage. Scientists from the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, looked at 91,427 pregnancies between 1996 and 2002, of which 3,177 ended in miscarriage before 22 weeks. At 16 weeks, women were asked about their lifestyle before conception and during pregnancy. Those who had already had a miscarriage were asked about their habits before it took place. The study found age, drinking alcohol, lifting more than 44lb (20kg), night shifts and being obese or overweight were all associated with miscarriage. Age and alcohol were the most significant factors, the report in BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology said. It added: ‘In a prevention scenario where women conceived at the age of 25 to 29 years, consumed no alcohol during pregnancy, were normal weight before pregnancy, did not lift more than 20kg daily during pregnancy, and worked only during the day, 25.2 per cent of miscarriages were preventable. It found drinking alcohol while pregnant, being underweight or obese were all 'avoidable risks'. Stock image . 'This scenario resulted in the highest preventable proportion of miscarriage.’ Sandra Feodor Nilsson, one of the researchers, said: ‘Miscarriage is the most common adverse pregnancy outcome, affecting at least one in seven pregnancies.’ Half of all miscarriages result from chance abnormalities in the baby’s chromosomes, which can cause the mother’s body to reject the fetus. Professor Tom Bourne, a consultant gynaecologist at London’s Queen Charlotte’s and Chelsea Hospital, said: ‘This is a big study, but it does not really say anything new. There are also issues of recall bias, and the fact that they show an association rather than causation. ‘Saying that by changing x or y a percentage of miscarriages could be prevented is quite a statement in the absence of an interventional trial. However, it adds to the view that alcohol in pregnancy is not a good idea.’ Patrick Wolfe, a professor of statistics at University College London, said: ‘This study does not establish a causal relationship between its reported risk factors and miscarriage. ‘The study has several statistical limitations, and so I caution that its conclusions may be subject to over-interpretation.’ He said it should not be seen as ‘the last word’ on the issue.","Scientists at the University of Copenhagen looked at 91,427 pregnancies .

Jeffrey LeVee of Jones Day, an attorney for ICANN, said that it had . reached a confidential settlement with Manwin to end the case. Manwin, run by 'King of Porn' Fabian Thylmann, sued over what it said were overly high prices for .xxx names.

ICANN, Manwin alleged, 'conspired to eliminate competition in the . markets for certain .xxx registry services, with the intent to injure . competition and consumers.' In court documents filed throughout the litigation, ICM and ICANN denied the allegations that they violated antitrust laws. Thylmann, 35, faces charges of avoiding paying tax on the Â£60million his online sex empire is said to earn each year.

With her clear skin, supermodel-long legs and slim figure, Faye Campbell looks like she knows how to look after herself. Such a physique, one assumes, must be down to a disciplined regime of exercise coupled with a restricted and controlled diet. And, yes, certainly, one of those points is true: Faye's diet is indeed restrictive, but not in the way you'd expect. Lunch is always tomato and cheese pizza or cheeseburger and chips, and dinner is, again, tomato and cheese pizza or cheeseburger and chips. And that is it. No fruit, vegetables, fresh meat or fish. Just processed, salty and fatty rubbish, day after day, all washed down with litres of sugar-packed Lucozade or cola. Very occasionally, she'll deviate and . have a Chinese takeaway of noodles with sweet and sour sauce, and she's . recently discovered a liking for breaded mozzarella sticks, but mostly . she sticks to tomato and cheese pizza or cheeseburgers and chips. When . her story broke in the Mail last month — in which Faye described . herself as a junk food addict — it led to the obvious question: what on . earth must she be doing to her health? Surely, as commentators pointed . out at the time, this ostensibly fit and strong body must be masking a . host of medical horrors within, which were fast catching up with her. This . was a question Faye — who, incidentally, does absolutely no exercise . and up until two months ago smoked up to 20 cigarettes a day — herself . had often pondered, with understandable trepidation. Only . after meeting Faye, and putting her through a raft of medical tests, is . the true conundrum of her size 10-12 figure revealed. I can confirm she . is a medical oddity. We . meet over lunch, where I observe Faye bolting down a double cheeseburger . (she specifies no salad or gherkins), large chips and a Coke at . McDonalds. I venture the obvious suggestion that Faye's terrible eating . habits must have started at home. She insists, vehemently, they didn't. 'The thing that upsets my mum the most . is when people assume this was how she raised me,' says Faye, who works . as a carer at a local residential home and still lives with parents . Carolyn, 43, an administrator, and father Mark, 45, a lorry driver. 'She hates me eating like this and she tried so hard to get me to eat healthily as a child.' Her . family — which includes sisters Lauren, 23, and Tilly, 19 — are very . close and Faye explains that sitting down to a home-cooked meal was . always a cornerstone of their family life. 'When we were at school we'd all sit together and talk about what we'd been doing and any problems we had.' Except . while the rest of her family enjoyed home-made casseroles and lasagnes, . Faye would refuse to eat anything but chips. Sometimes she'd even leave . the dining table to eat them in another room as she was unable to stand . the smell of her mother's home-cooked meals. It's enough to make most parents scoff with derision. Surely all that was needed here was a bit of discipline, but Faye insists she was not acting out of teenage faddiness or as an over-indulged brat, her problems were deep-rooted and had begun when she was a toddler. 'Mum couldn't get me to take anything but milk,' Faye says. 'That was all I'd want. She tried desperately to wean me onto meat and pasta and vegetables — she'd turn meals into funny faces, anything to tempt me — but I just refused. 'People would say I was just fussy, someone even advised her to lock me in my room, that I would eat when I was hungry, but nothing worked. And there were times I'd go two days without eating anything. That's when she'd get really worried. Junk food addict: Faye does absolutely no exercise and up until two months ago smoked up to 20 cigarettes a day . Over lunch, Faye bolts down a double cheeseburger (she specifies no salad or gherkins), large chips and a Coke at McDonalds . 'Finally, when I was about five Mum and Dad discovered I would eat chips. But then that's all I'd eat. 'One doctor warned that if I didn't start eating a more balanced diet I could be dead by 20.' Desperate to identify the root of the problem, Carolyn took Faye to a succession of doctors. The only diagnosis they could reach was that Faye was a picky eater. It wasn't until she was 15 that a new GP referred Faye to The Royal London Hospital at Whitechapel and tests revealed she suffered chronic gastro-oesophageal reflux. It's caused when the muscle at the bottom of the gullet stops working properly, allowing stomach acid to leak up the oesophagus into the mouth, causing an extreme burning sensation — heartburn — and an unpleasant taste. Long-term sufferers are at a slightly higher risk of developing cancer of the oesophagus. Often genetic, it runs in Faye's father's side of the family, but it had never been picked up in Faye. Doctors now think she had it from birth. Faye's condition was initially controlled with medication to inhibit acid production, but her relationship with food had been ruined . Since quitting smoking after her grandmother was diagnosed with lung cancer, Faye has put on more than a stone in weight . 'Every time I ate it hurt and my food didn't taste nice,' she says. 'It still happens now, but as a child I didn't understand. That's why I didn't want to eat anything, and why I was attracted to milk and chips.' Sufferers are often told to drink milk as it has a soothing effect because it coats the lining of the oesophagus. Some stodgy foods are thought to help minimise acid production. After diagnosis, Faye's condition was initially controlled with medication to inhibit acid production, but her relationship with food had been ruined. By now, it was a full-blown phobia she couldn't overcome. Just the smell of some food is enough to make her flee a room in revulsion and the thought of swallowing anything 'unsafe' sends her into a panic. Yet she did persevere: after counselling Faye finally moved on from milk and chips and ate her first pizza at 15 — her parents were delighted — then her first burger two years later. Health concerns: Faye Campbell with her grandmother Brenda . Further progress remains very, very slow: it takes her years to pluck up the courage to try new things. It's not a disorder that attracts instant sympathy. Strangers can be downright rude about her eating habits, particularly when they see her figure. And she used to be much slimmer than she is today. Since quitting smoking after her grandmother was diagnosed with lung cancer, Faye has put on more than a stone in weight. Yet at 5ft 9ins, she weights 11st 4lbs and is still enviably slim. 'I get a lot of criticism about my diet from strangers,' admits Faye. 'People tell me I'm going to die young if I keep eating like this, that I must be really unhealthy and that I'm going to look old before my time. 'And I know it makes Mum sad that she can't cook for me. She's always really happy when I try something new. She's always coming home from the supermarket with new things to tempt me. 'Recently it was sticks of mozzarella covered with breadcrumbs and she was delighted that I liked them. 'She occasionally gets me to take a multivitamin tablet, but still worries about the impact of my diet on my health.' And it's not just her health which suffers. Faye, who is single, concedes her love life has been affected. 'When I'm asked out I explain that all I eat are pizzas, burgers and chips. It means I don't ever get to go for romantic meals, though I joke that at least I'm a cheap date.' And come Christmas Day she won't be enjoying a festive dinner with the rest of the family. Unable to bear the smell of cooked sprouts and roast meat, she'll be in the next room with Chinese noodles and sweet and sour sauce. 'I'd love to be able enjoy a family meal just once,' she says wistfully. www.bmihealthcare.co.uk/health-screening .","Faye Campbell looks like she knows how to look after herself .

"By . Ashley Collman . PUBLISHED: . 23:07 EST, 17 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 12:57 EST, 18 February 2014 . Watch your back, Meier! American NHL referee Brad Meier is now despised in Russia for ruling a goal in Team USA's favor during Saturday's game against the home team . Angry Russians today gathered at the American Embassy in Moscow to make apparent death threats against the US hockey referee who they blame for their country’s thrilling hockey loss to the states at the weekend. Although the fans insist the threats to boil Brad Meir and render his flesh into soap are light-hearted, it reflects growing anger in the country at the decision to have an American referee adjudicate the crucial match. Russian coach Zinetula Bilyaletdinov believes the game would have ended differently if Meier hadn't disallowed a Russian goal late in the game that would have put them in the lead. 'The referee made a mistake of course, it would have been more effective to have a different judge,' Bilyaletdinov said. The score was 2-2 when a Russian player Fedor Tyutin hit the puck into the goal, but the score came into contention when American goaltender Jonathan Quick pointed out that the net was off its base. After reviewing footage, Meier and Swedish referee Marcus Vinnerborg agreed that the net was off its base before the score and the goal couldn't be counted. The crowd of more than 11,000 at Bolshoi Ice Dome, populated with home country fans including President Vladimir Putin, erupted in anger at the call. 'It was definitely a goal,' Russian player Alex Ovechkin said. 'The goalie touched the net so the net moved. The referee had to see it. [Meier] should have given [Quick] two minutes.' Asked whether more neutral referees should be chosen for the Olympics, Bilyaletdinov said: 'We don't appoint the referees, a board of referees appoints them, so we can only take the situation as a given.' The U.S. went on to win the match thanks to T.J. Oshie scoring four times in the shootout. Jumping the gun: Russia celebrates a goal in the third period, but the score was eventually disallowed because the net was displaced . Advance: The U.S. team went on to win the match against Russia 3-2 and will compete in the quarterfinals in two days . Still in the running: The Russians are still in the tournament but will have to fight it out with Finland to stay in medal contention in a match tomorrow . The International Ice Hockey Federation later defended Meier's decision saying the rulings made by the two referees 'was the correct call and that the proper procedure had been followed with regards to the video review'. That hasn't stopped Russians from voicing their anger online and in public protests in Moscow. Many Russians fans have posted pictures of Meier on Twitter, with comments like 'Remember the face of the a**h***' and 'We will not forget this face'. The threats were more direct in Moscow on Monday when Russians fans gathered outside the American Embassy to protest Meier's call. Demonstration: Russian fans even went so far to protest Meier outside the American embassy in Moscow after Saturday's game . Some of the fans participated in a Russian sports tradition of shredding soap, which is meant to symbolize killing someone and rendering their fat to make soap. The other interpretation is the soap used on a noose in a hanging. While that sounds like a death threat, the fans insist it is light-hearted. 'Please don't take it as a death threat,' Dmitry Chesnokov, writer for Puck Daddy, told Yahoo Sports. The Russians have not yet been knocked out of the tournament. They are scheduled to go up against Finland Tuesday and team USA will compete in the quarterfinals the day after.","Brad Meier disallowed a goal that would have but the Russian team in the lead .

A new law requiring motorists to remove snow and ice from their vehicles has become a new source of revenue for Connecticut. State police are aggressively ticketing drivers who ignore the so-called 'ice missile' law.Since the law took effect Jan. 1, state police have issued at least 230 tickets to truckers and motorists who were driving snow-covered vehicles. At $120 per summons that amounts to $27,600 in tickets in a month and a half. The fine is $75, plus $45 in various surcharges. Cracked: State police said they've been going after drivers who fail to clear the snow off of vehicle roofs. This is part of the state's 'ice missile' law that went into effect at the beginning of the year . Targets: Connecticut State police said they've been going after drivers who fail to clear the snow off of vehicle roofs . With 12 significant snowstorms already this winter, motorists are getting plenty of practice removing snow. The job is often complicated by freezing rain and low temperatures. Mike Riley, president of the Motor Transport Association of Connecticut, which represents 900 companies with truck drivers, said it's hard enough to remove frozen snow and ice from a car. Trucks, with high cabs and thin trailer roofs, are even more difficult, he said. 'We don't have a good solution to this,' he said. On the lookout: State troopers in Connecticut and New Jersey both say they¿ve written hundreds of tickets this winter season enforcing laws in each state requiring drivers to clear off their snow-covered vehicles before hitting the roads and highways . Pricey mistake: Connecticut¿s law took effect Jan. 1, and troopers say they¿ve already issued more than 230 summonses to drivers, with fines topping $27,000. The fine for each offense is $75, . Some companies have made available large swinging brushes to push snow off. Trucking companies have sold 200 roof rakes intended for trucks, Riley said. 'That seems to be a temporary low-tech solution,' he said. 'It's almost impossible to get all of it off, and people should not be penalized for a small amount.' The law was passed in 2010 but was delayed to Jan. 1, 2014, to allow the public to become aware of the regulation and for trucking companies to develop ways to remove snow. Chunks of snow and ice flying off vehicles can pose a safety hazard. The fine for the infraction is $75. If snow damages a car or causes a crash, the driver could face a $200 . fine. For commercial drivers, it's even higher at $500. Digging out: New Jersey enacted a similar law in 2010, and troopers say they¿ve written hundreds of tickets this winter season. Drivers who fail to clear off their vehicles in the Garden State face fines between $25 an $75 .

King, the firm behind hit mobile phone game Candy Crush Saga, is planning a U.S. stock market debut which some analysts think could value it at more than $5 billion  - and lead to a flurry of technology company listings this year. The game, which involves moving candies to make a line of three in the same color, was the most downloaded free app of 2013, and the year's top revenue-grossing app. King, the Swedish firm behind hit mobile phone game Candy Crush Saga, is planning a U.S. stock market debut . The firm has more than 180 titles in 14 languages. The most popular include Candy Crush Saga, Farm Heroes Saga, Papa Pear Saga, Pet Rescue Saga and Bubble Witch Saga. The biggest hit by far is Candy Crush Saga, has been downloaded more than 500 million times since its launch in 2012. Overall the firm has over 324 million average monthly unique users, as of December 31, 2013, across web, social and mobile platforms. It has been downloaded more than 500 million times since its launch in 2012. The basic games are free, but players need to pay for add-ons or extra lives. The successful flotation of Twitter in November and a surge in Facebook shares have fueled speculation that a string of technology firms could come to market, including Spotify, AirBnB and Square, as well as King. But some analysts question whether King can keep up its breakneck pace of growth, particularly given the difficulty some other games makers have experienced in maintaining success. Zynga, the maker of Farmville, has seen its share price halve since its late 2011 initial public offering (IPO), while Finland's Rovio has struggled to replicate the success of its 2010 hit Angry Birds. 'It's (Candy Crush Saga) a hot game and King is a fast-growing company, but obviously you have precedents for these type of companies that have been affected by the boom and bust cycles of the game market,' said Josef Schuster, founder of IPOX Schuster, a Chicago-based IPO research and investment house. The IPO prospectus offered a first glimpse into King's money-making machine, which generated $1.9 billion in revenues in 2013, or $5 million a day. It posted adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $825 million in the year, up from $28.5 million in 2012. By comparison, Zynga and Supercell, the company behind Clash of Clans, both earned around $900 million in revenues last year. The game's success has been described as 'staggering' ""Candy Crush Saga,"" the maddeningly addictive mobile game that involves matching bright-hued virtual candies in a row to have them disappear, only to be replaced by more. Adam Krejcik, an analyst at Eilers Research in California, said the results in King's U.S. filing were 'staggering', but noted a slowdown in quarterly revenues at the end of 2013. 'Have we seen peak revenue and bookings for King, or can they make up for declines with other games?' he questioned. King co-founder and CEO Riccardo Zacconi said the group, which is 48.2 percent-owned by private equity firm Apax Partners, had so far launched five games for mobile phones and all had attracted substantial fan-bases. 'Mobile usage is exploding and games are commanding the lion's share of time spent,"" he said in the prospectus. 'Consumption habits have changed - mobile has meant that people consume more digital content than they ever have before, and they want to be entertained over short periods of time whenever and wherever they are.' Japanese tech and telecoms group Softbank bought 51 percent of Supercell late last year, valuing the firm at $3 billion, or around 6.5 times its 2013 EBITDA. Applying the same multiple to King's 2013 EBITDA would value the firm at around $5.3 billion. 'The risk here is that the company is valued beyond the $7-$10 billion range because it is a hot company,' Schuster said. 'On the first or the second day of trading the company is going to be an expensive buy and if the stock does well in the first month or so there is no room for upside.' King, which plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""KING"", intends to raise up to $500 million in the listing, but the amount a company says it plans to raise in its first IPO filings is used to calculate registration fees and the final size of the IPO could be different. Founded in Sweden in 2003, King was profitable in 2005 and has not had a funding round since September of that year, when it raised 34 million euros ($46 million) from Apax and Index Ventures. In the last few months, it has made more than $500 million in dividend payments - including a $217 million payout this month - to its board of directors, its top executives and major investors. Index Ventures owns 8.3 percent of King.","Game was the most downloaded free app of 2013 .

Charges: Pregnant teen Megan Grunwald is facing first-degree murder charges after her 27-year-old boyfriend shot dead a police officer in Utah last month, and she tried to help him flee . Prosecutors say a 17-year-old girl was pregnant and high on meth when she and her boyfriend shot and killed a sheriff's deputy who was just trying to help them with car trouble on the side of a Utah road last month. Deputy Cory Wride was sitting in his patrol car when Megan Dakota Grunwald's 27-year-old boyfriend Jose Angel Garcia-Juaregui opened the rear window of their truck and shot him dead on January 30. That murder set off a hours-long car chase across Utah that eventually ended in officers shooting Garcia-Juaregui in the head, and he died the following day. But Grunwald survived, and now she's being tried as an adult for a dozen felonies and two misdemeanors related to Wride's death and the ensuing car chase - though she never pulled a trigger. Documents filed in court shed light on the dramatic crime spree that ended in death on I-15 roadway last month. Wride stopped to help Grunwald and her boyfriend around 1pm because he thought they were having car trouble and wanted to help. Grunwald was driving the car with her boyfriend in the passenger's seat. She gave Wride her driver's license but Garcia-Juearegui gave the officer a false name. Wride went back and forth between the pick-up truck registered to Grunwald's mother and his squad car three times, trying to figure out Garcia-Juaregui's actual identity. Unprovoked: Utah County Sheriff's Deputy Cory Wride was shot dead by Grunwald's boyfriend after trying to help the couple he thought was having car troubles . Crime couple: The chase ended when sheriff's deputies shot Jose Angel Garcia-Juaregui (left) in the head and his girlfriend Grunwald (right)  was arrested. Garcia-Juaregui died the following day in the hospital . Mourning: Family, friends and fellow police officers attend the funeral of Cory Wride in Spanish Ford Cemetery on February 5 . Tragic loss: Wride's wife Nanette (right) is comforted by her son Shea at the funeral . It was while sitting in his squad car that Garcia-Juaregui opened the rear window of the truck's cab and started shooting at the officer and his girlfriend sped off. Wride died and his body wasn't found until 45 minutes later when another deputy was sent out to check up on him. Fellow deputy Greg Sherwood tracked the couple's truck down around 3pm and attempted to pull the couple over. But Grunwald wouldn't stop, and actually 'aggresively applied the brakes' to shorten the distance between the two vehicles while her boyfriend started shooting. Garcia-Juregui hit Sherwood in the head, critically injuring the officer. Sherwood eventually recovered from the injury and returned home Tuesday after spending 19 days in the hospital. Attempted murder: Garcia-Juaregui also shot at Deputy Greg Sherwood (pictured with wife Gina above), and critically injured the officer . Recovery: Sherwood spent 19 days in hospital but was finally allowed to go home on Tuesday . After hitting Sherwood, the couple hit another roadblock when their truck crashed after hitting spikes laid on the road near Nephi, Utah. Instead of surrendering to police, Grunwald helped flagged down a minivan and her boyfriend carjacked the vehicle from a woman who was on her way home from a parent-teacher conference. This is just one of the instances prosecutors are using to argue that Grunwald was not being forced by her boyfriend to take part in the crime spree. After abandoning the truck, prosecutors say Grunwald 'on her own accord, follows Mr Garcia-Juaregui after leaving the vehicle without appearing to be coerced by him'. The couple didn't get far with the hijacked car and crashed again on a second strip of spikes. After hitting the spikes, police say Grunwald crossed into traffic and tried to strike another vehicle on purpose. End of the road: The hours-long chase finally came to an end when the couple's hijacked car hit a second set of spikes and they crashed . Juab County sheriff's deputies were finally able to stop the couple when they shot Garcia-Juaregui in the head. Justice: Grunwald has her first hearing scheduled for next Monday.

Kate Middleton's trademark chestnut curls usually give the impression that she has stepped straight out of the salon after hours of styling. But according to Scots stylist Denise McAdam - who cut the hair of the Royal Family for more than three decades - the Duchess of Cambridge’s style is, though wonderful, ‘maybe a little overdone'. Looking back on her years tending to the locks of royal women, the veteran hairdresser described Princess Anne as ‘scary’ and said the Duchess of York has had her ‘fair share of disasters’. Style: Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge - pictured in April 2011 (left) and November 2012 (right)- has hair that is 'a little overdone' on occasion, according to the royal hairdresser . She told the Radio Times: ‘I don’t do the royals any more, although I’m a good friend of the Duchess of Cambridge. I think her hair is wonderful, maybe a little overdone at times. But she always looks lovely.’ Miss McAdam, from Edinburgh, was awarded the Royal Victorian Medal for her services to the royals in 2010. She said the medal was ‘for 35 years of keeping my mouth shut’. But now the 55-year-old hairdresser has . left their employment, she clearly felt able to throw some of that . discretion to the wind. 'I'm a good friend of the Duchess of Cambridge. I think her hair is wonderful, maybe a little overdone at times. But she always looks lovely' Denise McAdam . Reflecting on the Queen’s daughter, she said: ‘I ended up dedicating most of my career to royal women and their hair. Princess Anne was the scary one, particularly when I was young. ‘It was a simple up-do, so I just used to go in, close my eyes and do it as quickly as possible. Sarah Ferguson, on the other hand, is a great friend.’ The stylist claimed she helped the Duchess acclimatise to life with the royals before she married Prince Andrew in 1986.

She will be joined by celebrity stylist Alain Pichon, who has worked with such global A-listers as pop superstar Kylie Minogue, supermodel Claudia Schiffer and former England footballer David Beckham. The Frenchman revealed he has a ‘strategy’ when cutting Beckham’s hair because the 38-year-old’s style is so important to him. He said: ‘I never go against his wishes. Saying that, a few years ago he wanted to keep his hair long, but I told him to cut it short. ‘Then he tried to grow it again and I said, “This isn’t happening. We’ll end up with another ponytail and we’ve done that”…we worked something out.’ He added: ‘Madonna has the best hair of anyone I’ve ever worked with.

Harry Potter author JK Rowling is set to release her second crime novel under the pen name of Robert Galbraith. The book, called Silkworm, will be released on June 19th, according to publishers, and will be a sequel of the number one bestseller The Cuckoo's Calling. Her latest work will again feature private detective Cormoran Strike, a war veteran who is hired to investigate a supermodel's supposed suicide. Crime novel: The book will be the second the 48-year-old author has written under the name Robert Galbraith . It will see Strike and his assistant, Robin Ellacott, unravelling the death of writer Owen Quine after they are asked to investigate his disappearance. The pair then uncover a damning manuscript with the details of a number of Quine's associates, who are described in a negative way. The publisher describes it as 'a compulsively readable crime novel with twists at every turn'. Popular: The Cuckoo's Calling became an international best seller last year after the author's true identity was revealed . The new description reads: 'At first, Mrs Quine just thinks her husband has gone off by himself for a few days – as he has done before – and she wants Strike to find him and bring him home. 'But as Strike investigates, it becomes clear that there is more to Quine's disappearance than his wife realises. 'The novelist has just completed a manuscript featuring poisonous pen-portraits of almost everyone he knows. 'If the novel were to be published, it would ruin lives – meaning that there are a lot of people who might want him silenced. 'When Quine is found brutally murdered under bizarre circumstances, it becomes a race against time to understand the motivation of a ruthless killer.' The 48-year-old had aimed to keep her crime writing venture a secret, but the pseudonym was made public by a solicitor. The lawyer has since been fined and the author was paid damages, which she gave to charity. At the time, she said: 'I had hoped to keep this secret a little longer. It has been wonderful to publish without hype or expectation, and pure pleasure to get feedback under a different name.' It is Rowling's third novel for adults, the first being Casual Vacancy, which was released in 2012.

A new reality dating show is in the works that claims to 'take one man and woman and strip them of all their . pretenses.' In addition to the pretenses, the show also strips each contestant of their clothes - the gimmick for the show, which has the working title of Naked Dating, is that each person appears in the buff for their rendezvous with their potential suitor. The idea for the show comes from Lighthearted Entertainment, which is the company behind other hit reality shows like Extreme Makeover, The Moment of Truth, Next, 72 Hours and Are You the One. Nude: VH1's new reality dating show features naked contestants trying to win the heart of potential mates - and they do it completely naked . The show will feature one man and one woman as they date two potential suitors - each of whom is naked. According to the Hollywood Reporter, 'the series will explore the art of romance - free of preconceived notions, stereotypes and, yes, clothing.' At the end of each episode, the two contestants 'will analyze what they've learned from their dates - and themselves - before deciding whether to move forward with their potential love interests.' The show's host - who is yet to be named - will oversee the contestants and their dates, and the series will be filmed in an 'exotic locale.' The show will appear on VH1 and has been green-lighted for 10 episodes. According to VH1, the show will be edited to meet network standards. 'At first, this seems like a show that’s all about a . noisy, provocative hook -- and we embrace that,' Susan Levison, executive . vp original programming and production at VH1, told THR. 'But when you go deeper, it’s . really about something that we can all relate to -- the search for true love. It’s also a series with heart and masterful storytelling -- both earmarks of an . engaging, must-watch show.' Love: VH1 Vice President Susan Levison says the show is 'about something that we can all relate to -- the search for true love' Preconceptions: Other shows have tried to eliminate preconceived notions based on appearance in reality dating . Other networks have dabbled in the nude reality show genre - last year, Discovery attempted two naked reality shows, Naked Castaway and Naked and Affraid. SyFy 'explores the business and art of body painting' in Naked Vegas, and TLC is home to Buying Naked, a real estate show about a nudist couple looking for a 'clothing optional' home. ABC entertained a reality dating show four years ago that had a similar theme. Dating in the Dark featured six contestants who get to know each other in a dark room where they can't see each other. Like Naked Dating, the idea is to prevent preconceived ideas based on physical appearance. 'We created this show based on marrying a provocative . idea with a back to basics philosophy. With all the dating options in the . world, what happens if you take one man and woman and strip them of all their . pretenses?' Lighthearted Entertainment President Howard Schultz told the publication. 'VH1 immediately understood our vision and . is a fantastic partner on a show that uses a social experiment to provide a fun . and entertaining look into how men and women interact when they bare all.'

Hosted in a darkened Shoreditch warehouse and set to the thumping roar of a live, heavy metal duo, Giles Deacon's AW14 collection was always going to be quite left-of-centre. The entire front row was decked out in Wool And the Gang beanies that had been provided in their goodie bags, and before the action kicked off there were hushed whispers as to whether Kim Kardashian's half-sister Kendall Jenner was modelling or not. Strobe lights welcomed A-list models, who stomped down the runway in a flurry of oranges, cobalt blues and greys. In fact, the modelling collective was more star-studded than the front row, featuring the likes of Jourdan Dunn, Cara Delevingne and - the rumours were true - Keeping Up with the Kardashians star Kendall Jenner. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Me and my girls: Jourdan Dunn, left, wearing a machine washable-tunic, with Cara Delevingne, centre, and Giles Deacon, back . Of course, all eyes remained on Cara who, in a catwalk first, documented her appearance in a video selfie on her phone for the entire duration of the model finale, before posting it on Instagram. The collection itself proved more extrordinary than many others seen on the runway, as Giles included two entirely machine-washable pieces. Working with P&G Fabric Care, Giles started his machine-washable revolution last Autumn, showcasing seven such dresses in Milan, saying that he wants to change the landscape of clothing care. 'My role with P&G Fabric Care is to challenge the pre-conceived ideas of what can be put inside a washing machine, and that means creating designs using future fabrics which can take centre stage on the runway and be cared for once they are inside a wardrobe.' Giles Deacon added that he hasn't had to let his design quality slip in order to make the clothes machine-washable. Star studded catwalk: Cara Delevigne, left, and Kardashian star Kendall Jenner, right . He continued: 'Since starting as P&G's global fashion consultant I . have had my eyes opened to the future of fabric care and wash . technology, I have worked with specific mills who have enabled the process to . retain the essential ""Giles"" elements without compromising at all.' You'd be hard-pressed to guess which items in the collection were machine-washable, but one piece included a tunic worn by Jourdan Dunn. Highlights of the collection included a humming bird-print dress (that also came in a machine-washable version) oversized orange knits, and one particular little black dress that was embellished with hundreds of black and white beetles. It's us! Cara Delevigne recorded the models' finale walk in a video selfie from the runway . And these were pieces of which the designer himself was pretty fond, with Giles having remarked: 'My favourite pieces are the . kingfisher print and embroideries and the lilly bug dresses'. Despite having some of the most influential and charismatic models gracing his catwalk, Giles never has a particular muse in mind when designing his collections. 'I never have one specific muse, I much prefer the idea of . lots of different fantastic characters and characteristics. From a visual . perspective, I was interested in the melancholy of nature viewed through a . technological mindset.' Keeping up with a Kardashian: Kendall Jenner backstage at last night's Giles show . Front row ladies: Daisy Lowe, left, and Gwendoline Christie, right, were guests on the Giles front row . But Giles does have a good idea of what sort of woman might wear his clothes. 'The Giles girl is one who enjoys fashion and is partial to some accessible flamboyance and eccentricity,' he said. There was certainly a feel of flamboyancy in the room, with strobe lighting and on-catwalk selfies. Even the finale differed from its competitors, with Giles sending models down in groups of three rather than in a continual line. Cara's trio was the one captured in her three-way video selfie. Made In Chelsea's Rosie Fortescue, who sat in the front row, said of the show: 'It had a great vibe but it was also very wearable.'","Giles' collection included two machine-washable pieces .

To many New Yorker's satisfaction, one Supreme Court justice thinks that while Chicago deep dish is 'very tasty,' it doesn't count as pizza. Antonin Scalia spoke to an audience at the Union League Club in Chicago for George Washington's birthday and gave his opinion on the New York pizza versus the Chicago pizza controversy. US Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia thinks deep dish pizza should be called 'tomato pie' Scalia believes real pizza like New York pizza (left) has a thin crust while Chicago pizza (right) has a thick crust and should be called 'tomato pie' The International Business Times reports that this isn't the first time Scalia has spoken out about his favoritism for New York pizza. In 2011, Scalia argued that thin-crust New York pizza is 'infinitely better' than deep dish. He spoke with students at the Chicago Kent School of law and told them, 'I do indeed like so-called ""deep dish pizza""... It’s very tasty...But it should not be called pizza It should be called 'a tomato pie.' Real pizza is Neapolitan. It is thin. It is chewy and crispy, OK?' Even though Scalia's opinion on the pizza is not an official ruling, Scalia has some background experience in the matter. The New York Post reports that Scalia was born in New Jersey then grew up in Elmhurst, Queens where he was raised eating New York pizza. Pizza originates in Italy, and since Scalia is the son of an Italian immigrant it make sense that he has an opinion about the popular dish, . Scalia is one of the more conservative Supreme Court justices and is known for being a textualist, someone who relies very heavily on what the constitution says instead of what makes the most sense for the common law of the time period. Even though many believe that thin crust pizza evolved over time into its Chicago deep dish counter part, Scalia stands by his original belief that , 'Real pizza is Neapolitan. It is thin.

It is used to broadcast happiness, express sadness and vent frustration. So it is perhaps no surprise that Twitter could help spot post-natal depression. Microsoft scientists have identified changes in use of the site that suggest a woman is at risk of crippling mood changes after her baby is born. The information could be used to treat women sooner or simply to ensure they have the help and practical support they need after the birth. Baby blues: Microsoft scientists have identified changes in use of the site that suggest a woman is at risk of crippling mood changes, indicative of post-natal depression, after her baby is born . In future, it may be possible to create an app – a computer programme that can be run on a smartphone – to provide early warning and dispense advice. Around one in seven new mothers suffers from post-natal depression but the stigma surrounding the condition leaves many afraid to seek help. Eric Horvitz, head of Microsoft Research’s biggest lab, hopes that by making diagnosis easier, more new mothers will get the attention they need. However, there are likely to concerns about privacy, particularly when dealing with the sensitive area of public health. Dr Horvitz began by scanning archives of Twitter messages –  ‘tweets’ of up to 140 characters posted publically on the internet - for words and phrases related to the announcement of a birth. When he was satisfied he had identified several hundred new mothers, he began to analyse the their messages from the three months before and after having their baby. He looked for changes in the amount of time the women spent on Twitter, the people they were in touch with and the language used. For instance, an increase in the use of ‘I’ suggests someone is becoming more introspective and self-focused and has been linked to the onset of depression. Pattern: Dr Eric Horvitz, head of one of Microsoft Research's biggest labs analysed tweets from new mothers. He then created software that scoured pre-birth tweets to predict with of over 70 per cent accuracy if a woman¿s Twitter messages would show signs of depression after having her baby .

"By . James  Nye . PUBLISHED: . 14:46 EST, 18 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 14:56 EST, 18 February 2014 . Miami Dolphins offensive lineman Richie Incognito has returned to Twitter to apologize to teammate Jonathan Martin, NFL independent investigator Ted Wells and owner Stephen Ross after comments he made last week on the social network. Late on Monday evening into early Tuesday morning, Incognito said that he would like to 'apologize for acting like a big baby the last few days' and claimed that 'This has all been so much on me and my family. I just want to play football.' The u-turn came after the release last Friday of the report into the high-profile bullying of Martin last season which named him as a bullying ringleader, which prompted Incognito to declare on Twitter that he could not be defined 'in 144 years let alone 144 pages'. Twitter apologies: Miami Dolphins Richie Incognito (68) and Jonathan Martin (71) have been at the center of a shocking allegations of bullying and abuse inside the NFl team's locker room. On Monday and Tuesday - Incognito retracted comments he had made in the aftermath of a report into the alleged abuse . He also questioned the impartiality of the investigation by and claimed it could not be independent 'when the NFL paid the person to do it'. Incognito had left Twitter the day the report was published, stating 'Goodbye Twitter. Be well...see you on the other side.' Indeed, before the report was released, Incognito had fired off an attack on Martin via Twitter, claiming the 'truth is going to bury you and your entire camp. You could have told the truth the entire time'. However, on publication of the report, Incognito and two teammates were accused of a 'pattern of harassment' aimed at Martin and other young players inside the Dolphin's locker room. In an abrupt change of tact towards Martin, the Dolphin's lineman said, 'I would like to send Jonathan my apologies as well. Until someone tells me different you are still my brother. No hard feelings.' Sorry: These are some of the stream of tweets that Richie Incognito sent out on Monday and Tuesday evening to apologize for his angry rant following the publication of Ted Wells' report into bullying at the Miami Dolphins on Friday . And most importantly, Incognito said sorry to Ross and Wells to wrap up his Twitter apologies. Ted Wells is the New York attorney hired by NFL commissioner Roger Goodell to investigate the staggering claims of abuse from within the Dolphins locker room. Claiming that 's**t got cray cray', Incognito attempted to repair the damage with his paymaster and investigator. Justifying his previous ill-tempered rant, Incognito claimed 'There are no winners in the courts. Just families left to deal with their decisions and pick up the pieces. You can't free something. We're all born free.' Indeed, with his career hanging in the balance, Incognito seems unwilling to let go of the fact that he feels wronged in the whole debacle. Thanks boss and sorry: Richie Incognito said sorry to Ted Wells and his owner Stephen Ross for accusing the investigation into him of lacking authenticity and thanked Ross for his continuing employment . He retweeted one comment to him from a fan that read, 'Keep your head up brother. There are always 3 sides of a story. His side. Your side and the truth.' Last week, the investigation into the racially charged Miami Dolphins bullying scandal detailed widespread harassment in the team's locker room that extended beyond the two players at the centre of the probe. The NFL-ordered report stated there was a 'pattern of harassment' committed by at least three players and extended to two lineman and an assistant trainer, all targets of vicious taunts and racist insults. Lawyer Ted Wells released the report, saying guard John Jerry and center Mike Pouncey followed Richie Incognito's lead in harassing Jonathan Martin, who left the team in October. They threatened to rape his sister, called him a long list of slurs and bullied him for not being 'black enough'. Defiant: On Friday Incognito let rip into the report which labelled him one of the chief instigators in a bullying culture within the Miami Dolphin's locker room . Debatable: Incognito also questioned whether the report was impartial as it had been commissioned by the NFL and not an outside adjudicator . In a statement emailed by a league spokesman, the NFL did not make any mention of possible punishment stemming from the case. The league only confirmed it had received the report and said it appreciated the Dolphins' cooperation with the investigation. Wells said he does not intend to comment further. Martin is biracial, Incognito is white, and Jerry and Pouncey are black. Martin's agent Kenneth Zuckerman said his client feels 'vindicated' by the report. 'He feels a great sense of relief,' Zuckerman told The Associated Press. 'Jonathan Martin is a great man and he's only shown me that he is very honest since the day I met him. He loves football and is eager to get back on the field, regardless of what team he plays for.' Incognito's attorney, Mark Schamel, released a statement calling Wells' report 'replete with errors' and said that Martin 'was never bullied by Richie Incognito or any member of the Dolphins' offensive line.' Annoyed: In one of his outbursts over the weekend, Incognito attacked his agent Joe Panos . Incognito sent a tweet Friday night, saying: 'You could not define me in 144 years let alone 144 pages Mr Wells. Thank you for your hard work and dedication.' Martin, who has two years left on his contract with the Dolphins, declined interview requests.Incognito was suspended in November, but Pouncey and Jerry remained starters throughout the season. The report mentioned another offensive lineman and an assistant trainer who also routinely came under attack from the trio. Neither was identified in the report. The report chronicled Martin's struggle to deal with a 'pattern of harassment', including emotional text exchanges with his parents and a description of him crying in the bathroom after one particularly painful attack. Martin also told investigators that he 'believed that trying to engage in a physical confrontation with these three - whom he viewed as a united group - would only make matters worse.' The inquiry said Martin was taunted and ridiculed almost daily. After Martin left the team, Incognito boasted about 'breaking Jmart' in a notebook the linemen used to tally fines and bonuses among themselves. When the investigation began, Incognito asked another player to destroy the book, saying: 'They're going to suspend me.' 'Bully': Offensive lineman John Jerry also is accused of harassing Martin and others in the Miami Dolphins organization . Harassment: Mike Pouncey (pictured), Richie Incognito and John Jerry engaged in a 'pattern of harassment' against Martin and others . The other harassed player was 'subjected to homophobic name-calling and improper physical touching,' while the assistant trainer, who was born in Japan, was subjected to racial slurs. 'It was not difficult to conclude that the Assistant Trainer and Player A were harassed, but the questions raised in Martin's case were more complex, nuanced and difficult,' the report says. Although Wells concluded that Martin was abused by three teammates, the report said 'they did not intend to drive Martin from the team or cause him lasting emotional injury.' Evaluating Martin's claims was difficult, 'given his mental health issues, his possible heightened sensitivity to insults and his unusual, ""bipolar"" friendship with Incognito,' the report said. 'Nonetheless, we ultimately concluded that Martin was indeed harassed by Incognito, who can fairly be described as the main instigator.' The report comes about three months after the league hired Wells to investigate the case, which prompted a national debate about hazing and workplace bullying. 'To a great extent, Incognito dictated the culture,' the report said. 'We doubt that matters would have gotten so out of hand had Incognito not set a tone on the offensive line that made extremely vulgar taunting a typical form of communication.' Dolphins offensive line coach Jim Turner didn't attempt to stop the behavior and even took part in some of the taunting of 'Player A', the report said. Several people interviewed told investigators that Turner gave Player A, a male sex doll as a gag gift around Christmas 2012. Turner told investigators he did not remember the incident, but investigators said they did not believe him. Investigation: NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell ordered an investigation of the Dolphins after Martin quit the team in October . Investigation: Attorney Ted Wells was hired by the NFL to conduct an independent investigation into the Miami Dolphins . However, the report found no evidence that the Dolphins front office or head coach Joe Philbin was aware of the conduct Martin found abusive. The 6-foot-5, 312-pound Martin abruptly left the team on October 28. He was briefly hospitalized and then joined his family in California and underwent counseling for emotional issues. Incognito was barred from the season's last eight games. Incognito expressed regrets about the racist and profane language he used with Martin, but said it stemmed from a culture of locker-room 'brotherhood', not bullying. Martin has said he tried to be friends with Incognito. The two players traded more than a thousand text messages in a year's span, and the teasing and vulgar banter went both ways. Martin also participated in the teasing of Player A, although investigators say he was simply trying to fit in with the other linemen. The report also mentioned Martin having suicidal thoughts. 'Whether or not Incognito, Jerry and Pouncey fully appreciated the effect of their actions on Martin, there is no doubt that, from Martin's perspective, their actions were abusive and hurtful,' the report said. 'We are not, however, in a position to evaluate Martin's assertion that the abusive conduct of his teammates was, in fact, the exclusive triggering cause of his depression and contemplation of suicide.' The NFL Players Association said it will review the findings closely, confer with players and all relevant parties involved. Dolphins owner Stephen Ross said in a statement: 'As an organization, we are committed to a culture of team-first accountability and respect for one another.'","Miami Dolphin's Richie Incognito returned to Twitter to offer apologies all round on Monday night .

A mother upset about 'indecent' T-shirts on display at a Utah mall found a quick if not especially convenient way to remove them: She bought every last one. Judy Cox and her 18-year-old son were shopping on Saturday at the University Mall in Orem, about 40 miles south of Salt Lake City, when she saw the shirts in the window of a PacSun store. The shirts featured pictures of scantily dressed models in provocative poses. Judy Cox sits for a portrait next to a stack of T-shirts with what she believes are pornographic designs . PacSun said its T-shirts were aimed at young adults and high school aged students, not young children . Cox said she complained about the window display to a store manager and was told the T-shirts couldn't be taken down without approval from the corporate office. She then bought all 19 T-shirts in stock, for a total of $567. She says she plans to return them later, toward the end of the chain store's 60-day return period. The shirts cost about $28 each on the website for PacSun, which sells beach clothes for teenagers and young adults. 'These shirts clearly cross a boundary that is continually being pushed on our children in images on the Internet, television and when our families shop in the mall,' Cox said in an email to The Associated Press. The story was first reported by The Daily Herald of Provo. An employee at the Orem store said on Tuesday she wasn't authorized to speak about the issue and referred questions to the company's Orange County, Calif., corporate headquarters. PacSun CEO Gary Schoenfeld said in an emailed statement the company takes pride in the clothes and products it sells, which are inspired by music, art, fashion and action sports. 'While customer feedback is important to us, we remain committed to the selection of brands and apparel available in our stores,' Schoenfeld said in the statement. Orem is a city of about 90,000 in ultraconservative Utah County that uses the motto 'Family City USA.' Most residents belong to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which frowns on pornography and encourages its youth to dress and act modestly. Judy Cox bought all the t-shirts from the PacSun store for $567 . Cox met with Orem city attorney Greg Stephens on Tuesday to discuss whether the images on the T-shirts violated city code. Stephens said he told Cox that she first needed to file a complaint with police. He said police would then review the issue and decide whether it needed to be passed on to the city attorney, a process that could take weeks. City code prohibits anyone from putting 'explicit sexual material' on public display. The city defines that as 'any material that appeals to a prurient interest in sex and depicts nudity, actual or simulated sexual conduct, sexual excitement, or sadomasochistic abuse.' Cox said she wants her actions to make clear that these types of images are not acceptable for public display. 'I hope my efforts will inspire others to speak up within their communities,' Cox said in an email.

Victoria's Secret has images of women in lingerie, but their clientele is different, he said. 'This is a store that caters to junior high and high school age kids,' said Kallas, mall manager for 40 years.

Half an hour a day on an iPad or computer can improve eyesight by up to a third and give users superhuman vision, research reveals. Many of those who took part in the scientific experiment ended up with eyesight much better than normal 20/20 vision - and could read an eye chart from three times further away. US scientists devised a two-month eye training programme that involved spending 25 minutes a day solving visual patterns on a screen – but designed in a way to make the brain work harder rather than the eyes. Scientists discovered half an hour a day on an iPad (pictured) or computer can improve eyesight by up to a third . The patterns became dimmer and therefore harder to find as the programme wore on - but designed in a way to make the brain work harder rather than the eyes themselves. Other eyesight training programmes exist but they concentrate on making eye muscles work harder. This one, according to its creators, specifically tested the brain because the volunteers had to choose patterns and think about what they were doing. And the spectacular results at the end of it defy the traditional belief that looking at a screen every day is bad for your eyes. For those who took part in the experiment - in this case members of a US university baseball team - came out of it with stunning improvements to their basic eyesight. According to the results, published in the specialist journal Current Biology, eyesight improved, on average, by 31 per cent among the 19 players taking part. Baseball players from the University of California, Riverside (UCR) it meant they could see the ball better as it came to them plus their peripheral vision improved . Seven players reached a vision level of 20/7.5 (where 20/20 vision is the norm) which allows them to read text from 40 feet, almost three times further away than normal.

They were also able to pick out the ball better in fading light and at night. But now the training is being adapted to help others, from professionals such as the police to those who have had operations to remove cataracts and need help to restore their vision. Study author Aaron Seitz said: 'The goal of the programme is to train the brain to better respond to the inputs that it gets from the eye. 'Our potential is greater than our normal level of performance. 'When we go to the gym and exercise, we are able to increase our physical fitness; it’s the same thing with the brain.

A teenager who was given just days to live after becoming the only boy in the world with two forms of cancer has baffled doctors by making a miraculous recovery. Deryn Blackwell, 14, was diagnosed with leukaemia aged ten and developed rare Langerhans Cells Sarcoma two years later. After undergoing four unsuccessful bone marrow transplants his parents were told the treatment had failed and he was unlikely to survive longer than 50 days. Deryn Blackwell was given just days to live after becoming the only boy in the world with two forms of cancer. But he has now baffled doctors by making a miraculous recovery . Deryn, pictured with comedian Russell Howard, diagnosed with leukaemia aged ten and developed rare Langerhans Cells Sarcoma two years later . By day 46 they moved into a hospice to prepare for his death and even planned his funeral together. But two months later Deryn is still alive and gaining strength - baffling doctors who thought they could do no more to save him. His mother Callie Blackwell, 33, also believes her son has drawn strength from the many celebrities who have backed his plight - including Simon Pegg, Russell Howard and Paul Hollywood. The mother-of-two, who is now a full-time carer for her son, said: 'After the fourth transplant they told us it had failed - this was in the first week of December last year. 'They told us that he would probably struggle to reach 40 days after the last transplant and that after 50 days we could forget it really. 'When Deryn reached day 46, we were sent to a hospice to prepare for his death. 'It got to the point where his funeral was planned - he’d picked the music, the guests, the venue and the dress code. After undergoing four unsuccessful bone marrow transplants his parents were told the treatment had failed and he was unlikely to survive longer than 50 days . 'We had all sat down together to plan it so that it would be how he wanted. I guess he won’t have to plan a funeral again though!' Deryn, from Watton, Norfolk, was first diagnosed with leukaemia in July 2010 after his glands swelled and he lost his appetite. Two years later, he was told he had Langerhans Cell Sarcoma, one of only six people in the world with the condition. He was transferred to Bristol Royal Hospital for Children last February for specialist treatment. His mother, and father, Simon, 34, and nine-year-old brother Dylan, moved into a house nearby, provided by a charity. By day 46, Deryn's family had moved into a hospice to prepare for his death and even planned his funeral . He was given four bone marrow transplants - two of which were his own - in an attempt to beat the cancer. Deryn, who was sick up to five times a day, would often ask his mother when the end would come. Mrs Blackwell said: 'Deryn had certainly accepted his death. It wasn’t that he’d given up but he’d got to the point that he was ready to embrace it. 'When someone gives up, they question what the point in living is. Deryn wasn’t like that - he was just very calm about it all. 'Deryn said to us: ""When you finally accept your fate it is the best time of your life - you just accept it"".' 'He handled himself very well - he had prepared himself to not have a future. He had been so ill that he was looking forward to dying. Deryn with Birds of a Feather stars Lesley Joseph, Linda Robson and Pauline Quirke during his fight with the disease. He was given four bone marrow transplants - two of which were his own - in an attempt to beat the cancer . 'It was like telling your child you are going to Disneyland and then keep putting it off. 'He kept asking when is it going to happen - he wanted to escape from everyone poking him all the time. He was sick of being dictated to. 'But the better he is getting, the more positive he is about being alive. 'The problem is now his future is a little uncertain again and that’s something he didn’t like before - the unpredictability of it.' In December, after the treatment had apparently failed, his family were moved into Children’s Hospice South West in Wraxall, North Somerset, and told they had to come to terms with losing Deryn. It is believed that his body has now started producing white blood cells to fight the cancerous cells - which doctors thought the fourth bone marrow transplant had failed to do. Deryn with TV baker Paul Hollywood. The teenager's mother says that as his treatment repeatedly failed, he became prepared for his death . Mrs Blackwell explained that doctors believed he would be able to make a full recovery, thanks to his latest bone marrow transplant. She explained that while Deryn was ill, he needed continuous blood transfusions as the cancer prevented his body from producing the blood cells it needed. Now he has not needed a blood transfusion for over six weeks. This means his final bone marrow transplant grafted, meaning his body has accepted the transplant and his bone marrow is now able to function properly. Mrs Blackwell added that doctors are now preparing to remove the catheter in Deryn's chest, a sign that they believe he will not need any further treatment. She said: 'On day 104, after his transplant, doctors told us that Deryn had officially grafted - despite the fact they said this was impossible after 50 days. 'Essentially,  the bone marrow transplant is doing what it should be doing. His blood count is back up now - he has to have tests every week just to check it's ok. But two months after it was estimated he may die, Deryn is still alive and gaining strength - baffling doctors who thought they could do no more to save him. It is believed that his body has now started producing white blood cells to fight the cancerous cells . 'Obviously it still isn't quite where it should be but he hasn't needed a blood transfusion for six weeks which tells us that his body is now able to produce its own blood cells. 'The doctors have told us that they now see no reason that Deryn should have to worry. 'Next Friday he is booked in to have his central line (skin-tunnelled venous catheter) removed  which is the doctors' way of saying ""it's over"". 'They certainly wouldn't be taking it out if they had any reason to believe he may be needing treatment again any time soon. 'There will be no more drugs, no more blood transfusions and certainly no more chemotherapy. 'For now, at least, we don't need to worry. Deryn’s struggle has touched the hearts of many famous faces, including Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, and he now claims to be best friends with funny-man Russell Howard. In November star baker Paul Hollywood made his dreams come true by taking him for a spin in a £170,000 McLaren supercar. Deryn's mother Callie said: 'The doctors have told us they now see no reason that Deryn should have to worry any more' Mrs Blackwell said: “He has become friend with quite a few famous faces now - and many of them have still kept in touch, checking up on him which is so nice. 'Russell Howard is his best mate! He would come and visit Deryn about once a week when he was really poorly - he’d bring him gifts to cheer him up, like DVDs and stuff. 'He has also met Simon Pegg and Nick Frost - Simon actually FaceTimed him on his birthday and he quite often texts me to see how he’s getting on which is very surreal. “I think having celebrities supporting him has really helped him through- we’re not a particularly wealthy and we can’t promise big holidays or anything. 'Having people like Russ around is great because he’s been able to offering Deryn things that we never could. 'He’s part of Russell’s tour and he’s been told he can have tickets to any of the shows. 'Things like that have really motivated him. They have given him something to look forward to, which is really special when you didn’t expect to have a future.

The aspiring Puerto Rican actress whose parents feared had been sucked into the sex trade has been found safe and relatively well in a Miami-Dade jail. Edmaire Lafontaine-Perez, 21, was arrested on January 27 on charges of defrauding an innkeeper, resisting an officer without violence and bribery under the alias of Tieres Rodriguez-Perez, Fort Lauderdale Police said on Monday. Her frantic parents, including father Edwin Lafontaine, have been informed their daughter is fine, ending their panic which began on January 26 when she made a disturbing and disjointed phone call in which she told her mother that she was being chased and was in fear of her life. Her mother, Manuela Perez, told Univision Radio that she doesn't know how the young girl ended up in jail. 'I have not spoken to her, but in due time we will know,' her mother said. 'Thank God my daughter is fine and it is a miracle.' Edmarie Lafontaine, originally from Puerto Rico, moved to Fort Lauderdale in December to study biology but also expressed an interest in becoming an actress - and her parents became concerned that she had fallen in with the wrong crowd. The hysterical January 26 phone call where relatives say she sounded high on drugs was the last contact the missing woman had with her family before disappearing almost three weeks ago.

Authorities have spent the past two and a half weeks searching for her, only to find her in jail.

'She told her mother she feared for her . life, that they were chasing her,' he told the station.

The ad showed the extension tube or 'wand' being compacted before the vacuum cleaner was seen, without the wand or hose, being placed on a shelf in a cupboard. A voice-over said: 'So there you have it, the smallest, quietest Dyson Ball vacuum.'

A viewer complained this misleadingly implied that the extension tube and hose could be folded away into the product when they understood this was not the case. Dyson said the shot of one part of the wand sliding into the other showed it was made of two large parts and did not slide into the body of the machine. It said that, as with all their cylinder machines, the hose and wand were removable for easy storage, and its products were often displayed with the hose and wand disconnected. Inventor James Dyson launched the Dyson company in 1993 . The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) noted the ad included a scene which demonstrated how part of the wand collapsed into itself immediately followed by the final scene which showed the body of the machine being placed on a small shelf. It said: 'We considered that viewers would understand from this sequence that one of the advantages of the machine was that it could be stored in a small place and considered that, unless shown otherwise, viewers would understand this to mean that this storage involved the machine in its entirety, including the hose and wand. 'We therefore considered that consumers would understand from these final scenes that the wand and hose collapsed down further than shown and that it was possible for them to be collapsed down into the body of the machine. 'Because this was not the case, we concluded that the ad was misleading.' It ruled that the ad should not appear again in its current form.","The ad showed the 'wand' being compacted before the vacuum cleaner was seen, without the wand or hose, being placed on a shelf in a cupboard .

Foreign migrants will be banned from receiving benefits unless they earn a minimum of £149 a week, under new rules unveiled today. From March 1st people from European countries who claim to have been in work or self-employed in order to gain access to a wider range of benefits will face a more robust test. Under current EU law the definition of a ‘worker’ is very broad meaning that those who work just a few hours a week in a pub once a week can access Housing Benefit, Child Benefit and Child Tax Credits. Now, the definitions of 'worker' are very broad, to the point that only a few hours work a week entitle a person to things like housing benefit and child support. But under new rules, this definition will become a lot stricter . To show they are undertaking genuine and effective work in the UK a European migrant will have to show that for the last three months they have been earning at the level at which employees start paying National Insurance. The new minimum income threshold is the equivalent of a working 24 hours a week at the minimum wage. Those who qualify as a ‘worker’ will be able to claim benefits, including JobSeeker’s Allowance if they fall out of work. They will also be able to claim Income Support and Employment and Support Allowance as well. Those who fail to meet the minimum income requirement will be classed as a jobseeker or not economically active and will have to wait three months after they start searching for work before they can claim JSA. From April 1st they will also have to wait three months before claiming Housing benefit as well. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said: ‘As part of the Government’s long-term economic plan we have taken action to make sure our economy delivers for people who want to work hard, play by the rules and contribute to this country. ‘These reforms will ensure we have a . fair system - one which provides support for genuine workers and . jobseekers, but does not allow people to come to our country and take . advantage of our benefits system. ‘The . British public are rightly concerned that migrants should contribute to . this country, and not be drawn here by the attractiveness of our . benefits system.’ Migrants to the UK will be under particular scrutiny under the new laws, in order to prevent 'benefit tourism' by new EU countries . The level of the minimum income requirement will be permanently pegged to the level of the National Insurance Contributions Threshold, which is £149 a week--£7755 a year-- in 2013/14, and £153 a week, or £7956 a year, in 2014/15. The changes come after David Cameron set out a number of areas where he wanted the benefit system to be tightened in a speech last year. The Prime Minister demanded action amid concerns from MPs that the end of restrictions on new arrivals from Bulgaria and Romania - lifted on January 1st - would lead to a huge influx of migrants. Since January 1st all migrants from the European Economic Area have been subjected to a tougher ‘habitual residence test’ and will have to wait for three months before they can get income-based JSA. If they pass the test jobseekers will then only be able to get JSA for 6 months. After 6 months, only those who have a job offer or compelling evidence that they have a genuine chance of finding work will be able to continue claiming. A DWP source added: ‘This is all part of the Government’s long term plan to cap welfare and reduce immigration so our economy delivers for people who actively contribute and want to work hard and play by the rules.’","Currently the definition regarding who is a 'worker' is very open .

Nearly one in ten British fathers harbour doubts over the paternity of their children, according to shocking new research. In some parts of the country, the figure . rises to almost one in five men who have admitted they are unsure if . they are biological father of their children. On average, eight per cent of British men - around 1.2million - say they have worried whether their children are their own. That rises to 16 per cent in Newcastle, London and Northern Ireland, research revealed. However, in Yorkshire and Scotland, men were far less likely to question if they were the biological parent of their children - with just three per cent admitting to having doubts. By comparison, three per cent of British women - some 460,000 - said they were unsure of who the biological father of their child is. The research - based on a YouGov survey of 5,266 parents on behalf of website DNATestingChoice.com - explains why more Britons are using DNA paternity testing. The findings showed clear pockets of concern in some of Britain’s cities. Fathers in the North East were the most likely to be unsure of male respondents representing twice the UK average. By comparison, mothers in the North West, in cities like Liverpool and Manchester, were most likely to be unsure who the biological father of their children was with nearly 6 per cent - twice the UK average - admitting they did not know for certain. Other factors including the age of the . parents, occupation and marital status had a bearing on how confident . they felt about their partner’s fidelity. Older . fathers proved to be more secure in their family structure, with just . five per cent of over-55s saying they were unsure of their child’s . paternity. Mystery: This map shows the percentage of mothers in each region  who are unsure who the father of their child is. The problem is greatest in North West England, while Scottish mothers have the least doubts . Meanwhile this regional map shows where in the country fathers are most likely to question their child's paternity. Fathers in Northern Ireland and North East England are most likely to have doubts . However, the research showed that 15 per cent of fathers aged between 25-34 were most likely to have been unsure. Mothers who have never married were found to be the most likely to harbour doubts about the paternity of their child. Around eight per cent - three times the national average- of unmarried mothers replied ‘yes’ to the survey. While 18 per cent of fathers who are separated or divorced said they have questioned the paternity of their offspring.

A mother's frustration is ‘growing by the day’ as she and her family wait for their insurers to accept liability for the damage done to their home in the Somerset Levels. The Kirby family were forced to abandon their Moorland cottage where they lived for 17 years when defences protecting their village failed at the height of the floods. Now Kate and husband Mark, both 44, are battling a ‘long-winded claim process’ that means they won’t receive an insurance pay-out for months. Long-winded: Kate and Mark Kirby and their family say they won't see a penny until insurers assess their flooded cottage in Somerset . ‘We’ve been told we won’t see any money until the insurers can access our house and look at the damage,’ said the teaching assistant. ‘But we know that will take about six weeks. Until then we won’t know what we’re going to get, let alone actually see a penny. ‘It’s frustrating because it’s obvious to a blind man what has happened to our property. ‘Everything feels like it is moving in slow motion.’ When the flood waters poured into Jeanette Shipp’s home, she thought she could rest easy in the knowledge she had paid her insurance premium for years. But her insurers have now told her the £450-a-year package was invalid – because she lives 200 yards from a river. Christmas Eve was the first time the 59-year-old’s home in Fetcham, Surrey, had flooded in the 28 years she has lived there. Flood water continues to surround properties in the largely evacuated village of Moorland on the Somerset Levels . The river Mole is out of sight, beyond other houses, and when Mrs Shipp last filled out an insurance form four years ago she did not disclose there was a river nearby. She is now living in the upper storey of her soaked home. To make matters worse, when the insurance firm first sent contractors to her home to start to assess and repair the damage, they dumped most of her undamaged furniture on the lawn outside. ‘It was left in the rain, the settee was ruined, and then people came along in vans and stole most of the other stuff,’ said the mother of three. ‘Then, two and a half weeks after the floods, the loss adjuster called and said I wasn’t insured at all. I’m still waiting to hear back from the insurance firm.’ Jane Matthews, 47, was forced to move out after 3ft of dirty water came spilling into her home four weeks ago. She used to have insurance but after she made an £8,000 claim when her home was flooded last year she was unable to find anyone to provide cover. The part-time supermarket worker now faces an estimated £24,000 bill to repair the home in Moorland, Somerset, which belongs to her parents. Jane, who has moved into a nearby holiday park with daughter Louise, 16, said: ‘When it was up for renewal we just couldn’t get anyone to cover because of the flooding risk. Last year we had about £8,000 of work done and it was only completed in July. Now it is ruined all over again and it is much worse this time.’ Insurance bosses met with government ministers in Downing Street to discuss their response to the continuing flooding, which has affected many parts of southern and south-west England . Suzanne Stevens’ home in Tyne and Wear is uninsurable after she made a claim for damage caused by flooding in June 2012. The full-time mother said she is ‘worried to leave her home unattended’ now that the building and its contents are not covered. Mrs Stevens said she and her husband Ian, both 41, feel they have been deserted at the time when they needed help the most. ‘It’s unjust that we have paid into a policy, year after year and you hope you never have to make a claim,’ she said. ‘But then the worst happens, and when you ask for help, the consequences are horrendous. ‘The insurance companies wouldn’t touch us with a barge pole after making the claim.’ The woman who confronted David Cameron in the street in December after her 17th-century home was flooded on Christmas Eve has given up with her insurance firms. Ericka Olivares and her husband Pablo pay £2,300 a year to insure their £275,000 home in Yalding, Kent, and the premium comes with a huge excess of £5,000. It means the couple have decided not to claim for the flood damage. Ericka Olivares speaks to Prime Minister David Cameron (left) on December 27 and Liberal Democrat minister Danny Alexander (right) yesterday . ‘The excess means if we claim, for example, £10,000 for the cost of replacing what we’ve lost in the flood, our insurers will only give us £5,000,’ said Mrs Olivares, 49, who met Treasury minister Danny Alexander in Yalding yesterday. ‘It doesn’t seem worth it, given our premium and excess will probably go up so much it will become unaffordable if we claim.’","The Kirby family were forced to abandon their Moorland cottage where they lived for 17 years .

The shocking moment a Florida painter smashed a $1 million vase by famed Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei has been caught on camera. A visitor to the Perez Art Museum Miami filmed in horror on Sunday as Maximo Caminero lifted one of the colorfully painted vases and let it smash to the ground. The sound of the ceramic sculpture breaking into several pieces as it hit the floor, reverberated around the gallery as Caminero stood with his arms by his sides. Scroll down for video . Destroyed: Maximo Caminero is seen holding up the $1 million vase . The 51-year-old is facing up to five years in prison after being charged with criminal mischief for vandalizing the Colored Vases installation. The vase was part of a 2008 piece being shown as a 20-year retrospective of Ai's work, which is often created from modified 'found' objects. In the now damaged work being shown in Miami, the artist had claimed to use vases from China's Neolithic period, which he then coated with industrial paint. The cellphone footage, broadcast by WSB-TV, shows Caminero smashing the piece while standing next to a series of photos that show Ai breaking one of the vases, believed to have been 5,000 to 7,000 years old. Caminero claimed to be an admirer of Ai and interpreted the pictures as a way to join his fellow artist in protest. Smash and grab: A visitor to the gallery caught the moment Caminero grabbed part of the Ai Weiwei display . Free fall: The ancient vase plummets to the ground . In pieces: Fragments of the ancient vase, painted by dissident artist Ai Weiwei, are scattered across the floor . 'I . was at PAMM and saw Ai Weiwei's photos behind the vases where he drops . an ancient Chinese vase and breaks it. And I saw it as a provocation by . Weiwei to join him in an act of performance protest,' he said. According to the arrest affidavit, a security guard had ordered Caminero to put the ancient vase down. Instead, Caminero smashed the vase on the . floor and 'spontaneously told [police] that he broke the vase in . protest of local artists and that the museum only displayed . international artists'. Caminero, who claimed to have been an . artist for 30 years, said he was frustrated that local artists like . himself aren't showcased in Miami-area art museums. 'I did it for all the local artists in Miami that have never been shown in museums here,' Caminero told the Miami New Times. 'They have spent so many millions now on international artists.' The . police affidavit listed the value of the vase as $1 million, but . Caminero said he had no idea it was that valuable. Valuable: Ai Weiwei's Colored Vases was created by covering urns that are thousands of years old with paint . Copy: Caminero says he was inspired to smash the vase after seeing this series of photos of Ai Weiwei . Arrest: Maximo Caminero, left, has been charged with criminal mischief after breaking an Ai Weiwei artwork . 'If you saw the vases on display and the . way they were painted there was no way one would think the artist had . painted over an ancient artifact,' Caminero said. 'Instead I thought it . was a common clay pot like you would find at Home Depot, frankly.' An official appraisal of the vase’s value is being carried out, according to a spokeswoman for the museum. Ai told the New York Times he originally believed the vase had been broken by accident, but later discovered it had been done deliberately. '[Caminero's] argument doesn’t make much sense. If he really had a point, he should choose another way, because this will bring him trouble to destroy property that does not belong to him,' he said. A statement from the museum said it was working with police investigating the damage. 'This destructive act is vandalism and disrespectful to another artist and his work, to Pérez Art Museum Miami, and to our community,' the statement added. Frustrated: Caminero was protesting a lack of gallery space for local artists . Ai is arguably China's . most famous artist, and probably best known for having designed the . Bird's Nest Olympic stadium in Beijing for the 2008 Olympics. The sculptor, designer and documentary-maker has used his art and international profile to draw attention to injustices in China and the need for greater transparency and rule of law. Caminero had a recent showing at the JF Gallery in West Palm Beach that offered a patrons a chance to meet him and 'view a sampling of the work from his 30-year career as an artist.'","Maximo Caminero charged with criminal mischief .

Success: Sapper Poloko Hiri, 33, from Botswana, has won a crucial legal battle to stay in this country . An ‘exemplary’ British Army soldier threatened with deportation because of a £100 speeding fine has won a crucial legal battle to stay in this country. Sapper Poloko Hiri, 33, from Botswana, served four years in the UK military. But Home Office bureaucrats rejected his application for citizenship, claiming his driving offence was a sign of ‘bad character’. UK Border Agency officials ruled the serviceman should be bracketed with murderers, rapists and drug dealers and ordered him to quit Britain. Spr Hiri faced certain arrest, prosecution and up to 25 years in jail back in Botswana because enlisting in a foreign army is a criminal offence. But today, a High Court judge ordered Home Secretary Theresa May to ‘reconsider’ the decision, insisting it was ‘legally-flawed’. In a damning ruling, Mrs Justice Lang said the UKBA had carried out an ‘inadequate’ assessment of the soldier’s character and had merely resorted to ‘inflexibly... ticking boxes on a form’. She said officials should not just look at previous criminal convictions when deciding immigration cases. Spr Hiri, of Limehouse, east London, who is currently studying a law degree after leaving the Army, spoke last night of his relief at the judgement. He said: ‘I’m just glad this is all over. I’m so happy. I made a misjudgement when I was speeding and I still feel like an idiot that I put a lot of people in a difficult situation, including the Home Office which had to make a tough decision. 'Exemplary' soldier: Home Office bureaucrats rejected Spr Hiri's application for citizenship because of a £100 speeding fine - claiming it was a sign of 'bad character'. Above, the soldier is pictured in Canada in 2011 . ‘I couldn’t have gone back to Botswana - I wouldn’t have been anywhere. I now want to get on with my life, finish my law degree and be a good citizen of the UK.’ His case has left the Government accused once again of ‘betraying’ the military, following round after round of spending cuts. Spr Hiri’s supporters had pointed out the UKBA’s decision was at odds with the Government’s pledge to uphold the Military Covenant, society’s duty of care to servicemen. Appeal: But today, a High Court judge ordered Home Secretary Theresa May (pictured) to 'reconsider' the decision, insisting it was 'legally-flawed' The ex-soldier, who has a two-year-old daughter in the UK with his ex-girlfriend, enlisted as a Commonwealth serviceman in the Royal Engineers in August 2008. He was eager to fulfil his dream of being a soldier but was too old to join the Botswana Defence Force. Spr Hiri joined 73 Armoured Engineer Squadron, 21 Engineer Regiment and completed exercises in the UK and Canada. In August 2011, he gave 12 months notice he wanted to leave the Army to take a degree - a move supported by commanders. He applied for British citizenship in April 2012 ahead of his Army leaving date. But the UKBA rejected his bid because he had received a £100 fine and five penalty points for speeding on the M1 after leaving Ripon Barracks for his Easter leave. He had been doing 81mph in a temporary 50mph roadworks zone at 1.30am in November 2011. He asked for the decision to be reconsidered by UKBA officials refused to budge, prompting him to launch a Judicial Review. In the High Court in London yesterday, Mrs Justice Lang ruled the Home Office decision ‘legally-flawed’ because it had not considered ‘all aspects’ of his character and background. She said: ‘Plainly, criminal convictions are relevant to the assessment of character, but they are likely to vary greatly in significance, depending upon the nature of the offence and the length of time which has elapsed since its commission, as well as any pattern of repeat offending. Claims: In a damning ruling, Mrs Justice Lang said the UK Border Agency had carried out an 'inadequate' assessment of the soldier's character and had merely resorted to 'inflexibly... ticking boxes on a form' ‘A policy on the way in which criminal convictions will normally be considered by caseworkers... should not be applied mechanistically and inflexibly. ‘There has to be a comprehensive assessment of each applicant’s character, as an individual, which involves an exercise of judgment, not just ticking boxes on a form. ‘This was not an adequate assessment of the claimant’s [Spr Hiri’s] character, as required by law.’ Dr Hugh Milroy, chief executive of charity Veterans Aid, which campaigned for Spr Hiri, said: ‘If Poloko were good enough to carry a weapon for this country, then surely he is good enough to be a citizen.’ His former officer commanding, Major Chloe Plimmer, told the court that Spr Hiri was and ‘intelligent, motivated and hard-working soldier’ with an ‘exemplary record of conduct’. She said: ‘To see that he has been denied British citizenship for what is deemed as “bad character” directly contradicts his performance as a serving soldier. ‘It appears that one moment’s act of misjudgment has defined and tarnished his otherwise good character. The offence was a foolish mistake but it is not a reflection of his character.'","Sapper Poloko Hiri, from Botswana, served four years in the British military .

The Duke of Gloucester has lost a Court of Appeal battle to allow an energy company to build a wind farm overlooking an Elizabethan ruin on his estate. Plans for four giant wind turbines to be built within half a mile of the Grade One listed Lyveden New Bield lodge on his Barnwell Manor estate in Northamptonshire were rejected as the site was deemed to be of 'international importance'. The Duke, 69, a cousin of the Queen and 23rd in line to the throne, had fought a long campaign against English Heritage, the National Trust, and East Northamptonshire Council, all of which voiced strong objections to the plans. Developers represented in court by Justine Thornton, the wife of Labour leader Ed Miliband, had hoped to build a huge wind farm on the site, which would have been easily visible from the early 17th century lodge. The Duke, a former deputy chairman of English Heritage himself, had been strongly criticised for agreeing to plans put forward by West Coast Energy. There were concerns that, had the wind farm been allowed, it could have set a precedent that put other country houses and historic estates at risk of similar developments. Simon Thurley, chief executive of English Heritage, told Oliver Moody at the Times: 'We are very pleased that the Court of Appeal has underlined the vital principle of preserving important historic places like Lyveden New Bield, one of the most beautiful and unspoilt Elizabethan landscapes in England.' 'We have continued to argue that the original decision by East Northamptonshire Council to refuse the application was absolutely right. The subsequent reasoning of the planning inspector did not pay enough attention to the significance of this exotic jewel in the landscape,' he added. Mr Thurley went on to say: 'To allow turbines here would have had an appalling impact on a very special place.' Historic: Plans for four giant wind turbines to be built near Lyveden New Bield lodge on the Barnwell Manor estate in Northamptonshire (pictured) were rejected as the site was deemed to be of 'international importance' The Lyveden New Bield lodge was commissioned shortly before the death of Elizabeth I in 1603 by Sir Thomas Tresham - a prominent Roman Catholic whose son Francis was later involved in the Gunpowder Plot. The building was never finished. West Coast Energy's plans to develop the site, which is on the edge of Catshead Woods, were originally rejected by East Northamptonshire Council in 2010. A prolonged legal battle ensued, with the Planning Inspectorate ruling in favour of the developers. That decision was rejected in the High Court last year. Now the Court of Appeal has upheld the High Court decision, although the Planning Inspectorate is entitled to launch another appeal.","Queen's cousin had agreed to four giant wind turbines on the historic estate .

"By . Sophie Borland . PUBLISHED: . 13:36 EST, 18 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 20:25 EST, 18 February 2014 . The controversial NHS scheme to share patient data has been put on hold. File picture . A controversial NHS project to harvest data from medical records has been delayed by six months in the face of opposition from doctors and patients. Officials announced last night that the scheme would be postponed until the autumn to ensure the public is first made aware what their details will be used for and how they can opt out. Tougher checks will also be made on firms wanting to access the data amid fears it will be used by insurers to raise premiums. The move comes after the Daily Mail repeatedly highlighted concerns among GPs and patients over the Care.data project, which was due to begin next month. Unless patients choose to opt out, confidential information about their illnesses, test results and medication would automatically be uploaded from their  GP file to a central database. Officials claim the information will be used by researchers to spot trends and identify poor care. But there are fears it will be passed on to firms providing health care insurance and life cover or be at risk from hackers. This week the British Medical Association and the Royal College of GPs voiced concerns that the public had been kept in the dark. A number of GPs are so opposed they have opted out all the patients on their books – with one being told he could lose his job as a result. It also emerged that campaigners were preparing to take legal action against officials for not informing the public properly how they can opt out. NHS England said the project would be postponed until October while it runs an awareness campaign and tightens up checks on firms wanting data. But it stopped short of making it an opt-in scheme. Both the British Medical Association (BMA) and the Royal College of GPs (RCGP) have both warned that patients are being kept in the dark about the plans. File picture . The RCGP is calling for much more publicity of the scheme, including national TV, radio and online adverts. File picture . Tim Kelsey, national director for patients and information, said: ‘NHS England exists for patients and we are determined to listen to what they tell us. ‘We have been told very clearly that patients need more time to learn about the benefits of sharing information and their right to object to their information being shared. ‘That is why we are extending the public awareness campaign by an extra six months.’ Phil Booth, of the campaign group MedConfidential, said: ‘Finally officials at NHS England have seen reason. To upload millions of patients’ confidential data without providing full and proper information or seeking consent would have been the largest breach of confidence in NHS history.’ Labour health spokesman Jamie Reed said: ‘This is another NHS shambles of this Government’s own making. Along with health professionals, we raised concerns about the security of the data to be shared. Patients need to be assured that their records will be genuinely anonymous and that they have had the opportunity to opt out.’ Tory MP David Davis, who has raised concerns about the scheme, welcomed the postponement, saying: ‘Both the design and implementation of this database have been very poorly thought through.’ Unless patients opt out by contacting their GP surgery, officials will assume they are happy for their data to be harvested. NHS England was meant to have delivered leaflets about the scheme to every household last month but many patients never received them. And two polls this week found that eight in ten GPs did not understand the project. Pressure group 38 Degrees plans to set up a website that would enable  public to log on and prevent their data being harvested, without having to see their GP. So far 155,000 of its members – including doctors, nurses and other health workers – have said they would opt out using the website. A family doctor says he is willing to lose his practice rather than hand over patient data for a new NHS database. Dr John Cormack has vowed to opt all of his 4,000 patients out of the new care.data scheme . The GP believes confidentiality is the 'cornerstone of general practice' and is refusing to allow private companies to pry into medical records. Dr Cormack today said: 'There have been threats that GPs will have their contracts taken away if they don’t do what they are told. 'I’m not worried about it, if you’re going to criticise the NHS you’ve got to be prepared to take a bit of flak. 'Confidentiality is the cornerstone of general practice. 'Patients need to know when they come and see a GP that we’re not going to be straight on the phone saying ""Oh, you’ll never guess what I just heard from a patient"". 'It’s part of the trust built up between patients and doctors. Without that, people are very guarded about what they tell their doctors, which would make diagnosis much more difficult.' Currently patients must provide written consent before their records can be handed over to anyone. But the new scheme will mean patients’ personal information could be given out without them even knowing. Dr Cormack added: 'I’m not saying I will never hand over my patients records, I’m just saying I won’t do it without their permission to do so. 'If this scheme is as wonderful as the NHS makes out then they just need to make their case to the public and the public. 'To assume people have consented when they don’t actually know about it is a complete farce.' In January, NHS England distributed leaflets explaining what the scheme was and how people can opt out. Every household in the country was meant to receive one of these leaflets. But a survey by the Medical Protection Society found 67 per cent of people claimed not to have seen one. This is not the first time Dr Cormack has stood up against the NHS. Last month, he changed his name by deed poll to Dr John Cormack The Family Doctor Who Works For The NHS For Free.

A picture taken of the al-Hilli family just 15 minutes before they were gunned down has been released by French media. The image, which shows Saad al-Hilli, 50, his wife Ikbal, 47, with their two children, was part of a shocking collection of crime scene photographs taken in the aftermath of the Alps shooting. The photos were revealed as a former police officer was arrested in connection with the murder of Mr al-Hilli, a British engineer and his family while they were on holiday. Scroll down for video . Final moments: A photo was taken of the family just minutes before the parents were killed . Arrest: A man named locally as Eric Devouassoux (left) was arrested in connection with the murders. Saad al-Hilli, 50, right, was shot dead with his wife, mother-in-law and cyclist Sylvain . Mollier . Scene of the crime: A photograph taken by police show the al-Hillis' car with the body of French cyclist Sylvain Mollier lying on the ground next to it . The 48-year-old, named locally as Eric . Devouassoux, lives close to where Saad al-Hilli, 50, his wife Ikbal, . 47, and her mother Suhaila al-Allaf, 74, were shot near Lake Annecy, in . eastern France. The trained . marksman and gun collector served for France’s municipal police in the . town of Menthon-Saint-Bernard before leaving last June. This . morning, it was reported that an antique Luger pistol has been in . Devouassoux's home, the  same type of weapon was used to gun down the . al-Hilli family and the cyclist. Sketch: The arrest came after police released an artist's impression of a male motorcyclist wanted in connection with the murders . Searches of two properties . linked to him yielded more than 10 weapons including a pistol similar to . the 7.65mm Luger P06 used in the bloodbath. While . the hand gun found in Devouassoux’s house in the village of Talloires . is of a different calibre, detectives said ‘a manual; of the PO6, which . was widely used by the Swiss Army in the 1920s and 30s, was also found. In a further development, a ‘light grey motorbike’ was removed from the property by police, who were seen digging up the garden and using metal detectors. Last night it was claimed  Devouassoux’s mobile phone data indicates that he was around the crime scene . ‘at the precise time’ the family, from Claygate, Surrey, and local . cyclist Sylvain Mollier were killed in September 2012. The . al-Hillis’ daughters survived the attack. Zainab, then seven, was shot . in the shoulder and clubbed with a pistol by the gunman, who left her . for dead. Zeena, then four, . escaped unharmed by hiding beneath her dead mother’s skirt. She was only . discovered eight hours later when police searched the family’s car. A . local police source said that 'technical evidence compiled using the arrested man's mobile phone also places him in . the area at the precise time of the crime.’ The man, who has not yet been officially named by police, is being held in custody on suspicion of ‘murder as . part of an organised gang’, said French investigators, who added there . could be more arrests soon. Murder: A crime scene image shows the al-Hilli family's maroon BMW with its windows shot out, and the body of French murder victim Sylvain Mollier lying next to it . Murder: Photo of the car at the scene near Chevaline and Lake Annecy in the French Alps where Saad al-Hilli, his wife Iqbal and his 74-year-old mother-in-law were shot dead. French police have now arrested a man . He . is the second suspect arrested since the shootings, and was brought in . following the publication of an e-fit picture said to look ‘just like . him’. The e-fit image shows . a bearded motorcyclist spotted by two forestry workers just before the . bloodbath, which was carried out using an antique Luger pistol popular . with many Alpine gun owners. Mr . al-Hilli’s elder brother Zaid was the first suspect arrested last year. But the 54-year-old has been told by British police that there is not . enough evidence to charge him in connection with the killing of  his . brother. Eric Maillaud, the French prosecutor leading the inquiry, described the arrest as a ‘significant breakthrough’. He said the arrested man, who is married, was held at gunpoint as he left his home around 10am. Guns were seized, but there was no violence, and the suspect ‘came quietly’, said Mr Maillaud. Officers . from the CIGN, a tactical military unit, joined local gendarmes in . yesterday’s raid, which is thought to have taken place in the hamlet of . Lathuile – just a few miles from Chevaline, where they al-Hilli family . were murdered. Antoine de . Menthon, the Mayor of nearby Menthon-Saint-Bernard where the man served . as a police officer, said the man was ‘removed from his job in June’ and . ‘then asked to leave communal housing’. He said that the man was trained . in the use of guns during his career in the force, and had gone on to . work as a security guard in the Swiss city of Geneva. A . second raid also took place on a house in the village of Talloires, . where police were seen digging up the garden and carrying out searches . using metal detectors. The arrested man recently bought a house in Talloires, and was renting it out. Lathuile . is also the home of Brett Martin, the British cyclist and ex-RAF . Serviceman who was the first person to find the al-Hillis’ bodies. Last . night, Mr Martin, 54, said: ‘I have just heard on the news that the man . is from Lathuile. It is uncomfortable that it is so close. I have no . idea who it is. ‘It is a like any village in England, you know your neighbours but  not everyone.’ Zaid . al-Hilli, of Chessington, Surrey, refused to comment on the arrest last . night as he left the luxury golf course where he works. The suspect . reportedly lives in the village of Lathuile – pictured - which is a few miles from Chevaline . and scene of another brutal gun murder in November last year . A . Surrey Police statement yesterday said: ‘The arrest has resulted from a . line of inquiry in France and is not as a result of the investigation . carried out in the UK.’ Mr . Maillaud said the man could not yet be named 'for legal reasons'. He . reportedly lives in the village of Lathuile – a few miles from Chevaline . and scene of another brutal gun murder in November last year. Lathuile . is also where Brett Martin, the British cyclist who was the first . witness at the scene of the Al-Hilli murders, owns a home. In . November, masked gunmen shot a woman dead in Lathuile, a hamlet next to . Lake Annecy. Two men wearing cagoules and gloves broke into the home of . the owners of a private camping site. The woman was killed by a bullet to the chest at around 2am, while her husband was hit with the butt of the weapon. Mr Maillaud, the Annecy prosecutor, would not rule out a link between the Chevalina and Lathuile murders. Investigation: French Prosecutor Eric Maillaud (pictured) said the suspect, who lives near to where the brutal killings took place, could not yet be named 'for legal reasons' There were only 8000 made in black, which is the colour the forestry workers saw. Today Surrey Police confirmed: 'Surrey Police can confirm that an arrest has been made in France today in connection with the murders of four people near Annecy, southern France in September 2012. 'The arrest has resulted from a line of inquiry in France and is not as a result of the investigation carried out in the UK.' Police have struggled to make any progress in the case despite a major investigation carried out in coordination with British officers. Saad al-Hilli's accountant brother Zaid, 54, from Surrey, was arrested in Britain in June last year on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder but police said last month there was insufficient evidence to press charges. But the French have expressed ‘extreme frustration’ at the decision, saying they still have questions to ask him and consider him a suspect. He had been involved in a dispute with his brother over their father's will. A Surrey Police spokesman last month: ‘At this stage there is insufficient evidence to charge him with any criminal offence and no further police action is being taken at this time. No evidence: Saad al-Hilli's accountant brother Zaid, . 54, from Surrey, was arrested in June last year on suspicion . of conspiracy to commit murder but police said there was . insufficient evidence to press charges . Police stand outside the home of Saad Al Hilli, in Claygate, Esher, Surrey in the days after the murders . ‘This remains a French-led investigation and officers from the Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team continue to work closely with the French authorities’. Since the deaths, speculation has surrounded whether the shooting was linked to the al-Hillis' native Iraq, or Saad's work as a satellite engineer. The horrific murder scene was discovered by cyclist Mr Martin, who found Iraqi-born Mr al-Hilli, 50, his 47-year-old dentist wife and her elderly mother blasted to death in their BMW. The al-Hillis' first-born daughter Zainab was shot in the shoulder and beaten, but survived. Her then four-year-old sister Zeena lay hidden under her mother's body and was only discovered eight hours after the murders. The al-Hilli brothers were alleged to have been locked in an inheritance dispute centred on the £825,000 home in Claygate where Saad and his family lived after their mother died from a heart attack in 2003. Zaid, who inherited half the property, claimed that in 2011 his brother began to demand his share of the house 'there and then' and pinned him down during a row. The two men never spoke again except through lawyers, but Zaid denied rumours that he had threatened to kill his brother. He said he knew little about a Swiss bank account containing the proceeds from their father's business in Iraq.","Man named locally as Eric Devouassox, 48, was arrested this morning .

Clive Mantle (pictured with Casualty co-star Jane Gurnett) broke down today as he recalled the moment his ear was bitten off . A former Casualty star had part of his ear bitten off after asking two fellow hotel guests to keep the noise down, a court heard. Clive Mantle, 56, had been woken in the early hours of the morning and had left his room twice to ‘request politely’ that two drunks quieten down so he could sleep. In the violence that followed, Mr Mantle, who was still wearing his pyjamas, lost a ‘substantial part’ of his ear, which ended up on the floor, leaving him permanently disfigured. He claimed he was worried about defending himself for fear of being prosecuted like Tony Martin – the farmer convicted of manslaughter after shooting a burglar dead. Mr Mantle, who played surgeon Mike Barrett in Casualty and currently plays Lord Umber in Game of Thrones, had been staying at the Travelodge while performing in a play at the Theatre Royal in Newcastle, the court heard. He was woken at about 4.30am on March 24 last year by Philip McGilvray, 33, and Alan French, 32, who were shouting in the corridor outside his ground-floor room. Jolyon Perks, prosecuting, told Newcastle Crown Court: ‘They had come down from Scotland with friends and they were out drinking and socialising. At 4.30am in the morning they had reached the stage where they were excessively drunk and had also reached the stage where drink converted them to being raucous and, ultimately, violent.’ The actor, 6ft 5in tall and sporting a large moustache, told the court how the pair were making ‘banshee-like’ noises which woke him up and resulted in him opening his room door. He said: ‘I cast a fairly strange figure. I had a huge moustache for the part I was playing in the play, with a T-shirt and pyjama bottoms.’ He asked the men to keep the noise down as he was trying to sleep – but the noise soon started up again. He said: ‘Male one was encouraging male two to “come and look at the old man in his pyjamas”.’ Mr Mantle, who has since grown his hair to cover the injury, said it was a ‘sport’ to them and he could hear ‘wailing and laughter’ from the men. Hearing more noise, he went to his door and warned he was going to call security but there was not a phone in his room. He was on his way to the Quayside hotel reception, walking barefoot, when the pair laid into him, the jury heard. Clive Mantle was woken in the early hours of the morning and had left his room twice to ¿request politely¿ that two drunks quieten down . Alan French, 32, (left) and Philip McGilvray, 33, (right) were visiting Newcastle and had been out drinking . Mr Perks said: ‘As he approached, the two defendants deliberately blocked his path. ‘He told them he needed to get past and placed his hands between them, and tried to force his way through, perhaps not unreasonably considering the situation he was in. ‘At this point they both decided to grab his arms and set about him. Both men threw a flurry of drunken punches, some landed, some didn’t. Ultimately, it ended with him being dragged on the ground face down.’ Mr Mantle told the court: ‘I think in total there were about 15 blows, of which only four hurt.’ Philip McGilvray, 32, from Hamilton, Scotland, pictured arriving at Newcastle Crown Court this morning where he is accused of being involved in an attack which left Casualty star Clive Mantle with part of his ear bitten off . At one point, French was on top of the actor and McGilvray was by his left side. Fighting back tears, Mr Mantle described how the ‘melee’ turned into his ear being bitten off by McGilvray. He said: ‘The next thing I was aware of was a pain in my left ear which triggered a massive response within me. The adrenaline it gave me enabled me to rip my right hand away. ‘The only thing I could do is put my thumb in his eye socket to make him release. ‘An image of Tony Martin, the guy who shot the intruders in his house, went through my mind. I have got to do enough damage to hurt him but not so much I get prosecuted for poking someone’s eye out – it’s bizarre the thing you think about at times like this.’ It was at this point, he said that his ‘guardian angel’ Alice Klenk, a nurse staying at the hotel with her partner, heard the fighting and came out of her room. She grabbed one of the defendants by his collar and held the other back with her arm to stop them having another go at Mr Mantle, the jury heard. The actor said: ‘She saved me from a lot further damage.’ Clive Mantel says he was woken up by Philip McGilvray, 33, and Alan French, 32, who were shouting in his hotel corridor last March . After staggering to his feet, he saw there was blood all over him. He said: ‘I looked down and there was my ear lying on the carpet.’ He picked up his ear and grabbed one of the men, but the pair managed to flee and Mr Mantle returned to his room with Miss Klenk, where they put his ear in  a glass of water to preserve it. The court heard how the two defendants did not return to the hotel for several hours – by which point they had tried to check in to a nearby Premier Inn but were turned away. McGilvray and French, both from Hamilton, Scotland, deny a charge of causing grievous bodily harm with intent, and will claim they were acting in self-defence. The case continues.

A heartbroken couple fear they may never be able to return to their home after a massive sink hole threatened to swallow it up. Two other houses also had to be evacuated after the massive 25ft-wide crater opened up in the street. Peter Cunningham and his wife Susan returned to their property as fears grew that part of the structure could collapse. The area around the property in . Magdalen's Road, Ripon, North Yorkshire, was cordoned off as engineers . prepared to check on the property's safety. Scroll down for videos . Torn apart: A view of one of three properties which had to evacuated after a sinkhole opened up in a Yorkshire street, the latest in a series of ground collapses recently . Emergency response: A huge crack can be seen down the side of this property in Ripon as a result of the sinkhole, prompting police to cordon off the area . Emergency services were alerted . yesterday evening after Mr Cunningham, 61, returned home to find a crack . in the wall of the detached house. He said: 'I got home and put the key into the back door but the door wouldn't open. 'I thought it was weird and then I noticed a crack in the patio and when I looked up the house wall was cracked as well.' The couple believe the danger is so great that they may never be able to set foot back in their home again. Mrs Cunningham, 60, said: 'We are heartbroken.' Terrifying: The sinkhole has undermined the foundations and caused the partial collapse of the house . Risk: The British Geological Survey has said that the most susceptible area in the UK for sinkholes is the Permian gypsum deposits of north-east England, particularly around Ripon, where this house is located . No-one . has been hurt in the incident which is believed to have been caused by a . sink hole, the sixth such incident in Britain in recent weeks. A North Yorkshire Fire Service spokeswoman said a dog was rescued from cracks in the property by fire crews. The . hole appeared just days after a proposal to build 75 homes on nearby . abandoned auction mart site was rejected by councillors due to . subsidence fears. Planning officers at Harrogate Borough Council had recommended approval for the scheme by Ripon Property Developments. 'Heartbroken': Peter Cunningham, pictured with his wife Susan (left) and (right) showing the strain, fears he may never be able to return to their damaged property . Distraught: Peter and Sandra  Cunningham leave their home after examining the damage caused by the sinkhole under their house . But the Mayor of Ripon, Councillor Mick . Stanley, urged members to reject the plans because of the risk of gypsum . subsidence causing ground instability. He said: 'My main . concern is the stability. I urge you to throw out this application as . there is insufficient evidence that development can be safe. 'Why has there been no development on the site for the past 300 years? Could it be that our ancestors knew it was unstable? 'I . don't think any development should take place on that site because it . is unsafe for building. I don't think any insurer is going to insure any . of those houses built at that site.' The . British Geological Survey has said that Ripon is one of the most . susceptible areas in the UK for sinkholes because of the gypsum deposits . there. It says large sinkholes have developed around Ripon, some of which have affected property and infrastructure. 'Weird': Peter Cunningham said he only noticed the huge crack down the side of his house when he couldn't get his back door to open . Assessing the damage: Officials look over a neighbouring wall near the properties which have been evacuated . Alert: One of the neighbouring houses which was one of three properties evacuated by police while engineers inspected the damage caused by the sinkhole in the area . Hidden danger: A graphic explaining why some areas are more susceptible to sinkholes than others . This is because gypsum is far more soluble than limestone, and thus dissolves more rapidly. Magdelen's Road is just a few hundred yards from Ure Bank Terrace, where a massive sink hole appeared in 1997. That . hole which had been known about since Victorian times was said to have . been the inspiration for the illustrations in Lewis Carroll's Alice in . Wonderland. The young girl . used as the model for the drawings used to live in a house across the . River Ure from where the latest sink hole has appeared. Meanwhile, two more sinkholes have appeared about a mile from the hole that opened up on the M2 motorway in Kent, local resident Colin Parsons said. Recurring theme: These two sinkholes have appeared about a mile from the hole that opened up on the M2 motorway in Kent last week . The two holes opened up in the past three weeks about 500 yards apart on farmland between Sittingbourne and Faversham. One sinkhole is about 9ft deep and the other about 10ft deep. Highways contractor Mr Parsons, 55, said: 'One of them looks like a giant footprint. 'The first one appeared three weeks ago. As I was walking with my wife, we went to look at another spot where one had opened up before and, sure enough, another one was there. 'The interesting aspect to this is that these have appeared about a mile from the M2 where one occurred, and they will keep opening up.' Sinkholes are an 'ongoing feature of the landscape' and the country is likely to see more as the ground is set to remain saturated for some time, according to a geology expert. The that opened up beneath a 100-year-old detached house in Magdalen's Close in Ripon, North Yorkshire, yesterday, was the latest in a spate of sinkholes. It came after a 35ft (10.7m) wide and 20ft (6.1m) deep one opened up under homes in a quiet cul-de-sac in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, on Saturday morning. Dangerous: A 50ft-deep hole appeared in the central reservation on a section of the M2 in north Kent last week . And last week a stretch of the M2 in north Kent was closed after a 15ft (4.6m) deep hole was discovered in the central reservation, while on February 2 a teenager's car was swallowed up when a 30ft (9.1m) deep crater appeared in a family's driveway in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. A range of factors - natural and man-induced - can trigger sinkhole collapse, and heavy rain or surface flooding are considered to be examples of triggers. Leaking drainage pipes, burst water mains, irrigation, or even the act of emptying a swimming pool, are also examples. Vanessa Banks, from the British Geological Survey, said: 'The ground is saturated at the moment, in certain parts of the country, and where it's saturated, it will remain saturated for some weeks, if not months. 'And gradually the situation will improve, but in the short term I suspect there will be more of these incidents being reported.' Gone: A Volkswagen Lupo was swallowed up by this sink hole in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire . Brand new: Zoe Smith, 19, was given a replacement after the car was engulfed by the hole which developed outside her home . Ms Banks said that while there has been a spate of sinkholes this month, she remembers a similar spate around 1987 when she was working in Norwich - during a period which was also 'very wet'. 'You may or may not have seen that a bus actually sunk into one of these cavities,' she said. Ms Banks said she fears that increased knowledge about sinkholes is worrying people. 'I fear that people are becoming worried because we're increasing their awareness of the occurrence of these things. These cavities have existed for as long as we have been developing. They pre-date humans,' she said. Ms Banks said sinkholes are known about and so there are guidelines for building and construction to prevent building on areas of land where there may be problems in the ground. 'We try to avoid them during construction, or we take adequate measures to stabilise them,' she said. Risk: Gretel Davidson feared she would have to pay around £10,000 after a sinkhole twice the height of a double-decker bus appeared in her garden in Banehurst, South-East London . Concern: A 35ft wide hole appeared underneath a home in Hemel Hempstead last week, prompting the surrounding properties to be evacuated . Ms Banks said it is necessary that people are aware of potential sinkholes so that they can 'manage the situation around them'.'We know they're an ongoing feature of the landscape,' she said. And she added: 'There is definitely a direct link between the infiltration of surface water and the likelihood of these occurring.' Looking ahead, Ms Banks said: 'I think we will see some more incidents over the coming months. I think we will have some reported to us here.'They may not be of the scale that hit the headlines.' The British Geological Survey has said that the most susceptible area in the UK for sinkholes is the Permian gypsum deposits of north-east England, particularly around Ripon. It says large sinkholes have developed around Ripon, some of which have affected property and infrastructure. This is because gypsum is far more soluble than limestone, and thus dissolves more rapidly. And local residents said there was a long-standing problem with gypsum-related subsidence in the area which had caused other homes to collapse over the years.","Three properties evacuated after huge crack appeared down the side of Susan and Peter Cunningham's house .

For this once humble symbol of the budget traveller is the new brief-case, hand bag and holdall, rolled into one, according to the latest research. High Street retailer Debenhams reported yesterday that it has seen a 114per cent increase in sales of backpacks which industry observers attribute to the increasing use of smartphones as they leave the wearer's hands free to text, tweet, or surf the internet. A Nineties favourite, the utilitarian carry-all has been given an upmarket make-over and become the surprise must-have accessory of 2014. Model of the moment Cara Delevingne has given the trend the ultimate stamp of approval by unveiling her own backpack collection for exclusive Brit brand Mulberry this week, while trend-setters like Alexa Chung and Rihanna, have been seen enjoying the benefits of the reborn-rucksack. According to fashion insiders the secret to this look is to remember - size matters.

Two 14-year-olds and a 16-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, have appeared in court accused of stabbing to death Rashid Naeem. Detectives decided to charge the teenagers while the market stall holder was still in hospital, because doctors said his injuries were so severe he was certain to die. The 29-year-old of East Ham, east London, was stabbed two days ago at a street market in Upton Park, also in east London. Scroll down for video .

Incident: The area where the alleged victim was stabbed was taped off today and medical equipment left at the scene . Hours after the boys were charged, their alleged victim was pronounced dead. 'The victim remains at an east . London hospital, however his injuries will prove fatal and consequently . the three youths have been accused of murder,' a Met spokesman said. Today's decision to charge three boys with murder before the victim was dead may be the the first time it has happened in British legal history, it emerged today. The Met's decision overnight marks a new but subtle change in the way some killings could be dealt with going forward. Sources at Scotland Yard said the charges were brought in advance to ensure a fair trial for the three teenagers. For hundreds of years any victim of murder had to be dead and police would have to have a body to proceed with a murder case. This was imposed after a 17th century trial where several men were hanged only for their alleged victims to appear alive and well afterwards. This framework remained until 1954, where it changed and forensic science improved. A farmer in Wales was accused of murdering his friend after blood and bone fragments were found in his kitchen. Michail Onufrejczyk, who stayed in Britain after the war, said his business partner had returned to Poland, but police believed he was murdered. Despite the lack of a body the jury found him guilty and this allowed suspects to be tried for murder based on circumstantial evidence. In recent years the most high profile use of this interpretation of the law was used to prosecute killer Mark Bridger, above, who was charged with the abduction and murder of April Jones in October 2012. Officers took the decision even though hundreds of police and locals in the Welsh town of Machynlleth were then still hunting for the five-year-old, whose body was never found. The force later issued a statement saying: 'Mr Naeem was pronounced dead this morning at Royal London Hospital. A post-mortem examination will be conducted in due course.' Similar decisions have been made when a body cannot be found, like in the case of Mark Bridger who murdered five-year-old April Jones and hid her. But Crown Prosecution Service sources admitted it could be a first in these circumstances. The three teenagers appeared at Stratford Youth Court this afternoon jointly charged with Mr Naeem's murder. Magistrates chairman Peter Dawes transferred their case to the Old Bailey for another hearing  on Thursday. Their alleged victim ran a mobile phone stall in Queen's Market, Upton Park. Police suspect he believed that the gang were stealing from him and a struggle ensued and Mr Naeem was stabbed. He was rushed to the Royal London Hospital where his condition was said to be critical. But he deteriorated and was pronounced dead earlier this morning. A post-mortem examination is now due to take place. Witnesses to the attack have told of their horror after seeing the trader attacked. Yalda Badad, 25, a pregnant mother-of-one, was walking through the market with her two-year-old daughter when she saw the 29-year-old collapse to the ground bleeding heavily. She said: 'People were trying to break them up because they thought they were fighting, we didn't realise he was stabbed until he fell and we saw the blood. 'He stood up again and looked kind of drowsy and then fell over again. The blood was pouring out. 'That man was working very hard for little money. They come at 4am when they open their stall, they are working very hard and somebody comes by, picks up their things and its the difference between life and death. It has scared everybody.' Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Scotland Yard charged boys because  Rashid Naeem was so badly injured .

Inflation yesterday fell to its lowest level for more than four years, in a further sign that the punishing squeeze on family finances is easing. Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that the Consumer Prices Index dipped from 2 per cent in December to 1.9 per cent last month. It was the first time since November 2009 that inflation has been below the Bank of England’s 2 per cent target, and fuelled hopes that the cost of living crisis is coming to an end as the economy picks up. The Consumer Prices Index rate of inflation has fallen to 1.9 per cent, but is still around twice average pay rises . The drop in inflation will give the Bank more breathing space to leave interest rates at the all-time low of 0.5 per cent. It . traditionally raises rates to combat high inflation. City analysts . hailed Britain as the ‘Goldilocks’ economy as the combination of low . inflation and strong growth suggested it was ‘not too hot and not too . cold’. Bank Governor Mark Carney last week labelled the UK ‘one of . the strongest economies in the advanced world’ as he raised growth . forecasts for this year from 2.8 to 3.4 per cent. He also insisted that . rates ‘may need to stay at low levels for some time to come’. David . Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ‘The . fall in inflation is very good news for businesses and consumers. An . early rise in interest rates is neither necessary nor likely.’ David Cameron tweeted in response to the inflation figures . But . in a sign that millions of households continue to feel the strain, . prices are still rising faster than wages, with workers getting an . average pay rise of just 0.9 per cent. Another measure of inflation – . the Retail Prices Index, which takes mortgage costs and rising house . prices into account – ticked up from 2.7 per cent in December to 2.8 per . cent last month. It is hoped, however, that wages will finally overtake . prices in the coming months following the longest squeeze on household . incomes for at least 50 years. Samuel Tombs, UK economist at Capital . Economics, said: ‘There is a good chance that CPI inflation will fall to . as low as 1 per cent by the end of this year and remain subdued . thereafter. This should enable real earnings to rise for the first year . since 2007 and allow the Bank to keep interest rates on hold until well . into next year.’ Prime Minister David Cameron said the fall in the . headline measure of CPI inflation – from as high as 5.2 per cent in . September 2011 – was ‘more evidence our long-term economic plan is . working’. The dip in inflation last month was driven by falling DVD . prices and lower entrance fees to attractions such as museums, as well . as discounts on household goods and furniture. The traditional . post-Christmas rise in whisky prices was also less than expected. Discounts on furniture and lower than expected rises in the cost of whiskey were the main drivers in the inflation fall . The Consumer Prices Index  measures inflation using a representative ‘shopping basket’ of goods. This includes items ranging from everyday essentials such as bread to other expenditures like air fares. But critics claim CPI is not a true reflection of the cost of living as it does not include housing expenses such as rent and mortgage interest payments. These are part of the alternative Retail Prices Index (RPI) – which has risen from 2.8 to 2.9 per cent, partly because of the effect of soaring house prices in the South East. In 2003, the then Chancellor Gordon Brown adopted the CPI measure as it was more comparable internationally and considered  to give a better picture  of underlying spending  patterns without the distortion of house prices. The lower figure of CPI is also convenient for the Government as it is used to dictate increases in pensions, benefits and public sector wages.","Consumer Prices Index falls to 1.9%, lowest level since November 2009 .

Allegations: During the case, Miss Giles (pictured) claimed she was ‘bullied, victimised and isolated’ at work . Both claimed their reputations were damaged because their unsuitable equipment - a Glock 17 - meant they received lower marks than men in firing range tests. They also said protective gear was too big for their small heads and legs and they were too short for a wooden barricade used as a resting place for the firearms. The barricade was built for an officer of average male height and only offered support for those much taller. The Central London Employment Tribunal found the Civil Nuclear Constabulary (CNC) guilty of discrimination against the officers. 'Unsuitable': The firearms officers claimed their reputations were damaged because their unsuitable equipment - a Glock 17 (pictured) - meant they received lower marks than men in firing range tests . Success: The Central London Employment Tribunal found the Civil Nuclear Constabulary (CNC) guilty of discrimination against the officers. Above, Miss Giles and Miss Wheatley (pictured behind) arrive at the tribunal . It is understood they are to receive £35,000 each, although the force plans to appeal. The officers were based at different stations – Miss Wheatley, 39, with an armed unit which protects the Sellafield nuclear plant in Cumbria, and Miss Giles, 32, at Chapelcross, Scotland. They were described as being ‘petite in stature’ and with ‘small hands’, but were ignored when they repeatedly asked for a smaller grip on their weapons, the tribunal heard. Miss Giles said in a witness statement: ‘All this has led to extreme distress. The stress has caused significant problems to my health.’ Protection: Miss Wheatley worked with an armed unit which protects the Sellafield nuclear plant in Cumbria . Their solicitor, Binder Bansel, of Pattinson & Brewer, said that every officer joining at the rank of constable or sergeant is required to train to recognised standards as an authorised firearms officer and maintain the standard. A cycle of annual training shoots tests their ability which they must undertake as part of their job. Mr Bansel said: ‘Continued failure at these shoot days results in an unsatisfactory assessment, which could lead to the officer being dismissed.’ The tribunal dismissed any claims of victimisation. Work: Meanwhile, Miss Giles, 32, worked at the Chapelcross nuclear site near Annan in Scotland (file picture) Yesterday, a CNC spokesman said the force was planning to appeal - saying: ‘The judgement has been passed and the CNC has lost on the grounds of indirect sex discrimination, however any claims of victimisation were unanimously dismissed. ‘As a result of what was discussed in this case, the CNC can also state it will be conducting an equality impact assessment. ‘This is to ensure that the CNC remains committed to providing the right training and equipment, together with a commitment to equal opportunities.’ Miss Wheatley and Miss Giles were members of the Civil Nuclear Police Federation, which supported the claim.

Victims of the payment protection insurance pay-outs scandal are more likely to have spent their compensation on holidays or a new car than squirrelled the money away into savings, research suggests. Nearly one quarter (24 per cent) of people who have had a PPI payout said they put the money towards a holiday, a survey for the website VoucherCodesPro.co.uk found. On average, successful claimants said they had received £2,810 - but those who spent the money said it took just two and-a-half weeks typically before all the cash was gone. According to recent figures, Lloyds' PPI costs now total a potential £9.825bn. For all banks the bill is approaching £20bn. Nearly one quarter of people who have had a PPI payout said they put the money towards a holiday . One fifth (22 per cent) of those who had received compensation said they had used the cash to buy a new vehicle and a similar proportion (19 per cent) bought a home appliance. Only around one in seven (13 per cent) people who received compensation put the money they had received into savings, while 17 per cent used it to pay off household bills. One in 10 (10 per cent) splashed out on new clothes and one in 20 (5 per cent) compensation recipients treated themselves to new shoes. PPI, which will cover a borrower’s loan repayments if they stop being able to earn money for some reason, is the biggest scandal that the financial ombudsman has ever seen. The ombudsman still gets around around 6,000 new PPI complaints a week from consumers who have been unable to come to an agreement with a financial firm. The ombudsman still gets around around 6,000 new PPI complaints a week from consumers . The insurance was often added on to loans or credit cards without people realising. Some people were given the 'hard sell' or found such policies were unsuitable for their circumstances. According to figures from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) a total of £13.3 billion has been paid out in PPI compensation since January 2011. VoucherCodesPro.co.uk surveyed more than 2,000 people from across the UK who had purchased PPI at some point, of which nearly one quarter (22 per cent) said they had received compensation arising from a mis-sold PPI claim. Those who received compensation were allowed to select more than one answer when asked what they had spent the money on. PPI was designed to protect borrowers' payments. If the borrower lost their job, had to take maternity leave or suffered from loss of income that they could not make repayments the insurance would have protected them to cover the costs until the policyholder is able to again. The misselling of PPI grew into the biggest financial scandal in the UK within the past five years and has cost banks millions of pounds. Action wasn't taken until 2005 when the Financial Service Authority (FSA) took over regulation of the general isurance market. Citizens Advice also issued a complaint to the Office of Fair Trading. That complaint included evidence of: . Excessively high prices.Only partial protection, with many exclusions which prevent many seemingly reasonable claims.Mis-selling, including high pressures sales tactics.A slow and often unfair claims process when consumers were eligible to claim. In January 2009, a year after the OFT handed its investigation over to them, the Competition Commission recommended that sales of PPI be banned alongside lending products such as credit cards and loans. In August 2010, the FSA published its PPI consultation paper which recommended that banks who had engaged in mis-selling should compensate all the customers who had been sold products using the same methods. The British Banking Association (BBA), a trade body for all UK banks, appealed against the FSA rules by seeking a judicial review to have them annulled or curtailed. By May 2010, 30 per cent of all cases coming in to the Financial Ombudsman Service concerned PPI.","Nearly one quarter of people said they put the money towards a holiday .

He is still working on his project for up to 14 hours a day at home, using online genealogy databases. Mr Sykes said: ‘You expect to have a few connections to the past, but this is a historical timeline in its own right. It just keeps going on and on and on. ‘All I had of my father’s parents were two photos of their coffins being carried out of the house, I never knew them. ‘I wanted to know, what did they die of, is it something that could affect us in the future? My family can’t believe the findings I’ve produced - it takes time to convince them that it’s true.’ Mr Sykes has also forked out £200 to have his DNA mapped - and was told it reveals Thracian ancestry, the same tribe as the famous freedom fighter Spartacus. The furthest back person on the list is King Fornjotur, the first king of Kveland - now an area of Scandinavia - who was born in 160AD. He is Mr Sykes’s great-grandfather 45 times. The oldest relative he has traced his lineage back to is Beli The Great Mawr, an ancient figure in Welsh history and genealogy - sometimes even said to be a cousin of the Virgin Mary - who Mr Sykes claims as his great grandparent 74 times. Nick Kingsley, head of archives sector development at the National Archives, said: ‘Just by the law of numbers, if you go back far enough, you’re related in one way or another to an awfully large number of people. ‘However, it’s not simply a matter of numbers and some people connect into lines that have all sorts of significant people associated with them.’ The Thracians were an Indo-European nomadic people who settled in the central Balkans around 5,000 years ago. They were a loose, tribal society, uniting only after the Persian invasions of the 6th and 5th centuries BC to establish a powerful kingdom over modern Romania and Bulgaria. Mentioned in Homer's 'Iliad' as allies of Troy, they were fierce warriors and horse-breeders as well as being skilled goldsmiths. Leader: Spartacus was one of the slave leaders in a slave uprising against the Romans known as the Third Servile War, or the Gladiators' War. He is pictured here being portrayed by Kirk Douglas in the 1960 film . Its capital was thought to be Seutopolis, whose ancient ruins lie under a large artificial lake near Shipka, in an area dubbed 'the Bulgarian Valley of Kings' for its many rich tombs. Artefacts discovered in these tombs in recent decades provide most of what is known of their culture. Spartacus lived from 109 to 71 BC and was a Thracian gladiator, who was one of the slave leaders in a slave uprising against the Romans known as the Third Servile War, or the Gladiators’ War. He had escaped from slavery in 73BC and took refuge on nearby Mount Vesuvius. He led an army estimated to have contained 100,000 men and defeated a series of Roman attacks. However, he was eventually killed in a battle with the Romans – and around 6,000 of his followers who escaped were found and crucified. The Thracians were conquered by Rome in the first century AD and the last vestiges of their cuilture were extinguished as they were assimilated by invading Slav peoples five centuries later. They had no written language, and so left no records. Prized possession: The Thracians were an Indo-European nomadic people who settled in the central Balkans.

Ancestry: An illustration of the DNA double helix, represented as the traditional twisted ladder . Mr Sykes used a scheme run by researchers at ScotlandsDNA, a company which says it can ‘trace your genetic inheritance beyond the written record’. It looks at ancestry through your fatherline - testing 15,000 Y chromosome markers - and your motherline, along every known mitochondrial DNA branch with 3,000 markers. People interested in their past can order a test pack and provide a sample of salivia in a small tube with a mouthpiece. It is advised that people should not eat or drink anything for at least an hour before doing this. The ‘spit kit’ sample should then be sent off to a laboratory. The DNA is purified from the sample, and checked for quality. Selected genetic markers in the DNA are then interpreted by experts to assign people to a specific lineage group. The lab will usually come back to people with this result within two months of receiving the sample.

Some books are almost impossible to put down, but one reader was so enamored with a copy of the children's classic Pinocchio they returned it 63 years overdue. Staff at Rugby Library in Warwickshire thought they had lost their copy of ‘The Adventures Of Pinocchio’ forever after it vanished in 1950. But librarians were left stunned when their copy of the popular children's story by Carlo Collodi was returned last Friday during an eight-day fines amnesty. A ticket found inside the cover of the 68-year-old publication had been due to be returned on New Year’s Eve 1950. If the book been been returned after the amnesty ended, the unnamed library user would have faced a penalty of £5.22 - which is the council’s cap for late returns. But if the cap wasn’t in place, based on the council’s current charges of 18p per day, the reader would have faced paying more than £4,000. Librarian Joanna Grindle said: 'During my 34 years as a librarian I have never known a book to be that overdue. 'It is amazing to think how much the library has changed since the book was taken out in 1950. 'Of course, I’m pleased to say we have plenty of other Pinocchio books in our children’s section so I don’t think anyone missed out.

Councillor Colin Hayfield, from Warwickshire County Council said: 'We are pleased that after all this time the borrower felt they could return the book. 'We always wanted to use the fines amnesty to welcome people back who haven’t visited us for a while and we hope the borrower is enjoying our services again.' The book was due to be returned the same year Princess Anne and TV presenter Jeremy Paxman were born. The popular children's book was written by Carlo Collodi . The English national football team also made its first appearance at a World Cup finals in 1950 and Sainsbury’s opened the first purpose-built supermarket in Croydon. Warwickshire County Council’s fines amnesty was launched on National Libraries Day Saturday 8 February 8 and ran until Saturday February 15.

In 2011 Pulp rocker Jarvis Cocker also admitted hoarding an old school library book which he finally returned 30 years after it was due back. The Adventures of Pinocchio was written as a children's book by Italian author Carlo Collodi in 1883. It told the story of a poor woodcarver named Gepetto who carved a marionette out of a piece of wood. The marionette came to life and became his son Pinocchio whose nose would grow hugely whenever he told a lie. The story has spawned a host of television and film adaptations, most famously the 1940 interpretation of the same name by Walt Disney.","The children's book was due back at Rugby Library on New Year's Eve 1950 .

The 28-year-old from Huntington came 14th in the Doubles luge run on Wednesday but this video was taken in 2012 as he was preparing for the race. Luge is considered to be one of the fastest, scariest and most dangerous sports in the world, even beating the skeleton in terms of speed . For instance, Matthew Antoine of the U.S won bronze in men’s skeleton with a maximum speed of 80.3 mph (129.2 km/hr). Twitter - @mattmortensen .

The first international luge race took place in Febuary 1883 with 21 competitors representing six nations. The 2.5 mile (4km) race, from the Swiss resorts of St. Wolfgang to Klosters, was won by Georg Robertson, a student from Australia, and Peter Minch, a mailman from Klosters, . They each raced to identical first place times of 9 minutes, 15 seconds . Meanwhile, the U.S. best luger, Christopher Mazdzer, had a top speed of 85.3 mph 137.3 km/hr. This speed, however, was only fast enough to give Madzer 13th place. While heading down a run headfirst on a skeleton may seem terrifying, this video proves that laying on your back and leading with your feet is just as bad. Last week, the Canadian luge coach accused Russia of cheating in the event by heating up the track. Wolfgang Staudinger said his team were cheated out of a medal by one tenth of a second because the temperature controls were tampered with, slowing his team down. Canada came fourth overall, behind Germany who took the gold, Russia who claimed silver, and Latvia who won bronze. Matthew Mortensen came 14th in the Doubles luge run on Wednesday.

A deranged nanny hated her bosses so much she replaced a bedside water bottle with toilet effluent and dipped their toothbrushes in the loo, she has confided to a US advice columnist. The former live-in nanny revealed the dirty secret and said after suffering in the role for three months, she got her bosses, a married couple, back for being ""annoying and inconsiderate"". 'I occasionally took revenge by sneaking into their bathroom and dipping their toothbrushes in the toilet,' she said. Wrong: The nanny's revenge could result in serious medical implications . According to Washingtonpost.com, the woman said before quitting for the sake of her mental health, she invented other deranged ways of getting revenge. 'The wife kept a drink bottle by the bedside table and I also put some toilet water into it as well,' she said. 'It made me feel better about my crappy situation at the time but now that I've quit (and regained some of my sanity), I'm consumed with guilt.' The woman said there may have been some serious consequences as a result of the action she took. 'I heard from a mutual acquaintance that both of them are having some kind of health problem - exactly what, I don't knowâ€”and I'm worried I may have caused this,' she said. She finished by asking for some advice. 'Should I call and confess? We didn't exactly leave on good terms.' The response from 'Prudence' was amusing but possibly not as reassuring as hoped. 'This is indeed a crappy situation all around. I'm actually surprised you quit because given your response to what you say was intolerable treatment by your employers, you attempted to cause them grave bodily harm - you all sound perfectly matched!' she said. Think twice: The advice columnist said the drastic revenge was stomach-turning . 'Making people ingest fecal matter without their knowledge is indeed likely to make people ill and leave their doctor baffled.' But despite confessing all, the disgruntled employee was advised not to own up to the horrid act as she could face drastic consequences. 'Part of me would love to tell you to rush to confess. However, I will extend you a courtesy that you didn't give your ""inconsiderate"" and ""rude"" employers,' she said. She said legal advice should be sought in the wake of the stomach-turning revenge. 'While I think this couple should know the source of their illness, confessing could leave you open to potential prosecution. You may deserve it, but you need to consider the stakes here.' 'So my suggestion is that you pay for a consultation with a lawyer and explain the situation. You also should find out what are the potential medical consequences of drinking toilet water. It may be that the need to get a proper diagnosis for this pair is crucial to their treatment, and you must consider that and bring it to the attention of your lawyer.' Prudence finished off by offering one last piece of advice. 'While your behavior makes my stomach turn, I am slightly heartened that you seem to recognise what you did was an abomination. I hope in the future you recognise that if you're in a poisonous situation, you simply get out without trying to poison anyone else,' she said.","After putting up with rude bosses for three months, a former nanny got revenge by dipping their toothbrushes in the toilet .

"By . Ryan Lipman . PUBLISHED: . 19:01 EST, 18 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 21:19 EST, 18 February 2014 . A Chinese university student has been condemned to death after he was found guilty of fatally poisoning his roommate with drinking water. Lin Senhao, 27, claimed that the death of Huang Yang, also 27, was an accident after an innocent April Fool's Day prank which had ended in tragedy. However, a judge sitting at Shanghai Number Two Intermediate People's Court ruled that the act was malicious and Lin had intentionally murdered his roommate out of spite. Trial: April Fool killer Lin Senhao, pictured centre, gets the death sentence for poisoning drinking water that killed his university roommate . Mr Huang drank water from a spiked dispenser at a prestigious Shanghai university on April 1 last year but did not die until April 16 of liver, kidney and lung failure according to the Shanghai Municipal People's Procuratorate. A post-mortem revealed that he had been poisoned with the toxic chemical N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), which Lin had taken from the Shanghai hospital laboratory where he was an intern. At trial in November, the defendant confessed to poisoning the water, but stated he never intended to kill Mr Huang. The Global Times reported that prosecutors rejected Lin's argument by claiming he was familiar with the chemical he put in the water as he had used it in experiments on laboratory animals and therefore knew what he was doing. 'The defendant Lin Senhao committed intentional homicide by poisoning due to trivialities. The method was ruthless, the harm to society was great, the crime extremely serious,' the court said in a statement. Homicide: A photo of murdered student Huang Yang where his classmates raise funds for him at Fudan University . Prosecutors added that Lin killed Mr Huang in an intentional homicide because of a grudge he held against over ""trivial daily matters."" It was also claimed that Mr Huang often described Lin as ""stingy,"" and once criticising their other roommate's bad behaviour to Lin's, which angered the April Fool murderer. Lin's lawyers argued against any intention, claiming ""trivial daily matters"" were not enough for Lin to commit the murder and he would have used a different chemical if there was intention to kill due to NDMA's strong odour. Lin stated he was prompted to do prank after Mr Huang announced his own plans to trick someone on April Fool's Day, but he only wanted to cause Mr Huang some discomfort. But Lin's understanding of NDMA is extensive and he has  published several articles with descriptions of experiments with the chemical in national academic journals, including measuring lethal volumes in mice. Creating a killer dose, Lin put at least 30 grams - 10 times the fatal does for an adult man of Mr Huang's size - of the chemical in the water dispensers on March 31 at about 5.50pm. Prosecutors said Lin had taken the chemical from an experiment at the hospital on the same day. NDMA is primarily used for research and according to the US Environmental Protection Agency exposure in humans may cause liver damage and affect the blood. After drinking the toxic water on April Fool's Day, Mr Huang was hospitalised the next say and transferred to intensive care the following day with liver failure, plunging blood platelets and fever. Distraught: Yang Guohua, mother of victim Huang Yang, is hysterical after leaving Shanghai Number Two Intermediate People's Court . After doing an ultrasonic examination on Mr Huang on the morning of April 2, Lin told him there was nothing wrong with his liver and he even visited Mr Huang in hospital and prosecutors used this to blame Lin for doing nothing to save Mr Huang's life. With his condition remaining undiagnosed for eight days after drinking the chemical, Lin's other roommate, Ge Jungi, not a resident in the dorm at the time, remembered Lin had written articles about the chemical. When police found the chemical in the water dispenser and arrested Lin, he confessed. Police also found Lin had searched murder cases involving fatal doses on his laptop from April 1 to April 4. The court said Lin could appeal the sentence and China's top court must review death sentences before execution can take place. The crime has been compared to a 1994 case that saw a student at Tsinghua University in Beijing allegedly poisoned with thallium, a toxic chemical used in rodent and insect poisons, by classmate Sun Wei while the two were studying chemistry. The victim, Zhu Ling, survived the poisoning but lives severe brain damage as a result. CNN reported that at almost 40 years old, Zhu remains mostly bed-ridden, practically blind and with the mental capacity of a 6-year-old child, despite previously being a keen swimmer and skilled musician. Despite being suspected of the poisoning, Sun, who has family connections with Chinese officials, was never tried and now lives abroad.

MPs today rounded on John Bercow for complaining about 'yobbery' and 'public school twittishness' at Prime Minister’s Questions. The Commons Speaker has written to David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg warning the public risk being alienated from democracy by the ya-boo nature of the weekly confrontation. But Tory MPs hit back, accusing Mr Bercow of 'whining' and losing control of the Commons because of his 'bias' towards Labour, adding that one of his predecessors, Baroness Boothroyd, had never felt the need to complain. Alarm: John Bercow has written to the leaders of the three main political parties to demand talks on improving PMQs . It follows MailOnline's revelation that . members of the public have written to Mr Bercow criticsing him directly . for his handling of PMQs. Some viewers accused the Speaker of treating the Prime Minister ‘like a two-year-old’ and ‘appalling behaviour’ in letting Labour ‘get away with saying what they want’. Despite PMQs being the only regular event in parliament to gain any signiciant number of viewers, Mr Bercow has railed against the wall of noise that faces Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband in particular as they clash over the despatch box. But Tory MP Alec Shelbrooke compared Mr Bercow's troubles to predecessor Bettey Boothroyd who he said had 'no need to resort to whining' while Sarah Wollaston said it was up to the Speaker to not call people responsible for heckling. Mr Bercow's letter to the party leaders comes in the wake of a string of boisterous and loud exchanges which, according to a recent study, is alienating the public. But he also claimed 'good female' MPs were leaving Parliament - with the charged comment that they were 'less inclined to screech and shout'. A Hansard Society report revealed that  67 per cent of respondents felt 'there is too much party political points-scoring instead of answering the question'. Only 12 per cent agreed that 'PMQs makes me proud of Parliament'. Anger: Bercow said people think Prime Minister's Questions (pictured) is very male, very testosterone-fuelled and, in the worst cases, full of yobbery and public school twittishness . How MailOnline revealed details of letters sent to Mr Bercow last year . Mr Bercow said he was not expecting . MPs to behave like 'Trappist monks' and appreciated 'passions will be . aroused' in the Commons. But . he added: 'There are people who think culturally the atmosphere is very . male, very testosterone-fuelled and, in the worst cases, [full] of . yobbery and public school twittishness'. The Speaker told The Independent . that he regretted that 'some very good female members of Parliament on . both sides' are leaving the Commons at the next election, and added that . women were generally 'less inclined to screech and shout'. However MPs suggested the solution to the problem lay with Mr Bercow himself. Tory Alec Shelbrooke wrote on Twitter: 'Bercow needs to look in the mirror. Betty [Boothroyd] never had the need to resort to whining.  His biased approach is why he's lost control of PMQ's.' Sarah Wollaston, Tory MP for Totnes, said: 'Speaker could just stop calling the worst PMQ hecklers & ban the crap planted ""helpful"" questions.' Douglas Carswell, Conservative MP for Clacton, also wrote on Twitter: 'New Bercow doctrine for  PMQs?: narks never called. Planted questioners told to sit down.' Others on Twitter were divided. Walaa Idris said: 'Speaker Bercow's complaints about heckling MPs at PMQs doesn't make any sense when he has the power to decide which questions are asked.' Marcus Stead said: 'What is John Bercow talking about? PMQs would be very dull without any jeering. Most views [sic] quite like it.' WHAT VIEWERS SAID ABOUT PMQS IN LETTERS TO JOHN BERCOW . John Bercow has warned people against passing judgement on his marriage to reality TV star Sally. Mrs Bercow recently grabbed the headlines when photographs emerged of . her kissing DJ and personal trainer Clinton Oliver at a London . nightclub. When asked about . the pictures, Mr Bercow said: 'Most people out there know that every . family has its issues. 'All marriages are different from each other and I . think that there's something to be said for people looking after their . own business and allowing us to look after ours. 'People shouldn’t assume that they know what is right . or that it is necessary for them to prescribe for others. 'Sally and I have known each other for a very long time and I think we’re quite capable of looking after ourselves.' Mrs Bercow has also said in recent weeks: 'No marriage is perfect but ours works for us.' Last year MailOnline revealed public disgust at ‘braying’ MPs during . Prime Minister’s Questions is laid bare today, in a catalogue of angry . letters to Mr Bercow which branded them morons, t**ts and a throwback to the 19th . century. Dozens of complaints were sent to the . Speaker's office from September to November about the behaviour of . heckling, insulting and . guffawing MPs in the House of Commons. While . the postbag fell short of the ‘bucket loads’ which Mr Bercow boasted . of receiving every week, it revealed some of the anger at Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband. Mr . Bercow has been dogged by bad publicity since taking up the role as . Speaker, and he is seen by Tory MPs as being biased towards the Labour . Party. Letters, emails and web messages . repeatedly accused MPs of behaving like football hooligans, naughty . schoolchildren, ‘rowdy buffoons’, ‘morons’ and ‘braying donkeys’ who do . not live in the real world. It . is claimed MPs behave like 19th century ‘public schoolboys’ who think . they are still in the Bullingdon Club, the Oxford University dining . society which counted Mr Cameron and George Osborne as members and is . famed for smashing up restaurants. However Mr . Bercow himself also faced criticism, . with one letter warning ‘revolution will be inevitable’ if he is . unable to act to curb the noise. A couple of . letters even chided the Speaker for complaining that the public do not . like the noisy hullabaloo every Wednesday at midday. One email said: ‘I . do not find the noise levels a problem at all; the microphones in the . chamber do an excellent job of amplifying the voices of the speakers. ‘I . would far rather listen to PMQs with the barracking and noise from the . backbenchers, than having the Speaker interrupt the Prime Minister and . the Leader of the Opposition when they are in mid-sentence.’","Commons Speaker has written to party leaders to demand reform of PMQs .

"By . Michael Seamark . PUBLISHED: . 19:22 EST, 18 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 19:22 EST, 18 February 2014 . Action: Leading world press freedom organisations yesterday urged David Cameron to 'take immediate steps to safeguard press freedom in the UK' Leading world press freedom organisations yesterday urged David Cameron to persuade Parliament to repeal legislation underpinning the Government’s Royal Charter on press regulation. In a letter to the Prime Minister, seven major international bodies described the Charter as ‘incomprehensible arcana’ and warned that ‘autocratic’ foreign leaders are already using it to justify repression. The bodies – including the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers – urge Mr Cameron to ‘take immediate steps to safeguard press freedom in the UK and to ensure that the actions of your government are never used to justify media restrictions elsewhere in the world’. They add: ‘Indeed, it should be a source of serious concern to your government that autocratic leaders seeking to limit media freedom now cite the British example.’ The Royal Charter was drawn up by politicians and approved by the Queen in October in the wake of the Leveson Inquiry into alleged wrongdoing by journalists. It underpins with statute a new body to oversee the regulation of the Press, with publications that refuse to comply facing ‘exemplary’ damages in libel cases. Newspapers and magazines have refused to sign up to the new regime over fears it would bring to an end 300 years of press freedom. Instead, the Press is establishing a fully independent body to police its activities, known as the Independent Press Standards Organisation. It will be able to impose fines of up to £1million for serious and systematic wrongdoing. The press freedom organisations – who visited Britain last month – describe the charter as a ‘medieval vestige’ and ‘a convoluted process virtually incomprehensible to anyone not versed in its arcana’. Warning: Seven major international bodies described the Government's Royal Charter as 'incomprehensible arcana' and warned that 'autocratic' foreign leaders are already using it to justify repression (file picture) Their letter said: ‘This Parliamentary action, in our view, establishes statutory underpinning for media regulation. This means that the Rubicon has, in fact, been crossed. ‘It is our view that the Parliamentary action that essentially compels participation in the regulatory mechanism belies claims that it will be “voluntary”.’ They told Mr Cameron he should urge Parliament to repeal the statutes that underpin the Royal Charter. The press freedom groups  told the Prime Minister how repressive regimes are already citing the Charter to justify gagging their own critics. Request: The bodies also asked Mr Cameron to distance himself from the investigation into The Guardian over the leaks by National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden (pictured) They highlighted Ecuador’s President Rafael Correa who ‘has championed one of the most repressive media laws in all of Latin America’ and who has ‘explicitly invoked the British example in defending his actions’. The letter quotes a speech by Correa last year in which he denounced his critics and said: ‘The United Kingdom has created a communication law to regulate the excesses of a certain yellow press in that country.’ It also relates how the editor of a newspaper in Pakistan disclosed that officials ‘now routinely cite actions of the British government in pressing the Pakistani media to “self-regulate” or face government action’. The press freedom groups tell Mr Cameron: ‘Britain’s democracy, including its robust and diverse media, has been an inspiration to people around the world who struggle to be free, and is a source of British “soft power” and influence.’ Referring to recent examples when Mr Cameron highlighted the dangers and difficulties of journalists working in Somalia and Sri Lanka, they continue: ‘Your ability to exercise this kind of positive influence rests  on the perception that the British media operates free of government interference. ‘Any action that diminishes that perception not only emboldens autocratic leaders to take repressive action against the media but it erodes the ability of Britain to exercise moral suasion.’ The letter also asks Mr Cameron to distance himself from the investigation into The Guardian over the leaks by National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden. It says the Prime Minister should ‘refrain from any public comments to avoid the perception of political pressure’. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Freedom groups have urged David Cameron to 'safeguard press freedom'

The drug-dependent daughter of Coronation Street star Johnny Briggs has been jailed and his heroin addict granddaughter remanded in custody after both admitted shoplifting. Karen Briggs and her daughter Emma Beach - who are both drug addicts and have notched up 48 convictions between them - admitted stealing candles, valued at £400, from a Clinton Cards store in Surrey. Briggs, 48, was jailed for six months, after also confessing to taking a neighbour's parcel. Daughter of Coronation Street actor Johnny Briggs, Karen Briggs, left and his granddaughter Emma Beach,  right, appeared at Guildford Crown Court for sentencing today. Briggs was jailed for six months, while Judge Peter Moss deferred Beach's sentence, while he considers a drug treatment programme . Her daughter Beach - the granddaughter of the Corrie actor, who played Mike Baldwin for 36 years - had her sentence deferred, while the judge explored rehab options. Judge Peter Moss, presiding over the hearing at Guildford Crown Court, questioned whether the 25-year-old heroin addict would be suitable for a drug treatment programme. But he told the court he was concerned he might be 'setting her up to fail'. He told her lawyer: 'I’m sure she would love it if somebody would wave a magic wand and she would no longer be addicted to heroin. 'I don’t own that magic wand.' Prosecutor Gino Connor told the court: 'On September 30 last year, at Clinton Cards in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, one of the assistants noticed two females. 'They went straight to the display of the Yankee Candles. They were in the store for about 10 minutes and were being observed. 'The observer noticed a rustling of bags and thought items were being packed in the bags.' The shop worker then watched as the older woman left the store, said Mr Connor. Actor Johnny Briggs, pictured collecting an MBE from the Queen in 2007, played Mike Baldwin in Coronation Street from 1976 to 2012. His daughter Karen Briggs revealed in court he has undergone a prostate operation and test for skin cancer . 'When she looked at the display she could see the display looked empty, with only three candles remaining,' he added. He told the court, by this time, the younger woman had also fled the shop. Police were called to the shop and descriptions of the women were provided by staff. Briggs and Beach were arrested around a month later, when police officers pulled over a green Ford Fiesta. The car was being driven by Beach, 25, and her mother Briggs was in the passenger seat. Officers noted a number of Yankee Candles in the foot well of the passenger seat. Briggs claimed the candles had been bought at a car boot sale, with the intention of selling them on at another sale. However, officers who knew the pair because of their history of drug-related thefts arrested Briggs after spotting the parcel addressed to another woman in the boot of the car. The parcel was intended for Linda Warner, a neighbour of Briggs and Beach in Cobham, Surrey. Both defendants denied the charges against them and opted to be tried by a jury at crown court. But the pair entered last minute guilty pleas, admitting stealing the candles. Judge Moss was told both women have extensive criminal pasts related to their class A drug habits. Briggs had 32 convictions for 52 offences, while her daughter had 16 convictions for 23 offences. Andrew Forsyth, representing Beach, said: 'She is thoroughly ashamed of her record. She has explained it’s time to grow up. 'Miss Beach has not had the easiest start to life. Johnny Briggs, pictured as Mike Baldwin, with his on screen wife Amanda Barrie as Alma Baldwin . 'She wants to change. She has said she feels she may have a chance away from her mother.' Di Middleton, mitigating for Briggs, said her client was ashamed by what she had done. 'Her circumstances are slightly unusual. You will see reference (in the Probation Service’s pre-sentence report) to an unusual upbringing - some issues regarding childhood. 'Her father is an extremely well-known figure in television. She’s extremely ashamed at what she has done to her family and what she has done to her daughter. 'Nothing could be harder for her to see her daughter reduced to the same circumstances, with her as this poor role model, rather than her grandfather as this very good role model.' She said Briggs is keen to rebuild broken relationships with her family, including her father, who she said has faced a prostate operation as well as tests for skin cancer. Judge Moss told Beach he would put back her sentencing for three weeks to see if she were deemed suitable for a drug rehabilitation referral and that she would stay in custody until then. He said to Briggs that taking her neighbour’s parcel had been 'a mean offence'. 'You are addicted to drugs and you have many, many previous convictions for shoplifting,' he said. 'The reality is this is a case which is effectively one of repeat offending, in relation to shoplifting, no doubt to feed your drug habit. 'I’m told you have what are described as unresolved issues regarding your parents and you bear responsibility for the situation as regards your daughter.' He added: 'It is plainly a custody matter and the sentence I impose is one of 18 weeks for the candles, and for the package, six weeks consecutive, making a total of 24 weeks.' He refrained from making Briggs and Beach paying costs or compensation, after taking into account their financial situation. In the last year the curse of the cobbles has struck, with cast members suffering a string of scandals, from sex allegations to real-life love splits and big names fleeing Weatherfield for good. Michael Le Vell, who has played Kevin Webster for 30 years, was suspended after police charged him with 19 sex offences involving a child.

"By . Ruth Sunderland . PUBLISHED: . 19:37 EST, 18 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 19:37 EST, 18 February 2014 . Britain has overtaken Germany to become the biggest market in Europe for Ferraris. A record 677 of the luxury sports cars were purchased by UK buyers last year, an increase of five percent on 2012. The UK is now the second largest market globally for the luxury Italian cars behind American, but ahead of Germany where there were 652 deliveries, down 100 on the previous year. Hike: A record 677 of the luxury sports cars were purchased by UK buyers last year, an increase of five percent on 2012 . Wealthy British motorists now account for one in every ten new Ferraris sold worldwide. The strength of sales here partly reflects London’s status as a haven for the world’s super-wealthy and the persistence of high pay in the City. The new California T convertible, which will be unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show next month, is considered an ‘entry-level’ car with prices starting from around £155,000 on the road. It has a 3.8-litre turbo V8 engine, does around 29 miles to the gallon, can accelerate from 0-60mph in 3.6 seconds and has a top speed of 198mph. But prices can rise into the millions of pounds for one-off models made to customers’ own specifications. British celebrity owners include Simon Cowell, who has a silver Ferrari 458 Italia that cost around £175,000 and is so exclusive there is a three year waiting list for deliveries. Others including rock star Eric Clapton and chef Gordon Ramsay are fans, along with scores of anonymous bankers with bonuses burning a hole in the pocket of their Savile Row suits. However, according to Enrico Galliera, commercial director, the main reason the UK has become the Ferrari capital of Europe is that Germany has been flooded with second hand sports cars from Italy, following a tax clampdown on the rich by the Rome authorities. Luxury: Wealthy British motorists now account for one in every ten new Ferraris sold worldwide . That meant the Germans bought fewer new sports cars. As a result, Germany slipped into second place in the European Ferrari-buying league table. Police in crisis-hit Italy have been swooping on sports-car drivers in fashionable parts of Rome and Milan as well as in resorts such as Portofino in the Italian Riviera and passing details to the tax authorities in a bid to root out tax evaders. Tax agents also hunted down the owners of luxury yachts whose payments did not chime with their lavish lifestyles. Ferrari now considers its home market of Italy, which now accounts for just 3percent of its global sales, as ‘marginal’. ‘Owners of luxury cars as well as the owners of yachts are being questioned by the fiscal police, and made to feel uncomfortable,’ Galliera said. ‘The mood is not particularly favourable to the luxury car, which is funny for a country like Italy where luxury is one of the things we do best.’ Dominant: Ferrari was yesterday named the world's most powerful brand in the annual Brand Finance survey . He added that the main reason for strong sales in Britain is not City bonuses, but that the UK is a nation of petrol-heads. ‘The UK is the country where there is the highest passion about sports cars.’ ‘The California is very successful because it is very sporty with an elegant line. It is a car that can be used every day, that is less flashy and extreme.’ The United States is the world’s biggest market for Ferraris, with a record 2,035 delivered there last year, an increase of nine per cent. Ferrari was yesterday named the world’s most powerful brand in the annual Brand Finance survey. Its worldwide revenues for 2013 rose five per cent to just under £2 billion, while profits rose 5.4percent to £205m, following a decision to limit the number of cars to 7,000 to ‘maintain exclusivity.’","A record 677 of the luxury cars were bought in the UK last year .

Terrified passengers on a jet flying between Australia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have taken to social media to tell how a mystery passenger set five fires in the toilets. The Etihad Airways jet made an emergency landing in Indonesia after the first fires broke out in the toilets - but later, two hours before the aircraft was due to land in the UAE city of Abu Dhabi three more fires erupted. On arrival in Abu Dhabi police questioned passengers in small groups in the hope of finding the suspect. No arrests have been made but there are reports that police are investigating a female passenger. Panic in the skies: An Etihad flight from Melbourne to Abu Dhabi was disrupted by five fires lit by a mystery offender . Sarah Jeffery, a passenger on the flight from Melbourne, told The Age she woke suddenly to a 'loud alarm, a flashing red light and rushing crew members'. 'I looked and saw flames coming from the bin in the toilet, and two cabin crew members put it out,' she said. 'It was very smoky, and it felt like the aircraft had filled with smoke.' After the first two fires, the Boeing 777-300ER landed in Jakarta, where the plane was evacuated and passengers' bags were checked. Nothing was found and the passengers were allowed to continue their flight. Another fire was discovered as the plane was flying above the Indian Ocean. Crew members, who had been preparing breakfast at the time the fire ignited, quickly extinguished the blaze. 'At this point, we were all asked to remain seated, and the toilets couldn’t be used,' Ms Jeffrey said. ‘I was very frightened that we had two more hours before reaching Abu Dhabi, and I actually sent messages to my boyfriend and son telling them how much I loved them, in the hope that if anything happened they would receive them.' Professional golfer Caroline Martens, who was on the flight, wrote on Instagram: 'Try having someone set the plane on fire, in two different places, having to emergency land in Jakarta, get back on after hours of investigations, for the IDIOT to set three more fires in three more toilets while mid-air and nowhere to land!!!' Ms Martens, 27, who was heading home after competing in the Australian Masters tournament, told Norwegian radio and television public broadcasting company NKR that a fire was started on board 'directly while we were above the sea', reported The Age. A disgruntled passenger takes to Instagram to complain about the flight, which was forced to land in Jakarta after two fires were lit in the cabin toilets in mid-air. After security checks took place, the passengers returned to the plane and completed their journey to the United Arab Emirates, but three more fires were lit . Distressing flight: Etihad cabin crew put the plane on lock down due to the fires and people were unable to leave their seats and no food was served for the last part of the journey . 'After a few hours (into the flight from Melbourne) I noticed that it smelled like smoke...but I thought everything was fine and just fell asleep.' 'About two hours after, I woke up as the fire alarm went off again,' said Ms Martens. She tells of how the airline searched passengers on the emergency stopover in Jakarta and the fear caused when the passengers had to board the plane after nothing was found. Passengers were told that due to visa issues they had to get back on the plane and could not remain in Jakarta. 'We were all sent on a plane again without knowing who had done it. It is just not nice to know that someone will set fire to the aircraft you will be travelling with,' said Ms Martens. She said the flight attendants had told her that because of the compression in the cabin fires needed to be extinguished within 90 seconds. A worried daughter told The Age about her parents' 'horrible and stressful' journey, saying that the 'worst thing was that no-one explained the situation either to me or to my parents. 'They didn't drink or eat anything for 19 hours and they had to have their diabetes medicine.' A spokesman for Etihad said today: 'The Abu Dhabi police authorities are currently investigating the incidents and are interviewing crew and passengers. 'Etihad Airways will release further information as it becomes available.'","Mystery person lit five fires in the bathroom of a plane during a flight to UAE .

As a boy he watched the Royal Marines arrive in war-torn Kosovo, their sights set on ending Slobodan Milosevic's persecution of ethnic Albanians. It was then that 14-year-old Arben Islami made a promise to himself -  one day he would wear the green beret. Fourteen years later and the former refugee, who fled his home alone, has achieved his dream. Fourteen years after he fled his home in Kosovo, Arben Islami, 28, has achieved his dream of becoming a Royal Marine Reservist. He said watching the Marines arrive in Kosovo in 1999, as part of the NATO force to counter Slobodan Milosevic's Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which controlled the country before the war . The 28-year-old has joined the Royal Marines as a reservist, passing out as a commando last month. Marine Islami was granted British citizenship in July 2012. The next day he signed up and joined the 350-year-old Marine Corps. Marine Islami fled Kosovo shortly after seeing the first NATO troops arrive in 1999. He said: 'As children we saw the marines in Kosovo and I knew I wanted to be one of them. Then I fled and came to the UK. 'I . didn't have the intention at the time as I was only just a young kid . but when I got indefinite leave to stay here and became British I knew I . had to. 'I wanted to join up and give something back to the country that helped me so much.' When Marine Islami arrived in the UK he was placed in foster care in Birmingham. There he learned English and went to school. At the age of 14, Arben Islami fled his home alone, travelling to the UK hoping to find an uncle. He was taken into foster care in Birmingham. In July 2012 he was granted British citizenship and a day later he signed up to join the Royal Marine Corps. He has now passed out as a reservist and also works as a bricklayer . British paratroopers advance into Kosovo in June 1999 . Around 140 British troops with 15 Warrior combat vehicles, enter Kosovska Mitrovica in Kosovo, in early 2000. The troops provided reinforcement to the French soldiers already in control of the divided city . He said he has not stepped foot in Kosovo since, and has no plans to return. After signing up and completing 10 weeks of training at the Commando Training Centre in Lympstine, Devon, Mr Islami proposed to his girlfriend Anita. He put his dreams of becoming a green beret on hold, providing for his family and working as a bricklayer. Marine Islami said: 'I wanted to join up and give something back to the country that helped me' But some 18 months later, he took up his quest to become a reservist. He completed the notoriously difficult Commando Course and went on to successfully complete the four Commando tests, which culminate in a 30-mile speed march across Dartmoor. He said: 'I'm very honoured to be . part of the corps, and I just can't express my happiness enough. I . always knew it was going to be a challenge, that I would be pushed to my . limits and that is why I wanted to join. 'It . is a huge privilege, particularly coming from another country, to join . the Royal Marines because they are one of the best forces in the world.' Marine Islami has now returned to work as a bricklayer and continues to train with the Royal Marine Reserves. He said he hopes to deploy with 3 Commando Brigade, the UK's amphibious infantry, in the future. Now settled in the UK as a British citizen, he said he looked forward to a promising future with his family. 'You've got so many opportunities in England it would be a shame to waste them,' he added. 'You can be anything you want.' Kosovo is the disputed land which lies on the border of Serbia and Albania. War broke out there in February 1998 when forces under Yugoslav President Solbodan Milosevic tried to suppress an campaign for independence by the ethnic Albanians in the country. Fighting continuted in the region until June 1999. Serbs and ethnic Albanians had fought for control of the area in for decades. Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic became the first serving head of state to be indicted for crimes against humanity, by the International War Crimes Tribunal at The Hague . Despite being in the minority, Kosovo was of huge historic and emotional importance for Serbs, who considered the region the heart of their culture, religion and national identity. In 1974 the Yugoslav constitution cemented Kosovo as an autonomous province of Serbia.But pressure for independence mounted in the 1980s after the death of President Josip Broz Tito. In 1987 Milosevic was sent to Kosovo and seized the region, promising Serbians 'no one will dare to beat you again', in a televised statement. Two years later he became Yugoslav president, heralding the rise of Serbian nationalism.In the mid-1990s the Albanian rebels, the Kosovo Liberation Army stepped up its attacks on Serbian targets. By the summer of 1998 mass protests were breaking out, demonstrating at Serbian rule.Police and Army reinforcements were sent into the region to try to destroy the rebel KLA.A deal to end the crisis - negotiated by the international community in 1999 - was rejected by Milosevic. His continued persecution of the Albanians prompted NATO to intervene, launching air strikes against targets in Kosovo and Serbia in March of that year. At the same time a campaign of ethnic cleansing targeting Kosovo Albanians began. Hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians fled Kosovo during the war, seeking refuge in Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro . Hundreds of thousands of refugees fled across the border to Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro.After 11 weeks of Nato bombings, Milosevic was forced to withdraw his troops. Around 750,000 Albanian refugees returned home, while around 100,000 Serbs fled. The UN was put in charge, until agreement could be reached on whether Kosovo would become indepdent or revert to Serbian control. In May 1999 Milosevic became the first serving head of state to be indicted for crimes against humanity, by the international war crimes tribunal at The Hague. The indictment listed six specific charges of crimes against humanity, detailing the massacres of ethnic Albanians across the region. Later that year, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe undertook an investigation, interviewing 3,000 witnesses. It uncovered accounts of murder, rape and mutilation carried out by Serbs. Milosevic's trial got underway in 2002. By the time he died in March 2006 the prosecution had concluded its case but the defence was in progress. The court could not establish legally what had happened in Kosovo.","Arben Islami fled Kosovo in 1999 shortly after NATO troops arrived .

So it perhaps no surprise that Twitter could help spot post-natal depression. Microsoft scientists have identified changes in use of the site that suggest a woman is at risk of crippling mood changes after her baby is born. The information could be used to treat women sooner or simply to ensure they have the help and practical support they need after the birth. Twitter could help spot post-natal depression (stock image) and one day scientists think an app could be developed to help women get the help and advice they need . In future, it may be possible to create an app to provide early warning and dispense advice. Around one in seven new mothers suffer from post-natal depression but the stigma surrounding the condition leaves many afraid to seek help. Eric Horvitz, head of Microsoft Research’s biggest lab in Seattle Washington, hopes that by making diagnosis easier, more new mothers will get the attention they need. However, there are likely to concerns about privacy, particularly when dealing with the sensitive area of public health. Dr Horvitz began by scanning archives of Twitter messages for words and phrases related to the announcement of a birth. When he was satisfied he had identified several hundred new mothers, he began to analyse their messages from the three months before and after having their baby. Microsoft scientists have identified changes in use of Twitter (pictured) that suggest a woman is at risk of crippling mood changes after her baby is born . An infant’s wails pull at the heartstrings in a way that other cries don’t, researchers found. Just milliseconds after registering the cry, the brain’s emotion centres are hard at work. It had been thought that the brain was incapable of processing complex facets of sound in such a short time. Other types of cry, including calls of animals in distress, fail to elicit the same response – suggesting the brain is programmed to respond specifically to a baby’s cry. In 2012, a team of Oxford University scientists scanned the brains of 28 men and women as they listened to a variety of calls and cries. After 100 milliseconds – roughly the time it takes to blink – two regions of the brain that respond to emotion lit up. Their response to a baby’s cry was particularly strong, the Society for Neuroscience’s annual conference in New Orleans heard. The response was seen in both men and women – even if they had no children. Researcher Dr Christine Parsons said: ‘There is a specialised processing in men and women which makes sense from an evolutionary perspective that both genders would be responding to these cues'. He looked for changes in the amount of time the women spent on Twitter, the people they were in touch with and the language used. For instance, an increase in the use of ‘I’ suggests someone is becoming more introspective and self-focused and has been linked to the onset of depression. He then created software that analysed pre-birth tweets to predict with of over 70 per cent accuracy if a woman’s Twitter messages would show signs of depression after having her baby. Adding in her tweets in the first fortnight after motherhood boosted the accuracy to 80 per cent. A second study using Facebook posts confirmed that even although depression doesn’t hit until post-birth, changes in social network activity and postings pre-birth provide information about who is likely to be hit. Dr Horvitz said ‘we can predict future behaviour and mood with well-characterised confidence’.He told the American Association for the Advancement of Science’s (AAAS) annual conference that someone could use his basic research to create and early-warning system that a pregnant women could install on her mobile phone. He said: ‘Reading some of these tweets you can almost feel yourself in the hearts and minds of these people. You really feel for them as they struggle. ‘Imagine a new mums’ coach that was an app running on your own smartphone that might watch what you say to the world and your tweets. To spot post-natal depression, scientists looked for changes in the amount of time the women spent on Twitter, the people they were in touch with and the language used. They found that heavy use of 'I' shows a sense of isolation (illustrated) ‘It might say “I sense you might be grappling with this, here’s more reading about this, don’t worry it will last this long and here are resources for you,” versus people just being abandoned right now and crying on their own and being paralysed.’ He added that while there are likely to be ethical concerns, the app would be something that was run privately, on a woman’s own phone. Stuart Dobson, of post-natal depression charity the PANDAS Foundation, said many women with post-natal depression find the thought of a medical appointment daunting and would welcome a test they could do in the comfort of their own home. However, he questioned whether they would get the support they needed afterwards.Microsoft is also using the internet to benefit health in other ways. For instance, by looking at questions typed into computer search engines, it is able to identify women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer and see if they are getting all the health information they need. Dr Horvitz has also shown that the number of people rushed to hospital with heart failure rises as more salty recipes are downloaded from the internet.","Microsoft scientists have identified changes in use of the site that suggest a woman is at risk of crippling mood changes after her baby is born .

Thomas Gainsborough painted some of Britain’s most recognisable landscapes as well as some of the 18th century's most famous aristocrats. So, the discovery of what could be the great artist’s paints has got art historians excited. The intriguing little pots were found at the artist's home and experts believe they were used by the master. The bladders of paint (pictured) were found at Gainsborough's former house in Sudbury in the mid-1960s during a clear-out, it is only now that experts are attempting to confirm their provenance . Before the invention of tubes made of lead or tin, painters carried bladders to store the paint that they would have made in their studio. The bladders were made from pig bladder - hence the name -  and tied at the top with strong twine to keep air out. This kept the paint fresh and workable. It is unusual for such a large collection of delicate bladders of paint to survive. The ‘bladders’ of paint spent hundreds of years gathering dust in the attic at the famous 18th century Suffolk-born painter’s former house. While they were found at the property in Sudbury in the mid-1960s during a clear-out, it is only now that experts are attempting to confirm their provenance. The paints were discovered just after the house was opened to the public as a museum and art gallery some 50 years ago. The 'bladders' of paint spent hundreds of years gathering dust in the attic at the famous 18th century Suffolk-born painter's former house (pictured) Thomas Gainsborough (self portrait left) painted some of Britain’s most recognisable landscapes and famous portraits of 18th century aristocrats, such as Anne, Countess of Chesterfield (right) Executive director Mark Bills intends to feature the historic paint bladders in an exhibition, but only after they have been examined by specialists. ‘We’ve commissioned the Hamilton Kerr Institute at Cambridge University - they have lots of experience in this area,’ Mr Bills said. ‘The paints will undergo a scientific test to date them and to see if it’s plausible that they’re Gainsborough’s.’ He said that the museum is undertaking the work now that it has the funding, but it already knows that the bladders are mid-18th Century and French. Some 19 pouches were discovered in the attic and Mr Bills said it is rare to find so many together. ‘It is possible that they were a present to someone in the family but to buy paints at that time wasn’t cheap - they would have been a good present,’ he said. ‘There are secrets yet to be revealed.’ The Suffolk-born painter's former house in Sudbury (pictured) now hosts exhibitions of his work and is a museum for fans of Gainsborough . Thomas Gainsborough was born in Sudbury, Suffolk in 1727 and became one of the country’s most celebrated landscape and portrait artists before dying in 1788 aged 61. He left home in 1740 to study art in London with William Hogarth. After marrying In 1746 Margaret Burr and fathering two daughters, he moved to Bath in 1759 where fashionable society patronised him, and he began exhibiting in London. In 1769, he became a founding member of the Royal Academy, but his relationship with the organisation was thorny and he sometimes withdrew his work from exhibition. Gainsborough moved to London in 1774, and painted portraits of the king and queen. He painted relatively simple landscapes and is credited (along with Richard Wilson) as the originator of the 18th century British landscape school. He painted quickly and his later pictures are characterised by a light palette and easy strokes. He preferred landscapes to portraits. His liking for landscapes is shown in the way he merged figures of the portraits with the scenes behind them. Gainsborough worked more from observations of nature and of human nature than from application of formal academic rules. The poetic sensibility of his paintings caused Constable to say, ‘On looking at them, we find tears in our eyes and know not what brings them.’ The paints (pictured) will undergo a scientific test to date them and to see if it's plausible that they¿re Gainsborough's. Once the tests have been completed and the paints returned to Sudbury they will become part of an exhibition next year and a conference about Gainsborough and contemporary artists. Even if it turns out that the bladders did not belong to the ‘son of Suffolk’ they will still be a valuable addition to the museum’s collection. 'To have 19 surviving is a very rare thing - They are really important,’ Mr Bills said. Once the scientific tests have been completed to establish the paints' former owner, they will become part of an exhibition next year and a conference about Gainsborough and contemporary artists .","The ‘bladders’ of paint spent hundreds of .

Taking action: Julie Gayet has filed a complaint against the photographer who snapped President Hollande outside her flat . The photographer who exposed Francois Hollande’s secret affair with an actress is potentially facing criminal charges following a complaint by the President’s lover. Sebastien Valiela, a veteran media operator with high-powered contacts in France’s political establishment, is suspected of compromising the privacy of 41-year-old actress Julie Gayet. Valiela, who took the photographs of Hollande meeting Ms Gayet is being questioned by police today as part of a criminal enquiry into the scandal. ‘He’s been taken in for questioning,’ said a police source, who said the BRDP, a specialist brigade which examines crimes against individuals, was leading the enquiry. But the involvement of the police in what is now widely viewed as a matter of huge public interest is being viewed by many as an attack on press freedom. Mr Hollande, 59, regularly met his younger lover without bodyguards in a Paris apartment rented by a woman linked to the Corsican mafia. ‘From the moment he was in the apartment his security detail left,’ said Mr Valiela, saying an attack on the Socialist head of state would have been easy. Ms Gayet’s long relationship with Mr Hollande led to his former girlfriend, 49-year-old Valerie Trierweiler, losing her title as first lady of France after Mr Hollande announced their split in an 18 word statement. Ms Trierweiler felt so humiliated by photos exposing the scandal that she smashed up furniture in the Elysee Palace before checking herself into hospital for eight days. After Mr Valiela's photos of Hollande meeting Ms Gayet were published by French Closer, his partner Valerie Trierweiler was to shocked she was hospitalised . A court in Nanterre, the Paris suburb, has opened an enquiry into the publication of images showing Mr Hollande visiting his love nest on the back of a moped while wearing a crash helmet as a disguise. Ms Gayet, who had continually denied having an affair with Mr Hollande – including on national TV and on the radio – is determined to see those who exposed it punished. Her civil claim against Closer magazine, which first published the pictures, has seen her claiming the equivalent of just over 40,000 pounds in damages and interest. The editor of a publication found guilty of invasion of privacy under criminal law faces a possible one year sentence and a fine of up to 40,000 pounds. Mr Hollande said earlier this year that it would be unfair for the President, who has immunity from prosecution, to take legal action against someone else.","Photographer may face criminal charges over photos that exposed affair .

Having hundreds of Facebook friends may seem like the ultimate sign of popularity and happiness, yet it could actually suggest the opposite. Researchers from Maine compared personality traits to levels of happiness among more than 16,000 people over a four-year period. People listed as extroverted at the start of the study gradually saw an increase in wellbeing, but as this wellbeing and happiness increased, the same participants became more introverted and withdrawn. Researchers compared personality traits to levels of well-being in 16,367 participants. People who were more outgoing at the start of the four-year study saw increased levels of happiness. Yet as this happiness increased, the outgoing participants became more introverted, and withdrawn . A 2012 study by Wake Forest University . found introverts experience greater happiness when they . act more extroverted. While follow-up studies found that introverts have an . exaggerated fear of embarrassment from acting like an extrovert. Researchers from Ohio recently found that a profile photo on Facebook tells friends, or potential friends, all they need to know to form an impression of someone and virtually no words are necessary. In one experiment, college students who viewed a Facebook photo of a fellow student having fun with friends rated that person as extroverted - even if his profile said he was 'not a big people-person.' The only exception is when a photo is out of the ordinary or shows someone in a negative light. In that case, people do use profile text to help interpret what kind of person is shown in the profile. This suggests having lots of friends can ultimately make people less sociable, and can increase sadness - the opposite of what the researchers expected. Lead author Professor Christopher Soto added this could be because the participants felt they no longer needed to seek out new relationships. Professor Soto, from Colby College, analysed personality traits and well-being among 16,367 participants who were surveyed repeatedly over four years. He was able to examine which aspects of personality at the start of the study predicted which patterns of well-being later on, and whether wellbeing at the start was linked to later personality changes. The results showed that people 'who were initially extraverted, agreeable, conscientious, and emotionally stable subsequently increased in well-being.' But they also revealed that people with high levels of well-being to begin with 'subsequently became more agreeable, conscientious, emotionally stable, and introverted.' Increased introversion for happy people was the opposite of what had been expected because higher extraversion usually leads to greater future happiness. The findings suggests having lots of friends in real-life, and on social networks such as Facebook, can ultimately make people less sociable, and increase sadness. The study claims this could be because the participants felt they no longer needed to seek out new relationships . It suggests that the influence of personality on well-being was ‘somewhat stronger’ than well-being on personality, yet both were significant when forming relationships. Links observed in the study were also likely to grow stronger over longer periods, Professor Soto suggested. ‘Even small changes to an individual’s personality traits or subjective well-being can have important consequences for the course of his or her life,’ he said. ‘These findings challenge the common assumption that associations of personality traits with subjective well-being are entirely, or almost entirely, due to trait influences on well-being,’ Professor Soto concluded. The study was published in the Journal of Personality.","Researchers from Maine compared personality traits to levels of well-being .

At just eight weeks old, tiny Willow Turner was fighting for her life with a rare liver condition. And just six months later, her parents were given the heartbreaking news that she would die if she didn’t get a transplant. But after battling from the brink of death several times, and thanks to her uncle Tarron Thomas who donated part of his liver, she is now thriving. Willow Turner was fighting for her life with a rare liver condition until her uncle, Tarron Thomas, donated part of his liver to her . Willow and Mr Thomas will end up having full-sized livers due to the organ's remarkable ability to regenerate itself. Both the transplanted section and the remaining section of the donor's liver are able to regrow into a normal-sized liver. Willow's mother, Becky Leather, 24, said: 'Willow would not have survived without a new liver. 'Everything she does is down to Tarron, I can’t thank him enough. I don’t think she would be here now if it wasn’t for him. 'From being at the hospital all that time, it’s wonderful to be home as a family. It’s nice to see Willow playing - I never thought that would happen.' Mr Thomas, who is Ms Leathers' brother, said: 'I didn’t think twice when I heard they were looking for . family members as potential donors. 'I wasn’t nervous beforehand - I . think my mum and Becky were more nervous than me, I was just thinking . about Willow. I think I will hold it over her when she’s older and she’s . being naughty, mind!' Willow had biliary atresia - a rare liver disease which affects one in 16,000 newborns . The type of transplant Willow had is called a living donor liver transplant. This is where a section of liver is removed from a living donor – because the liver can regenerate itself. This means both the transplanted section and the remaining section of the donor's liver are able to regrow into a normal-sized liver. Within six weeks of donating part of his liver, Mr Thomas's liver had grown back to its original size. Willow was born after a normal pregnancy on June 22, 2012. 'When she came out she was perfect and everything was normal at first,' said Ms Leather, who lives with partner Marc Turner, 39, in Skelton, North Yorkshire. 'She was a bit jaundiced and her eyes were yellow, but we were told it was nothing to worry about. 'At eight weeks old she was weighed and they said she shouldn’t still be yellow, so we were told to take her to hospital.' Medics at Middlesbrough’s James Cook University Hospital ran a series of blood tests. The family was then told the devastating . news that Willow had biliary atresia - a rare liver disease which . affects one in 16,000 newborns. She was rushed to Leeds General . Infirmary and underwent a nine-and-a-half hour operation as surgeons . tried to reconstruct the tract by which bile is secreted by the liver. Mother-of-six Ms Leather said: 'She went down at midday and I saw her again at 9.30pm. Last summer MR Thomas underwent his operation at St James¿ University Hospital in Leeds - 20 minutes away from Leeds General Infirmary where Willow was operated on . 'It was horrendous - my tiny eight-week-old baby had a massive scar across her belly and a big breathing tube.' Willow stayed in hospital for two weeks before she was allowed home, but sadly the procedure did not work. 'At eight months old, she was only 12lbs, she was absolutely tiny,' says Ms Leather. 'She had a feeding tube but nothing worked.' Doctors then decided she needed to go on the transplant list. Several members of her family put themselves forward to see if they were suitable donors and in May 2013, Mr Thomas was confirmed as a match. He underwent his op at St James’ University Hospital in Leeds - 20 minutes away from Leeds General Infirmary where Willow was operated on. The 23-year-old donated part of his liver and spent five days in hospital recovering.

After another two weeks in hospital, Willow was finally allowed home. Willow, who is on five types of medication including anti-rejection drugs and steroids, now has to have regular check-ups. And though she is small for her age and has some development delays, the 20-month-old is on the mend - although there is always chance she will reject her new liver. Despite this worry, her mother said: 'She only weighs 16lbs and can’t walk yet, but she is so happy and smiley, she hardly ever cries. She added: 'The medical team at Leeds were absolutely brilliant.

Humans might be wowing the world with their icy stunts and blistering speed on snow at the Winter Olympics. But Britain’s only arctic animal is perfectly built for racing down snowy slopes and leaping long distances, without any expensive sporting equipment. The hardy mountain hare is a natural athlete native to Scotland and is built to cope with cold weather. Alert: Britain's only arctic animal - the mountain hare (pictured) - is perfectly built for racing down snowy slopes and leaping long distances . The mountain hare (Lepus timidus) is adapted to polar and mountainous habitats. It lives in the Scottish Highlands and England's Peak District in the UK. It can reach 65cm in length and can weigh up to 5.3kg. In the summer, the mountain hare has a brown coat but in preparation for winter it moults into a white pelage. However, its tail stays white all year round, distinguishing the species from the European hare. Most active in the evening and at night, mountain hares rest with their backs to the wind, sheltered by rocks and heather in the day time. Some wildlife experts are concerned that as global warming reduces the amount of snowfall in parts of the UK, the survival of mountain hares could be threatened as they risk being exposed in the wrong colour coat. They are preyed upon by foxes, stoats, birds of prey and cats. The animals live in arctic conditions in countries from Scandinavia to eastern Siberia, as well as in Britain. In addition to powerful legs which allow them to leap long distances and race across snowy slopes, mountain hares have the ability to turn their fur white during colder months to blend into their surroundings and avoid predators. Photographer Tim Stenton, 49, who regularly travels to Scotland to take wildlife pictures, spent two days in the Highlands photographing the hares. ‘It was incredible to be so close to these amazing creatures and watch them go about their business,’ he said. ‘To avoid predators they have learned a . trick of standing completely still for long periods of time - eagles . can't spot motionless prey. ‘Then, suddenly, they will run away . really fast. They take off, getting air as they leap over the hillsides - . this is the best of Britain's animal winter Olympians,’ he added.

Earlier this month, Mr Stenton, from Wirksworth in Derbyshire spent between four and five hours a day photographing the hares. Snow white: The hares have the ability to turn their fur white during colder months which allows them to blend into the environment and avoid predators . ‘It was a great experience. I was surrounded by some of the most beautiful countryside in the world. The Scottish Highlands look incredible covered in the recent snow,’ he said. ‘I have never followed hares around before and I now think they are fascinating creatures. They are not hard to photograph once you know where they are.’ He added. Ben Hoare of BBC Wildlife magazine, said: ‘Mountain hares are Britain's only truly arctic mammal. They are unbelievably tough animals and thrive on our wildest mountainsides even in the depths of winter. Speedy: Some species of hares can reach top speeds of 45mph - roughly equivalent to the average course speed for an Olympic downhill skier.  They can also leap three metres in a single bound . Secretive: The hares need this to blend in with their surroundings because their main enemy - the golden eagle - has eyesight up to eight times sharper than a human's and can spot its dinner from hundreds of metres away . ‘They're brilliant escape artists, moulting into pure white coats to blend in with the snow. When they hunker down against the ground, only their black ear tips give them away. In spring when the snow and ice melts, they grow back their brown coats. ‘The hares really do need this amazing camouflage because their main enemy - the golden eagle - has eyesight up to eight times sharper than ours and can spot its dinner from hundreds of metres away.’ Mountain hares are native to Britain - unlike brown hares in the lowlands, which the Romans probably brought here. But you'll have to go to the Scottish Highlands or England's Peak District to see them.’ Hardy: Mountain hares are Britain's only truly arctic mammal.

Ministers have promised millions in taxpayers’ money to help people end their marriages more easily. The cash will subsidise mediation services, designed to allow couples to negotiate how to divide their property and look after their children. To mark ‘divorce day’, family justice minister Lord McNally pledged an extra £10million for the services, saying they offer ‘a quicker and simpler approach which brings better outcomes’ for families. Divorce day: The pressure of the holiday season results in an annual peak of couples contacting divorce lawyers and thanks to the new £10million, the process should be quicker than ever . Divorce day is the name given by lawyers to the first working day in January, when approaches to legal firms by disenchanted couples are usually at their highest. The Ministry of Justice said on average the extra cash means that a divorce will last a quarter of the time and save £3,500 for husbands and wives claiming legal aid to pay for lawyers. Whitehall calculations say a mediated . divorce funded by the state costs £500 as opposed to £4,000 for one . argued in the courts, and that a mediated split takes 110 days rather . than the 435 days for contested divorces. Lord . McNally said mediation avoided ‘traumatic’ courtroom struggles, adding: . ‘All too often money is wasted on hearings that can take far too long . to resolve.’ Speeding things up: A mediated divorce tends to finish within four months, a quarter of the time of a non-mediated split . The extra money means mediation will be subsidised to the tune of £25million this year. Divorce rates are at their lowest . level since the 1970s, but ministers have long been pressing the case . for mediation on the grounds that it saves large sums of public money in . the courts and in benefit payments. Happy divorcing: Family justice minister Lord McNally said mediation services brings better outcomes . Politicians also say that avoiding conflict helps families overcome the impact of divorce on families. However, mediation has proved unpopular with most divorcing couples. The last Tory government tried to encourage divorce through mediation with its Family Law Act, which would have brought in fault-free divorce in all cases, and which required all parting married couples to attend at least an introductory meeting about mediation. Few couples showed interest and trials showed the new law to be unworkable. Labour later repealed the legislation. Critics of mediation say it favours the stronger and most outspoken spouse and that it makes divorce too easy. Lawyers say that last year approaches from husbands and wives about divorce went up by a quarter in early January. John Nicholson of the Irwin Mitchell law firm said: ‘Reasons for divorce vary widely but there seems to be a consensus that there is a feeling of New Year, new start for many people and that is why they talk to lawyers in January. ‘Whether people have had a turbulent Christmas period, have been planning a break-up for months or perhaps older couples growing apart due to empty-nest syndrome, January often brings the promise of a fresh life away from whatever problems they may have faced before.’","Family justice minister Lord McNally promised £10m to improve process .

He is held up as one of the best examples of a perfect man, and one of the most recognisable sketches in the world. But now the iconic Vitruvian man, drawn by Leonardo da Vinci in 1490, has been revealed as just being human after all. Researchers believe an unusual lump above his groin reveals the model was suffering for a severe hernia - and it might even have killed him. Vitruvian Man by Leonardo da Vinci: Experts say a bulge in the groin area reveals the model suffered a severe hernia - and it the model was a corpse, could have been the cause of  death . The drawing, which is in pen and ink on paper, depicts a male figure in two superimposed positions with his arms and legs apart and simultaneously inscribed in a circle and square. The drawing and text are sometimes called the Canon of Proportions or, less often, Proportions of Man. It is kept in the Gabinetto dei disegni e stampe of the Gallerie dell'Accademia, in Venice, Italy, under reference 228. Like most works on paper, it is displayed to the public only occasionally. The drawing is based on the correlations of ideal human proportions with geometry described by the ancient Roman architect Vitruvius in Book III of his treatise De Architectura, which da Vinci obsessed over. The image is a perfectly drawn circle on top of a square, with a naked man inside. Many have taken the model, known as Vitruvian man, to be the 'perfect' man. However, Hutan Ashrafian, a lecturer at Imperial College London, believes in fact the model was suffering from a major medical condition. He believes a bulge slightly above the left side of the groin is an inguinal hernia. Caused by the the protrusion of abdominal-cavity contents through the inguinal canal, they are found in 27% of men, and 3% of women. 'On studying the drawing, one can observe that the left inguinal region of Vitruvian Man demonstrates a spherical fullness above his groin that is consistent with ove and medial to the pubic tubercle,' he wrote in a letter to the journal Hernia. 'This corresponds to the classical manifestation of an inguinal hernia in Leonardo's depiction of the human form.' Ashrafian says that doctors at the time would have been aware of the condition. 'Knowledge of inguinal hernias was present during the renaissance, with physician s and surgeons such as Antonio Benivieni describing several types of of hernia in Florence at the time,' he wrote. 'Vitruvian man may therefore have been modelled on a living or cadaveric individuial who had suffered from an asymptomatic left inguinal hernia, or who may have died from the complications of such hernias by means in incarceration of strangulation.' The image is based on the correlations of ideal human proportions with geometry described by the ancient Roman architect Vitruvius in Book III of his treatise De Architectura, which da Vinci obsessed over. The transcript of the famous Treatise on Painting by Leonardo da Vinci. Researchers now believe one of his most famous models suffered a serious medical condition . In Book III of his treatise De Architectura, Vitruvius wrote: . 'For if a man be placed flat on his back, with his hands and feet extended, and a pair of compasses centered at his navel, the fingers and toes of his two hands and feet will touch the circumference of a circle described therefrom. 'And just as the human body yields a circular outline, so too a square figure may be found from it.' Leonardo believed humankind represented a microcosm of the universe, and believed this images showed that. He wrote in a notebook entry dated to around 1492: 'By the ancients man has been called the world in miniature; and certainly this name is well bestowed, because, inasmuch as man is composed of earth, water, air and fire, his body resembles that of the earth.' Other experts agree with Ashrafian, including Michael Rosen, director of the Comprehensive Hernia Center at University Hospitals Case Medical Center. 'If it isn’t a hernia,' Rosen told Slate, 'then I really have no idea what it would be.'","Image was created by Da Vinci to show the perfect human proportions .

The Baftas last night saw an impressive array of leading ladies squeezed into the slinkiest of designer dresses. Many looked as though they’d been dieting for months to iron out the creases. But, as I’ve discovered, looks can be deceiving. A revolutionary treatment that looks like a cling film body wrap claims to trim or ‘melt’ up to six inches of fat from your bottom, hips and tummy within an hour. Too good to be true? Most possibly. But as a busy mother, I’m up for giving anything a go. Since having my son Mckenzie, six, I’ve yo-yo’d from a size 14 back to a ten — my pre-baby size. It's a wrap: Kathryn Blundell lost an impressive five inches after her unusual treatment . Today, I’m a large size 12 after an over-indulgent winter. It makes me unhappy — I have a dressing room full of beautiful dresses I can’t wear. So, with renewed motivation, I find myself in the hands of Vicky Kerrigan, a beauty therapist who performs the Shrinking Violet treatment. I wince when I hear the price — £55 just to be wrapped in cling film? But it’s far cheaper than liposuction and I’m desperate to get into a nice frock for the weekend, plus the treatment is available nationwide in spa and beauty clinics. It involves applying an oil-based solution to exfoliated skin, then being wrapped tightly in a heat-inducing cling film-type material for an hour. As well as reducing fat, the makers claim it can also improve the look of cellulite and stretchmarks. How? Well, apparently the mix of essential oils used in the solution includes juniper, lavender and cypress. They aid phosphatidylcholine — a chemical substance that triggers lipolysis, the process of breaking down certain fats from cells so they can be processed by the liver. The treatment is popular with women who are looking to get into a tight frock for a special event. Vicky says all her clients have lost at least  some fat. Indeed, one apparently lost an astonishing 14 in after just three treatments. It starts with a three-day liver cleanse, where alcohol, caffeine and fatty and processed foods are forbidden. One could be forgiven for wondering whether it’s this diet, rather than the wrap, that gives the ‘miraculous’ results. Beyonce shocked and amazed everyone earlier this year after losing weight but keeping her curves through a specific exercise programme created by her personal trainer . But the theory is that as the liver will need to process the fat released from cells during the treatment, it needs to be in as good a shape as possible. The more fat your liver can deal with, the more inches you’ll lose, I’m told. I also have to up my water intake — according to Vicky, if I’m dehydrated, cells could retain fluid, which make it unlikely that I’ll see any results. I have to stick with this strict diet plan for three days after the  treatment as the fat loss  will continue. On the day of the treatment, Vicky measures 13 points on my body including my upper arms, waist and calves. I then lie face-down on the bed while she massages in  the oily solution, starting  with my legs before moving up to the arms. Oiled up, it’s time to wrap. I feel a bit like a marinated chicken waiting to be cooked. I stand up so Vicky can wrap me up using her giant  roll of film. This is said to create a  barrier around the treatment area. The heat from being wrapped in the film also helps open your pores so the oil is fully absorbed. While I look and feel as though I’ve been wrapped in bog-standard supermarket cling film, the wrap is actually made from a plant-based material. It’s tight, but not uncomfortably so. I itch a little, which is normal. I can see why this treatment might not be suitable for people who suffer with claustrophobia. Transformed: Josie Gibson lost 6 stone in a year and has since released work out DVDs and a book . I’m then covered with a light plastic sheet and fluffy duvet. It all begins to feel rather relaxing. Surely sweating out water must be the secret, as with some other wraps? ‘No, you might be warm, but I make sure you don’t sweat. In fact, we want you to keep drinking before, during and after the treatment to help your liver,’ says Vicky. True to her word, she checks my temperature throughout and constantly offers me sips of water. At the end of the hour, the duvet is peeled back and I’m cut free from the wrap. Now it’s time to be measured again. Startlingly, I’ve lost 0.2 in off each calf and my arms, 0.4 in off my waist and 1 in off my hips. My tummy and — bizarrely — my right knee have stayed the same, though my left knee has dropped 0.2 in. I’ve lost 0.6 in from each upper thigh, and 0.4 in each for the lower thighs. That’s almost 5 in in total, which is at the upper end of the average loss. I’m elated! And my skin looks and feels great. The trick is to see if the inch loss continues, so I measure myself again 24, 36 and 60 hours later, trying to be as accurate as possible. Cling film was invented as a waterproof coating for planes in World War II . While I expect my measurements to go back to normal virtually immediately, I’m delighted to find that after 60 hours there is still a difference compared to before the cling film wrap. I’ve still lost 1.2 in off my hips, 0.6 in off my lower thighs and 0.2 in off my upper thighs — a total loss of 2 in. A few more days later and those inches still haven’t gone back on. I can’t help but think this is the perfect quick-fix  weight-loss trick, ideal to get into that tight party dress for the weekend. Not bad for an hour in bed!

While most women dream of arriving for the biggest day of their lives in a vintage car or horse-drawn carriage groom Zheng Fu, 37, had other plans for when he wed Yi Yang, 35, in China. The groom said he had always been fascinated by the love story of the poor cowherd Niulang from ancient mythology and wanted it to feature in the ceremony.

Crime scenes can be notoriously difficult to examine without disturbing the evidence, yet one police service in Australia has come up with a novel solution. Officers from Queensland are using a handheld 3D scanner to perfectly record computer models of indoor and outdoor scenes of crime. Called Zebedee, because of the way it moves like its namesake in The Magic Roundabout, the scanner has previously been used to produce models of famous landmarks and shipwrecks, yet this is the first time the technology has been used to fight crime. Scroll down for video . Zebedee works by emitting laser beams while rotating around a spring that continuously scans the environment. This converts 2D measurements into a 3D field of view. Using data collected by the scanner, police in Queensland have been able to quickly recreate indoor scenes, like the one pictured, on a computer .

Using data collected by the scanner, police investigators can quickly recreate the scene on a computer in 3D. They . can locate and tag evidence, pinpoint particular areas of interest and . rotate the room or landscape to view it from any angle. 'The benefits of [Zebedee] will reduce interference at a scene, save time and allow access to previously hard to reach areas such as step declines and bushland,â€™ said Queensland Police Service Commissioner Ian Stewart. 'This cutting edge technology is allowing us to adapt to a new environment of ongoing change and improvement.' Crime scenes are renowned for being difficult to investigate due to the delicate nature of preserving evidence. Equally, outdoor crime scenes including dense forests, caves, or other vast areas can be time consuming to examine thoroughly. Using Zebedee, also known as ZEB1, . police can now easily access these hard to reach places and map confined . spaces where it may be difficult to set up bulky camera equipment and . tripods.

Nominees: Jessie, Radley, Molls, Velvet and Molly (left to right) have been named as finalists for the Friends For Life award at this year's Crufts . Prized: The award will be presented on Sunday March 9, the final night of Crufts, with (left to right) Radley, Molls, Jessie (behind), Velvet and Molly all contenders . Cocker spaniel Molls has transformed the life of her 11-year-old owner after giving him confidence and enabling him to play football. Molls was initially only the family’s pet until Steven Courtney noticed she showed an interest when he was hypo after being diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at the age of three. Molls has been specially trained by the Medical Detection Dog charity to detect when Steven’s blood sugar levels rise or fall. Boy's best friend: Cocker spaniel Molls, who has transformed the life of 11-year-old Steven Courtney, is among the five dogs nominated for the Crufts Friends For Life award . Caring: Molls was initially only the family¿s pet until Steven noticed she showed an interest when he was hypo after being diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at the age of three . Pals: Molls is trained to detect when Steven's blood sugar levels rise or fall . Steven’s mother, Serena Courtney, 40, said the family heard about the charity's work after a talk at their dog training club at the end of 2010 and decided to seek training for Molls to support Steven. Steven, from Bicester, Oxfordshire, explained how Molls changed his life. 'She’s helped me be more confident because I’m not worrying about my diabetes,' he said. His mother said Molls brought relief and support for the family. Confidence: Steven said Molls had made him worry less about his diabetes . Caring: Steven's mother Serena said Molls brought relief and support for the family . Amazing: Molls can pick up on rapid changes in Steven before members of his family . 'It was so much more stressful before. I was just desperately trying to see what was going to happen to Steven. Obviously we wanted to try and keep his levels as good as we can. 'It’s amazing what Molls has done. She can tell what’s wrong when we can’t and she’s alert in the night which is a big thing for us. She also picks up rapid changes when Steven plays football and games don’t get interrupted so much!' Molls is joined by four other hero dogs who will compete in the public vote for the Friends for Life award at Crufts 2014. Guide dog Radley helped a former lance corporal find love and become a father. Konrad Galen-Bisping did not want to leave his home after being attacked with a pick-axe to his head during training for Iraq more than 10 years ago. The former section commander from Carmarthenshire, Wales, was blinded by the assault committed by a fellow soldier and left him with memory problems. Vision: Also on the shortlist is Radley, a guide dog, who helped a former lance corporal Konrad Galen-Bisping from Carmarthenshire find love and become a father after he was blinded in an assault . Bond: Mr Galen-Bisping with Radley . Following the attack which ended his promising army career, Mr Galen-Bisping was taken to different hospitals including Headley Court, Surrey, a defence medical rehabilitation unit for 18 months. Before getting his guide dog, a black labrador/golden retriever cross, he did not want to leave the house. 'I had no interest in going out, I didn’t trust anybody. But then a local blind charity said I need to get a dog to which I said no but they then got me to meet someone with a guide dog. After I agreed and said I would see how it goes,' he said. And the father-of-three said the two immediately bonded. 'Radley officially became mine five years ago. I brought her home and the bond was immediate- the way he was jumping all over me, he was really excited,” he said. His first outing after returning home was to a corner shop with Radley. He said: 'We went to a corner shop and I thought, ""that was easy"". It was like a switch.' Mr Galen-Bisping continued to go out and joined a gym where he met his wife five years ago who was the manager and loved dogs. They now have three sons, Jac aged two and half, Cai aged 18-months and Sion, seven months old. He praised the dog for the new life he has. 'He got me a wife and family and he’s there for me in many ways. He knows when I’m starting to get nervous or if I feel low and he distracts me. He knows when I’m sad,' he said. Mr Galen-Bisping added: 'He has had a major impact on my life and completely turned it around. He gave me more confidence and made me realise it’s not all bad out there. He’s truly my best friend.' Assistance dog Velvet supports Lottie Wilcocks to be independent and boosts her self-confidence. Lottie, who was born with spina bifida and hydrocephalus, can only get around in a wheelchair but the aspiring Paralympic athlete has not let that stop her go far in training to race. The 12-year-old from Ripponden, West Yorkshire, attends mainstream school and said how Velvet, a black labrador, helps her with day-to-day tasks. Bond: Velvet helps Lottie Wilcocks from Ripponden in Yorkshire with her spina bifida by giving her confidence to live life to the full . 'Velvet will fetch the phone if I need to call for help, she gets my socks and she helps me get undressed,' she said. The schoolgirl who will be taking part in the Virgin Money Giving Mini London Marathon on April 13 added: 'She also keeps me company and gives me cuddles. Velvet is my best friend and I can’t imagine life without her. 'She gives me the confidence to do things that I wouldn’t be able to do without her.' Another nominee is Molly, a cocker spaniel, who has made life easier for owner, Lucy Watts, as well as giving her more confidence. Ms Watts, 20, is in a wheelchair because of a chronic and life-limiting illness, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which made life difficult until Molly came into her life. She said: 'Before we had Molly, my life was tough and I was struggling to see the point of it. But Molly’s given me a new lease of life - a reason to keep going. I don’t think I could live without her. She’d fetch help if I needed it.' Paws for thought: Lucy Watts has a rare limiting illness, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which made life difficult until spaniel Molly came into her life . The family from Benfleet, Essex got Molly when she was only a puppy and since September, Molly has been training to help the 20-year-old more with her day-to-day needs. The charity, Dog A.I.D., who help disabled owners train their dogs, is helping Molly to become an assistance dog after three stages. It came after a recommendation of the charity by a neighbour and Molly is currently at Stage 1. The final nominee is Mastiff/Great Dane cross, Jessie, who helped her owner to overcome her illnesses and her father’s death. Julie Barrett from Beer, Devon, struggled with diabetes, ME and depression but she said Jessie changed her life. 'She’s really improved my life. I was at a low point when we got her but we have helped each other,' she said. Rescued: The final nominee is Mastiff/Great Dane cross, Jessie, who helped her owner Julie Barrett to overcome her illnesses and her father's death . Rehomed: Jessie was a rescue dog who was abused by her previous owner . Jessie was a rescue dog who was abused by her previous owner and found in a shed left after her owner was sent to prison for unrelated matters. When she was found, Jessie had cigarette burns to her legs and ears and her nose had been slashed. Fortunately neighbours heard her cries and she was given a new home with Ms Barrett, 33. 'She’s so trusting and she’s an incredible dog,' she said. The award will be presented on Sunday March 9, the final night of Crufts, at the Birmingham NEC, which will be shown on Channel 4.","Dogs Jessie, Radley, Molls, Velvet and Molly are all up for the prize .

One man was killed and 77 injured after police in Papua New Guinea opened fire on rioting asylum seekers in an Australian-run detention camp last night. Thirteen people suffered serious injuries, two of which has been flown to Australia for treatment, after the the second riot this week at a detention centre on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea. Australian officials says the riot began when detainees forced their way out of the centre, but refugee advocates insist it was sparked when local residents and police stormed the facility. Scroll down for video . Deadly uproar: One person was killed and 77 injured during a second night of rioting at an Australian immigration detention centre on Papua New Guinea's Manus Island . Australian Immigration Minister Scott Morrison described the violence as the latest in a series of protests at the camp, which houses around 1,300 men from countries including Afghanistan, Sudan's Darfur region, Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, Pakistan, Somalia, and Syria. 'This is a tragedy, but this was a very dangerous situation where people decided to protest in a very violent way and to take themselves outside the center and place themselves at great risk,' he told reporters. He said one man died from head injuries as he was taken to the hospital. He would not disclose the victim's nationality, or say how he had sustained the injuries. Another person was shot and was flown to the Papua New Guinea capital Port Moresby while one man was flown to Australia for treatment of a fractured skull, he said. In all, 77 people received medical treatment including 13 who were seriously injured, he said. Criticised: UN agencies and human rights organisations have called for the camps to be closed down due to the living conditions for the refugees . Tension: The camp, pictured in July last year, houses around 1,300 men from countries including Afghanistan, Sudan's Darfur region, Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, Pakistan, Somalia, and Syria . Morrison initially said the injuries had occurred outside the camp but later said he was uncertain whether the fatal injuries had been inflicted within the camp or outside, adding that local authorities are investigating the matter. Mr Morrison said Papua New Guinea police opened fire after detainees pushed down the perimeter fence and spilled into the street around the camp. However, an Australian advocacy group said inmates claim  to have been attacked by police and local residents. Defense: Australian Immigration Minister Scott Morrison says the riot began when detainees forced their way out of the centre . Gangs of police and locals — armed with machetes, pipes, sticks and stones — had roamed from compound to compound within the camp attacking asylum seekers, Refugee Action Coalition said. This was denied by Australian officials and security firm G4S, who operates the camp. The violence followed a less serious brawl at the same facility on Sunday night that led to the arrests of eight asylum seekers and another 19 being treated for injuries.

Hitchhiker Tony Jones vanished in 1972 after walking along the Flinders Highway in Queensland. He is one of 11 people killed in mysterious circumstances on the stretch of road . The family of a hitchhiker who was killed in a 32-year-old murder mystery believes an outback 'thrill killer' could be responsible for 11 other unsolved murders along Queensland’s 800km 'highway of death'. Hitchhiker Tony Jones vanished without a trace on the night of November 3, 1982 while walking along the Flinders Highway – last seen in Anthill Creek, known as Townsville’s killing fields, about 26km out of town. But despite detectives conducting a full-scale manhunt, the killer was never caught. Over the past three decades, two coronial inquests have also been conducted in an attempt to find out what happened to the missing man. The family also hired a private investigator to no avail. But Queensland Police have today revealed they have fresh leads into the cold case, and have reopened it for investigation. The missing man’s brother, Mark Jones, said the family had invested a lot of time into trying to find links between this murder and several others along the same stretch of road. 'We’ve spent years trying to find links to unsolved murders like Tony’s,' Mr Jones, 53, of Melbourne told the Courier Mail newspaper. 'In terms of a fit, if you look at those with no apparent motive, you can find links. This could be the work of a thrill killer.' The site where the lone hitchhiker disappeared on the Flinders Highway, a remote 800km stretch of road, was the same area where police found the bodies of Mackay sisters Judith, 7, and five-year-old Susan. Both were found to have been sexually abused. Mr Jones said this latest breakthrough gives the family fresh hope. Northern Regional Crime Coordinator Cheryl Scanlon declined to comment on the likelihood of an outback serial killer. 'We are purely focused on this one cold case of Tony Jones and I don’t want to detract from our momentum,’’ Acting Superintendent Scanlon told reporters. She said several anonymous phone calls to police had revealed 'completely new’ and 'very specific leads', following serious crime and homicide detectives swooping on the outback cattle town of Hughenden, 384km west of Townsville this week. Death road: The site where the lone hitchhiker disappeared on the Flinders Highway, a remote 800km stretch of road, was the same area where police found the bodies of Mackay sisters Judith, 7, and five-year-old Susan . The body of Catherine Graham, 18, was found raped and slain on the same location in 2007. In October 1978, Karen Edwards, Gordon Twaddle and Timothy Thompson were found shot in the head near Mt Isa, about 250km west of Julia Creek. Hitchhikers Robin Hoinville-Bartram, 18, and Anita Cunningham, 19, also disappeared along the Flinders Highway several decades ago. Robin was shot twice in the head and her skeletal remains were found west of Charters Towers in July 1972. Anita was listed as missing but police believe she was killed with her friend. Those murders, too, are unsolved. A $250,000 reward still stands for Tony Jones and those with any information are asked to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.","'Thrill killer' could be behind 12 murders on so-called 'Highway of Death'

Confectionary firm Carambar has axed a long-standing joke about Formula One ace Michael Schumacher from inside its sweet wrappers. The gag, which appears in French, has been deemed to be in poor taste following the driver’s horrific skiing accident on December 29. The joke read: 'What vegetable goes very fast and laughs when cornering? Answer: Le chou marreur (Schumacher)'.

The chewy, caramel stick sweet was first created in 1954 and is famous for its silly jokes. It was seven weeks ago last Sunday that Schumacher, 45, suffered his life-threatening accident while skiing with his son in the French resort of Meribel, where he owns a chalet. He remains in intensive care as doctors try to ease him out of an artificially-induced coma. On Monday investigators announced that the inquiry into his accident had closed and ruled out any wrongdoing. Closing the case, Prosecutor Patrick Quincy, in charge of the inquiry, ruled 'no infraction by anyone has been turned up'. It was seven weeks ago last Sunday that Schumacher, 45, suffered his life-threatening accident while skiing with his son in the French resort of Meribel (file picture taken in 2004) He cleared the French ski resort of Meribel of any wrongdoing. He said the accident occurred just over 14 feet from the edge of the ski run in an off-piste area and that the resort had conformed to the French standards for marking ski runs. He said: 'No one was found to have committed any offence. The accident occurred in an off-piste area. The signage, marking, staking (marker poles in the snow) and information provided about the edge of this slope were all consistent with French standards in place.' He said the rock that caused him to lose balance and the rock on which he struck his head 'are 10.40 metres from each other and both are located at 4.50 metres from the boundary of the piste'. His decision does not, however, prevent Schumacher’s family from taking civil action.","Carambar has said joke will no longer be used on any of its future packets .

Markus Babbel has launched an attack on Arsenal ahead of Wednesday night’s Champions League clash against Bayern Munich. The former Bayern and Liverpool player accused Arsenal of being chokers, who would be 'no problem' for Bayern. Both Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Arsene Wenger had spoken in the last few days as saying that Arsenal had a better chance against Bayern than at this time last year, and that the north London side had raised their level in the last 12 months. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Arsenal training ahead of the clash with Bayern Munich . Chokers: Ex-Bayern Munich Markus Babbel has labelled Arsenal chokers ahead of the Champions League tie . Personal criticism: Babbel has been surprised by 'lazy' Lukas Podolski's (centre) progress at Arsenal . No bottle: Babbel said Arsenal are notorious for losing the big games when it really matters . Asked if he agreed that Arsenal were stronger in an interview in Munich newspaper Münchner Merkur, Babbel replied: 'No. And they’ve got a lot of injuries. If Bayern concentrate, they won’t have any problems. You see it in the Premier League: Arsenal always mess things up in big games.' The former Liverpool man also had a lot of criticism for his compatriots at Arsenal, saying that Mesut Ozil 'still needs to work on his physicality', and that he was surprised with how well Lukas Podolski had settled in the Premier League. 'I didn’t think he’d make it in England, to be honest, he was always far too lazy at Bayern and Cologne', said Babbel. Soft: Babbel criticised Mesut Ozil (right) for lacking the required physicality to excel in the Premier League . Outspoken: Babbel has been out of work since being sacked by Hoffeinheim as their manager in 2012 . Qualified praise: Babbel did however say that Per Mertesacker had shown enough fight to 'impress the British' For Arsenal’s third German star, Babbel was full of praise, albeit of a slightly backhanded nature: 'Per Mertesacker is rated very highly, because he’s fought his way into this team. His performances haven’t been amazing of late, but he fights, and that impresses the British'. Babbel is convinced, though, that even Mertesacker’s fight will not be enough to stop Bayern. He rates this Bayern side as one of the best ever, saying that Toni Kroos, Philipp Lahm and Bastian Schweinsteiger will one day be mentioned in the same breath as Franz Beckenbauer, Sepp Maier and Gerd Muller. Final preparations: Bayern train in Munich ahead of their visit to London to take on Arsenal . Star turn: Mario Gotze works out in training before Bayern's Champions League clash with Arsenal . Legacy: Babbel believes current players such as Toni Kroos (right) and Phillip Lahm can become club legends . Targets: Babbel suggested Bayern pursue a deal for Nemanja Vidic (right) over Chelsea's David Luiz (left) The former Germany international, who has a well documented love for English football and England since his time in Liverpool, also said that he would not advise Bayern sign Chelsea’s David Luiz. 'He’s a great player, and it’s good that he can play in midfield too, but if they were going to sign someone from the Premier League, I would advise them to get Nemanja Vidic. He’s cheaper.' Whether Uli Hoeness, Pep Guardiola and Co will follow his advice, though, seems unlikely. Babbel has been out of a coaching job since he was sacked by Hoffenheim in 2012. A year beforehand, he was forced to leave Hertha BSC just months after leading them to promotion, following a breakdown in relations with the club hierarchy.","Markus Babbel labels Arsenal chokers ahead of the Champions League clash with Bayern Munich .

With its own cinema, hairdressing salon and even beach huts, what looks like a plush country retreat is in fact Britain's most luxurious care home, built at a cost of £8.5million. The state-of-the-art complex with 60 en-suite bedrooms features a town square, and when outside residents can relax in beach huts, in specially-themed gardens or underneath gazebos. However, the luxury comes at a cost with weekly fees start at £980 for residential care at Linden House, although this does include everything a resident may need - including styling by the full-time hairdresser. Caring: Built at a cost of £8.5million and boasting its own cinema, Linden House in Lymington, Hampshire stakes a claim to be Britain's most luxurious care home . Plush: A luxuriously-appointed recption area could be the lobby of a swanky country hotel . Great outdoors: Outside residents can relax in beach huts, in specially-themed gardens or underneath gazebos . The new complex in Lymington, Hampshire, aims to provide the perfect environment for people living with dementia. Navigational aids such as colour-coded doors help the home’s residents find their way around the three-storey care home. Meanwhile, Linden Square - the home’s internal 'outside space' - reflects the town’s historic past and helps those with dementia stimulate their memory. In fact, the entrance leads through a shop-themed area and additional spaces reflect landscapes and features in and around Lymington. Relaxing: The care home boasts its own hairdessing salon, complete with a full-time stylist . Sensory: The entrance leads through a shop-themed area and additional spaces reflect landscapes and features in and around Lymington which can help people with dementia stimulate their memory . Owned and run by Lymington-based Colten Care, Linden House features four house groups of 15 residents each and has created 100 jobs. The home also boasts three hotel suites which are free of charge for relatives who have travelled to visit residents. Manager Jackie Hampton said: 'Colten already provides three dementia-specific care homes, giving us a huge body of knowledge about the different dementia journeys people can take. 'Living in small, friendly groups gives residents the chance to continue practical skills and retain their spirit of independence for as long as possible.' Well-travelled: The home's cafe area is themed around global travels and offers residents a place to take afternoon tea . Kitted out: Some en suite rooms come with hydrotherapy spa baths . The home is built on the site of an earlier care home that was closed by Hampshire County Council. Inside, there is an activities room and a cafe offering afternoon tea, as well as a family kitchen for the resident’s relatives. The cost of residential care can vary hugely by location and depends on whether you require nursing care, which your care needs assessment will determine. If you do require nursing care this will increase your care home costs considerably. It is also important to bear in mind that although you may not need nursing care now, this could change in the future. On average you can expect to pay more than £27,200 a year in residential care costs which can rise to over £37,500 a year if nursing care is necessary. On average care home fees cost around £26,312 in the east midlands, £24,336 in the north west and £31,000 in London. In the south of England, care home prices average at around £30,000 a year but Linden House in Hampshire will set you back around £47,040 a year and that is a starting figure. Residents can also take advantage of the outside boules area amongst the home’s beautifully-manicured gardens,or practice their golf on Linden House's putting green. The rooms are large and spacious with high quality finishes throughout and some en-suite rooms come with hydrotherapy spa baths. The purpose-built home reflects the latest thinking in dementia care and memory loss. Prospective . residents are subject to a pre-admission assessment, and fees are based . on a person's needs, although they are all-inclusive. The . New Forest, where the home is situated, is a popular retirement area . where dementia cases are expected to rise 43 per cent in the next 20 . years. Colten Care’s chief . executive Mark Aitchison said: 'We’re a family-run group, determined to . set the highest standards in all aspects of care. 'Linden . House incorporates the latest therapeutic approaches and facilities for . dementia care, all within an elegant, beautifully designed building.' Spacious: One of the home's 60 en-suite bedrooms . Music room: A piano in one of the home's lounge areas provides residents with some musical entertainment . Linden Square, an internal 'outside' space has been designed to look like a town square to stimulate the memory of people with dementia. Studies have shown that nostalgic scenes, such as the Square, or images can trigger happy memories in people with diseases such as Alzheimer's. Recalling instances from a person's long-term memories can help carers and loved ones to engage with people with dementia in a positive way, as well as improving the quality of life for the 800,000 people living with dementia in the UK. Many people with dementia are also encouraged to take part in art or musical projects as part of their cognitive therapy, and experts believe that such activities can help a person reconnect with themselves as well as their carers and family, and even slow their decline.

Silvano Vinceti is conducting DNA test on a skeleton found in the Sant'Orsola convent near Florence . Italian art detectives are a step closer to identifying the lady behind Mona Lisa’s enigmatic smile. DNA tests are underway on bones that may belong to a Florentine noblewoman, named Lisa Gherardini, who is widely believed to be the model for Leonardo da Vinci’s painting. Historian Silvano Vinceti has taken samples from a skeleton in Sant’Orsola convent near Florence and is comparing them to DNA from the bones of some of Gherardini's confirmed relatives. If a DNA match is made, Professor Vinceti will make a 3D reconstruction of Gherardini's face from the skull, as well as details in da Vinci’s Mona Lisa painting. ‘If we don’t find her, art historians can continue to speculate about who the model really was,’ Professor Vinceti told the Wall Street Journal. The results from the analysis should be ready by May or June, he said. The Florentine family tomb was opened up in August last year for the first time in centuries in a bid to identify the model in da Vinci's painting. Lisa Gherardini is thought to have posed for the painting between 1503 and 1506.

Some have argued the painting is a self-portrait of the artist, or one of his favourite male lovers in disguise, the evidence they say is the fact Da Vinci kept it with him until his death in Amboise, France in 1519. The most curious theories have been provided by medical experts turned Renaissance art sleuths. One theory was that the Mona Lisa's mouth is clamped firmly shut because she was undergoing mercury treatment for syphilis which turned her teeth black. An American dentist has claimed that the tight-lipped expression was typical of people who have lost their front teeth, while a Danish doctor was convinced she suffered from congenital palsy which affected the left side of her face and this is why her hands are overly large. ‘With the medical techniques that are available today we could rebuild her physique and recreate the famous pose,’ said Leonardo Da Vinci expert Professor Carlo Pedretti.

However, 36-year-old Jennifer Welter hopes signing with the Texas Revolution, a professional indoor team, will inspire other girls to play the sport. The Revolution recently tried out 5-foot-2, 130-pound, Welter during a game against the North Texas Crunch on Saturday - making her the first woman to play a professional football game in a position other than placeholder or place-kicker. 'I've thought of all the reasons why I might be the wrong person to do . this. ""You're too small, you're too this, you're too that,""' she told . the Dallas Morning News.

She will find out today if she the cut today. But her efforts to join the Revolution may have been hindered by her performance in Saturday's game as she didn't score one touchdown and was seriously tackled on several attempts. Welter made it clear to the other team that she should be treated like any other player, and not to go easy on her. After taking a particularly hard hit from 6-foot-4, 245-pound lineman Cedric Hearvey, Welter shot back with: 'Is that all you got?' 'They were getting all alive, and I had to say something. I didn't want them to think I was intimidated,' Welter said. Rolling with the punches: Welter didn't make any touchdowns and took several hits from linemen nearly twice her weight. During one play she was shoved and flew several feet to the ground . Trying: Welter had a handful of unsuccessful touchdown attempts during Saturday's game . Good sport: Welter hugs it out with rival team member Cedric Hearvey who tackled her during the game . Breaking gender norms: Welter said she wanted to join the team not as an advocate for women playing against men but to prove that women are just as passionate about the sport . Welter went on to attempt several other unsuccessful touchdowns while the Crunch refused to hold back. At first, Hearvey didn't like having to tackle Welter and at one point even called out to the coaches on the sideline to take her out 'because this doesn't feel right'. 'Honestly it was very weird,' Hearvey said after the game. 'Part of me wanted to let her score, but part of me had a job. So I was like, ""Can ya'll take her out?""' But Hearvey has nothing but positive feelings towards Welter. 'Honestly, I really have a lot of respect for that lady over there,' he said. Crossing her fingers: Welter hasn't officially made the team yet. The Revolution will announce their final season roster on Wednesday . Veteran: Welter has been playing football since 2004 as a member of the Dallas Diamonds, which competes in the Women's Football Alliance (pictured in blue tackling) Team owner Tommy Benizio says he would like to see her end up on the team, in some capacity. 'Whether it's on the field or off the field, I hope she will become part of the Revolution family for the long term,' Benizio told Fox Sports.

Next she was asked who the FA Cup holders were. A slightly anxious-looking Mrs Grant said: ‘Come on, help,’ before replying: ‘Manchester United because it’s my favourite club.’ Most football fans would know if their team had won such a coveted trophy.

Perhaps . taking pity on her, the presenter asked her when the football team in . her constituency, Maidstone United, had left the football league. Mrs Grant conceded: ‘These are hard questions’ before adding ‘last year’. The correct answer was 1992. Finally, she was asked which Paralympian had won the most gold medals at London 2012.

Mrs Grant said: ‘I wasn’t told there was going to be a quiz thrown in . at the end of an interview. If I’d known I would have done some proper . revision. ‘My sports pub quiz knowledge may not . be encyclopaedic but I completely understand the positive impact that . participating in sport has on people’s lives.’ Last . month, the MP for Maidstone and The Weald said that sport was in her .

One of the senior health officials accused of ordering the deletion of a damning report in care at a baby unit today denied leading a cover-up. Jill Finney, the former deputy chief executive of the Care Quality Commission, insisted that a crucial meeting to discuss a study into Morecambe Foundation Trust did not demand it be destroyed. The claim that the Ms Finney told an official to 'read my lips' and delete the report proved one of the most explosive to emerge from an investigation into care failings. Up to 16 babies and two mothers are feared to have died between 2001 and 2012 due to poor care at the maternity unit at Barrow-in-Furness general hospital, part of the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay foundation trust. Despite multiple warnings about the dreadful failings at the hospital unit, a CQC report gave the trust a clean bill of health after a two-day inspection in 2010. Louise Dineley, head of regulatory risk and quality at the CQC, produced a document showing that the 2010 inspection had been seriously flawed. But she claims she was told to delete it, according to an independent report by chartered accountants Grant Thornton published last week. It said that at a meeting in March last year, Ms Jefferson said: ‘Are you kidding me? This can never be in the public domain, nor subject to a freedom of information request.' It was also claimed that Ms Finney told Ms Dineley to 'read my lips' and delete the report. But Ms Finney today insisted this was not true. She said: ‘At that meeting we reviewed the report and the report concluded that the activity that CQC had undertaken at Morecambe was satisfactory. ‘It was quite clear on reading the report that the activity was not satisfactory and the CQC should have done more. ‘So at that meeting we agreed that the report required much further work, there was not a decision at that meeting to delete the report, nor was there an instruction.’ Storm: Former CQC chief executive Cynthia Bower (left) and media manager Anna Jefferson have also faced criticism . She claims that while Ms Dineley believes that there had been an instruction to delete her report, ‘the other three individuals in that meeting do not recall that instruction’. However she admitted that the CQC had not regulated Morecambe properly. ‘The report concluded it was adequate, we in the meeting felt it was not adequate, CQC should have done more at Morecambe Bay. Failings at Morecambe Bay hospitals have 'echoes' of the Mid-Staffs care scandal, Robert Francis QC warned. The author of the damning report into neglect at the Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust, where up to 1,200 people may have died needlessly, condemned the lack of transparency. Mr Francis, pictured, warned: 'It seems to me that there are considerable echoes of what I found. 'There has been apparently a lack of candour and openness at Trust level, there was a failure of a regulator to find out that things were going wrong, and there appears, or could well have been, in many different places, a lack of openness and transparency.' He claimed there was an institutional problem with the NHS. He told BBC Radio 4: 'One of the problems with the NHS – one of its advantages, but one of its problems – is that it’s hugely complex. 'And as a result of that it has many different bits of it which have to interrelate with each other. 'And it becomes quite easy in such an organisation for matters of concern to disappear between the cracks.' ‘At the point of registration we should have done more and when it was registered as a Foundation Trust we should have exercised more concern.’ She complained that she had been subjected to a ‘media feeding frenzy’ without any notice. ‘If CQC felt that they wanted to produce a report where they named and shamed individuals in the public domain then they should have made sure that they followed a fair process,’ she said. ‘They did not follow a fair process. We made several representations to Grant Thornton about the accuracy of the way in which they were recording the information and the way in which they were beginning to treat one allegation as (an) act. ‘Grant Thornton did not reply and did not change the way in which the allegations were presented. ‘At that meeting I did no such thing and as a result of the way in which they redacted the names, what they generated was a complete media feeding frenzy. The first time I saw the final report was when I read it online on Tuesday night and by Wednesday morning the media feeding frenzy had begun.’ CQC Head of Regulatory Risk & Quality Louise Dineley, who wrote the internal review, claims she confronted senior management with her critical findings but that Ms Finney ordered it to be deleted. Cynthia Bower, then CQC chief executive, and media manager Anna Jefferson also deny any attempted cover-up at the meeting. Ms Finney suggested that a lack of sufficient resources meant it was ‘always going to be a very, very tall order’ for the CQC to do its job effectively. ‘The fact that the regulatory activity in Morecambe Bay could have been better was undoubtedly a feature of the very, very sizeable agenda CQC had to lead.’ Ministers had been warned it would be ‘challenging’ when the body was set up, she said. The new management ‘has received substantially more funding’, she said. ‘It is able to employ more professional staff then we were able to do and to recruit people who are of a higher level of seniority.’","Jill Finney rejects claim in major report that she sanctioned a cover-up .

Tony Blair warned Labour must not return to the comfort of the 1980s, opposing everything but offering no leadership . Ed Miliband was embroiled in a damaging row with Tony Blair yesterday over his kneejerk resistance to austerity and welfare cuts. The former Prime Minister warned Mr Miliband he risked reducing Labour to a party of protest, out of touch with mainstream opinion. Mr Blair insisted the Labour leader’s belief that the centre ground of British politics has shifted to the left in the wake of the financial crisis was a fantasy. In his most significant intervention in domestic politics since leaving No 10, he said Labour must get out of ‘the comfort zone’, and that people wanted a party that offered answers to problems rather than merely being a mouthpiece for anger. He also suggested Mr Miliband needed to be more realistic on issues such as the spiralling housing benefit bill, spending cuts and education reforms. He was backed by former Home Secretary David Blunkett and former Business Minister Pat McFadden. Mr Miliband, however, suggested he regarded the former Prime Minister, who won three general elections, as yesterday’s man, insisting he was not interested in ‘old solutions’. Mr Blair’s intervention comes as Mr Miliband faces growing unrest from a section of his party over his refusal to back any of the Government’s attempts to rein in the bloated welfare budget. He has previously been circumspect . about criticising Mr Miliband, but hit out in an article for the . Left-leaning New Statesman magazine. Mr Blair insisted that ‘the financial . crisis has not brought a decisive shift to the Left’ and warned that . politics was returning to that of the 1980s – with the Tories offering . fiscal responsibility and Labour simply opposing austerity measures. Labour must not become simply a . ‘repository for people’s anger’, the former Prime Minister wrote. ‘Parts . of the political landscape that had been cast in shadow for some years, . at least under New Labour and the first years of coalition government, . are illuminated in sharp relief. In an extraordinary move Labour leader Ed Miliband, pictured this week launching his local election campaign, dismissed the intervention from Mr Blair insisting the party had to 'move on' ‘The Conservative Party is back . clothing itself in the mantle of fiscal responsibility, buttressed by . moves against “benefit scroungers”, immigrants squeezing out British . workers and – of course – Labour profligacy. ‘The Labour Party is back as the party . opposing “Tory cuts”, highlighting the cruel consequences of the . Conservative policies on welfare and representing the disadvantaged and . vulnerable.’ Mr Blair said the scenario was more ‘menacing’ for his party than for the Tories. ‘They are now going to inspire . loathing on the Left. But they’re used to that,’ he said. Mr Blair's article will be seen as a damning criticism of the leadership during the 1980s of Neil Kinnock, who has been a strong backer of Mr Miliband . ‘They’re back . on the old territory of harsh reality, tough decisions, piercing the . supposed veil of idealistic fantasy that prevents the Left from . governing sensibly... ‘For Labour, the opposite is true. This scenario is more menacing than it seems.’ In an apparent swipe at Mr Miliband’s . policy vacuum,  Mr Blair warned the public wanted to ‘know where we’re . coming from because that is  a clue as to where we would go, if . elected’. Mr Miliband insisted: ‘I always take . Tony Blair very, very seriously, but... I am leading in my own way. Political parties have to move forwards not backwards, not going back to . old solutions.’ A Labour spokesman said: ‘It is by challenging old ways . of doing things, showing we have understood what we did right and wrong . during our time in office, that One Nation Labour will win back . people’s trust.’ However, Mr Blunkett said: ‘He [Mr . Blair] is right to remind us that the pendulum did not swing leftwards . and there is much to do.’ Mr McFadden said: ‘Advice from a three-times election-winning Prime Minister should always be taken seriously.’ Tory chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘Tony . Blair is right to warn that Labour aren’t a credible party of . government under Ed Miliband. 'The only plan Labour have is more of what . got us into this mess in the first place – more spending, more borrowing . and more debt.’","Tony Blair issues stark warning against retreating to 1980s comfort zone .

David Cameron was eying up what could be the world’s fast car today, in stark contrast to the mini scooter he has been using to get around London. The Prime Minister welcomed the 1,000mph Bloodhound Supersonic Car to Downing Street to promote British engineering. The jet and rocket powered vehicle, which designers hope will secure the world land speed record, was an altogether more impressive sight than Mr Cameron scooting through Regent’s Park. Speed: David Cameron talks to RAF Pilot Andy Green about the British-built Bloodhound jet-powered car in Downing Street . It emerged yesterday that Mr Cameron had been spotted using a £120 Mini Scooter to keep up with his children. He was pictured riding on the 40cm long deck in Regent’s Park on his way to lunch with Nancy and Arthur. The PM later scooted back to Number 10, according to The Sun. But he ditched his leg-powered mode of transport for what could be the fastest machine on the planet, when the £15million Bloodhound Supersonic Car pulled up outside Number 10. Measuring more than 13metres, it has been designed to reach 1,050mph in just 42 seconds, which would smash the current land speed record of 763mph. It means it can cover the length of four and a half football pitches in just a second. Leg powered: The Prime Minister was spotted riding a white scooter through Regent's Park in central London . Mr Cameron said the project was proof of what world class British engineers could achieve, and revealed his hope that it would inspire 100,000 extra 100,000 engineering technicians by 2018. The Prime Minister said: ‘British engineering and innovation are a part of our history that we are rightly very proud of and our engineering excellence continues to change the world that we live in for the better. ‘Bloodhound is a fantastic example of what our engineers can achieve. ‘Apprenticeships are at the heart of our mission to rebuild the economy, giving young people the chance to learn a trade and to build their careers, creating a truly world-class, high-skilled workforce that can compete and thrive in the global race.’ It is hoped the Bloodhound will beat the current land speed record next year and become the first land vehicle to smash 1,000mph by 2015. Design: Mr Cameron hopes the sight of the British-built car will inspire a new generation of engineers . The Bloodhound SSC project – sponsored by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers - was launched in 2008 to help inspire the next generation of British engineers and scientists. Mr Cameron today met Wing Commander Andy Green, the current world land speed and supersonic speed record holder who will drive the car during the record attempts. Stephen Tetlow, chief executive of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, said: ‘To help UK companies succeed in this ever-growing competitive global marketplace, we need people with the highest professional skills and abilities. ‘This initiative will ensure that the UK has a growing stream of Engineering Technicians being developed to a level that is recognised and respected around the world.’","£15million Bloodhound supersonic car aims to smash world record .

Police are to probe the alleged cover-up by health bosses over a hospital where up to 14 babies died. Officers will consider a report released last week which detailed how bosses at the Care Quality Commission deleted evidence that they failed to investigate an NHS trust properly. The Morecambe Bay trust runs Furness General Hospital where the deaths occurred. Storm: South Lakes MP Tim Farron (left) called for police to launch an investigation into allegations of a cover up. CQC's former deputy chief executive Jill Finney (right) insists she did not order the report to be deleted . Detectives in Cumbria will take three weeks to consider whether action will be taken against executives at the regulator. The move comes two weeks after it was announced that police would investigate hundreds of patient deaths due to appalling neglect in Mid Staffordshire. Barrow and Furness MP John Woodcock said: ‘I welcome this promise of swift action from Cumbria police which could bring home the appalling human cost of the cover-up at the CQC.’ But neighbouring South Lakes MP Tim Farron, who first called for a police inquiry, said the victims should wait ‘days and not weeks’. He said: ‘I understand complex issues take time to deal with, but for the police to read a report and to make a judgement if an investigation can be launched cannot take three weeks.’ The order to suppress an internal CQC review critical of maternity services at Furness General Hospital was issued last March, according to a report from consultants Grant Thornton. Up to 14 babies and two mothers may have died due to poor care since 2001, but the CQC gave the hospital a clean bill of health in 2010.

Correspondent Christin Cooper interviewed Miller just moments after he finished third in the Super G fnal, . The NBC reporter has faced a furious stream of abuse on social media for pushing Miller to answer questions about Chelone, 29, who died in April last year from a seizure. 'I appreciate everyone sticking up for me. Please be gentle w (sic) Christin Cooper, it was crazy emotional and not all her fault,' added Miller about Cooper's line of questioning in the immediate aftermath of his third place - which made him the most medaled skier in history and the oldest person to win an alpine medal at the Games. Miller was the first to bring up his brother, Chilly, a snowboarder who died in April from a seizure, but Cooper continued to push to the point that he had to walk away. However, this morning on the Today show, Miller told host Matt Lauer, that Cooper was not at fault. 'I have known Christin a long time, and she's a sweetheart of a person,' told Lauer. 'I know she didn't mean to push. I don't think she really anticipated what my reaction was going to be, and I think by the time she realized it, it was too late. I don't blame her at all.' Cooper pressed Miller on his brother well after Miller became visibly emotional. As Miller began to cry, Cooper asked if his performance was for Chilly. He struggled but managed to answer the question, saying that it wasn't for him but he wanted to make himself proud. But then she asked whether he had been talking to his brother when he looked up at the sky before the start of the race. This became too much for him causing him to fully break down, hunched over before walking away. Finally, his wife, professional volleyball player Morgan Miller, arrived to comfort him. 'I feel terrible that she's taking the heat for that because it really was just a heat-of-the-moment kind of circumstance,' Miller said. 'I don't think there was any harm intended. It was just a lot of emotion for me. 'It's been a lot over the past year. You sometimes don't realize how much you can contain that stuff until the dam breaks, and then it's just a real outpouring.'

But Miller chimed in on Twitter, somewhat defending the journalist, who was previously a skier before getting the TV gig. 'I appreciate everyone sticking up for me. Please be gentle w christin cooper, it was crazy emotional and not all her fault. #heatofthemoment' he wrote. He then added: 'My emotions were very raw, she asked the questions that every interviewer would have, pushing is part of it, she wasn't trying to cause pain.'

"By . Kevin Kilbane . PUBLISHED: . 17:30 EST, 24 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 17:35 EST, 24 January 2014 . I step away from my team-mates on the halfway line and head towards the goal. Making his way from the left is Iker Casillas, Spain‘s goalkeeper. I don’t see him. I don’t see anything. Not one of the best keepers in the world circa 2002. Not the goal. Not the 70,000 in the Suwon Stadium, although the scene behind the goal is a blur of green. I just want to know where the ball is. Pressure: Kevin Kilbane hangs his head after missing a decisive penalty against Spain at the 2002 World Cup . Step up: Kevin Kilbane celebrates after scoring his next penalty in Sunderland's 3-0 win over Blackburn . In my mind I go through the penalty kick to beat Casillas and get us to the quarter-finals. The quarter-finals. Beyond our wildest dreams. I try to get it all out of my head. From the day we joined up for the World Cup in Dublin, we practised penalties after every session. Mick McCarthy got some stick for saying, in his usual blunt and honest way, that he never saw the point. And he was right. You can never replicate the pressure of the real thing. The competition is always fierce in training. Believe me, I have seen penalty competitions nearly come to blows and some festering resentments. Goalkeepers don’t like conceding penalties. Ever. Especially Shay Given. And especially if the penalty taker tries to take the mickey, or tries something they would never try in a game, such as the Pirlo chip. At the end of those sessions in Ireland, England, Saipan, Japan and South Korea, I’d usually drill the ball with power to the keeper’s left. Yet when it came to hitting that ball in Suwon that night, for a place in the quarter-finals, I tried to place it and didn’t get the right connection. I don’ t know why. But I do know Casillas saved it. I don’t think there was a lower point in my career, certainly not an occasion I felt I had let so many people down. The words of consolation from Mick, my team-mates, friends and family took a while sink in. Brothers in arms: Manchester missed four of five penalties as they were beaten by Sunderland in the Capital One Cup . On the spot: Danny Welbeck and Adnan Januzaj (R) were guilty of not scoring their penalties . Six months later, an FA Cup tie with Sunderland against Blackburn Rovers and we went to a penalty shoot-out. I’d never shirked one before and I made sure I took one, going second after Kevin Phillips. And I made sure I scored, striking the ball cleanly, powerfully, to Brad Friedel’s left. We won 3-0. That helped bury the memory of South Korea for me. And the players who missed in the Capital One Cup semi-final at Old Trafford on Wednesday must step up again the next time they are in a penalty shoot-out. If ever an occasion proved that the pressure of penalties gets to players it was surely on Wednesday night. Ten penalties, only three scored, and players who you would expect to bury the ball in the back of the net, missed. When Craig Gardner stepped up as Sunderland’s first penalty taker it made complete sense. He can strike a ball, he has arguably the best technique in the Sunderland team, which is why he takes free-kicks and he is a confident player at set pieces. And he put his shot over the bar. Steven Fletcher, a striker who hits the ball sweetly normally, barely managed to hit the goal-line. Danny Welbeck and Phil Jones missed the target and Adnan Januzaj, arguably the one Manchester United player who has played with real confidence all season for one so young, hit a weak penalty that Vito Mannone saved easily. Howler: Jason Puncheon received plenty of stick for his badly missed penalty in Palace's game against Spurs . One other player who has had to come to terms with the pain of missing a vital penalty is Crystal Palace striker Jason Puncheon, who found his own way to get over the disappointment last week. His penalty against Spurs was one of the worst the Barclays Premier League has seen and understandably some people were quick to take the mickey out of him. And that’s inevitable when you hit one as wildly as he did a fortnight ago. Pundits, ex-players and even his former manager Neil Warnock had a go at him, and I can understand why he was upset at the attention he got for a few days. On reflection, he would be laughing himself if he had seen someone else take such a wild and poor a penalty. Although Palace manager Tony Pulis was upset immediately afterwards, he stood by Puncheon, who is a very talented player. There was never any doubt about him playing Pulis’ former team Stoke City last week. And Puncheon backed his faith by scoring the winner. The aftermath of that penalty miss was obviously not particularly nice for Jason. Many of us saw his reaction on Twitter, and he did bite to the criticism and the ‘jokes’. David Moyes always used to tell us that it takes courage to step over that white line because you are vulnerable, especially when things go wrong. But it is still the best way of answering the critics. Red tape: Accrington Stanley have been fined £20,000 because James Beattie doesn't carry a coaching license . James Beattie and Accrington Stanley should be receiving all the help they can get as they try to stay in the Football League. Instead they get a £20,000 fine from the very same organisation because my former Everton team-mate didn’t have the correct coaching qualifications. Rules are rules, and no manager in League One or League Two can work without their UEFA B licence, I understand that. But seriously, what purpose does it serve fining a cash-strapped club like Accrington? This is a club who James helped bail out in the summer by financing a club debt. Surely that loyalty should be recognised too. And he is not just a Sunday League manager who has been handed the reins by Accrington. James Beattie is a former England international and Premier League player who is now trying to make a living at a very difficult level and at a club who have to watch every penny. He also has Paul Stephenson alongside him, who is qualified, and vastly experienced and know what he’s doing. Sir Alex Ferguson managed to manage without the pro-licence, and it didn’t seem to do the new UEFA coaching ambassador any harm. Unqualified success: New UEFA coaching ambassador Alex Ferguson, pictured with Michel Platini (R), never held a pro license . I know the game has changed, and the FA and Football League want to ensure ex-players are properly qualified, but they don’t exactly make it easy for players to get their coaching qualifications. Although the FA are now running courses during the season, only a small percentage are enrolling. When I was a player – and I now have my A licence and will be completing the pro-licence this summer – courses were run over a four to six week period during the close season. But that’s a time when the last thing some players want to do is spend more time playing or learning about football. Sometimes they need a complete break from the game. And if they don’t their families do. Before I retired, I was asked to speak to a club about a vacancy but I couldn’t even go for the interview because I didn’t have my pro-licence. And yet I know having that qualification would have made absolutely no difference if I’d taken the job, and not having it would not have hindered me.

But far more important than that certificate is the experience he will gain in one of the most difficult jobs in the country, in one of the most precarious divisions in the world. Longevity is not exactly a word you hear often round the League Two clubs is it? It has not been an easy first season, in fact they looked doomed after a couple of months, but he has turned things round and got some good results and given himself and Accrington a chance of staying in the Football League. And I just think he deserved a bit more help and understanding from the authorities to do that. Sunderland supporters .

The remarkable discovery came when jubilant Egyptian archaeologists found the 12 sphinxes along a road linked to an already discovered ceremonial route known as the Sphinx Alley. It marked a route that ancient Egyptians promenaded along once a year carrying the statues of the deities Amun and Mut in a symbolic re-enactment of their marriage. Amun was ancient Egypt's supreme god king, while Mut was a goddess worshipped as a mother.","Khonso Em Heb was chief 'maker of beer for gods of the dead'

When three families moved to a remote yet picturesque village in the French countryside several years ago, they thought they had found the quiet, simple life they craved. The families, one of them British, had fallen in love with Bussière-Boffy, a tiny farming community, close to Limoges in central France, and decided to set up home in yurts - accommodation usually favoured by the nomadic people of the Asian steppes. But their peace has since been shattered after the families became embroiled in a bitter legal row with the mayor of the village who took exception to their unusual choice of home. Scroll down for video . Happy: Janie Corbett and her daughter Branwen, pose in front of the yurt where they have been living for several years . Bitter battle: The row has divided the small community of Bussiere-Boffy, near Limoges, with many siding with the mayor and others supporting the yurt families . The court battle has divided the village, with many siding with the mayor, Jean-Pierre Barrière, who claims he is simply applying planning laws, and others who support the British and French yurt families. Alex Bovet, a Frenchman who has a yurt on land he owns with his partner, has described the mayor's crusade as 'social cleansing and administrative harassment' according to The Telegraph. The British family at the centre of the row, antiques dealer and artist Peter Bateman, 44, his partner Janie Corbett and their children Branwen, 14, and Tarn, 10, moved to the area after they stumbled across it while heading home from a tour of the country eight years ago. They set up home in a field, with its owners consent and the two children attended the local school. The family were happy in their quaint surroundings until 2007 when the local council chose to map out plots of land where new buildings could be erected. Unusual choice of home: Three families who set up home in yurts in the small community of Bussiere-Boffy, France, have become embroiled in a legal battle with the local mayor who takes exception to their choice of accommodation . Comfortable: The yurt has a wooden floor and wooden doors and windows and is made of a wooden frame covered in material . The family could only stay on the land if the council decided that either the yurt constituted a tent - it is made of a wooden floor, wooden doors and windows and surrounded by a wooden lattice frame covered in material - or that the land was declared 'a new building zone'. But the mayor said that according to law the yurt constitutes a dwelling more akin to a bungalow than a tent. He claims it would have cost the town £34,000 to keep the yurts as the local authority would have been obliged to hook them up to the water and electricity supply. He refused to allow the families to be included on the electoral role the following year, and the inhabitants claim that he denied one of their children access to the local school. On a mission: Mayor Jean-Paul Barriere, pictured in front of the town hall, says that he is only adhering to planning regulations . Although the situation was temporarily calmed when the region's deputy government prefect promised that the yurtists would be accomadated, trouble flared again in 2010 when the mayor posted a decree banning 'wild camping'. A disgruntled Mr Barrière took legal action the following year when he was hit in the face with a pie during a television documentary on the row. The yurtists appeared to finally have won the long-running dispute late last year when a court ruled that their yurts are tents and they could stay on the land. But the prosecutor appealed the verdict and has now called for fines and orders for the families to leave the land within three months. According to The Telegraph, mayor Barrière said: 'They’re in a region where outsiders are already looked at askance, so you have to make a big effort to be accepted. 'But they think it’s up to us to adapt.'","Three families set up home in yurts in Bussière-Boffy,central France .

The UK is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to economic damage from flooding, a new survey has shown. The country ranked seventh on a league table behind the US, China, India, Bangladesh, Germany and Japan. Tightly packed buildings, crowded cities, and infrastructure built on flood planes all heightened the possible damage which could be caused by heavy rainfall. A new survey has shown that the UK economy is one of the most vulnerable in the world to flooding . We are also the most vulnerable country to extratropical cyclones, the type of storm that has been hitting the country over the last few months, and which features a very tight circle of low pressure at its centre. Maplecroft, the firm which produced the rankings, said that this type of storm was the most disruptive and costly kind  to affect northern Europe, and warned that they could become more common. The findings are part of the firm’s fourth annual Natural Hazards Risk Atlas, which assessed 197 countries on physical and economic exposure to 12 types of natural hazards, including flooding, storm surge, earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, wildfires and volcanoes. Dr Richard Hewston, Maplecroft’s Principal Environment Analyst, said: 'The future scale of the problem will depend heavily on the government continuing to build resilience and apply resources through flood mitigation and risk management schemes.' The news comes as homeowners have been warned that it may take until Christmas to repair their properties. Ministers have been under pressure to respond rapidly to the crisis which has seen about 5,500 homes flooded. But following a meeting in Downing Street yesterday, insurance firms claimed it could take up to a year for homes to be fully restored and that all household premiums could soon rise. A summit called by ministers in Whitehall saw insurers challenged over the time it takes to pay out claims and the process customers have to follow. Houses built close together and building on flood plains increased the UK's exposure to flooding . Cabinet ministers called for an end to costly premium rate telephone lines for customers calling insurers for help. Consumer watchdog champion Which? raised concerns that claimants were often forced dial 084 or 087 numbers, running up bills of up to 41p a minute. Floods minister Dan Rogerson insisted the industry had ‘got the message’ about the helplines - used by 79 per cent of home insurers including big names such as Ageas, Aviva, Axa, Churchill, Direct Line, Esure, Hiscox, Royal and Sun Alliance, and Virgin, according to Which? research - during talks in the Cabinet Office. ‘When it comes to telephone numbers, yes, we raised that and the industry are happy to say that they are taking that back to their members to deal with,’ he told BBC News. ‘We got the message across today that we would hope that they would address that and the Association of British Insurers and the members' companies that are represented there - of course, they can't speak directly for every single member company - but they took that away and they will be looking at that and we will keep that situation under review.’ The Chamber of Commerce has also revealed that flooding has cost businesses in Somerset alone more than £1.2million in just six weeks. Somerset Chamber of Commerce warned that the figures are 'only going to increase' as many businesses said it was too early to gauge the impact of the crisis. The chamber asked 170 businesses in the county to take part in their study, with 71 able to estimate damage caused so far.","Survey shows UK economy is one of the most vulnerable to funding .

A women is set to become the first in the world to give birth from a transplanted womb after doctors successfully implanted an embryo into her body. The unnamed woman, who was born without a womb, was one of nine to receive a womb transplant in Sweden between September 2012 and April last year. It is now hoped she will become the first in the world to successfully give birth following the procedure after doctors managed to transfer an embryo grown from the woman's own egg last week. This means any child she has through IVF would genetically be her own. New hope: An unnamed woman may now become the first in the world to give birth to a womb transplant baby after doctors successfully transferred an embryo into her body. Image shows Sweden's University of Gothenburg team practising how to carry out the womb transplant operation ahead of the procedure . And as her transplanted womb was transferred by her mother, her baby would also be the first in the world to be born from the same womb as their mother. Dr Mats Brannstrom, professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at the Sahlgrenska Academy, Gothenburg, who led the transplant team, told The Sunday Telegraph: 'The best scenario is a baby in nine months. The woman was one of nine to undergo womb transplants in Sweden between September 2012 and April last year. Picture shows the Swedish surgical team practising the transplant operation . 'A success would be an important proof of principle that a procedure is now available to cure uterine infertility.' The . woman suffers from MRKH syndrome, a congenital disorder which prevents . the womb from developing, but means she still has intact ovaries which . produce eggs. This meant her egg could be fertilised outside of her body and the embryo then placed in her womb. But the woman will have to wait and see if the embryo successfully embeds in her uterine wall before she will know if she is in fact pregnant. Dr Brannstrom admits it's impossible to estimate the chance of success. He told the newspaper: 'We know the pregnancy rate in the normal population − the chance for one embryo would be about 25 per cent − so it may take some trials until we get a pregnancy, or we may be lucky and get a pregnancy first time. We don’t know.' Seven of the other transplant patients also suffered from this condition while the ninth had her womb removed after suffering cervical cancer. The development will give hope to thousands of childless women across Europe and at least 15,000 in the UK. The method has been controversial though because it involves taking wombs from living donors. The Swedish team favours it because the organs are generally in better condition and a better immunological match. Other surgeons in the same field do not believe it is right to put a living donor through such a major operation when it is not life-saving. Procedure: Doctors grew an embryo from the woman's own egg before implanting it in her transplanted womb as it is not connected to her fallopian tubes . They say the best option is to use an . organ from a dead donor. This allows them to transplant extra tissue . and the major blood vessels needed to take the strain of pregnancy. Richard . Smith, head of Womb Transplant UK, said earlier this month that the . charity is ready to give five British women wombs from dead donors, . subject to receiving ethical clearance and raising the £500,000 required . to cover the cost of surgery. ‘We are good to go, save for the fact we . haven’t got any money,’ he said. Derya Sert, pictured, from Turkey, had a transplant in August 2011 and subsequently conceived but she miscarried after eight weeks of pregnancy . Mr Smith, a consultant gynaecological . surgeon, described the Swedish breakthrough as ‘amazing’ and said a . successful birth would bolster similar projects around the world. Any . babies the Swedish women bear are likely to be delivered by caesarean . section and the new wombs will be removed after only one or two . pregnancies. The women are on powerful immunosuppressant drugs but the biggest worry is how well a transplanted womb will cope with the strains of pregnancy, during which the womb swells from the size of a pear to that of a melon. Critics question the process, with fertility expert Lord Winston saying the risks are too great and some women should accept that they will never bear children. Those in favour say it is the only way for some women to fulfil their deep-seated yearning to have a baby. Experts say the operations will only be considered a success on the birth of a healthy baby. Dr Yacoub Khalaf, medical director of the Assisted Conception unit at Guy’s and St Thomas’ hospital in London, said: ‘What remains to be seen is whether this is a viable option or if this is going to be confined to research and limited experimentation.’ The world’s first womb transplant took place in Saudi Arabia in 2000. However, the woman’s body rejected the donated organ after four months. Turkish doctors performed a successful transplant in 2011, but patient Derya Sert lost her baby during pregnancy last year.","Woman suffers from MRKH syndrome - a congenital disorder which prevents the womb from developing, but doesn't impact the ovaries .

Breaking the rules: Ghazala Javed performed songs in her native Pashto language despite the ban on singing and dancing . A beautiful pop singer who defied the Taliban's decree against music and dancing was shot dead after she left a beauty salon last night. Pakistani star Ghazala Javed, 24, was shot after a motorcyclist opened fire on a car she was in with her father, who was also killed. Police said that one of the suspects is her ex-husband, who she reportedly asked for a divorce after finding out he had at least one other wife. Her demand was a highly unusual one for a deeply conservative and male-dominated society where many consider a woman asking for divorce a dishonour to the husband. Ms Javed, who was popular with young, progressive ethnic Pashtuns in northwest Pakistan, was reportedly driving home with her father when a motorcycle raced towards their car and opened fire. She was hit with six bullets and and pronounced dead along with her father at a hospital in Peshawar, according to CNN. In recent years the rise of the Pakistani Taliban, who disagree with singing and dancing, made it difficult for Ms Javed and other artists to perform and record songs in the country. Ms Javed had started recording many of her songs and music videos, which she sang in her native Pashto language, in nearby Dubai. But early indications were that the Taliban were not involved in her shocking death, according to police official Imtiaz Altaf. Last year Ms Javed made headlines when . she left her husband to live at her father's home after just six months of marriage. Scroll down for video .

'Two men on a motorbike sprayed bullets and fled leaving them in a pool of blood,' said senior police officer Dilawar Bangash. 'We have registered a case and launched an investigation.

Fraudster: Mohammed Khatana has been ordered to pay back £1.3million he made through scams . A fraudster who posed as a lawyer and offered 'expert' legal advice to criminals has been told to pay back £1.3million he stole from the taxpayer. Despite having no legal qualifications or accreditation, Mohammed Khatana set up a cowboy consultancy firm offering guidance to crooks that faced having cash and assets seized by police under proceeds of crime laws. The 51-year-old father-of-three - who used his own daughter to act as a front for his scam - then charged vastly inflated fees for his 'services' which he claimed from the taxpayer-funded legal aid scheme. Last September Khatana, of Brierfield, . near Burnley was jailed for eight and a half years after he admitted 15 . charges of fraud. He has now been given six months to pay the money back or face another six years in prison. In a written judgement Judge Graham . Knowles QC said of Khatana: 'He is a professional career criminal who is . resilient and flexible. 'He does not regard imprisonment so . much as an occupational hazard as a necessary part of the work to be . done to obtain money from his crimes, albeit paid in arrears. 'I have regard to his history of . criminality, his use of his mother’s accounts to conceal the financial . realities, to sham property transactions, to the known existence of the . Pakistani bank account and to his failure to provide any information . about it. 'I find it inherently improbable this . man would not commit offences without making very large profits. The . likelihood is that he took large fees for concealing the assets of other . criminals and that he has hidden them or their proceeds.' Preston Crown Court was told how the former property dealer - who drove a Mercedes and lived in a five bedroom house on a private estate in rural Lancashire - advertised his services via a website and in prison newspapers. He would visit clients in jail, discuss their needs, then go away and procure the necessary services for the criminals from solicitors' firms. Khatana would then double the genuine firm's quoted price, submit a legal aid claim to the Legal Services Commission, and pocket the difference himself. Guilty: The website Khatana used to advertise his services before he was jailed for eight and a half years after admitting 15 counts of fraud . The court was also told how the British Muslim used 'cultural pressure' to make his daughter Mahria Khatana participate in his scheming, having her join a lawyers' association and network with defence solicitors and barristers at trade functions. When one of her father's sizeable legal aid claims was queried by a judge, the 25-year-old verified it in court. Khatana was arrested as he left a hotel near Bury after an undercover  operation led by detectives from the North West Regional Organised Crime Unit, following a three year investigation into his shady firm POCA Consulting Ltd. The sting saw an undercover policewoman pose as the girlfriend of a client to meet with Khatana, who offered her advice on how to keep her partner's money out of the reach of authorities at a cost of £20,000. The court heard how Khatana billed one 74-year-old client facing confiscation proceedings for money laundering £43,000. He should have been charged just £10,000. The money was recouped by the Khatanas through legal aid at the expense of the taxpayer. Mohammed Khatana was sentenced to eight and a half years in prison after pleading guilty to 15 counts of fraud. Mahria Khatana, who admitted four counts of fraud, was given a 12-month prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, and ordered to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work. Passing sentence, Judge Graham Knowles QC told Khatana senior: 'Your plan from the beginning was that this business would be a vehicle for fraud. 'You are a determined and persistent and versatile professional criminal. What you did was intended to undermine the whole legal process.' Detective Superintendent Jason Hudson from the North West Regional Organised Crime Unit said: 'Khatana was a ruthless serial fraudster who was prepared to use his own daughter to steal from a wide range of individuals for his own gain. Luxury: Khatana lived in a five-bedroomed home on a rural private estate in Lancashire and drove a Mercedes coupe . 'Cheating the taxpayer is not a victimless crime especially in these difficult times - yet this man has shown little remorse.' Matthew Coats, chief executive of the Legal Services Commission, said: 'Legal aid funding is public money and we will not tolerate people trying to defraud the taxpayer.' Mohammed Khatana has previously served time in jail for his part in smuggling amphetamine 'pill-making' machines into Britain from China during the 1990s. In a later scam he sent letters to companies up and down the country offering to register them under the then new Data Protection Act, and warning them that they could be prosecuted if they did not pay up. The firms were charged a fee of £135 for Khatana's 'service', when the true cost of registering was £35. He was jailed for four years in December 2004 and ordered to pay back almost £500,000. It was upon his release from prison that Khatana set up his shady legal advice firm POCA Consulting Ltd. Detective Chief Inspector Paula Parker, head of the North West Regional Asset Recovery Team said: 'Khatana was a ruthless and serial fraudster who was prepared to use his daughter to steal from a wide range of people for his own gain. It was clear he was making a large profit by abusing the legal aid system.' 'We will do everything we can to investigate the finances of people who we believe have obtained their money illegally, and then work with the courts to remove negative role models from society and take their wealth off them.'","Mohammed Khatana, 51, jailed for eight and a half years for fraud last year .

The campaign to tear Scotland out of the United Kingdom has failed to gain any ground despite the launch of the Scottish National Party’s long-awaited prospectus for independence. An exclusive poll of more than 1100 Scots for The Mail on Sunday has revealed that only 27 per cent of voters plan to vote yes in next year’s referendum, while 56 per cent intend to vote no and 17 per cent still don’t know how they will vote. It means that support for Scottish independence is still trailing far behind the pro-Union campaign – and remains at the same level as an identical Mail on Sunday poll carried out in September. The poll was the first carried out since the SNP launched its ‘white paper’ on independence, which was supposed to provide details of every aspect of what an independent Scotland would look like. Setback: Alex Salmond's launch of the white paper on Scottish independence does not seem to have boosted support for his cause . As well as asking the main question that will appear on the referendum ballot paper – 'Should Scotland be an independent country?' -  the poll also found that only 23 per cent of Scots think they would be better off if Scotland went it alone. Experts say that the findings reveal that the series of pledges unveiled by Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond last Tuesday have failed to have any impact on voters. It leaves the yes camp staring at defeat with less than one year to go until the vote. SNP leaders had described the launch of the White Paper as a ‘key moment’ in the referendum campaign and were desperate to get a pick-up in the polls from the media blitz which followed the launch of the White Paper. Opposition: The news will be welcome for Alistair Darling, leader of the pro-Union 'Better Together' campaign . Polling expert John Curtice, a research consultant at ScotCen Social Research, said: ‘There can be little doubt that the yes side will be disappointed with this result because it does not show any evidence of any measurable swing of opinion. ‘Opinion on this has proved to be so stable in the last 12 months.  All the criticism of the no side has not gone anywhere so why should we be surprised a paper by the yes side makes no difference either? ‘The yes side may say the white paper will be a slow burner but, given the intensity of the media splash following the launch, they may have hoped it would make some difference. ‘One of the reasons there has been no immediate impact is it has not immediately persuaded people that people will be better off and this is crucial.’ The Mail on Sunday’s survey, carried out by respected pollsters Progressive Scottish Opinion – the first firm to correctly predict the SNP majority victory in the 2011 Holyrood elections – is the first test of public opinion since the launch of the ‘Scotland’s Future’ document, with 1134 Scots surveyed over the course of last Wednesday and Thursday. In an identical poll carried out by the same firm in September, 27 per cent of Scots intended to vote yes while 59 per cent intended to vote no and 14 per cent did not know how they would vote. Despite an unprecedented push to attract female voters, who have traditionally been less supportive of independence than men, the poll shows that just 23 per cent of women intend to vote yes, while 56 per cent will vote no. The SNP had been hoping to secure an upturn in support from women after pledging to increase the amount of free childcare in an independent Scotland. There was also a huge difference in voting intentions depending on whether people work.  Incredibly, two –thirds of unemployed people intend to vote yes, compared to just one in four of full-time workers – a clear sign that lose who have most to lose are most fearful of separation. Much of the SNP’s campaign has focused on the Westminster coalition’s welfare shake-up. The poll also asked voters how independence would affect their own household financially – a crucial aspect of the referendum campaign since the SNP claim they will secure a yes vote if people think they will be £500 better off. It found that just 23 per cent of people think that their household would be better off if Scotland became independent, while 49 per cent think they would be worse off and 13 per cent thought their finances would be the same – with the remainder not knowing how they would be affected. Debate: Scotland will go to the polls to decide its future on September 18 next year . Since last Tuesday’s launch, the SNP have come under fire for failing to provide a ‘plan B’ on currency if they fail to secure a pound-sharing currency union with the rest of the UK following a yes vote, and for failing to accept the demands that other EU countries may place on them in order to grant a separate Scotland EU membership. Alistair Darling, chairman of the pro-Union Better Together campaign, said: ‘The SNP’s manifesto for breaking up the UK completely failed to pass even the basic tests. ‘They failed to offer a plan for what currency we would use if, as seems increasingly certain, the rest of the UK say no to Scotland keeping the pound, they failed to tell us anything about how much independence would cost us and their wish list of false promises lacked any sort of price list. ‘And their claims that we could leave the UK without losing anything fell apart when the Spanish Prime Minister said that leaving the UK meant leaving the EU. ‘What was extraordinary was that the only new policy they announced was something that they could deliver now because childcare is already the responsibility of the Scottish Parliament and the SNP Government. ‘This poll confirms that Scots are choosing devolution in the UK over separation from the UK. But we cannot be complacent for one moment.’ Mid Scotland and Fife is the part of Scotland with most support for the Union, with 67 per cent of voters intending to vote no. Surprisingly, another stronghold for the Better Together campaign is North East Scotland, where the SNP has been most successful in recent years, where 64 per cent intend to vote no and only 26 per cent intend to vote yes. Support for the Union increases with age, with 63 per cent of the over-55s intending to vote no, compared to 42 per cent of 18-24-year-olds. On the question of household finances, top earners were more likely to think they would be worse off in an independent Scotland – which is a clear sign that voters fear savage tax rises – with 54 per cent of those in the ABC1 social grade thinking their household would be worse off in an independent Scotland, compared to 45 per cent of people in the C2DE social grades. Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said: ‘We take nothing for granted and continue the fight to keep our United Kingdom together. ‘The majority of the Scottish people have seen through the empty prospectus of the white paper and have recognised it is little more than an uncosted wishlist. ‘Scotland is better off as part of one of the largest and fastest growing economies in the developed world, with a stable currency and a fully funded pensions system. ‘In stark contrast, the SNP’s White Paper featured just a single page on how a separate Scotland would be paid for, which beggars belief.’ Drew Smith, Scottish Labour's constitutional spokesman, said: ‘The SNP promised the White Paper would be a game changer but it would appear it has had no impact on the people of Scotland who just don't share the SNP's obsession with the constitution.’","Only 27% said they would vote for independence in Mail on Sunday poll .

After first one, and then both, of her older sisters were diagnosed with breast cancer, Marianne Corr refused to take any chances. Identical twins Louise Hughes and Amanda Ford elected to have double mastectomies to prevent the disease returning, and Miss Corr bravely resolved to do the same – despite being perfectly healthy. But while tests confirmed that her 43-year-old siblings were carriers of the faulty BRCA2 gene which causes breast cancer, it turned out Miss Corr was not. Louise Hughes (left), Amanda Ford (centre) and Marianne Corr (right) have all had double mastectomies. Twins Ms Hughes and Ms Ford, 43, both carry the BRCA gene and both developed breast cancer . Despite that, she says she has no . regrets about her surgery. In fact, the three sisters believe their . ordeals have brought them closer together. The 40-year-old telesales worker . said: ‘I decided I didn’t want my breasts. I was offered counselling, . but no counselling in the world would have made me change my mind. ‘It was the best decision I ever made. Now I don’t have to worry. I don’t have to wait for it to happen to me.’ There had been no history of breast . cancer in the family before Mrs Hughes, a mother of three who runs her . own company preparing venues for events, was diagnosed with the disease . in 2005. After seeing what her sisters had been through, Ms Corr decided that she should also undergo a double mastectomy. She later discovered that she does not carry the faulty gene . Louise Hughes (left) had a mastectomy and immediate reconstructive surgery when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005. Amanda Ford (right) decided to stagger the operations when she was also diagnosed . Mrs Hughes, then 35, decided to have a . double mastectomy at Queen’s Hospital in the sisters’ home town of . Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, followed by immediate reconstructive . surgery in Birmingham. Five years later, Mrs Ford, who runs a gardening business with husband Hadyn, was also diagnosed with the disease. She was told she would have to have . one breast removed because of the size of her tumour, leaving her . ‘devastated’. But after doctors told her she carried the faulty gene, . which meant there was an 80 per cent chance of the disease returning, . the mother of two asked them to remove the other breast as well. She said: ‘I had helped Louise . through the tough times and knew that she would do the same for me, and . that I would beat the cancer just as she had. We were close before and . this has just strengthened our sisterhood.’ Ms Hughes and Ms Ford are both now free from the disease and Ms Corr says she does not regret having the surgery as even without the faulty genes women have a one in eight chance of developing breast cancer . A cell needs to have a number of mistakes in its genetic code before it becomes cancerous. Doctors call these mistakes faults or mutations. They can occur due to substances people come into contact with. Or, they can happen because of mistakes that cells make when copying their genetic code before dividing into two new cells. Most of these abnormal cells die or are killed off by the immune system. It usually takes many years to gather enough genetic mistakes to cause cancer. But it is possible to be born with a gene fault that increases the risk of cancer. Scientists have identified a number of these so-called 'cancer genes'. The first genes to be found were BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 - women with these genes have a 50 to 80 per cent chance of getting breast cancer in their lifetime. Women who tests positive can either have regular breast screenings or have surgery to remove their breasts (and possibly ovaries). In between the twins’ diagnoses, . their mother, Pilar Corr, had a pre-cancerous lump removed, and was . found to carry the faulty gene. A cousin was also diagnosed with breast . cancer. By the time Mrs Ford was diagnosed, . Miss Corr had made up her mind to follow the twins down the surgery . route. She had the operation in June 2011. Weeks afterwards she decided . to take the blood test too, which established she was not a carrier of . the faulty gene. Miss Corr, who is separated from the father of her three children, said: ‘Genetic or not genetic, I didn’t want my breasts. ‘The test was irrelevant. I had the op before I had the test and it wouldn’t have made any difference, whatever it had said. ‘It was just the fear of it happening . to me. It was something  I always thought about and I’d been paranoid . about it since I was about 25.’ The faulty gene can be passed down family lines, increasing the risk of cancer. But the absence of it did not mean . Miss Corr would never develop the disease, as it accounts for only a . small proportion of cases. She said the sisters were speaking . out now to publicise a ball they have organised to raise money for . Queen’s Hospital, where each of them had their operations. Their younger brother, Andrew, 32, who is in the Royal Navy, has not been tested for the gene. Last month, Hollywood actress . Angelina Jolie, 38, revealed she had undergone a pre-emptive double . mastectomy after tests confirmed she carried the faulty BRCA1 gene. It meant she had a 87 per cent chance of contracting breast cancer and a 50 per cent chance of contracting ovarian cancer.","Twins Amanda Ford and Louise Hughes, 43, both carry the faulty gene .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 08:49 EST, 6 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 19:32 EST, 6 January 2014 . Green protesters have been accused of firing a flare at a police helicopter. The aircrew said the flare appeared to come from the Barton Moss site, in Salford, police have claimed, but protesters at the camp have denied the claim. Police claimed the incident, which happened around 12.15pm on Saturday as the helicopter came in to lane at Barton airfield, could have had 'catastrophic' consequences. Police officers carry out a search warrant on the anti-fracking protest site at Barton Moss, in Salford . Police have said a flare was fired at a police helicopter as it came in to land at a nearby airfield on Saturday . Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said it had executed a search of the site under a warrant issued by a local court. Chief Superintendent Mark Roberts, of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'This is was an unbelievably stupid act of criminality which was extremely dangerous, not only for the police helicopter, but all other aircraft that use the nearby Barton airfields and the wider public. 'Had this flare caused an emergency situation it would not only have been catastrophic for the aircraft and its crew but potentially for numerous homes near the airfield, the M62 motorway and a childrenâ€™s residential facility. 'The protest camp appears to be a tight knit group who seem to be continually filming anything occurring on Barton Moss Road. 'If one of the protesters is responsible, I suspect their identity will be known to others and I would expect those reasonable members of the anti-fracking campaign to provide any information they have to the police.' The camp was set up last month after gas company iGas received permission to start exploratory drilling for the controversial extraction process. Protesters have denied the flare was fired from the camp and said anyone seen firing a flare would have been asked to leave and report themselves to the authorities . Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said it had executed a search of the site under a warrant issued by a local court . Other incidents have seen protesters gluing themselves to gates and chaining themselves to vehicles. A huge wind turbine blade was also used to block an access road. Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, involves pumping water, chemicals and sand into shale rock at high pressure to blast it open and release gas which is trapped inside. Campaigners warn it is catastrophic for the environment, including causing earth tremors and contaminating the water supply. One site in Lancashire was suspended briefly last year after the test drilling caused small earthquakes. But the government supports exploring the divisive technique, saying it will boost the country's energy supplies at a time of uncertainty. A statement in August said 'government policy seeks to increase security of supply', adding there was a 'continuing role for gas in the energy mix and support for shale gas exploration'. The process is only at a test phase in Britain, but has already come under intense scrutiny. Chief Supt Roberts added: 'An attack on the police of this nature has nothing whatsoever to do with whether or not exploratory drilling is right or wrong. 'Whilst I recognise the genuine concerns of many of the protesters in relation to exploratory drilling, it is obvious that there is also an element of regular protesters from outside the Greater Manchester area who seem more interested in seeking confrontation with the police. 'GMP continue to balance facilitating peaceful protest with the rights of others to go about their lawful business, whilst minimising disruption to the local community and businesses. 'Because of the way the camp is set up we have to systematically search the site under a warrant issued by a local court.' Protesters have denied the flare came from the camp. Sophie Baxter, spokesman for Frack . Free Greater Manchester, one of the groups protesting at the camp, . dismissed the police's claims. She said: 'The allegations are untrue. The camp has a safe space policy that includes no violence and no aggression. 'Anyone seen firing a flare would have been asked to leave the camp and report themselves to the authorities.' Fracking has already proved to be hugely controversial, sparking protests in Balcombe in West Sussex when exploratory drilling began last summer . More than 1,000 activists set up camp in Balcombe in a bid to stop the firm Cuadrilla from drilling a test well last summer . She said it was the second time the police had wrongly accused protesters of firing a flare at a helicopter, the previous occasion being New Year's Eve. She added: 'It's just an excuse to go into the camp. 'All along the behaviour of Greater Manchester Police has been outrageous. 'They have been really aggressive and removed people's right to protest from them.' More than 40 per cent of Britain could be opened up for fracking as the hunt for shale gas gathers pace . Sacha Conway, who is currently living at the site, said: 'No flare was fired from this camp on Saturday or any other day. 'We would condem any such action as aggressive, violent and in breach of our very strict safe spaces policy. 'We are peaceful people who wish to stop the destruction of this land by IGas and all of the other fracking companies.' Rachel . Thompson, from Frack Free Greater Manchester, said: 'We refute this . claim. Greater Manchester Police have refused to show any evidence of . this alleged incident. 'The allegations are untrue. The camp has a safe space policy that includes no violence and no aggression. Anyone seen firing a flare would have been asked to leave the camp and report themselves to the authorities' - Sophie Baxter, spokesman for Frack Free Greater Manchester . 'The behaviour of Greater Manchester Police has been outrageous throughout this whole campaign. 'In our eyes this is just another aggressive tactic aimed at isolating the camp from the community and to put them in a bad light. 'We have asked for a meeting with the Police Commissioner, Tony Lloyd to discuss the disgusting behaviour of his officers and have been refused.  This matter is now with our lawyers but we wish to make it clear that we stand by Barton Moss Community Protection Camp and we call for an inquiry into this alleged incident.'

"By . Christopher Stevens . PUBLISHED: . 17:45 EST, 28 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:46 EST, 29 November 2013 . Anarchy, acts of terror, crimes against the public. To combat it, I’ve got special men: experts from the Army, the police,  from every service — these are The Professionals!’ That rousing mission statement, overlaid with the throb of wah-wah guitars and screaming engines, heralded the controversial British action series that was a grittier, tougher answer to U.S. cop duo shows like Starsky And Hutch. Will Bodie and Ray Doyle were The Professionals — anti-terrorist agents licensed to use ‘any means necessary’. Scroll down for video . All-action: Lewis Collins playing anti-terrorist agent Will Bodie in the Professionals . That included beating suspects to jelly, shooting to kill and driving Ford Capris through plate-glass windows . . . they did their own stunts, too. Doyle (Martin Shaw) was the sensitive one with a bubble-perm and a conscience. The real hardman of the show was saturnine Bodie, the ex-mercenary played by Lewis Collins, who died in Los Angeles on Wednesday after a five-year battle with cancer. Bodie and Doyle were the paramilitary wing of MI5, a maverick unit called CI5 run by George Cowley, played by war movie veteran Gordon Jackson. It was his Glaswegian growl that warned of ‘anarchy’ and ‘acts of terror’, and set the uncompromising tone for the show. For all their outrageous machismo, the friendship between Bodie and Doyle sometimes verged on camp — and if Collins had been more of a suave Roger Moore figure, The Professionals could have looked as fake as Charlie’s Angels or other U.S. ‘action’ imports. But his tough-guy persona was no act. Collins was super-fit, a part-time paratrooper from the docks of Birkenhead. After the show ended, he applied to join the Special Air Service, and passed the initial selection stages for the territorial unit 23 SAS, before senior officers ruled that his celebrity status made him a security risk. Family: The British actor with his wife Michelle Larrett and their 19-month old son Oliver at their wedding . ‘I was just playing myself in The Professionals,’ he admitted. ‘I was a sensitive, shy boy, but I went to a very hard school and you had to learn the ground rules.’ After he was clubbed to the ground in a street fight by a boy wielding a brick, Collins took up martial arts and became a judo brown belt. His father Bill was a shipwright and amateur musician, who played the piano in local clubs with a band called the Savoy Swingers. Born in 1946, Lewis showed an early love for performing — at two, he won a contest as the Most Beautiful Baby in Liverpool. Bill bought him a drumkit for £25 and young Lewis was soon playing with the Swingers. But this was the era of Elvis and Buddy Holly, and at 13 he joined a group of older lads to form The Renegades. The ‘beat’ music scene in Liverpool was just beginning. ‘We were all in the same Coke can being shook up, and we knew this thing was going to explode!’ he said. The Renegades didn’t make the grade, though, and in the early Sixties Lewis decided to be a hairdresser instead. He started training at the Andre Bernard salon, and soon tasted success: teenage singing sensation Helen Shapiro insisted that only he could do her beehive when she was in the city. His fellow apprentice, Mike McCartney, had an older brother called Paul who was in a local band. The two hairdressers used to try to write songs on piano and guitar at the McCartney house, and one day in 1962 Mike urged his mate to audition as drummer for his brother and The Beatles, to replace Pete Best. ‘Are you mad?’ Collins retorted. ‘Don’t you realise, in two years I could be earning £42 a week?’ Instead, he drifted from hairdressing into playing bass guitar for one-hit wonders The Mojos, before taking a job as a lorry driver, delivering crisps and lemonade. One afternoon, sitting in a lorry cab with no heater and listening to a play on the radio, he decided to become an actor. Deadly force: Mr Collins (right) with his Professionals co-star Martin Shaw . ‘When I told my mates back at the depot they all laughed,’ he admitted, ‘it was like saying I wanted to be an astronaut.’ Within a year he was at Lamda, a drama school in Hammersmith, London, where fellow student Patricia Hodge remembers his sheer physical presence. Playing Romeo in a fight scene one day, Collins bolted from the building, apparently stricken with stage fright — and then came racing back, panting and sweating as though he really had just fought off a gang of thugs. That energy and urgency would leave him frustrated for much of his acting life. He complained bitterly about the endless sitting-around, the inactivity and small-talk that made up much of an actor’s life, especially on film sets. Stars of the Professionals: Shaw (left to right), Gordon Jackson and Collins on the set of the series which first aired in 1977 . Instead of traipsing round auditions, his first job after Lamda was at Glasgow Citizen’s Theatre where he taught drama to deaf-and-dumb children, learning sign language so he could communicate with them. His first TV part came in the police drama Z Cars in 1974, but his breakthrough was with the three-in-a-bedsit Granada sex comedy, The Cuckoo Waltz, with Diane Keen and David Roper. They were hard-up newlyweds, he was the lodger who constantly tried to seduce his landlady. Meanwhile, Brian Clemens, principal screenwriter of the quirkily English spy series The Avengers, was trying to cast a more brutal, less eccentric follow-up, something with a sour punch to match the Seventies mood. He hired Martin Shaw and tried him out alongside the golden-haired Anthony Andrews, later famous as Lord Sebastian Flyte in Brideshead Revisited — but the chemistry was missing. Then Clemens remembered a 1976 episode of The New Avengers, where Shaw played opposite a brooding actor who seemed to rub him up the wrong way. Deadly: During the hit TV show his character was licensed to use 'any means necessary', including beating his suspects to jelly and shooting to kill . On-screen and off, they circled round each other, one snarl away from a punch-up. This was the tension the new show needed. The actor was Collins. He was called to audition for a bit-part, without realising the producers were sizing him up for a lead role, and was disconcerted by the way they stared at him. Bristling and defensive, he looked ideal, and five days later he was filming the first episode. Budgets were tight and the actors sometimes had to rest in their cars on location. As their fame grew, they learned to dread being woken by the shout of, ‘Hey, look who it is’, and a crowd of young fans hammering on the car windows. The Professionals ran for five series and made Collins a star and a national sex symbol. As one wag said: ‘Men want to be him, women want to be patted down by him.’ His character was foul-mouthed and sexist, with an explosive temper. Though only 5ft 11in, he could lift bigger men by the lapels and throw them across the room. When one girlfriend tried to slap him, he dumped her in a horse trough. The hard punches and dockside language sparked controversy and calls for London Weekend Television to cancel the show. Career: The British actor also starred in a drama about serial killer Jack the Ripper . One episode was shelved: The Klansman, where Bodie and Doyle fought white supremacists, revealed Bodie apparently had racist sympathies. After he was stabbed by a black gang member, Bodie was tended in hospital by a voluptuous Caribbean nurse, whose tender ministrations overcame his prejudices. By the end of the episode he was dating her. In 1982, as The Professionals was ending, Collins auditioned to become the new James Bond. The right man at the wrong time, he would have been perfect for the modern Bond movies, as a tough but damaged 007. Producer Cubby Broccoli took five seconds to consider Collins, all short fuse and suppressed violence, and decide that he didn’t want him. Instead, Collins played an SAS captain in a film based on the Iranian embassy siege, Who Dares Wins, and went on to be typecast in shoddy war movies such as Code Name: Wild Geese and Kommando Leopard. Father: Collins had three sons, Oliver, Elliot and Cameron and was . photographed picking one of his children up from a sports event in Los . Angeles in 2011 . He burned off energy with marathon walks for charity, flying and sky-diving: when he and his teacher wife Michelle had the first of their three children, they named him Oliver Sky, because to Collins the sky was the best place in the world. In despair at doing TV work such as a gameshow version of Cluedo, in which he played Colonel Mustard, Collins moved his family to Los Angeles. He studied film directing at the University of California, and tried to make his fortune with a computer company surfing the tech explosion. But though his last TV appearance was in 2002 in The Bill, he never abandoned his acting ambitions. Last summer, ill health forced him to withdraw from 1066, a film based on the Battle of Hastings, in which he was to play the English King Harold’s father, the warlord Godwin, Earl of Wessex. He might have thought that fans had forgotten him. But the extraordinary outpouring of affection as news of his death spread on social media yesterday proves how fondly he was remembered. Lewis Collins yearned for action, but he was at his most charismatic when he was motionless — sullen, smouldering, like a blow waiting to fall. As countless women, and a fair few men, recalled on Twitter yesterday, he was their first crush . . . and you never forget that.","The British actor played agent Will Bodie in the series which began in 1977 .

"By . Jack Doyle . UPDATED: . 04:18 EST, 30 January 2012 . Violent criminals, including murderers, have been using Facebook to taunt victims and their families from behind bars. Other prisoners have been maintaining their criminal empires via the social networking site. Inmates are banned from accessing the internet but manage to get online by using mobile phones  smuggled into jails. Convicted killer: Liam Ryan, 19, is pictured in an image posted on Facebook making an obscene gesture in his cell at Brinsford young offender's institute. Figures show 350 prisoners have been caught accessing the social network from their cells despite a strict ban on internet access . Violent: Ryan, who stabbed a shopkeeper to death, makes a gun shape with his fingers and points the 'weapon' down the lens of the secret camera . In the last two years, nearly 350 have been discovered posting on Facebook. It is likely there are dozens of others using the site without the authorities being aware. The official figures have raised major concerns about security failures in prisons. Last night victims’ groups said criminals using Facebook were adding ‘insult to injury’. Attackers who taunted their victims were getting away with torture, they said, and called for tougher measures to control the problem. Javed Khan, chief executive of Victim Support, said: ‘Offenders using Facebook from prison makes  a mockery of the idea that they are being punished. It adds insult to injury when they use it to intimidate victims and witnesses. Victim Support would like to see this more tightly controlled and monitored.’ Jean Taylor from Families Fighting for Justice said: ‘These perpetrators should not be able to have access to mobile phones in prison. ‘They are getting away with torturing their victims. The social networking sites should police this much more closely.’ The problem emerged two years ago when the Justice Secretary at the time, Jack Straw, revealed that 30 Facebook sites had been taken down after prisoners were found to be abusing their victims from behind bars. At the time Mr Straw said the situation was ‘horrible, profoundly disturbing, and deeply offensive to public morality’. But today’s details suggest the problem is getting much worse. Ministry of Justice figures released after a Freedom of Information request show that 143 Facebook profiles were removed between July 2009 and June 2010. Another 199 were removed between July 2010 and June last year. All were closed by Facebook following investigations by prison officials. There is no indication how long the pages were on the internet before they were closed. A source close to Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke said: ‘The internet is banned for prisoners. Anyone caught using Facebook in prison will be severely disciplined. 'Ken is absolutely determined to stamp out the use of mobile phones in prisons and other illicit items such as drugs.’ Facebook posts: Colin Gunn, who is serving 35 years for conspiracy to murder, used his Facebook page to threaten people from behind bars. Convicted killer Ryan Herbert sent flirtatious messages to female friends from his Facebook account, and posted pictures of himself and other inmates in the prison gym . Two years ago it emerged that one of Britain’s most dangerous gangsters, Colin Gunn, was using Facebook to threaten his enemies from his high security prison cell. The gang boss, who was locked up for 35 years for conspiracy to murder, was able to correspond with up to 565 ‘friends’ for more than two months until the page was shut down. There were also fears he was able to carry on running his crime empire from behind bars. In one posting, Gunn wrote: ‘I will be home one day and I can’t wait to look into certain people’s eyes and see the fear of me being there. ‘It’s good to have an outlet to let you know how I am, some of you will be in for a good slagging, some have let me down badly, and will be named and shamed, ****ing rats.’ The 44-year-old was jailed in 2006 over the revenge killings of John and Joan Stirland, who had fled threats in Nottingham to hide on the Lincolnshire coast. Last year Ryan Herbert, who murdered 20-year-old Sophie Lancaster in 2007, was found to have sent more than 100 messages using the site. He sent flirtatious posts to female friends and uploaded pictures of himself with other inmates in the prison gym. Recently a teenager who killed a shopkeeper posted a series of pictures on Facebook showing him making ‘gangster salutes’. Easy to conceal: Prisoners use mobile phones equipped with internet access smuggled into jails to access Facebook and other web services . Liam Ryan, 19, was jailed for life for the murder of Suppiah Tharmaseelan in Birmingham. The pictures, apparently taken in his cell, show Ryan making an obscene gesture. They also show piles of junk food in his cell, and his personal television set and games console. Prison chiefs have attempted to use technology to jam mobile phones within the walls. But they have struggled to make it work, especially in urban prisons where blocking a signal may affect nearby residents. Prisons also use body scanners on visitors to try to prevent mobile phones getting into jails. A Prison Service spokesman said: ‘Prisoners have no access to the internet and are barred from updating their Facebook accounts, or asking others to do so from outside prison. If they do, their accounts will be terminated. ‘If a prisoner is found in illicit  possession of a mobile phone or other contraband they will be  dealt with appropriately by the prison.’ A Facebook spokesman said: ‘If something is happening which violates our use policy we will be very active and robust in removing it.’ 'Insult': Brooke Kinsella, sister of murdered teenager Ben Kinsella, was appalled to learn one of his killers was able to operate a Facebook page from prison . One of the killers of 16-year-old Ben Kinsella used his Facebook page to taunt his victim’s family from behind bars. Jade Braithwaite, 22, boasted that he was ‘down but not out’. For his profile picture, he mocked up a T-shirt emblazoned with his face and the slogan ‘Free Jade Braithwaite’. From his cell at a Buckinghamshire youth prison, he wrote of how he wanted a remote control so that he could ‘mute or delete people when I need to’. The mocking posts were revealed six months after Braithwaite, Juress Kika and Michael Alleyne were convicted at the Old Bailey in June 2009 of murder. Ben’s sister, Brooke, 28, a former EastEnders actress, said at the time: ‘My family and I are appalled that Jade Braithwaite is able to operate a Facebook page from inside prison – and to use the site to protest his innocence is really upsetting. 'We are disgusted by the comments on the site and feel it is a real insult to Ben’s memory.’ Ben was out in Holloway, north London, celebrating the end of his GCSEs in June 2008, when he was stabbed 11 times. In February 2010, the then Justice Secretary Jack Straw intervened after a meeting with Margaret and Barry Mizen, whose son Jimmy was murdered in a bakery in Lee, south-east London. Mr Mizen believed that his son’s killer Jake Fahri, 21, had been using Facebook and Twitter to post bullying and offensive comments about his son, accusing him of being a ‘pathetic loser’. Aaron Aymer, 22, who stabbed his girlfriend’s brother to death in 2007, used a page to protest his innocence. He posted a photograph of himself in a body-building pose.

"By . Jaymi Mccann . PUBLISHED: . 11:21 EST, 11 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:32 EST, 11 March 2013 . An end-of-terrace former squat has sold for £80million in one of Britain’s biggest ever property deals. The house, opposite Regent’s Park in London, is spread over a vast 21,500sqft and was once the home of the New Zealand High Commissioner. Experts expected it to be purchased by a businessman from Russia or the Middle East, but British property mogul Marcus Cooper has snapped up the property. The end of terrace mansion is regarded as one of the country's most important private properties and sold for £80million . One Cornwall Terrace, London, was designed and built in the 1820s by architect Decimus Burton . Mr Cooper, 47, who runs the Marcus Cooper Group, has set up a separate company, 1 Cornwall Terrace Limited, to buy the property. And at £80 million, Mr Cooper's company will have to pay a further £12 million in stamp duty alone. But they would also pay just £1,369-a-year in council tax - the same as a £320,000 property with Westminster Council - the second cheapest borough in London. The garden of 1 Cornwall Terrace features beautiful marble staircases and terrace . Hippies turned the beautiful house into a squat when it was empty in the 1970s . Described as 'one of the most important private residences in London', the four-storey home has had a no expense spared makeover to be transformed into one of the capital's premier 'trophy homes'. It boasts a mixture of classic and contemporary features from marble and limestone-lined halls to iPad-controlled lighting. There is also a sports complex which includes a gym and swimming pool and the high-tech gates have an automatic number plate recognition system. Outside, the mansion has a beautiful 40-metre long landscaped garden and a grand double staircase which connects the terrace and landscaped areas. And if that isn't enough, the home is located on the Outer Circle Road around Regent's Park - which has 410 acres of gardens and leisure facilities. Despite Cornwall Terrace Mews being one of the most exclusive addresses in the country the property failed to meet its £100million price tag . Mr. Cooper is a private businessman who has spent the past 20 years buying some of the capital's finest homes including the 25-bedroom Witanhurst in Highgate. Cornwall Terrace was originally designed and built in the 1820s by architect Decimus Burton with the project overseen by famed John Nash. Decimus Burton also built Buckingham Palace. The front of 'number one' has a neo-classical Stucco elevation with Corinthian pilasters and a grand two-storey bay embellished with sculpted female columns of the Greek goddess Artemis. In addition to seven bedrooms it also boasts 11 bathrooms, nine reception rooms and a catering kitchen. The property was bought by property trader Marcus Cooper who runs Marcus Cooper Group . The building has a facade featuring stucco statuettes and mouldings of Greek goddesses . It was the official London residence of the New Zealand High Commissioner from 1955 until the 1970s, playing home to lavish parties attended by royalty and other VIPs. In 1975, hippies broke into the home and turned it into a temporary squat. According to figures from the Land Registry, the average price of a house sold in the UK in January was £162,411. This makes One Cornwall Terrace, at £80 million, 492 times more expensive than the average property. Gary Hersham, managing director of Mayfair-based Beauchamp Estates, said: 'There have been six or seven sales north of £50 million in the past six months and this is at the top end. 'It is excellent news for the strength of the top-end of the London housing market. 'It also goes to show the soon-to-be-paid mansion tax and potential of capital gains had no significant bearing on the sale of the house.' Property expert Henry Pryor added: 'It's a trophy home and I'm not surprised by the value, it is probably in the top eight per cent of homes in London. 'It is a cracking address and the purchaser would have had to compete with people from all over the world. 'There are three or four deals like this a year and the sale underlines the confidence in the market."" Mr. Cooper is understood to have bought One Cornwall Terrace after seeking advice from estate agency Knight Frank, which today declined to comment on the sale. The property was being marketed through Savills estate agents who confirmed the deal but would not give any further details about the transaction.","One Cornwall Terrace is a Grade 1 listed mansion overlooking Regent's Park .
