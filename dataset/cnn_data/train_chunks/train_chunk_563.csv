Abuse of trust: Geoffrey Oldham stole more than £44,000 from members of a Cheshire credit union to fund holidays in Spain and Wales . A trusted director of a credit union has been jailed after admitting stealing more than £44,000 of savings from the elderly and poor to fund holidays in Spain. Geoffrey Oldham, 62, set up false accounts to siphon off money from members of the Warrington North East Credit Union in Cheshire. But he was caught out after member Alice Regan died and her son discovered more than half of her her £8,000 savings was missing. An investigation then uncovered a fraud that had been running for more than five years. Many of the credit union's 2,000 members considered Oldham a friend. The organisation allows people to pay in savings and take out small loans at low risk. They are often the only safe way for poorer people to borrow money and many pensioners prefer them to banks. Warrington Crown Court heard how Oldham, a father-of-four, . abused his senior position at the branch on Cinnamon Lane in Padgate to . rip off members and used the money to fund holidays in Spain and Wales. Recorder . David Williams said he had 'tarnished' the Credit Union's reputation . and sentenced him to 12 months in prison after he pleaded guilty to . fraud. He said: 'For a short time, the name of the company will be tarnished when it becomes known someone of your position did this. 'You used customer accounts to get money for yourself. The court finds it unfortunate to send a man of your age to prison. Your job will go. Your name will go.' The WNECU is an organisation with 2,000 members. Oldham, of Bentfield Court, Padgate, Warrington, had been director and vice chairman of the union since 2002 and was responsible for writing cheques, arranging loans and collecting money. Shock: Members of the Warrington North East Credit Union said they had trusted Oldham and many considered him a friend . He 'professionally planned' the fraud between January 2007 and January 2012, stealing £44,491 from customers. Rob Jones, prosecuting, said he set up 30 false accounts using their names, and then wrote cheques to himself and pocketed the cash. Hannah Brookfield, defending, said the grandfather was saddled with debts for credit cards and clothes magazines following a divorce. 'There is no suggestion this is a gentleman who lives a luxurious lifestyle,' she said. 'He had a moral obligation to pay off those debts and now accepts he went about it in a wholly wrong way.' The court heard that all of the money stolen was covered by a Credit Union insurance policy and returned to members. Following the hearing, Sandra Bradshaw, chairman of Warrington North East Credit Union, said colleagues were left in 'shock' by Oldham's scam. She said: 'It was a real shock. 'We truly trust all of our directors and he was well-liked by members. It is a betrayal of trust. 'There was no way we would've found out because of the way he did it. 'We have now made sure that nobody is in the position to be able to do anything like that again. 'I'd like to reassure all members that the fraud was covered by our insurance. We have reviewed all of our policies to ensure that it cannot happen again.'","Geoffrey Oldham, 62, stole from the organisation for more than five years .

Successor: Tony Blair has revealed he is still giving advice to David Cameron on his 'damned difficult job' in Number 10 . Tony Blair is still giving advice to David Cameron on his ‘damned difficult job’ in Number 10. The former Prime Minister said yesterday he had given counsel to his successor-but-one ‘from time to time’. In remarks that will irritate his Labour colleagues and many Tories, Mr Blair said he was equally available to help Mr Cameron and Labour leader Ed Miliband. ‘When you’ve gone through all this and sat in the seat both as leader of opposition and prime minister, you know how damned difficult both jobs are,’ he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. He said he approached discussions with both men with a sense of ‘humility’ because he wanted to avoid being ‘one of those pains in the neck that’s in the back seat saying I would have done this or I would have done that.’ Mr Blair also took a swipe at Mr Miliband, warning he had to transform his One Nation rhetoric into ‘practical policy’. He said: ‘I don’t think there’s a problem with the vision. I think there’s a big challenge with how you translate that vision into practical policy.’ A source close to Mr Cameron said the last time the pair met in person was September, although they did speak ‘from time to time’ on the phone. He added: ‘The idea that he is in and out [of Number 10] is complete nonsense.’ Mr Cameron once described himself as the ‘heir to Blair’ - a remark that alarmed Tory traditionalists. His foreign policy has also taken a more interventionist tone - with British support for rebels in Libya leading to the despotic Colonel Gaddafi’s demise. Britain was also quick to support French military intervention in Mali, offering troops for ‘training’. During a visit to North Africa last week, Mr Cameron used language that was reminiscent of Mr Blair, calling the region a ‘magnet for jihadists’ and warning of a ‘generational struggle’ against them.

David Cameron yesterday warned Nick Clegg not to split the Coalition by siding with Labour in the Commons over calls for a new Mansion Tax. The Prime Minister told reporters he would be ‘disappointed’ if his deputy opted to vote for the controversial policy which would impose a swingeing tax on homes worth more than £2 million. But Mr Clegg refused to rule out siding with Labour to back a policy that has long been a cherished Liberal Democrat goal. Clash: The Prime Minister David Cameron, left, has said he will be 'rather disappointed' if his deputy Nick Clegg, right, supports Labour's mansion tax policy . Labour is planning to drive a wedge between the Coalition partners by forcing a Commons vote on the principle of a Mansion Tax in the coming weeks. A Labour source taunted Mr Clegg yesterday, saying: 'Here is a chance for Nick Clegg to prove he can keep at least one of his promises.' Labour leader Ed Miliband his hoping to drive a wedge between the Coalition partners with his mansion tax policy . Downing Street has said all ministers will be expected to back Government policy, which is against a Mansion Tax, in any vote. But . Business Secretary Vince Cable has indicated he may side with Labour . and Mr Clegg also suggested yesterday that he might vote against the . Prime Minister on the issue. He told ITV News: ‘Neither Vince nor I know what will be put before us so we can’t of course determine in advance how we would vote. ‘But of course the Liberal Democrats for a long time have been the leading advocate of greater fairness in tax. ‘The Conservatives don’t want to do that. They don’t want, perhaps, to offend people in very large mansions. ‘They need to answer for themselves. I’m absolutely sure that what we stand for is the right thing.’ During a round of interviews in India yesterday Mr Cameron suggested that for Lib Dem ministers to vote with Labour on the motion could break the terms of the Coalition deal. Asked about whether Mr Clegg would vote with Labour, he said: ‘I haven’t asked him the question, but as it’s not in the Coalition Agreement to have a Mansion Tax, I would be rather disappointed if he did.’ Mr Cameron made light of suggestions that the Labour leader’s initiative might tempt Mr Clegg into a future coalition with Labour. Row: David Cameron told a press conference during his trip to India the mansion tax was not part of the Coalition Agreement . ‘That’s a matter for him to answer,’ he said. ‘It’s enough running one coalition, without trying to work out what another one would be.’ Meanwhile, George Osborne moved to rule out any Mansion Tax, describing it as a ‘tax con’ which would quickly be applied to much more modest homes. The Chancellor said: ‘It’s very costly to implement. It means you have to send inspectors round the country valuing all the homes - not just the homes worth over two million but those worth less... It’s actually a tax con that you know there aren’t that many mansions in the country that can be taxed to pay for some tax cut for millions of people. 'So either it’s a tax con and the money comes from somewhere else or it’s soon a homes tax and they say it’s a mansion tax before the election and then very quickly becomes a homes tax on many people who are not living in mansions at all.’ Meanwhile, Mr Clegg will risk charges of complacency over the Eastleigh by-election by jetting off to Spain on holiday. His party are facing their biggest by-election test in years as they seek to defend the Hampshire seat vacated by disgraced former Cabinet minister Chris Huhne. They insist they are taking nothing for granted, especially as their Conservative coalition partners are the main challengers. But the Liberal Democrat leader is pressing ahead with a ‘long weekend’ in Spain. A party source said: ‘Miriam has taken the children for half-term and he wants to be there for their youngest son’s birthday.’","Prime Minister says mansion tax was not part of Coalition agreement .

A building with an invisible 'wall of death' has been blamed for the deaths of dozens of migrating geese who flew straight into it after mistaking it for the sky. The pale grey-coloured wall on the end of The Sands apartment development in the seaside town of Scarborough, North Yorkshire, stands directly in the birds' flight path to the North Sea. The colour of the paint means many Canadian geese have flown into the wall, breaking their necks and falling to the ground. The wall is now peppered with indentations made by the birds' beaks. Blending in: The side wall of a seaside block of flats in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, has been painted to blend in with its surroundings but is causing the deaths of numerous geese which are mistaking it for the sky . Birds have apparently struggled with the . building since it was built in 2008 and developers have put up LED lighting to . act as a deterrent. But residents have claimed the building's lighting is ineffective and birds are still being killed by flying into the wall.

Their brother Otto remembers the girls heading for the door, with one shouting: 'Hurry up. They're waiting for us down the street' - and it was the last words he ever heard them speak. There have been no leads into their . disappearances but the family has not given up; they have now turned to . social media and have ploaded artists' renditions of what the girls would look like today. No trace: Fifteen-year-old Fawn Abell, left, and her 18-year-old sister Rozlin, right, have been missing since July 25, 1985, when they went to look for jobs, and investigators have no leads in the case .

'To this day we still don't know what happened to them,' their brother, Otto Abell, told News 9. 'It keeps you up at night and you just go on and on about different things. It's been this long, I'm pretty sure something bad happened to them.' No trace of the girls has been found since they disappeared in the middle of the day that July. A missing persons report was only . placed for Fawn as she was a juvenile at the time, and Lt. Austin . Warfield, who is investigating the case, told NewsOK she was listed as a runaway for some time.

'We don't know if the girls are still . alive,' Warfield said. 'We don't know if any human remains of the girls . have been found and not identified yet, and we don't know if the . remains are somewhere in a field.'

Catch Chris Robshaw off the pitch, however, and you’re more likely to find him tackling the vacuuming and wearing a ‘onesie’ – according to his girlfriend. The England captain received praise from both sides for a man-of-the-match display which helped his side win 12-6 in Dublin yesterday – the first time they have beaten the Irish on their home turf in the Six Nations for a decade. But he might now attract a few changing room jibes after Camilla Kerslake’s insights into their cosy domestic life. The 24-year-old singer said: ‘When Chris does come home, I give him a  massage to help his aching muscles and cook him a healthy meal. ‘I cook and he does the hoovering around the house – it’s a modern relationship. 'When we pop out for a coffee or meal, I usually pay for it as he insists on paying most of the household bills. 'He’s a complete gentleman and you have to be creative to keep things financially equal. ‘At the end of the day we just prefer to stay in, put on our onesies and watch television. 'We have no desire to be seen coming out of nightclubs bleary eyed and stumbling over the pavement.’ However, she admitted the couple’s evenings together are few and far between due to work commitments. Rather than cheering from the stands during yesterday’s Six Nations match, the soprano was at home preparing for a concert, and confessed that she often has to miss games because of her heavy work schedule. She also revealed that the pair, who bought a two-bedroom Victorian end-of-terrace house in Kingston, Surrey, last year, have never been able to spend 26-year-old Robshaw’s birthday or Valentine’s Day together. She said: ‘We probably go out three nights a year. We both can’t drink most of the year because Chris is an athlete and it affects my voice. 'It’s so rare that we’re at home together for a long period, so when we are we make the most of it. ‘It’s tough that I can’t go to all of Chris’s games and support him because I would really like to, but he understands that I have to work as well.’ Work mode: Chris Robshaw received praise from both sides for a man-of-the-match display which helped his side win 12-6 in Dublin yesterday .

She was wrapped up against the cold in a faux fur coat…but it’s a blue Chelsea shirt that most of Britain will forever associate with Antonia de Sancha. Her revelations that Tory government minister David Mellor made love to her in his club strip kept the nation amused for months. Never mind that her infamous claim, along with the toe-sucking and spanking, were made up. The damage was done and Mr Mellor eventually quit the Cabinet. Two decades later: Antonia De Sancha, 51, famed . former mistress of ex-Tory minister David Mellor, pictured outside a restaurant in west London recently (left) and at the time of the affair (right) Two decades on, the 51-year-old former soft porn actress whose affair with the married ‘minister for fun’ rocked John Major’s scandal-prone government, steadfastly avoids the limelight. Her hair unkempt sitting outside a tapas restaurant in London’s Notting Hill, cigarette in one hand and a bottle of beer on the table in front of her, Ms de Sancha happily chatted with friends. But approached outside her shabby, one-bedroom flat in nearby Willesden Green, North West London yesterday the woman who was seldom far from the headlines in 1992 was not keen to talk. She gruffly barked: ‘I don’t want to speak to any journalists,’ before slamming her front door. The minister and his mistress conducted their affair in a London flat lent to the actress by one of her friends, who bugged his own phone and sold the tapes to a newspaper. Contrast: Although she was wrapped up in a coat, the item of clothing most associate with Miss de Sancha is still a certain Chelsea shirt . The lover: David Mellor, pictured on the night he quit as Heritage Secretary in 1992, following a number of scandals, including his affair with Miss de Sancha . In the ensuing blaze of embarrassing publicity, then Secretary of State for National Heritage Mr Mellor tried to convince the world that his marriage to ever-loyal wife Judith was fine, despite Ms de Sancha’s sordid sex revelations, lining up his entire family behind the garden gate at his in-laws’ cottage in Sussex for press photographers. The minister remained in the Cabinet for several months until he quit after it was revealed that he had accepted a free holiday from femme fatale Mona Bauwens, the daughter of a Palestinian Liberation Organisation official. Two years later Mr Mellor admitted another affair, with the married Lady Penelope Cobham, and he was divorced by his wife in 1995. Ms de Sancha, the daughter of a Spanish father and Swedish mother, says she made around £30,000 for her kiss ‘n tell story - arranged by PR guru Max Clifford - and cites the affair and attendant publicity as the cause of her failed marriage to dental surgeon Clive Hager. They married in 1994 but divorced a couple of years later. Following the affair she took part in a . TV documentary The Mistress, became agony aunt of Erotic Review . magazine and imported textiles, rugs and jewellery from India and . Thailand. In a newspaper . interview in 2002 to mark the 10th anniversary of her revelations, Ms de . Sancha confessed that certain sordid details of her affair with Mr . Mellor were untrue. Rough patch: Miss de Sancha, wrapped up in a fur coat against the January London weather in notting Hill, still blames the 1992 affair for the collapse of her marriage two years later . Retraction: A decade after her saucy affair with David Mellor was splashed across Britain's newspapers, Miss de Sancha admitted she made up the Chelsea club strip, the spanking and the infamous 'toe sucking' Back to her roots: Half-Spanish de Sancha visited a tapas restaurant where she enjoyed a Spanish beer and a cigarette with a friend . ‘The Chelsea strip was made up,‘ she admitted. ‘I went along with everything at the time. It was almost like I was having an out-of-body experience.’ Asked about the spanking and toesucking, she added: ’It didn’t happen.’ She also addressed the question everyone asks her about the affair. ‘What the hell attracted me to him? That’s a question I sometime ask myself on very rare moments at awkward times in my life. ‘Oh God, absolutely nothing attracted me to him physically. But sometimes you meet somebody who is not an oil painting but you can forget about that and it’s no longer important, it’s who they are and what they’re like inside,’ she explained. ‘The excitement was, to be perfectly frank, from being with somebody who was in a peak position of power.’ Former minister turned opera critic Mr Mellor, who lives with his partner Viscountess Cobham at their Thames-side home in Wapping, remains irked by the false football strip claims. Giving evidence to the Leveson Inquiry into media standards last June he said he was ‘sick’ of hearing about them. ‘ It was a total invention. ‘All you will remember about me when I go to my grave is some bloody Chelsea shirt.’ When Antonia de Sancha's affair with David Mellor was revealed in 1992, it kicked off a course of events which contributed to the downfall of John Major's government. Mr Mellor was backed by the Prime Minister, and repeatedly professed his commitment to his wife in an effort to keep his job as Secretary for National Heritage. But after it emerged that he had accepted a free holiday from a glamorous socialite whose father was a Palestinian Liberation Official he was finally forced to resign. The string of scandals eventually led to the break-up of Mr Mellor's marriage to his wife Judith - and had wider repercussions within the Conservative Party. Other ministers such as Tim Yeo and Steven Norris were also revealed to have had affairs, while rising star Stephen Milligan was found dead in what was believed to be a case of auto-erotic asphyxiation. The succession of embarrassing incidents was widely held to have undermined Mr Major's 'Back to Basics' campaign which emphasised the importance of family values and other traditional Tory issues. Couple with a wave of sleaze scandals such as Neil Hamilton allegedly agreeing to ask questions in Parliament in return for a bribe, the affairs played into the hands of Tony Blair's New Labour, which swept to power in 1997 with a landslide election victory. One of the reasons Mr Mellor's indiscretions became so memorable was the addition of vivid details such as his wearing a Chelsea football shirt during sex, which was splashed over the front page of the Sun, above right. However, Ms de Sancha later admitted she had made up that particular anecdote.","Antonia de Sancha spotted at west London restaurant in faux fur .

Lord Forsyth, an adviser on tax to Mr Osborne before the election, said it was ‘very disappointing’ that by freezing the threshold at £325,000, the Chancellor broke a promise made while in opposition to raise it to £1million. At the time Mr Osborne pledged that ‘in a Conservative Britain, only millionaires will pay death duties’. As criticism grew over the freeze –intended to help fund reforms of the social care system – former Tory leadership contender David Davis said it would impact ordinary people, especially in the South East of England, where house prices were high. ‘Conservatives should favour ordinary people – and this will impact ordinary people,’ he said. ‘Millionaires won’t be affected, since they will have expensive accountants to look after them.’ In 2007, Mr Osborne’s pledge to lift the threshold to £1million boosted Tory ratings by up to five points and David Cameron’s net rating by 24 points – enough to frighten Gordon Brown out of holding a snap election. But after Lib Dem opposition the pre-election promise was abandoned in 2010, and the threshold has been frozen since – pulling more people into the tax net. Mr Osborne had been expected to make modest increases in the threshold before the next election, but it will now remain frozen for at least another six years. Lord Forsyth, a former Scottish Secretary, said: ‘The thing about inheritance tax is very rich people don’t pay it. They set up trust funds for their children or they buy shares of agricultural land and shelter their assets. ‘The only people who pay are the middle classes whose main asset is the roof over their heads. ‘Inheritance tax is unfair. It hits the middle classes and it taxes people twice, because they have already paid tax on the money they used to buy a house. ‘George said he wanted a fairer, lower and flatter tax system – and inheritance tax doesn’t tick the box on fairness. If you are wanting growth, actually you want people to save and invest – and this penalises people for doing that. Former Tory leadership contender David Davis, left, said Mr Osborne's threshold freeze would affect 'ordinary families' and not millionaires, who 'have expensive accountants to look after them' 'Those who spend their money on Ferraris and fripperies won’t have to pay inheritance tax, but if you invest and set aside for your children you will. ‘George made a promise to increase the inheritance tax threshold to £1million. So it’s to say the least very disappointing that we should have broken that promise, and it’s hard to see how this squares with the Prime Minister’s declared intention to support the striving classes.’ Mr Davis added: ‘Those who will be affected are ordinary families, particularly in the South East of England, where house prices are expensive. 'People understood and accepted that dropping the pledge to increase the threshold was part of the coalition deal, even if they didn’t like it. 'But to see a freeze effectively extended right through the next Parliament is something that will be simply dismaying to a lot of people.’ Mr Davis added that there was a ‘certain irony’ that Mr Osborne was adopting Labour’s approach to funding social care reforms. Before the election, Labour said it would cap the costs of residential care so people’s homes and savings were protected from care charges after two years by freezing inheritance tax thresholds until 2014-15. Treasury figures suggest the number of families paying inheritance tax will increase by more than a quarter to help pay for the new care cap. In 2011/12 about 19,000 estates paid inheritance tax. Treasury sources said the decision to freeze the rate would drag in a further 5,000 families each year – an increase of 26 per cent. Middle class families who find the estates of their late parents have broken through the £325,000 limit will be the main group affected. Many wealthy families who employ accountants to avoid the tax will continue to pay nothing. In a critical review of inheritance tax this month, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said: ‘It tends to fall on the moderately wealthy, often with their wealth tied up in a house and no idea how to circumvent the tax, as often as the very richest.’ Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Inheritance tax is a double tax that unfairly targets families just for having the misfortune of losing a loved one. ‘It’s disgraceful that the Chancellor has gone back on his word.’ Tory MP Mark Pritchard said: ‘Inheritance tax is a regressive tax and in an ideal world we would be increasing the threshold to £1million as we promised. ‘But we don’t live in an ideal, Conservative world. Colleagues are disappointed but also realistic about what we can do given the state of the public finances.’ A Treasury source said: 'For the first time – after Labour ducked this issue for years – people’s inheritance will now actually be protected in the first place. '20 per cent of the cost will come from continuing to freeze inheritance tax but for couples this threshold stands at an effective £650,000. 'An increased allowance is of little use if your assets have already been used to pay for care.' ● Labour has forged a 12-point lead over the Conservatives for the first time in almost a decade, according to a Guardian/ICM poll. Ed Miliband’s party now has 41 per cent of the vote, three points higher than in January. The Tories are on just 29 per cent, having slipped back four points. The Liberal Democrats have fallen two points, to 13 per cent, while Ukip have gone up three to 9 per cent.","Lord Forsyth says inheritance tax threshold freeze penalised middle classes .

Boost: Prime Minister has taken to drinking a fruit smoothie called a Brain Boost when he is relaxing at the weekend . For David Cameron, the strain of leadership can take its toll at times. And so the Prime Minister has taken to drinking a fruit smoothie called a Brain Boost when he is relaxing at the weekend. The drink contains beetroot juice, which is said to help improve circulation to the brain and memory. Mr Cameron has the drink when he visits the Portobello Fresh Juice Bar near his family home in Notting Hill, West London, with his wife Samantha and their children. Cafe staff say he believes the pint of smoothie helps him keep concentration and focus after a busy week of meetings. One worker said: ‘The Prime Minister and his family have been visiting for years and they were all in here again just recently. Sometimes they come here on foot but usually it’s by a chauffeured car.‘Mr Cameron is obviously a creature of habit and always orders  the same thing – a massive fruit smoothie called Brain Boost. ‘The Brain Boost doesn’t come cheap at £5.50 but it does contain plenty of freshly squeezed apples, beetroot, carrots and ginger. ‘It is packed full with vitamins and ironand is said to boost circulation to the brain, and the PM swears by it. He has told me that it actually helps his concentration and keeps him focused, especially after a hard day’s graft at Number 10 or in Parliament. ‘Mr Cameron says he loves coming in here because he can just chill out and spend quality time with his family and be just like any other bloke. Getting the PM's vote: Mr Cameron has the drink when he visits the Portobello Fresh Juice Bar near his family home in Notting Hill, West London, with his wife Samantha and their children . ‘Well, almost every other bloke – except that he always comes in with a small team of bodyguards who sit at the other tables in order to keep a close eye on him while he is chilling out.’ Mrs Cameron, meanwhile, is said to prefer a detox drink called  the Body Clean, which contains apples, carrots, cucumbers and oranges. But their visits are not always entirely healthy, with Mr Cameron partial to a slice of the cafe’s carrot cake. A waitress said: ‘Mr Cameron adores the carrot cake and has joked with the staff that he feels guilty eating it as he wants to keep in trim. The staff always have to reassure him that it’s made with low-fat Philadelphia cheese and so it isn’t that high in calories.’ When it comes to settling up, the staff said either Mr Cameron or his police protection officers pay the bill. They added: ‘Does the PM tip big? You’ve got to be joking, let’s just say that the staff couldn’t retire any time soon on what the PM and Samantha leave behind!’ A Downing Street spokesman declined to comment.

Ed Balls has warned Ed Miliband not to be ‘stupid’ and allow Labour to be cast as the ‘anti-referendum’ party on Europe. The Shadow Chancellor, who was last night forced to welcome David Cameron’s success in negotiating a lower EU budget in Brussels, said his party needed to be careful not to become ‘caricatured’ as the ‘pro-status quo’ party on the issue. Labour leader Mr Miliband shocked colleagues by appearing to rule out an in/out referendum after the Prime Minister promised one last month, though aides attempted to undo the damage by saying he had not meant to do so forever. Don't be 'stupid': Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls (right) warned Ed Miliband (left) not to allow Labour to be cast as the 'anti-referendum' party on Europe . Mr Balls, who is said to have been pressing for a more robust line on Europe for months, told the Yorkshire Post that he was happy with Labour’s position ‘for now’. ‘As long as we don’t allow ourselves to be caricatured as an anti-referendum party, which we’re not - we’ve absolutely not ruled out a referendum - I personally think that for now this is quite a comfortable position for us,’ the shadow Chancellor said. ‘If we allow ourselves either to be the “status quo party” on Europe, or the “anti-referendum party” on Europe, then we’ve got a problem. ‘But I think we would be pretty stupid to allow ourselves to get into either of those positions.’ In the Commons, Mr Cameron ridiculed Labour’s position - pointing out the party gave up a large chunk of the EU budget rebate won by Margaret Thatcher in 1984, and urging it to persuade socialist allies in the European Parliament to back the new deal. The Prime Minister said he had fended off repeated attacks on what remains of the UK’s rebate, which he declared ‘safe’. Mr . Cameron told MPs the UK had successfully rejected proposals by Europe’s . ‘big spenders’ for an increase in the budget, as he won the backing of . Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden for a reduction in the EU’s credit . card limit. Back the new deal: David Cameron ridiculed Labour's position - pointing out the party gave up a large chunk of the EU budget rebate won by Margaret Thatcher in 1984 . He told MPs it was ‘disappointing’ that administrative costs were still six per cent of the total budget, but he was pleased spending on the Common Agricultural Policy would fall by 13 per cent on the last seven-year budget. Mr Cameron launched a strong attract on EU officials who resisted budget cuts, claiming they see themselves as ‘higher beings who even refer to civil servants elsewhere as burger flippers compared to their lofty role’. He also said the European Council should start its meetings in the morning rather than over dinner and into the early hours of the morning. Last week’s talks ran through the night and into the next day, taking 26 hours in all. Sir Malcolm Rifkind: Mr Cameron had been 'successful at winning the most important reform in the EU budget since Margaret Thatcher' A series of Conservative backbenchers, . including some of his harshest critics, spoke to praise Mr Cameron’s . budget deal. Former defence and foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind . said Mr Cameron had been as ‘successful at winning the most important . reform in the EU budget since Margaret Thatcher at Fontainebleau’. Eurosceptic MP Mark Reckless, one of the leaders of a Parliamentary revolt against the Government over the EU budget last year, hailed the deal and said it would save every household £150. However, the budget still needs to be approved by the European Parliament, where MEPs have caused outrage by suggesting that they might use a secret ballot to maximise the chances of it being rejected. Mr Cameron said it would be a ‘very serious situation’ if the Parliament blocked the deal and condemned the idea of a secret vote. He said: ‘I would encourage every MEP from right across the United Kingdom, whatever their party, to support this budget because it is better to have a deal than have no deal and this deal is right for Europe’s taxpayers.’ A Labour source said: ‘It is ridiculous to suggest there is a difference between Ed Miliband and Ed Balls on Europe. As Ed Miliband set out in his speech at the CBI in November, Labour believes our priorities should be to promote growth at home and secure influence abroad. ‘Both Ed Miliband and Ed Balls believe committing to an in/out referendum at the moment will not help either of these priorities.’ A Labour spokesman added: ‘The Labour Group of MEPs will be voting for the European budget deal agreed at the European Council summit last Friday.’","Ed Miliband shocked colleagues by appearing to rule out an in/out referendum after the Prime Minister promised one last month .

Burly: Enforcers Tony Lawrence and David Riddick, pictured looking back, went to Jeffrey Ashfield's home armed with a High Court writ taken out against the millionaire . A wealthy businessman threatened two bailiffs with a shotgun after they tricked their way into his country home to seize over £1.2 million worth of property, a court heard. The burly enforcers went armed with a High Court writ taken out against millionaire Jeffrey Ashfield, director of a company that sells aircraft and parts. Tony Lawrence and David Riddick were refused entry when they arrived at the gates of 62-year-old Ashfield's home Hayselden Manor in Cranbrook, Kent, on July 31 last year. But they found a gap in bushes surrounding the property, knocked down a fence and managed to reach the front door. When Ashfield, whose business interests include Aircraft Avionics Parts Support Ltd, Aviation Capital Solutions Ltd and Chobham Engineering Ltd, answered the door he was served with the writ. He still refused entry but allowed them into the house to photocopy the writ. Once inside, Mr Lawrence and Mr Riddick saw their chance to start seizing property, Maidstone Crown Court heard. Mr Lawrence told a judge: 'I said: ""As I am in the house, we are going to have to levy on all the goods in the house.' 'Mr Ashfield was not very happy about this and said no, we couldn't. He tried to forcibly eject me. Mrs Ashfield appeared and asked us to leave. 'Mr Ashfield said if we didn't leave the premises he was going to get a gun. My colleague advised him it would not be a very good idea and if he did he would get himself in a lot of trouble. 'Mr Ashfield disappeared. Mrs Ashfield insisted we left and said we were trespassing and she would call the police. We told her we were not going to leave and if she wanted to call the police that was fine by us. 'Mr Ashfield appeared in the hallway with a double barrel shotgun. It was on his shoulder pointing in our direction in the firing position. Worrying: Maidstone Crown Court, pictured, was told that Mr Ashfield appeared in the hallway of his home with a double barrel shotgun . 'He said: ""Get out of my house."" He pointed the gun towards my legs. He said: ""If you don't get out I am going to shoot you in the legs. 'My reaction was: ""That's fine, we will leave the house"". Asked by prosecutor Christopher May what was going through his mind, he replied: 'What was going through my mind was I was going to end up with no legs.' The bailiffs left the house, called the police and waited outside the gates. Mr Lawrence, who worked for Burlington Credit, denied a suggestion by William Clegg QC, defending, that they broke down a metre-high garden fence to get into the grounds. Mr Riddick said of the gun incident: 'I could see by his face he meant it. I was in a bit of a state and panicking. I was scared.' Mr Clegg told him: 'You could have been a couple of bandits.' Ashfield admitted possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence but disputed that he aimed the gun at the bailiffs. His solicitor and son-in-law Lucas Pitts said the writ resulted from a civil action in which the businessman was one of the defendants. He said of the bailiffs: 'I said it sounded like trespass. Their aim was to empty the house of everything they could lay their hands on. It was an unwarranted and insane idea. 'There was a Derby Bentley in one of the garages. Their eyes lit up at that point. A low loader was ordered (to take it away).' The court heard Ashfield's wife Francesca had just finished breakfast when the bailiffs arrived. Oil had been stolen from their property the previous day. The gun was used by their son for clay pigeon shooting. Saying she felt 'extremely vulnerable', she maintained the bailiffs had broken in by forcing the stock fence and damaging the hawthorn and holly hedge. Mrs Ashfield said she repeatedly asked them to leave the house before her husband told them: 'If I get a gun would that persuade you to leave?' She heard him say: 'And now will you leave?' 'I looked over my right shoulder and he was pointing at the floor,' she added. She denied that her husband either pointed the gun at the men or threatened to shoot one of them in the legs. Ashfield was sentenced to six months imprisonment suspended for two years with 150 hours unpaid work after Judge Martin Joy found he could not be sure what position the gun was held in. He said Ashfield, who also owns a gym in Brighton and is a co-driver in rallying with Vince Bristow, acted 'foolishly' by fetching the gun and could have calmed down at any stage. But he added the two bailiffs had been equally foolish, and even 'deceptive'. 'I do not find that the criminal standard of proof has been satisfied and I sentence on the basis that the defendant unwisely, foolishly, brought in a gun which was broken and not loaded,' said the judge. 'The defendant did by his actions threaten the two bailiffs and his actions were foolish, overdramatic, grandstanding and the bailiffs were behaving in a foolish and deceptive way and were not really frightened. 'All the parties over-reacted in what may be described as a childish and foolish way.' Judge Joy said Ashfield's behaviour would have caused fear but nothing like as first suggested by the bailiffs. He added that use of a firearm to threaten or intimidate could not be tolerated and there had to be a deterrent sentence. The bailiffs, he said, had broken into the property by knocking the fence down and going through the hedge. Their 'misbehaviour' went further and had fuelled the situation. He described them as 'incompetent and belligerent' and said it seemed remarkable to suggest they were experienced bailiffs. 'They lacked the professionalism and any understanding of the regulations concerning what they were permitted to do and their evidence was contradictory,' he said. 'Their attitude inflamed the situation and they went into the house completely uninvited. Mr Ashfield undoubtedly considered genuinely that he had been tricked, as he had.'","Burly enforcers went armed with a writ taken out against Jeffrey Ashfield .

Ed Miliband unveiled plans for a . ‘Robin Hood’ raid on wealthy homeowners to fund a restoration of the 10p . income tax rate yesterday. In his most significant  economic . policy announcement, the Labour leader said Gordon Brown’s decision to . abolish the starting rate of tax in 2008 had been a ‘mistake’. Mr Miliband said he wanted to  re-introduce a version of it. Tax rate: Labour leader Ed Miliband (pictured left, and right with Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, speaking to apprentices at the Bedford Training Group) wants to reintroduce the 10p tax rate . Speech: Mr Miliband today said the 10p tax rate could be paid for with a mansion tax on homes worth more than £2m . Plans: Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls (left) has offered to sit down with the Lib Dems to work out how the mansion tax could be brought in . However, his proposals came under broad attack last night amid doubts over how much his proposed ‘mansion tax’ would raise. The Institute for Fiscal Studies, the . UK’s leading economic forecaster, said Mr Miliband’s proposal had ‘no . plausible economic justification’, while David Cameron said it had . clearly been ‘cobbled together overnight’. Treasury sources said that  everyone . who had paid the old 10p rate of tax already paid no tax at all, thanks . to the Coalition’s decision to increase the threshold for income tax to . £9,440. In a speech in Bedford, Mr Miliband . endorsed Liberal Democrat proposals – blocked by the Tories – for an . annual levy on properties worth £2million or more. Rebuild: Mr Miliband and Mr Balls speak to apprentices at the Bedford Training Group, following the speech on Labour's plans for rebuilding the economy if they were to regain power . Unexpected: The announcement on the 10p tax rate was a surprise inclusion in the address today, which had been billed as featuring no significant policy . Workers: Mr Miliband said the move would put Labour 'where it should always have been - on the side of working people' On Wednesday, David  Cameron strongly hinted that he was thinking of  reinstating the 10p tax band so disastrously scrapped  by Gordon Brown. So how did that cynical opportunist Ed Miliband  respond? He stole the idea and inserted it, at the 11th hour, into yesterday’s otherwise utterly lacklustre speech on the economy. To pay for it, he then went rummaging through the Lib Dem policy book, disinterring Nick Clegg’s unworkable plan for a ‘mansion tax’. As we have long argued, it would be impossible to introduce such a levy without punishing widows or pensioners who live in larger homes, but have only a modest income. What is most depressing however, is Mr Miliband’s refusal to acknowledge that, if Britain is to emerge from recession, it must encourage entrepreneurs – not clobber them with punitive taxes. He said it would be used to create a new 10p tax band, the size of which would be determined by how much revenue was raised. However, aides said that Mr Miliband . envisaged a 10p tax band  on up to the first £1,000 of income above the . tax-free threshold – worth £100 a year to 23.5million basic rate . taxpayers. The threshold for the 40p band would be reduced to ensure . that higher rate taxpayers do not benefit – sucking more families into . that tax band. ‘We would tax houses worth over £2million,’ Mr Miliband said. ‘And we would use the money to cut taxes for working people. ‘We would put right a mistake made by Gordon Brown and the last Labour Government.’ The IFS said that to raise sufficient . sums to pay for a 10p band covering the first £1,000 of income, an . annual levy of £30,000 would have to be raised from every  homeowner . with a property worth £2million or more. There would also need to be a . nationwide revaluation of property values, at least at the top end. Critics said this would mean the return of council ‘snoopers’ logging . every detail of people’s homes that might increase their worth. Mr Miliband’s move came a day after Mr . Cameron mocked him in the Commons, reading out an invitation to his . speech which warned that it would contain no new policy announcements. The Prime Minister also hinted that . the Tories might reintroduce a 10p starting rate of tax, an idea which . has been considered in the Treasury for some time. Budget: Tory backbenchers want the 10p rate to be brought back in next month's Budget. Taking questions in the House Mr Cameron appeared to hint he was open to the idea . Campaigning in the Eastleigh byelection, the Prime Minister said he was not worried about Mr Miliband’s pledge. Labour denied Tory claims that Mr . Miliband’s tax plan had been hastily assembled, saying they had been . working on it for months. In 2008, Mr Miliband defended Labour’s . abolition of the 10p tax band, saying: ‘Some people do lose out... but . overall these changes make the tax system fairer.’ Where is the brotherly love?: Ed Miliband's plans would mean that his house, left, would just miss out on having to pay the tax at a value of £1.9 million, whereas his brother David's house, right, would be taxed at £2.3 million . The IFS said that the proposal would ‘complicate the income tax system and achieve nothing that could not be better achieved in other ways’, pointing out that governments of both complexions had introduced and then abolished lower starting rates of tax. ‘To propose the same thing again suggests a remarkable failure to learn from history,’ the institute added.

Police are believed to be working on the theory that one of them might . have died of shock after discovering that their spouse had died. The . couple had been married for 50 years. Location: The bodies were discovered at a property in Caister-on-Sea, Norfolk, after police forced their way in . The alarm was raised by window cleaner Roy Holland who got no reply when . he called at their detached home at around noon on Tuesday and saw milk . bottles building up on their doorstep. He peeped through the blinds on the front window and saw Mr Ellis, a . retired market trader and driving instructor, slumped in a chair. Mr Holland, 39 alerted police who broke in through the front door and . found the couple dead in their bungalow in . Caister-on-Sea near Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. Officers at first suspected that the couple might have died from carbon . monoxide poisoning due to a faulty heating system and called in Norfolk . Fire Service to make sure the bungalow was safe. Firemen wearing breathing apparatus went into the two bedroom home and . carried out tests for the gas with the specialist equipment before . declaring it was safe to enter. Norfolk Police confirmed that a post mortem today revealed . that the woman was believed to have died from natural causes. 'I knew . something was wrong when I saw all the police, fire and ambulance . vehicles at the scene. They were a very quiet couple and their deaths . are a mystery. I am really shocked' Neighbour David Dyer, 62 . Further toxicology tests are due to be carried out on the bodies, but . sources suggested that Mr Ellis was also likely to have died from . natural causes. A Norfolk Police spokeswoman confirmed that officers were not looking for anyone else in connection with the tragedy. She added: 'Neither of the deaths are being treated as suspicious. 'Formal identification is still due to take place and a file has been . passed to the Coroner with an inquest opening in due course. 'There is no evidence to suggest at this time that either death was due to carbon monoxide poisoning.' The bungalow which is about a mile from the sea remained sealed off today while a police investigation into the deaths of the . couple continued. It is believed that there were not any signs of a disturbance in the bungalow or obvious injury to the couple. Investigation: Officers are awaiting the results of post mortems on the couple which were being carried out on the couple today and were trying to trace their next of kin . Retired draughtsman Geoffrey Sutton, 74, who lives next door to the . couple said: 'It is a terrible tragedy. They were a lovely couple who . were devoted to each other. 'I had not seen them for a week or two and I had assumed they were staying in during the cold spell. 'The window cleaner realised something was wrong when he called round to . do their windows. He couldn’t get an answer so he came round to see me. 'I think there were about six pints of milk on the doorstep. I tried phoning them, but I couldn’t get any reply. 'The window cleaner then peered in the window through a gap in the venetian blinds and said, ""I can see him. He is dead"". 'The police arrived and called through the letter box to see if they . could raise anyone in there and they thought they could smell gas. 'I . tried phoning them, but I couldn't get any reply. The window cleaner . then peered in the window through a gap in the venetian blinds and said, . “I can see him. He is dead""' Neighbour Geoffrey Sutton, 74 . 'They had quite a job breaking the door down. I know Barry was pretty security conscious so his home was very secure. 'I saw a couple of firemen go in with breathing apparatus and I . overheard some discussion at the scene that it might be a case of carbon . monoxide poisoning. 'I know that they had an oil-fired central heating system. 'They always went out together and they never seemed to have any visitors. They just kept themselves to themselves. 'I don’t think they had any children, but I recall Jean saying that she . had several brothers and was the only girl in her family. They had lived . in the bungalow for many years.' Window cleaner Mr Holland, 39, who first raised the alarm, described Mr and Mrs Ellis as a 'a lovely, friendly couple'. He said: 'It was quite a shock. It’s not something which you like to see - it’s a thought that won’t go away for quite a while. Concern: The alarm was raised by a window cleaner who, after receiving no reply when he called and saw milk bottles lined up on their doorstep, looked through the blinds on the front window . 'You get to know your customers and if they are in or out. Both cars . were in the drive. There were six pints of milk on the doorstep and the . neighbours said they hadn’t seen them for days. 'I then decided to take a look through the window and saw the gentleman . sitting in the chair. They never went anywhere without each other so if . the gentleman was in, it was likely his wife was at home too.' Mr Holland said he had cleaned the couple’s windows for around ten years and had never known them to go away on holiday. He added: 'I am a bit overwhelmed by this. It’s a terrible thing to happen.' Mr and Mrs Ellis who are thought to have lived in their bungalow for . around 30 years used to run a stall selling clothing and underwear at . Great Yarmouth market. Thoughts with families: Great Yarmouth MP Brandon Lewis told MailOnline he was 'shocked' A fellow market trader said: 'They were very quiet and did not mix with a . lot of people. I think they must have given up their stall about . ten-years-ago. They were here for quite a few years.' A neighbour of the couple said Mr Ellis had previously worked as a . driving instructor. The couple are thought to have celebrated their . Golden Wedding anniversary after 50 years marriage last year. David Dyer, 62, who lives opposite, said: 'I knew something was wrong . when I saw all the police, fire and ambulance vehicles at the scene. 'They were a very quiet couple and their deaths are a mystery. I am really shocked.' Norfolk Fire and Rescue Service spokesman Martin Barsby said: 'We sent a . heavy rescue pump vehicle carrying gas analysis equipment to the . incident. 'We needed to check that it was safe for police and paramedics to enter the property.' The normally peaceful coastal village of Caister-on-Sea popular is . popular with holidaymakers for its long sandy beach and is home to many . retired people. Brandon Lewis, the MP for Great Yarmouth constituency, which includes Caister, said he was shocked by the deaths. The Conservative MP, a minister in Eric Pickles’ Department of . Communities and Local Government, said: 'This sounds like a terrible . tragedy and my first thoughts are with the families of the deceased. I . shall be keeping informed of events.'","Police forced their way into property yesterday in Caister-on-Sea, Norfolk .

An asteroid capable of destroying London has successfully skimmed past the Earth. The 150ft, 130,000 ton chunk of space rock was the nearest flyby for an object of this size since records began. Although scientists said there was little chance of asteroid 2012 DA14 hitting our planet - if it did, it would have inflicted 1,000 times more damage than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Its closest approach, passing within . 17,000 miles (27,357 kilometers), which is closer than some satellites, was at 7.25pm, GMT. Close shave: An asteroid capable of destroying London has successfully skimmed past the Earth. This image, taken in Australia, shows the huge piece of space rock at it nears Earth . Frightening: The 150ft, 130,000 ton chunk of space rock was the nearest flyby for an object of this size since records began . Huge: This image shows how scientists think the Asteroid looks . The flyby occurred just hours after a much smaller meteor exploded above Russia's Ural Mountains. Astronomers say the two events were coincidental, and the objects were . traveling in opposite directions. The asteroid delighted astronomers in Australia and elsewhere who watched it zip harmlessly through a clear night sky. 'It's on its way out,' reported Paul Chodas of NASA. The asteroid was too small to see with the naked eye even at its closest approach over the Indian Ocean near Sumatra. The best viewing locations, with binoculars and telescopes, were in Asia, Australia and eastern Europe. Even there, all anyone could see was a pinpoint of light as the asteroid buzzed by at 17,400 mph (28,000 kph). As asteroids go, this one was relatively small. The one that wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago was 6 miles across. Fast: This image shows the asteroid as it travels through the sky. It is the white dot in the middle of picture . Speedy: Asteroid 2012 DA14 shoots through the night sky as it passes by closely to Earth in Manila, Philippines . But this rock could still do immense . damage if it ever struck given its 143,000-ton heft, releasing the . energy equivalent of 2.4 million tons of TNT and wiping out 750 square . miles. By comparison, NASA estimated that . the meteor that exploded over Russia was much smaller - about 49 feet . (15 meters) wide and 7,000 tons before it hit the atmosphere, or . one-third the size of the passing asteroid. Speaking about the back-to-back events, Jim Green, NASA's director of planetary science, said: 'This is indeed very rare and it is historic. 'These fireballs happen about once a . day or so, but we just don't see them because many of them fall over the . ocean or in remote areas. This one was an exception.' Close: This NASA graphic shows the trajectory of the asteroid. The green line shows the moment it reached its closest point to Earth, at about 7.25pm UK time . Dave Herald, an amateur astronomer in Murrumbateman, Australia, captured the asteroid - seen here as the black line as it moves across the sky/ The three minute exposure shows the fast movement of Asteroid 2012 DA14 seven hours before closest approach. At its closest approach, the object will be moving so fast as to cover this distance in approximately 15 seconds. Disaster: This graphic shows the sequence of events which led to a meteor crashing in Russia yesterday . The asteroid was invisible to astronomers in the United States at the . time of its closest approach on the opposite of the world. But in . Australia, astronomers used binoculars and telescopes to watch the point . of light speed across the clear night sky. The asteroid cut through the orbit of . some satellites used for weather forecasting and for satellite phones . and television. This afternoon it was spotted by amateur astronomer Dave Herald in, Murrumbateman, Australia. Asteroid 2012 DA14 is seen as a streak running almost vertically at centre of the image. Close shave: Asteroid 2012 DA14 will pass just 17,100 miles from Earth at around 7.30pm. 'In astronomical . terms, that's very close,' said astronomer and asteroid expert Daniel . Brown of Nottingham Trent University . It is a three-minute min exposure, with the asteroid seen at -82.5 degrees and heading south. The streak is quite regular - indicating no major brightness variations over a time scale of three minutes. At closest approach, the object was moving so fast as to cover this distance in approximately 15 seconds. Donald . Yeomans, manager of NASA's Near-Earth Object program at the Jet . Propulsion Lab, has insisted: 'No Earth impact is possible.' A few hundred satellites orbit at 22,300 miles, higher than the asteroid's path, but scientists say the chance of it hitting one is extremely remote. Nevertheless, satellite operators have been warned . However, . he added, its journey through space will bring it so close to our . planet that stargazers from Europe to Australia will be able to see it . with just a pair of binoculars. 'This flyby will provide a unique opportunity for researchers to study a near-Earth object up close.' The . half-hour broadcast from the agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in . Pasadena, California, included a real-time animation to show the . location of the asteroid in relation to Earth. There . were also live or near real-time views of the asteroid from . observatories in Australia. Scientists have never observed such a narrow miss before. Through . binoculars, the object was visible as a tiny dot of light . crossing the sky. It was recommended to look towards the north-east . horizon around two hours after sunset. Disturbance: . This graphic depicts the trajectory . of asteroid 2012 DA14 as it flies past Earth tonight. This view looks . down from above the North Pole and shows how it will pass inside the . ring of geo-stationary satellites . 'It . will be too faint for the naked eye but with binoculars it should be . visible if you know where to look. It will be low to the north-eastern . horizon and moving quite quickly,' he said. 'You’ll . be able to see it pass from the constellation Leo to roughly the . Plough, more or less from anywhere in the UK, and it will be bright for . about an hour.' Asteroid . 2012 DA14 belongs to dangerous family of near-Earth objects (NEOs) that . are small enough to be missed but large enough to cause serious damage. It . was discovered in February last year by La Sagra Observatory in . southern Spain as it fell under the spotlight of the Sun’s rays, and has . been closely tracked ever since. Travelling . at between 12,427mph and 18,641mph  the asteroid will fly inside the . orbits of high geostationary satellites some 22,000 miles above the . Earth. These are the . satellites that provide us with telecommunications and weather . forecasts,' said Dr Brown. 'There are loads of them but you’re talking . about a very big area. It would be very unlucky if a satellite was hit. 'The . asteroid is more likely to hit some space junk, but most of this is . only about a centimetre across and the impact won’t even be noticed.' The asteroid posed no danger to . the International Space Station, which orbits at an altitude of only a . few hundred kilometres. The . 150ft-wide, 130,000-ton asteroid is considered small as these things go. By contrast, the one that took out the dinosaurs 65million years ago . was 6 miles wide. Precise calculations showed there was absolutely no possibility of DA14 hitting the Earth, Dr Brown said. But . scientists had a good idea of what the effect of such an impact would . be because a similar sized meteor devastated a remote region of Siberia . in 1908. Exploding a short distance above the ground over Tunguska, the object generated a blast equivalent to 2.4million tons of TNT. Forest was completely flattened over an area of 830 square miles. 'We think the object that impacted at Tunguska would have been of a similar size to DA14,' said Dr Brown. 'Actually, . it exploded in the air. It didn’t destroy humanity, but if this object . had exploded over London it would have wiped out London. 'It’s not a global impact, but it’s a severe impact.' The likelihood of something this size striking Earth is once in every 1,200 years; a close encounter like this is thought to occur every 40 years. During the flypast, scientists will use radar to study DA14 and learn about its composition and structure. The knowledge could prove useful if steps have to be taken to remove the threat of another space rock. The 'Hollywood option' of blowing up an incoming asteroid has been ruled out by experts. Such a dramatic solution would only result in deadly debris raining down on Earth so scientists are instead looking at ways of gently nudging an asteroid onto a safer trajectory. The bulk of the solar system's asteroids are located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, and remain stable there for billions of years. Some occasionally pop out, though, into Earth's neighbourhood.","The 130,000 ton chunk of space rock was its closed to Earth at 7.25pm, GMT .

Conviction: Award-winning film and theatre designer Christopher Giles pleasured himself in front of a lone female rail passenger, a court heard today . An award-winning film and theatre designer pleasured himself in front of a lone female rail passenger, a court heard today. Christopher Giles, 43, undid his trousers in front of the shocked woman while alone with her in a central London train carriage. As he began to pleasure himself, he told the woman: 'Might as well have fun, the trains are slow today.' The Brussels-born designer and former ballet dancer had followed the woman onto the train at Moorgate Station, Westminster Magistrates' Court heard. Prosecutor Darren Watts said: 'She was reading a newspaper and the defendant decided to sit relatively close to her. 'The defendant said to her: ""You are a very pretty lady"". 'Initially the complainant ignored the defendant and continued to read the newspaper, but the defendant repeated it several times. 'Eventually she responded by saying ""I know"" in order to stop the defendant from talking.' Giles then moved directly opposite the woman, undid his trousers and began to pleasure himself, the court heard. 'The complainant clearly saw the defendant's penis', said Mr Watts. 'He then said to her: ""Might as well have fun, the trains are slow today"". 'The complainant felt disgusted and immediately feared for her safety as there was no one else in the carriage.' The woman was afraid to flee the . train immediately after the incident at 9.30am, for fear that Giles . would follow her, but she managed to move to an adjacent carriage. She got off the train at Hornsey and alerted station staff to the incident. In the dock: Westminster Magistrates' Court, pictured, heard that the Brussels-born designer and former ballet dancer had followed the woman onto the train . Giles was arrested on January 15 this year for the offence after being spotted by train staff who had been given a description of him. He was described in court as a freelance theatre designer and the father of two grown-up children who is currently in a relationship. Giles was the principal dancer with the Leeds-based Northern Ballet Theatre for 11 years, between 1993 and 2004, before moving behind the scenes as a production designer. He continued to work in ballet circles as a set and costume designer, receiving training at the Royal Opera House while adding an impressive list of shows to his CV. His 2010 credits include set design for a production of Genoveva at the Bloomsbury Theatre, and set and costumes for Bells are Ringing at the Union Theatre in Southwark. At the 2010 Barcelona International Film Festival, Giles scooped an award for Best Art Direction for his work on short film 'Beware Of What You Wish For'. Giles, wearing a purple tartan jacket in the dock, told the court he regretted the incident, which took place on December 18 last year,  and described it as 'misguided flirting'. District Judge Sally Fudge handed Giles a fine as he has no previous convictions or cautions for similar offences. 'People should be allowed to expect to travel without disturbances on public transport', she told him. 'Whatever possessed you to behave this way on that morning, I hope it never happens again. 'It must have been very upsetting for the young lady. 'It is not right to behave that way, whatever was going through your head.' He was ordered to pay a £350 fine and a £35 victim surcharge. Giles, of Mitcham, Surrey, admitted outraging public decency.","Christopher Giles, 43, repeatedly told the woman 'You are a very pretty lady'

There are few more relaxing things in life than putting your feet up and enjoying a quiet cup of tea in the sunshine. But when two sisters decided to enjoy a brew together while on holiday, it turned out to be a far from relaxing experience. Despite holidaying at the Happy Valley caravan site things quickly turned nasty between the siblings. Scarred: Patricia Morris, 68, and her sister Christine Doyle started arguing over tea.

Patricia Morris, 68, and her sister Christine Doyle . began to have a 'petty sibling argument' while enjoying their tea - . only for grandmother Morris to smash a china teacup into Mrs Doyle's . face. It has left the 66-year-old scarred for life - but at Cardiff Crown Court today she begged a judge not to jail her sister. Speaking after the case, the tearful mother-of-one said: 'She brought that cup down so hard on my face that my cheek flapped open. 'The police officers who interviewed me said it looked like a knife wound. 'Blood spurted out everywhere, I was horrified. I was in such shock. She never said sorry, she just stared.' Retired factory worker Christine said it was the first time they'd had a fall out and had always been 'close'. Scene of crime: The Happy Valley campsite in Porthcawl, South Wales, is pictured . Falling out: The sisters were on holiday in adjacent caravans at the campsite . She said: 'We shared a room at home until Patricia got married - I was a bridesmaid at her wedding. 'Now I am glad to see her punished but could never see my sister go to jail. 'That day she just lost it. I didn't recognise her. 'She still hasn't apologised even though my statement saved her from jail.'

Prosecutor John Probert told Cardiff Crown Court: 'They were regular visitors to the site and until that point they had got on perfectly well all their lives. Forgiveness: The incident left 66-year-old Christine Doyle scarred for life - but at Cardiff Crown Court today she begged a judge not to jail her sister . 'But . the sisters began arguing after Mrs Morris said she was going to take . her disabled husband for a shower in the ladies washrooms. 'Mrs Doyle thought that was inappropriate and an argument started. 'Mrs Morris threw her tea over her sister who reciprocated. 'Mrs Morris then came towards her sister and brought her teacup down onto her forehead.' The court heard the blow caused two small wounds to her eyebrow and jaw and a huge gash down her left cheek. Mrs Doyle was taken to hospital and transferred to a specialist plastic surgery unit where she had 35 stitches inserted in her face. Judge Stephen Hopkins said: 'It is somewhat ironic that this happened at the Happy Valley caravan site.' The judge said Mrs Doyle's plea had saved her sister from an 'inevitable prison sentence'. He told Morris: 'You don't deserve a sister as generous in spirit as yours.' Morris, of Blackwood, South Wales, was given a 12-month suspended sentence afteradmitting wounding. Joanna James, defending, said: 'It was a momentary act of sheer stupidity after what was a petty sibling argument.

They couldn’t believe what had happened. ‘They tell me keep talking to him, I was calling to him, there was no response, I said I know my son is dead. He is dead.’ Kevin had already fallen from the third floor of his family home in Southall, west London a year earlier. The inquest head he thought he was 'invincible' after . surviving the fall. He escaped uninjured, but Mrs Morais . said she had called her landlord to check the windows because her . ‘naughty boy’ loved climbing on anything. A statement from PC James Rose said: . ‘I spoke to the family friends and they explained how Kevin loved . Spider-Man and had jumped from a window two years previously and had . suffered only a scratch and this may have made him think he was . invincible.’ Dad John Morais, who is a builder, . told the inquest he felt the windows could open too easily when he . examined them after Kevin’s death. ‘After all that tragedy when I came up to the window I found with a push it opened easily,’ he said. Awful: This is the window from where the 6-year-old fell . ‘I don’t want to create any . speculation that is beyond my understanding, but one thing is for sure . because of one window that was supposed to be locked I lost my son. I . hope it doesn’t happen to any other family.’ When asked by the coroner if he had . anything to add he said: ‘Just end everything, because whatever, nothing . is going to bring my son back.’ Mrs Morais had not touched the window . since saying: ‘Its too painful for me to go near the window, the only . thing I do every day in that room is open the curtains and close the . curtains. ‘I just want this to be over its too painful for me to go through this.’ But PC Katie Dunford, one of the first on the scene, told the inquest there was only a small gap. ‘I could see the left window was open . and the window had a safety feature which prevented them from opening . fully, and I remember thinking at the time I didn’t know how a child . could fit through that gap, because it was only a small gap,’ she said. Detective Sergeant Fiona Hepworth confirmed there were no suspicious circumstances or neglect issues relating to the death. Coroner Lorna Tagliavini ordered the housing association A B Dominion Homes to examined the safety catches on their windows to avoid another tragedy after the inquest was unable to establish exactly how Kevin had fallen. She said: ‘It is quite clear that very tragically Kevin managed to get out but the circumstances are not clear. ‘We simply do not know whether there was a small gap, a large gap or whether there was a fault that needs to be addressed. ‘I am concerned that as these are standard windows in a large number of properties that there is potential for a repeat occurrence to happen.’ He was flown to hospital by air ambulance after the accident on March 6 2011, but died the following day. Director of Property Services for the . company, who run 35,000 homes, David Lingeman said that incident . occurred when the property was owned by a different company. He said the window had not been examined since the death out of respect to the family. He confirmed it was there responsibility to ensure they were safe. The coroner added: ‘I have found on . the balance of probabilities he was climbing on the windowsill and . either fell against the window or opened it sufficiently for him to fall . through.

No circus in the UK will feature performing lions or tigers for the first time in living memory this year. The milestone follows new restrictions on circuses using animals coming into force last month ahead of an outright ban. The last big top to feature big cats, the Great British Circus, has moved its tigers to an operator in Ireland, as the travelling circus season gets under way. Big top: Martin Lacey performs with lion at the Great British Circus, which no longer uses big cats . Animals have been used in circuses since the 18th Century and around 20 were using them in 2000. But the Coalition has promised to fulfill the previous Government's pledge and outlaw it altogether. The restrictions implemented so far force circuses to fulfill various licensing conditions, including regular veterinary visits and 'retirement plans for the animals'. Only two companies have applied for licences - to keep camels, zebras and reindeer - since the new rules were introduced. Milestone: This Bengal tiger will not be featuring this year at the Great British Circus . The first modern circus to feature animals was in 1768, when horses were used. Exotic animals from around the world were added as the British Empire expanded. Mane attraction: Lions and tigers were being used to advertising the Great British Circus in 2008 . Animal rights campaigners have hailed the milestone as the beginning of the end forthe use of wild animals in UK circuses. Animal Defenders International chief executive Jan Creamer told The Observer: 'There has been enough evidence, enough consultations, all the experts agree - putting large cats and other exotic animals in tiny cages and beating them to perform tricks to entertain people is unacceptable in modern society. The day of the animal circus is over.' But David Jamieson, editor of King Pole circus magazine, said there are good examples of trainers on treating animals very well in Europe, where they are still a popular attraction. He added: 'They're doing very interesting displays. It's not the old old style of a man with a whip and a chair. 'These are sensitive displays that show the animals' affection for humans and humans' affections for animals.' The Great British Circus sent its tigers to Courtney Brothers Circus in Ireland, which made headlines last year when one of its elephants escaped and ran through Cork, and one of its trainers was later crushed by open of the animals. The loss of toges and lions also follows the prosecution of Bobby Robers last year. He became the first circus owner to be found guilty under the Animal Welfare Act for mistreating an elephant. Only around five of Britain's 30 travelling big tops use animals, with aerobatics taken more of the limelight.","The last big top in Britain to feature big cats has moved its tigers to Ireland .

Troubled: A new biography has revealed that poet Sylvia Plath tried to cut her throat at the age of 10 . Poet Sylvia Plath tried to cut her throat at the age of 10 - two decades before the troubled writer killed herself, a new biography has claimed. The revelation about the American novelist's troubled childhood has emerged on the eve of the 50th anniversary of her death. Plath, who committed suicide when she was 30, had also cut her face four years later, having battled depression following the death of her father Otto when she was eight-years-old. The details of Plath's early years are revealed in a new biography, Mad Girl's Love Song, by author Andrew Wilson. He had access to previously unseen letters her mother Aurelia wrote to the poet's two children Frieda and Nicholas, who hardly knew Plath. Mr Wilson also saw an unpublished memoir by one of Plath's former boyfriends, Gordon Lameyer, and interviewed a number of her friends, who had remain silent until now. They included Philip McCurdy, who told Mr Wilson about his childhood friend's attempt at cutting her own throat. Mr Wilson told The Sunday Times: 'I think it is now what we now call self harming. But clearly something was very wrong.' The letters from Aurelia, who died in 1994, were uncovered when Mr Wilson found her neighbour Dorinda Cruickshank's home in Boston. Ms Cruickshank had died in 2007 but she had passed the collection onto her daughter. Many people had blamed Plath's suicide at her home in north London on her husband and fellow poet Ted Hughes. But Mr Wilson explained how the death of Otto had severely effected her many years earlier. He said: 'I suppose you could say she had an Electra complex. She adored him, but then hated him when he left her by dying.' In her poem Daddy, she referred to her . suicide attempt in 1953. She wrote: 'At twenty I tried to die / And get . back, back, back to you.' Scroll down for video . 'Angry young woman': Poet Sylvia Path pictured with son Nicholas Hughes and his sister Frieda . Plath, who was resentful of her poor background, also thought of her mother, with whom she shared a bedroom, as controlling. She went onto have numerous lovers, which Mr Wilson said was an attempt to find a substitute for her father. Mr Wilson tracked down her former boyfriend, Richard Sassoon, a relative of the poet Siegfried, who gave permission for his letters to be published. It allowed the biographer to piece together how his rejection of Plath led her to Hughes. He also found references in other writings to how Plath left psychiatric hospital following her suicide attempt with an 'unresolved illness'.

Dismissed: PC John Caulfield has been sacked for gross misconduct following accusations he chased and punched a teenager for urinating in bushes . A police constable has been sacked for using excessive force after he chased and punched a French student who had been urinating in bushes. PC John Caulfield, 33, has been dismissed for gross misconduct over the arrest in Hackney, north-east London, in August 2009. He was accused of chasing Charles Quichaud, then 19, and hitting him in the face. The officer said this was a legitimate technique to restrain him because he feared for his own safety. Mr Caulfield faced trial twice for assault occasioning actual bodily harm - the first jury failed to reach a verdict and the second cleared him. Today Mike Franklin, from police watchdog the Independent Police Complaints Commission (PCC), said: ‘A disciplinary panel has concluded on the balance of probabilities that PC Caulfield breached police professional standards in that his use of force was unnecessary, disproportionate and unreasonable and he has rightfully been dismissed. ‘The panel also found that his written account of the incident was false, misleading and inaccurate and was, in all likelihood, written to justify his excessive use of force. ‘This was a unique case in that the young man who was arrested, who suffered serious facial injury, did not lodge a complaint but PC Caulfield’s actions were witnessed by a local resident who was so disturbed by what he saw he contacted the IPCC to complain. ‘I would like to thank that resident, the victim in this case and the other witnesses from Hoxton Square that evening who willingly gave their time to give evidence in two criminal trials and this misconduct hearing. 'Without them, this officer would still be serving.’ A second officer, a female constable, who failed to write up what had happened quickly enough was given a written warning. Commander Allan Gibson, Directorate of Professional Standards at Scotland Yard, said: ‘There is no doubt that the actions of PC Caulfield brought discredit on the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) and, although acquitted at court, reflect badly on the thousands of officers who are honest and work tirelessly for the people of London. 'Unreasonable': The teenager who was arrested in Hoxton Square (pictured) suffered a facial injury . ‘The panel found his use of force was unnecessary, disproportionate and unreasonable and was additionally found to have produced a misleading written account of the incident. ‘Given the finding, there was only one appropriate outcome in this case and PC Caulfield was dismissed from the MPS without notice.’ Mr Quichaud was on a three-week holiday in London and had been drinking with a friend when the incident took place.","PC John Caulfield, 33, was dismissed for gross misconduct .

Jailed: Gareth Edwards, 33, was jailed for 26 months after grooming a 13-year-old girl for sex on Facebook . The leader of a spiritualist group who told a teenage girl she would make an 'excellent medium' while grooming her for sex on Facebook has been jailed. Gareth Edwards, 33, used his spiritualist church group to befriend the 13-year-old girl's family before trying to seduce her online. A court heard Edwards carried out a 'long campaign' of grooming, with more than 600 chat logs found between the two. The judge said it was 'every parent's nightmare', with Edwards using a degree of charm to gain the family's trust. He told the young girl she would be an 'excellent medium' before asking her to have sex with him on the social networking website. West Midlands Police arrested Edwards when the victim - who cannot be named for legal reasons - told them he tried to have sex with her in a car. Officers seized a computer and hard drive from his home in Coventry. On it they found a series of indecent videos, including one of a three-year-old girl being raped. Edwards, who lived with his mother, had admitted one charge of sexual assault and four of making indecent images, and was jailed for 26 months on Friday at Warwick Crown Court. Judge Sylvia de Bertodano said: 'You are here because of what happened with a 13-year-old girl. 'You made it clear that at a later stage you wished to have a sexual relationship, and you took advantage of her when you were in a car together. 'This was the culmination of a long campaign. To characterise it as just a kiss in a car does not begin to cover what really happened. 'This is every parent's nightmare because you managed to use a degree of personal charm to obtain the trust of her family. 'Long campaign': A judge at Warwick Crown Court (pictured) said it was 'every parent's nightmare' 'When you were arrested you were found . to have a small number of indecent images. This comes as no surprise, . because no matter how much you claim this was personal to her, the fact . remains you have a sexual interest in children. 'The images themselves are serious. They are video footage showing real situations; and the worst of them shows a girl of three being raped. 'They are images the vast majority of members of the public would find horrifying. Those are real children who are exploited for a market; and the market is created by people like you.' The court heard Edwards met the girl's family through his spiritual church group. Prosecutor Theresa Thorp said the online interactions between the two were initially about the girl's schoolwork, before Edwards asked her 'Would you kiss me? Would you hug me? Would you have sex with me?'. Antonie Muller, defending, said there was 'a body of information' on Edwards, who was described as 'a social and sexual inadequate' -  including psychiatric and pre-sentence reports. Grooming: A court heard more than 600 chat logs were found between Edwards and his 13-year-old victim . She said: 'He got qualifications on the internet and had a genuine interest in spiritualist groups. 'It is not a world he created to come into contact with young people. She stumbled into his world by accident. 'The messages are completely unrealistic romantic fantasies. This man, after all that, built himself up to kissing a 13-year-old girl on the lips once; and when he was rebuffed, it fizzled and died. 'He has come to realise there is a dividing line between fantasy and reality.' Edwards was ordered to register as a sex offender for 10 years and banned for life from doing any paid or voluntary work which brings him into contact with children.","Gareth Edwards befriended girl's parents through a spiritual church group .

Heirloom: John Holmes, from Dukes auctioneers, cleans the totem pole, which was being used as a coat stand but could fetch more than £100,000 . A Native American totem pole that has been used as a coat stand in a backroom in Britain for the past 30 years could be worth more than £100,000. The 6ft 7ins sculpture was bought by wealthy entrepreneur, John Allen Hughes, nearly a century ago from an indigenous tribe in the United States. The item was passed down through the family to his granddaughter, who was unaware of its value until an auctioneer stumbled across it, strewn with scarves and coats, in a backroom of her house. The auctioneer had been at the home in Dorset for a routine valuation of other household items when the sculpture caught their eye. The family heirloom was later identified as a rare Native American totem pole from the early 20th Century. Although it is estimated . to sell for up to £10,000, another model from the Haida natives fetched . more than £100,000 at an auction in New York in 2008. This particular artefact will be sold at Dukes auctions in Dorchester, Dorset, on Thursday next week. Mr Hughes is thought to have bought the pole from the Haida people as a memento of his trip to the U.S. and Canada in the 1920s, when he visited a number of tribes. The carved cedar trunk, which Mr Hughes had shipped back to Britain, features images of a whale, a bear and a beaver underneath an eagle, which is what tribesmen believe they are descended from. Native Americans engraved totem poles . to depict a series of events or to portray lineage through family, . which is what experts believe these particular animals represent. John Holmes, manager at Dukes, said: . 'John Allen Hughes was a very wealthy man and in the 1920s he did a tour . around North America. 'It seems like he bought the totem pole and shipped it back to the UK as a memento of the trip. 'The photograph pictures him with one of the tribes on his trip and would have been taken in central Northern America.

'This totem pole is most likely to represent family lineage and features a whale, bear, and beaver below the eagle.

The people of Dry Doddington are hopeful that the Grade II listed Church of St James's will bring tourists flocking to their picturesque corner of the country. Leaning tower: St James's Church in Dry Doddington tilts more than its famous Italian counterpart . Mystery: Unlike the people of Pisa, the Lincolnshire villagers do not know why their church tower leans . Villagers conducted the measurements using a linear system and discovered it tilts up to 5.1 degrees to the west, compared to Pisa's legendary tower, which leans 3.99 degrees to the south-east. They are keen to get independent experts to verify their findings and help solve the architectural mystery of what makes it lean. There are several theories as to how the . tower came to lean, one of which is that the soil that was supposed to . go under the building was used elsewhere instead, leaving it lop-sided. The tower in Tuscany was completed in . the 13th Century and began tilting during construction due to inadequate . foundations on ground that was too soft. It has since been . stabilised. St James's Church sits in view of a pub and has left many drinkers wondering if they have had one too many. The . church dates back to the 12th Century and the tower and spire were . added 200 years later. Dry Doddington has only 220 inhabitants and is . mentioned in the Domesday Book. Rivals: The tower at St James's Church leans 5.1 degrees compared to Pisa, which tilts 3.99 degrees . Among those hoping it will now attract curious sightseers from far and wide are Daniel Bland, 29, and his wife Kate, 34, who own the Wheatshead pub, which overlooks church. The couple, who have a daughter Eden, aged one, have owned the pub for six years and held their wedding at St James's Church in 2010. Mr Bland said: 'It would be fantastic if news of our leaning tower attracted lots of visitors because we have a fine view of the church from our pub. 'Strangers who drop in at the pub often notice the leaning tower and then joke they must have had too much to drink. 'The village's older residents say the tower has always had a tilt. They say it is because the church was built on a mound which has shifting soil. 'We know the ground doesn't shift due to ancient burials because the land surrounding the church is non-consecrated and contains no graves. Attraction: Wheatshef landlord Daniel Bland (left) and historian John Clark hope it will be popular with tourists . Double take: Mr Bland said that many drinkers have wondered if they have had one too many . 'We hold the key to the church and at the moment it gets just a few visitors, mainly from people wantIing to see a plaque inside the church which commemorates members of an aircrew who died when their Lancaster bomber crashed nearby in the war.' Mr Nick Poulson, 54, chairman of the Friends of St James's Church group, is setting up a local history society that will aim to learn more about the distinctive church's past and shed light on how and why the tower tilts. He said: 'It's an oddity and a well-kept secret, which is probably just as well because Dry Doddington wouldn't be able to accommodate all the tourists that would come to see it should it prove to leanmore than Pisa's tower. 'The tower in Pisa has been altered and is now at an angle of around 3.99 degrees, and although our tower still needs to be validated by a theodolite (an instrument for measuring angles) we estimate it leans 4.9 to 5.1 degrees. 'Although you have other striking church towers in England such as the Boston Stump and the crooked tower in Chesterfield, this is a quirky tower which we are proud of.' Anyone wanting to explore the village's quirky tower may have to wait, however, as it is desperately in need of repairs. Fingers crossed: Villagers are planning to have their findings independently verified by experts . Historic: St James's Church dates back to the 12 Century, with its tower and spire added 200 years later . Mr Poulson said: 'We need to raise at least £50,000 to carry out essential refurbishment. 'We will be applying to funds and for grants, and we are holding village events we hope can raise some money. 'We would love to get sponsorship from local businesses or organisations. We are also planning leaflets in the next few weeks with the information we know about the church.' Mr John Clark, 77, local resident and historian, said: 'We live with the tower and we are proud of it. It's a great landmark. I remember I couldn't believe my eyes when I first saw it as I drove off the A1. 'It's a source of great conversation in the local pub. We want it to be measured properly so we are looking for someone to come forward to help us with that.'","But the reason behind why the Grade II listed structure leans is a mystery .

A prostitute has claimed scandal-hit Senator Robert Menendez is a former client and that he still 'sees a lot of girls'. The New Jersey Democrat has previously been accused of sleeping with prostitutes in the Dominican Republic - allegations he has forcefully denied. Now the anonymous U.S. escort - who claims several senators have availed of her services - has identified Menendez in a photograph and said he paid her for sex. Claims: An escort has said scandal-hit Senator Robert Menendez is a former client . The woman, who is aged in her late 30s, told the Daily Caller she had been paid to provide services of a sexual nature to a number of U.S. senators, including a New Jersey Democrat and other, now deceased, politicians. The prostitute, who claimed there was significant demand for elite escorts among lobbyists, politicians and attorneys in Washington, said many of her customers use pseudonyms when contacting her. When the newspaper showed her a picture of Senator Menendez, she identified him as a former client. She described him as a 'hobbyist', a term she said was used to describe clients who see 'many girls, as many as they can'. 'He sees a lot of girls and doesn't seem to have the skills to have a relationship,' said the woman, who received no fee for her interview, according to the report. Senator Menendez's spokeswoman has not yet responded to the latest allegations. The politician previously denied that he engaged with prostitutes in the Dominican . Republic, and one of the women allegedly involved with him claims she . never even met the Democrat. Menendez told reporters . that he had done nothing wrong as he described 'anonymous, nameless, . faceless individuals' who have driven false stories into the mainstream . media. 'That's what they've . done successfully,' he said earlier this month in his first public remarks since the . allegations began to spread. 'The bottom line is all of those smears are . absolutely false.' Backing up his claims, 21-year-old Yaneisi Fernandez, who was allegedly hired as a prostitute by a longtime friend and campaign donor of Menendez, denied any participation in such activities. 'I’ve never been to Casa de Campo, I’ve never participated in those activities, don’t know those people or that man,' she told Univision of Menendez and his friend, Dr. Salomon Melgen. Menendez's office says he reimbursed Melgen (pictured) $58,500 on Jan. 4 for the full cost of two of three trips in 2010 in which Menendez took Melgen's plane to the Dominican Republic . Melgen and Menendez traveled together to the Dominican Republic in 2010. Menendez's public denial came after the FBI conducted a search of the West Palm Beach offices of a Florida doctor who also was the senator's biggest political donor in his re-election campaign last year. A week before the November election, The Daily Caller, a conservative website, reported that Menendez had used a business jet owned by Melgen to fly to the Dominican Republican for trysts with prostitutes. None of the allegations have been substantiated. It is unclear whether the FBI raid of Melgen's office was related to Menendez. The reports have dogged Menendez, 59, . as he has assumed the chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations . Committee, succeeding former Sen. John Kerry, who resigned last week to . become secretary of state. The Senate Ethics Committee is investigating . the case. Separately on . Monday, a prominent lawyer in the Dominican Republic denied claims that . he hosted outings involving Menendez and prostitutes on his yacht. Attorney Vinicio Castillo Seman said in Santo Domingo that he would seek . a criminal investigation into the source of the reports, which he . called 'absurd.' Castillo, . the son of a presidential adviser and the brother of a member of the . Dominican Republic Congress, said he has known Menendez for about 15 . years but has never seen him with a prostitute. Prostitution is legal in . the Caribbean country. 'I have never seen him behave in any way that was not impeccable and dignified,' Castillo said. FBI agents carry out boxes as law enforcement officials investigate the medical-office complex of Dr. Salomon Melgen who has ties to Menendez . While repeatedly denying any meetings . with prostitutes, Menendez did acknowledge to reporters that he flew on . Melgen's private plane and failed, initially, to properly pay for . trips. He told reporters he reimbursed some $58,500 from his personal . funds after it 'came to my attention' and said it was unfortunate that . the trips 'fell through the cracks.' 'I . was in a big travel schedule in 2010 as the chairman of the DSCC' — the . Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee — 'plus my own campaign . getting ready for the election cycle,' Menendez said. Menendez's . office said last week that the senator had reimbursed Melgen on Jan. 4. His office said Menendez's reimbursement was for the full cost of two . flights on Melgen's plane to the Dominican Republic for personal trips . in 2010. Menendez took a third . flight — in May 2010 — on Melgen's plane for a DSCC fundraiser. The . trip was reported to the Federal Election Commission as a $5,400 . expenditure by the DSCC for the use of Melgen's plane. These women claimed that Menendez and Melgen paid them for sex in an interview with the conservative website the Daily Caller . Melgen is a native of the Dominican Republic but has lived in the U.S. since 1980, while Menendez is of Cuban-American descent. He is divorced and has two children. Menendez's office has said Melgen has been a friend and supporter for many years. Some New Jersey Republicans filed a complaint with the Senate Ethics Committee last fall after The Daily Caller's initial report that Menendez had flown on Melgen's private plane to the Dominican Republic to engage with prostitutes. In response, Menendez's staffers searched records for trips by the senator and found the two additional trips that hadn't been reimbursed. In 2012, Melgen's practice gave $700,000 to Majority PAC, a super political action committee set up to fund Democratic candidates for Senate. Aided by Melgen's donation, the super PAC became the largest outside political committee contributing to Menendez's re-election, spending more than $582,000 on the senator's behalf, according to an analysis of federal election records .","Escort identified scandal-hit senator from a photograph .

Mother-of-three Tracey Smalley is celebrating an amazing weight loss achievement after shedding fifteen stone in six years. The primary school chef from Nottingham, who was affectionately known as 'Big Trace' by colleagues and friends, lost the weight after having a gastric band fitted and now weighs just 12 stone. Tracey started to put on weight after having children, now aged 28, 27 and 13 and says that she . tried every diet she had heard of in an effort to be thinner but finally underwent gastric band surgery after doctors told her she would die if she continued to grow. Tracey Smalley has lost 15 stone in weight since having a gastric band fitted and now fits in to size 12 clothes . Just after her 40th birthday, medics told Tracey that she needed to lose 10 stone - or risk dying before she was 50. She tried a series of crash diets and even weight loss pills, but despite successfully losing small amounts Tracey always piled the pounds back on. Tracey had a gastric band fitted five years ago in a last-ditch attempt to slim down to a healthy weight. After the surgery, Tracey's size dropped dramatically, and she now weighs 12 stone and fits in to a dress size 12/14. Tracey, who works at Forest Fields Primary School, Nottingham, said: 'After I had the three kids I just started putting the weight on. 'I'm not a lazy person, any one that knows me knows I'm not idle but I suppose my diet didn't help. 'I'm guilty of snacking on things at home, but whatever I tried to do to lose weight it didn't work. 'And I really did try, I don't want people to think that I didn't try different ways to lose weight, but I'm not going to say that I've never eaten chocolate or fatty foods, because I have. Tracey worked as a cook at Forest Fields Primary School but says she never ate at work, despite being surrounded by food . 'I feel better now, the doctors said to me ""if you don't lose 10 stone you'll be dead soon"". 'I thought that I wanted to get more out of life so I decided to lose the weight any way I could. 'The idea of not being there for my three kids was unbearable, I did it for them as much as myself. 'It might sound strange but I never ate at work. Even though I was surrounded by food I never got hungry. 'It used to gorge on chocolate and crisps when I got home from work and the weight just piled on and on.' Though her surgery was paid for by the NHS, Tracey had to spend £7,350 of her own cash to have excess saggy skin removed from her arms and stomach. She is now saving up to have a procedure on her legs so that they match her new body shape. According to the Department of Health, a gastric banding - where a band is used to reduce the size of the stomach - can cost anywhere between £5,000 and £8,000. A gastric bypass - where the digestive system is re-routed past most of the stomach - costs between £9,500 and £15,000.","Tracey Smalley weighed 27 stone at her heaviest .

'If a robot goes wrong, who is accountable?': Professor Noel Sharkey called for a pre-emptive ban on killer robots . Killer robots were once confined to Hollywood films or the pages of science-fiction novels. But with growing advances in technology, scientists warn that warfare could be conducted by autonomous weapons within a generation. Noel Sharkey, a professor of artificial intelligence and robotics at Sheffield University, said global action was needed to control their development. The technology is being developed in an unregulated environment, while the machines would struggle to distinguish between a child holding an ice-cream cone and a man with a gun, leading to the indiscriminate loss of civilian life, said Dr Sharkey. 'There is no transparency, no legal process. The laws of war allow for rights of surrender, for prisoner of war rights, for a human face to take judgments on collateral damage. 'Humans are thinking, sentient beings. If a robot goes wrong, who is accountable? Certainly not the robot,' said Dr Sharkey. Unmanned drones fitted with missiles, controlled from military bases by a human operator, have already been extensively used in Afghanistan and Pakistan to target militants. But they have proved controversial, with claims they are also responsible for large numbers of civilian casualties. Joined by other activists, including Nobel peace prize winners, Dr Sharkey is set to launch the 'Stop the Killer Robots' campaign at the House of Commons in April, calling for a pre-emptive ban on autonomous weapons. Many of the campaigners have already lobbied for international action on cluster bombs and landmines. 'These things are not science fiction; . they are well into development,' Dr Sharkey said in an interview with . the Observer. 'The research wing of the Pentagon in the US is working on . the X47B [unmanned plane] which has supersonic twists and turns with a . G-force that no human being could manage, a craft which would take . autonomous armed combat anywhere in the planet. Call of Duty: Experts say the U.S. is already courting young gamers to operate autonomous weapons . The U.S. is already training more drone pilots than real aircraft pilots, according to Professor Noel Sharkey . 'In America they are already training more drone pilots than real aircraft pilots, looking for young men who are very good at computer games. 'They are looking at swarms of robots, with perhaps one person watching what they do.' He added: 'Autonomous robotic weapons won't get tired, they won't seek revenge if their colleague is killed, but neither will my washing machine. No one on your side might get killed, but what effect will you be having on the other side, not just in lives but in attitudes and anger?' Despite huge advancements in programming, scientists have been unable to get a robot to distinguish between friend or foe, 'We are struggling to get them to distinguish between a human being and a car. The U.S. is said to be courting youngsters who are gaming wizards to operate autonomous weapons . 'We have already seen utter incompetence in the use of drones, operators making a lot of mistakes and not being properly supervised,' he said. Last year, campaign group Human Rights Watch (HRW) produced a 50-page report 'Losing Humanity: The Case Against Killer Robots' outlining their concerns about fully automated weapons. 'Giving machines the power to decide who lives and dies on the battlefield would take technology too far,' said Steve Goose from HRW. 'Human control of robotic warfare is essential to minimizing civilian deaths and injuries.'","Professor Noel Sharkey warns against  autonomous weapons development .

Aviation authorities are investigating a serious incident at Dublin Airport in which a Ryanair plane taxied the wrong way down a runway on which other planes were about to land. Ryanair flight FR227, from ­London Stansted to Dublin, missed its exit and made a 180-degree turn at the end of the runway, before heading back the way it had come – causing other flights to abort or delay landings, the Irish Mail on Sunday can reveal. Dramatic recordings of Air Traffic Control communications, which have been heard by the MoS, describe how the Ryanair flight had to ‘brake hard’. Other planes were ordered ‘go around’. Incident: A Ryanair plane caused huge disruption at Dublin airport after it missed its exit and taxied the wrong way down a runway other flights were about to land on . The Irish Aviation Authority is investigating the incident, in which FR227 attempted another unauthorised turn before being directed onto another exit. After the incident, another Ryanair plane, EI-DWR, addressed as Three Whiskey Romeo, asks the tower: ‘What was wrong with the runway?’ The control tower replies: ‘Well what happened was one of your company aircraft landed on runway 28, appeared to be going to the very end of the runway and just before they got to Bravo 7 [a runway exit], they made a 180 degree turn which, eh, just screwed every­thing.’ A statement from the IAA revealed that the incident was being treated seriously. ‘The Irish Aviation Authority is investigating an incident at Dublin Airport on February 15 where an aircraft that landed and was cleared to vacate the runway, completed a 180 degree turn back down the runway,’ said a spokesman. ‘There were other aircraft on approach to land on this runway, which were being monitored by air traffic control and as the other aircraft was still on the runway these aircraft were instructed to perform a missed approach.’ The authority said that an investigation was an ‘entirely normal procedure’ in such circumstances ‘to avoid any safety issues arising for passengers or aircraft’. The Irish Aviation Authority is now investigating the incident at Dublin Airport, pictured, on February 15 . The statement continues: ‘Prior to any further landings, an inspection of the runway was conducted by the airport authority to ensure the runway was available for use. This again is a normal procedure. Shortly thereafter, the runway was reopened and operations resumed.’ Ryanair confirmed that it was aware of the incident. A spokesman said: ‘This incident was reported by Ryanair to the IAA and we are co-operating fully with their enquiries. We have nothing further to add to the IAA statement.’ On the recordings, the control tower is heard instructing an Aer Lingus flight from Paris: ‘529, you’re going to have to go around too. The runway has to be inspected and if you can maintain present heading please and maintain 2,000ft.’ In the incident, FR-227 had been cleared to land on Runway 28. After landing, air traffic control called the crew and requested they ‘expedite vacating the runway’ which the crew acknowledged. Almost immediately, the incredulous­-sounding controller asked the crew: ‘227, have you made a 180?’. The response from the crew was: ‘Affirm.’ The controller immediately alerted the next incoming aircraft, Aer Lingus flight EI-249 from London Gatwick, telling it: ‘Go around.’ Serious incident: An Aer Lingus plane was forced to abort its landing when it was less than a minute from touchdown and fly around Dublin airport to come in from another approach . The Aer Lingus plane – about to land on Runway 28, where FR-227 was now taxiing the wrong way – aborted its landing and flew around the airport to come in for another approach. While Aer Lingus flight EI-249 had not been cleared to land, the flight was less than a minute from touchdown when the crew was forced to abort. The controller also advised the crew of the next inbound flight, Aer Lingus EI-627 from Copenhagen: ‘Possible go-around now, traffic has made a 180 on the runway.’ Ryanair 227 then called the tower to advise it they were turning off at taxiway Echo 7. The tower controller told the pilot: ‘No, you can’t make that turn. You’ve got to all the way down the runway to Echo 5. This meant that the Ryanair jet had to travel almost halfway back down the 2.6km runway. No other aircraft could land or take off until the aircraft had cleared the runway. Soon afterwards, the controller confirmed to flight EI-627 that it too would have to abort its landing and go around. The tower next made several attempts at finding out from Ryanair 227 exactly why it had made the unauthorised 180-degree turn rather than continue to the end of the runway and exit at Bravo 7. Statement: A Ryanair spokesman confirmed the company was aware of the incident and is co-operating with the investigation . The crew explained they’d had issues with the landing and had had to brake hard. An airport rescue vehicle carried out an inspection for rubber or debris left on the runway after the hard braking and to see whether any runway lights had been broken. Several other incoming Ryanair and Aer Lingus flights were told to break off their approaches and enter holding patterns over the Irish Sea for several minutes until this had been completed. The runway was quickly inspected and cleared to allow landings to recommence. While the runway was effectively closed for less than 15 minutes, a total of eight flights were affected.It’s likely that the incident cost both Ryanair and Aer Lingus thousands of euro in extra fuel. Hundreds of passengers were delayed. Ryanair came under fire late last year after three of its planes made emergency landings in Valencia, Spain, in just one day. The criticism prompted outspoken boss Michael O’Leary to defend the budget airline, claiming its safety record over its 28-year history was ‘impeccable’.

And now it seems Star Trek obsessives are about to go one step further than ever before after a call to arms from their heroes. The northern Californian scientific research organisation, the SETI Institute, has been asking members of the public to come up with new names for two of Pluto's moons. Call to arms:  Leonard Nimoy, left, and William Shatner, right, have been urging fans of Star Trek to vote Vulcan as the new name of one of Pluto's moons . The names will then be passed to the International Astronomical Union which will make the final call. And its looking increasingly likely that one of the names will be Vulcan - which is known to Star Trek fans as the home planet of Spock - the loyal member of the Starship Enterprise. Star Trek fans have been urged to vote for the new name by none other than Captain Kirk and Mr Spock. Leonard Nimoy - who played Spock - said it was 'logical' that one of the moons should be named Vulcan. But his former captain, Kirk, played by William Shatner - even urged Trekkies to write to the SETI Institute to recommend the name. Appeal: Members of the public have been asked to come up with new names for two of Pluto's moons. The planet is pictured . Stars: William Shatner as Admiral Kirk and Leonard Nimoy as Spock are seen in the 1991 film Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country . Writing on his Facebook page earlier this month, Mr Shatner showed his delight that the name was added as an option. He said: 'It apparently made a difference as they now have added it as an official name. 'Isn’t that wonderful.' Following the public appeals by two of the show's iconic stars, the name was added as one of the 21 options. And it quickly rocketed to the top of the tally. By Friday afternoon, it had about 140,000 votes, which was way ahead of its next two closest alternatives called Cerberus and Styx which both had about 80,000 votes each. The voting finished at noon today. The International Astronomical Union will make the final call. The SETI Institute will propose the top two names from the list. The two moons which will be named are currently known as P4 and P5. The two orbiting spheres were only discovered in 2011 and 2012 following images from the Hubble Space Telescope.","Public have been asked for new names for two of Pluto's moons .

Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman, whose fortune is estimated at more than $1 billion, has been on the run since 2001 when he escaped from a Mexican prison in a laundry truck . Officials now say there is no evidence the world's most powerful drug baron Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman was killed in a February 21 shootout in the Guatemalan jungle. Earlier reports claimed 'El Chapo' died in a hail of bullets February 21 in a jungle shootout with a rival gang near the Mexican border. Last week, villagers in the Peten province near the border with Mexico, claimed they spotted a blood-soaked body that resembled the fugitive Sinaloa cartel leader slumped in a car after after a clash between two heavily-armed drugs gangs. Guatemalan Interior Minister Mauricio Lopez Bonilla now calls the reports a misunderstanding. After police and soldiers assessed the area of the shootout, no evidence the kingpin was even there was found. He called the confusion a result of mistaken eyewitness accounts and apologized for the earlier reports. 'I apologize if where was a misunderstanding. It was a mix-up,' Bonilla told Guatemalan radio station Emisores Unidos. 'We were referring to information generated from the area that there was possibly a crime scene with a dead person resembling El Chapo.' 'As of now, we have no verification,' he said. Misunderstanding? Villagers in the Peten province of Guatemala near the border with Mexico claimed they found a body resembling El Chapo but officials have now called it all a 'misunderstanding' Public Enemy Number One: Chicago's crime commission this month officially recognized him as the city's Public Enemy Number One, a year after the US Treasury Department named the kingpin as the 'world's most influential drugs trafficker' before . He is the top dog in Mexico's bloody drug war, presiding over a $1 billion drug empire and accused of firing the first shot in a bloody cartel war that has so far killed 38,000 people. And in 2011, aside from a personal fortune to rival Bill Gates and Warren . Buffet, Joaquin Guzman Loera was officially named as the . world's most wanted man. Guzman has been the subject of a vast manhunt for the last ten years after he escaped from a Mexican high security prison in a complex break out that reportedly cost him £2.5million. Since then the drug lord known as 'El Chapo' - meaning 'Shorty' - because of his 5ft 2in height has eluded capture, protected by his vast Sinaloa drug cartel and no doubt a legion of corrupt officials paid from his vast wealth. He has attained almost mythical status in Mexico vast drugs operation that runs shipments of tons at a time from Columbia into Mexico and on to the United States. He is accused of starting Mexico's cartel wars when his hitmen . assassinated the leader of the Juarez cartel and his wife in 2004 in a . bid to take control of the city of Cidudad Juarez, breaking the pact of . non-aggression that had previously existed. As tit for tat . fighting escalated, government troops were sent into drug strongholds in . 2006 marking the start of a conflict that has so far claimed . 38,000 lives. Now . El Chapo is said to have infiltrated the highest level of Mexico's . government as President Felipe Calderon fights to keep control of his . country amid claims that such drug lords are . really the ones in charge. Government spokesman Francisco Cuevas . first told Guatevision Television that two drug gangs had clashed in . Peten, an area that has seen an increase in drug violence and that at . least two men had died in the shootout. Later, Cuevas told Mexico's Televisa . network that authorities hadn't yet found a body or the scene where . reports said a shootout took place. He never said what led officials to think that one of the dead men might be Guzman. But Interior Department spokeswoman . Carla Herrera told The Associated Press that one of the victims . physically resembled the drug lord. She said officials had asked the . Mexican government to send Guzman's fingerprints to compare them to the . man found inside a vehicle and to send investigators. Even then, Bonilla told the AP that it was residents of the town of San Francisco who had told officials of a gun battle and reported that one of the people killed looked like Guzman. Peten province is an isolated area of jungle and ranches where 27 ranch workers were massacred in 2011 by the Zetas drug gang, a top rival for Guzman's Sinaloa drug cartel. Guzman, who has been in hiding since escaping from a Mexican prison in a laundry cart in 2001, is one of the world's most dangerous and most wanted fugitives. El Chapo's, fortune is estimated at more than $1 billion, and he's been on the run since 2001 when he escaped from a Mexican . prison in a laundry truck. There has been a $7million bounty on his head ever since. Last year, the US Treasury Department . named the kingpin as the 'world's most influential drugs trafficker' before . Chicago's crime commission this month officially recognized him as the city's . Public Enemy Number One - the first time the infamous soubriquet has . been rolled out since Al Capone in the 1920s. Authorities say his Sinaloa cartel . has recently been expanding his drug business abroad, building . international operations in Central and South America and the Pacific. And earlier this month, Guzman formally received the title of Chicago's Public Enemy No. in both the Chicago Crime Commission and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's first use since Prohibition. The . Public Enemy No. 1 label was created for mobster Al Capone. But the DEA . said Sinaloa cartel leader Guzman is more menacing than the Chicago . gangster was.","Joaquin Guzman named 'world's most powerful drug lord' by US Treasury now still on the lam .

A world-renowned art historian and former . head of education at the V&A museum died in squalor after a secret . battle with depression, an inquest heard today. Ronald Parkinson, 67, lived a hermit-like existence from the living room of his home in Tooting, south west London, surrounded by empty takeaway wrappers and piles of dirty clothes. Mr Parkinson was found dead, lying face down on the floor naked with some food, which had been left for him five days earlier, completely untouched. Ronald Parkinson, a world-renowned art historian and former head of education at the V&A museum, pictured, died in squalor after a secret battle with depression, an inquest has heard . Westminster Coroner's Court heard Parkinson, a noted author on the works of artist John Constable, drank heavily for more than 30 years and battled depression. 'He had a history of depression and alcoholism', said assistant deputy coroner Jean Harkin. 'He was referred to the community mental health team, but unfortunately the patient did not engage with this service.' Mr Parkinson's cousin, Colin Barrett, the last person to see him alive, said the depression was not known to the academic's friends and former colleagues. 'The doctor's report said he had depression, but this is a complete mystery to those of us in his family, he was the last person to be the suffering from that kind of ailment', he said. 'He was a renowned happy individual, he had happiness around him all the time and it rubbed off on other people. 'That's why he was greatly loved by his colleagues and friends, and those who knew him.' Mr Parkinson starting drinking heavily in the 1990s, the inquest heard. As a result he was transferred from his role in the education department at the V&A museum to a different role where a close friend could monitor his progress. 'The situation prevailed until 1998 when the civil service gave him early retirement', said coroner's officer Deborah Plant. 'In retirement, his drinking continued, and although his cousin kept in touch regularly, he gradually was not able to come to visit or receive visitors.' Mr Parkinson's long-term partner died in March last year, and his declining health and heavy drinking continued unabated. 'We didn't feel the condition deteriorated sharply after the death of his partner, it was an ongoing process of heavy drinking which had been going on for 30 years', said Mr Barrett. In June last year, Mr Barrett was called to Mr Parkinson's home and was shocked by his appearance and the state of the home. Westminster Coroner's Court, pictured, heard Parkinson drank heavily for more than 30 years and battled depression . 'He had lank hair which was matted and unwashed', said Ms Plant. 'His clothing was dirty, he was seriously underweight, and the flat was in disarray and appeared close to infestation.' Mr Barrett, who had previously kept in touch by phone with Mr Parkinson, began to visit frequently to ensure he was looking after himself, but the academic was in an increasingly frail state. 'On one occasion, he had fallen down the stairs and was found unconscious lying wedged in the door way', said Ms Plant. 'His hands were permanently shaking and he was fragile, he could have fallen down the stairs at any time.' Mr Parkinson was put on an alcohol dependency treatment course, but told workers in September last year he did not want any help. But when Mr Barrett returned from holiday and went to visit, on November 15, he found Mr Parkinson gasping for water after days of not drinking anything at all. 'I found him in a worse condition than before, the room was in more than a shambles, there was dirt, squalor and litter everywhere', he said. 'It appeared he had been living solely in this room. 'I don't believe he had been able to get out to order alcohol, and may not have been drinking for ten days.' -  Mr Parkinson's cousin . Mr Barrett said his cousin gulped down a glass of water 'like he had been in the desert for days', left him with fresh food, and reported his concerns to Mr Parkinson's GP. But before community health workers could visit Mr Parkinson, Mr Barrett found his cousin dead on November 20 last year, barricaded into his living room with cushions and cardboard boxes. No alcohol was in his system when he died, and Mr Barrett said it was a 'miracle' that doctors found no evidence of liver damage from his drinking. Mr Parkinson studied art history at Clare College, Cambridge, before becoming a widely respected art author and seminal expert on Constable. He joined the V&A in 1972, holding various roles in the education department and latterly in art conservation, and also had a four-year stint as an assistant keeper at the Tate Gallery's British collection in the mid-70s. Mr Barrett described his cousin as a modest man who did not like to talk about his own achievements. 'He was always interested in you, and we didn't know about the extent of his publications until after his death', he said. 'His flat was filled with something in the order of 1,500 art books, ranging right across the art history spectrum. It was his passion right until he died.' Ms Harkin recorded a verdict of death by natural causes after hearing Mr Parkinson, of Tooting, had suffered from coronary artery disease.","Ronald Parkinson, 67, lived a hermit-like existence from living room .

A convicted murderer is sprung from prison in an audacious daylight pick-up by a hijacked helicopter. But Russian Alexei Shestakov's bid for freedom ended like an Ealing Comedy when he switched to a taxi. The 35-year-old – halfway through a 24-year term for murder and theft - was hoisted out of the maximum security penal colony by a rope ladder from under the guards' noses. Daring: Guards tried firing at the hovering helicopter as Alexei Shestakov scrambles up the danging rope ladder . His accomplices, a man and a woman, commandeered at gunpoint the Mi-2 helicopter and forced the pilot to fly to the jail, in the village of Sheksna,  in Vologda region, 300 miles north of Moscow, and hover while their friend clambered aboard. Guards fired a number of rounds at the . helicopter as it flew away, but without managing to get a crippling shot . on target, according to witnesses. The aircraft, which had been booked for a ‘business delegation’,  was later found abandoned by a road on the edge of Vologda. The pilot was discovered bound and gagged, several miles away. But then Shestakov's luck ran out. The hapless convict switched to a taxi which police say they ambushed not long after the daring jail-break, and only a short distance from the town on Thursday. Dangerous: Convicted killer Alexei Shestakov was 12 years in to a 24-year jail term in a tough high-security penal colony in the town of Sheksna, 300-miles north of Moscow . His two accomplices are still on the run. There have been several successful chopper escapes in Europe in recent years including an incident in Greece in 2009. Greek police were left scouring the country for two convicts who orchestrated a brazen helicopter prison break for the second time in three years. Vassilis Paleokostas, a bank robber who is among Greece's most notorious convicts, and Alket Rizaj, 34, were picked up by a helicopter that flew over the courtyard of Athens' Korydallos prison in February 2009. The two had escaped the exact same way from the same prison in June 2006, and had been due to appear in court Monday in connection with that escape. Three men were also freed from a Belgium jail, in 2009, in similar style. The convicted armed robbers including one of the most violent men in Europe, escaped when a hijacked helicopter flew into a jail near Bruges. It hoisted repeated offenders Ashraf Sekkaki, Mohammed Johry and Abdel Had Kahjary Mulloul. Despite their notorious reputations they were not being held in the prison’s high security compound, which is surrounded by netting to confound airborne escape attempts. Instead the chopper swooped over watch towers and high fencing before coming down in the prison yard. Armed guards were so astonished that not a shot was fired, or anything done to stop the men jumping aboard.","Pilot forced at gunpoint to hover over maximum security jail while convicted killer, 35, climbs aboard .

A father of four young children called police to say he had killed his wife and was going to take his own life - and when authorities arrived, they found both parents dead. David Scott Donaldson, 37, apparently shot his wife, Shaniel Kaye Donaldson, 32, multiple times at their home in Price, Utah early on Sunday morning before turning the gun on himself, police said. Their children, a 13-year-old girl, an 11-year-old boy and twin seven-year-old girls, were also in the house at the time but were not harmed. The children heard a commotion but did not see the killings. Tragic: David Scott Donaldson, left, shot dead his wife Shaniel, right, before taking his own life, police said. Their four children, all pictured, were also in the house at the time but not injured . Price Police Chief Kevin Drolc said that Mr Donaldson had been struggling with depression and deteriorating physical health, while relatives said the couple had been having marital problems. Donaldson called the Price City Police Department just before 3 a.m. on Sunday to raise the alarm, and its officers were joined by personnel from the Carbon County Sheriff's Department, Utah Highway Patrol and . Helper Police at the scene. As officers tried to contact the husband and wife, they spoke with the children over the phone and were able to give them instructions to get them out safely, Police Capt. William Barnes told Fox 13. A SWAT team entered the residence and the couple's bodies were found in the master bedroom. The children are now in the custody of their grandparents and Donaldson's aunt told KSL that 'it's not going to be easy for them'.

It is thought Captain Rob Carnegie was taking part in a gruelling 17-40 mile march in freezing conditions in the Brecon Beacons as part of a selection process for the special forces regiment, when he collapsed and died. The soldier, in this twenties, was given first aid by army personnel but could not be revived and was declared dead at the scene on Saturday. Captain Rob Carnegie collapsed and died during one of the toughest marches in the British Army. He was marching in the Brecon Beacons, pictured after heavy snowfall earlier this month . His devastated family today paid tribute to the soldier, saying: 'He died doing the job he loved as an officer in the British Army.' Capt Carnegie was based at the SAS headquarters in Hereford but was from Dublin and was a member of the Royal Signals. Police are investigating the soldier's death, whose body was found at Corn Du in . the Welsh mountain range. A Dyfed Powys Police spokeswoman confirmed that what is being treated as a 'sudden death' was reported at 9.42pm on Saturday. 'We are devastated by the loss of Rob . who was a loving son, brother and uncle,' his family said in a brief . statement issued by the Ministry of Defence.

The skyscrapers of the future will be 'living' buildings powered by algae that respond automatically to the weather and the changing needs of inhabitants, a new study claims. Research by engineering multinational Arup, the firm behind the Pompidou Centre, the Sydney Opera House and many of the stadia for the 2008 Olympics, has imagined how urban buildings could look by 2050. Predictions include ideas as outlandish as jet-powered maintenance robots, high-rise farms and photovoltaic paint - all of which, incredibly, are already in development. Skyscraper of the future: A new report . claims that by 2050 buildings will have modular designs maintained by . jet-powered drones, a digital 'nervous system' and be entirely fuel . efficient thanks to algae fuel cells . 'In 2050, the urban dweller and the city are in a state of constant flux - changing and evolving in reaction to emerging contexts and conditions,' the report says. 'The urban building of the future fosters this innate quality, essentially functioning as a living organism in its own right - reacting to the local environment and engaging with the users within.' The study by by Arup’s internal thinktank predicts that structures will be fully integrated into the fabric of the city, responsive to changes in the external environment, and designed for continuous adaptability. Responding to estimates that in four decades 75 per cent of an estimated global population of nine billion will be living in cities, it foresees a shift to increasingly dense urban environments. At the same time, it predicts, the rise of networked 'smart' devices will lead cities 'where everything can be manipulated in realtime and where all the components of the urban fabric are part of a single smart system and an internet of things'. Maintenance drones: The modular skyscrapers of . the future could have interchangeable units shifted and lifted into . place by jet-powered drones, according to the report's predictions . The British company that built the Shard has landed a contract to build what will become the world's tallest building - and plans reveal the two look remarkably similar. London-based Mace won the £780million deal to build the Kingdom Tower, pictured right in an artist's impression, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, which will stand more than 3,280ft (1km) high. The Shard is currently western Europe's tallest building at 1,003ft (306m) high. Mace will participate in a joint venture with fellow British firm EC Harris to create the huge building, which has been given a completion date of 2018. The Kingdom Tower, which will have a construction area of more than 5,381,955 square feet, will stand at four times the size of the Shard. It will overlook the Red Sea and is expected to take over from the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, which stands at 2,717ft (828m), as the world's tallest skyscraper. It is not yet known how tall the skyscraper will be as developers keep exact details of the plan a secret. The most incredible prediction in the Arup report claims that the buildings of the future will benefit from brain-like 'intelligent building systems' that enable them to automatically adjust to the needs of inhabitants. Using data about energy consumption, weather, and the whims of residents, they will be able to make 'calculated decisions' about how to best use resources. This could extend as far as using jet-powered maintenance arms to swap the 'modules' that form the building blocks of the skyscraper. Such modular components could be used for residential or commercial units, or even urban food production sites housing animal, fish or vegetable farms, depending on what is needed at the time. 'In this emerging age, with significant developments in construction, prefabricated and modular systems are moved and assembled by robots that work seamlessly together to install, detect, repair and upgrade components of the building system,' the report says. With human population set to mushroom, . the predictions take into account likely increased concern about the . pressure so many souls would put on our planet's already-strained . natural resources. The Arup . report promises buildings that will one day in fact produce more . resources than they consume thanks to external walls coated with . photovoltaic paint, wind turbines and even pods growing bio-fuel . producing algae. Green . spaces would be dispersed throughout the building to encourage urban . biodiversity, while water systems would be optimised for recycling and . reuse and filters would cut down on environmental pollutants, it says. Green architecture: The report's proposals include high-rise urban farms which can respond to urban demand, and algae-filled units which are able to grow bio-fuels to meet the needs of the community . Responsive: The facades, as well as having the potential to generate power from the sun, could also be coated with nano-particle treatments that neutralise airborne pollutants and capture waste carbon dioxide .

Elements . such as vast organic LEDs could even allow for whole surfaces of the . structure to light up at night, creating a new form of street lighting. 'Coupled . with daylight absorbing abilities, the technology realises the . possibility of 'net zero energy' artificial lighting,' the report says. Community integration: Fully linked to the city's transport networks, the urban dwellings of the future will integrate with the rest of the urban space and offer public spaces which encourage exploration, says Arup . Smart systems: Using data about energy consumption, weather, and the whims of residents, the buildings of 2050 wil be able to make 'calculated decisions' about how to best use resources .

The iPhone 5 and the iPhone 4S each outsold the Galaxy SIII in the last quarter of 2012, between them accounting for one in five smartphones sold, new research shows. The figures show Apple's current smartphone models soared ahead of Samsung's flagship mobile to become the first and second biggest sellers toward the end of the year. The surge in popularity of Apple phones appears to refute suggestions that consumers are getting bored of the the Silicon Valley company's products. World's most popular smartphones: The iPhone 5, left, and the iPhone 4S, right, between them took the first and second spot in sales in the final quarter of 2012, selling 27.4million and 17.4million respectively . Shares in Apple have slumped 34 per cent since a September peak and Steve Wozniak, who co-founded the company with Steve Jobs in 1976, yesterday warned the company seemed to be losing its 'cool guy' status. Nevertheless, figures from tech market research firm Strategy Analytics showed Apple sold 27.4million iPhone 5s in Q4 and 17.4million iPhone 4S handsets. That compared to sales of 15.4million for the Samsung Galaxy SIII, a whopping 12million fewer shipped than Apple's top-of-the-range smartphone. Due for an upgrade: Samsung's Galaxy SIII, here brandished by models in South Korea, has been beaten into their place in the smartphone market by Apple's surprise surge in sales, figures from Strategy Analytics show . 'The iPhone 5 captured an impressive 13 percent share of all smartphones shipped globally and it has become the world’s best-selling smartphone model for the first time ever,' said Strategy Analytics. 'A rich touchscreen design, extensive distribution across dozens of countries, and generous operator subsidies have been among the main causes of the iPhone 5’s success. 'In addition to the iPhone 5, Apple shipped an estimated 17.4 million iPhone 4S units for 8 percent smartphone share globally in Q4 2012. 'Apple’s iPhone 5 and iPhone 4S are currently the world’s two most popular smartphone models.' Warning: The positive news for Apple came as co-founder Steve Wozniak warned that Apple was facing tougher competition than ever from mobile phone and tablet computer rivals . With the Galaxy due for an update, it perhaps does not seem surprising that the latest Apple device outsold it, but what did surprise observers was that the older 4S model also outsold the more highly specced Samsung phone. The positive news for Apple came as co-founder Steve Wozniak warned that Apple was facing tougher competition than ever from mobile phone and tablet computer rivals. In an interview with Bloomberg, the 62-year-old, who designed the first Apple computers, said Apple should consider opening up its ecosystem by, for example, allowing buyers of rival mobiles access to iTunes. He warned that as competitors innovated their products, Apple was increasingly being forced to rely on its appeal as a premium brand rather than having features to outclass competing devices. 'We used to have these ads, I’m a Mac and I’m a PC, and the Mac was always the cool guy,' he said.

Millions of British TV viewers could lose their signal as a result of new high speed 4G mobile phone signals. The firm set up to monitor the problem today admitted it was in a race against time to distribute filters to an estimated 2.3 million viewers before the networks go live in the summer. 40,000 homes will lose their signal entirely, and will be forced to use alternatives such as satellite or cable to receive a TV signal. Bad Reception: The introduction of 4G mobile networks could cause problems for over 2 million British TV viewers - with a race against time underway to get them filters in time. With the switch-over of TV services to . digital, a band of frequencies previously used by TV is being made . available for phone firms to offer high speed 4G services. This 800 MHz . band is currently being auctioned by Ofcom to companies that wish to . provide 4G services. In certain circumstances, it is possible that new 4G services at 800 MHz . could interfere with some existing terrestrial digital TV signals, meaning viewers will need to fit a filter or, in around 40,000 cases, use cable or satellite providers. Digital Mobile Spectrum Limited, a new company funded by £180m of the proceeds of the ongoing 4G radio spectrum auction, is in charge of the problem. The auction is expected to finish later this month, allowing mobile operators to begin building the 4G networks by the summer. 'We need to be fully operational by March to be in place to mitigate any interference issues,' said Simon Beresford-Wylie, a telecoms industry veteran today appointed as chief executive of DMSL. 'I look forward to working closely . with broadcasters and mobile network operators to ensure everyone . continues to be able to receive their current TV service.' He told The Telegraph engineers will be able to predict where interference will occur, based on a 'sophisticated model' developed with the mobile operators. 'We expect to be able to identify affected households. 'We will need to procure millions [of filters] in the first instance,' he said. 'We’re focused on being able to . provide anyone who may be affected with the information and equipment . they’ll need to ensure they continue to receive free-to-air TV.' The launch of 4G networks could leave up to 2.3million consumers without TV services - unless they fit a filter . The areas likely to be worst hit identified by Ofcom include those served by the Crystal Palace transmitter in London and the Winter Hill transmitter in Lancashire. However, the firm has not yet revealed detailed information of the affected areas. The services are not the first 4G networks to operate in the UK. However, EE’s 4G network, operating in major cities, does not interfere with television signals because it reuses the 1,800MHz radio spectrum band originally allocated for 2G mobile networks. The 800MHz band, ideal for covering rural areas with 4G, is likely to interfere, however, as digital terrestrial television uses the adjacent 700MHz band. Of the 2.3 million potentially affected homes, regulators have calculated that for almost 40,000 could permanently lose their Freeview signal because a filter will be ineffective. The chairman of DMSL, Andrew Pinder, said, 'Ensuring Britain’s terrestrial TV continues uninterrupted while Britain benefits from 4G at 800 MHz is a huge responsibility.' 200,000 watts of lighting illuminate the 219 metre tall Crystal Palace broadcast tower, as part of Arqiva's ""Switch Over Night"".

The Battle of Bosworth Field may never have happened if Henry Tudor's first attempt to seize the throne from Richard III two years earlier had not been thwarted by the weather, an academic claimed today. The remains of the last Plantagenet king were dug up in a council car park in Leicester last year and following a lengthy investigation were positively identified earlier this month. But Ros Smith, a PhD student at the University of Bristol's School of Geographical Sciences, believes Richard III may not have met his end at Bosworth Field, if it had not been for the storms of October 1483. Battle of Bosworth, 22 August 1485: Experts now believe storms halted a previous attack after the River Severn was flooded . Born . in 1452, Richard III was King of England for two years, from 1483 . until his death in 1485 during the Battle of Bosworth Field. According . to another tale, Richard consulted a seer in Leicester before the . battle who foretold that 'where your spur should strike on the ride into . battle, your head shall be broken on the return'. On . the ride into battle his spur struck the bridge stone of the Bow . Bridge; legend has it that, as his corpse was being carried from the . battle over the back of a horse, his head struck the same stone and was . broken open.Richard III was the last English king to be killed in battle . He was the last king of the House of York and the last of the Plantagenet dynasty. Although Richard III has gone down in history as a monstrous tyrant with a . hunchback and a withered arm, most historians now claim such an . image is purely fictitious and down largely to how he was portrayed by . Shakespeare. Ms Smith was aware of a great storm and flood in the Severn Estuary in 1483 but she did not realise its historical significance until she read Shakespeare's Richard III. Shakespeare's play, and the chronicles that he used to research historical events, document a co-ordinated attempt to confront Richard III in 1483. Two armies set out, one led by the Duke of Buckingham and one by the Earl of Richmond - later to become Henry VII - but both failed to meet with Richard. Shakespeare described how the Duke of Buckingham had amassed an army of Welshmen and aimed to cross the River Severn to confront Richard III at Salisbury but, due to flooding of the river, this became impossible: 'by sudden floods and fall of waters, Buckingham's army is dispers'd and scatter'd'. Ms Smith also noted that the chronicles report that the Earl of Richmond had set sail from Brittany at the same time, with a 5,000 strong army, in an attempt to fight Richard for the crown, but, due to a great storm off the south west coast of England: 'The Bretagne navy [was] dispers'd by tempest'. Nobody had ever made the historical connection between the two events before. Ms Smith said: 'The combination of storm and flooding in the Severn Estuary was a significant event and led to the drowning of more than 200 people. 'Yet it would hardly have been mentioned in the chronicles if it hadn't disrupted the plans of Dukes and Earls.' The world's only facial reconstruction of Richard III was recently unveiled after 528 years after his remains were found in a car park in Leicester. Here, he is face to face with his 17th generation nephew , Michael Ibsen . The Duke of Buckingham lost his head, but in 1485 the Earl of Richmond landed safely in Pembrokeshire and, with his strengthened army defeated Richard III at Bosworth Field, to become Henry VII. Richard was the last English monarch to fall in battle and his death brought to a close the Wars of the Roses. A depiction of the carnage during the Battle of Bosworth Field by 18th century painter Philip James de Loutherbourg (1740-1812) The Battle of Bosworth Field was . fought on the morning of August 22, 1485, and marked the end of the War . Of The  Roses, the 30-year civil war between the houses of York and . Lancaster. One of the . most important clashes in English history, it saw the death of Richard . III, ushered in the Tudor dynasty and gave Shakespeare one of his best . known quotations. The . leading role has been played by Laurence Olivier and Sir Ian McKellen, . and the battle has also been immortalised in many artworks. The battle marked the final . confrontation between the Yorkist king Richard III and his challenger . Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond and leader of the House of Lancaster. The seeds of Richard's downfall were sown when he seized the throne from his 12-year-old nephew Edward V in 1483. Support . for the monarch was further diminished when Edward and his younger . brother disappeared and Richard was involved in the death of his wife. Henry laid claim to the throne from across the Channel. Following . an unsuccessful attempt to invade England from his base in France, . Henry arrived on the coast of Wales on August 1, 1485. Gathering . support as he marched inland, Richard hurriedly mustered troops and . intercepted Henry's army south of Market Bosworth in Leicestershire. After . Richard's death on the battlefield his rival was crowned King Henry VII . and became the first English monarch of the Tudor dynasty, which lasted . until 1603.","University of Bristol researcher believes .

In an interview with website goingveryvegan he said: ‘Luke, Greta and I had the idea to start Naked Vegan Cooking when we all moved in together two years ago. ‘We decided to team up and create a blog to share our recipes. At the time we thought of the idea, Luke happened to be in the kitchen cooking naked and Naked Vegan Cooking was born. ‘We soon realised that by being naked we can talk about some of the issues that we care about – creating positive body image, showing real naked bodies in a world of photoshopped, unrealistic images, and feminism.’ Starkers: Enthusiastic fan of the site John submitted his pie recipe . best friends: The whole gang get involved with a fun group photo .

Despite their strong ethical message, Jess, who was put off meat after watching Babe, said that they do not want to pressure people, and that Veganism is ‘one option among many different options.’ He said: ‘To be honest I cheat a fair bit. I don’t think the odd bit of cheating is a bad thing. ‘I kind of have this impression that a lot of vegans are obsessed with “purity”; scouring ingredients for small traces of animal products that probably don’t make a massive impact on animal suffering.’ He added: ‘Veganism is not the revolution.’ INGREDIENTS:One large onion (finely chopped)2-3 sticks of celery (fine chopped)olive oil2-3 slices of crumbled wholemeal bread2 stock cubes / or 2tsp bullion powder350g mushrooms (sliced), bunch of parsley (fine chopped),1 head of garlic (roughly chopped)1 tbsp marmite/yeast extract, 300gtoasted hazelnutssalt and pepper to taste . 2 slices of wholemeal bread per person . vegan margarine . sesame seedsMETHODGently sweat down the onion, celery and garlic in a largish pot with a generous amount of olive oil.

'We really must have a system where no one with a record of this kind of offence can just vanish. It’s not acceptable and is a serious cause for concern.' A Home Office spokesman said: 'We have some of the toughest measures in the world to manage violent and sexual offenders. 'We are determined to do everything we can to protect the public which is why last year we introduced new measures to strengthen and extend checks on those subject to the Sex Offenders’ Register.

The nurse cleared of involvement in poisoning patients at Stepping Hill Hospital has claimed that staff took painkillers home to use 'in case of emergencies' during their holidays. Rebecca Leighton, 29, spent six weeks in prison in 2011 as police investigated the deaths of men and women whose saline drips had been contaminated with insulin at the hospital in Stockport, Greater Manchester. She was released when prosecutors decided that there was not enough evidence against her. But Miss Leighton was sacked from Stepping Hill for theft after detectives investigating the deaths found packets of painkillers and opiate-based drugs at her home. She admitted taking the medication from the hospital and conceded that her fitness to practice was impaired at a hearing today. During police interviews, she claimed staff regularly took drugs such as the painkiller ibuprofen for their own use, a Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) disciplinary panel was told. Tom Hoskins, for the NMC, said: 'She said that if the police were to search any number of employees from Stepping Hill Hospital, a random person, they would find them also in possession of such tablets. 'The registrant accepts she had removed them and indicated that a lot of other people at the hospital engaged in the same enterprise, talking about an example where a member of staff would go on holiday and would take the drugs with them in case of emergencies.' A total of 22 people suffered hypoglycaemic episodes after saline drips were allegedly sabotaged with insulin between June and July 2011 at Stepping Hill. Eight of those victims - all of whom were being treated on acute care wards for seriously ill patients - died. A second nurse who worked on the same wards, Victorino Chua, was later questioned over three of the deaths and 18 counts of causing grievous bodily harm as well as tampering with medical records. Investigation: Rebecca Leighton was held by police during an investigation into patient poisonings at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport Greater Manchester . Claims: Miss Leighton alleges that staff habitually took home painkillers for use on holidays 'in case of emergencies' Mr Chua was given bail and not charged over any of the poisonings. Chua was held over the deaths of Tracey Arden, 44, Arnold Lancaster, 71, and Derek Weaver, 83. Alleged poisoning victims William Dickson, 82, Linda McDonagh, 60, John Beeley, 73, Beryl Hope, 70, and Mary Cartwright, 89, are believed to have eventually died from natural causes. In the wake of her release, Ms Leighton spoke of her horror at being linked to the poisonings. She said she was 'passionate' about her job and wanted to return to a 'normal life' after charges against her were dropped. Despite her admission, the panel was hearing evidence to decide whether her fitness to practice is impaired.

An undertaker murdered his wife while enjoying an affair with a widow he seduced after arranging her late husband’s funeral, a court heard today. John Taylor, 61, is accused of killing wife Alethea, six months in to the ‘intense’ affair with Alison Dearden, 53. A court today heard he began bombarding the widow with text messages within weeks of Mr Dearden’s death. Couple: John Taylor, left, is accused of killing his wife Alethea, right, while having an affair with another woman . Taylor even left red roses on her . doorstep, a jury heard, and dipped into the marital joint bank account . to buy a ‘love nest’ he planned to share with his mistress. Mrs Dearden told the court she began . sleeping with Taylor in July 2011, eight months after liaising with the . funeral director over her husband David’s funeral. The Taylors had known Mrs Dearden, who . lived in a nearby village, for 12 years, after first meeting at church, . the jury were told. But following Mr Dearden’s death Taylor began . confiding in her about his ‘unhappy’ marriage, she said. Taylor is charged with his wife’s . murder even though no trace of the former teacher has been found since . she was last seen at their home in January last year. The court heard . Mrs Taylor, 63, had discovered the affair, and had written that her . husband had become ‘besotted with a certain little widow’. Mrs Dearden told the court how in June . 2011, Taylor arrived at her home with a card and two bottles of wine . for her birthday, which was the following month. On the day of her actual birthday, she . came home to find ‘some red roses on the doorstep’ of her cottage in . Brimfield, Herefordshire. Home: The couple lived together at this home in Orleton, Herefordshire, near Mr Taylor's mistress . Mrs Dearden added: ‘There was no note . on them, but a few days later John rang me and asked if I had found some . red roses on my doorstep. ‘He asked me to go out for the day with him, and I asked him if he meant with Alethea. He said ‘no, just me’. ‘I think I said ‘John you are married . it is not appropriate for me to go out with you on your own.’ I think I . said to him to come over for coffee and talk to me about it.’ Mrs Dearden said that when Taylor then . came to her home, he ‘started to talk about his marriage to Alethea’, . adding: ‘He just said they had lived ‘like brother and sister’ for five . or six years and he was very unhappy. ‘He told me he could easily fall in love with me.’ She said the couple did eventually go out for the day, and said they ‘just seemed to click’. As their relationship blossomed, they exchanged text messages, some of which were read out at Worcester Crown Court. One, from August, five months before . Mrs Taylor’s disappearance, read: ‘Can’t stop wanting to be with you - I . love you so much.’ Mrs Dearden said: ‘I felt dead when . David died and then John came along and he brought me so much joy. It . was a very intense relationship.’ But as the months wore on, the couple both became ‘frustrated’ by the situation. ‘I found it frustrating that I couldn’t see John when I wanted to and I felt very guilty and uncomfortable,’ she said. ‘He felt guilty about the lies - the . lying at home.’ Mrs Dearden recalled how she had sent a ‘jokey’ text to . Taylor at one point saying she had found them a seaside house and, asked . by Jonas Hankin, prosecuting, if she saw a future with Taylor, she . replied ‘sometimes, yes’. In a text Taylor sent her, he said: ‘I . don’t see how we will last till(sic) Christmas. I can’t last five . months, I am so attracted to you.’ Mr Hankin asked Mrs Dearden what she thought that text meant. She replied: ‘I think John was saying he was willing to leave Alethea by Christmas.’ The jury have been told that Taylor . told the couple’s friends his wife vanished after developing ‘some kind . of dementia’. But the court heard Mrs Taylor’s friends saw nothing in . her behaviour to suggest she was losing her memory, and she had not . confided in them about any such problems. The prosecution said Taylor was ‘keen . to spread around’ the idea his wife was ‘in some way, losing her mind’ to cover up for her disappearance. Taylor, of Orleton, Herefordshire, denies murder. The case continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","John Taylor, 61, started affair with Alison Dearden when her husband died .

After being subjected to homophobic taunts from colleagues and eventually sacked from his job simply for being gay, this animal lover found solace in the sprawling llama sanctuary he set up on his Kentucky estate. But now the future of Kevin McCaffery's farm could be under threat after his law suit against the day care centre that forced him to quit failed - because Kentucky has no law banning anti-gay discrimination in the workplace. Mr McCaffery, who was constantly referred to as 'twinkle toes' by colleagues at the centre in Ashland, is struggling to fund the upkeep of LLA-Nanny Farms - where he cares for rescued cats and dogs, chickens, donkeys and pigs as well as llamas - because of mounting bills and legal costs. 'Twinkle toes': Kevin McCaffery, who runs an animal sanctuary at his Kentucky farm, was forced to quit his job at a day care centre after he was mocked for being gay . Kentucky is one of more than 30 U.S. states where it is not illegal to fire an employee because they are gay, bisexual or transgender. Former teacher Mr McCaffery, who has been out of paying work for more than a year, now fears he won't be able to feed his hundreds of animals for much longer, a report on Buzzfeed.com said. Having already resorted to using cheaper feed for his menagerie - which includes 51 llamas and more than 300 animals in total - the farmer has now said he is 'running out of options'. Mr McCaffery is living on food stamps and his attempts to secure a new job have so far been unsuccessful. 'It's hard to keep my head up anymore,' he said on Facebook. But hope is on the horizon after one woman touched by Mr McCaffery's story set up a fundraising page people can use to donate money to help pay for the animals' food. The LLA-Nanny Farms Food Trough page was set up at the weekend with a target of raising $1,800. Donations have already topped $8,000. Mr McCaffery taught in public schools for 15 years before retiring to focus on his farm. When he decided to return to work a few years ago and took up a post as the director of the day care centre in Ashland, he found himself the target of jibes about his sexuality from co-workers. The centre eventually forced him to resign in spite of his spotless record. Mr McCaffery said a judge agreed he had been treated unfairly, but his attempt to win compensation failed as Kentucky does not have state law in place regarding homophobic discrimination at work. Discrimination: Mr McCaffery was forced to resign from his post as director of a day care centre in Ashland, Kentucky . Activists are calling for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) to protect LGBT individuals in the workplace and prevent people finding themselves in situations like that now faced by Mr McCaffery. The bill was previously introduced in 2011, but is yet to be made law despite widespread popular support. It's sponsors are pushing for a new vote in the Senate and simultaneously lobbying President Obama to take executive action barring discrimination.","Kevin McCaffery was called 'twinkle toes' by co-workers at day care centre .

A man who woke up during the middle of cataract eye surgery has claimed he was the victim of 'torture' after tape was put over his mouth to stop him complaining. Hector Alonso, 69, claims he was forcibly held down and gagged by medical staff after he demanded the surgery be halted. In legal papers filed against his surgeon he claims tape was placed over his mouth and as a result he swallowed one of his teeth. Lawsuit: Hector Alonso claims he was tortured during eye surgery at Tulane University Medical Center, pictured, in Mississippi . Alonso said his treatment was 'torture' and claims the operation was botched leaving him blind in his right eye. He has sued eye surgeon Shehab A. Ebrhim and Tulane University Medical Centre in Mississippi where the operation was carried out. Alonso claims he was admitted to Tulane University Medical Center for a cataract surgery in his right eye but mid-way through the intensive surgery his anesthetic wore off. He said he could see Ebrahim operating on his eye with medical instruments. According to the suit, Alonso begged the surgeon to stop the surgery but he claims the medical personnel put a piece of tape over his mouth and continued the operation with him wide awake. While being 'gagged' and allegedly held down by hospital staff he claims he swallowed one of his teeth, describing his treatment as 'torture.' Surgeon: Alonso has sued eye surgeon Shehab A. Ebrhim, pictured, for medical negligence as well as assault and battery, which he claims took place during cataract eye surgery, like that pictured in the stock photo, left . Alonso is seeking an unspecified amount in damages saying he was the victim of assault and battery as well as medical negligence. He says the defendant failed to properly treat him, failed to take into account the safety of others, didn't use proper procedures, failed to properly supervise employees and failed to properly sedate and monitor him during the operation. Alonso claims the horrific ordeal caused him immeasurable physical pain due as well as mental anguish, annoyance, disability, discomfort and medical expenses. He claims the apparent loss of sight in his right eye caused by the 'botched' surgery has also stopped him from engaging in certain recreational activities and has destroyed his earning capacity. Dr Ebrahim is certified by The American Board of Ophthalmology and is a member of the American Society of Retinal Specialists.

German researchers have revealed a hi-tech glove that lets people simply write in mid air. Dubbed the 'airwriter', the system is able to work out what is being written simply by monitoring the position of the user's hand. The airwriting glove can recognise letters drawn in mid air using sensors. Its inventor claims it could one day even be woven into clothing so people can type anywhere . The system could be combined with Google Glass to let owners of the wearable computer type in mid air - and the project recently won funding from the search giant . Acceleration sensors and gyroscopes are attached to the thin glove, and track the movement of the user's hand. During writing, the airwriting system . decodes the letters by a pattern recognition method. For every letter of . the alphabet, a statistical model of the characteristic signal pattern . is stored - this allows the system to spot letters and build up words easily, and learn a user's writing style over time. Its inventors say it could be used to enter text messages and write emails. 'The airwriting glove is used to write letters into air, as if using an invisible board or pad,' said doctoral student Christoph Amma, who developed the system at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany. She believes the technology could eventually be woven into clothing so it can be used anywhere. 'The interaction is embedded seamlessly in everyday life,' she said. Sensors attached to a glove record hand . movements, then a computer system captures relevant signals and . translates them into text. The sensors are also able to tell when a user is actually writing, rather than simply moving around normally. 'All movements that are not similar to writing, such as cooking, doing laundry, waving to someone, are ignored. 'The system runs in the background without interpreting every movement as computer input,' says Amma. The system can recognise complete sentences written in capital letters and presently has a vocabulary of 8,000 words. 'The system has an error rate of 11 per cent, . but when it is adapted to the individual writing style of the user, the . error rate drops to three per cent,' Christoph Amma says. To . help develop the idea, Amma received the 'Google Faculty Research . Award', worth $81,000, raising hopes it could be used with Google's . Glass wearer. The prototype glove is packed with sensors. However, it is believed future versions could be small enough to be simply woven into clothing . 'When such a system is combined with the . possibility to input commands and texts by gestures, you do not even . need a hand-held device,' she said. Scientists are now working on further refining the method to filter out writing, and making the system smaller. 'This can be achieved with commercial components. An unobtrusive wrist band might be feasible, for example,' says Amma.","Sensors allow the system to track hand movements, and work out what letters are being written .

A 76-year-old Wisconsin woman accused of killing her infant daughter more than a half-century ago will serve 45 days in jail and 10 years' probation, under a plea agreement approved Monday. Ruby Klokow was charged with second-degree murder in the 1957 death of her 6-month-old daughter, Jeaneen, only after her son, James Klokow Jr., came forward in 2008 with horrific stories of childhood abuse. District Attorney Joe De Cecco cited Klokow's advanced age and health as factors in the agreement approved by Sheboygan County District Judge Angela Sutkiewicz. De Cecco said if Klokow had been tried, she might have been acquitted altogether and walked free. A jury could no longer have convicted her of a lesser charge, such as manslaughter, because of the statute of limitations. Bargain: Ruby Klokow, left, leaves court with attorney Kirk Obear on Monday following a hearing in which she pleaded no contest to second-degree murder as part of a plea deal reached with prosecutors . Plea: Klokow's attorney, Kirk Obear, said he thought the case against  was unfair. 'There were witnesses that could have been interviewed that have long since died,' he said . No charges were filed after Jeaneen's . death in 1957. Ruby Klokow told the police that the baby had fallen off . a sofa while she was tending to a crying James. An autopsy found that Jeaneen had suffered two brain hemorrhages, a partially collapsed lung and three scalp bruises. At a preliminary hearing five decades . later, a forensic pathologist who reviewed documents in the case . testified that the severity of the injuries didn't match Klokow's . explanation. According to a criminal complaint, Klokow admitted causing her daughter's death. Klokow had been free pending trial and . will remain free until formal sentencing April 15. After the plea . hearing, she told reporters, 'It's not over until it's over.' Agreement: Ruby Klokow, 76, was charged with second-degree murder in her baby's death in 1957. But she will serve less than seven weeks in jail . Her attorney, Kirk Obear, said he . thought the case against Klokow was unfair. 'There were witnesses that . could have been interviewed that have long since died,' he said. Scott . Klokow, another of Ruby Klokow's children, was found dead in his crib . seven years after Jeaneen died. No charges have been filed in his death. Obear . noted that Jeaneen and Scott were exhumed but that nothing was . discovered at odds with the initial accidental death rulings. DeCecco's . announcement last week of a plea agreement came as a relief to James . Klokow, now 57. He said he had feared his mother 'turning and . questioning (him) on the stand.' In an interview with The Associated Press, he said his mother had regularly beaten and choked him. The . case was delayed several times after Klokow was charged in 2011, . including for mental tests to see if she was competent to stand trial. Klokow . was arrested at her home in February 2011 following a two-year . investigation that uncovered a catalog of abuse suffered by her other . children. In 2009, Klokow's son James went to . police with his long-held suspicion that his mother had killed Jeaneen . at their home in Sheboygan, Wisconsin. He . said the family had suffered years of abuse when their mother had been . drinking and believed his sister's death wasn't accidental. Police reviewed their decades-old reports and searched for hospital and social service records as part of their investigation. Infant grave: Klokow told detectives she grabbed the 6-month-old child and threw her toward the couch. The baby, she said, let out a 'different kind of cry' and her eyes looked strange, according to a criminal complaint . The . body of the newborn was also exhumed and a new examination ordered. Another of her children, Scott, who died in 1964, was also exhumed and . examined for abuse. Two . pathologists who reviewed the autopsy results agreed that Klokow's claim . of a 16-inch fall from a sofa could hardly have caused the girl's . injuries. After Klokow was interviewed by detectives she admitted she had been 'mean' to her daughter and her son Scott. According to a criminal complaint Klokow admitted she was frustrated that both Jeaneen and James  were crying at the same time. She told detectives she grabbed . Jeaneen from her stroller and threw her toward the couch. The baby, she . said, let out a 'different kind of cry' and her eyes looked strange, . according to the complaint. Klokow told police she was struggling to cope with four young children. She told detectives she wished she had never had children and acknowledged being abusive towards them. The . criminal complaint detailed a long list of other abuse against the . children, including allegations that she broke James's arm and nose in . separate incidents, and injured his knees by kicking him with steel-toed . boots on multiple occasions. District Attorney Joe De Cecco cited Klokow's advanced age and health as factors in the agreement reached at Sheboygan County Circuit Court (pictured) The complaint also says she made her . son Bruce stand in a corner with a paper bag on his head at the age of five . or six while she hit each of his toes with a hammer. Prosecutor Joe DeCecco said in 2011: 'We have to recognise it was something that happened in 1957 and it wasn't intentional, although it was reckless. 'She had a lot of kids at a relatively young age, she wasn't happy in her marriage, there was a lot of drinking going on there and she had a temper.'","Ruby Klokow, 76, of Sheboygan, Wisconsin, charged with second-degree murder in the 1957 death of her 6-month-old daughter .

In front of a hair salon and novelties store, they say they saw a man dragging a woman down the street by the hair as she cried and screamed.

The 18-year FDNY veteran told the NY Daily News that's when things got ugly. He said the 28-year-old man pulled a meat cleaver from his waistband and began hacking into his young wife's face and head. 'I would guess maybe six, eight, ten times, he hit the woman in the head,' he said. Bloody scene: The incident occurred in New York's Chinatown, just in front of a novelties store and a hair salon (both pictured) Ortiz continued to approach the man as the attack went on. He said he tried to hold back the man's arm but he continued swinging the cleaver uncontrollably. Fellow firefighter Shane Clarke and Jim Trainor finally came to Ortiz's aid and subdued the madman as the cleaver went flying through the air. It was more of a struggle than Ortiz had originally guessed it would be. ‘He was not a big guy, only about 5-foot-5, but the cleaver made him a little taller,’ Ortiz said. Panicked: The bloodied victim fled the scene but was eventually found and taken to Bellevue Hospital where she is expected to recover . The firefighters saw a nearby police squad car, which they flagged down and the man was arrested. Meanwhile, the woman fled from the scene panic-stricken and bleeding. ‘She bolts. Shane follows her, because I told him, “You’ve got to follow the lady, because she’s hurt,”’ Ortiz said. Clarke was able to catch up to the panicked woman at a nearby restaurant. She was taken to Bellevue Hospital where doctors say her face, back, and hip lacerations are not life-threatening. Accustomed to terrifying and dire situations, these FDNY heroes feel fortunate to have come to the rescue so quickly but were definitely fazed by this unusual occurrence. ‘Besides the World Trade Center,’ Clarke said, ‘this was the craziest thing I’ve ever seen.’ The attacker was taken into custody at the scene, where remains.","Firefighters subdued the crazed man as the bloodied victim fled the scene panic-stricken .

A failed romance won't just cost you time, tears and heart ache, millions of Brits are finding a relationship breakdown can also bring the additional stress of being credit blacklisted as a result of their ex's money troubles. Nearly seven million Britons have seen their credit ratings affected by the poor finances of a partner, including many who have long since split with that person. But unless they have applied for the equivalent of a financial divorce, even responsible adults could find themselves turned down for a loan or credit card because of a former lover. Money woes: Nearly seven million Britons have seen their credit ratings affected by the poor finances of a partner . Analysts Experian CreditExpert estimates up to 6.8 million Britons - around one in seven of the adult population - have suffered money troubles because of a romantic relationship. Almost half of these (47 per cent) have been affected by the problems of an ex-partner and a third (33 per cent) are still affected up to three years after the relationship has ended. The survey of over 3,000 adults also found one in four (25 per cent) ex-lovers struggled to get a loan as a result of a former partner's credit rating and 18 per cent were set a higher interest rate as a result. Problems occur when unmarried couples get joint loans, mortgages, credit cards or bank accounts - which 57 per cent of the couples said they did to prove how committed they were. But if one of the couple gets into financial trouble, even on an individual rather than joint account, the other is listed as being 'financially associated' and so their rating suffers too. Ex still ruining your life? If you don't want a former flame's credit rating to affect yours, you need a 'financial disassociation' This can happen if one of the pair defaults on a loan repayment or does not pay their credit card bill for instance. When couples split, it is possible to file for a 'financial disassociation', a monetary version of a divorce which means the two individuals are no longer classed as a couple to lenders. Yet few individuals tend to do this, said Experian, even though it could repair any damaged credit rating in as little as nine months. Experian managing director Peter Turner said: 'Financial ties, such as a joint mortgage, a joint bank account or a partner's name on a credit card, will be viewed on a credit report as an 'association' to your spouse or partner. 'This association will stay on a credit report - regardless of whether the relationship has ended or not - unless a request to have it removed is made. 'It can be painful to have to think about finances in the middle of a break-up but it can be the first step towards regaining your financial independence.'","Nearly seven million Brits had credit ratings affected by the poor finances of a partner, .

The North Chicago Police Department has been accused of racism after it published an academy brochure apparently peppered with stereotypes of African-Americans - including a picture of comedian Dave Chapelle's junkie alter-ego Tyrone Biggums. The brochure, given to participants in the North Chicago Citizen Police Academy last week, features a smiling African-American man handcuffed in an orange prison jumpsuit, the Chicago Sun Times reported. There is even a page with a picture of Chappelle appearing as the stumbling drug addict he created for his Comedy Central show, with another man portrayed as bug-eyed and slack-jawed in a mug shot.

The brochure includes a picture of a man portrayed as bug-eyed and slack-jawed in a mug shot, and officers as overweight white men . An activist says the brochure raises 'another red flag' on the North Chicago police . Lake County NAACP president Jennifer Witherspoon said the handout reinforces 'every negative stereotype blacks as a people have been fighting against.' Lake County State's Attorney Mike Nerheim calls the handout 'incredibly disturbing.' The brochure's cover features Nerheim opposite Tom Cruise as a military defense attorney from the film 'A Few Good Men.' The brochure also has pictures of television TV cop Barney Fife, Judge Judy and Lindsay Lohan, big-bellied white police officers and acquitted murder defendant Casey Anthony. 'Unprofessional is probably the nicest way to put it,' Nerheim said. 'It was obviously done without my knowledge and consent. I definitely see how it could be offensive to people.

Rockingham said the two academy participants he talked to about the circular were split, with one saying they didn't find it offensive, the other saying it could be taken the wrong way. North Chicago Police Chief James Jackson is calling the handout an ill-considered attempt at humor. 'We should have caught it,' said Jackson. However, local activist Ralph Peterson says the brochure raises 'another red flag' on the North Chicago police. 'It's more bad judgment. For officers to pass out a pamphlet like this screams a need for sensitivity and that this department is not capable of policing the black community,' he said, pointing to a police brutality case that has the department snared in a federal wrongful-death lawsuit. Academy student Paula Carballido, of North Chicago, said an officer explained the images were taken from movies and TV and were not meant to offend. She said the course, which offers an in-depth view of law enforcement procedures, was informative and 'respectful.'

Police failed to investigate a rape by Jean Say who went on to kill his own children by cutting their throats as they lay in bed . Rape victims were pressured into withdrawing their allegations to help police meet crime targets, a damning report revealed yesterday. Detectives from Scotland Yard’s specialist rape unit persuaded the women to say the attacks they endured were ‘consensual sex’. In one case, a detective sergeant pressured a woman to drop a rape claim against retired security guard Jean Say, 63, who then went on to murder his two children in their beds with a carving knife. The shocking treatment was revealed in a report by the Independent Police Complaints Commission into the  Southwark branch of Scotland Yard’s Sapphire unit, which investigates rape and sexual assault. The police watchdog found detectives had adopted an approach of ‘failing to believe’ victims and, in a breach of  the ‘first principle’ of Scotland Yard’s rules, had failed to investigate cases properly. If they could persuade victims to say the attacks were consensual sex, officers could then write the allegations off as ‘no crime’ incidents to reduce the number of unsolved cases on their  books and meet official crime detection targets. Deborah Glass, deputy chairman of the IPCC, said the failings were ‘deeply disturbing’, and accused officers of losing sight of their role. She also warned that the Metropolitan Police’s usual claim of having learnt from earlier failures ‘begins to ring hollow’. She said: ‘The report brings to an end the IPCC’s involvement in this sorry chapter of the Sapphire unit’s history. Rolls Say, 10, (left) and Regina Say, 8, (right) were murdered by their father when they went to stay with him . ‘The approach of failing to believe victims in the first instance was wholly inappropriate. ‘The pressure to meet targets as a . measure of success, rather than focusing on the outcome for the victim, . resulted in the police losing sight of what policing is about – . protecting the public and deterring and detecting crime.’ The IPCC’s report examined the . practices of the Southwark squad between July 2008 and September 2009. It found that the squad was ‘underperforming and overstretched’ during . that period. It also discovered that victims were closely questioned by a . detective constable before talking to a specialist officer. Scotland Yard failed to hold gross misconduct proceedings against three officers accused of failings in the investigation into serial sex offender Kirk Reid, it emerged today. Deborah Glass from the IPCC said it was 'enormously frustrating' that action had not been taken. The IPCC recommended that a superintendent and two inspectors should face gross misconduct proceedings. Ms Glass said: 'They need to demonstrate to the people of London that they are taking this seriously and they are holding officers to account.' She wrote to the Metropolitan Police in June 2010 to complain about 'the unhappy litany of delay and prevarication' in taking action, but received no reply. The superintendent, who is now a Chief Superintendent, was given 'words of advice', through an internal management procedure. The detective chief inspector, who is now a superintendent, was given a written warning, as was the detective inspector, who remains at the same rank. Football coach Reid was found guilty of stalking and preying on 25 women over 12 years in the Balham, Clapham and Tooting areas of south west London. It emerged during his trial that police did not arrest him until four years after he was first named as a suspect and a separate IPCC inquiry was carried out into apparent blunders and failings. This meant they were questioned . repeatedly, going against standard practice which says a victim should . be believed in the first instance until evidence shows otherwise. Ms Glass continued: 'The findings of our investigation . into the rape reported in November 2008 were also deeply disturbing. The . victim was failed by the people from whom she had sought help. 'Since 2009, when the unit came under central command, Sapphire has changed considerably and continues to evolve. 'But given the number of cases where . the MPS's response to victims has failed, either through individual . officers’ criminality or neglect or more systemic problems of training, . priorities and resources, the response that ""lessons have been learned"" begins to ring hollow. 'That is why I asked representatives of those who . actually deal with victims to advise me of their experience of whether . lessons have indeed been learned and I am very grateful to those who . attended a meeting at the IPCC in December 2012 for sharing their . expertise. 'It is encouraging that this . experience has, for the most part, improved considerably, though there . is still more to be done. 'The MPS have recently reconstituted their . external reference group and it is their responsibility to maintain this . vital link – which if properly used will provide them with an early . warning system against potential future problems before they become . headlines. 'The MPS must now ensure that this . improvement is built on and continues – and remain vigilant to ensure . that they do not lose focus on this area as other policing priorities . emerge, or as they face further pressure on resources.' The Met’s Sapphire unit is supposed to set the ‘gold standard’ for rape investigations across the country. But the IPCC report into the latest failings is the ninth investigation into Sapphire and the fifth relating to Southwark. Nineteen officers from across London have been disciplined, including three who have been sacked. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘We . have for some time acknowledged that previous investigation of rape and . serious sexual assault [in the Met] was below standard. ‘The activities identified in this . report came during that era and highlight specific issues within . Southwark which resulted in unacceptable actions by local officers. ‘It is as a result of such failings . that we have made substantial changes to the investigation of rape and . serious sexual assault.’ The Met has previously been criticised for failures over serial sex offender taxi driver John Worboys (left) while Det Con Ryan Coleman-Farrow (right) was jailed for 16 months for failing to investigate rape claims .","Actions of Met Police sex crime unit described as 'wholly inappropriate'

George Osborne faces calls to slash Capital Gains Tax as a report shows past increases have failed to create revenue. Official figures examined by the Adam Smith Institute show putting up the tax in 2010 actually cost the Treasury income. Its report finds people held on to assets – such as property or shares – rather than selling them, to avoid the higher tax rate. Capital Gains increase: Official figures examined by the Adam Smith Institute show that Chancellor George Osborne putting up the tax in 2010 actually cost the Treasury income . Osborne raised CGT from 18 per cent to 28 per cent for most taxpayers in June 2010, nearly three months into the tax year. This unusual timing means the impact of the change can be easily measured. Figures from HM Revenue & Customs show a 76 per cent drop in transactions that attract CGT, and a 64 per cent reduction in tax paid. If the new regime had run for a full year the amount raised by the levy would have plunged from £6.9billion to £2.5billion. ‘Clearly, many people sought to realise . gains before the rate increased, knowing that the Coalition Agreement . committed the Government to a sharp increase in CGT rate,’ the report . says. Reductions: The report fuelled calls by Tory MPs including Adam Afriyie (left) and Brian Binley (right) for the Chancellor to slash taxes in the Budget next month . ‘CGT is effectively a voluntary tax, paid . only when people choose to dispose of assets. If they perceive rates to . be too high, they choose to keep assets. Wales could bring in a lower tax band for the middle classes to attract business. The Treasury is said to support calls for the Welsh Assembly to be able to vary tax rates. Welsh Tories would use the powers to . cut tax for the middle 40 per cent band - but they are unlikely to win . control of the Labour and Plaid Cymru-dominated Assembly. ‘The Adam Smith Institute is urging the Government to slash CGT rates to pre-2010 levels, which would raise more revenue for the Treasury and also stimulate growth.’ While CGT receipts have increased since 2011, the think-tank insists they would be far higher if the rate had stayed the same. The report fuelled calls by Tory MPs including Adam Afriyie and Brian Binley for the Chancellor to slash taxes in the Budget next month. A Treasury spokesman said: ‘In 2010 the Government introduced a higher rate of Capital Gains Tax to reduce the incentives to substitute income for a capital gain to avoid income tax, a practice that was costing other taxpayers up to £1billion a year.’","Adam Smith Institute: Putting up tax in 2010 actually cost Treasury income .

Despite being on police bail, 30-year-old Lee Philip Hammond continued to take money to gamble after defrauding money from different companies in Durham. In total he took £539,343.10, the bulk of which came before a merger. Durham Crown Court heard that he stole £54,000 over 15 months between October 2008 and January 2010 from three investors to the accountancy firm he ran. He then defrauded a further . £411,305.60 from Shildon and Sedgefield Development Agency, an agency . set up to help give free advice and guidance to new businesses. Following a merger, he took a further £73,437.50 from the newly-formed South Durham Enterprise Agency seven months later. Hammond was arrested and questioned on fraud charges but later bailed. Despite being under investigation he then took £1,957.91 from Town and City Management Ltd by creating false invoices. He tried to take a further £3,750 from the same company, but was unsuccessful. Defending . him, Scott Smith said some of the money was made through the sale of . accountancy software packages that did not exist and all the cash went . on gambling. Judge Christopher Prince warned him . that he should expect a prison term saying: 'Go away and put your . affairs in order before you come to court.

They are an essential feature of cars that we often take for granted, so it might come as a surprise that cup holders took more than 30 years to catch on after they were first invented. Although the potentially disastrous effects of spilling scalding hot coffee on to your lap as you hurtle down the motorway at 90mph are obvious to anyone, it wasn't until the Eighties that car makers began to include them as standard. In fact, food blog Bon Appetit reports, designers in the early days of car production worked under the assumption that drivers would actually take a break from their journeys to eat and drink. The site has published a comprehensive history of the cup-holder dating back to the original patent by its inventor, Jack Fazakerley of Los Angeles, filed in February 1950, and earlier. Seems like a good idea: These diagrams are from Jack Fazakerley's original patent for a car cup holder. Filed in 1950, it took the automobile industry more than 30 years to include holders as standard in their products . The early patent drawings are almost unrecognisable from the cup holders found in every modern car . From the days of the Ford Model T, companies marketed after-market accessories to enable American drivers to eat and drink while on the move. The Ford gadget section of Twenties editions of the Sears catalogue had gastronomic accessories as comprehensive as an entire kitchenette which attached to the Model T's running boards, complete with an ice-box, larder and a a door which opened with drop legs to form a convenient table. But it was as drive-ins and drive-thru windows became a mainstay of U.S. cuisine in the Fifties that real demand for cup holders began to pick up, Sam Dean writes for Bon Appetit. He finds the earliest suggestion of a modern-style cup holder in a 1950 newspaper clipping which describes a 'Snack Tray' for a car which hangs from the dashboard, attached by two suction cups. The design includes a tray on which to rest your mid-drive snack, with two cut-out discs hanging from chains to hold a bottle of pop or glass of something else. Perhaps it was that invention that inspired the 1950 Fazakerly patent, which brought the first indication of how the cup holders we know today might look. Pop-out mechanism: This patent filed by Clyde Morgan offers the first precursor to the slide-out cup holders that most cars come equipped with these days . E-readers may be a relatively new phenomenon but historians claim a Spanish teacher first came up with the idea more than 60 years ago. Forward-thinking Ángela Ruiz Robles invented her Mechanical Encyclopedia in 1949 - more than half a century before the advent of Kindles, Kobos and Nooks. Her main goal was to reduce the weight of books in students' school bags, and she firmly believed the gadget would make reading more accessible to all. The device worked with pressurised air, allowing readers to add different spools containing the pre-loaded content. It may be well away from the current format of downloading books from the internet, but in a world without the web it was deemed revolutionary. Ruiz, who was at the time aged 54, applied for a patent. Her rather concise application said: 'It has some coils where you place the books that you want to learn in whatever language. 'By a movement of the same [the coils] it passes over all the topics, making it stop where you would like it to.'It also reportedly had a 'zoom' function where readers could focus in on a particular area of the text. Sadly, the mother-of-three's invention never reached the market as she could not find the right level of funding for her project. Whatever the inspiration, the Fifties . seemed to bring a wave of cup holder innovation, with Fazakerley's . '28504 patent was published just two months before Clyde Morgan of . Dallas filed a patent for a precursor to the modern pop-out cup holder. The . Refreshment Tray for Automobile Instrument Panel, patent number . 2745705, filed in May 1953, included two 'wells to receive beverage . bottles or the like and retain them in an upright position even during . movement of the automobile.' Car manufacturers soon began to . respond to growing demand, but their built-in proto-cup holders were . little more than indentations in the plastic of glove compartment doors. One innovator was Cadillac, Bon Appetit points out, whose Eldorado Brougham shipped from the factory with a magnetised glove compartment door designed to securely hold a set of four metal tumblers. 'Perfect for keeping your cognac stable while you're passing the jitney on the way to the Hamptons,' quips Mr Dean. The Sixties say the emergence of trays that would hook into the window well of car doors, which by the Seventies had become common after-market accessories. It wasn't until 1983, with Chrysler's invention of the minivan, that built-in cup holders began their march to ubiquity. The Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager, were the first to roll from the assembly line with two effective cup holders ready sunk into the dashboard and, over the next few years, rival car makers slowly began to follow suit. But then the need for the cup holder was proven in an infamous lawsuit, Liebeck v. McDonald's Restaurants, known as the hot coffee lawsuit. Said by some to be an example of frivolous litigation, it was brought by 79-year-old Stella Liebeck from Albuquerque, New Mexico, after she was left with third-degree burns when she spilled coffee from a McDonald's drive-thru on herself. Mr Dean writes on Bon Appetit: 'The case became fodder for endless Leno monologues and a national argument about tort reform, but it was also a strong argument for industry-wide adoption of the cup holder - if the car she'd been sitting in, her grandson's Ford Probe, had had even one single cup holder, the whole ordeal might have been avoided.'","First patent for a cup holder was filed in the U.S. in February 1950 .

The wife of a drugs 'Mr Big' who fled Britain after killing a primary school worker in a high-speed road crash was jailed for more than eight years today. Paula Barnes, 45, fled to Holland more than two years ago after being charged with causing death by dangerous driving. Her husband, David, is serving a 12-year jail term for smuggling £25 million of cannabis into the UK from Holland in a lorry loads of flowers. The couple led a lavish lifestyle funded by his smuggling operation of importing thousands of kilos of cannabis. British justice caught up with her in Holland in November last year and she was extradited to the UK where she finally admitted killing Diane Wright, 49. Passing sentence today at Swindon Crown Court, Judge Euan Ambrose said Barnes’s driving placed her case in the most serious category for this type of offending. 'It is clear these offences are so serious that only an immediate custodial sentence can be justified,' he told her. 'This is a long course dangerous driving. You caused other road users to take evasive action. 'You only narrowly avoided two other head-on collisions. There maybe a strong sense of guilt but remorse requires, in my judgment, you to take or behave in accordance with that feeling. 'It is impossible to reconcile your actions in absconding and how that affected Mrs Wright’s family with any real sense of wanting to put things right.' The judge imposed an eight year prison sentence for causing death by dangerous driving and a consecutive five month sentence for failing to surrender. Barnes showed no emotion as she was led away from the dock to begin her sentence. Mrs Wright was killed in the collision in Foxhill, Baydon, near Swindon in September 2010. The mother-of-two, from Royal Wootton . Bassett, worked as a special needs teaching assistant at St Nicholas . CoE Primary School in Baydon and was driving home in her BMW. When Mrs Wright failed to arrive . home, her youngest daughter Lucy, then aged 17, was so worried that she . went to look for her mother. She arrived at the police cordon near the scene of the crash where she was told of the news of her mother's death. Devastated: Mrs Wright with husband David and daughters Tracey and Lucy. The family described their devastation at her death in a statement . The judge said that having read moving statements from Mrs Wright’s husband, her father and her brother and sister, he could not fail to moved by the devastation her death had caused the family. 'They were a close-knit family. Mrs Wright was described in the statements as the lynchpin and the centre of the family,' the judge told Barnes. 'She was close to her parents and siblings and all of those around her have been devastated by her death. The effects for them will be profound and life-long.' Mr Wright is an officer with the Met Police and was married for 23 years and together they had two daughters Tracey and Lucy. The judge said that as Mrs Wright . drove home that day she was driving within the speed limit and sticking . to the rules of the road. 'You, on the other hand, were not. You had been drinking that day. 'You . were still over the limit five hours later that night and at the time . of the incident your blood alcohol level was higher still. 'There . is evidence from other road users of your driving prior to the . accident. There is the evidence from Rebecca Thomas who saw you . approaching her at speed. She estimates the speed you were travelling at . was 100mph. Even allowing for the difficulty in . making an estimate of the exact speed, it was clear you were travelling . far, far too quickly. 'Not only were you speeding, you were travelling on the wrong side of the road, nearly hitting her car.' Barnes had she pleaded guilty   to causing death by dangerous driving and failing to surrender at Swindon Crown Court. Criminal: Her husband, David Barnes, is currently serving a 12-year prison sentence for importing cannabis worth £25m into the UK . Mrs Wright's widower David, a sergeant in the Metropolitan Police, spoke of the devastation his wife's death had caused his family. Flanked by daughters Tracey and Lucy, Mr Wright said: 'We are pleased that Paula Barnes is now starting a prison sentence. 'It is two and a half years since this horrific accident, which changed our lives forever. 'Fleeing to Holland was a coward's way out instead of facing up to what she had done. 'We all thought she would never be found. Getting eight years and five months today will never be enough for what she has done. 'She has destroyed the family and the future together. Today we have a small amount of closure and we can try to move forward. 'I hope Paula Barnes realises what she has done, having totally wrecked our family happiness. 'Because of her stupid, mindless act on September 23, 2010 we are now a family of three. 'Diane was my wife and my best friend. We all loved Diane and we all miss her dearly and life will not be the same without her.' Inspector Steve Cox, head of roads policing at Wiltshire Police, welcomed the sentencing. He said outside court: 'We are pleased with today's sentence as it reflects both the seriousness of these crimes and the anguish that Paula Barnes has put her victim's family through. 'This case has been a long and complex one after Barnes tried to evade justice by fleeing to Holland where she hoped to remain undetected. 'The fact she was caught, arrested, extradited and has now been sentenced is testament to the hard work and dedication of the Wiltshire Police serious collision investigation team. 'Barnes has proved to be a callous and manipulative woman who thought she was above the law. 'We hope that today, Diane's family can feel that justice has finally been served.' David Wright said Paula Barnes had robbed him of the love of his life when she killed his wife Diane. In an emotionally-charged three page victim impact statement he wrote of his loss.'Diane was a fantastic wife, friend, mother and work colleague. There is not a day goes by without us all thinking of her and no words can express just how much we miss her, other than to say that our lives have been utterly devastated and that we miss her terribly.'Diane left for work and never came back. She was on her way home from work to be with her family. [Barnes]  drove straight into my wife and killed her instantly. At the same time she killed the hopes and dreams of so many other people.'I have had take a considerable amount of time off sick and go for counselling as a direct result of this matter. Inside I have been falling apart, so much so that I have had to ask for help.'We were a strong close family until the day Paula Barnes tore this family apart killing Diane. She then compounded matters by prolonging our agony and skipping bail to live abroad. This showed her absolute disdain for us, her failure to accept responsibility and her total lack of remorse.'Our daughter Lucy was unfortunate to come across the incident and was told by police at the scene that her mum was dead. She will have to live with the sight of the mangled wreckage where her mother was killed for the rest of her life. Standing there at side of road with no-one to turn and no shoulder to cry on. It must have been awful.'From the moment I wake up to the moment I go to bed there is a gaping whole in my life. I often wake up in my sleep thinking that she is still alive only to turn over in the realisation that she is no longer with me. I miss her and love her dearly.'Diane and I were looking forward to both retiring and embarking on a cruise or a bit of travelling. None of our dreams or aspirations are now possible due to a stupid, drunken, inconsiderate woman.'I don't think that she will ever learn the extent of what she has done and the affect she has had on so many people - many of whom are in court today.'Paula Barnes killed a wonderful wife and a wonderful mother. I want her to know that, I want her to know that for the rest of her life.'

"By . Kerry Mcdermott . PUBLISHED: . 07:03 EST, 26 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:53 EST, 26 February 2013 . A father accused of starting a house fire that killed six of his children was overheard telling a friend 'it wasn't meant to end like this' on the night of the deadly blaze, a court heard today. Mick Philpott, 56, made the remark at the hospital the siblings were rushed to following the devastating blaze at the house in Allenton, Derby, last year, a trial at Nottingham Crown Court was told. Jurors also heard today how Philpott - who is accused of six charges of manslaughter along with his wife Mairead and family friend Paul Mosley - appeared to 'fake' a faint when he viewed his children's bodies in the mortuary at Royal Derby Hospital. 'Stoned': Mairead Philpott, seen with her husband at a press conference after the fatal fire, had been smoking cannabis on the night the deadly blaze broke out at the family home in Derby, a trial heard . The children died of smoke inhalation as a result of the fire in May last year. Patient Louise Quantick said she heard . Philpott make the comment to a man . outside the hospital's accident and emergency unit around three hours . after the family home went up in flames. Ms Quantick said she had decided to leave the hospital because she became upset at the sight of trollies carrying the young Philpott siblings inside. She described seeing Philpott standing outside the unit with a woman and another man when she went outside to wait for a taxi, adding that she heard the defendant say to the other man: 'It wasn't meant to end like this.' Marie Smith, manager of the mortuary at Royal Derby Hospital, told the court today that Philpott appeared to faint when he came with wife Mairead to view the children for the first time after the fire at their house in Derby in May last year. Ms Smith told jurors: 'It looked very unlikely to me that it was a genuine faint. Because of my experience working in that department, having seen many friends and relatives faint for whatever reason, it didn't appear to me to be genuine.' She said Philpott, who was lying in . the recovery position when she went into the viewing room, apparently . woke up when she mentioned getting a doctor. The manager of the hospital morgue told jurors she heard Philpott refer to his children as 'little s****' on at least two occasions, and witnessed him indulging in 'horseplay' with a police family liaison officer outside the morgue - grabbing him in a playful headlock as staff looked on during another visit. Fatal: Mick Philpott is seen surrounded by the six children who died as a result of the devastating fire last May . Of his use of the phrase 'little s****', Ms Smith said: 'I think that was a term of endearment. It appeared that way.' 'His behaviour seemed to be irrational,' she added. 'It wasn't fitting with what had taken place with the children. He'd be quite angry one minute and then be apologising to everyone the next - it didn't appear to be genuine.' She said during another visit it became 'a circus', with around a dozen people turning up at the mortuary. Prosecutor Richard Latham QC asked her: 'What was happening with Mr Philpott and the family liaison officer?' She replied: 'It appeared there was a lot of horseplay going on - not with the family liaison officer but with Mick. He grabbed the family liaison officer around the neck like in a headlock - there was a lot of horseplay.' Ms Smith told the court that when she offered him some water, Philpott asked if some gin could be put in it. 'I've never in my experience had a relative make that request before,' she told the court. Cross-examining the witness, Mairead Philpott's barrister Shaun Smith QC asked what her behaviour was like during the visits. Ms Smith said: 'She didn't say a great deal and she spent a lot of time in silence or crying. She had her head down a lot.' Accused: Mick Philpott, left, Mairead Philpott, centre, and family friend Paul Mosley, right, all deny six counts of manslaughter at Nottingham Crown Court . Tragedy: Floral tributes and teddy bears lay on the pavement outside the house in Allenton, Derby, after the fatal fire last May . Social worker Nicola Atterbury told the court that on a visit two weeks after the fire she 'had expected devastated parents', but 'neither was upset'. During the meeting, Philpott demanded custody of the five children he had raised with his former mistress Ms Willis, the trial heard. Ms Atterbury’s colleague, Suzanne Eastwood, said he became 'angry, quite threatening' and started 'waving his finger' when told the children would be staying with Ms Willis. Yesterday the court heard Philpott had visited a local drug dealer to buy cannabis that . evening, and his wife was 'stoned' hours before flames engulfed the . house in Derby last May, friends of the couple said. Prosecutors . say Philpott, 56, and his wife, 31, started the fire in an attempt to . frame his former mistress Lisa Willis - who had lived with the couple in . their marital home and had four children by her married lover. When Ms Willis walked out of the . Derby home - taking her four children by Philpott and a fifth from a . previous relationship with her - the pair became locked in a bitter . custody battle. They had been due to attend a hearing at a family court . on the day of the tragedy. Nottingham Crown Court heard Philpott, 56, was 'paranoid' about the outcome of the case. Friend . Adam Taylor, who lived yards from Philpott in Derby, said he had told . him of his fears as the pair went to buy cannabis on the evening of May . 10 2012. 'He was paranoid at not winning,' Mr Taylor said at the trial yesterday. 'He was adamant that he did not want access, like weekends, he wanted full custody.' Mr . Taylor's partner Vicky Ferguson told the court she had discussed the . next day's court hearing with Mairead Philpott after the two men . returned to the Philpott home in Allenton. 'She (Mairead) was stoned,' Ms Ferguson said. 'She said she'd had a smoke. I knew she smoked weed but she didn't smoke it very often.' Ms Ferguson said 'everyone' knew Philpott preferred Ms Willis to his wife. 'Mairead did all the house work,' she said. 'She would make him toast, coffee, roll his roll-up.' After Ms Willis left the cramped home with her five children, Philpott, Mairead, and the six youngsters they had together - Jade Philpott, 10, and her brothers Duwayne, 13, John, nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, six, and Jayden, five - were left behind.The young siblings all died of smoke inhalation as a result of the blaze, which broke out in the early hours of May 11. Ms Ferguson told the court she visited the couple after the deaths of their children and was surprised by their 'normal' behaviour.'It was not the sort of behaviour you would expect from parents who had just lost six children,' she said. She told jurors that Philpott later told friends he was planning to renew his wedding vows with Mairead. 'He said: ""Listen to this, get your suits out, I am asking Mairead to renew our wedding vows"",' she said. Another neighbour, Darren Butler, told the court how he ran from his home to help after the blaze broke out, and spotted Philpott coughing nearby.'He was coughing but it was fake,' Mr Butler said. 'That was not a man coughing from smoke inhalation.' Philpott, Mairead, and family friend Paul Mosley, 46, of Derby, all deny six counts of manslaughter. The trial continues.

According to Fashionista, the actress's impulse decision was prompted when she saw Amanda Seyfried's Alexander McQueen lace gown, which was apparently very similar to the Valentino number she was slated to wear. Wanting to stand out from her Les Miserables co-star, Ms Hathaway reportedly 'freaked out,' requiring her stylist Rachel Zoe to call in several different dresses . just before the show.

'This place is like a miracle. And it is a miraculous thing that took place with us,' Mr Skipton told Yahoo News.

'No one knows why the monarchs travel so far, or come here to find each other. It is inexplicable.' He met Samantha, who happily said yes, on a chance encounter 2000km from his home and said he had butterflies in his stomach when he met her, so it was appropriate that he propose among butterflies that migrate thousands of miles to mate. Every October and November millions of monarchs travel 3200km to central Mexico from Canada and the U.S.and hibernate in fire trees, before emerging in February to find a mate.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 00:13 EST, 28 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:48 EST, 28 February 2013 . New York pushed for the country’s strictest gun control laws following the Connecticut school shooting but they are now going back and making exceptions to allow the profitable movie industry to still film gun battles on the streets of Manhattan. Movie and TV productions have long been courted by New York and other states with tax breaks in exchange for the jobs and glamour of the industry. 'We spend a lot of money in the state bringing movie production here, post-production here, so obviously we would want to facilitate that,' said Governor Andrew Cuomo, who wants to expand the film and TV tax credit. Focusing on the issues: Governor Andrew Cuomo helped pass strict gun control laws for the state following the Newtown shooting but now legislators are going back and making some exceptions . He said movies and TV may use fake guns that wouldn't be subject to the new law but the industry wants 'certainty.' The revised law would allow them to use real weapons without real ammunition. 'There's no reason not to make a change like that to give an industry comfort, especially when it's an industry we want to do business in the state,' the governor said. Another motivating factor may be that Hollywood is a major campaign fundraising stop for New York politicians. Film and television producers have spent more than $7billion in New York since the state began offering tax breaks in 2004, the governor's office says. New York has been the stage for recent films including Spider-Man 3, The Nanny Diaries, Sex and the City 2, and The Sorcerer's Apprentice along with many of Woody Allen's films. Movie magic: Politicians want filmmakers to be allowed to film fights with fake guns on the streets of Manhattan since the industry has brought in billions of dollars for the state . Many TV shows including Louie, Law and Order, Smash, Blue Bloods and The Good Wife turn to the city for their backdrop. The Hollywood exemption is just one of the revisions planned for the state law that was passed in January before the Obama administration and other states offered their legislative responses to the December 14 rampage in Newtown, Connecticut that left 26 people dead. Other changes to the New York law would allow police officers to keep their high-capacity handguns and take a loaded gun on school grounds without permission from school officials. However, the need for a 'cleanup' bill also means the fight over the law may not be over after all. An estimated 10,000 opponents of the new law are expected to descend on Albany on Thursday to try to persuade lawmakers to take advantage of an unexpected second shot at the law critics claim is unconstitutional. The law was passed in a flurry of closed-door negotiations, without public hearings or a three-day review required of bills under the state constitution. Supporters: New York City's mayor Michael Bloomberg has been a major proponent of strict gun control laws . The measure was debated, passed and signed within hours, just days before President Barack Obama proposed his measures including tougher gun control. 'Had they not rushed this bill through, this bill would never have become law,' said Assembly Republican leader Brian Kolb. National plan: Bloomberg had a meeting with Vice President Joe Biden at the White House on the issue of gun control on Wednesday . 'This opposition would have been mobilized ... this bill would do nothing to prevent the tragedies.' Most opponents have rallied around a call for repeal of the law, which would be impossible to pass through the Assembly led by New York City Democrats who have long championed gun control measures. But the cleanup bill provides an opportunity for lawmakers to submit more substantive changes. Others are considering a strategy of blocking the bill from passage, which could bolster the chances of a pending lawsuit that seeks to overturn the law. The law bans a broader array of military-style weapons, restricts ammunition magazines to seven rounds from 10, creates a more comprehensive database of people barred from owning guns, and makes New York the first state to require background checks to buy bullets. Therapists, doctors and other mental health professionals will be required to tell state authorities if a patient threatens to use a gun illegally. Mental health advocates are also seeking amendments to the law they say may interfere with treatment of potentially dangerous people and discourage them from seeking help. Cuomo and Senator Jeffrey Klein, who co-sponsored the gun control legislation, said he and legislators are only discussing technical changes at this time.","New York state passed strict gun control laws after Connecticut school shooting that killed 26 in December .

"By . Leon Watson . PUBLISHED: . 04:58 EST, 24 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:36 EST, 24 February 2013 . The brother of Oscar Pistorius is facing charges over the death of a . woman in a car crash in 2010. Carl Pistorius, who was present in court over the past week to support . Oscar, is charged with culpable homicide over the alleged accidental . death of a female motorcyclist. His lawyer, Kenny Oldwage, who also represents Oscar Pistorius, has confirmed the charges. Carl Pistorius appeared in court just two days before his brother's bail hearing last week. Charged: Carl Pistorius, with sister Aimee, was in court to see . brother Oscar, the Paralympics star known as Blade Runner (below), granted bail after being charged with murdering his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp . In Britain the equivalent charge to culpable homicide is manslaughter. Carl Pistorius' trial is set to begin at the end of March. Mr Oldwage is a highly-respected advocate in South Africa who successfully defended Sizwe Mankazana, who was charged with culpable homicide, reckless and negligent driving, and driving under the influence of alcohol after he lost control of his vehicle, killing Nelson Mandela's 13-year-old great-grandchild Zenani in 2010. It has also emerged that Oscar Pistorius sported a mysterious black eye in a video filmed a month ago for a charity campaign. The Paralympian lent his support to a South African ­campaign for gay and lesbian youth. But charity bosses were surprised when he turned up for filming with a black eye. In the video message recorded to raise awareness for the It Gets Better campaign in South Africa, Oscar instructed young people who were being bullied about their sexuality to 'not retaliate'. An It Gets Better charity source told the Sunday Mirror: 'Oscar turned up on the day of filming with a very angry ­looking black eye. 'Oscar was keen for the filming to still go ahead and didn’t seem to mind too much. Although eyebrows were raised, Oscar wasn’t forthcoming on how he managed to get the injury.' Oscar Pistorius claims he shot his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp dead by accident believing her to be an intruder at his home . Oscar Pistorius, meanwhile, spent Saturday at his uncle's home in an . affluent suburb of Pretoria, the South African capital, after a judge released him on bail on Friday. While on bail, he is expected to take delivery of a £200,000 supercar. He ordered the 204mph 3.8-liter McLaren MP4-12C Spider last month as a treat to reward himself for a successful year, The Sun reported today. Oscar Pistorius has been charged with premeditated murder in the shooting death of . his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day. But the athlete denies murder, saying he killed her accidentally. He . says he opened fire after mistaking Miss Steenkamp for an intruder in . his home. Today, it emerged police have told her family that Pistorius crushed his girlfriend’s skull with a cricket bat before shooting her dead. Details of the post-mortem examination of South African model Steenkamp were withheld from last week’s bail application hearing. But grieving relatives who saw her body before Tuesday’s cremation in Port Elizabeth described horrific injuries from the cricket bat, and entry wounds from 9mm bullets fired by Pistorius. They were also briefed about the model’s death by police and lawyers from the state prosecutor’s office. In a sworn affidavit read to the bail hearing in Pretoria magistrates’ court last week, Pistorius claimed that he used the bat to break down the toilet door after the shooting, saying he had not realised his girlfriend was in  the bathroom. The bloodstained bat, which is currently being examined by a police forensics team, will be key evidence when Pistorius goes on trial for premeditated murder. The ‘Blade Runner’ – who has previously boasted about having a cricket bat, pistol and machine gun at home to defend himself against intruders – claims the bat became blood-spattered at the scene. Last week the prosecution did not mention any details about the bat and the role they believe it played in Reeva’s death, opting not to disclose their case against Pistorius. But to secure bail, Pistorius’s legal team had to detail his defence, which included why he had a blood-spattered cricket bat in his possession on the fatal night. Lawyer Kenny Oldwage is representing both Carl and Oscar Pistorius . Oscar Pistorius' brother Carl and his father Henke at . the end of the third day of the runner's bail hearing . Carl Pistorius tries to avoid the media flurry outside Pretoria Magistrates' Court last week . The athlete claims that during the . night he heard a noise in the bathroom and feared it was an intruder. Pistorius, 26, said he felt ‘vulnerable’ without his prosthetic legs, so . he got a gun from under his bed and fired through the bathroom door, . shouting at the ‘intruder’ to get out of the house and for Reeva to call . the police. At that point Pistorius thought she was still in bed. Pistorius . described his ‘horror and fear’ as he realised Reeva was not in the . bed, and said he used the bat to break down the toilet door to find . Reeva slumped inside the cubicle. He said he called paramedics and then carried Reeva, 29, downstairs, trying to revive her, but she died in his arms. A message purporting to be from 'Blade Runner' Oscar Pistorius to his fans thanking them for their support was a fake, the Olympian's family have said. The athlete, released on bail after being charged with premeditated murder over the Valentine's Day death of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, has not issued any public comments. It was thought that a message on his elder brother Carl's Twitter account was penned by the double amputee, but a spokeswoman later said this was not the case and that the account had been hacked. The message, thanking 'every person that has prayed for both families' and signed by 'Osca' was posted using the @carlpistorius handle. Pistorius family spokeswoman Janine Hills said: 'Carl did not tweet this afternoon, out of respect to Oscar and Reeva. We are busy cancelling all the social media sites for both Oscar's brother and his sister.' As of Saturday evening, Carl Pistorius's Twitter account had been taken down while those belonging to his brother and sister Aimee remained. Yesterday, . Reeva’s father Barry Steenkamp said that the athlete would have to . ‘live with his  conscience’ if he is lying about how he killed her. He told Afrikaans-language newspaper . Beeld: ‘It doesn’t matter how much money he has and how good his team of . lawyers is, he must be able to live with his conscience if he allows . his team of lawyers to lie on his behalf. ‘He will have to live with his . conscience. But if he speaks the truth, I can perhaps someday forgive . him. If it does not happen as he tells it, he must suffer.’ In . another interview, Reeva’s mother June said: ‘Everything  has been . taken away from me in such a terrible way. The only thing that matters . now is the truth.’ Pistorius’s family believe him  to be . innocent, with his father Henke saying he had ‘zero doubt’ that Reeva’s . death was a tragic accident. In an earlier interview, Henke said: ‘When . you are a sportsman, you act even more  on instinct. It’s instinct, things happen and that’s what you do. ‘When you wake up in the middle of the night, and crime is so endemic in South Africa, what do you do if somebody is in the house? Do you think it’s one of your  family? No, of course you don’t.’ In a statement yesterday Pistorius’s family said: ‘Oscar will never be the same ...  having to live with the knowledge he caused the death of the woman he loved, and that he can never undo the immense pain and loss this has caused Reeva’s family and friends.’ Having been released from bail after the gruelling four-day hearing, Pistorius was yesterday spending the day with his family at a secret address in Pretoria provided by his legal team. His uncle Arnold Pistorius said: ‘We are convinced Oscar’s version of what happened that terrible night will prove to be true.’ Today, if his athletics coach Ampie Louw has his way, Pistorius could be back in training at the track at the University of Pretoria. He was last there earlier this month with Reeva, who watched admiringly as he was put through his paces. Friends have spoken of the need for a suicide watch on the sportsman as he spends the next four months preparing for his court appearance on June 4. Meanwhile, South Africa’s top detective Lieutenant General Vinesh Moonoo is taking over the role of chief investigator in the case, after Hilton Botha stepped down from the post. Detective Botha resigned after seven charges of attempted murder against him were reinstated. He and three other officers shot at a minibus of escaping murder suspects in 2009.

Meatballs were also pulled from shelves at IKEA stores in Britain, Portugal, the Netherlands and Belgium. 'We can confirm that the contents of . the meatballs follow the IKEA recipe and contain only beef and pork from . animals raised in the U.S. and Canada,' spokeswoman Mona Liss told NBC News. 'All beef and pork from the U.S. and Canada must comply with USDA guidelines.' A total of 1,675 pounds of the meat balls were stopped from reaching the shelves of IKEA Group, the world’s biggest furniture retailer. Ikea's stores feature restaurants and also sell typical Swedish food, including the so-called Kottbullar meat balls. Ikea estimates it has sold 11.6 billion Swedish meatballs and 1.2 billion hotdogs to its British customers since it opened in the UK in 1987. 'We stopped selling in Italy meatballs from this Swedish producer,' a spokesman said. 'Our meatballs must be made of beef and pork. We . will carry out checks on possible DNA presence (of horsemeat).' More than a dozen nations have detected . horse flesh in processed products such as factory-made burger patties, . lasagnas, meat pies and meat-filled pastas. Last week, the Czechs detected horse meat for the first time, in lasagne Bolognese - made by scandal-plagued frozen food processor Tavola S. A. Comigel and sold at Tesco.

A mother who suffered years of humiliation because of large varicose veins protruding from her vulva has finally regained her confidence after undergoing an operation to have them removed on Embarrassing Bodies. Donna, 36, noticed huge veins on her legs at the age of 13, and when she compared them to her sisters realised she wasn't 'normal'. At 17 she had the leg veins stripped, which worked for a few years, but they eventually reappeared. It was during her second pregnancy four years ago that she discovered the veins emerging from her vulva. Donna noticed huge veins on her legs at the age of 13 and after her second pregnancy discovered them in her vulva, which she finds rather embarrassing . Before and after: Even though Donna is young and fit with a good body, she claims her legs look like those of a 95-year-old woman and the results of her operation are clear to see . Donna says when she's having sex with her husband the veins get in the way and can be painful. She said: 'I never thought I'd be embarrassed in front of my husband but I am because it sticks out between my legs. 'It looks like a clitoris hanging, but it is not. I know that but I don't think my partner realises; I feel a bit like a freak.' Even though Donna is young and fit with a good body, she claims her legs look like those of a 95-year-old woman. She says the veins in her legs and vulva can swell and be very painful, and trousers or long dresses are the only thing she feels comfortable in because she knows her legs are hidden. Donna says she just wants to feel like the 36-year-old that she is and if the veins on her vulva are corrected, she’ll have a pain free sex life with her husband . Even wearing tights isn’t an option as her 'bumpy' legs look even worse, and on holiday she won’t wear bikinis, shorts or skirts as everyone notices her legs. When sunbathing she always covers her legs with a towel. Donna says she just wants is to feel like the 36-year-old she is, and if the veins on her vulva are corrected she’ll have a pain free sex life with her husband. SHe says that if the veins on her legs can be mended she’ll be able to wear what she wants, not feel self-conscious or embarrassed any more, and will be more confident to get on with her life. Donna went to see Consultant Vascular Surgeon, Mr Mark Whiteley at The Whiteley Clinic in Guildford. She had her consultation, a duplex ultrasound scan of both legs, a transvaginal scan with Judy Holdstock (Chief Sonographer) and a second consultation with Mr Whiteley to discuss her scan results. Mr Whiteley confirmed that three out of Donna's four pelvic veins were varicose and referred her to his colleague Mr Tony Lopez. Donna underwent her pelvic vein treatment with Dr Tony Lopez at BMI Mount Alvernia in Guildford and he successfully blocked off Donna’s pelvic veins using coil embolization (inserting platinum coils which irritate the vein wall and causes blood to essentially clot, rendering the vein redundant). Donna then went back to the Whiteley Clinic to have her leg vein treatment with Mr Mark Whiteley. Treatment: Donna underwent her pelvic vein treatment and then had her leg veins burned off . Following the procedures to remove the veins, Donna says she feels much more confident around her husband . Speaking about the results of her treatment she said: 'I am really pleased, my legs are perfect with no lumps. 'Before it was like the vein was filled with blood but now it isn't, it used to look like the back of a crocodile.' She added: 'I feel more confident.

A happy couple have made history on their wedding day by becoming the first people to get married on Southend Pier. Ian Barnes and Emma Hunter tied the knot on Saturday afternoon on the iconic structure in Southend, Essex. The pair decided on the unusual venue when they discovered The Cultural Centre, that opened last summer on the mile-long pier, had obtained a licence to hold marriage ceremonies. Historic newly weds: Emma Hunter and Ian Barnes became the first couple to get married on Southend Pier in the recently opened Cultural Centre . Care assistant Emma, 24, said it was the perfect place for them to exchange their vows. 'We had our first date and kiss on the pier when it was an absolutely lovely day in the summer. It was very, very romantic,' she said. Of her wedding say, she said: 'It's been such a lovely day and it has all come together so well. I can't wait to tell the grandkids that we were the first to get married at the pier.' Romantic: The couple had their first kiss on the iconic structure so it was an apt place for them to tie the knot . Her husband, paratrooper Ian, 22, added: 'When we were looking for places to get married, someone said that we could get married at the pier. I never dreamed we would get it but we did and it's been a brilliant day.' The newlyweds have been together for more . than a year and are now looking forward to moving into their new home . in Southend and going on their honeymoon. The Cultural Centre, a mile off-shore, opened its doors last July, and can accommodate 200 people in its main hall. Happy couple: Emma and paratrooper Ian said they has a perfect day . Pier bosses said that they had received plenty of requests to host marriages on the pier down the years, but never had a venue until now. Lynn Jones, resort services manager at Southend Council, said: 'The pier is attractive because it's a unique venue with wonderful views. Someone said to me that it would be the longest aisle in the world. 'We've had people asking whether they could get married at the pier for years, and now they finally can.' Longest aisle in the world? The pier opened in 1889 is 1.34 miles long . Southend Pier was built in 1830 with the present iron structure first opened in 1889. An extension was then built to accommodate the increased number of visiting steamboats and when this opened in 1898, it became known as the New Pier Head. A 'Pier Railway' was opened in 1890 providing a electric tram to take people along the promenade. Another extension to bring the length to 1.34 miles was opened in 1929. Over the centuries, the pier has survived damage from collisions with boats, adverse weather and numerous fires to remain a popular tourist destination - and now a place to tie the knot.","Ian Barnes and Emma Hunter tied the knot on Saturday on the iconic structure in Southend, Essex .

"By . James Chapman . UPDATED: . 14:07 EST, 1 July 2011 . Iain Duncan Smith will urge British businesses to give young people coming off welfare and back into employment a fair chance . A new generation will be condemned to a life on benefits without tougher measures to stem the flow of migrant workers, Iain Duncan Smith is to warn today. The Work and Pensions Secretary will lift the lid on simmering Cabinet tensions over immigration, telling David Cameron that expensive back-to-work schemes will fail without strict controls on incomers. He will also urge British businesses to give young people coming off welfare and back into employment a fair chance, and ‘not just fall back on labour from abroad’. The former Tory leader’s warning comes as figures reveal that Britain’s population increased by nearly half a million last year, driven by high levels of immigration and rising birth rates. In a speech today, he will highlight statistics suggesting that more than half of new jobs in the past year have been taken by foreigners, and say that Labour’s failure to ensure ‘British jobs for British workers’ risks being repeated. ‘In the short term, controlling immigration is critical, or we will risk losing another generation to dependency and hopelessness,’ he will say. Mr Duncan Smith’s intervention is a highly unusual public warning to the Prime Minister not to give in to Liberal Democrat demands for a softer stance on immigration, an issue that remains close to the top of voters’ concerns. Earlier this month, Mr Cameron complained that the Lib Dems are preventing him from taking stronger action to crack down on immigration and force benefit claimants back to work. Today Mr Duncan Smith, speaking to a centre-Right think tank in Madrid, will attack Labour’s record on immigration and welfare. The last government left five million people on sickness or jobless benefits, many of whom were capable of working but ‘seemed either unable or unwilling to do so’, he will say. The former Tory leader's warning comes as figures reveal that Britain's population increased by nearly half a million last year, driven by high levels of immigration and rising birth rates . Official figures show that over a million have spent the last ten years claiming at least one of the three main out-of-work benefits. As a result, Mr Duncan Smith will say, businesses looked elsewhere for labour, bringing in people from abroad to do jobs that could have been done by Britons. Between 1997 and 2010, more than half of the rise in employment in the UK was accounted for by foreign nationals, while the welfare system was ‘perverted’ so that it rewarded the idle. The Government’s new work programme, which is being run by private firms and voluntary organisations, is designed to force a million jobless into welfare-to-work schemes. Should business be compelled to take on young British workers rather than migrants? But Mr Duncan Smith will admit that the ambitious project is doomed to failure unless immigration is brought under control. ‘Even as our economy starts to pick up again, and jobs are created, there is a real risk that young people in Britain won’t get the chances they deserve because businesses will continue to look elsewhere to fill their posts,’ he will say. While Mr Duncan Smith accepts that Britain’s membership of the EU means free movement of workers from the Continent, he will point out that significant numbers arrive from outside the EU. ‘In the years 1997 to 2010, around half of the rise in employment accounted for by foreign nationals was accounted for by those from outside the EU,’ he will say. David Cameron complained earlier this month that the Lib Dems are preventing him from taking stronger action to crack down on immigration . ‘Of course immigration plays a vital . role in our economy when it fills a clear gap in skills. But good . immigration is managed immigration – it should not be an excuse to . import labour to take up posts which could be filled by people already . in Britain. ‘That’s why we must take tough action on this to tighten the rules on immigration across the major entry routes – work, student visas and family settlement – so that only those who have something clear to offer to the UK are able to come in.’ The Work and Pensions Secretary will welcome the Government’s new annual limit on the number of non-EU workers allowed into the country each year, saying it has finally brought ‘some sanity to a system which has been allowed to run out of control’. But in what will be seen as criticism of the Home Office, he will suggest the focus on prioritising skilled migrants is a ‘red herring’. ‘Actually, a good proportion of foreign nationals in jobs in the UK are in semi or low-skilled occupations,’ Mr Duncan Smith will say. ‘And we know that a significant proportion of those coming into the UK purporting to be high-skilled workers have actually been doing low-skilled jobs once in the UK. ‘We have to ensure that our immigration system works in the interests of Britain. ‘This Government is reforming welfare to make work pay, and to help people back to work, and we are toughening sanctions against those who refuse to take jobs when they are available. ‘If we do not get this right we risk leaving more British citizens out of work, and the group who will be the most affected are young people.’",Duncan Smith exposes Cabinet tension over immigration .

Hark back 150 years and these now-derelict woollen mills would have been noisy, stifling and full of toiling workers on 60-hour weeks. But gone are the days when the huge mills towered above the skyline of West Yorkshire, helping to make the county the wool capital of the world.

Descending: Dalton Mills in Keighley, part of an industry that once towered above the skyline of West Yorkshire, helping to make the county the wool capital of the world . While West Yorkshire's woollen mills were booming in Victorian times, life was not so fun for many of the workers they employed. It was typical in 1849 to work a 12-hour day and 60-hour week, with an hour and half for meals - which remained the case until 1870. One washroom had to serve 34 workers in a single mill, and children employed there were often susceptible to illness. The life expectancy for tradesman was just 25 years - compared to 60 for the upper classes. Wool was a dominant industry in northern England until retailers began to look abroad for lower production costs in the 20th century. They have been explored in pictures . highlighting the architecture of the now-empty spaces that would once . have housed a hive of activity. Nicola . Miller, who was born in Scotland but studied in Bradford, has toured . the area after being drawn to the old mills by their grand architecture. The 42-year-old photographer said: ‘I think they are absolutely stunning and so I explored many of the old buildings in the Bradford area.’ Wool . making became popular across Yorkshire due to the terrain of the . Pennines - unsuitable for growing crops and too coarse for cattle to . graze. But sheep thrived - and the woollen . mills were first powered by water, while great wooden hammers bear the . cloth until the fibres interlocked. Due . to the steep streams around Halifax, they used water methods there much . longer than other neighbouring towns - who quickly adopted steam.

Many of the children employed were 'half-timers' who worked at the mill for half a day and spent the other half at school.

Human rights campaigners are appealing to the Chinese government to spare the life of a battered wife who killed her violent husband after suffering months of appalling abuse at his hands. Li Yan, 41, from Sichuan province in South West China, was tortured by husband Tan Yong who cut off one of her fingers and stubbed . cigarettes out on her face. On another occasion he locked Li outside on the balcony of their apartment for several hours . with little clothing in the freezing Sichuan winter. Plea: Campaigners are appealing to the Chinese government after battered wife Li Yan, 41, was handed a death sentence for killing her violent husband Tan Yong . Desperate Li, who needed hospital treatment after one attack, contacted the authorities on several occasions to seek protection from her husband. The police took pictures of Li’s injuries after one beating, but no action was taken and the violence continued. But in November 2010 she snapped and in a bid to stop the beatings she hit her husband over the head with the butt of an airgun rifle. When she realised he was dead she panicked and attempted to dispose of the body by dismembering it and boiling it. Li Yan was sentenced to death in August 2011 for murder. The Supreme People’s Court in Beijing . approved the  sentence in mid-January and Li is currently being . held at Anyue County Detention Centre. But more than 100 Chinese scholars and legal experts now have signed an open letter calling for her sentence to be commuted on the grounds that her claims against her husband were not properly investigated. The Supreme People's Court in Beijing approved the sentence in . mid-January and Li is currently being held at Anyue County Detention . Centre . Roseann Rife,  Head of Amnesty International East Asia,said: 'Justice is not served by executing Li Yan. 'Amnesty International calls upon the Chinese authorities to commute her death sentence to a term of imprisonment. 'Had the Chinese authorities protected Li, as they are required to under international law, this tragic outcome could have been avoided. 'Li’s claims should have been properly investigated and her husband prosecuted before she resorted to violence herself.' The case in China raises the issue of domestic violence in China where figures show one in four women will endure spousal abuse in their lifetimes. On one occasion Li reportedly telephoned the police after a beating but they hung up telling her they do not get involved with affairs between . married people and hung up. A study by China Women’s University found that of 121 women serving time for attacking or killing abusive partners, 71 were originally sentenced to life in prison or to death and 28 more were sentenced to at least 10 years. Ms Rife added: 'Victims of domestic violence should not have to live in fear and isolation. The Chinese authorities are obliged to prevent violence against women, including by their husbands, and to properly investigate all claims and prosecute those responsible. 'They need to address this issue urgently and provide proper support and protection.'","Li Yan, 41, suffered months of abuse at the hands of her violent husband .

Heather Downing, 30, is due to be sentenced later this month for her part in the crimes . The vehicles  -which were all . top-performance cars from across the UK - were cloned using the details . of similar cars taken from eBay, Piston Heads and Auto Trader websites. Each was given a false registration and sold on to unsuspecting buyers through the same sites. In total, the gang stole six Range . Rover Sport, five Mercedes, seven BMWs, eight Audis, a Porsche 911 . Carerra, two Honda Civics, and a Lexus. The group of seven also took . eight Volkswagens, and a Peugeot 207. Ownership documents were faked, 150 . false identities created and numerous false bank accounts opened by the . gang in an effort to cover their tracks. Highly organised, the members also . made unsuspecting buyers call them on pre-paid mobile phones believing . that they could not be traced should their scheme be uncovered. The convictions follow a complex . investigation launched in 2010 when Waseem, the group’s ringleader, was . put under a covert police surveillance operation after being arrested . near to where a stolen car was found. This was the third occasion he had . been spotted in similar circumstances, rousing the suspicions of . detectives.

As part of their inquiries, police . sent the vehicle’s log book for an enhanced forensic examination which . revealed Masood’s fingerprints on the documents. The net quickly closed and police swooped on the seven one-by-one as the evidence was unearthed. Each offence always followed the same . pattern, co-ordinated and overseen by Waseem. This was later explained . when officers recovered a ‘to-do’ list from members of the gang which . carefully set out each stage of the scam with each member playing a . different role on each occasion. The addresses used on forged . documentation and as the location for viewings included those of . Donnelly and Downing in south Birmingham. In total 39 cars valued between . £15,000 and £40,000 - totalling £780,000 - were stolen. Twenty-four of . the vehicles were recovered by police having been cloned and sold on.

The Duchess of Cambridge is being cared for by an elite medical team led by two top royal doctors. The Queen’s current surgeon-gynaecologist Alan Farthing and his predecessor Marcus Setchell are both at Kate’s bedside – and are both expected to play key roles throughout her pregnancy. Royal births are traditionally overseen by only Her Majesty’s incumbent gynaecologist, but the involvement of both men in this case is a sign of the level of concern for the health of the Duchess and her unborn child. Elite: Royal surgeon-gynaecologist Alan Farthing, left, and his predecessor Marcus Setchell, right, seen leaving London's King Edward VII Hospital, are overseeing the care of the pregnant Duchess of Cambridge . Consultant Mr Farthing, 47, is the former fiance of murdered television presenter Jill Dando and took up his role in the royal household in 2008. This is the first royal pregnancy since his appointment. His predecessor Mr Setchell, 69, has been treating Kate for her severe morning sickness, and the two men are expected to work closely throughout the pregnancy. Mr Setchell was the royal surgeon-gynaecologist for 18 years and cared for Sophie, Countess of Wessex, delivering her two babies, Lady Louise Windsor, now nine, and Viscount Severn, four. The Countess collapsed and was close to death when Lady Louise was born prematurely in 2003, after the placenta ruptured the lining of the womb. Mr Setchell also led the medical care following her ectopic pregnancy in 2001. Concern: Kate, pictured last week at an event in London, has been experiencing acute morning sickness . Relief: Prince William smiled as he left the hospital after visiting his wife yesterday evening, and issued a statement which said Kate was 'continuing to feel better' Grandparents-to-be: Kate's parents Carole (left) and Michael Middleton (right) are thought to have spent time at their daughter's bedside at the King Edward VII Hospital . Devoted: The Duke of Cambridge was photographed on his way into the hospital to pay Kate a second visit yesterday . He also performed the Duchess of Cornwall’s hysterectomy in 2007 at the King Edward VII Hospital, where the Duchess of Cambridge is now being treated. In recognition of his work, the father-of-four was awarded a personal honour by the Queen in 2004 when he was made a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order. Royal doctor: Marcus Setchell cared for Sophie, Countess of Wessex - seen with Kate on Remembrance Sunday - during the births of her son and daughter . When Mr Farthing took over the prestigious role in 2008, he became one of the youngest doctors to treat the royal family. He was reported to have met the Duchess last year after her wedding to Prince William. Mr Farthing qualified as a doctor in 1986. He became a member of  the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in 1991, and a fellow in 2003. Expert: Consultant Mr Farthing, 47, is the former fiance of murdered TV presenter Jill Dando . In 1997, he became a consultant gynaecologist at St Mary’s Hospital and an honorary senior lecturer at Imperial College, London. He is a specialist in gynaecological cancer care and an internationally recognised expert in keyhole surgery. Mr Farthing went on to open his own private Harley Street practice and works as a consultant at two teaching hospitals in London, Queen Charlotte’s in Shepherd’s Bush and St Mary’s in Paddington – where father-to-be the Duke of Cambridge was born in 1982. Prince William and his brother Harry were delivered by Mr Setchell’s predecessor, the late Sir George Pinker, who delivered nine royal babies between 1973 and 1990. Mr Farthing was engaged to Crimewatch presenter Miss Dando when she was murdered in 1999, five months before they were due to marry. The couple met at a dinner party in 1997 and announced their engagement in 1999. Miss Dando was shot dead on  her doorstep in April that year  and her murder remains unsolved. Just two months before her killing, she had spoken of her hopes that she would start a family with Mr Farthing, saying: ‘Maybe it’s old-fashioned, but I think it is important that children growing up can see two people there who love them and love each other.’ In 2001, Barry George was convicted of the killing and sentenced to life imprisonment, but his conviction was overturned on appeal and he was finally acquitted of murder in 2008. Mr Farthing married hospital doctor Janet Stowell, who is 14 years his junior, at a small civil ceremony in 2008 and the couple had a son last year. Security: Police were seen guarding the entrance to the private hospital in central London, where the pregnant Duchess is being cared for by royal doctors and experts . Announcement: Press and photographers gathered outside the London hospital after learning that Kate Middleton had been admitted to be treated for acute morning sickness . Close sisters: It is thought Kate's younger sister Pippa Middleton may be chosen as a godmother .","Queen's current surgeon-gynaecologist Alan Farthing and his predecessor Marcus Setchell are heading up the team caring for the pregnant Duchess .

Greasy burgers, french fries and fried chicken account for more than 10 per cent of the average U.S. adult's daily calorie intake, figures show. A survey of 11,000 adults in the U.S., which is in the grip of an obesity problem, found they get roughly 11 per cent of their calories from fast food on an average day. The figure rises to 15 per cent of calories among adults aged under 39. Scroll down for video . Grab and go: The average American adult gets 11 per cent of their daily calorie intake from fast food . The survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention covered the period from 2007 to 2010 and saw 11,000 adults quizzed about their eating habits. It represents a reduction from a previous survey carried out between 2003 and 2006, which found that fast food made up 13 per cent of American adults' calorie intake on an average day. But Marion Nestle, a nutrition professor from New York University, said the 11 per cent average figure gleaned from the latest survey seemed implausibly low. She said some participants may have deliberately underestimated the amount of burgers and fries they consume given that eating too much fast food is increasingly frowned upon. Frowned upon: The survey looked at adults' eating habits in the U.S., which is battling an obesity problem . It found that young adults consume more fast food than their elders, with those aged between 20 and 39 getting 15 per cent of their daily calorie intake from the likes of McDonalds and KFC, compared with six per cent for those aged 60 and over. The results indicated that the average black adult in the U.S. gets 15 per cent of their intake from fast food, compared to 11 per cent for white and Hispanic adults. Among young adults, those with an annual household income of less than $30,000 got 17 per cent of their calories from fast food, while the figure dropped below 14 per cent for 20 and 30-somethings with a household income above $50,000. Ms Nestle said the disparity was unsurprising given the large numbers of fast food outlets in low-income neighbourhoods. The recommended average daily calorie intake is between 1,800 and 2,200 per day for a moderately active adult woman, and between 2,200 and 2,800 for a moderately active adult man.","Fast food accounts for 11 per cent of average U.S. adults daily calorie intake .

Rishi Gosain, a former tax accountant who had a secret life as a pimp, controlling dozens of prostitutes . A respected accountant who had a second career as a pimp and controlled up to 50 prostitutes was jailed today. Tax accountant Rishi Gosain, 41, also secretly filmed himself having sex with women during 'interviews' for work at his brothels, Liverpool Crown Court heard. The defendant, formerly of Rotherwood Avenue, Stretford, Manchester, was jailed for two and a half years after pleading guilty to controlling prostitution for gain. He also admitted eight counts of voyeurism and was jailed for four months for each offence, to be served concurrently. Two of the girls were later found to have been 16 and 17 years old but the prosecution did not claim that the defendant knew they were under 18, the court was told. Two charges of controlling a child prostitute were ordered to lie on file. David Watson, for the prosecution, described the defendant as a 'controlling' influence who insisted the women have sex with him to 'test her skills' before they were employed. He said: 'It was a feature of the defendant’s way of carrying out business that he would often insist during these interviews that the women would perform sexual acts with him. 'However, many of the sexual acts were videoed on his laptop. This recording took place without the permission and knowledge of the women concerned.' Mr Watson said Gosain operated a number of escort agencies with names including Elvish Escorts, 24/7 Companions, Glamorous Escorts and Liverpool Incall Escorts. But in reality they were fronts for the brothels, including one in Manchester’s City Heights apartment building and another at City Gate West, Liverpool. Once the women were hired, he gave them false names such as Candy and Lolita, Mr Watson said.Mr Watson said: 'The defendant would take a fee, commonly 30 per cent to 35 per cent, which the girls would place in an envelope for him. 'There is evidence that between January 2010 and May 2012 a total of £94,730.67 in cash payments were made into bank accounts controlled by the defendant.' In his police interviews, Gosain said he had as many as 40 or 50 women working for him.He claimed he only had sex with five or 10 of them. Alastair Edie, defending, said in mitigation that Gosain had been a 'respected and highly qualified' tax and management accountant until his arrest in March last year.The defendant, whose wife gave birth to their first child, a son, in December, had since lost his job. Passing sentence, Judge Robert Trevor-Jones said the prostitution business was a 'large scale and substantial concern'. 'Even on your own estimate, you had 40 or 50 escorts engaged in this business,' he told the defendant. 'It is clear from all of this that you had very close involvement and control in the prostitution. 'You also, on a number of occasions, covertly recorded yourself in the course of sexual activities for your own sexual gratification. 'You had, parallel of course to this unlawful enterprise, a professional career which has been terminated given the publicity associated with this prostitution.' David Watson, for the prosecution, told Liverpool Crown Court the defendant was a 'controlling' influence who insisted the women have sex with him to 'test her skills' before they were employed . In addition to the jail sentence, Gosain was ordered to sign the Sex Offenders’ Register and given a Sexual Offences Prevention Order which prevents him from creating or maintaining websites which relate to escort or modelling agencies. The prosecution said it will pursue Gosain under the Proceeds of Crime Act to seize his illegal income. After the hearing, Detective Inspector Chris Sephton of Merseyside Police said: 'Today is the culmination of a 12-month long investigation and the sentencing and on-going restrictions Mr Gosain has received reflects the serious nature of his offences. 'We would not have been able to bring this man to justice, had it not been for the brave witnesses who came forward and reported these offences. 'I hope today’s sentencing would also encourage other victims of such offences to come forward. 'Our message is that no matter what your situation is, we have systems in place, working with partner agencies, to offer support and guidance.'","Rishi Gosain, 41, was jailed for two and a half years after pleading guilty to controlling prostitution for gain .

What could be the site of the largest mass human sacrifice in the bloody history of Mexico's ancient civilisations has been discovered. Archaeologists working at the site near to Mexico City have so far unearthed 150 skulls with just one or two vertaebrae attached - suggesting they were hacked off the victims. Dated to between 600 and 850AD, the skulls were found in an area miles from the nearest large city of the day, and researchers say the discovery could challenge existing notions about the area's ancient culture. An ancient skull found near to Mexico City: Researchers have found what could be the the site of the largest mass human sacrifice in the bloody history of Mexico's ancient civilisations. This skull is from an earlier find . 'It's absolutely remarkable to think about this little nothing on the landscape having potentially evidence of the largest mass human sacrifice in ancient Meso-America,' said Christopher Morehart of Georgia State University. He is co-author a study detailing the findings published this month in the journal Latin American Antiquity. Dr Morehart, an archaeologist at Georgia's anthropology department, and colleagues stumbled across the site while using Google Earth to investigate ancient waterworks surrounding the ancient kingdom of Teotihuacan. That mysterious city, home to the famous Pyramid of the Sun, flourished from 200 to 650AD but, to date, the civilisation that built it remains unknown. It was in the now-drained Lake Xaltocan, which was at the time surrounded by nothing more than rural farmland, that Dr Morehart discovered a site which showed evidence of looting, LiveScience reported. Closer investigation revealed the skulls, as well as a shrine with water-deity statues, incense burners and agricultural pottery like corncob depictions, which researchers said suggested a ritual purpose tied to farming. Dr Morehart told LiveScience that carbon dating of the skulls suggested they were at least 1,100 years old. Most were from men. The find is similar, but much earlier than, the discovery of 50 decapitated skulls and 250 jaw bones beneath Mexico City reported in October last year. Archaeologists excavating the ancient Aztec city of Tenochtitlan, on the site of the modern-day Mexican capital, found the 500-year-old remains around a sacrificial stone in the city's Sacred Precinct . But while the provenance of that burial site was quickly ascertained, there is no clue as to how assembled the Lake Xaltocan cache of skulls. Bloody history: The find is similar, but much earlier than, the discovery of 50 decapitated skulls and 250 jaw bones beneath Mexico City reported in October last year. This picture is from that discovery . The team chose not to release photos of these latest skulls because the sacrificial victims may be historically tied to indigenous people still living in the area. Destiny Crider, an archaeologist with Luther College in Iowa who was not part of the research team said that the findings could lead to a revision of historical accounts of the region. The site is not associated with Teotihuacan or other regional powers, she told LiveScience, and its location is unlike the great pyramids within cities where such sacrifices usually took place. She also suggested that the shrine and the fact that most of the victims were male suggest they were carefully chosen and not simply the result of indiscriminate slaughter of locals. Many researchers believe the kingdom of Teotihuacan fell as a result of a disastrous drought, and there followed a period of warfare as smaller regional powers competed for supremacy. Dr Crider suggested the political instability could have spurred merciless innovation in the region's bloody sacrifice rituals. 'Maybe they needed to intensify their activities because everything was changing,' she told LiveScience. 'When things are uncertain you try new strategies.'","Find could challenge the conventional account of Meso-American history .

A Californian man was arrested after they discovered a dozen military-style machine guns, drugs and a stash of child porn in a raid on the storage unit he lived in. Jack Holsey, 47, from Sacramento, was allegedly found with the weapons on Friday after officers served him a search warrant. He was booked into Sacramento County Main Jail charged with unlawful possession of assault weapons, possession of a controlled substance while armed with a loaded firearm and possession of child pornography. Bail was set at $75,000. Inside they apparently seized a dozen military-style machine guns that Holsey did not have licenses for. Holsey, who has been arrested three times previously, was also allegedly found with methamphetamine for personal use and a stash of child pornography. Sgt Jason Ramos, one of the arresting officers, said: ‘We don’t know for sure if he was just a gun nut and liked to collect these, or if he intended to sell them, that’s still unclear to us. ‘When you factor in the meth use who knows what kind of frame of mind this guy had.’Ramos would not reveal what calibre the guns were, or if they were operational. Holsey had been living in a small storage unit without any windows in the Gold River area of the city. The arrest came after an investigation conducted by the Sheriff’s task force, IMPACT Division based on a tip that suggested Holsey had illegal weapons in his home. Stash: Holsey was living inside of a storage unit when he was presented with a search warrant . Prison: Holsey was taken to Sacramento County Main Jail after illegal firearms were found at his storage unit home . The division was formed in 2012 to tackle gang violence and illegal fire arms in SacramentoSacramento Superior Court records also show that Holsey had been arrested on at least three previous occasions, including a 2003 arrest for possessing an illegal silencer and a 2004 charge for receiving stolen property. He was also charged last October for making criminal threats. He is due to enter a plea on March 6.California has some of the toughest gun laws in the country making it difficult to legally obtain a firearm. He is due to appear in court on Tuesday. Holsey's arrest comes as Barack Obama makes moves to reevaluate America's gun laws. Reevaluation: President Barack Obama spoke about changing gun laws during his annual State of the Union speech. Relatives of those murdered at Sandy Hook were in the audience . Activists: Survivors and family members of victims of gun violence, listen during a news conference at the House Triangle on Capitol Hill in December . Experts are encouraging the president to also debate how easy it is for criminals to get their hands on illegal firearms. While it is currently illegal for felons to purchase a gun, officers across the country argue that it is relatively easy to find one on the black market. North Carolina's Alamance County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Randy Jones told Burlington Times News last week that: 'Guns are available if you’ve got the money.' The national debate on gun crime was reignited after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in December when 20-year-old Adam Lanza killed 20 children and six adults.

Campaigners fear assisted  suicide is being legalised by the back door as record numbers of Britons end their lives at Dignitas  – while their relatives escape investigation for helping them. The Swiss suicide clinic helped 33 people from this country to die last year – the highest ever annual figure – pushing the total during the past decade close to 250. But police passed only a handful of files to prosecutors over the assistance provided by loved ones, and no one was charged. A police worker even accompanied her mother to Switzerland but faced no sanction. Secret: Campaigners fear assisted suicide is being legalised by the back door as record numbers of Britons end their lives at Dignitas, pictured, while their relatives escape investigation for helping them . The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) has recently issued new guidelines to every force in the country about how they should investigate assisted suicides. Although the document is restricted, this newspaper has been shown the section that deals with deaths abroad. It highlights how tough such inquiries can be because of the difficulty in obtaining evidence from foreign authorities. But the situation has prompted claims that the police are failing to uphold the law and protect vulnerable or disabled people, who could be pressurised to commit suicide. Kevin Fitzpatrick, of the campaign group Not Dead Yet, said: ‘The idea is gaining hold that assisting someone to commit suicide is not prosecutable in practice.’ Tory MP Mark Pritchard, who is vice-chairman of the Parliamentary Pro-Life Group, said: ‘I fear assisted suicide is being legalised by the back door. If the will of Parliament is being ignored, there should be an urgent review by the Justice Secretary.’ Alistair Thompson, of the Care Not Killing Alliance, said of the police guidance: ‘It is extremely worrying that police officers are saying they cannot investigate and are advising their members not to investigate deaths abroad.’ Aiding or encouraging a suicide remains illegal in England and Wales under the 1961 Suicide Act and punishable by up to 14 years’ imprisonment. But guidelines published in 2010 by the Director of Public Prosecutions spelled out that relatives would not be charged if they acted out of compassion to help a terminally ill person end their suffering. New figures suggest that move  reassured Britons that they will escape punishment if they help loved ones travel to countries such as Switzerland, where assisted  suicide is permitted. Support: Sir Terry Pratchett, left, is a known supporter of assisted suicide. Tony Nicklinson, right, died a week after losing his legal battle for the right to end his own life . Dignitas, set up in 1998, allows foreigners to use its services, and its own figures show that 248 . Britons have now died there – with 33 deaths last year, up from 22 the . year before. Anyone who wants the organisation’s help must become a . member, pay about £10,000 and see a local doctor before being given a . fatal dose of barbiturates to drink. The . Crown Prosecution Service’s statistics reveal that police passed them . 44 files on assisted suicides and cases of euthanasia – where a doctor . administers the fatal dose – between 2009 and 2011. By October 2012, the total had reached 66, including deaths in England and Wales as well as abroad. Of these, prosecutors chose not to proceed with 45, nine were withdrawn and 12 were still being looked into. In previous years, police arrested some relatives and friends after they helped terminally ill people die at Dignitas. But those who made the trip last year said that they had not been questioned. The new police guidelines say ‘there may be a lack of co-operation or even a legal impediment as to why the relevant foreign authorities cannot provide evidence as to how and why someone has died’. They also point out that ‘in a . substantial majority of cases, the bodies are cremated in the country in . which the suicide took place. If the body is not repatriated to England . and Wales, the death does not come under the jurisdiction of the HM . Coroner’. Chief Constable David Crompton, ACPO spokesman on homicide, said: ‘It requires any UK police force to be able to prove beyond reasonable doubt the circumstances under which the person died, and this can be difficult, particularly if burial or cremation has already taken place. But whenever we receive information or intelligence about such a case, these investigations are pursued.’ A CPS spokesman said: ‘While no prosecutions have been brought since the 2010 guidelines were issued, each case is considered on its own merits. Any inference that the CPS has implemented a blanket policy of not prosecuting for this offence is wrong.’ Meanwhile, former Labour Minister Lord Falconer will later this year table a Private Member’s Bill that would legalise assisted suicide in England and Wales if a patient had less than a year to live. Jo Cartwright, press manager for Dignity In Dying, said: ‘Some people will choose an assisted death even  if they have to travel abroad at great financial and emotional cost to themselves and their loved ones. ‘So a much better alternative would be a safeguarded assisted dying law here in the UK.’","Dignitas suicide clinic helped 33 people from this country to die last year .

Topless protesters targeted Italy's former premier Silvio Berlusconi as he went to vote in the country's election - which could plunge Europe into fresh economic chaos. The three women, thought to be from feminist protest group Femen, burst from a crowd of journalist outside a polling station in Milan and lunged at the controversial politician. But the demonstrators, who had 'Basta Berlusconi', meaning 'Enough of Berlusconi', written on their bodies, were grabbed by police officers and dragged away before they could reach him. Scroll down for video . Protest: A topless protester is led away by police after lunging at former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi . Demonstrators: The three women rushed at the controversial politician as he arrived at a Milan polling station . Italians have gone to the polls in an unpredictable election that looks set to plunge the Eurozone into fresh turmoil. Polling continues tomorrow amid fears the current administration will have to negotiate with either former premier or a stand-up comedian to retain power. The results, which will be affected by heavy snow in northern areas, do not look likely to produce a government strong enough to pull the highly indebted country out of its economic slump. A hung parliament is a distinct possibility, but new elections within months could, many fear, prompt a new dip in confidence in the European Union’s single currency. Market investors are already nervous about any successor to Mario Monti’s technocratic government being willing to continue his austerity programme and implement necessary reform. Activists: The woman are thought to from feminist protest group Femen and burst out of a crowd of journalist . Unsuccessful: The protester were dragged away by police officers and were not able to get the former PM . At the start of the campaign the polls . were predicting a comfortable victory for the centre left led by . ex-Communist now moderate Pier Luigi Bersani and his Democratic PD. party. But after a lacklustre campaign by Bersani, the most recent polls suggest that a brazenly populist campaign (including a virtual bribe of a huge tax refund for all) by the three-time PM Berlusconi has clawed him back into contention. A remarkable come-back from a politician convicted of tax fraud and on trial on a charge of under-age sex with a prostitute. As ever the mogul, 76, has used his major control of the media to blitz TV and newspaper coverage, and today compared Italian judges to the ‘mafia’. Meanwhile the prospect of a huge protest vote against the Monti’s government’s painful austerity measures and a never ending series of corruption scandals has thrown the result wide open. Election: Berlusconi cast his ballot today but the polls will also be open across the country tomorrow . Powerful: The 76-year-old has used his major control of the media to blitz TV and newspaper coverage . 'I'm not confident that the . government that emerges from the election will be able to solve any of . our problems,' said Attilio Bianchetti, a 55-year-old builder in Milan, . who voted for the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement. The . anarchic group led by a stand up comedian turned political activist . Beppe Grillo has been one of the surprise features of the campaign, . packing the piazzas of Italy’s cities with hundreds of thousands of . supporters. Challenger: Leader of the Five Stars Movement, stand-up comedian Beppe Grillo, has been the surprise feature of the election . Grillo, 64, (who also has a criminal conviction, for involuntary manslaughter) advocates a new direct democracy which has the main parties scared. The polls suggest he could come as high as second when the votes are counted. 'He’s the only real new element in a political landscape where we’ve been seeing the same faces for too long,’said Vincenzo Cannizzaro, 48, in the Sicialian capital Palermo. Meanwhile Italians give caretaker PM Monti almost no credit for saving them from the brink of financial ruin 15 months ago. If opinion polls are converted into votes, his policies of tough medicine will have been rejected by the electorate. When the last polls closed two weeks ago Bersani was leading at 35 per cent with with Berlusconi 5 points behind,Grillo on 16 and Monti on around 14. A victory for Berlusconi could be the worst result for the Euro because he has promised to reverse many of the austerity measures brought in by Monti to get interests rates down. But as seems more likely, with Berlusconi’s resurgence and Grillo’s protest vote, the two comic faces of Italian politics could prevent a Bersani-Monti government from being formed, the only government likely to command international confidence. For the third-largest Euro economy to be facing economic meltdown could trigger a renewal of the Eurozone crisis just when the worst seemed to be over. A crisis which would affect a British economy already reeling from the downgrading of its credit rating.","The naked demonstrators lunged at the former PM outside a polling station .

More time: Lawyers for John Hinckley, who tried to kill President Reagan, are trying to allow him to spend more time with his mother at her home in Virginia . The man who shot and wounded President Ronald Reagan has been spending too much time at a psychiatric hospital and should instead spend more time at his mother's Virginia home, his lawyer said Monday. The lawyer for would-be assassin John Hinckley claims that he should be allowed to spend additional time away from the hospital where he has lived since being found insane at the time he shot Reagan in 1981. Hinckley has been gradually given more freedom from Washington's St. Elizabeths Hospital, and at the end of 2005 he was given permission to start making overnight visits to his mother's home in Williamsburg, Virginia. The visits now last 10 days and they are carefully planned, and Hinckley is sometimes trailed by the Secret Service. Attorney Barry Levine argued that . Hinckley, who attended the proceeding, 'has done nothing dangerous at . all for more than two decades' and has earned more time in Virginia. 'Mr. Hinckley has been spending too . much time in the hospital,' Levine said, later adding that keeping him . at the hospital is 'disguised prison.' Lawyers spent two weeks in late 2011 . and early 2012 discussing plans that would expand the length of . Hinckley's visits to Virginia, first to 17 days and then to 24 days. After those visits, which could take a . year to complete, Hinckley could be allowed to live permanently outside . the hospital while making monthly visits to St. Elizabeths. But the . plan hit a snag after hearings. Scroll down for video .

Colleen Kennedy, a government . attorney, criticized the solution and called it a 'patchwork quilt.' She . also raised questions about Hinckley's ability to drive now that he has . a driver's license. 'He could drive anywhere, including to D.C. and see President Obama,' Kennedy said. Insane: A jury found him not-guilty-by-insanity in 1982 when he was just 26 and he was committed to St Elizabeth's Hospital. Hinckley holds a pistol to his head in this self-portrait and obtained from court records in Oct. 1982 .

The government has previously said in . documents filed with the court that Hinckley is 'a man capable of great . violence' and 'not sufficiently well to alleviate the concern that this . violence may be repeated.' Levine has disagreed, saying in court Monday that Hinckley's mental illness has been in remission for two decades. 'No one says that John Hinckley will be a danger to himself or to others in the context of this plan,' Levine said.

Roy Lichtenstein’s nudes frolic on a primary colour beach, as bouncy as the beach balls they hold. The pop artist, the subject of a major retrospective at London’s Tate Modern, based these portraits from the early Nineties on his then muse, Erica Wexler. She was 22 – Lichtenstein was 70 – and admits the pictures remind her of how she once felt. ‘I was full of energy, emotions and drama. Roy loved dramatic women,’ she says. ‘We had a lot of fun together, dancing in his studio.’ But for much of her life Erica, now 43, has felt far from ebullient, having battled the debilitating neurological condition chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), once known as ME (myalgic encephalomyelitis). New energy: Although Erica Wexler thanks psychotherapy for her recovery, she say she could not have done it without husband Andy Partridge . Now living in Bath, she says the illness forced her to postpone a promising career as a singer and scuppered hopes of children. It started when she was 26. She had just signed a recording contract and was in a new relationship with XTC singer Andy Partridge who, at 59, is still her partner. ‘During that year I became ever more fatigued. I tried to push on through it, but it got to a point where my legs wouldn’t support my body. I was clammy and flu-ey all the time. A doctor diagnosed ME and I had to default on the contract. It felt as if my career had imploded and me along with it,’ says Erica. CFS/ME first made the news in the mid-Eighties, when doctors began to report on young patients who had inexplicable flu-like symptoms. Muse: How Roy Lichtenstein saw Erica in his 1994 piece 'Nudes with Beach Ball' when she was 22 . Medics were sceptical as to whether these young professionals were physically ill and it was quickly dubbed ‘yuppie flu’. ‘One common symptom is a feeling of . debilitating tiredness,’ says Professor Leslie Findley, consultant . neurologist at the Queen’s Hospital Romford, Essex, who treats severe . cases. ‘Others experience painful muscles and joints, impaired mobility, . headaches, disordered sleep, gastric disturbances, poor memory and . concentration.’ ‘Outwardly you may look ok, but you’re in a mental fog and your limbs are burning,’ says Erica. The . current thinking is that CFS is a physical and mental illness. In ten . per cent of cases, it’s linked to viral infection, such as glandular . fever, hepatitis or parvovirus. Other triggers include surgery,  an . accident or physical and emotional trauma. Erica . believes her tumultuous upbringing at the hands of her father Norman . was to blame. The Oscar-nominated screenwriter of hit movies Serpico and . Saturday Night Fever was a manic depressive whose psychotic episodes . wreaked havoc on the household. His . exploits are the stuff of movie industry legend. He’d throw furniture . from hotel room windows, terrorise those he was working with and was . once arrested for threatening to assassinate the then-president Richard . Nixon. He repeatedly spent time in mental health institutions, often . sent there by his daughters. ‘Looking . back, I see how my family was dysfunctional,’ Erica says. ‘Things were . falling apart and I felt it was somehow my fault,’ says Erica. Life did not improve when her parents divorced and her mother Francine remarried. ‘They were always fighting. Mom would . subject me to these great onslaughts of rage. I was constantly fearful . of what might happen next. Over time, that can mess up your immune . system, leaving you vulnerable to illness.’ Perhaps unsurprisingly, Erica’s first . significant relationship was with the ‘father figure’ Lichtenstein. ‘I’d . not had a proper father and you might say I found one for a while in . him.’ Lean on me: Erica found cognitive-behavioural therapy a great help and although she still has some episodes of fatigue she has finally been able to find her voice . Erica believes her symptoms had been creeping up on her before she met Partridge in 1996, at a New York party. It was love at first sight. ‘He said, “Why don’t you come and stay with me in England?” So I did. I came, collapsed, and here I am still. ‘Andy was very patient with me. Some weeks I would barely get out of bed. But he lives a quiet life, so we managed.’ After her diagnosis, Erica self-medicated with extra-strength painkillers. ‘I’ve tried acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicines, vitamin and anti-viral drips, allergy diets, oxygen tanks, ozone therapy, spiritual healing, massage therapy, yoga ... when you’re desperate you’ll try anything.’ The NHS recommends a combination of physiotherapy, cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and a treatment known as ‘pacing’, which involves teaching sufferers to know when to stop and rest. The CFS treatment centre at London’s Barts hospital is staffed by psychiatrists, immunological experts, physiotherapists and occupational therapists. There are around 250,000 UK sufferers, and Barts receives 300 new referrals each year. ‘Every case is treated according to their symptoms,’ says Professor Peter White, consultant psychiatrist at Barts CFS treatment centre. ‘If the patient is in pain, we prescribe painkillers. If they have problems sleeping, we look at why. Some might simply need physiotherapy, others a combination of treatments.’ However, specialist services are still patchy. A survey of 2,000 patients found that 74 per cent had suffered from CFS for five years or more, with 49 per cent having been ill for more than ten years. Erica says: ‘Cognitive behavioural therapy helped, because it offers a structure with which to manage your energy. Meditation’s great, too.’ By 2006, her fog had started to lift and she began to record the longed-for album, which will finally be released next month. ‘I still have episodes of fatigue,’ she says. ‘But you can’t get stuck at a point of bitterness and resentment or the rest of your life will be ruined. I try to look on the bright side of the dark side.’ Ercia Wexler’s debut album ‘Sunlit Night’ -  is released March 18th on Folly MusicVisit ericawexler.com .","Erica Wexler, 43, suffers from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome or ME .

Rupert Murdoch apologised for the 'grotesque, offensive cartoon' by Sunday Times cartoonist Gerald Scarfe . Rupert Murdoch and the acting editor . of the Sunday Times have apologised for a ‘grotesque, offensive cartoon’ published in the newspaper, which has been described as anti-Semitic. The cartoon, by Gerald Scarfe, showed . Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu building a wall using what . appeared to be the blood and limbs of Palestinians. Published on Holocaust Memorial Day . and carrying the strapline ‘Israeli elections. Will cementing peace . continue?’, it was condemned by Chief Rabbi Lord Sacks. Yesterday the acting editor of the . Sunday Times apologised for the cartoon at a meeting with . representatives of the Jewish community. Martin Ivens said: ‘You will know . that the Sunday Times abhors anti-Semitism and would never set out to . cause offence to the Jewish people – or any other ethnic or religious . group. ‘Everyone knows Gerald Scarfe is . consistently brutal and bloody in his depictions, but last weekend – by . his own admission – he crossed a line. The timing, on Holocaust Memorial . Day, was inexcusable.’ In a statement Mr Ivens had said that insulting the memory of Holocaust victims . or invoking blood libel was 'the last thing I or anyone connected with . the Sunday Times would countenance'. 'The paper has long written strongly in defence of Israel and its security concerns, as have I as a columnist,' he said. 'We are, however, reminded of the . sensitivities in this area by the reaction to the cartoon, and I will, . of course, bear them very carefully in mind in future.' His apology followed that of Mr . Murdoch, who in a tweet, wrote: ‘Gerald Scarfe has never reflected the . opinions of the Sunday Times. 'Nevertheless, we owe major apology for . grotesque, offensive cartoon.’ In a message to the Jewish Chronicle, in which he denied the newspaper permission to reproduce the cartoon, he said he 'very much regrets' the timing of the cartoon. He said he had not been aware it was Holocaust Memorial Day. Rupert Murdoch said Gerald Scarfe (pictured), political cartoonist for the Sunday Times, did not reflect the views of the paper . Jewish community leaders said they . were disturbed by parallels they saw between the red-tinged drawing and . historical anti-Semitic propaganda. Speaking . to yesterday's Radio 4 Today programme, Stephen Pollard of the Jewish . Chronicle said: 'I think you have to separate the difference between the . right to publish something, and whether you always have to be . offensive. 'Clearly there was a mistake made in printing the cartoon. I think the cartoon itself is disgusting. 'Whether there is a right to publish . the cartoon is a different issue, I think it was a misjudgement and News . International have handled it absolutely right by apologising.' The Board of Deputies of British Jews said it had lodged a complaint with the Press Complaints Commission as his cartoon of . Netanyahu was reminiscent of a blood libel – the centuries-old racist . myth that Jews kill non-Jewish children to drink their blood. The deputies said in a statement that the depiction of a Jewish leader using blood for mortar 'is shockingly reminiscent of the blood libel imagery more usually found in parts of the virulently anti-Semitic Arab press'. Mick Davis, chairman of the Jewish Leadership Council, said he welcomed the ‘genuine apology’. Earlier, Lord Sacks said the cartoon ‘whether anti-Semitic or not, has caused immense pain to the Jewish community’. He added: ‘The danger of such images is that they reinforce a great slander of our time: that Jews, victims of the Holocaust, are now perpetrators of a similar crime against the Palestinians.’ Steve Bell, cartoonist in the Guardian, . jumped to the defence of Scarfe's cartoon. He said: 'For once, this . wasn't a bad cartoon. The problem with the state of Israel and the . Zionist lobby is that they never acknowledge the crime of ethnic . cleansing on which the state was founded.' Mr Scarfe said: ‘This drawing was a criticism of Netanyahu, and not of the Jewish people: there was no slight whatsoever intended against them.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Murdoch said cartoonist Gerald Scarfe doesn't reflect views of his paper .

A rare manuscript of a James Bond novel which is full of Ian Fleming's handwritten corrections is set to fetch £80,000. The Diamonds Are Forever script has Fleming's alterations on almost every page and had been prepared by his secretary Ulrica Knowles, a real-life Miss Moneypenny. A first edition of Fleming's completed novel with a note from the author to Knowles is also being offered for auction alongside the manuscript. A grateful Fleming sent his Miss Moneypenny, his secretary Ulrica Knowles, this personal note . Gratitude: A grateful Fleming sent his secretary a signed first edition of the book . The original text includes name changes for some of the key characters in the plot, whichtells the story of a diamond smuggling scheme involving American gangsters. The villain Dolly Kidd was originally called Boofy Gore, after Arthur 'Boofy' Gore who in reality was a close friend of the famed author. Fleming made the change at the last minute after Boofy rejected the cheeky attempt to use his name for the homosexual henchman of ruthless gang The Spangled Mob. Another notable alteration made by Fleming was changing the chapter 17 title from 'Bond forces the race' to 'Thanks for the ride'. Fleming also felt that more drama was needed for the novel's horse auction scene. In his own hand and on the side of the page, he wrote: 'A pause, a bang of a hammer, a look of sincere reproach towards the ringside seats where the big money sat,' to heighten the tension. The 57-year-old manuscript - the forth Bond novel - includes sweeping changes and deletions of whole passages of the text as well as alterations of single words. It was typed up by Fleming at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica in early 1955 before the editing process began. Original: Ian Fleming's final typescript for Diamonds Are Forever is being sold by Sothebys with a whopping £80,000 estimate . Ulrica Knowles would then help out with typing and re-typing as Fleming crafted his work into the famous series of best-selling spy novels. Knowles' value to the author can be seen in Fleming's note in the first edition Diamonds are Forever book he presented to her. The note reads: 'To Rica, Who wrote it. From Ian Fleming.' The first edition, complete with Fleming's note to Knowles, is expected to fetch £9,000 at auction. The master at work: Ian Fleming's original work of Diamonds Are Forever is set to go under the hammer . The items were owned by the Knowles family for many years before being acquired by a private UK-based collector. Dr Gabriel Heaton, literature . specialist at auctioneers Sotheby's, said: 'What we have here is a . typescript about mid-way through the composition process. 'The novel has its shape but what he is doing here is honing the narrative of the prose. 'You get that terse nature of Fleming's prose. 'His . re-written sentences tend to be shorter than the originals and there is . also a great passage in there where he heightens the drama of an . auction. 'Fleming used to enjoy naming his characters after people he knew in real life. 'Fleming changed the name of 'Boofy Gore' to 'Dolly Kidd' after the real Boofy, his old schoolfriend, objected. 'He did not appreciate it and fortunately for 'Boofy' he was asked beforehand and the name was changed in the final version. 'There is a huge amount of interest in Ian Fleming and James Bond at present. 'There are relatively few manuscripts and typescripts of the James Bond novels which come to the market.

"By . Thomas Durante, Reuters Reporter and Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 14:05 EST, 20 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:24 EST, 20 February 2013 . It's double trouble for Nike and Oakley, which have been forced to sever ties with two of their top athletic moneymakers in a matter of months after respective falls from grace. Both companies announced this week they would drop sprinter Oscar Pistorius after the double amputee was charged with the murder of model girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine's Day. The separation came just months since the same two athletic outfitters left the side of Lance Armstrong as his role was revealed in one of the most sophisticated doping scandals of all time. Fall from grace: Oscar Pistorius, pictured in Oakley sunglasses, was dropped by the company after he was charged with the murder of his girlfriend . Dropped: Both Nike and Oakley also cut ties with Lance Armstrong as his role was revealed in one of the most sophisticated doping scandals of all time . On Monday, Nike pulled a 2007 internet ad starring Pistorius, in which he says: 'I am the bullet in the chamber.' Spokesman KeJuan Wilkins told the Associated Press that Nike 'felt it was appropriate to take the ad down from Oscar's website recognizing the sensitivities of the situation.' Have disgraced athletes like Pistorius and Armstrong tarnished your perception of Nike? Also on Monday, Oakley, known for its sleek sunglasses, said in a statement: 'In light of the recent allegations, Oakley is suspending its contract with Oscar Pistorius, effective immediately.' The California company, a unit of Italy-based Luxottica Group, has been associated with Pistorius since 2009, according to the athlete's website. Oakley was also a major sponsor of Armstrong for 25 years - dating back to when he was a teenage triathlete - but their links to the now infamous drugs cheat fizzled in October 2012. Takeaway: Following the murder allegations against Pistorius, Nike pulled a 2007 internet ad, in which he says: 'I am the bullet in the chamber' Nike followed suit after U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) findings showed the seven-time Tour de France winner's years of doping and use of performance-enhancing drugs. The USADA report led to Armstrong's interview with Oprah Winfrey in January, when he finally admitted that his drug cocktails played a role in all seven of his Tour victories. After the interview aired, Nike said in a statement: 'Due to the seemingly insurmountable evidence that Lance Armstrong participated in doping and misled Nike for more than a decade, it is with great sadness that we have terminated our contract with him. 'Nike does not condone the use of illegal performance enhancing drugs in any manner.' Support: Nike famously stood by Tiger Woods, right, during his infidelity scandal, and rekindled its relationship with Michael Vick, left, after his dogfighting conviction . In the sun: Oakley, which is known for its sleek eyewear, continues its partnership with the Livestrong with these special edition sunglasses . Both companies, however, said they would continue to support . the cancer-fighting initiative Livestrong, which the disgraced cyclist started . in 1997. Nike famously stood by Tiger Woods in late 2009 when he became wrapped in . one of the most notorious infidelity scandals in professional sports. The sports retailer also rekindled its professional relationship with quarterback Michael Vick after he served eight months in jail following his dogfighting conviction and returned to the NFL. If Pistorius is found guilty in his own trial, he will join Armstrong . as athletes who may never race again, an extreme sign of bad luck for . their sponsors, who dish out hundreds of millions for top-tiered talent to pitch their products. In court: Pistorius' eyes well up with tears during Day 2 of his bail hearing on Wednesday . Both Nike and Oakley did not return messages from MailOnline for comment. The arrest of Pistorius, 26, an Olympic . and Paralympic sprinter, stunned the millions who held him up as a hero . for overcoming adversity to compete with able-bodied athletes at the . highest level. Tragic end: Reeva Steenkamp was shot dead by Pistorius, who claims that he thought she was an intruder, on Valentine's Day . Steenkamp was gunned down in Pistorius' South Africa, home in the early hours of Thursday morning. At his bail hearing today, the detective leading the murder investigation, Hilton Botha, said that 'non-stop shouting' was heard in the home before Steenkamp was shot dead. Pistorius, known as 'the blade runner,' was seen sobbing as Botha testified. His defense team has disputed the findings, and argues that he thought Steenkamp was an intruder when he shot through the bathroom door. Yesterday, Pistorius said in his sworn statement that after opening fire, he realized that Steenkamp was not in his bed. 'It filled me with horror and fear,' Pistorius said. The 26-year-old Olympian said he put on his prosthetic legs and tried to kick down the door before finally bashing it in with a cricket bat. Inside, he found Steenkamp, slumped over. He said he lifted her bloodied body into his arms and tried to carry her downstairs to seek medical help. But by then, it was too late. 'She died in my arms,' the athlete said.","Both companies cut ties with disgraced star athletes after their respective scandals .

Scandal-plagued former French presidential hopeful Dominique Strauss-Kahn has been branded the ‘king of the pigs’ in an explosive book written by an embittered ex-lover. Argentine lawyer Marcela Iacub claimed the disgraced ex-International Monetary Fund chief would have turned the Elysee Palace into a ‘swingers’ club’ if he’d been elected president. The 48-year-old legal expert said she had a steamy seven-month affair with Strauss-Kahn, 64, after he was cleared of raping a maid at a New York hotel. Kiss and tell: Argentine lawyer Marcela Iacub (left) has branded her former lover Dominique Strauss-Kahn (right) the 'king of the pigs' in an explosive new book . Scathing: In her lurid memoir Beauty and the Beast (above), she claims the disgraced ex-International Monetary Fund chief would have turned the Elysee Palace into a 'swingers' club' if he'd been elected president . In excerpts of her lurid memoir ‘Beauty and the Beast’ published in France yesterday, she claimed that had he become the French president, he would have ‘used your assistants, henchmen, advisers and staff as touts, orgy organisers, experts in the art of satisfying your darkest urges.' ‘You claimed that you were ready to give your blood for your country when in fact you would have used this country to spill your inexhaustible sperm,’ she added in an open letter to her former lover. After meeting Mr Strauss-Kahn in January last year, Miss Iacub said she fell completely in love with the man she described as the ‘king of the pigs’ and ‘half man, half pig.’ ‘Pigs have a relationship with the present that humans hardly have. They never cease relishing the incredible luck of being alive, eating, running, sullying, wounding, feeling.’ Withering: Miss Iacub also turns on Strauss-Kahn's estranged wife, Anne Sinclair (left), whom she claims dreamt of being First Lady and treated her husband like a 'poodle' ‘You have had a long list of sexual conquests ... of mostly vulgar and unattractive women,’ she wrote. ‘It is one of the authentic and wonderful traits of the true pig, a form of generosity that you show to all women prepared to receive you.’ The pair met in January 2012 after Miss Iacub wrote an essay defending Strauss-Kahn. He subsequently texted her: ‘You who like writing, tell me what you want to do with me later.’ In love: The 48-year-old legal expert said she had an affair with DSK after he was cleared of raping Nafissatou Diallo (pictured) at a New York hotel . There followed a seven-month affair in which Miss Iacub said she fell totally in love. Miss Iacub saves her fiercest words for Strauss Kahn’s estranged wife, Anne Sinclair, whom she claims dreamt of being First Lady and thought she and her husband ‘belonged to the caste of the masters of the world’. She says she treated her husband like ‘a poodle’. The claims drew a furious response from both Mr Strauss-Kahn and Miss Sinclair. Strauss-Kahn said he felt ‘doubly disgusted’ by the ‘inaccurate’ account of their relationship. ‘Disgusted . that a woman would seduce a man with the sole intention of writing a . book about it, of feigning love for financial gain, for selling her . story through a press she has always been critical of,’ he wrote to Le . Nouvel Observateur, the left-wing French magazine that printed the . excerpts. In a separate . response, Miss Sinclair told Le Nouvel Observateur: ‘You give credit to . the manoeuvres of a perverse and dishonest woman, driven by a . fascination for the sensational and the lure of money.’ Strauss-Kahn . was accused of rape by New York hotel maid Nafissatou Diallo in May . 2011.

'Stupid behaviour': Anton Rodgers, the son of Liverpool football boss Brendan Rodgers admitted having a photograph taken exposing himself in front of a girl, his trial heard . The son of Liverpool football manager Brendan Rodgers today admitted having a photograph taken exposing himself in front of a girl, but claimed it was just ‘boy banter', a court heard. Anton Rodgers, 19, denied he and three of his team mates sexually assaulted the teenage girl, saying she was awake and giggling throughout the horseplay. He said he joined in the 'boy banter' because he wanted to fit in as he was a new member of the Brighton and Hove team, but he admitted that with hindsight that it was ‘stupid behaviour’. Rodgers, a midfielder with the Championship club, is alleged to be one of four footballers who took snaps of the drunk blonde, whose drink may have been spiked, as they exposed themselves and made vulgar poses around her. The girl only realised what had happened to her when she woke up semi-naked next to Rodgers in the Jury’s Inn hotel in Brighton the next morning, the court heard. Jurors were told she borrowed Rodgers’ mobile phone and came across the pictures of a blonde woman in a pink dress ‘clearly not awake’ with men masturbating around her. But today Rodgers, 19, denied anything sexual was going on. He told the jury he and his team mates had gone out after celebrating their 2-0 pre-season victory over Eastbourne FC on July 16, 2011 and he saw the girl 'being flirtatious' with another player. Rodgers, who had only signed with the club three to four weeks before on £250 a week, said he only spoke briefly to the girl who wanted to know why first team player Leon Redwood was not paying any attention to her. At around 2am, he returned to the hotel with George Barker, 21, to go to bed, but was a woken half an hour later when his teams mates Steve Cook and Lewis Dunk, both 21, came into his room with the girl. He said there was a 'jovial, laughing atmosphere' and the girl 'seemed content.' He said: 'It was still a jokey atmosphere. I remember Steve being quite drunk but he was being quite funny. He was one of the main characters in the team.' He said the girl who was wearing a tight dress then cuddled up between him and George who were in the double bed adding; 'She moved on to me and tried to kiss my neck but I ended up shrugging her off. 'She tried to grab my penis area and I said to her to get off. I had no interest in what she seemed to be intent on. 'It appeared she was doing the same to George, I can’t recall them snogging but I could hear the same thing.' He said Lewis and Steve were giggling too and they started taking photos on his phone but he denied there was any sexual gratification to it. He said: 'No no. This was never the case. It was just a laugh. I understand now how stupid it was now but honest, it was just a bit of boy banter. It was jokey. As I said it was just boy banter, a good laugh. 'She was just giggling. She seemed to be laughing with us.' Allegation: The girl only realised what had happened to her when she woke up semi-naked next to Rodgers in the Jury's Inn hotel (above) in Brighton the next morning, the court heard . But he added the atmospheres changed when Leon walked into the room. He said: 'It seemed she was laughing, being bubbly and then that’s when she shut her eyes and seemed to be trying to go to sleep. I was awkward but Leon broke the awkwardness by laughing as well. From what I remember he sprayed the shaving foam on her leg.' He said a picture was taken of George grinning with his thumbs up after writing his initials in shaving foam on her thigh and then they all left and they went to sleep. The next morning the girl 'politely' asked to borrow his phone to make a call and then ten minutes later woke him because she had discovered the images and said: 'I think she was embarrassed' He agreed to delete the pictures but forwarded the one with George and the shaving phone via BlackBerry messaging. Rodgers and his team-mates Lewis Dunk (left) and George Barker (right) all deny sexual assault and voyeurism . Steve Cook, who now plays for Bournemouth, also denies sexual assault and voyeurism . He and his team mates thought nothing more of the incident until they were arrested as they got off the team coach after returning from Wrexham in January of last year adding 'This was a shock.' Talking about when he exposed his penis he said: 'I was standing directly above her but that was it. I was not kneeling down or crouching. I was standing on the bed while she was laughing. 'It was a laugh, I was new at the time. It was funny at the time. Looking back at it, it was just the case of fitting in and having a laugh.' It is alleged the ‘pretty, outgoing’ woman, now 21, had asked Rodgers to delete the photos but he just laughed. She later confided in a work colleague what had happened, but was too scared to go to police. It was not until another player told her months later that the pictures were being passed around the club and threatened to post them on the internet that she finally reported it. Rodgers, Barker, Dunk and their former team-mate Cook, 21, who now plays for Bournemouth, all deny charges of sexual assault and voyeurism. The Old Bailey heard they went to several bars and she ended up coming back to their hotel room. But she claims the next thing she remembers is waking up in bed with Rodgers in just his underwear with her bra off and her dress pulled up. When interviewed by police, Rodgers refused to answer questions and the other three gave very basic accounts of what had happened that night. Barker said there was only one picture taken of him with the shaving foam, Dunk claimed he had fallen asleep while Cook admitted he may have been in the background but did not get his penis out. The foam picture was discovered on Barker’s phone when he was arrested. The trial continues.

The owner of British Gas faces a consumer backlash amid reports it is about to announce a 15 per cent increase in profits, taking the figure to some £2.8billion. Figures to be announced by Centrica on Wednesday point to a profits bonanza on the back of spiralling bills for struggling customers. The profits at British Gas, which put up prices by six per cent in the teeth of the winter chill, are predicted to be up by some 10 per cent to around £580million for 2012. Profit bonanza: The parent company of British Gas faces a backlash amid reports it is to announce a 15 per cent increase in profits on the back of spiralling bills for struggling customers . The company is also under fire over payments to the departing British Gas boss, Phil Bentley, who is predicted to walk away with a package of pay, shares and a pension pot together worth more than £10million. Centrica has tried to pre-empt the furore by publishing a study boasting about its beneficial effects on the wider UK economy in terms of employment, investment and the tax it pays. Chief executive Sam Laidlaw said its contribution to the economy was equivalent to a city the size of Manchester, and its tax bill amounted to £158 for every UK household. ‘At a time of uncertain economic prospects, our activities across the UK are even more important to secure employment, put the supply chain to work and contribute our fair share of tax,’ he said. The company employs some 33,000 . people in the UK, while total tax paid is expected to rise from £891m in . 2011 to around £1.1 billion in 2012. Payout: Centrica is also under fire over payments worth more than £10million to the departing British Gas boss, Phil Bentley . Unlike . most energy firms operating in the UK, it is wholly British and pays . its taxes in this country. Most of its major rivals for UK customers are . foreign owned by German, French and Spanish utility firms. While that may appeal to the patriotism of its 10 million UK consumers, it does not make the pain of paying for heat and light any easier to bear. The national average gas and electricity bill is approaching £1,300, while millions face a nightmare choice during cold spells between heating and eating. British Gas claims a profit margin of some 5per cent - around £65 a year – which it insists is modest when compared to other businesses, such as supermarkets. The industry blames rising wholesale costs for higher bills, while it also points to expensive government ‘green’ initiatives, such as subsidising the building of wind farms and the installation of free insulation into the homes of vulnerable customers. The official customer body, Consumer Focus, says the public remain sceptical about whether they are paying a fair price. Executive director at consumer champion, Which?, Richard Lloyd, said: ‘At a time when spiralling energy bills are consumers’ top financial worry, people are bound to question whether they’re paying a fair price for their energy when they see big profits announcements from the energy giants. ‘Centrica’s analysis won’t change that view as record-high bills land on millions of doormats in the coming weeks.’ The Prime Minister has announced that . energy firms will be required to simplify their tariffs and move . customers to the cheapest option. Talking taxes: The Prime Minister has announced that energy firms will be required to simplify their tariffs and move customers to the cheapest option . However, Mr Lloyd said the proposals do not go far enough and it will remain extremely difficult for householders to identify the cheapest supplier. ‘The Government should take more radical action to provide not just simpler but fairer bills.’ Said Mr Lloyd. ‘Prices will only be kept as low as possible if there is more effective competition and switching between energy companies. ‘For this to happen the price of every tariff should be presented in a clear, consistent and simple way, through single unit prices like those for petrol and diesel, so people can easily spot the cheapest deal - not just with their current supplier but across the market.’","Parent company Centrica is about to announce profits of £2.8billion .

Beko was warned by London Fire Brigade in June 2010 about some of its fridge freezers (file photo) A firm which has household appliances in thousands of homes has been accused of making death trap machines responsible for at least 11 fatalities. Beko makes fridge freezers and tumble driers under its own name, which have all been subject to safety recalls. It is now under threat from a series of lawsuits over deaths caused by fires and carbon monoxide poisoning linked to some of its appliances. Beko is at the centre of a £1.5million legal action by Jennifer Benjamin, a paediatrician, who lost her husband in a fire at their home in Wealdstone, north London. The firm was warned by London Fire Brigade in a letter in June 2010 that some of its fridge freezers were a ‘potential threat to life’ after a series of fires. However, the company allegedly failed to issue a swift public alert and Mrs Benjamin’s husband, Santosh Benjamin-Muthiah, 36, died some five months later. The Microsoft employee died from the effects of the fire and smoke inhalation in hospital a few days after helping to rescue the couple’s two young children. The family’s lawyers served a letter before action on the company last week ahead of a preliminary inquest into his death. Mrs Benjamin believes far more should have been done to alert the public to the dangers with the firm’s fridge freezers, which were known to overheat, so making them a fire risk. ‘It’s still very painful for us. These products are faulty and the public need to be made aware of it,’ she said. However, this is not an isolated incident. Beko was warned in November 2008 of a potentially lethal flaw in some of its gas cookers after three deaths from carbon monoxide poisoning. An advertising campaign was launched three months later, by which time three more people had died. Four other people are believed to have been killed by the cookers. Father-of-two Santosh Benjamin-Muthiah died in November 2010 after a fire in his home . Beko was warned in November 2008 over gas cookers after deaths from carbon monoxide poisoning were linked to its appliances . Customers whose faulty Beko tumble . driers have apparently caused house fires say they received no alerts . from the company, despite records of their purchases. Jill . Paterson, a specialist product liability lawyer at Leigh Day, said she . was alarmed at the significant number of serious incidents allegedly . involving Beko products. She claimed there were still tens of . thousands of Beko appliances in people’s homes that were potential fire . risks, while she said the company had failed to issue early alerts and . make sure that customers were notified. ‘It is irresponsible that they appear to be dragging their feet over products which can cause injury and deaths,’ she said. It is expected that other lawsuits will be launched against the company. Internet forums are full of complaints . from customers who have had enormous difficulty in getting repairs . needed to potentially lethal machines. Beko is a brand of the Turkish . appliance manufacturer, Arcelik and makes some one in five of all new . white goods sold in the UK each year. Its managing director, Ragip Balcioglu, insisted all its products are subject to rigorous European Union testing and standards. ‘We . will not rest until we have done everything in our power to track down . any potentially affected products where an issue has been identified,’ he said. The company said: 'Beko sincerely regrets any incident linked to any of our products. We would like to express our deepest condolences to the families and friends of affected customers.

Two schoolboys caught with 75 wraps of heroin and crack cocaine as they queued for breakfast in a McDonald's have been spared prison - because they're just 15-years-old. The teenagers were searched by police after CCTV operators said they were 'acting suspiciously’ and 'exchanging glances' in a shopping centre. They had £750 in drugs and £220 in cash on them along with a mobile phone that had been used earlier that day to sell drugs to addicts. The pair, who cannot be named, admitted . possessing Class A drugs with intent to supply at Bolton Crown Court but were spared jail . because of their ages. Arrested: Two schoolboys were caught with 75 wraps of heroin and crack cocaine as they about to order breakfast at McDonald's at the Millgate shopping centre (pictured) in Bury, Greater Manchester . The two schoolboys were arrested at 10.15am in a McDonald's in Mill Gate at the Rock Centre in Bury while on their school summer holidays on August 7 last year. Simon Barrett, prosecuting, said: 'Police officers attended the McDonald's restaurant in Bury following reports of two males acting suspiciously. 'They searched them under the Misuse of Drugs Act. Officers found on them wraps of both crack cocaine and heroin and also cash. 'They had also dropped a phone - it was clearly a dealer’s phone and contained text messages consistent with dealing drugs.' The court heard how the two boys were acting as drug runners and had been promised commission if they managed to get rid of the stash. One of the boys was carrying 10 wraps of crack cocaine and 19 wraps of heroin while the other teenager had 14 wraps of crack cocaine and 32 wraps of heroin. The two schoolboys were stopped by police as they queued at a McDonald's in Bury, Manchester, stock image . The court heard the £200 cash was from drug deals they'd made earlier that day. Mr Barrett added: 'They had taken the drugs off a third party and they were being paid to sell it on. 'The money was from drug dealing, they had been selling the drugs earlier that day - they made admissions when they were interviewed by the police. The younger boy was told he would be paid £50 to help get rid of the supply while the older teenager had been promised £1.50 'commission' for every wrap he sold. In mitigation, defence lawyers for . the boys said they had never touched drugs or been involved in any . previous drug-related crime. The teenagers jointly had 14 wraps of crack cocaine, stock image pictured, on them when searched by police . Stuart Duke, who represented the younger of the two boys, said: 'These are extremely serious offences - when children, 15-year-old boys, are dealing crack cocaine and heroin - if my client was of adult age, he would serve four years imprisonment. 'Anything I say, doesn’t decry from the seriousness of the offence he’s pleaded guilty to. 'He’s never fallen foul of the criminal justice system before. 'He’s a young man who has learning difficulties; he attends a school for men with learning difficulties. He doesn’t really know what heroin and crack cocaine is.' Passing sentence, the judge Mr Recorder Paul O’Brien handed the older boy, now 16, a 12-month youth rehabilitation order, a 12-month supervision requirement, an activity requirement and an electronically-tagged curfew between 7am and 7pm. He ordered the younger defendant to complete a 12-month intensive referral order and to abide by a doorstep three-month curfew between 7am and 7pm. Recorder O’Brien reminded the boys they would have been locked up for at least four years if they were adults. He added: 'You must understand how desperately seriously this is.' Inspector Charlotte Cadden, speaking at the time of the incident, said: 'It is extremely saddening to see such young men caught red-handed with so many drugs. 'Drugs are a blight on our community and whether you are 15 or 50, dealing drugs is a very serious offence. We will continue to work closely with all our partner agencies and when we receive intelligence of possible drug dealing, we will take action.'

"By . Hannah Roberts and Hugo Gye . PUBLISHED: . 09:26 EST, 25 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:02 EST, 26 February 2013 . Panic spread through European stock markets yesterday as political paralysis in Italy sent shares tumbling. The FTSE 100 index fell 84.93 points to 6270.44, wiping £21.5billion off the value of Britain’s blue chip firms. The losses were worse on the Continent with the stock market down 4.9 per cent in Milan, 3.2 per cent in Madrid, 2.7 per cent in Paris and 2.3 per cent in Frankfurt. Bank shares were the biggest fallers. Barclays and RBS lost more than 4 per cent. The cost of borrowing surged in Italy and the cost of insuring the country’s debt against default climbed to its highest this year. Choice: The split between the centre right forces of Silvio Berlusconi (left) and the centre left forces of Pier Luigi Bersani (right) raised the real prospect of a fresh election . The markets plunged across the world . after the Italian election resulted in deadlock thanks to one of the . largest protest votes in living memory. The result in Italy is expected to . slow the country's recent economic gains, and threatens to tip the . entire eurozone back into full-blown crisis mode. In . a rejection of the austerity reforms needed to ease the country’s . massive debt, more than a quarter of voters backed the Five Star . Movement, led by comedian Beppe Grillo. Meanwhile, . the disgraced former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi unexpectedly . exploded back on the scene with 29.2 per cent of the vote. German tabloid newspaper Bild expressed . its horror at the election result and renewed instability in the . financial markets with the headline, 'Are they going to destroy our euro . now?' Mr Grillo's anti-euro and anti-austerity . party, which took 25.6 per cent of the votes, was the most popular single party in Italy. The Five Star Movement drew support away from both . major parties, leading to the prospect of months of deadlock as . politicans attempt to form a new government. The centre-left groups, led by Pier Luigi Bersani, had 29.5 per . cent of the vote in the lower house, only just ahead of Mr Berlusconi's centre-right alliance. Mr Grillo took to the internet to taunt the country's mainstream politicians over their disappointing performance. 'We've started a war of generations,' he said in a statement posted on his website. 'They are all losers, they've been there for 25 to 30 years and they've led this country to catastrophe.' The charismatic anti-politician, who was once convicted of manslaughter, has vowed not to join a coalition with any other party, meaning politicians face deadlock in their attempts to form a government. Looking positive: Five Star Movement leader and comedian Beppe Grillo and his wife Parvin Tadjik . 'The . winner is: Ingovernability' was the headline in Il Messaggero, while . commentator Massimo Giannini wrote in La Repubblica: 'The ""non-party"" has become the largest party in the country.' Despite Mr Grillo's success, a . coalition between the centre-left and centre-right could be the most . likely outcome after Mr Berlusconi this morning suggested he would . consider teaming up with Mr Bersani, saying that both parties 'must be . prepared to make sacrifices' and rejecting the possibility of fresh elections. The centre-left was left in a state of shock by the results after failing to achieve the resounding win it had been expecting. Enrico Letta, a senior member of Mr Bersani's party, insisted that his grouping should be first in line to try and form a government, while the leader said: 'We will handle the responsibilities that these elections have given us in Italy’s interest.' Turnout was unusually low at 75 . per cent - historically, it has usually been above 80 per cent, though . this is the first national election held during winter. Plunge: Japanese markets were the first to fall today, sparking a global sell-off of shares after the election . Mr Bersani is guaranteed a majority . in the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, due to election rules . giving the largest alliance more than 50 per cent of the seats. But the situation in the Senate is . much more confused - Mr Berlusconi's group is likely to be the largest . with 116 seats, with Mr Bersani close behind on 113, but no party is . close to a majority. The party headed by current prime . minister Mario Monti, who has emphasised the need for radical economic . reforms and continued austerity, performed disappointingly, attracting . just 10.6 per cent of votes. Mr Monti took over the government in November 2011, with the support of both major parties, and pulled Italy back from the brink of an EU bailout by restoring investor confidence and lowering the interest rate on the country's bonds, which was unsustainably high. This split raised the prospect of . a fresh election – and further delay to much-needed economic reforms in . the single currency’s third largest economy. Competition: Mario Monti casting his vote- Mr Monti's party is expected to gain fourth place . Mr . Bersani, who was widely considered the favourite, has a reformist track . record and has worked closely with Mr Monti, leading to hopes that he . would continue along the same path. However, . the election results mean that if he is to have any hope of power he . will depend on either Mr Grillo or the mercurial Mr Berlusconi, who are . likely to reject the austerity demanded by the German government and . other international lenders. If investors begin to doubt that . Italy will enact reforms to keep its economy on track, the damage will . quickly spread to other European countries, amidst fears that Italy is . too large for an EU bailout. Leading centrists in the country . lamented the results - Gianfranco Fini, a former foreign minister who . lost his parliamentary seat in the election, said: 'The worst is yet to . come for Italy.' Paul Mortimer Lee, global head of market economics at BNP Paribas, said today that the election result was likely to shave up to one per cent from Italy's growth rate this year. ‘There’s no alternative to the austerity that the EU wants,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'But the politicians are not going to offer that up on a plate because it’s a recipe for rejection. ‘The Italian people are saying we don’t want to do the hard yards. The news will have to get worse and a lot worse before it gets better.’ Decisions: People read electoral information banners in a polling station in Rome during Italy's general elections . As soon as results started . to be declared last night, the euro began falling, reaching a seven-week low against the dollar by this morning. The single currency has rallied strongly in recent weeks as fears of an imminent break-up of the eurozone eased. But analysts said a change of . government in Italy – and the possible return of Mr Berlusconi – could see . the austerity measures implemented by outgoing leader Mr Monti . reversed and plunge the economy deeper into crisis. The Five Star Movement has come from nowhere in three years to secure . the vote of one in four Italians. Its 64-year-old leader, Mr Grillo, . attracted hundreds of thousands of supporters as he toured town squares . in a camper van. Much of his support comes from young Italians, who are . frustrated by never-ending corruption scandals and mobilised by . social media. Shock: Opinion polls had underestimated the appeal of the Five Star Movement in the run-up to the election . Fragmented: Seats in the Senate are allocated on the basis of the country's regions . Earlier exit polls had shown the . centre-left coalition ahead in both houses. But initial optimism from . market investors soon evaporated once later projections pointed to a . lead for Mr Berlusconi’s centre-right coalition. The former premier, who resigned 15 . months ago after bringing Italy to the brink of economic ruin, has made . an astonishing comeback. His trial, on charges of paying for . sex with an underage girl, has been postponed until after the election. Mr Bersani, a former communist, would have to win both houses to form a . stable government. He has said he would continue with reforms begun by . technocrat Mr Monti. The country is likely to endure political horse-trading over the next few days to try to appoint a government. If no party can form a majority, . another caretaker technocratic government may have to take power until . fresh elections can be held in May. Robert O’Daly, of the Economist . Intelligence Unit, said: ‘Under a scenario where the combined . parliamentary representation of Mr Bersani’s centre-left and Mr Monti’s . centrists is insufficient to form a majority, a period of minority . government followed by further elections would be likely. ‘Such an outcome would place strong . additional upward pressure on government borrowing costs. If this were . to continue for a prolonged period, it could be destabilising for other . distressed peripheral euro area countries.’","Euro tumbles over prospect of coalition haggling and new elections .

The bloody sock worn by ex-Boston Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling during the 2004 World Series, that was potentially to sell for over $600,000 landed well below at $92,000. The sock went up for live auction on Friday in New York by Texas-based Heritage Auctions. The bidding began at $25,000 and it was an anonymous participant who placed the winning bid according to The Boston Globe. Blood money: Curt Schilling's bloody sock, shown here during the 2004 World Series, is expected to fetch as much as $600,000 . 'This is obviously the first time we've ever offered a sock at auction,' Chris Ivy, Director of Sports Auctions for Heritage, told CNBC. 'But it relates to a very significant moment in the World Series.' Schilling was wearing the sock when he pitched the baseball championship game on October 24, 2004 with a damaged tendon, which led to the bleeding. Though he could barely walk, he pitched six innings, only allowing a single run. That Game 2 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals paved the way for the Red Sox to secure their first championship in 86 years, ending the 'Curse of the Bambino' that has hung over the Boston team since 1918, when the Red Sox sold star slugger Babe Ruth to the Yankees. The sock previously had been on loan to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. It has been at Heritage's Dallas headquarters for several weeks and on display at the auction house's Manhattan office before it is sold. Spectacle: The bloody sock was previously on display, along with the cleats that Schilling wore during the World Series game, at the National Baseball Hall of Fame . Schilling is putting the sock up for auction given the retired MLB star has not found success in his post-baseball career. Schilling's company, 38 Studios, was . lured to Providence, Rhode Island, from Massachusetts with a $75 million . loan guarantee in 2010. In May, it laid off all its employees and it filed for bankruptcy in June. The state is now likely responsible for some $100 million related to the deal, including interest. Schilling also had personally guaranteed loans to the company and listed the sock as bank collateral in a September filing with the Massachusetts secretary of state's office. He has said he invested as much as $50million in 38 Studios and has lost all his baseball earnings. He told WEEI-AM in Boston last year that possibly having to sell the sock was part of 'having to pay for your mistakes.' 'I'm obligated to try and make amends and, unfortunately, this is one of the byproducts of that,' he told the station. Fall: Schilling is believed to have lost $50million that he had invested into video game company 38 Studios, which filed for bankruptcy last year . The bloody sock is one of two that sent Schilling into the annals of baseball lore in 2004. The . other was from Game 6 of the American League Championship Series, when . Schilling pitched against the New York Yankees with an injured ankle. That sock is said to have been discarded in the trash at Yankees Stadium. The hall had had the sock since 2004. Heritage . last May auctioned off the so-called 'Bill Buckner ball,' which rolled . through the legs of the Red Sox first baseman in the 1986 World Series. Ivy . said that item, like Schilling's sock, was listed at the time as being . expected to bring in '$100,000-plus,' but it was sold to an anonymous . bidder for $418,000. 'We wouldn't be surprised to see this do something in that range,' he said, estimating the sock could be sold for as much as $600,000.

A group of Americans held hostage at the U.S. embassy in Iran for 444 days in 1979, are taking their battle for justice to Congress. The 52 embassy workers were taken hostage on November 4, 1979, when revolutionary militants stormed the Teheran building and suffered more than a year of physical and mental torture at the hands of their captors. More than three decades later the victims and their survivors have yet to receive compensation, prohibited to bring a case against Iran due to the terms of the release . agreement from 1981. Survivor: Steven Lauterbach cut his wrists during his 444 days held hostage, in the hope that he would be so badly hurt that he would be released from solitary confinement . Captive: One of the 52 U.S. hostages is displayed to the crowd outside the U.S. Embassy in Tehran by his captors, a few days into their ordeal . However, they are hoping to end their . 33-year-long battle for justice by persuading Capitol Hill to aid them . in their quest for a court judgment against Iran as a state sponsor of . terrorism. Steven Lauterbach, 61, was the assistant general services officer at the US Embassy in 1979. His statement to the Congress begin with the words: ‘I slashed my wrists in Iran’. Locked in solitary confinement Mr Lauterbach, 28 at the time of the seige, believed it was his only way out. ‘I wanted to hurt myself bad enough that they would panic,’ he told the National Journal. He was found covered in blood and says he was ‘ready to die,’ but the militants managed to get him to a hospital in time. Now he suffers from recurring nightmares that the deal has been rescinded and he will have to go back to his captors. 'It’s never completely in the past,’ he says. ‘You’re always in the shadow of it psychologically.’ Scarred for life: Rodney 'Rocky' Sickmann was only 22 when he was taken hostage in November 1979 and says Iran 'raped' him of his freedom . Blame: Deborah Firestone, daughter of a hostage says the 444 days as a hostage changed her father and is the reason why she has not seen him for eight years . Paraded: The blindfolded and bound man from the 52 held hostage is taken outside the embassy by the young militia in the early days of the hostage-taking . Held: A photograph from November 1979 shows two Iranian militants with a female hostage at the U.S. embassy . ‘Iran raped us of our freedom,’ says Rodney 'Rocky' Sickmann, who, aged 22, was the youngest hostage taken. Mr Sickmann spent the first month in . captivity sleeping with his hands tied to his feet, and describes . how the hostages were forced to watch torture videos of people being . dipped in boiling tar or shot in the head in front of the camera. To this day he still suffers from flashbacks, has trouble being alone and say he will never forget his time in captivity. The Iranian hostage crisis began on November 4, 1979 when young militants calling themselves Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line, supporters of the Iranian Revolution, stormed the U.S. Embassy in Teheran. The storming of the embassy was a result of mounting hostility against the U.S. after the exiled Shah of Iran was allowed to enter the America for cancer treatment . Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, was installed and supported by both the U.S. and the UK governments but his rule was overthrown shortly after his exile in January 1979 and replaced with an Islamic republic. In April 1980 there was a failed attempt to rescue the hostages which resulted in the deaths of eight American servicemen, one Iranian civilian, and the destruction of two aircraft. The release of the hostages was prompted by the invasion of Iran by Saddam Hussein, then leader of Iraq, in combination with the death om the exiled Shah. The Algiers Accords was signed on January 20, 1981 by President Ronald Reagan, just minutes after he was sworn into office. All hostages were released the following day after one year, two months, two weeks and two days in captivity. Army . Colonel Leland Holland who died in 1990, would tell his children of being . beaten with rubber hoses and telephone books. Thrice in the years . following his release, his family found him kneeling against a wall in . the basement with his hands over his head as if he was handcuffed. Former . hostage Bruce German, 76, says he was under constant threat during his . time as a hostage. He recalls how the group would be awoken in the . middle of the night, stripped and blindfolded for mock-executions. His daughter, Deborah Firestone wrote a letter to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini during her father’s capture begging for his release. ‘Dear Ayatollah,' she wrote 'I wish you could convince your people to let my dad come home to his family. ‘It is very difficult for me not having my dad around.’ When her father finally returned, he was a changed man. Ms Firestone recalls watching her parents marriage fall apart, after which Mr German moved away. He missed her college graduation as well as both her and her brother’s weddings. She has not seen her father for eight years. Over the years the 52 hostages, 12 of which have passed since they were freed, have tried and failed to get justice and relief in American courts multiple times. This is due to the 1981 Algiers Accords, a deal brokered between the U.S. and Iran by Algeria, which saw the hostages released. President Carter signed the agreement which included a clause prohibiting the 52 hostages from bringing a lawsuit against Iran in a US court. The hostages and their families did . bring a case against Iran in 2000 and won a default liability ruling . after the state of Iran failed to mount a defense. However, the State Department argued to dismiss the case as it would violate an agreement signed by a U.S. president. Compensation and justice: Bill Daugherty is estimating that each hostage should be awarded nearly $18million for their ordeal . Arguing . that the Congress has never specifically invalidated the Algiers . Accords, District Judge Emmet Sullivan ruled to dismiss the case in . 2002.

A young mum put on a DVD at home and to her horror found herself watching movie footage of her own baby boy being tortured in his cot. The traumatized woman in her 20’s, saw her 15-month-old child slapped, poked in the face and bombarded repeatedly with a ball, a Crown Court heard. The shocking film of the baby sobbing in terror was made by the 24-year-old man who carried out the sadistic assaults. Appalling cruelty: Mark Weatherall, 24, pictured, who filmed himself torturing a 15-month-old baby in its cot, was sentenced to a year in jail . Mark Weatherall, a builder’s labourer of Birtley Green, near Guildford, Surrey, was jailed for 12 months at Guildford Crown Court after pleading guilty to child cruelty. The horrifying home movie was shown to a hushed courtroom before the defendant was sentenced. A member of the public sitting in the court’s gallery fled the room in tears after witnessing the graphic scenes of the tiny victim’s suffering. Sending Weatherall to prison, Judge Christopher Critchlow told him: 'Anybody watching that would be appalled by what you did'. Judge Christopher Critchlow, pictured, told Weatherall: 'Anybody watching that would be appalled by what you did' The Judge went on: 'It was a form of torture. It is difficult to understand why anyone could do such a thing to a defenceless 15 month old baby in his cot'. The court was told that Weatherall was acquainted with the baby’s family and carried out the sick acts whilst he was alone with the child in December, last year. It was revealed that Weatherall had been using cannabis at the time of the offences. Wendy Cottee, prosecuting, said that the child’s mother had, out of curiosity, put on a DVD which she did not recognize . 'What she saw horrified her,' said Ms Cottee. The . film seen by the court depicted the child crying and screaming in fear . as it was repeatedly slapped and poked in the face and had a ball thrown . at its head again and again. Ms Cottee said that Weatherall would also pick up the baby by one of its legs and drop it. 'It’s a very disturbing case’ she said, adding: 'It appears to be gratuitous violence,' The . court was told that Weatherall would record his actions either on a . mobile or a web cam before downloading the material on to a disc - which . led to him being discovered. Judge Critchlow told the defendant: 'People would also be appalled that you should film this these acts of violence.'

The surgery that allowed Mark Cahill to once again use his hand was hailed as a landmark moment in British healthcare. But since being given a new lease after Britain's first ever hand transplant, a simple thought has been crossing the 51-year-old's mind - where his new hand came from. The former pub landlord will never know who donated the limb for data protection reasons but as he recovers in Leeds Royal Infirmary he said he 'appreciates the gift he has given me'. Scroll down for video . Life changing: Mark Cahill, pictured with wife Sylvia, underwent the first hand transplant on Boxing Day . Revealing that he and wife Sylvia are . receiving counselling to ensure they don't reject the hand, Mr Cahill . said: 'Obviously the thought goes through your mind who the donor is. 'You think about what the hand has done, where it has been.' Mr Cahill, from Greetland, West . Yorkshire, lost the use of his right hand – and some from his left – . when it became infected during a severe attack of gout, a condition he . had suffered for 20 years. He said that every morning his first thought is now 'there's my new hand', describing the feeling as 'such a novelty'. In an interview with The Sun, Mr . Cahill described his emotional farewell to his hand, saying 'goodbye' to . it before the landmark operation. He described being 'ecstatic' following the eight-hour procedure as he caught a glimpse of his new . fingers, even being able to move them slightly. Immediate success: Mr Cahill, pictured with Sylvia and surgeon Simon Kay,said he wonders who his new hand came from but will never know for data protection reasons . Mr Cahill revealed that he will have . to take 'anti-rejection drugs' for the rest of his life to ensure that . his body accepts the new hand. He also had to undertake psychological evaluations and IQ tests before and after the operation. One of the things he is most looking . forward to is being able to once again shake people's hand, describing . previous scenarios as 'embarrassing'. Following the operation, Mr Cahill said that his next . milestone was to be able to hold his three-year-old grandson’s hand for . the first time. After losing the use of his right hand five years ago, he said the implications . of his surgery were still sinking in. As he continued to marvel at being . able to wiggle the fingers of his new hand, he said he hoped to regain . his independence and enjoy family life to the full. Speaking of his grandson Thomas, he said: ‘Anything I can do will be a bonus. Holding his hand is going to be great.’ ‘I had to go into hospital to cut the infection out and it left me with a paralysed hand,’ he said. He and Sylvia, 47, had to . leave their beloved village pub, the Shears Inn near Halifax, and he has . been unable to work since. ‘It made it virtually impossible to do . anything,’ he said. ‘My wife had to help me dress and cut my food up. You can imagine without any hands it’s very difficult. And Sylvia spoke of looking forward to holding her husband's hand for the first time in five years. She admitted it will be strange holding a stranger's hand but is still excited. A friend said how so far, . for all of Thomas’s life, Mr Cahill has had to settle for ‘just . observing’ the little boy, rather than be able to play with him. ‘He’s . the apple of his eye,’ the friend added. Mr Cahill’s operation . became a world first when his original hand was removed in the same . procedure. While there have been 70 hand transplants world-wide, in . those cases recipients had already lost the limb before the surgery. The surgeon who carried out the . transplant previously praised the donor’s family for bringing about good . from the ‘awful tragedy of a loved one’. Professor Simon Kay, who led the . complex procedure at Leeds General Infirmary, said their permission had . to be sought soon after their relative’s sudden death on Boxing Day. There is no tick box for ‘limbs’ on donor register forms so next-of-kin must be consulted ‘individually by the hospital’. The plastic surgeon said: ‘I really . think we have to acknowledge the circumstances that this hand was given, . at Boxing Day, at a time of enormous tragedy and loss. I would like to . acknowledge the extraordinary gift. ‘Organ donation of any kind plucks something positive from that awful tragedy of a loss of a loved one.’ It is not known what tragedy befell the donor but sources say it was most likely to have been a car crash or a stroke. Professor Kay said it could . be 18 months before the operation is considered a success. ‘If all goes . well, I would hope he has quite strong grasp, and have good sensibility, . a good ability to feel, and he’ll have a precision pinch,’ he said.

The best way to attract new followers on Twitter is to tweet positive messages, write clearly and re-tweet interesting bits of news, a new study claims. With the success of a Twitter account measured by the number of followers it has managed to attract, insights into how to snare a bigger audience are keenly followed by the Twitterati. Previous research had suggested that following, and being followed by, influential users like celebrities and the frequency and timing of tweets were the key to growing a following on the site. Stay positive: A new study claims that Twitter users who had more positive tweets gained more followers than those whose tweets were downbeat . But it appears from the latest study that it is the content of tweets that has the most important effect. Researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta studied half a million tweets by more than 500 Twitter users over 15 months. They gauged whether posts were positive or negative by looking for 2,800 emotive terms, including common acronyms, like LOL, emoticons and slang and swear words. Giving each term a score on a scale of positivity, they then assessed whether the Twitter users who used each term shrank or grew their numbers of followers. Findings showed that the Twitter users who posted the most cheerful messages, whose tweets were the most easily readable and who re-tweeted news gained the most followers. Twitter executives have vowed the introduction of a new advertising model will not lead to users seeing more adverts on the website - yet. Twitter users already sometimes see paid-for tweets among the posts from people, organisations and companies they have chosen to follow. But the microblogging site's new Ads API (application programming interface) will let advertisers better tailor their campaigns to relevant members of Twitter's 200million active users. Facebook launched similar technology in 2010, helping the social network to boost its revenues to more than $3billion the following year. As speculation grows that Twitter will follow Facebook with a stock market float, it seems the company's executives likewise hope to unlock their sites moneymaking potential. Twitter product manager April Underwood told the Financial Times there would be 'no direct impact on the user experience', merely that the service's users should see 'more relevant and better ads'. She did not rule out an increase in the number of ads shown, but insisted the company took users' experience 'really seriously'. Those egotistical Twitter users who liked to tell the world and its dog about their travails on the morning commute tended to not be so popular. Lead researcher C.J. Hutto told New Scientist: 'Twitter is used quite heavily as a news medium. 'My weak connections on Twitter care less about what I had for breakfast than they do about this neat bit of news I discovered.' Another key factor in growing a following on the microblogging site was how well users engaged with their followers. Mr Hutto told New Scientist how users who mentioned followers and replied and favourited their tweets had 'positive follower growth'. On the other hand, those who merely pronounced to nobody in particular suffered from 'dramatically suppressed growth rates,' he added. To assess the clearness of tweeters' messages, Mr Hutto and his colleagues put together a 'Tweet Reading Difficulty Index'. They found that users whose tweets scored better on their index also grew their number of followers. 'When deciding whether or not to follow a virtual stranger, we found Twitter users seek out well-written over poorly written content,' Mr Hutto said. 'People rely on linguistic cues like spelling and vocabulary to compensate for the lack of traditional contextual cues available in face-to-face settings.' The study is available to download for free and the researchers will present their findings at the Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems in Paris in April.","Success of Twitter accounts is gauged by their number of followers .

However, a source at the airport told . Buzzfeed that the director was not detained at all and that Michael . Moore, the Palestinian director and his Israeli co-director are all talking . 'baloney'. The source added that they thought it was 'a publicity stunt for the movie'. Spotlight: Palestinian filmmaker Emad Burnat (left) and movie partner Guy Davidi (right) from Israell at the Oscars luncheon in LA on February 4. Burnat was detailed by immigration on his way to the awards because they did not believe he was nominated . Outrage: Director Michael Moore, a supporter of Mr Burnat, expressed his disgust on Twitter at his friend's treatment on entering the U.S. The director had brought his family to . Los Angeles for Sunday's Oscars but said he was questioned for an over an hour. Documentary maker Michael . Moore said that he helped clear up the matter by calling Oscars' officials on Burnat's behalf. Burnat had been in the United States two weeks earlier doing interviews about the film alongside his co-director, Israeli activist Guy Davidi. Mr Davidi said he believed Mr Burnat's family had been detained because Mrs Burnat was wearing a hijab. Fury: Michael Moore spoke publicly about the treatment that Mr Burnat had received while trying to enter the U.S. on his way to Sunday's Oscars . However, the airport source said that Mr Burnat was simply unable to produce his Oscars ticket straightaway so he was only taken to an inspection area while he located it. The source said the whole incident only took 25 minutes and that Mr Burnat was not racially profiled. Moore insists that Buzzfeed 'have been played' by their source because tickets for the Oscars were not released until Thursday, so he could not have produced it on Tuesday to convince officials to let him through. The Academy did not respond to a request for comment on Burnat's detainment. World-class talent: A still from Emad Burnat's Oscar-nominated 5 Broken Cameras which has already won at Sundance . Upsetting: Mr Burnat's son Gibreel, aged eight, who inspired his father's Oscar-nominated film, was also held by immigration . 5 Broken Cameras, the first Palestinian documentary ever nominated for an Oscar, already has won awards at the Sundance Film Festival and the Cinema Eye Honors. It features footage that the olive farmer-turned-filmmaker shot using five cameras in his occupied West Bank village of Bil'in, from everyday activities with his family to protests and shootings. The son with whom he is traveling, Gibreel, was the inspiration for buying the first of these cameras in 2005; like so many parents, Burnat wanted to document the boy's first steps and smiles. However he also found himself wanting to capture the tension and fighting that are daily occurrences in the struggle for territory. In the film, his cameras keep getting destroyed in the violence. Burnat said in a statement on Wednesday that he is used to the kind of questioning he and his family underwent. Mr Burnat said: 'There are more than 500 Israeli checkpoints, roadblocks, and other barriers to movement across our land, and not a single one of us has been spared the experience that my family and I experienced yesterday.

Virginia Gilks, from Kimbolton, Cambridgeshire, is head of Bromham Lower School in Bedford which is divided into two separate sites. It used to take her 10 minutes to walk in high heels from one to the other until she saw the children zooming between the two on their scooters. The 55 year-old decided to copy them by getting her own £50 silver model and now saves around 15 minutes a day, giving her more time for her job. Virginia Gilks has been using a scooter to travel between the two separate sites of her school, saving her 15 minutes a day . The headmistress said that by investing in the £50 scooter she is hoping to encourage the school's children to become more active . Virginia, who has been riding the scooter - complete with L plates - since Christmas, said: 'It's just a speedier way of going between the sites. 'The school is divided up into two sites - one for the early years and year one and the other site across a large field for years two, three and four. 'For years I've have been watching the children zooming back and forth on their scooters and I've always said I should get one of those.

'I could take my car but actually it is no faster than walking and this way a 10 minute journey takes three minutes. 'If I could have afforded one I would have bought a segway but a scooter has certainly raised eyebrows.' The headmistress thinks that while it is amusing, parents have had a very positive response. She said: 'One parent saw me on the scooter and said ""my mother taught me if I can't say anything nice don't say anything at all"" which I found funny. 'The parents have generally seen the funny side of it - I make sure that I have a laugh at it first before they have chance to poke fun.' Virginia has been at the school since 2008 argued that using the scooter means she has more time for the pupils of the school. She added: 'When you add up all the time I'm saving I'm saving the school precious and valuable time as well as money. 'School budgets are being squeezed, there is no doubt about it. 'I'd say on average I'm saving at least 15 minutes a day and if you add that up over the week it's a lot of time.'

Dallas Fire Rescue spokesman Jason Evans says as many as five extension ladders at a time were used to remove the passengers from the ride above the Giants of the Savanna exhibit. The train was around 20 feet off the ground when it stopped and the 93 people were trapped for about 40 minutes before being rescued one-by-one. A similar incident happened at the zoo in 2011. Salvation: Around 100 people were rescued by firefighters after the monorail ride malfunctioned at Dallas Zoo . 'Opportune': While the ride stopped 20 feet above the ground, it wasn't directly above any animal habitats . Fortunately, the monorail didn't get stuck above any animal habitats. 'It stopped a very opportune place because it was such a low point there, very accessible,' Sean Greene, Dallas Zoo Vice President of Guest Services told NBC. 'It didn't impede any animals, didn't impede the experience over the elephants. But obviously for those 93 passengers they would like to have completed their journey.' Evans says firefighters responded to a 911 call about 3:30 pm after what is thought to be an electrical problem caused the train to stall. He says the 30-minute rescue was made easier because firefighters had easy access to the passengers. All 93 people were refunded for the ride. Malfunction: The 93 passengers were stuck for around 40 minutes . Stuck: Firefighters used up to five extension ladders at a time . Fox News reports that the monorail also suffered an electrical fault around 18 months ago. In September 2011 a breaker shorted out, trapping 30 passengers for an hour. The zoo is not yet sure if the problem on this occasion was in the same car. The attraction was shut down on Sunday as engineers worked out what caused the malfunction. Jerry Davis, one of the people rescued, told NBC: 'Actually [this was] my wife's first time on the monorail. I've been on it once before and this was definitely a first.' The zoo's website says the monorail is the only one in the U.S. that can 'climb and turn, taking guests on a one-mile tour through bush, desert, forest, woodland, river and mountain environments.'

Spider-Man's webbing really could stop a train if it recreated what exists in nature, research has shown. In the film Spider-Man 2, the superhero shoots strands of the material at surrounding buildings to prevent a runaway train plummeting to disaster. The scene seems far fetched even by Hollywood standards, but not according to a group of young British scientists investigating the amazing properties of spider's silk. In Spiderman 2, Peter Parker used his spider's web to stop a train. Researchers now say a spider has been found that actually has silk strong enough to so this . The spider, from Madagascar creates orb-shaped webs tougher than any other known and more than 10 times stronger than Kevlar. Juvenile males also weave spider webs, but once they become adults, they abandon this behaviour and instead direct their energies solely to sex. For survival, the Darwin's bark spider relies in part on its mottled, jagged appearance, which camouflages the spider against trees and-along with Charles Darwin-inspired its name. An analysis of the Darwin's bark spider's silk indicates it's the toughest biological material discovered to date. They calculated that, scaled up to Spider-Man proportions, it would be strong enough to halt a four-car New York subway train travelling at full speed. The three University of Leicester physics students worked out the force needed to overcome the train's momentum - an enormous 300,000 Newtons. To avoid breaking, every cubic metre of Spider-Man's web would have to soak up almost 500 million joules of energy. Incredibly, they found one spider spins silk that is up to the job. Darwin's bark spider, from Madagascar, creates orb-shaped webs tougher than any other known and more than 10 times stronger than Kevlar. One of the young scientists, Alex Stone, 21, from Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, said: 'It is often quoted that spider webs are stronger than steel, so we thought it would be interesting to see whether this held true for Spider-Man's scaled up version. 'Considering the subject matter, we were surprised to find out that the webbing was portrayed accurately.' The Darwin's bark spider, from Madagascar, creates orb-shaped webs tougher than any other known and more than 10 times stronger than Kevlar . The research is published today in the latest issue of the University of Leicester's Journal of Physics Special Topics. Each year the journal features original short papers written by Master of Physics degree students.Co-author James Forster, 22, from Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, said: 'While our work may not seem to be very serious it has helped teach us about applying physics to varying situations as well as the peer review process through which scientific journals operate. 'This makes it an invaluable experience to anyone who wants to go into research later in life.' Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker in the film based on the Marvel comic book character: Researchers now say that spider silk is strong enough to stop a train - if enough is used . Course leader Dr Mervyn Roy, a lecturer in the Department of Physics and Astronomy, said: 'A lot of the papers published in the journal are on subjects that are amusing, topical or a bit off-the-wall. 'Our fourth years are nothing if not creative. 'But, to be a research physicist - in industry or academia - you need to show some imagination, to think outside the box, and this is certainly something that the module allows our students to practice.'","Young scientists calculated exactly how strong spider silk would be if used in large quantities .

When Goudschall moved out of their . family home in 2008, she moved the two girls, now aged 10 and 8, . to Texas and limited Frazier's visits. In a bid to maintain contact with her non-biological daughters Frazier filed a legal action to enforce a . co-parenting agreement the two women had signed promising 'jointly and equally share parental . responsibility'. Complications of modern parenting: Julianne Moore and Annette Bening play a lesbian couple who face tensions over the fact that only one of them is the biological mother to their children in The Kids Are All Right . Goudschaal argued not to maintain the agreement, saying that she was the only one with the legal status of parent and appealing . Frazier's right to joint custody. Goudschall's argument was that the courts did not . have authority to address custody issues unless they were presented 'in a divorce action involving two . married persons, who would necessarily have to be a man and a woman' in Kansas. However, the court agreed with Frazier that the children's best interests outweighed the need to 'strictly adhere to the biological connection', allowing her joint custody. The court said not enforcing the parenting agreement would deny the children the opportunity to have two parents. Cathy Sakimura, Family Law Director for the National Center for Lesbian Rights, said: 'The Kansas Supreme Court recognised that children with same-sex parents have the same need for stability as children in any other family,' With this ruling, Kansas joins a number of other states in deciding that when two people raise a child together, the law should treat them both as the child’s parents.","It was a ground-breaking custody case for non-biological parents .

Barack Obama has read the riot act to the leaders of several European countries - saying more dramatic action is needed to avert a eurozone meltdown. The U.S. President made telephone calls to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Italian President Giorgio Napolitano late last night. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said the president had demanded faster action from Europe. It came as Hong Kong revealed it had plunged into recession. Speaking from the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation conference, Geithner said: 'The crisis in Europe remains the central challenge to global growth. 'It is crucial that Europe move quickly to put in place a strong plan to restore financial stability.' He said all of the 21 APEC countries were directly affected by the Eurozone crisis, and encouraged them to take steps to 'strengthen growth in the face of these pressures from Europe'. And he revealed that Obama was looking to hitch the U.S. economy to growth opportunities in Asia, where he is embarking on an eight day tour, that he hoped would help power the recovery he needs for re-election. Developments in Europe saw U.S. stocks rise yesterday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 1 per cent at 11893.79, and the Nasdaq Composite tacked on 0.1 per cent to 2625.13. The warning to Europe comes as Italy's Senate today votes, after months of dithering and delay, on austerity measures demanded by the EU. The Italian upper house is due to vote on a package of cuts. The law should pass easily, as it should in the lower house on Saturday. Midnight chat: German chancellor Angela Merkel (left) and French President Nicolas Sarkozy (right) received calls from the U.S. President last night . Voting for the first time in the upper house will be Mario Monti, the former European Commissioner who has emerged as favourite to replace Silvio Berlusconi as prime minister. Greece: . Appointed Lucas Papademos as new Prime Minister, who hopes to secure . 130bn euro debt deal from the eurozone to keep the country in the single . currency. Italy: . PM Silvio Berlusconi has promised to quit once economic reforms have . been passed, possibly as early on Sunday. Likely to be replaced by . former European Commissioner Mario Monti. Fears . Italy would have to be bailed out after interest on its 10-year bonds . rose past critical 7 per cent figure which saw Ireland, Portugal and . Greece default. Resignation of Berlusconi has calmed the waters, and yields are now down to 6.8 per cent. Britain: Government making contingency plans for if the euro collapses. Worried that it will drag the UK into a double-dip recession. Berlusconi, who lost his majority in a vote on Tuesday, has promised to resign after the financial stability law is passed by both houses of parliament. If the votes pass smoothly, Napolitano may accept Berlusconi's resignation as early as Saturday night and formally mandate Monti to try to form a new government soon afterwards. At first, Berlusconi had insisted that early elections were the only option. But he has since softened his stand and is said by sources to be open to a new government. Markets were calmed at the prospect of an interim government, rather than a three-month vacuum before elections are held. Monti, a highly respected international figure, has been pushed for weeks as the most suitable figure to lead a national unity government to push through painful austerity measures. It also comes as Greece's prime minister designate was set to name a new crisis cabinet today to calm the political turmoil that has threatened to bankrupt the country and force it out of the euro zone. Greece's two main parties agreed yesterday to make Lucas Papademos head of a new unity government. It ended a chaotic search for a leader to save the country from default. He must now fulfill the terms of a 130 billion euro bailout plan agreed with European partners in October. Papademos said: 'The path will not be easy but I am convinced the problems will be resolved faster and at a smaller cost if there is unity, understanding and prudence.' Sources in the two parties - the ruling Socialists and the opposition New Democracy - said Evangelos Venizelos was likely to remain as finance minister when President Karolos Papoulias swears in the new cabinet, scheduled for 12noon GMT. The weak global economy has today pushed Hong Kong into a recession with GDP figures showing a third-quarter contraction, the second straight quarterly decline. The Hong Kong government said exports dropped off sharply towards the end of the quarter 'amid an increasingly austere global economic environment'. The economy grew 4.3 per cent in the third quarter, smaller than the revised 5.1 per cent growth in the second quarter, which was itself less than the 7.5 per cent expansion notched up in the first quarter. Some economists define a recession as two straight quarters of economic contraction while others say it is a significant decline in across-the-board economic activity lasting more than a year.","U.S. Treasury Secretary: 'The crisis in Europe remains the central challenge to global growth'

The impressionist's 1932 piece, Femme Assise Pres d'une Fenetre (Woman Sitting Near a Window) of his companion Marie-Therese Walter was the first of a series of sales held in London this month by Sotheby's, Christie's and smaller auction houses. Prices for the most sought-after works have soared in recent years despite broader economic concerns, with collectors in China, Russia and the Middle East joining more established patrons in Europe and the United States. Picasso's Femme Assise Pres d'une Fenetre (Woman Sitting Near a Window) sold for £28,601,250 at Sotheby's, London . What recession? Prices for the most sought-after works have soared in recent years despite broader economic concerns . Subtracting the buyer's premium of more than 10 percent, the amount realised for the 1932 Picasso was at the lower end of pre-sale estimates of £25million to £35million. Helena Newman, from Sotheby's, said: ‘We are delighted that this stunning and monumental portrait, which is part of the defining series that introduced his “golden muse” to the public eye, fetched such a strong price. ‘In recent years in particular we have witnessed the remarkable allure of Picasso's portraits of Marie-Therese to collectors, with La Lecture selling for £25 million - double its pre-sale estimate - in Sotheby's February 2011 sale, and Nature Morte aux Tulipes selling in Sotheby's November 2012 sale for 41.5m US dollars (£26.5m).

Schiele's 1914 piece, Lovers (Self Portrait With Wally) fetched £7.9million, an auction record for the artist for a work on paper. Also sold by the Leopold Museum in Vienna was his Self Portrait in Green Shirt with Eyes Closed, which sold for £5.1million, well above expectations of between £1.8million and £2.5million. The combined tally for Schiele works, sold by the museum to help settle a long-running restitution case involving art deemed to have been stolen by the Nazis in the 1930s, was 14 million pounds. Other lots fared less well, notably Max Beckmann's Before the Ball - Two Women With a Cat which went unsold despite pre-sale estimates of £5million to £8million. Overall the evening brought in £121.1million in sales, within expectations of £103million to £149million. Sotheby's said it was their second highest total from an equivalent sale in London. Helena Newman, chair of Sotheby's impressionist and modern art in Europe said: ‘Bidders, both new to the market as well as seasoned buyers, reacted with great enthusiasm, in particular to the selection of impressionist works that were considered to be the strongest offering in many years.","Woman Sitting Near a Window sold at Sotheby's yesterday .

Caroline Banana, 40, allegedly failed to tell authorities about her win on the television gameshow and continued to claim £5,000 in state handouts. By law, benefit claimants must tell the Department for Work  and Pensions if, through windfall  or inheritance, they come into enough money to push their bank balance over £16,000. Scroll down for video . In the hot seat: Banana is accused of failing to tell authorities about her winnings from Channel 4's show Deal or No Deal . Banana, who was born in Zimbabwe, is now due to appear in front of magistrates later this month. She has offered to repay  the money, but council officials have continued with the prosecution regardless. Banana won the cash on the Channel 4 . programme just over  a year ago, telling viewers she would use her good . fortune to  buy her own home and help her family in Africa. After her win, the mother of two, . from Stoke-on-Trent, hugged host Noel Edmonds and posed for pictures . with him and her husband Michael, 48. Banana, pictured with Noel Edmonds after making her deal, will appear in court later this month . Banana was offered £95,000 by the show's Banker in return for her unopened box - which was worth only £75,000 . On the show, each contestant is assigned a numbered box which contains a cash value unknown to them or the audience. During the game, they reject the . other sealed boxes, which contain amounts ranging from 1p to £250,000, . one by one, hoping not to lose the higher value sums. The show’s mysterious ‘banker’ regularly tries to tempt the contestant to ‘deal’ by making offers to . buy their box depending on which sums remain in the game. Caroline Banana struck lucky on Deal Or No Deal but now faces prosecution by Stoke-on-Trent City Council over alleged overpayment of benefits . Banana’s box originally contained £250,000 but she accepted a swap that left her with a box containing just £5,000. After initially rejecting a £35,000 offer from the banker, she then sold it to him for £95,000. She said at the time: ‘I felt a  bit nervous [appearing on the show] as it was the moment I was waiting for. ‘When I was walking on stage I could feel myself trembling but when I stood next to Noel I calmed down a little bit. ‘I was thinking that I was not a lucky person but something made me carry on.’ A statement on the show’s website . said the win meant ‘Caroline can buy a home, allow Michael  to finish . his degree and help her family back in Africa’. Just 14 months after her . television appearance, however, Stoke-on-Trent  City Council accused . her of being a benefit cheat. A council worker said: ‘She has offered to repay the money but we still intend to prosecute her on fraud charges.’ It is alleged Banana was overpaid £5,000 in benefits, including housing and council tax benefit, between November 2011 and 2012. Before the summons had been served to . her, Banana wrote on her Facebook  page: ‘I am not aware  of any court . case. I just know that  I agreed to pay [back] overpayments from the . council and set up a direct debit.’ She is due to appear at North Staffordshire Justice Centre on February 20.

Holding her new puppy in her arms, Teresa Walton popped into the local dog grooming parlour to ask about the cost of keeping him in tip-top shape. But moments after she arrived at the shop, her beloved pet was dead – savaged by the parlour owner’s two vicious dogs which had been allowed to roam free. As a frantic Mrs Walton threw herself over the pup she called ‘my baby’, parlour owner Karen Creasey tried desperately to pull her two dogs away. Teresa Walton's cockapoo puppy Cooper was only 13 weeks old when he died after a bull mastiff attack . Devastated owner Teresa Walton showed pictures of Cooper as she described the horror of the attack . But the women were no match for the snarling attackers and the 13-week-old cockapoo pup Cooper had no chance. Last night Mrs Walton, 46, and her . husband Terry, 52, spoke of their horror at losing their pet and their . fears that it could have been so much worse. ‘We are never going to be able to . replace him but we will fight for justice for Cooper,’ Mr Walton said. ‘It could so easily have been a woman carrying a baby.’ Mrs Creasey, who was appalled at the . attack, said she had since closed her business, K9 Cutz, and planned to . have her dogs, thought to be bull mastiffs, destroyed. The Waltons had bought Cooper – a . cross between a cocker spaniel and a poodle – in December. Their . 23-year-old son had left home and their previous dog had died. It was . the perfect time to welcome a new pup. Wanting to spoil her new pet, Mrs . Walton walked to K9 Cutz  in Weston, Lincolnshire, to ask about the cost . of their treatments. She knocked on the door but when it opened the two . mastiffs ran out and savaged Cooper to death. Tragic: 13-week-old puppy Cooper was mauled to death by two bull mastiff dogs when taken to a grooming parlour . Mrs Walton then called the police, while desperately trying to keep the dogs from tearing Cooper’s body apart. Choking back tears, she said: ‘He was . such a little character. Our son has just left home and Cooper became . our new baby. The woman really tried to get them off but she couldn’t . control them. ‘She was calling the dogs off and then she laid over Cooper and I went down on to the floor with his head tucked under my arm. ‘I didn’t want them to eat him. The . dogs were still circling and sniffing around. I have hardly slept since . because as soon as I fall asleep I relive it all.’ Mrs Walton, who now has her arm in a . sling after hurting it as she wrestled with the dogs, phoned her . husband, who rushed to the shop. The Waltons took the body of Cooper, a cross between a cocker spaniel and a poodle, home in a blanket and buried him in their back garden after the attack by the mastiffs, similar to that pictured left . ‘I saw Teresa carrying Cooper and I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. He was a mess,’ he said. ‘We took him home wrapped in his blanket and buried him in the back garden.’ Mrs Creasey, 43, who has run the parlour for six years, said she was ‘distraught and devastated’ at the attack. She claimed she allowed the mastiffs . to run free indoors because the shop had closed for the day but Mrs . Walton insists it was still open. A sign outside warned visitors that the dogs might be off  their leashes. Sobbing, she said: ‘I was physically . kicking them and hitting them and trying to get them off her dog. I laid . down on her dog to stop them attacking it, but there was nothing I . could do. ‘I am distraught by what happened.

Probes: Prime Minister David Cameron has ordered further investigations into the standards of care at several trusts . More than 3,000 patients have died ‘unexpectedly’ in just five NHS trusts in the past two years. The five are among nearly 20 hospitals facing inspections over concerns that thousands of patients are dying needlessly, it was revealed last night. David Cameron has ordered an investigation into standards of care at trusts where death rates are persistently high. In addition, he outlined plans for performance-related pay for doctors, nurses and managers based on their level of care. He made the announcements on the day the author of the report into one of the Stafford hospital scandals warned a similar outrage could happen again. The five hospitals which will be inspected are Basildon and Thurrock, Colchester, Tameside, Blackpool and East Lancashire, where death rates have been persistently high over the past two years. Officials would not confirm which other hospitals face inspections, but over the past year a total of 20 trusts have been found to have high death rates. They include Wye Valley, Aintree University Hospitals, Mid Cheshire Hospitals, Northern Lincolnshire and Goole and Hull and East Yorkshire. Mr Cameron told the Commons: ‘I have asked the NHS medical director, Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, to conduct an immediate investigation into the care of hospitals with the highest mortality rates, and to check that urgent remedial action is being taken. 'The way Robert Francis (the report’s author) chronicles the evidence of systemic failure means we cannot say with confidence that failings of care are limited to one hospital.’ At risk: Ministers believe thousands of patients could be at risk because examples of poor care reminiscent of that at Stafford Hospital (pictured) and Cannock Chase Hospital are 'dotted around' the NHS . Damning: Inquiry Chairman Robert Francis QC published his 1,700 page report with 290 recommendations following 'appalling care' at a Stafford hospital . Mr Cameron also took the unprecedented . step of apologising to the families of patients who suffered ‘horrific . abuse’ at the trust. Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust .

Observed deaths: 3,864Expected deaths: 3,356Difference: 507 . Tameside Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. Observed deaths: 2,883Expected deaths: 2,423Difference: 459 . He said: ‘This public inquiry not only . repeats earlier findings but also shows wider systemic failings . . . so I would like to go further as Prime Minister and apologise to the . families of all those who have suffered for the way that the system . allowed such horrific abuse to go unchecked and unchallenged for so . long. ‘On behalf of the Government – and indeed our country – I am truly sorry.’ Mr Cameron announced that hospital . chief executives and chairmen could be sacked if patients say their . trust’s care is poor. At present, senior managers are usually sacked . only if their trust gets into debt or if they miss targets. The Prime Minister also confirmed that . healthcare assistants – untrained nurses – would be subject to new . minimum standards and better training. This autumn, he will appoint a . chief inspector of hospitals who will be responsible for checking they . are clean, safe and caring, in the same way as schools inspectors check . educational standards. Mr Cameron said: ‘We need a hospital . inspection regime that doesn’t just look at numeric targets, but makes a . judgment about the quality of care.’ In addition, Mr Cameron has appointed . MP Ann Clwyd – whose husband suffered appalling care – to investigate . the NHS’s complaints system. Mr Francis said the Mid Staffordshire . scandal was not an ‘event of such rarity or improbability’, and he could . not ‘assume that it has not been and will not be repeated’. Under investigation: Tameside Hospital is one of almost 20 hospitals to be investigated over persistently high death rates . Debate: David Cameron spoke in the House of Commons about the public inquiry into failings at Stafford Hospital . Christine Green, chief executive of . Tameside Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, said she looked forward to . receiving Sir Bruce’s team, adding it was ‘well recognised’ that the . trust’s death rate had been elevated for the past two years. Miss Green said: ‘Over recent years . the hospital has undertaken an extensive quality improvement programme, . which has seen significant quality gains across a wide range of other . clinical indicators including hospital infections, falls, deep vein . thrombosis screening and pressure ulcers.’ A spokesman for Basildon and Thurrock . University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said they were committed to . improving mortality rates, with all hospital deaths reviewed to identify . any lessons that can be learned. Hell: 'Cure The NHS' campaigner Julie Bailey in front of a memorial wall set up at Brakes Cafe in Stafford with the faces of many who died in the town's hospital . Doctors, nurses and NHS managers should face jail for failing to tell the truth, the report states. It calls for new honesty rules to ensure staff don’t try to cover up their mistakes, as routinely happened at Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust. Robert Francis QC also wants failed . managers to be ‘blacklisted’ to prevent them being rehired at other . hospitals and nurses to face annual ‘compassion’ checks. Tougher regulations: Robert Francis QC recommended that hospital staff face jail if they attempt to cover up mistakes . In total, he set out 290 recommendations to ‘change the culture’ of the NHS to ensure the mistakes of Mid Staffordshire could not happen again. The measures include appointing a dedicated ‘older people’s’ nurse at hospitals and banning the practice of patients being discharged at night. He also calls for future nurses to undergo personality checks before being enrolled on courses, to ensure they were capable of caring for patients. The report also demands a ban on gagging clauses, under which NHS staff are bribed with tens of thousands of pounds to stop them speaking out about poor care. The Care Quality Commission would also carry out ‘honesty checks’ during routine inspections of hospitals. Officials would ask patients and relatives if they felt staff were being open with them, and trusts or wards would be given a score. If staff were found to be covering up their mistakes they could face prosecution. Nurses who worked at Mid Staffordshire have revealed how they were threatened with physical violence for raising their concerns. One, Helene Donnelly, 34, told the inquiry how she was afraid to go to her car at night in case she was attacked by another staff member. Giving evidence in 2011, she spoke of two senior nurses, the ward sisters, who ruled the A&E unit with fear: ‘The staff were scared of the sisters and afraid to speak out about the poor standards of care patients were receiving.’ Last night Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he was looking ‘very sympathetically’ at the call for criminal sanctions for NHS workers who covered up bad care.","David Cameron has ordered an investigation into standards of care at trusts where death rates are persistently high .

Sixth victim: Duwayne Philpott, 13, died in hospital after his parents made the difficult decision to turn his life support machine off . Mr Philpott said: ‘I want to thank my three eldest children because they have helped us cope. And then there’s a young lad who tried to get in the house the same as myself. ‘Then of course there is the four firemen, the police, the ambulances, the doctors and nurses – everybody who tried to help save our children. ‘We can’t express our gratitude enough. It’s not just us that have suffered, it’s them as well – it’s everybody.’ Mr Philpott said that his son Duwayne’s organs had been donated to save the life of another child. ‘That makes us happy and it takes a bit of the pain away,’ he added. ‘We grew up in a community that’s been through a lot of problems with violence and to see this community come together like it has, it’s too overwhelming.

Accident: Three men jumped clear of the lifeboat but five others became trapped and died . Last night Thomson Cruises said it . was investigating the accident aboard the Thomson Majesty, which only . made its first sailing for the firm last summer. The luxury ship, which carries 1,462 . passengers and has 17 spa rooms, two swimming pools and five . restaurants, had arrived at Santa Cruz on the island of La Palma three . hours earlier for a six-hour stop en route to Madeira. At just before midday, with many . passengers on shore enjoying carnival celebrations, the crew began to . lower the lifeboat as part of a drill that was made compulsory for . cruise liners at every stop following the Costa Concordia tragedy. Upturned: A lifeboat remains in the sea after falling from a cruise liner called 'Valleta' and killing five people during a safety drill while it was docked at La Palma in the Canary Islands . Close-up: Four people are believed to have died before they could be rescued and a fifth man passed away later . Aftermath: A rescue boat is moored by the capsized lifeboat following the tragedy . Tragic incident: A rescue helicopter is seen next to the Thomson Majesty cruise ship at the Santa Cruz pier . Witnesses said that during the . safety exercise, one of the lifeboat hoist cables snapped, briefly . causing the boat to hang vertically with the eight crew on board. Seconds later, the other cable snapped under the strain, sending the boat plummeting six decks towards the water. The survivors, two aged 30 and one . aged 32, managed to jump away before it hit the water. Two Greek men are said to be seriously injured and are being treated at a local . hospital. The third, a Filipino, has been discharged. The others were trapped as they . entered the water. Four of them were dead by the time their bodies were . recovered, while the other crewman died a short time later. Last night, the small, white, . two-hulled lifeboat could be seen capsized beside the ship. The Foreign . Office said it was ‘urgently investigating’ the incident. Rescue workers: The five people killed were crew of the Thompson Majesty, operated by Thomson Cruises . Concern: The local harbourmaster said the early indications were that the lifeboat had plunged into the water after a mechanical failure . Location: The Thomson Majesty liner had arrived in the port of the island of La Palma (pictured) just three hours earlier from Gran Canaria for a six-hour stopover en route to Funchal, Madeira . Last night a former passenger raised doubts about the safety drill. Retired entrepreneur Terry Dobbins, 75, from Bournemouth, was on the ship last week and watched the 'shambolic' safety exercise. He added: 'The lifeboat was coming . half way down, then lurching to a halt. They were bouncing in mid air. The winches were seizing up. It was really worrying. The Thomson Majesty - a nine-deck boat measuring 679ft by 92ft with a speed of 19 knots - has five restaurants, five bars, two lounges, a casino, two swimming pools, a library and fitness centre. It . can carry up to 1,462 passengers along with 600 staff. A . seven-night cruise of the Canary Islands on the boat, leaving in . February or March, costs £600 per person for a two-person cabin online, including return flights from London to Tenerife. 'I'm not sure if I would go back. Our lives are in their hands.' The 40,876-ton Majesty, which has a . crew of 600, sails around the Greek islands in the summer before taking . passengers on winter sun cruises to the Canaries, Madeira, Morocco and . Tenerife. The 20-year-old ship is managed on Thomson’s behalf by a . company called Louis Cruises. It is the second tragedy to strike the . ship since it entered service in 1992. In March 2010, two passengers . were killed when the liner, then called the Louis Majesty, was struck by . a giant wave in the Mediterranean. Last night Thomson said: ‘There was an . incident involving the ship’s crew during a safety drill. Our thoughts . are with the families of those involved. ‘We are working closely with the ship owners and managers, Louis Cruises, to determine exactly what has happened. ‘We are also working closely with all relevant authorities and will be co-operating fully with their investigations.’","Thomson Majesty liner had arrived at La Palma port just three hours earlier .

Police have been granted an extension to continue questioning the parents of six children who died in a horrific house fire. Mick and Mairead Philpott were arrested yesterday on suspicion of their murder and police were allowed to detain them until 10am this morning before applying for extra time. Their arrest came a week after police seized a caravan and minibus parked outside their home for forensic tests. Scroll down for video . Mick and Mairead Philpott, pictured with five of the six children who died in the house fire. The other identities have been obscured for legal reasons . Grief-stricken: Mick and Mairead Philpott, the parents of six children who died following a fire at their home in Derby, appeared at a news conference . The couple had broken down in tears at a . press conference a fortnight ago as police officers described the . attack that claimed the lives of their children. Jade Philpott, ten, and brothers John, nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, six, and Jayden, five, were all killed in the fire. Older brother Duwayne, 13, died of his injuries in hospital a few days later with his parents at his bedside. Mr Philpott had been hailed by neighbours as a hero for ‘valiant’ attempts to rescue his children. Police have established that the fire was deliberate, caused by someone pouring petrol through the letterbox of the family’s three-bedroom council house in Allenton, Derby, before igniting it with a match or a cigarette lighter. Sixth victim: Duwayne Philpott, 13, died in hospital after his life support machine was turned off . While Mr Philpott, 55, and wife Mairead, 31, had previously been questioned as witnesses, officers said they were not ruling anybody out as the potential arsonists. After the parents were arrested yesterday, Derbyshire assistant chief constable Steve Cotterill appealed for the local community to help officers work out why the fire was started. He said: ‘In view of the arrests, I would urge anyone who may have been holding back, not felt comfortable to voice their concerns or not had the confidence, to do so now. ‘It may well be that you have a little bit of loyalty to family  or friends. I would ask you to  put that aside in memory of those six children.’ Mr and Mrs Philpott were arrested yesterday morning in Derby. Police are able to question them until 10am today, but may seek an extension if necessary to interview them further. The couple are believed to have been at home when the fire broke out in the early hours of May 11, but some neighbours have said they were out. Mr and Mrs Philpott have previously insisted they were woken by a smoke alarm and failed to save the children despite ‘valiant’ attempts. The caravan removed by police from outside the property last week is thought to have been used as extra accommodation at the family home, with Mr and Mrs Philpott often sleeping in it. After the arrests yesterday, police increased their presence on the road where the family live. Tributes and gifts left outside the home were also removed. Respect: Well-wishers have left hundreds of cards, flowers, teddy bears and candles after a candlelit vigil . Mr Philpott, a father of 17 children by five women, became known as ‘Shameless Mick’ in 2007 after demanding a larger house for his family. As news of the Philpotts’ arrest spread among neighbours, Anthony Slater of the community group Oscar, which has raised more than £10,000 for the funerals of the children, said he was ‘gobsmacked’. A close family friend and godmother to one of the children said she spoke to Mr Philpott on the telephone after his arrest and ‘he’s not worried’. She added: ‘He says it’s protocol. They always have to do this so they can rule out close family.’ Another friend, priest Father Alan Burbidge, said: ‘This is unbelievable and very, very sad. The community is in total shock over the tragic deaths of six innocent children.’ Search for clues: Police prepare to lift the caravan on to a low-loader outside the burnt-out Philpott family home in Allenton, Derby .

A mother who helped expose one of the worst hospital disasters has been sent grotesque hate messages by an NHS worker. Julie Bailey set up Cure the NHS to campaign for an investigation into Mid Staffordshire NHS trust which later found up to 1,200 patients had died needlessly. The café owner has since received a series of threats from an ambulance worker saying he wished she ‘had a life threatening illness’. Vile remarks: Murph Guest (left) allegedly made the comments about Cure The NHS founder Julie Bailey (right), who has led calls for an inquiry into Mid-Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust . Roy ‘Murph’ Guest, who handles 999 calls for West Midlands Ambulance Service, said ‘she’d done enough damage’. In a string of comments posted on Facebook, he said she was ‘single-handedly to blame’ for Mid Staffordshire’s negative publicity. He added: ‘Julie Bailey, I hope you suffer a life threatening illness at night where you have to travel further [sic] than you should do because your local hospital is closed (your fault). Serves you right, go back to yer bacon butties girl and leave the staff alone.’ Mr Guest, a father of two, is being investigated by the ambulance service but has not been suspended. Astonishing rant: The senior West Midlands Ambulance Service worker said on a Facebook group in support of staff at Stafford Hospital that Miss Bailey, 51, should 'shut her face' and 'go back to her bacon butties' 'Julie Bailey, I hope you suffer a life threatening illness at night where you have to travel further than you should do because your local hospital is closed (your fault)' Murph Guest, West Midlands Ambulance Service senior paramedic . He is thought to work in ambulance control, handling emergency calls, but was previously a paramedic. Yesterday, Mrs Bailey, 51, said: ‘I’ve phoned the police. I don’t know what to do. I’m scared if anything happens to me. If I need an ambulance urgently and he picks up the phone, can I trust this man? I don’t feel safe. I don’t feel I’d be treated fairly. ‘He’s supposed to be a professional. Negative comments like this, from people who don’t understand what we’ve been through, just aren’t helpful. Shocking report: Up to 1,200 patients are feared to have died from neglect at Mid-Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust (Stafford Hospital pictured) from 2005 to 2008 with thousands of others suffering 'inhumane' treatment . 'It has been the same for five years now, it's the same as the threats I have always had hoping that I get some kind of disease. These people need to be rooted out, they are just the kind of bully who works for the NHS' Julie Bailey, Cure The NHS . The mother of two added: ‘It has been the same for five years now, it’s the same as the threats I have always had hoping that I get some kind of disease. ‘These people need to be rooted out, they are just the kind of bully who works for the NHS. ‘I have had a great response from lots of NHS staff, overworked staff have written to me to thank us for our hard work.’ Mr Guest, 54, made the threats even though his mother Irene died at the trust in 2008 having suffered from dementia. His father, Jeff, 82, a member of Cure the NHS, said she was never bathed, not properly fed and was left to lie in soiled sheets. Mr Guest – whose wife Claire, 54, is a nurse at the trust – has since apologised and removed the comments from Facebook. Loss: Miss Bailey started her campaign after her mother Bella (pictured), 86, died in 2007 at the hospital . Murph Guest's real name is Roy and today it emerged his own father is a key member of Miss Bailey's campaign group. Guest's father Jeff, 82, joined Miss Bailey's campaign for greater care for the elderly following the death of his wife Irene, 73, who was treated at Stafford Hospital in 2008. Irene Guest allegedly received appalling care during her five-week stay at the hospital. An early Alzheimer's sufferer, she had been admitted with a suspected water infection, but her condition deteriorated. Mr Guest, a former builder, said his wife was never bathed, was left to lie in soiled sheets, given no proper medication and was not fed adequately. Speaking at the time he claimed: ‘Irene had early Alzheimer's but in my opinion some of the staff did not know how to deal with her. I also noticed they didn't wash their hands between patients.’ Mrs Guest was discharged in February 2008 and transferred to Cannock Chase Hospital in Staffordshire, before going to another care home where she died two weeks later. Speaking outside his semi-detached home in Stafford, he said: ‘I’m a healthcare professional. 'I’ve apologised for my comments on Facebook and I’ve removed the comments.’ A spokesman for the ambulance service said: ‘We are shocked by the comments that have been made on Facebook which have reportedly been made by a member of Trust staff. ‘An investigation has been launched to establish if indeed it is a member of staff that has posted these comments.’ Last week, an inquiry into the failings at Mid Staffordshire – partly triggered by Mrs Bailey – warned that similar neglect may exist in other hospitals. The findings prompted David Cameron to order inspections of 14 trusts with high death rates over concerns that patients are suffering needlessly. Mid Staffordshire trust faces ongoing problems with standards of care and finances and could be shut down. It is currently under investigation by the watchdog Monitor, which will decide on its fate later this year. It has already been forced to close its A&E unit overnight because it was unable to recruit enough staff. Mrs Bailey set up Cure the NHS in an attempt to bring those responsible to justice after witnessing appalling treatment when her mother Bella was admitted to the hospital in 2007. She wrote to the Healthcare Commission and campaigned with other relatives of patients.","Murph Guest 'made comments' about Cure The NHS founder Julie Bailey .

The NHS has spent £4million on sending fat people to Weight Watchers over the past five years.GPs now routinely refer patients to the classes, which cost 'private' visitors around £45 for three months. Recent studies have found the courses to be highly effective at helping people lose weight. GPs have been able to send patients to them on the NHS since 2007, after they were approved by the rationing watchdog NICE. They are offered by two-thirds of Primary Care Trusts. Obese: The NHS has spent £4million on sending fat people to Weight Watchers over the past five years . Now figures obtained by Channel 4  documentary programme Dispatches show that the NHS spent £4million on Weight Watchers between 2007 and 2012 – the equivalent of £800,000 a year. It is estimated that 30,000 are sent on courses paid for by the Health Service each year, as it attempts to overcome the country's obesity crisis. Celebrity slimmer: Patsy Kensit was unveiled as one of Weight Watchers' newest ambassadors, having lost 10lb in 12 weeks following the points system . Nearly a quarter of adults are classified as obese – having a body mass index above 30 – and experts predict this will increase to a half by 2040. Recent research has suggested that Weight Watchers classes are more effective for weight loss than following dietary advice from a doctor. In addition, in December a study conducted by the NHS found that patients lost an average of three pounds more on Weight Watchers than they did after visiting other so-called slimming clubs. The analysis showed that Weight Watchers members were 81 per cent more likely to shed 5 per cent of their weight – an amount judged by experts to make an impact on health – than those who went to rival company Slimming World. The study's authors said the secret of Weight Watchers success may be that people seemed to find its course easier to complete than those of its competitors. Similar work by the Medical Research Council in 2010 found that patients on a Weight Watchers course lost twice as much weight as those who merely sought advice from their GP. Researchers have also said courses give patients good habits for life. However, concerns have been raised that many pro-Weight Watchers studies are funded by the company itself, and may therefore be biased. Claire Friedemann, of the centre of evidence-based medicine at the University of Oxford, told Dispatches: 'The danger with companies funding their own research is that they may only publish results which are positive for them.' After analysing ten studies that suggested Weight Watchers was effective, she found that eight had been paid for by the firm itself. Her analysis also showed that while many Weight Watchers patients lost weight within the first three months, some had put it back on again after five years. Battling the bulge: Nearly a quarter of adults are obese and experts predict this will increase to a half by 2040 . In addition, she warned that some Weight Watchers data may be inaccurate because it is based on patients' own measurements. A spokesman for the company said: 'Weight Watchers has a transparent and credible approach to science. 'We work with world-renowned obesity researchers who run independent studies. 'Evidence from published papers demonstrates that the majority of those who lose weight with Weight Watchers' help do not regain it after the programme ends.'","GPs routinely refer patients to the classes, which cost £45 for three months .

Up to 25,000 patients have been wrongly removed from GP lists in an NHS cost-cutting drive. Staff at practices have been told to trawl their registers and strike-off any patients who have died or moved away. It followed concerns that the NHS was wasting millions of pounds paying GPs to treat ‘ghost’ patients who didn’t exist. Up to 25,000 patients have been wrongly removed from GP lists in an NHS cost-cutting drive . But figures obtained by Pulse magazine show that around 4,030 genuine patients have been mistakenly removed over the last year. Most trusts weren’t able to provide data in response to Freedom of Information requests. So if these results are replicated across England, some 25,000 patients have been wrongly struck off. Many are likely to be elderly patients who have to go through the ordeal of re-registering - and providing proof of address and a valid ID. Dr Richard Vautrey, of the British . Medical Association said: ‘This blunt blanket approach taken by PCTs has . impacted on many genuine patients, losing their registration with their . GP. 'We have brought it up with the Government on many occasions but they seem to be blind to the problems they’re creating.’ Doctors have warned that patients taken off lists will miss out on invitations to be immunised or screened for conditions such as cancer . Dr Barry Moyse, a senior GP in Somerset said: ‘It’s risky - patients taken off lists will miss out on invitations to smear tests, breast cancer screening and immunisation. It’s throwing the baby out with the bathwater.’ Each surgery receives £65 a year for every person on their books, regardless of how often they make an appointment. But last year the Department of Health has there were as many as 2.5 million ‘phantom’ patients lurking on GPs books who have died or moved away.

South London Healthcare is the first NHS trust ever to be dissolved. The three hospitals it runs will be taken over by neighbouring trusts after Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the organisation was losing money which was being taken away from patient care. The South London Healthcare Trust, which runs three hospitals including Queen Elizabeth in Woolwich (pictured), is to be broken up . Although there have been some improvements to services in recent months, waiting times for some operations are among the longest in the country. The trust runs Queen Mary’s in Sidcup, Queen Elizabeth in Woolwich and the Princess Royal University Hospital in Bromley, serving more than a million patients. The decision to break it up by October sets a precedent for the Health Service and other failing hospitals could follow suit. Ministers have ordered another 30 NHS trusts with combined debts of £300million to address their finances or face intervention. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt today announced that A&E and maternity services at Lewisham Hospital in south-east London are to be downgraded . Mr Hunt also announced that Lewisham A&E unit in South London would be scaled down to an urgent care centre. The changes would save 100 lives a year as critically ill patients would be taken to larger, more specialised units at other hospitals, he said. Health secretary Jeremy Hunt (pictured) said the Lewisham A&E unit would be scaled-down into an urgent care centre . But Labour warned the plans would set a ‘dangerous precedent’ for other emergency departments across the country. Last Saturday more than 15,000 campaigners marched against the proposals, including some patients who said they owed their lives to the Lewisham unit. Mr Hunt told the Commons: ‘The longstanding problems at South London Healthcare NHS Trust must not be allowed to compromise patient care in the future. ‘Hundreds of millions of pounds have been spent on paying for debt rather than improving patient care for the local community in South-East London. ‘What is in the clinical interests of patients in South-East London has been at the heart of my decision-making process, and as a result I have followed clinical advice to keep open the A&E in Lewisham. ‘However, some changes need to be made so that money is spent on patient care rather than servicing historic debt. The decisions I have taken today will ensure that, and that patients in South-East London will be able to rely on the NHS for years to come.’ Labour health spokesman Andy Burnham said: ‘Just when you thought this Government’s mis-management of the National Health Service couldn’t get any worse, it just has. ‘The Secretary of State has just crossed a line and set dangerous precedents, namely that in his new market-driven NHS finance takes precedence and any hospital is vulnerable to changes, no matter how successful, through back-door reconfiguration.’","South London .

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses known to cause illness ranging from the common cold to SARS . A new Sars-like illness is spreading between humans, experts warn. So far there have been just three confirmed cases of Coronavirus in Britain - and only 11 in the world. Initially scientists assumed it could only be caught from animals and was mainly confined to the Middle East. But today the Health Protection Agency confirmed that a man had apparently caught the disease from a relative. This latest case is the first evidence that the virus can spread between humans. Officials at the HPA insist that the . victim was suffering from long-term health problems that made him more . susceptible to the illness. They stress that the overall threat to . the population remains low - and it is far less dangerous than Sars . which claimed hundreds of lives.

He is thought to have caught the . disease from a relation, who became infected in the Middle East, and is . being treated at a Manchester hospital. Professor John Watson, head of the . respiratory diseases department at the HPA, said: ‘This case is a family . member who was in close personal contact with the earlier case and who . may have been at greater risk of acquiring an infection because of their . underlying health condition. 'To date, evidence of person-to-person . transmission has been limited.

The latest patient to become infected with the coronavirus is being treated at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham . ‘If novel coronavirus were more infectious, we would have expected to have seen a larger number of cases than we have seen since the first case was reported three months ago.’ A third patient who contracted the illness in Qatar in September is still being treated at another hospital in Britain. There have been another eight cases worldwide, mainly in the Middle East, and seven of the patients died. Scientists have likened the infection to Sars, which claimed 900 lives worldwide between 2002 and 2003 . At present they are not sure exactly how it is transmitted but it is thought to be mainly viaay be via animals or their droppings. Sars, or Severe acute respiratory syndrome, which originated in China in November 2002.

The head of the NHS has spent thousands of pounds of taxpayers’ money on weekly trips to Birmingham – where, coincidentally, his new wife lives. Sir David Nicholson has racked up nearly £6,000 in first-class train tickets in a year, on top of his £270,000 pay package. On each occasion he claims to have been ‘attending an official meeting’ but they were apparently held via video conferencing, meaning he could have taken part from anywhere in the country. Criticism: Sir David Nicholson (right) could face calls to resign after it was revealed that he racked up nearly £6,000 in first-class train tickets in a year to Birmingham - coincidentally where his young wife Sarah-Jane Marsh (left) lives . But many of the trips span long weekends, prompting speculation he is going home to his young wife. Next week, Sir David is likely to face calls to resign when he is implicated in one of the NHS’s worst ever hospital scandals at Mid Staffordshire Trust. A long-awaited report is expected to criticise him for failing to take action while patients were dying of neglect. Examination of his expenses claims reveal that in the year 2011/12 Sir David, 57, spent £5,730.50 on 41 train tickets to Birmingham, nearly all of which were first class. This is near where he lives with his 35-year-old wife, Sarah-Jane Marsh, the £155,000-a-year chief executive of Birmingham Children’s Hospital. The couple, who have a two-month-old daughter, married last year after Sir David divorced his first wife. He divides his working schedule between London and Leeds, where the NHS Commissioning Board is based. But the Department of Health insisted that he also needed to be in Birmingham as it is a ‘central location’. A spokesman also said that some of the official meetings he attended in the city were held via video conferencing.  This would enable Sir David to speak to colleagues in London, Leeds or elsewhere using his laptop. He used an office in Birmingham for this. But they were unable to explain why . he needed to travel to Birmingham to chair a video-conference rather . than holding it from his offices in London or Leeds. Matthew . Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘The . startling regularity of Sir David’s trips to Birmingham at the end of a . week beg the question whether these are actually necessary business . trips or just an excuse to bill taxpayers for visits to his wife. ‘The NHS must be totally transparent over this incredibly large expenses bill.’ Julie Bailey of Cure the NHS, whose mother died in the care of Mid Staffordshire NHS trust, said: ‘It is outrageous that he is able to claim this amount when he has got to his position through failure.’ Sir David claimed just under £50,000 in expenses last year. This was on top of his £211,000 a year salary, £47,000 ‘benefits in kind’ and £20,000 bonus - although he says he gives this to charity. Implicated: Sir David is likely to face calls to resign when he is implicated in one of the NHS's worst ever hospital scandals at Mid Staffordshire Trust . Until recently he had been living in the village of Darley, just outside Harrogate, near Leeds. But he now lives in a three-bedroom cottage with his wife in Broome, an attractive village a short drive from Birmingham. Next week Sir David will come under pressure over his role in the Mid Staffordshire scandal, where up to 1,200 patients died between 2005 and 2008. He was previously chief executive of the regional health board  which covered Stafford – the West Midlands Strategic Health Authority – yet failed to spot the warning signs. He may also be criticised for failing to listen to the concerns of families when he was appointed chief executive of the NHS in 2006. Earlier this week, Sir David issued an apology for the failings. But the report into the scandal – to be published on Wednesday – is likely to warn that appalling neglect still persists in some areas of NHS. A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘The nature and responsibilities of the role of NHS Chief Executive require travel across the country, in keeping with a significant national public role at the head of the largest organisation in Europe. All travel is booked in advance wherever possible and journeys are mainly by rail.’ The spokesman said Sir David worked from an office in Birmingham owned by West Midlands Strategic Health Authority, where he was formerly chief executive.","Sir David Nicholson has spent nearly £6,000 in train tickets to Birmingham .

Dame Barbara Hakin allegedly halted a review into high mortality rates at the trust and threatened to sack Mr Walker . A health chief who threatened to sack a whistleblower is now under investigation for quashing a probe into high death rates at his hospital. Dame Barbara Hakin, who is one of the most powerful women in the NHS, has been referred to the General Medical Council for allegedly ditching an inspection at United Lincolnshire NHS trust three years ago. As many as 670 patients are feared to have died unnecessarily at the trust since 2009. Concerned that the hospital’s ‘target culture’ was putting patients at risk, Gary Walker – who was then the trust’s chief executive and has since turned whistleblower – told Dame Barbara in 2009 he was planning to get an external review of mortality rates. He was concerned that patients who weren’t seriously ill were being treated ahead of urgent cases, simply to allow the trust to meet targets. But Dame Barbara, 55, who has been described as the ‘right-hand woman’ of NHS Chief Sir David Nicholson, is said to have halted the review and warned Mr Walker he ‘would have to go’. She has also been accused of writing a letter to the hospital trust ordering it to meet its waiting list targets ‘whatever the demand’. Mr Walker said Dame Barbara told him in a face to face the trust must hit targets despite it being full to breaking point. This, he claims, endangered patients because meeting the non-emergency targets would require him to turn away emergency patients or cut down on care. In a handwritten note, Dame Barbara said to the chairman of the East Midlands Strategic Health Authority John Brigstocke: ‘Need to meet targets whatever demand.’ The Mail understands that the GMC is now investigating a number of claims that Dame Barbara’s actions put patients at risk. The GMC will now decide whether Dame Barbara – a former Bradford GP who is a senior director on the NHS Commissioning Board on a salary of £70,000 a year – should be hauled in front of a disciplinary hearing. This could lead to her being suspended or even struck off. Whistleblower: Gary Walker, former chief executive for United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS trust, has defied a legal gag to speak out against NHS management . Although she no longer practises as a GP, the humiliation would be disastrous for her career as one of the most senior NHS executives. The allegations, which date back to 2009 when Dame Barbara was head of the regional body in charge of United Lincolnshire NHS Trust, were made by Dr Phil Hammond and Andrew  Bousfield, a journalist, who handed the GMC a dossier of evidence. Dame Barbara has been described as the 'right-hand woman' of NHS boss Sir David Nicholson, pictured . A spokesman for the GMC said it would not comment on cases under investigation. Dame Barbara lives in Oxenhope, West Yorkshire, with her husband, Dr Ronald Hakin, 75, a retired neurologist. She has two grown-up children. Initially she was chief executive of Bradford Primary Care Trust and was then appointed head of the East Midlands Strategic Health Authority, which was in charge of United Lincolnshire hospitals. In 2009 she was made a dame for her ‘services to healthcare’ and at the time said she was ‘very honoured’. She is now the national managing director of commissioning development at the NHS Commissioning Board – the new body in charge of hospitals and GP services. A spokesman for the strategic health authority said: ‘During her tenure as SHA chief executive, Dame Barbara acted at all times in the interest of patients, ensuring that they received high quality and safe services.’ Mr Walker said he had told Dame Barbara that he was going to order a mortality rate review at the hospital due to the high number of patients he was having to treat. He said: ‘I emailed Dame Barbara to set the agenda for the meeting the following day and I said I wanted to order a mortality review. ‘When I met her, she didn’t want to speak about it. She was incensed by my email. Her words were: “You will have to go or your career will be in tatters”.’ He claimed: ‘If she had acted on my concerns, I believe fewer people would have died.’ Gary Walker was paid £500,000 to keep quiet after he was removed as chief executive of the United Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust .","Gary Walker claims Dame Barbara Hakin threatened him for sparking review .

Hanging on: The head of the NHS, Sir David Nicholson, was clinging to his job last night after fresh attacks from politicians and grieving families . The head of the NHS was clinging to his job last night after fresh attacks from politicians and grieving families. They insist Sir David Nicholson should pay the price for presiding over the Mid Staffordshire hospital disaster that cost the lives of up to 1,200 patients. Earlier this week it emerged he also ignored warnings about another hospital trust under investigation for the needless deaths of 670 people. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt increased the pressure on Sir David by condemning a culture of ‘institutional self-preservation’ within the NHS. As the row intensified yesterday: . Mr Walker revealed he had told Sir David targets were being put ahead of patients at United Lincolnshire hospitals four years ago – but he was removed, paid off and forced to sign a gagging clause. On Wednesday, he ignored a threatening email from NHS lawyers to give an interview to the Daily Mail in which he attacked Sir David and said he was not interested in patient safety. The second whistleblower is David Bowles, the former chairman of United Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust, and Mr Walker’s former boss. He said he sent a letter in July 2009 to Sir David, warning that patients could die there because managers were being forced to meet unrealistic targets. He claimed the NHS chief executive failed to investigate the detailed allegations properly. Under pressure: Grieving families insist Sir David should pay the price for presiding over the Mid Staffordshire hospital disaster that cost the lives of up to 1,200 patients . Mr Bowles says he left his job in 2009 after being threatened with suspension when he refused to commit his organisation to meeting national waiting targets. ‘I was put under pressure by NHS bureaucrats to force Gary Walker to leave, but I refused because he was doing a good job of shielding the organisation under relentless pressure to put targets first,’ he said. ‘I wrote to Nicholson in the hope that the full weight of my concerns may be taken seriously. The allegations were serious – I actually referred to the possibility of becoming another Mid Staffordshire hospital calamity – but the inquiry did not look at safety or the breaches of the codes.’ Mr Hunt did not directly attack Sir David yesterday but called for a ‘culture change’ in the Health Service, which currently puts ‘targets ahead of everything else’. Not happy: Whistleblower Gary Walker, pictured, spoke of the 'Stalinist' nature of the Health Service and of 'battlefield scenes' at the hospital where he was forced to quit as chief executive . Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s World at . One he added: ‘Too much of the system is concerned with institutional . self-preservation instead of actually getting to the bottom of whether . there are patient safety issues.’ Mr . Hunt said he had written to the chief executive asking why Mr Walker . was gagged, adding: ‘The first thing a good organisation does when it . hears of something that’s gone wrong is to investigate whether there’s . any truth in the allegations and get to the bottom of it.’ Meanwhile two Tory MPs on the Commons health select committee have called on Sir David to consider his position. Chris Skidmore, MP for Kingswood, said: ‘I’m deeply uncomfortable that he remains in position. ‘I do feel moving forward that the only way in which we are going to get the changes needed is if there is a change in leadership at the very top. We’ve got to end this incessant culture of the revolving door of management leadership.’ Sarah Wollaston, a former GP who is MP for Totnes in Devon, said: ‘David Nicholson would set an example of leaders taking responsibility for their organisations, not scapegoating, if he stepped down.’ Yesterday a campaigner who helped expose the Mid Staffordshire scandal delivered a letter to the Prime Minister calling for Sir David to go. Julie Bailey, 51, who founded Cure the NHS after her mother died at the trust, said: ‘We believe Sir David has presided over the worst disaster in the history of the NHS. ‘He is the person in charge and he needs to be sacked. We need a leader that inspires and galvanises those working in the NHS and I’m afraid this man doesn’t. He’s a failure.’ Other campaigners have set up a petition on a government website calling for him to resign. More than 2,500 have signed it. Sir David, whose annual salary package is £270,000, insists he is ‘not ashamed’ to still be in his post because the failure were ‘system wide’ rather than individual. He has faced increasing calls to resign since a report into the Mid Staffordshire scandal was published last week. He was in charge of the regional body supposedly overseeing Mid Staffordshire but which failed to pick up on the horrific standards of care. Sir David also appointed the trust’s chief executive – even though he had had no formal training – who axed more than 50 nurses. As chief executive of the Department of Health he is said to have dismissed warnings from relatives of patients who died, saying they were ‘simply lobbying’. Up to 1,200 patients are thought to have died unnecessarily at Mid Staffordshire between 2005 and 2009 and many others suffered ‘inhumane’ and ‘degrading’ neglect. Demands: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, left, increased the pressure on Sir David by condemning a culture of ‘institutional self-preservation’ within the NHS.  Campaigner Julie Bailey, right, has called for Sir David to go . Wealthy: Sir David Nicholson earns £270,000 a-year as the chief executive of the NHS . This month, the NHS has been rocked by two of the most serious scandals . in its history. And, at the centre of both, stands the ex-Communist Sir . David Nicholson, its £270,000-a-year chief executive. Most reasonable people, we suspect, will find it astonishing that he did . not resign last Wednesday, when a public inquiry revealed the most . appalling, inhumane neglect at Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust, when he was . the bureaucrat in charge. If anybody in the private sector had presided over a failure which led . to the deaths of up to 1,200 people, they would have been sacked. But Sir David is a man without shame. He only offered token contrition, . and insisted he would not resign as it was a system failure. Now – thanks to whistleblower Gary Walker – we are learning more . shocking details of another cover-up involving Sir David, at the United . Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust. First, Sir David ignored warnings by Mr Walker that an obsession with . targets was resulting in squalid conditions on the wards that were . almost certainly costing lives. Then Sir David’s side-kick, Barbara . Hakin (later a dame), began a campaign which led to Mr Walker being . sacked as the Lincolnshire Trust’s chief executive – and gagged with . £500,000 of taxpayers’ money. Who do these people think they are? They use our money to give . themselves huge salaries. Then, when someone complains about their . incompetence, they again use our money to gag them. This paper believes it is incredible that – while hundreds of police are . arresting journalists for hacking into celebrities’ phones – not a . single NHS bureaucrat has had their collar felt over the countless . deaths of terrifyingly vulnerable people. But then these high officials and quangocrats – so reminiscent of the commissars in Stalin’s Russia – are Britain’s new elite. They expect knighthoods. They demand the salaries and all the  perks of high-flying executives in the private sector. But there is a crucial difference. In the private sector, when things go . wrong, heads fall. In the NHS, it is the fault of ‘systemic failure’. The Mail is not in the business of  calling for people in public life . to resign. But so egregious are the outrages that have taken place under . Sir David that we support those victims’ relatives who demonstrated . outside Number Ten yesterday to demand his head. Every day this modern day apparatchik remains in post is an affront to . morality, justice – and the patients whose lives he destroyed. Sir David could face further pressure . if MPs on the Commons public accounts committee decide to quiz him over . his expenses next month. The Mail has revealed he has spent £6,000 of . public money on trips to Birmingham – where his wife lives. Many of the visits spanned long weekends, prompting speculation he was using taxpayers’ money for private purposes. It . emerged last night that doctors, nurses and managers responsible for . the horrific neglect at Mid Staffordshire hospitals could be charged . with manslaughter. Police are to consider whether they have enough evidence to prosecute individual members of staff over the scandal. So far not a single member of staff has been prosecuted or even sacked over the deaths between 2005 and 2009. Hard-hitting: This is the front page of last Thursday's Daily Mail . An inquiry into the disaster published last week refused to scapegoat individual medical staff or managers – and instead blamed failures across the system. But Mr Hunt has since urged police to investigate cases saying it was ‘outrageous’ nobody had been brought to book. Last night Staffordshire police said they would be carrying out a joint probe with the Crown Prosecution Service to see if they had enough evidence to press for criminal charges. A spokesman said charges could include manslaughter or criminal neglect. Officers will review the 1,900 pages of the inquiry published last week and cross reference it with existing evidence, he said.","Sir David Nicholson is clinging to his £270,000-a-year job .

Care: NHS staff admit they would not want their families to be treated in the hospitals they work at. Picture posed by models . Thousands of NHS workers would not send relatives to their own hospitals because the care is so poor, according to a survey. One in four doctors, nurses and other staff at some trusts have admitted they don’t rate the standards at their own workplace. The worst trust was Croydon, in South London, where 30 per cent of staff said they would not recommend it to friends or family. This week a high-profile report will call for major changes to the health service in the wake of one of the worst-ever hospital scandals. As many as 1,200 patients died because of poor care at Mid Staffordshire NHS trust between 2005 and 2008, and doctors have admitted they were ‘immune’ to their anguish. NHS bosses say the release of the report on Wednesday will be one of the ‘darkest days’ of the health service’s history. The poll of doctors, nurses and other medical staff asked whether they would recommend their organisation to friends or relatives. At five trusts, at least a quarter of workers said they wouldn’t, because standards were so poor. They are Croydon; Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals; Royal Cornwall Hospitals; South London Healthcare; and North Cumbria University Hospitals. The report into the Mid Staffordshire scandal is expected to warn that similar standards of neglect still exist at some hospitals. Patients were left to become so dehydrated they were forced to drink from vases and nurses were threatened with violence for exposing poor care. The report will call for major changes to the NHS – including tougher hospital inspections and laws to prevent cover-ups – to prevent a repeat of the disaster. At five trusts, a quarter of hospital workers said they wouldn't recommend their organisation to loved ones. File picture . Mike Farrar, head of the NHS Confederation, which represents health workers, said: ‘This Wednesday will be one of the darkest days for the NHS but we must turn it into an opportunity to build a better NHS for patients. THE head of the NHS will be quizzed by MPs over his expenses. Sir David Nicholson racked up £6,000 on weekly first-class train tickets to Birmingham, where his new wife lives. He said all of the 41 trips last year were for ‘official meetings’, but many were carried out via video-conferencing – and he has not explained why he needed to travel to Birmingham to chair them. Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons’ public accounts committee, said she would question Sir David on the issue at the next hearing. ‘Our failings in Mid Staffordshire will be laid bare – and rightly so. We have to respond. We need to make it easier for patients to give feedback. ‘The people in charge of running our health services should rightly be held to account when they fail to act in the interests of patients.’ The head of the Royal College of Nursing has admitted that many workers have just an hour’s training before being allowed to care for patients. Dr Peter Carter said healthcare assistants – who account for nearly half of nursing staff – were often ‘picking it up as they go along’. He added: ‘If you walk into a ward for older people, this is where you find most of the problems, most of the staff nowadays are not nurses; they are healthcare assistants. ‘There’s nothing wrong with healthcare assistants, providing they have had a proper training and education, but in far too many cases they’ve not had as much as an hour’s training.’ There are about 300,000 healthcare assistants in the NHS. They wear similar uniforms to nurses, but have no medical qualifications or formal training.","A quarter of medical staff say they don't rate standards, according to a poll .

"By . Sophie Borland . PUBLISHED: . 20:03 EST, 12 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:48 EST, 13 February 2013 . Dangerous: QC Robert Francis, who last week delivered a report on the scandal at Mid Staffordshire hospitals, said healthcare assistants have only 'a few hours training' before being ¿let loose¿ on patients . Hospital staff caring for the most vulnerable patients have less training for their job and face fewer checks than bouncers or minicab drivers, an expert warned yesterday. Robert Francis said healthcare assistants have only ‘a few hours training’ before being ‘let loose’ on patients. The QC warned there was nothing to stop a worker found totally unfit at one hospital being employed by another. Last week Mr Francis delivered a damning report into the scandal at Mid Staffordshire hospitals, where hundreds died because of poor care. But he warned that failings in the NHS meant the disaster could well be repeated in other hospitals. He urged the Health Service to make a number of key changes to improve care and ensure hospitals and staff are rigorously checked. They included making healthcare assistants undergo basic training before allowing them on wards. There are around 300,000 of these staff – also known as healthcare support workers – in the NHS. They are mainly responsible for basic care, including feeding, washing and dressing patients, yet most have no medical qualifications or training. And, because they are not regulated by a watchdog, they cannot be barred from working even if found guilty of appalling lapses. Mr Francis said: ‘Someone who is allowed to provide direct physical care for any patient, let alone highly vulnerable people who cannot speak for themselves, should be the subject of at least some record. ‘It seems strange to me that there is more regulation for nightclub doormen and minicab drivers than healthcare support workers. A healthcare assistant who is found totally unfit at one hospital can walk down the road and get a job at another, and nobody needs to know about what happens in the other place.’ Giving evidence to MPs at the health select committee, he added: ‘The amount of training before they are let loose on patients can be as little as a few hours. I was concerned to find there seemed to be no consistency at all for this grade of work. ‘They should have to have some record of who they are, how you can get hold of them, where they are employed and if they no longer work there then why not. Everyone talks about basic care as if it is something very easy. We need some training standards. They don’t need to be very complicated but we do need to test people’s aptitude.’ The Royal College of Nursing has repeatedly warned the lack of training for healthcare support workers is putting patients at risk. Repeat warning: Mr Francis warned that failings in the NHS meant the Mid Staffordshire disaster could well be repeated in other hospitals . Last month its general secretary Dr Peter Carter said most of these workers were just picking it up as they went along. He said: ‘If you walk into a ward for older people, this is where you find most of the problems, most of the staff nowadays are not nurses; they are healthcare assistants. ‘There’s nothing wrong with healthcare assistants providing they have had a proper training and education, but in far too many cases they’ve not had as much as an hour of training. ‘Who can understand a situation where you employ someone, put a uniform on them so they look like a nurse, put them on to a ward or in a care home, and the mindset is: “You pick it up as you go along”?’ Healthcare assistants wear similar tunics to nurses and can be distinguished only by the title on their name badges. Some earn just £7 an hour – less than a cleaner . Bouncers have to undergo training and sit an exam before they can gain the licence that allows them to work. They must prove they can  confiscate drugs, cope with a medical emergency and deal with drunken revellers. Minicab drivers must hold a clean driving licence and have to sit a 40-minute written test set by their local council. They must also go to a GP for a medical.","Robert Francis said healthcare assistants only have a 'few hours' training .

A spokesman said: 'This virus is exclusive to birds, so there is no risk for public safety.' Slaughter: Between a million and two million chicken have been culled in Mexico after contracting bird flu . Nearly two million birds have been vaccinated, with plans for millions more in the coming months. CNN reported that authorities reported different numbers of how many infected birds had been slaughtered. Earlier this week Agriculture Minister Enrique Martinez said that more than 2.1million chickens had been killed, including 519,000 egg-producing chickens, 722,265 breeding chickens and 900,000 chickens raised for meat. Authorities say the strain is not one that affects humans and say the situation is under control . However, Javier Usabiaga Arroyo, a state agriculture official, later said the total number was about 1.2million, according to Mexico's state-run Notimex news agency. Officials have vaccinated 1.9million birds since the outbreak began earlier this month, and they plan to vaccinate millions more. The Government also attempted to allay fears about food prices spiking, saying the number is a fraction of the overall chicken population. 'The outbreak of avian influenza is controlled,' Mexico's food safety agency said in a statement. Other strains of bird flu have spread to humans, sparking mass culls. In January 1998, authorities in Hong Kong ordered all chickens for sale in markets to be destroyed after the H5N1 strand infected 18 people, killing six. Later that year a major outbreak of the H5N1 virus in West Bengal, India lead to the culling of 2.6 million birds. In 2006 there were 65 outbreaks of H5N1 worldwide, killing a total of 115 people - the highest number to die from the disease in a single year.

Ranger Michael Maguire, 21, originally from County Cork, Ireland, was on his lunch break when he was hit in the temple by a shot probably fired by a fellow soldier attacking a static target one kilometre away. The inquest heard that he was not wearing a helmet at the time and was stood in a secure administrative area of the range in Pembrokeshire, Wales. Accident: Ranger Michael Maguire, 21, died after being shot in the head during a training exercise . Ranger Maguire had survived a tour of Afghanistan but died after the accident at the Castlemartin Ranges in May last year. Army medics and civilian paramedics battled to save Ranger Maguire's life before he was urgently airlifted to hospital in Cardiff. But the soldier, of the 1st Battalion, The Royal Irish Regiment, was pronounced dead within 30 minutes of his arrival. The inquest in Cardiff heard evidence from Army medic Corporal Michael Gleeson who spoke of the frantic efforts made to keep Mr Maguire alive following the shooting. Mr Maguire had been standing in a designated administrative area, deemed to be secure, outside the training area with his armour and helmet off. Cpl Gleeson arrived within two minutes of the shooting: 'I was informed the wound was on the left side of the temple,' he said. 'He was making gurgling sounds and had a little vomit in his mouth. At no time while I was with him was he conscious.' He said another medic used a manual pump to assist breathing and they rolled him over to resuscitate him.

The efforts were continued when civilian paramedics arrived on the scene while awaiting the arrival of an air ambulance. Earlier the resumed inquest, which sat for two days in November, heard how the group of soldiers were taking part in low level infantry training at the time of the shooting. It was seen as an early stage in their build up to a second tour of duty in Afghanistan, earmarked for this spring. The court also heard a statement made by Ranger Maguire's father Michael Maguire senior. He said: 'He was a sporting, fit lad and very lovable and he was always very happy with army life.'

If you are one of the thousands of Britons planning to flip a pancake or two on Shrove Day tomorrow then your work just got made a whole lot easier.. or harder, depending on your grasp of science. The formula for the perfect pancake mix has been revealed as 100 - [10L - 7F + C(k - C) + T(m - T)]/(S - E), and was developed by mathematicians at the University of Wolverhampton. Retailer Debenhams unveiled the mathematical formula for the perfect pancake - claiming in the process to be able to eliminate sub-standard crepes across kitchens forever. Pancake perfection! 100 - [10L - 7F + C(k - C) + T(m - T)]/(S - E) The science: The formula was developed by researchers at the University of Wolverhampton . Households all over the UK will be flipping traditional pancakes in celebration of Shrove Tuesday - in most cases, resulting in lumpy batter and floor splatter. Spokesperson for Debenhams Lizzie Singleton explains: ‘L represents the number of lumps in the batter and C equals its consistency. F stands for the flipping score, k is the ideal consistency and T is the temperature of the pan. ‘The perfect pan temperature is represented by m, S is the time the batter stands before cooking and E is the time the cooked pancake stands before being eaten - the closer to 100 the result is, the better the pancake.’ Whether the formula will translate from paper to pancake pan is another matter entirely. Sophie Bathgate, founder of Sophie’s restaurant in London offers her four top flipping tips. Worried your home made pancakes will turn out a flop? Tempted to leave it to the professionals? Don't be the first to flip! With Shrove Tuesday fast approaching this February, pancake aficionado Sophie Bathgate and her pastry team share some top tips for how to make the perfect pancakes this Shrove Tuesday. They certainly know what they're talking about too. During the first weekend of the launch of their 'Breakfast on the Beach' in Fulham Road, they knocked out over 300 pancakes before 10am. 1. Be prepared . Don't be afraid to prep in advance. Create your mix slowly with a generous pinch of rock salt the night before you plan to get flipping. Your pancakes will definitely taste better. 2. Don't go first . Use a heavy frying pan - it will help with the perfect flip action & wait until it's hot, hot, hot. Be warned, if you are in a competitive environment, the first one is always a disappointment. 3. Thin is the name of the game . Smooth, round edges & as thin as you dare is what you are aiming for. 4. Embrace your inner child . Slide straight out of the frying pan, smear with Nutella & eat immediately. Heavenly! Shoppers in search of the perfect . pancake have been stocking up on new equipment over the past week, with . frying pan sales up by 50 per cent at Debenhams, in a bid to wow their . friends and families with the perfect pancake toss. According . to the results of a Debenhams survey, 86 per cent of households will be . enjoying pancakes today, yet only 14 per cent of those surveyed are . confident they know how to make, cook and flip the traditional Shrove . Tuesday dessert. Lizzie Singleton continues: ‘Coupled . with the right frying pan, following this formula will result in perfect . pancakes all round!’ Hooray! Remember the perfect amount of time between cooking and eating is 0 . ‘Simplifying the science behind this formula, our customers can have perfect pancakes tonight. 'The golden rules seem to be to have a good pan at 377 degrees, have zero lumps in the mixture, and leave the batter to stand for 30 minutes before cooking, making sure the pancakes are eaten straight away – that seems simple enough. ‘Once victim to overzealous pancake tossers, floors and ceilings will be free from mess this year!’ Regional survey results showed that those in Liverpool and Birmingham were the shyest about their pancake skills, with only 4 per cent believing they would be flipping successfully. Meanwhile, in the South East, 23 per cent of respondents were sure they had pancake tossing nailed and would be enjoying their pancakes triumphantly this evening. The survey also found that tde most popular type of pancake filling is still the traditional lemon and sugar combination, with 56 per cent opting for this as their filling of choice.

Then begin whisking the eggs - any sort of whisk or even a fork will do - incorporating any bits of flour from around the edge of the bowl as you do so. 2. Next gradually add small quantities of the milk and water mixture, still whisking (don’t worry about any lumps as they will eventually disappear as you whisk). When all the liquid has been added, use a rubber spatula to scrape any elusive bits of flour from around the edge into the centre, then whisk once more until the batter is smooth, with the consistency of thin cream. Now melt the 50g of butter in a pan. Spoon 2 tbsp of it into the batter and whisk it in, then pour the rest into a bowl and use it to lubricate the pan, using a wodge of kitchen paper to smear it round before you make each pancake. Stir the orange zest and caster sugar into the batter. Delicious: Crepe Pauline ready to eat . 3. Now get the pan really hot, then turn the heat down to medium and, to start with, do a test pancake to see if you’re using the correct amount of batter. These little crêpes should be thinner than the basic pancakes, so when you’re making them, use ½ tbsp of batter at a time in a 18cm pan. It’s also helpful if you spoon the batter into a ladle so it can be poured into the hot pan in one go. As soon as the batter hits the hot pan, tip it around from side to side to get the base evenly coated with batter. It should take only half a minute or so to cook; you can lift the edge with a palette knife to see if it’s tinged gold as it should be. The perfect pan: The new Tefal Jamie Oliver pancake pan, available at Debenhams.com, £30 . 4 Flip the pancake over with a pan slice or palette knife - the other side will need a few seconds only - then simply slide it out of the pan onto a plate. If the pancakes look a little bit ragged in the pan, no matter because they are going to be folded anyway. You should end up with 15-16 crêpes. 5. Stack the pancakes as you make them between sheets of greaseproof paper on a plate fitted over simmering water, to keep them warm while you make the rest. 6. For the sauce, mix all the ingredients - with the exception of the butter - in a bowl. At the same time warm the plates on which the crêpes are going to be served. Now melt the butter in the frying pan, pour in the sauce and allow it to heat very gently. Then place the first crêpes in the pan and give it time to warm through before folding it in half and then in half again to make a triangular shape. Slide this onto the very edge of the pan, tilt the pan slightly so the sauce runs back into the centre, then add the next crêpe. Continue like this until they’re all re-heated, folded and well soaked with the sauce. 7. You can flame them at this point if you like. Heat a ladle by holding it over a gas flame or by resting it on the edge of a hotplate, then, away from the heat, pour a little Marmalade Vodka into it, return it to the heat to warm the spirit, then set light to it. Carry the flaming ladle to the table over the pan and pour the flames over the crêpes before serving on the warmed plates.

A 28-year-old man has been charged with endangering children after his two-month-old daughter died over the weekend. Edward Doyle, 28, of Philadelphia, was taken into custody Sunday, according to the Montgomery County District Attorney's Office, reports The Philadelphia Enquirer, after the death of his daughter Makayla. Makayla was found unresponsive in the family's apartment on Sunday morning, according to court documents. She was taken to Hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Police say her death is still under investigation and an autopsy is underway. Officers who arrived at the home saw 'red swelling on Makayla's forehead and bruising and cuts on the bridge of her nose', according to court documents. Doyle told detectives he was carrying the child and hit a baby swing in the living room while he was walking. He fell and landed on top of her, according to the documents. He then checked to see if the girl was still breathing and put her in the baby swing, adding that he 'drank too much' and shouldn't have been caring for the child.

Jailed: Craig Seville, from Springhead, Oldham, hoarded hundreds of images of young girls on his home PC and trawled chatrooms to prey on children . A pilot who claimed the 'stresses' of running seven flying businesses in a recession turned him into an internet paedophile was behind bars today with his reputation in ruins. Craig Seville, 37, who ran his own flying school in Blackpool, Lancashire, hoarded hundreds of images of young girls on his home PC and trawled chatrooms to prey on children. He was caught in a sting operation by an undercover policewoman posing as a 12-year-old girl on the internet. Seville asked her to be his 'sexual pupil' before exposing himself to her on a webcam. Seville, from Springhead, Oldham, later claimed he carried out the offences after entering into a 'fantasy world to take him out of the real world' when factors including bad weather had left him in a distressed and difficult position. He has since lost all his businesses. At Preston Crown Court the boss of Blackpool Flying School, based at the resort's airport, and other associated firms was jailed for three and a half years. Judge Stuart Baker told him: 'This is not the stuff of fantasy - there's no fantasy world involving the abuse of children. 'The children depicted in the images are children being appallingly abused by adults elsewhere in the world.' The judge added: 'It is truly always a very sad occasion when a court has to impose a sentence on a mature man who has been industrious, who has had a successful career in business and well liked amongst his community, friends and family and well regarded and well respected. 'You have lost your business, your employment and your reputation and, no doubt for many years to come, bear a stigma amongst the community at large for these offences. 'It may well be that there was an element of fantasising about what you were doing but it is a fact that you assumed or, at least, believed that people with whom you were corresponding were under the age of 16. 'You engaged with them in inappropriate conversation and by enticing them into sexual activity. It took the form of grooming them towards the end. 'You might think by watching it you were not doing people harm but it is precisely because people watch it over an internet screen that there is such a flourishing business of producing this kind of material in the first place. Sentence: Seville was jailed for three and a half years at Preston Crown Court after pleading guilty to three charges . 'Watching this material gives oxygen to those who produce it. Those are real children, being badly abused.' Earlier Francis McEntee, prosecuting, said police had raided Seville's home in February last year. They recovered his laptop and discovered 436 photographs showing children being abused by adults - including one of an 18-month baby girl. Seville had also been using chat rooms - including one called 'Chat Avenue' - as a way to chat to teenage girls. 'He said he was curious but never intended it to lead to anything,' said Mr McEntee. 'He indicated that he had a web cam but he didn't use it. He had spoken to 14-year-old girls and asked what they were into sexually.' 'You might think by watching it you were . not doing people harm but it is precisely because people watch it over . an internet screen that there is such a flourishing business of . producing this kind of material in the first place' - Judge Stuart Baker . Seville, who would always be up front about his own age, would continue chatting privately to certain members on MSN. He admitted he got some sexual gratification from chatting to youngsters, describing it as being 'a virtual world, as if separated by the real world.' Seville was released on bail but was caught committing further offences by a police officer carrying out surveillance on the internet in September 2012. The prosecutor said: 'She indicated that she was 12, to which he replied, ""That's so sexy"". 'He asked her, ""Do you want to learn about sexual stuff? Would you be interested in trying and learning things with me?""' Five days later, he asked if she would like to meet up to kiss and experiment with him - trying to reassure her by saying he'd had relationships with girls aged 13 before. He then exposed himself on a web cam, for the 'girl' to see. When the 'girl' indicated that she may want to engage in sexual activity, Seville said they would only do it when 'totally ready and they would be very careful together'. MSN sexual conversations followed, before Seville was arrested. Business: Seville claimed the stresses of running his businesses during a recession, including a flying school at Blackpool Airport, turned him into an internet paedophile . Seville pleaded guilty to three charges - within a long list of offences dating between November 2011 to February 2012 - of distributing indecent images through Skype and MSN and attempting to engage a child in sexual activity. Defence lawyer Barbara Webster, stated her client - who had no previous convictions - had slipped into a 'fantasy world' after the stress of keeping his seven aeronautic businesses afloat in the recession and bad weather got too much for him. She said: 'From references, this individual had a good upbringing. He made his way up the ladder, he had a successful business, he obtained his pilot's licence, flew with DHL across the world and owned seven well maintained businesses. 'Due to a number of factors, he found himself in a very distressing and difficult position. As a result, stresses came to their highest point. He maintains that he entered into this fantasy world to take him out of the real world and, from there, became his own world away from everything else.' Seville was also ordered to sign the sex offenders' register for life and banned from working with children for life.","Craig Seville jailed for three and a half years after caught by police sting .

The health and safety warning was sent out ahead of filming for an episode in which the ashes of Derek Branning (pictured) were scattered . TV sets can often be dangerous places, but it appears as though the BBC might have taken things a step too far. The corporation recently filed a nine-page report outlining the health and safety risks of working in Cassiobury Park, Watford, with a dog that was hired for the day. In a risk assessment carried out for an episode in which the ashes of Derek Branning were scattered, actors were even warned about the dangers of the potentially harmful results of working with sheep. The document circulated among the cast and crew before the shoot told of the dangers of 'slippery' surfaces and cold weather. It also gave advice such as wearing 'appropriate clothing' and told workers to take 'warm drinks' for the scene which was filmed on Valentine's Day. A source on the set told The Sun: 'The BBC doesn't help itself sometimes with such nonsense. The cast and crew were in hysterics. 'It's a waste of time and shows the fear factor that's spread through the corporation.' Among those to receive the memo were characters Kat and Carol, played by Jessie Wallace and Lindsey Coulson respectively, and saw them scattering Derek's ashes. Because a dog called Duffie was hired for the day there was a warning about how to handle him, but it went well beyond the treatment of the dog. Danger zone? The filming took place at Cassiobury Park in Watford, Hertfordshire . The report said: 'Animals can cause injury, by bites, scratches, stings, kicking or crushing; infection or infestation from micro-organisms or parasites.' It also warned that there was a risk of miscarriage in pregnant workers because of harmful organisms on animals, 'especially sheep'. A BBC spokesman said: 'There is a legal requirement to undertake a risk assessment and this covered a wider range of activities than just working in the park.' They added that risk assessments cover blocks of filming and not just one episode.","One warning tells of dangers of pregnant women working with sheep .

A thug who wrapped wire around the necks of a mother and her three-year-old son during a terrifying violent attack has been jailed for three years. The victim of James Greenall, 21, was left wheelchair-bound from the injuries sustained after she jumped 12ft from an upstairs window to escape from the attack in which she thought she was going to be killed. Greenall repeatedly kicked and punched the mother during the sustained attack at her home in Bramley, Leeds, and then wrapped a TV cable around her neck and pulled it tight as she cowered on her bed with her three-year-old child. Leeds Crown Court heard the wire had also got wrapped around the child's neck during the attack. Greenall broke the woman's arm during his relentless barrage and when she showed him how badly she was injured, he simply retorted 'I don't care'. He did momentarily halt the attack, but only to tell his terrified victim that she had five seconds to put her child back to bed before making the chilling threat that he was going to kill her. Gerald Hendron, prosecuting, said that the victim believed she was about to be killed and jumped from an upstairs window to escape the clutches of her attacker - leaving her having to spend time in a wheelchair due to her injuries. Despite suffering fractures to both heels and a spinal injury as a result of the jump she still managed to reach a neighbour's house and they called the emergency services. The woman, who was seven years older than Greenall, also suffered a fractured arm, fractured hand, two black eyes and was left with a footprint on her face from where Greenall had stamped on her. Greenall was sentenced to three years in prison after pleading guilty to GBH with intent.

But these laughable faces pulled by a gang of fraudsters helped them con banks out of up to £10million. The mugshots were used to create dozens of fake passports and driving licences which enabled the men to open accounts in false names. Once they’d successfully applied for loans and overdrafts, they simply pocketed the cash and disappeared. Master of disguise: Fraudster Anthony Bridger pulled a variety of bizarre faces in passport photos in a bid to defraud banks of around £1.5million . Payback: Bridger has been ordered to repay £1.28million within six months or face six more years in jail . In one picture, gang leader Anthony . Bridger, 53, who owned a villa in the Cayman Islands and an apartment in . Monto Carlo, tried to change his appearance simply by blowing out his . cheeks. More than 200 images of Bridger trying . out different expressions were unearthed when police raided his . offices. At the offices of another gang leader, David Tunnicliffe, 38, . officers found four bogus passports and 26 driving licences all bearing . his photograph. They also recovered 26 birth certificates and numerous ‘deed poll documents’. The group were given varying jail . terms for their part in the scam but this week Bridger was the subject . of a hearing at Southwark Crown Court to recover some of the £1.5million . cash he raked in. He was jailed for four years and eight . months in 2011 for masterminding the con but was ordered to pay back . £1,280,000 within six months or face an additional six years. The court heard the gang ran the bank . accounts as if they were owned by real people, making transactions and . paying in what looked like high salaries in order to build up good . credit ratings. But they would then apply for an overdraft or loan and bleed the accounts dry, before moving on to other victims. Jailed: David Tunnicliffe was jailed for five years for his part in the scam from which he is thought to have made £2million . Prosecutor David Levy said: ‘This methodology was applied and there was a continuous stream of criminality, it was ongoing.’ He said the fraud was carried out as a ‘businesslike venture’ between 2003 and 2010. The fraud came to light when banks . including Lloyds TSB, Nat West, Barclays and HSBC  realised they were . losing huge sums of money and contacted the police. Tunnicliffe and Bridger, both of South-West London, were identified as the masterminds after a  14-month investigation. Tunnicliffe owned a property portfolio . including a villa in Spain and a house in Fulham, but had not paid any . tax for six years. He made around £2million from the fraud. Different faces: Tunnicliffe styled his hair differently and wore different glasses in a bid to fool the banks . At Bridger’s office, police found a . number of mobile phones all adorned with sticky notes giving the bogus . names that the number belonged to. He also kept one cheque from each bank account so he had a template of the bogus signature he had used. Richard Andrews, 41, who was a . lieutenant in the con, stuffed folders in the oven so officers would not . discover the bogus identity documents in his possession. He earned at . least £1.2million from the fraud. Gurning: Senior gang member Richard Andrews raked in £1.2million .

Dave and Mike (who don't want to reveal their last name) told MSN Today that their cousin made the order to stop them checking out the single ladies at the wedding. Scroll down for video . Plus one: When brothers Dave (left) and Mike were told by their cousin that they had to bring dates to her wedding, they turned to Craigslist to find dates and got nearly 2,000 responses . The ad they posted last week described the siblings as 'dashingly tall, Anglo-Saxon' men who 'love to party, completely house-trained'. And what lady could resist: 'Raw, emotional, sensitive but still bad boys.' So far Dave and Mike estimate they have received almost 2,000 responses - mostly serious. They had initially planned to take two sisters they knew, but that fell through when they discovered one of them was in Uganda doing clinical work. Dave and Mike brainstormed a back-up plan and came up with the unorthodox approach. In their tongue-in-cheek ad, the brothers encouraged pairs of women to respond, so they will know at least one other person at the wedding. It reads:  'Sisters (twins?!) are preferable, but we'll take friends, or even enemies. Jill (left), a pretty 22-year-old from New York and Jayne, also 22, attractive and from the Big Apple, are in the frame for the big day .

Competition may be fierce because the . brothers have promised a cut of any royalties should the whole wacky . incident get turned into a romantic comedy by Hollywood execs, something . that they think has an '85 per cent' chance of happening. But they do have strict instruction for Hollywood bigwigs: 'We refuse to let Ashton Kutcher play either of our characters, however, we will consider him for a supporting role.' Among . the hopeful are New Yorkers Jill and Jayne, both 22, who described . themselves as 'genuinely fun and a bit nuts' and sent a PowerPoint . presentation detailing their qualities. Another applicant ended her . response by singing a personalised verse from the Journey tune 'Don’t Stop Believing'. Dave . liked that it rhymed and Mike felt it was creative. 'The timing was on.

A mother and daughter have today been jailed after dealing crack cocaine from an alleyway. Terry Beaumont, 51, and her daughter Jane Leonard, 33, appeared at Teesside Crown Court alongside two others involved in conspiracy to supply Class A drugs. Prosecutor Sue Jacobs told the court that police had observed the home of Leonard over three days in February last year and saw both mother and daughter, as well as co-defendant Jake Hutchinson, meeting people in the alleyway to the back of the house. Mother and daughter Terry Beaumont, 51, and Jane Leonard, 33 (pictured right and left at Teesside Crown Court today) were jailed for two and a half years each today after being caught dealing crack cocaine in an alleyway . Officers . stopped Beaumont in the alley behind the house in central . Stockton-on-Tees, and found her carrying a package of crack cocaine. When they went into the home, a fourth defendant  - Alex Ibbotson, 21 -  was seen throwing more packages of crack - with a street value of £505 - on to the floor. He had a further £657 worth of the drug hidden on his person. Hutchinson, 19, had also been seen throwing packages to the floor. These were found to be heroin worth £74. A small amount of tamazepam was also found. More crack was found on Beaumont and around the home. Mrs Jacobs said the overall value of the drugs recovered was £1,254 of crack cocaine and £85 of heroin. Ibbotson, of Blackbush Walk, Thornaby, Stockton, Leonard, now of Norcliffe Street, North Ormesby, Middlesbrough, and Beaumont, of Green's Beck Road, Hartburn, in Stockton, pleaded guilty to conspiring to supply crack cocaine. Hutchinson denied this charge. Hutchinson, of Sun Gardens, Thornaby, Leonard and Beaumont admitted conspiring to supply heroin between the same dates. Ibbotson denied this charge. Hutchinson also admitted possession of the Class C drug tamazepam. Mrs Jacobs said all pleas were accepted. The pair appeared at Teesside Crown Court alongside two others involved in conspiracy to supply Class A drugs . Paul Abrahams, defending Leonard, said his client had played a 'lesser role' and added: 'She, and it would appear her mother, have been used by others to sell drugs. They are the ones that go out.' Sean Grainger, for Beaumont, said: 'Her position is she was simply passing on drugs so she could get drugs from people further up the chain.' Robert Mochrie, defending Ibbotson and Hutchinson, said both his clients accepted they faced an immediate jail term and asked for credit for their early guilty pleas. Judge Peter Armstrong jailed Beaumont and Leonard for two-and-a-half years and Ibbotson for three-and-a-half years. Hutchinson was sent to a young offenders' institution for two-and-a-half years. The judge said: 'This sort of drug dealing results in immediate custodial sentences. 'As has been said, the main mitigation, if not the only mitigation, is you pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity and, as such, you are entitled to a third from the sentence.' After the hearing Detective Constable Max Leonard, of the Stockton drugs unit, said: 'This gang who blighted the streets of Stockton by dealing drugs from back alleys were caught following an intelligence-led operation. 'All information received from the public is acted upon, and we would ask those with information on drugs in their area to contact police on 101 or call the charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555111.'","Terry .

These were the claims of Matias Duarte, Google's Director of Android User Experience talking at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. He said the ability to to make objects more 'tangible' will be the next major development in mobile technology. Google executive Matias Duarte said the mobile phones of the future will be make objects more 'tangible' for users . 'Computers have to work the way people expect and not the other way round,' he told CNN. Google's free Android software has roughly 70 per cent of the world's smartphone market and is used on handsets such as the HTC (pictured) and Samsung . 'I want everything can you touch on the screen to operate like objects in the real world do. 'That doesn't mean they have to look like copies of objects in the real world, but they have to be tangible and physical and delightful.' Duarte said users' experience of mobile phones has been transformed by being able to 'stroke' screens. 'In the old days we used to be poking at phones,' he said. 'If I were to start poking you, you wouldn't like it, but when you start stroking, it's a totally different message. 'Right now we only recognize a couple of fingers, and on screens that are small and always in the palm of your hand. 'In the future, we will look at the gestures of your entire body, facial expressions, arms, all of the fingers that you have, and you're going to have screens not just in the palm of your hand, but all around you.' Duarte's team is also believed to be involved in the development of Google's Glass wearable computer. It will go on sale later this year for under £100, and will offer a way to give consumers the 'virtual reality' experience Duarte referred to. The glasses use voice recognition, but also have a trackpad on one arm to negotiate menus . Google's Android software was used on almost 70 per cent of mobile phones and tablets sold in 2012. But Mozilla, makers of the popular Internet software Firefox, is preparing to take on Google, and Apple with its iOS software, in the summer.

A hardened core of 100,000 criminals convicted last year already had at least 15 offences to their names. This group of serial offenders is growing and now contains more than one in three of all criminals coming before the courts. Worryingly, official figures show that less than four in ten were sent to jail last year, despite their lengthy criminal records. The number of offenders with such prolific records has shot up by more than 50 per cent in a decade. In 2002 they were responsible for less than one in five crimes annually and numbered some 64,000. But by last year that proportion was 33 per cent – a record high – and their numbers topped 103,000. They carry out over a quarter of all violent crimes, more than 40 per cent of burglaries and one in five drugs offences, according to the Ministry of Justice which published the figures yesterday. The findings prompted demands for tougher jail terms to ensure the public is protected from unrepentant criminals. Peter Cuthbertson, director of the Centre for Crime Prevention think-tank said: ‘This suggests we could cut crime dramatically by locking up more serious, repeat offenders. ‘They are the ones who are responsible for a fast-growing percentage of all crimes. ‘Unfortunately the number of prison places hasn’t kept pace at all with the number of serious, repeat offenders, and last year only one in four serious offences led to a prison sentence.’ Out of court warnings, penalties and cautions, September 2002 to September 2012 . Offenders receiving an indeterminate custodial sentence and average custodial sentence length for all offenders; September 2002 to September 2012 . A detailed breakdown of offending published yesterday showed the shocking annual toll on the public of the country’s most prolific criminals. A total of 311,286 offenders were convicted last year for indictable – or serious – offences. A prolific burglar carried out  nearly 100 offences during an eight-year crime spree. Kenny Ward, pictured, pleaded guilty to two counts of residential burglary earlier this month and was jailed for three years. But the court also heard the shocking extent of his criminal past which was taken into account. Croydon Crown Court was told he admitted to police a further 92 offences dating back to 2005, each of which was a similar break-in or act of thievery. In addition, he already has 20 previous convictions on top of those crimes. The 42-year-old from Croydon targeted homes in his home town, Bromley and Sutton in south London. He stole expensive iPads and laptop computers, as well as jewellery including wedding rings and other items of sentimental value. The court heard he sold the goods and used the money to fund his drug habit. His previous convictions include burglary, theft and forced entry into premises. The offences include violent crimes, sex crimes, burglary, robbery and drug offences as well as more serious motoring offences. A decade ago, in 2002, prolific offenders with 15 or more previous crimes were responsible for 19.4 per cent of all serious crimes – some 64,600 individual offences. By 2007 the proportion rose to one in four and their crimes numbered 78,000. But last year they made up one in three of all criminals coming before the courts – a total of 103,035. They were responsible for around 12,500 violent attacks, 10,200 burglaries and 52,000 acts of thievery or handling stolen goods. In addition, they carried out 13,250 drug crimes, more than 500 sex offences and around 8,000 uncategorised offences. Despite their lengthy records, just 39 per cent were jailed on the spot, while the remainder were given community sentences, suspended jail terms, fines or lesser punishments. By contrast, the number of first-time offenders is falling sharply. There were 187,700 offenders with no existing record caught last year, a fall of 12 per cent in a year and down more than 40 per cent in five years. Positive signs include a fall in the number of cautions issued by the police – down 12 per cent in a year to 205,700. Ministers defended the figures, pointing to sharp falls in crime in recent years. Justice Minister Jeremy Wright said: ‘Crime is falling and the use of cautions is now at its lowest level for over a decade. ‘A greater proportion of convicted criminals are going to prison and their sentences are longer than ever before. ‘However, reoffending rates have barely changed in a decade and we cannot go on doing the same thing and expecting a different result. ‘That is why we are pressing ahead with major reforms that will tackle this problem.’ Caged: Average sentence lengths have jumped sharply in the last ten years .","Ministry of Justice figures show worrying rise in hardened criminals .

An evil father-in-law who imprisoned his son’s Pakistani bride as a sex slave has been jailed – after his victim learned enough English to call police and beg for help. The depraved 56-year-old stripped the bride of her jewellery and passport after she came to Britain following an arranged marriage, a court heard. He made her swear on the Koran that she would keep the abuse a secret and promised to heap shame on her by forcing her to divorce his son if she refused his demands for sex. But after more than three months of abuse, she summoned the little English she had picked up and called 999 at dead of night to plead with the police for help. Her life was such unbearable misery that she contemplated suicide, Bradford Crown Court heard, after her husband effectively abandoned her at his parents' home. The defendant, from Bradford, West Yorkshire, subjected the 22-year-old to ‘repeated and sustained’ sexual abuse, scratching her arm with a screwdriver and burning her with an iron to reinforce his authority over her, the court heard. Prosecutor Richard Clews said he told her not to wear underwear to make the abuse easier. He molested her when his wife was out, after locking the house doors. The man, who cannot be named to protect the identity of his victim, made his victim do the housework, care for his grandchildren and bring him breakfast in bed. Mr Clews said the bride spoke no English when she came to the UK in 2008, aged 18, following an arranged marriage. Her husband stayed out late and then stopped coming back to his parents’ home at all, leaving his bride under the power and control of her father-in-law. Anguish: Bradford Crown Court heard harrowing details of the crimes against the 22-year-old Pakistani bride committed by her father-in-law . Jailing him for seven years, Judge Jonathan Durham Hall QC told the man: ‘She was your prisoner and slave in your home.’ He added: ‘The slavery turned into repeated, sustained sexual abuse and degradation.’ The man forced her to watch pornography and physically hurt her with his ‘unfaithful and disgusting activity’. The judge praised the woman’s bravery . and commended Detective Constable Sharon Larkin, of West Yorkshire . Police, for her work on the case. The man pleaded guilty to sexual . assault, between May 1 and August 12, 2010, causing his victim to engage . in sexual activity against her will causing her actual bodily harm. After the case, DC Larkin said: ‘West . Yorkshire Police treat all sexual offences extremely seriously and with . the utmost integrity. ‘This was a particularly sensitive . case in which the victim was subject to sexual, physical and mental . abuse over a sustained period. ‘This man abused his position of trust . to inflict horrendous acts upon her and I would applaud this woman for . having the courage to come forward.’","Evil 56-year-old made his victim swear on the Koran that she would keep the abuse secret .

The 44million attacks a year against home computers, businesses and government are thought to cost the country up to £27billion. The most common form of attack involves malicious software targeting computers, credit card fraud and hacking of social networking sites. Hacking of financial details and social media accounts are the most common problems . But a shortage of IT workers is hampering Britain’s ability to protect itself from costly internet attacks, a National Audit Office report revealed. Worryingly, the lack of classroom computer and technology skills mean it could be two decades before the gap is closed. The spending watchdog found the number of IT and cyber security professionals in the UK has not increased in line with the growth of the internet. Its report into the UK’s cyber security strategy revealed concerns in academia, business and government about the low uptake of computer science and technology courses. In 2010 ministers dramatically upgraded the Government’s assessment of the threat from electronic attack, which now rates as one of the top four risks to the UK. Over four years from 2011 an additional £650 million will be spent on the National Cyber Security Programme. The report also revealed low levels of security awareness among many computer users. According to a survey the top three passwords are ‘password’ ‘123456’ and ‘12345678’. It is estimated that around eight in ten attacks could be prevented with better passwords and basic computer security. Previous hacking victim: a student committed a series of cyber attacks as part of hacking group Anonymous that cost the website PayPal £3.5 million . NAO head Amyas Morse said: ‘The threat to cyber security is persistent and continually evolving. ‘Business, government and the public must constantly be alert to the level of risk if they are to succeed in detecting and resisting the threat of cyber-attack.’ The report said: ‘Interviews with government, academia and business representatives confirmed that the UK lacks technical skills and that the current pipeline of graduates and practitioners would not meet demand. ‘A number of government departments commented that the UK depended on a small number of highly skilled people to participate in developing international technical standards.’ ‘Interviewees were concerned about a lack of promotion of science and technology subjects at school resulting in the reported lower uptake of computer science and technology courses by UK students.’","Many British computer users leave themselves vulnerable with the .

"By . Jack Doyle and Emma Reynolds . PUBLISHED: . 21:04 EST, 31 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:19 EST, 1 February 2013 . The police complaints commission today admitted that only 21 out of 8,000 corruption allegations against officers had been investigated, as a damning assessment of the watchdog's shortcomings was published. Chairwoman Dame Anne Owers said she did not have the resources to do more, after a report by MPs attacked the organisation as ‘woefully under-equipped and hamstrung'. More than 200 officers a year are escaping disciplinary charges by retiring or resigning, the report warned. Staggeringly, last year nearly one in every four officers was subject of a complaint, amounting to a total of 31,771 in England and Wales. Lacking resources: Chairwoman Dame Anne Owers admitted that the IPCC is under-resourced, as MP Keith Vaz said it is 'woefully under-equipped' to do its job . But in a scathing report, the Home Affairs Select Committee warns of a public suspicion that ‘police are getting away with misconduct and criminality’ because the Independent Police Complaints Commission cannot get to the truth. 'We need more resources and we need more powers,' Dame Owers said today. 'We cannot do the job the public expect us to be able to do.' But solicitor Raju Bhatt argued that the IPCC was failing to make 'effective use of the powers and the resources that they already have', on Radio 4 this morning. He said that what was needed a 'change in culture'. Of 8547 corruption allegations, 837 were referred to the IPCC, 21 investigated, 18 prosecuted and just 13 found guilty. Serious cases of police corruption are ‘under-investigated’ the report says, as the IPCC concentrates on less serious accusations. Committee chairman Keith Vaz said the IPCC was insulting victims by just ‘scratching the surface’ of serious alleged abuses. Evidence: The committee made their conclusions after hearing from witnesses such as Doreen Lawrence, left, who said she had 'no confidence' in the IPCC and examining the case of PC Simon Harwood, who 'retired' before he was disciplined for attacking newspaper vendor Ian Tomlinson . He warned of a ‘complaints roundabout’ where cases are first investigated internally by the accused force, but . are then appealed to the IPCC because the complainant is unhappy. The . report revealed that one in three such cases is overturned by the IPCC . because of failures in the initial investigation. As a result, the IPCC . was ‘overloaded’ with appeal cases, MPs said. Committee . chairman Keith Vaz said: ‘When public trust in the police is tested by . complaints of negligence, misconduct and corruption, a strong watchdog . is vital to get to the truth - but the IPCC leaves the public frustrated . and faithless.’ He added: . ‘Nearly a quarter of officers were subject to a complaint last year. Many were trivial, but some were extremely serious, involving deaths in . custody or corruption -it is an insult to all concerned to do no more . than scratch the surface of these alleged abuses. ‘The . IPCC investigated just a handful and often arrived at the scene late, . when the trail had gone cold. The Commission is on the brink of letting . grave misconduct go uninvestigated.’ The . IPCC is currently investigating the Hillsborough disaster in what . investigators say is the biggest ever inquiry into police misconduct, . during which it will be given new powers and additional funding. MPs took evidence from victims of police misconduct, their lawyers, police representatives and ministers. Doreen Lawrence, the mother of Stephen Lawrence, told the committee she had ‘no confidence in [the commission] whatsoever’. The committee recommended that IPCC investigators should take ‘immediate control’ of an investigation of serious injury or death involving police officers. Serious corruption cases - including evidence tampering - should automatically land with the IPCC instead of a force’s internal complaints department. They also concluded that the IPCC needed a legal power to require a force to implement its recommendations after something goes wrong. During the investigation of the death of newspaper vendor Ian Tomlinson, it emerged that the police officer who attacked him, PC Simon Harwood, had ducked ten complaints by switching forces, including a road-rage attack, racial abuse and a series of heavy-handed arrests. He ‘retired’ from the Met on medical grounds on the eve of a disciplinary hearing, only to rejoin within days on its civilian staff. After transferring to a separate force, Surrey, he then returned to the Met in 2005 as a police officer. IPCC chairman Dame Anne Owers backed the call for more resources and powers. She said: ‘This report recognises that we do not yet have the resources or powers to do all that the public rightly expects and needs from us. That is what we have been saying for a long time. ‘Without that, we will continue to struggle to meet the legitimate expectations of complainants and of families who have lost someone in tragic circumstances.’","Damning assessment of Independent Police Complaints Commission .

Instead of getting married today, the fiancé of double Olympic women's soccer gold medalist Hope Solo appeared in court this afternoon accused of striking her in a domestic dispute at their home in Seattle. Former Seahawks tight end Jerramy Stevens, 33, was arrested at 3.45 a.m. on Monday for the fourth-degree assault of Hope, 31,  after an altercation involving a number of people which left the controversial soccer star nursing a cut elbow. According to the police report, Stevens was taken into custody after officers were called by Solo's older brother Marcus, who had used a 'stun gun' to fight off a group of men who were not invited to a party at the house. Scroll Down for Video . Former Seattle Seahawks player Jerramy Stevens, (rear), listens during a bail hearing Municipal Court in Kirkland, Washington on Tuesday, Nov. 13, 2012. He was released without conditions by the judge who didn't find probable cause to hold him . After appearing in front of the Kirkland Municipal Court judge today, Stevens, who has a long list of run-ins with the police, was released after no evidence was produced connecting Stevens to any assault during the fracas. Also in court to witness her fiancé was U.S. women's soccer team goalkeeper Hope Solo, who had allegedly already been uncooperative with King County Police regarding the incident and declined to give comment after the legal proceedings. Solo appeared in the courtroom Tuesday afternoon, but left without saying anything to reporters, according to KING-TV. A . call to a number listed for Stevens in court documents rang unanswered. A message left at a listed number for Solo was not immediately . returned. Stevens, 33, and Solo, 31, applied for a marriage license Thursday, according to King County records.

The two, who have been in a relationship for two months, were set to get . married Tuesday and argued over whether to live in Washington or . Florida after their marriage, according to court documents. Police in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland responded to a disturbance at a . home around 3:45 a.m. Monday involving a physical altercation between . eight people during a party, said Kirkland police Lt. Mike Murray. He . said officers contacted several people in the home who appeared . intoxicated and didn't cooperate with police, but determined based on . information and observations that there was probable cause to arrest . Stevens for investigation of fourth-degree assault. Murray didn't . identify the alleged victim, but court records show it was Solo, who . received a cut to her elbow. Court documents show that Solo's . 36-year-old brother, Marcus, called 911, and that he and Solo told . officers there was a party and blamed the disturbance on two to three . unknown men who were at the party. Marcus Solo told police he used a . stun gun on one of the men, who left the party before police arrived, . according to court records. According to court documents, a police officer found Stevens, “who . appeared to be hiding,” lying between the bed and the wall in an . upstairs bedroom. Stevens told officers he was sleeping on the floor and . didn't hear the fight. The officer saw signs of a fight, and dried . blood on Stevens' shirt. The officer noted in his affidavit for . probable cause for arrest that he arrested Stevens based on his . admission that he argued with Hope Solo, the injury to her elbow, signs . of a fight in the bedroom where Stevens was found and blood on Stevens' shirt. One 32-year-old woman was taken to the hospital for . treatment of a hip injury, and another man suffered multiple bumps, . scrapes and contusions, Murray said. 'If officers find that an . assault may have taken place, then we have to make an arrest on who we . determine is the primary aggressor,' Murray said. He was mostly a first-round bust with the Seahawks, except for the 2005 season when he started a career-high 12 games and had 45 receptions as the Seahawks won the NFC championship. Hope Solo (centre left) and Jerramy Stevens (centre right) pose for an Instagram picture last month . His run-ins with the law weren't done when he left college. Stevens was arrested on reckless driving charges in 2003 in a Seattle suburb and in 2007 when he was charged with driving under the influence in Scottsdale, Ariz. Stevens' most recent arrest came in 2010, while he was playing for Tampa Bay, when he was arrested the night before a game for possession of marijuana. He was almost immediately released by the team. Controversial soccer star Hope Solo has a history of high profile run-ins with authority and even with her own team-mates. In August, extracts from her latest autobiography book revealed the frustration she felt after the clique of older players within the U.S. women's soccer team suspended her for comments she made after being benched in favour of veteran goalkeeper Briana Scurry in 2007. Hope Solo celebrates after defeating Japan by a score of 2-1 to win the Women's Football gold medal match at Wembley Stadium in August . The outspoken two-time Olympic champion's book, 'Solo: A Memoir of Hope', gives the 31-year-old's version of events after she described the decision to replace her for the United States' 4-0 defeat at the hands of Brazil 'the wrong decision'. Detailing a dramatic and aggressive confrontation with the heroes of the 1999 World Cup winning U.S. team following her comments, Solo, who was 26-years-old at the time reveals she was made to publicly apologise twice before her teammates took the decision to kick her off the team during the tournament in China. Originally in the starting 11 for the 2007 World Cup, Solo was relegated to the bench after a series of poor performances during the United States' run to the semi-final match against the Brazilians. Replaced by Briana Scurry, then 36-years-old, who had acted as Solo's mentor during her time in the soccer set-up, the flamboyant goalkeeper spoke to the media after the defeat to explain why coach Greg Ryan had made 'the wrong decision.' Former Seattle Seahawks tight end Jerramy Stevens speaks with the media in Detroit, Michigan in this file photo . In the hours following her comments, Solo claims that she did not for-see any problems with what she had said. However, upon arrival to their hotel in Shanghai, Solo was summoned to the hotel room of team captain Kristine Lilly, who was waiting for her with other so-called veterans of the 1999 World Cup victory. 'It was our team captain Kristine Lilly. She said the veterans wanted to talk to me and asked if I would come to their room,' explained Solo in her memoir. 'I walked down the hall. By now it was after midnight. I pushed open the door of Lil's room and saw the veterans grimly waiting for me. Kate Markgraf stood by the door. Lil, Shannon Boxx, Christie Pearce Rampone, Abby, and Bri sat on the beds. 'I walked across to the other side of the room and leaned against the wall. 'They had seen the interview. I was told that I had, in their opinion, basically committed treason.'Describing the expletive filled lecture she received from the older players, Solo revealed that experienced defender Kate Markgraf walked out on the meeting saying 'I can't even f***ing look at you.' Solo reveals in her book that she found this to be 'overly dramatic.' 'They told me that you don't throw a teammate under the bus, that I had broken the code, that I had betrayed the team,' said Solo. Fun!

Tragedy: Tycoon Morten Hoegh's daughter Alexandra, 3, was found hanged in her cot after getting tangled in blind cords . The daughter of one of  Britain’s richest men has died after becoming tangled in the cords of a window blind. The three-year-old was found  in her cot at the London home  of Norwegian shipping tycoon Morten Hoegh. Alexandra Lucy Hoegh was discovered by her mother Dana, 37, at their £12million house in West London. Detectives are investigating but are not treating the death as suspicious. It is thought that Alexandra was playing with the strings in her cot and became caught up, resulting in her being hanged by the cords. Paramedics were called to the semi-detached property shortly after 2.25pm on Monday. The toddler was taken to  hospital but pronounced dead at 3.17pm. Her American-born mother was taken to hospital  in shock. Mr Hoegh, 39, is the chairman of Hoegh LNG, a multi-billion pound oil and gas shipping company based in Norway. He is one of Britain’s richest men with an estimated fortune of £175million.The couple also have two other children, a six-year-old son and a daughter, five. Relatives at the family home yesterday were too upset to talk. Shocked neighbours described the Houghs as a ‘private family’ who had lived at the property for around five years. The increase in the number of deaths involving blind cords similar to this one has led to campaigners calling on them to be banned . ‘They are a very pleasant  couple, . very polite,’ said one resident. ‘You see them doing the school run, . either the mother or father or the nanny, but apart from that they are . very private. ‘People on this street tend to keep . themselves to themselves.’ A man, who did not want to be named, said he . was near the house when he heard screaming. He ran on to the street, . where he saw Mrs Hoegh outside her home. He called emergency services. ‘There was nothing they  could do,’ he said. ‘It is an  image I cannot get out of my head, I cannot sleep. It is a  horrible, horrible accident.’ Safety campaigners say at least 22 . children have died in similar accidents since 1999, ten of them in the . last two years. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents is . campaigning for manufacturers to stop making looped blind cords, which . they say pose an unacceptably high risk to infants. In the meantime, it wants cords fitted with safety devices such as chain-break connections. It advises parents against installing . blinds with cords, particularly in children’s bedrooms; to ensure any . cords are short and out of reach; and to not hang toys on cots.","Dana Hoegh, 37, found daughter Alexandra Lucy, in their West London home .

"By . Tim Shipman . UPDATED: . 13:35 EST, 23 December 2011 . Excessive credit card charges for online shopping will be banned under laws to be unveiled today. The hidden fees, which cost customers more than £300million a year, are imposed on flights, holidays and cinema and theatre tickets as well as by a range of other retailers. At present, firms are not allowed to put surcharges on debit card payments. Under plans drawn up by Chancellor George Osborne, that ban will be extended to all cards. Online: Charges which increase the cost of web shopping are to be banned under new Government measures . From the end of next year, almost all transactions will be covered. Companies which break the rules will be hit with multi-million pound fines. The Government decided to act after a damning report by the Office of Fair Trading earlier this year denounced the widespread use of card scams. It found evidence of companies using ‘drip pricing’ practices online – adding payment charges only after purchasers have filled in a number of web pages. They include health clubs, sports and music ticketing firms and even Government agencies such as the DVLA, which distributes driving licences. The report followed a campaign by the consumer rights group Which? It filed more than 50,000 complaints about rip-off card deals with the OFT. From mid-2014 an EU Consumer Rights Directive will ban businesses in many sectors, including airlines, from imposing above-cost surcharges on any form of payment. But Treasury minister Mark Hoban will . today announce a consultation to ban the practice nearly two years . early in Britain, by the end of 2012. Mr Hoban, the Financial Secretary to the . Treasury, said: ‘We want consumers to be able to shop around. They have . a right to understand the charges they may incur upfront and not be hit . through a hidden last-minute payment surcharge. Announcement: Minister Mark Hoban is launching a consultation about the charges . ‘We’re leading the way in Europe by stopping this practice. The Government remains committed to helping consumers get a good deal in these difficult times.’ Ministers also want to act against excessive ‘administration fees’ imposed when people shop online for flights, holidays, concert tickets and rail travel. For example, Ryanair imposes a £6 ‘administration fee’ on every customer for every flight, regardless of how payment is made, slapping a £12 return cost on tickets that often cost only a few pounds. This is a 1,400 per cent increase on the 80p it charged in 2004 for using a debit card. The only way to avoid the fee is to use Ryanair’s own-brand MasterCard prepay card called Cash Passport. Which? calculates that airline passengers pay out nearly £8million a month in surcharges every month, the equivalent of £265,000 a day. A senior Treasury source said: ‘We want this to go as wide as we can to prevent excessive charges.’ Under the plans, businesses will not be able to load on excessive payment surcharges. But they will be able to add a small charge to cover their real costs for using any particular form of payment. That is likely to cap credit card costs at a maximum of 2 per cent per transaction, or around 20p for a debit card payment. Airlines regularly charge 3 or 4 per cent for credit card payments. Ryanair: The budget airline has drawn criticism for its credit card policies, which attaches fees to most cards . Which? executive director, Richard Lloyd, welcomed the move and called for companies to act on it straight away. He said: ‘The Government’s decision to ban rip-off debit and credit card surcharges is a huge victory for consumers. More than 50,000 people supported the Which? campaign to see these fees stamped out. ‘This announcement goes further than the Office of Fair Trading’s proposals, finally putting an end to these unfair and excessive charges. ‘Given that airline passengers alone pay more than £265,000 a day in card surcharges, businesses shouldn’t drag their feet over this. While the law will come into force at the end of 2012, we want companies to be upfront and fair over card charges today.’ The Department of Business will finalise the new rules once the consultation is complete. Consumer Minister Edward Davey said: ‘We want to make sure that consumers paying by card do not have to pay the excessively high surcharges being imposed on them by some airlines and other businesses. ‘That is why we will consult on early implementation of the Consumer Rights Directive provision to protect consumers from excessively high credit and debit card charges.’ Ryanair made clear that it will fight Government attempts to hit its ‘administration fees’. A spokesman for the company said: ‘Ryanair, the UK’s favourite airline, confirms that it does not impose any debit or credit card fees.’","New rules will outlaw the practice of charging customers to use cards .

Last week when news of her new relationship broke, it seemed that Elin Nordegren had finally been able to move on from her traumatising divorce from Tiger Woods and had found happiness once again. But the 31-year-old's new romance has taken a shocking twist, after it was claimed that her boyfriend Jamie Dingman, had also allegedly enjoyed trysts with Tiger's former mistress, Rachel Uchitel. Elin is said to be fuming over the allegations, despite the businessman's denials. No escape? Elin Nordegren is understood to be furious of the allegations that her new boyfriend Jamin Dingman had an affair with Rachel Uchitel, former mistress of her ex-husband Tiger Woods . According to celebrity website TMZ, Jamie Dingman and Rachel Uchitel spent two and a half weeks together at the Miami home of his business partner Chris Barish in October 2009. At the time Dingman was in a relationship with a model named Inez. Friends of the wealthy investor has hit back at the claims, saying the Miss Uchitel is lying about the affair. But others have allegedly told TMZ: . 'Jamie came into Rachel's room late at night twice and the two hooked up . ... and they heard Rachel discussing it with Barish the morning after . each liaison.' Affairs: Jamie Dingman (right) allegedly enjoyed trysts with Uchitel while they both stayed at the home of his business partner Chris Barish (left) in October 2009 . TMZ also claims Rachel left Jamie when . things started to heat up with Tiger, but the wealthy investor wasn't . exactly broken up over the split and told Rachel: 'That's ok. I'll . date his wife, Elin.' In a further twist, at the time Barish allegedly was dating Jen Madden - the woman who sold the original story about Tiger's affairs to the National Enquirer. According to the website, Miss Madden obtained much of her information from overheard conversations between the group. Former model Elin has been quietly dating Dingman, the son of billionaire Michael Dingman, for several months. Mistress: Miss Uchitel allegedly spent two and a half weeks with Dingman, who was in a relationship at the time, and informed him of her affair with Tiger woods . He has . previously been linked to Princess Madeleine of Sweden and American . actress Bridget Moynahan. Jamie splits his time between China and the Bahamas where his father’s Shipston Group company is based. But despite his jet setting lifestyle, it appears he has still had time to visit Elin in her native Sweden. It has also been said the pair first met at the Red Cross Ball in Florida last January attended by Princess Madeleine. Battle: Uchitel, pictured in 2009 with her lawyer Gloria Allred, has returned most of the $10m 'hush money' she received after Wood's lawyers claimed she breached the agreement . Elin divorced golf ace Woods after it . emerged that he had been involved in a considerable number of . extra-martial affairs which came to light in December 2009. Although . she initially stood by him amidst the claims, she eventually filed for . divorce and the couple’s marriage ended in August 2010. The pair have two children together Sam, three, and two-year-old Charlie. Elin, who walked away with $100million as part of her . divorce settlement from Woods, is said to have been dating Jamie for months.

Rachel Uchitel was the first mistress to be outed, and was paid $10million in 'hush money' hours before she was set to hold a tell-all press conference. It has emerged that Uchitel has returned most of the money, after being threatened with a lawsuit by Woods' lawyer Jay Lavely, who claims she has violated the confidentiality agreement by speaking to media and also going on reality show Celebrity Rehab for treatment for her 'addiction to love'. Her lawyer Gloria Allred is said to have advised Rachel to return the money as she believed she would lose a . court case, but now Rachel is threatening Allred with a malpractice . suit.

Party: Jabbar Cambell, 32, claims a group of NYPD officers assaulted him after responding to a noise complaint about a gay pride party in his Brooklyn apartment . A Brooklyn man claims he was brutally beaten by a group of nine 'homophobic' police officers responding to a noise complaint at his gay pride party. Jabbar Cambell, 32, claims the NYPD officers burst into his eight-bedroom flat yelling 'fag' and 'f***ing homo', in what his lawyer has described as a 'hate crime'. Mr Cambell, a computer forensics investigator, is also claiming that the police tried to 'conceal evidence' by tampering with a video camera outside his property before they entered. After being left with a bloodied mouth and black eye, and having spent 24 hours in custody following the incident, Mr Campbell has now issued legal papers indicating he intends to sue the police. Recalling the incident, he said: 'They were yelling ‘you f***ing fag’ and . ‘homo'.' 'I couldn’t block the . blows. I was fighting to stay conscious [but] I was blacking out because . of the hits I was taking.' The alleged beating followed a call to police about excessive noise at Mr Cambell’s apartment on . Sterling Place in Crown Heights, where around 80 revelers had gathered. Two officers first arrived at the property at approximately 2:50 am where they told partygoers - some dressed in drag - to quieten down. After leaving, it is alleged another group of officers arrived 10 minutes later. The officers buzzed at the locked door — and one even reached out to disable the surveillance camera in the vestibule. Cambell claims he observed the police arriving through a surveillance camera, before he noticed a police officer disabling the camera. Scroll down for video . Belligerent: A police report claims Mr Cambell ignored their demands to 'discontinue a party' and then pushed an officer, before attempting to flee and acting 'belligerently¿ . He has provided a videotape that appears to show three officers standing outside the property before one of them reaches towards the camera. 'I noticed them turning the security camera and I got scared,' Mr Cambell told the New York Post. After ten minutes, Mr Cambell says he went to the door to let the officers in to the apartment, which takes up the entire second floor of the two-story building. He said: 'I opened the door and one officer . used his foot and arm to hold the door open. There was a . sergeant, he yelled ‘get him!’ and that’s when I got attacked. 'They kept saying ‘Stop . resisting’ but I wasn’t resisting. I didn’t have any time to respond.' Police claim Mr Cambell ignored their demands to 'discontinue a party' and then pushed an officer, before attempting to flee and acting 'belligerently’. Hotels are a particular concern. Police have worked closely with managers, urging them to guard against anyone who might seek to check into a guest room and use it to launch a sniper or other type of attack . Mr Cambell was later charged with resisting arrest, attempted assault and possession of marijuana. The alleged victim claims two officers held his . arms while another pushed his head forward, before a fourth officer repeatedly punched his face. He was later taken to Kings County Hospital for treatment before being held in custody for 24 hours. Mr Cambell claims he was paid $300 by a party planner to . host the gay pride party at his property, with guests paying a $5 entrance fee. His lawyer, Herb Subin, said the accused the police of 'screaming anti-gay epithets', describing the incident as a 'hate crime'.","Jabbar Cambell, 32, accuses officers of shouting 'fag' and 'homo' at party .

A 'heartbroken' family have just 24 hours to to flee their home over fears it is about to disappear into a 30ft crater. Mother of three Leah Coldham faces losing her home to a massive 30ft deep dene hole that has appeared in the front garden of their home in Grays, Essex. The crater, which is the remains of a cave dug out by Britons hiding from invading Danes in the 1st Century, first appeared as a small hole on Tuesday. The dene hole in Leah Coldham's garden first appeared on Tuesday morning . However it has since grown 35ft wide and 30ft deep, disrupting the Coldhams' gas and electricity. A spring has also appeared in the hole, with the water it is leaking causing the crater to widen even faster. Despite . round the clock efforts by the council and engineers to help the family . they have said that nothing can be done until it stops widening. Mrs Coldham, 44, has lived in the house with her husband and three children since buying it nine years ago. The family had a full survey done when they bought the house, but it failed to reveal any potential problems. And now they have been forced to take . down their Christmas decorations just days after putting them up and . have been given 24 hours to move their valuables from the stricken house. It has since swollen to a massive 30ft deep crater and forced the Coldhams to move home . Dene holes are underground structures formed of a number of small chalk caves accessed by a vertical shaft. hey date back to the 1st Century and are largely found in chalky ground in Kent and Essex along the lower banks of the River Thames.The holes are believed to have been dug by English fearful of an impending Danish invasion, hence their name.Historians say the chambers, which can be up to 60ft (20m) deep were also used to store grain and extract chalk. Describing the appearance of the . crater, Mrs Coldham said: 'It was first thing in the morning I noticed a . little hole, but over the day it got bigger and bigger. 'At the minute its about 30ft wide and 35ft deep. Because of this we have also had a spring appear so we have fresh water coming in and making the hole worse. 'It's probably about 7ft away from my house now and it will be closer in the morning - it just drops and drops. She added: 'We've been told we have 24 hours to pack up our belongings and get out of the house. 'I've never, ever heard of a dene hole before otherwise I wouldn't have moved into this area. 'I feel absolutely heart-broken. I . love my home and it's Christmas time as well. I have just put the . Christmas decorations up and now I have had to take them down. 'We are staying in a hotel tonight . and trying to look for some accommodation at the minute but it's hard to . find somewhere to move straight away. ' Mrs Coldham had a full survey done when she bought the house - but it failed to uncover the danger . The collapse at the Coldham family home comes after a front garden disappeared in nearby Marlborough Close in October. Emergency engineers were called to the Thames-side crater, with the National Grid confirming that there had been at least one gas leak. Thurrock Council said they were taking 'all necessary precautionary measures' regarding the dene hole, which has been fenced off. Another dene hole appeared in nearby Marlborough Avenue, Grays in October . Ancient maps show the affected housing estate was built on more than 60 deep holes, most of which are 30ft below ground. But there is no information on why the council allowed homes to be built on such a vulnerable location in the first place. And infrastructure experts warned there was little that could be done to prevent future collapses. National Grid spokesman Raymond Miller said: 'We take problems like this incredibly seriously.' 'It’s not just us who will be affected by this. 'Electrics will be affected. Water will be affected. 'It would be very difficult to put anything preventative in place if the holes have been around for hundreds of years.' Alistair Baker, from Essex and Suffolk Water, echoed his views, saying: 'There’s very little we can do because you don’t know when or where it’s going to happen.' Despite the best efforts of engineers nothing can be done until the holes stop widening . Leading geologist Peter Allen, 72, from Cheshunt, Waltham Abbey, is a former president of the Essex Field Club, based in the en Centre, in Wat Tyler Park, Basildon. He claims Thurrock’s deneholes have been mapped out by the club, which has researched and recorded the county’s biology and geology since 1860. Mr Allen said: 'Teams of geologists have mapped out deneholes in that area, especially Grays, but a few may have slipped under the radar when studies were undertaken 50 years ago. 'One or two may have escaped our attention and we would love to found out more. 'I find it peculiar that the latest holes have been in people’s front gardens because they can be found anywhere, even under someone’s home. 'Those reporting a denehole should contact their local authority. They would be interested for both historical and safety reasons.' The dene holes can disrupt gas, electricity and water, and force families out of their homes . Dr Matt Pope, researcher of at Institute of Archaeology, called for improved mapping of deneholes as a ‘high priority’. He said: 'Deneholes are artificial caves and can be dangerous if they collapse and need to be made safe. 'They are poorly understood and there are many good reasons to investigate them but we need more archaeologists to be interested in them or engineers to carry out surveys if they are building homes and roads. 'Mapping them is important for an engineering and safety point of view and should be a high priority. 'Engineers should be working with local authorities to develop a better understand of the distribution of deneholes and to access the risk to infrastructure and housing.' Thurrock Council said it was taking 'all necessary precautionary measures.'","Ancient first century Dene hole threatens to swallow the Coldham family's Essex home .

Tens of thousands of rush hour train passenger were left stranded or facing major delays tonight when services on one of Britain’s busiest rail routes were 'massively' disrupted because of damaged power lines. Rail bosses say they will be working through the night and beyond to fix the problem on the East Coast mainline linking London to Edinburgh as the great Christmas getaway begins. And they urged those who could to camp out in the capital signalling that the delays are expected to last well into Tuesday with no guarantee they would be fully fixed by then. Chaos: Rail commuters face massive delays and even being stranded in London because of huge problems with the East Coast Main Line . Wait: Services between King's Cross and Peterborough face severe delays and cancellations . Train operator East Coast cancelled all trains out of London King’s Cross and ran diversionary train and replacement bus services to the North after electric power lines near Hitchin were mysteriously damaged. It said bluntly: ’No East Coast trains will run between London Kings Cross and Peterborough.’ It was unclear last night what had caused the damage with Network Rail 'ruling nothing out' and putting all its energy into solving the problem. It did not believe sabotage was to blame but could not give a conclusive reason. National Rail said at least 14 'droppers' - part of the overhead wire - have been broken and contact wires damaged, causing further damage to passing trains. The failure caused all services from the South – leaving London at a rate of up to four an hour - to be cancelled and forced services from the North to end at Peterborough subject to diversions or replacement buses. The train company urged passengers who could spend the night in the capital – either in a hotel or with friends – to do so. In the early hours of Tuesday morning, the East Coast Main Line Twitter feed stated: 'Repair work is being carried out overnight and it is hoped that a normal service will be running at that time.' Restrictions on tickets were lifted to allow commuters to delay their trip or switch to other operators where possible as an emergency measure to try and help passengers get to their destinations – though this did lead to severe delays. Three of the four lines around Hitchin were initially out of action from 2.45pm – causing rush hour chaos as commuters tried to get home. A third line was re-opened at around 6.45pm but Network Rail stressed there would be ‘very limited services.’ In the dark: Commuters wait for news after mysterious damage to electric power lines near Hitchin, Hertfordshire, severely affected East Coast trains . Uncertainty: Travellers try to get information from rail staff as train services are crippled in one of the busiest periods of the year . Commuters could use alternate routes but this increased the burden on other train services, causing further delays . Commuter Will North works in advertising in London and was trying to get home to Grantham in Lincolnshire. He could not get a train until nearly 10pm. He said: 'I got onto an earlier train and, after sitting there for a while was told it couldn't go because there was no train guard. 'I don't see how a downed power line has resulted in a shortage of guards. I would have done it if they asked.' East Coast did put on some diesel trains to divert passengers where possible but as a spokesman said: 'No trains are leaving Kings Cross.' Both network rail and East Coast described the problem as a being 'major' and 'massive'. A Network Rail spokesman said: 'This is one of the busiest lines in Britain and one of the two main arteries between London and Scotland. So it is a massive problem. Rail chiefs advised commuters to seek accommodation in London if possible, as the repair work is expected to continue throughout tonight and beyond . He continued: 'It will not be fixed quickly. We will be working through the night. Our priority is to get things moving again.' As well as East Coast, other train companies affected by the electric power cable damage were First Capital Connect, Grand Central and First Hull Trains . All routes through Stevenage were affected. The rail firm told passengers: 'Overhead wire problems are causing disruption between Stevenage and Hitchin.' Damage: Malfunctioning electrical power lines near Hitchin in Hertfordshire (pictured) have caused the travel disruption . It noted: 'Journeys between London Kings Cross, Moorgate, Peterborough and Cambridge may be delayed by up to three hours.' East Coast announced reduced services between Letchworth Garden City and Cambridge. Between Stevenage and Hitchin and Letchworth Garden City passengers were urged to use buses. Buses also ran between Stevenage and Luton Airport Parkway and also between Hatfield and St Albans (to connect with First Capital Connect Thameslink trains). Powerless: Hitchin train station (pictured) is on the East Coast Main Line, a major arterial route for train services from London to the North . It added: 'First Hull Trains are only running between Doncaster and Hull.' East . Coast passengers were told their tickets would be accepted by . CrossCountry trains ‘on reasonable routes’, on East Midlands Trains . services between London St Pancras International and Sheffield / Leeds . and also between Peterborough, Grantham and Nottingham. Motorists seeking to get away on the . roads this week still face 98 miles of roadworks – despite efforts to . finish or lift the bulk of them. Lane . restrictions or temporary speed limits will need to remain in place at . 19 locations for the safety of drivers and their passengers, said the . Highways Agency. These . include on the M3 near Camberley,  the M4 near Reading, the M25 near . Godstone and various sections of the M62 near Doncaster. The . Highways Agency said it will be clearing more than nine out of ten . roadworks for the holiday period, with plans in place to complete more . than 250 miles of roadworks on England’s motorways and major A roads by . the end of this week. A further 57 miles will be suspended between . December 21 and January 2 2013. They would also be taken on First TransPennine Express trains between Manchester Piccadilly and York and also between Sheffield and Doncaster, as well as Virgin Trains services between London Euston and Scotland and also between London Euston and Manchester. East Coast added: ‘Passengers who decide not to travel today may use their tickets tomorrow (Tuesday).’ The website added: 'First Capital Connect passengers may use Greater Anglia trains to and from Cambridge, London Underground services on reasonable routes and Uno buses on reasonable routes. ‘First Hull Trains passengers may use East Midlands Trains, First TransPennine Express, Northern Rail and Virgin Trains services on reasonable routes. 'Passengers should travel tomorrow instead if possible.’ And it added: ’Grand Central passengers may use CrossCountry, East Coast, Greater Anglia and London Underground services on reasonable routes and East Midlands Trains services between London and Sheffield / Leeds.

Arrested: Angel Garcia, 55, pictured, has been arrested after he allegedly abducted Brooklyn Gittins, 13, last week . A 55-year-old Utah man has been arrested after he allegedly abducted a 13-year-old girl who vanished from her home last week without shoes or a coat and emerged two days later unharmed. Salt Lake County Sheriff James Winder described Angel Garcia, from Draper, as a predator in the 'complicated' case of Brooklyn Gittins, who disappeared overnight on January 8 wearing just her pajamas. After an extensive search stretching two days and involving more than 1,000 volunteers, the young Herriman girl called her grandmother from a Wal-Mart store and police picked her up. Garcia was taken into custody on . Wednesday night and is being held at Salt Lake County Jail on suspicion . of child kidnapping, harboring a runaway, obstructing justice and child . endangerment. Winder . wouldn't give details about how Garcia knew Brooklyn, but told the Salt . Lake City Tribune there was 'an association between common friends.' He said police were not looking for any other suspects, and cautioned against speculation about the victim. 'I . don't want to characterize young Brooklyn's actions here, and I don't . think anybody else should either,' Winder told the newspaper. 'What . we have to look at here is the suspect, who has in no uncertain terms . behaved in a predatory fashion relative to a young member of our . community.' Found: Brooklyn Gittins, 13, who went missing . Tuesday night after going to bed in her house, was found unharmed, police said Friday . Scene: Police say there is no sign of forced entry at her home in Herriman, Utah . The sheriff reiterated that the 13-year-old was not physically harmed during the alleged abduction. He . said that Garcia was aware of the wide-spread hunt for Brooklyn while . she was missing and that there was a 'significant' amount of . premeditation involved in the plan. It's still unclear where Garcia . allegedly took Brooklyn. 'The locations are still being tracked down, but we believe there were several,' Winder told the Tribune. Police revealed last Friday that Brooklyn Gittins had been found unharmed. More to the story: Police suspect that Brooklyn, pictured, was harbored by Angel Garcia and are trying to find out where she was kept . Brooklyn . telephoned her grandmother late on Thursday night from a Wal-Mart store . in South Jordan, Unified Police spokesman Lieutenant Justin Hoyal said. The grandmother then contacted police and officers located the child. 'Brooklyn was not injured and is . fine,' Hoyal said last week. 'She was still wearing the grey T-shirt and . black pajama pants. She did not have on shoes, a coat.' Authorities were quick to suspect that the teen was harbored by someone and immediately focused on identifying that person. She disappeared on Tuesday evening wearing only pajamas and a t-shirt. It was not be the first time that Brooklyn ran away so her parents feared that she had done so again. A . major snowstorm on Thursday prompted some 1,000 volunteers to join . police in searching 17 square miles in the area near the girl's home in . Herriman, a Salt Lake City suburb about 18 miles southwest of downtown. A . key concern had been the frigid winter weather. 'Investigators believed . she could have been a victim of the elements; it's been extremely . cold,' he said. The storm was expected to dump as much as 7 inches of snow and bring freezing temperatures. Police, who used canine units, a . helicopter, and on-the-ground volunteers to canvas the nearby areas to find Brooklyn, interviewed the child after she was found, trying to determine where she was. There were no signs of forced entry at the Herriman home where Brooklyn was last seen at bedtime on Tuesday. 'We believe she left her home through her bedroom window and was picked up and harbored by a person or persons,' Hoyal told The Associated Press in an interview. Winder said on Thursday before she was found that the circumstances surrounding the case concerned authorities, especially because it appeared her departure was unplanned. Search: Unified firefighter Chris Thurman points out a meeting point to Christi Green and other volunteers before they leave to help search for 13-year-old Brooklyn Gittins last Thursday . Brooklyn's grandfather Craig Hiller made a plea at the news conference for her to come back. He said she's a typical teenage girl who is very outgoing in some cases and very subdued in others. The first time she ran away, she came back a short while later, Hiller said. He said at the time that he could not think of any clear . reason why she would have run away. There were no arguments in their . family of late and her friends did not know of any plans that she had to . disappear, he said. To many locals, the search for Brooklyn had echoes of . Elizabeth Smart's horrific 2002 kidnapping, which took place nearly 30 . miles away. However, that abduction had a clear suspect. Fortunately for her and her family, Brooklyn did not endure the same fate. 'This was a successful investigation and we appreciate all the efforts by the community, public safety personnel, and the media in response to Brooklyn's disappearance,' Hoyal said.","Angel Garcia in custody on suspicion of child kidnapping, harboring a runaway, obstructing justice and child .

A group of super-slimmers in Essex have shed the equivalent weight of an African elephant in just 12 months. The staggering bulk - 925 stone, or nearly six tonnes - was lost after members of a weight loss group in Braintree decided to change their eating habits in 2012. The 200-strong group lost, on average, 4.5 stone each, but married couple Simon and Tracy . Bartlett, 34 and 43, were the group's most successful slimmers, dropping 15 stone between them in just 18 months. 'I feel fantastic': Simon and Tracy Bartlett lost 15 stone between them at the slimming club after totally transforming their diet, taking up walking and gaining support from the group and each other . 'I was worried I wouldn't have the willpower': Simon and Tracy, pictured before they started dieting, say their experience of losing the weight helps them to support others . The 925 stone lost by the whole group is, in fact, the weight of a fully-grown African elephant - the largest land-living animal on the planet. Heidi Cripps, weight loss consultant for the successful Slimming World group in Braintree, Essex, explained the brand's weight-loss plan. She said: ‘Rather than the diet boxes or the shakes, they are encouraged to eat bread, potato, pasta, meat, fish, fruit and vegetables - the normal stuff. ‘For instance, people can still eat roast dinners, jacket potatoes and shepherd's pies. People fill up on good food so they don't tend to overeat on chocolate and snacks.' No more junk in the trunk: The slimming club in Braintree, Essex, are celebrating after shedding 925 stone - the weight of an African Elephant - in a year . She continued: ‘I am really proud of everyone in the . group - they've done it themselves. I turn up with the scales, but they . are the ones who put the effort in.' Impressive: Adult African elephants stand up to 3m tall and weigh between 4.4 and 7.7 tonnes . Mr Bartlett said that working to lose weight as part of a team with his wife Tracey was a big help, as there was always someone around who knew what you were going through. He said: ‘I was worried at first as I thought I may not have the willpower, . but once you reach your goal you think, ""I can do this"". ‘Doing it with someone else has been a massive help: we keep each other going. If one of us is having a bad day, the other is always there to give support. ‘We'd walk round the fields close to home, increasing the amount we were doing each day. Now we walk four miles a day, and on weekends up to 20. ‘Being out in the open air in the countryside is fantastic. Sometimes it really shows you what life is for. ‘We still go to Slimming World every week to help us stay on track, weigh in and of course to give others the encouragement we got. ‘It's a fantastic feeling helping others reach their targets.’","Simon and Tracy Bartlett, 34 and 43, lost 15 stone in 18 months .

But the 34-year-old mother-of-two resolved to slim down after breaking down in a changing room because she couldn't squeeze herself into a pair of size 18 jeans - and she has now lost over six stone and dropped to a size 10. Talking about her former diet, Sarah said: 'I would have sweet and sour . chicken, rice and chips from the Chinese almost every night and my . portions were big enough for four or five people. And Sarah is feeling so good about herself she is finally considering marrying her partner Mark, 46, who proposed nine years ago. Sarah and Mark, a construction projects manager, have been together 14 years and have two daughters, Becky, eight, and five-year-old Abi. But have never been married because Sarah could think of nothing worse than being a fat . bride., and was too embarrassed to wear a size 18 wedding dress. Talking about her former diet, Sarah said: 'I would have sweet and sour . chicken, rice and chips from the Chinese almost every night and my . portions were big enough for four or five people. 'The weight just slowly crept up on me . and I never used to dare go clothes shopping because I would spend so . much time crying. I just couldn't bear to put myself through it. 'I was in denial about my weight and told myself - this is who I am, I'm meant to be this size. But losing the weight has been the best thing I ever did - it's changed my life and I am a different person.' Breakfast: Five chocolate digestive biscuits and an Innocent smoothie . Lunch: Two sausage rolls, two pizza bread sticks and a char-grilled chicken baguette from Greggs and a can of Coca Cola. Dinner: Chinese takeaway – Sweet and sour chicken, egg fried rice, chips, prawn crackers and a bottle of rose wine . OR . Indian: Chicken tikka masala, fried rice, chips and a garlic naan. OR . Pizza: Large pepperoni . OR . Kebab: Doner or chicken kebab with chips, or battered sausage and chips . OR .

Sarah said: 'The weight just slowly crept up on me . and I never used to dare go clothes shopping because I would spend so . much time crying. I just couldn't bear to put myself through it' Sarah had been overweight for 10 years and at her biggest wore a size 24, but she always refused to admit that she had a problem. Although she knew people were talking about her size behind her back, she refused to accept that we was overweight. Sarah, who is 5'6'', said: 'Looking at . photos of myself made me depressed and I avoided scales because I was . not willing to accept that I had a problem.' She used to skip breakfast, gorge on chocolate, crisps and biscuits for lunch and then order takeaway four times a week. As well as her appearance, Sarah's . calorie intake was also having an effect on her health. It took her . fifteen minutes to get out of bed every day and she did no exercise at . all.

Snack: Banana, pear, pineapple, glass of fruit squash . Lunch: Either soup or a mixed layer salad with grated carrot, beetroot and ham, a Weight Watchers cereal bar and a packet of light crisps/Quavers, glass of fruit squash . Dinner: Chicken fajitas with mixed peppers and onions, glass of fruit squash . She said: 'Looking back now, it's . obvious why I was so overweight. I was a couch potato and would made . excuses not to take the kids to the park. 'I was too tired and embarrassed and I wouldn't even go on a night out. Every time I looked in the mirror, I would cry.' Sarah was so ashamed of her eating habits that she would binge eat Pringles and chocolates in secret. But after a decade of dodging mirrors, . avoiding clothes shops and dressing in plain, baggy clothes, Sarah . decided it was time to change her lifestyle. She signed up to a Weight Watchers class and lost six and a half pounds in the first week. Sine joining she has shrunk down to a size . 10 since, and is now so healthy . that she now leads her own class and teaches others how to beat the . bulge. She still has one takeaway each week but . will order from the Chinese and have half a portion of chicken chow . mein with extra beansprouts - and no rice or chips. Sarah began walking and jogging . and now runs three times a week to keep the weight off and tone her . body . Sarah said: 'When the woman told me I . weighed 17st 2.5lbs, I just laughed. I couldn't really believe I had let . it get that bad. It wasn't until I joined the group that I realised . just how fat I was. 'People always described me as a jolly . and bubbly person but all along I was just putting on a front, because . really I was depressed. 'I had an unhealthy relationship with food because to me, it was something to look forward to and it was a comfort.' Sarah went to weekly meetings and was . shocked to see the pounds melting away. She began walking and jogging . and now runs three times a week to keep the weight off and tone her . body. In just over a year Sarah has lost 6st . 1.5lbs and can now fit into a slim size 10. She said: 'All that time . and I was just pretending to be happy, but now I really am. 'Mine and Mark's relationship has improved so much and he is still getting used to the new me. 'After I lost a few stone Mark and I . went out a lot more. Someone who hadn't seen the new me asked Mark who . the woman he was with was, and if his wife would mind him going out with . her. 'That felt amazing and I am now a completely different person.' Sarah has become a YouTube sensation with her inspirational video, The Power of a Weight Watchers Meeting . Sarah loved being slim and healthy so much that she decided to become a Weight Watchers leader. She said: 'I never thought that I could do this, but I have proved myself wrong. I owe everything to the group. 'To people who want to lose weight but . are scared - never ever feel uncomfortable about the size that you are. There is something that you can do and someone who can help you.' Sarah has become a YouTube sensation with her inspirational video, The Power of a Weight Watchers Meeting.

Cryptic: Lance Armstrong has reportedly met with the US Anti-doping Agency to discuss 'a pathway to redemption' Disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong has . met with the US Anti-Doping Agency to discuss 'a pathway to redemption' following a report which cost him his seven Tour de France titles, it . has emerged. The head of the drugs authority Travis Tygart made the cryptic claim at the end of an interview with '60 Minutes Sport' last night. There was no further detail as to what this might mean or when and where a meeting was held. Speculation is rife that the shamed former cycling champion is ready to confess publicly that he consistently cheated throughout his career - having vehemently denied the accusation for years. Armstrong was accused last October of running 'the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen'. Tygart said the cyclist's refusal to help in the probe was 'one of the lowest days of this investigation, quite honestly.' 'We were disappointed he didn't come in and be part of the solution,' he added. The New York Times reported last week . that Armstrong and Tygart had been meeting about a possible confession. Armstrong's attorney, Tim Herman, denied the meetings had taken place. He is due to give a no-holds-barred . interview with Oprah Winfrey next week. A special 90-minute episode of . 'Oprah's Next Chapter' will air on January 17 on Winfrey's OWN network . and it is widely expected Armstrong, 41, will give an emotional account . of the alleged doping scandal and use of performance enhancing drugs . that has ruined his once glittering career. It will be streamed live around the world on Oprah.com next Thursday as well as broadcast in the US at 2am UK time. 1992: Turned professional with Motorola Cycling Team and won his first race a year later . 1996: Diagnosed with testicular cancer aged 25.

January 17, 2013: Armstrong to appear on Oprah amid speculation that he will confess all . Bookmakers have been taking bets on which words Armstrong will use in the interview, with Ladbrookes offering 1/4 for 'sorry', evens for 'confess' and 'innocent' and 1/4 for 'apologise'. They were offering 8/11 that he will burst into tears. If Armstrong were to confess, there could be legal consequences, involving past and present civil cases and possibly perjury. Claim: CEO of the US Anti-Doping Agency Travis Tygart said earlier this week that Armstrong offered the agency a $150,000 donation in 2004. The star's attorney denied the claim . Allegations: Travis Tygart said Armstrong had offered the drugs authority a donation of at least $150,000 during an interview with CBS 60 Minutes Sport . Anticipation: Lance Armstrong is due to appear on Oprah next week, he has spoken to the popular chat show host several times including in 2005 . He has testified under oath . that he never used performance-enhancing drugs, which could . theoretically lead to charges if he confessed. Former U.S. track star . Marion Jones spent several months in federal prison for lying to . investigators about her drug use. Tainted success: Armstrong has been stripped of his seven Tour de France titles after the report by the US Anti-Doping Agency . In addition to having his seven Tour de France titles stripped, Armstrong was banned for life from competing, which makes him ineligible for triathlons and other events sanctioned by USADA or the World Anti-Doping Agency. In the interview, Tygart said a representative of Armstrong's approached USADA in 2004 with an offer of a donation of more than $150,000. Asked if it felt like he was being . bought off, Tygart responded: 'It was a clear conflict of interest for . USADA and we had no hesitation in rejecting that offer.' 'It was a clear conflict of interest for USADA,' Tygart said. 'We had no hesitation in rejecting that offer.' Herman denied such an offer was made. 'No . truth to that story,' Herman wrote Tuesday in an email to the AP. 'First Lance heard of it was today. He never made any such contribution . or suggestion.' Tygart also said he had been subject to numerous death threats from anonymous emails and letters. 'The worst was probably putting a bullet in my head,' Tygart said when asked to recall specific details of the letter. He said the threatening letters were turned over to the FBI. Tygart also discussed the pressure he . felt while pursuing the investigation, even after federal officials . decided to shut down their probe. Last . year, two members of Congress called for stronger oversight of USADA, . which receives more than half its $15 million annual budget from the . government.

'We're always concerned about the grant we get from the federal government,' Tygart said. 'If we're unwilling to take this case and help this sport move forward, that we're here for naught. We should shut down. And if they want to shut us down for doing our job on behalf of clean athletes, and the integrity of competition, then shut us down.'

A self-confessed white supremacist from Chicago plans to plead guilty to burning down his black neighbor's home in a racist attack, according to reports. Brian James Moudry, 35, has until now pleaded not guilty to setting fire to the family home in Joliet in 2007. But he has now requested to change his plea to guilty, according to the report by CBS. Plea change: Brian Moudry, pictured, will admit torching his neighbor's home in a racist attack, according to reports. The white supremacist is accused of setting the blaze to drive a black family out of his neighborhood . Court records allegedly show Moudry will admit the charges in federal court. It is alleged he was trying to force the family of ten out of the South Reed Street area. The couple, who were renting the home, had eight young children. All eight were in the property on June 17, 2007 at the time of the blaze, but managed to escape unharmed. Tattooed Moudry has previously served time for hate crimes, according to the report, and was allegedly a member of the far-right hate group headed by Matt Hale. Hale is serving a 40-year prison sentence for asking a follower to murder U.S. District Judge Joan Lefkow in 2002. The indictment against Moudry alleges he set the fire to 'injure, intimidate, and interfere with' the family. Neighbors: Brian Moudry is accused of setting a fire in the South Reed Street area of Joliet, Chicago, in 2007. He is accused of trying to force his black neighbors away from the area, pictured .

An aspiring model who made illegal copies of credit cards in order to buy more than £5,000 worth of designer clothes and shoes walked free from court today. Sabean Fulcher, 23, spent her fraudulent gains at luxury shoe shops in Knightsbridge such as Jimmy Choo, Ferragam and Christian Louboutin. She also went to Mayfair shops like Mulberry, Mui Mui and Tod's with three cloned American Express cards, and attempted to spend nearly £9,000 of other people's money. Fulcher, who describes herself as a 'model, actor and designer' and once appeared in a Katy B music video, was given a suspended sentence after pleading guilty to fraud. Her lawyer blamed her crimes on a relationship with an older man, telling Southwark Crown Court that Fulcher, from Ealing, had 'simply lost all common sense and integrity'. Judge Peter Testar said the defendant was merely the public face of a criminal gang, and accepted the argument that she was led astray by her older lover. 'What has happened here is that a gang or group has somehow got involved in obtaining the details of genuine credit card holders and have cloned cards with the details of those genuine credit card holders,' he said. '[They have] cloned them with your name and you've then been sent out by the group as the one who, no doubt appearing respectable as you did, was to go in to the shops and obtain high value goods. 'The mitigation, which I accept, is that you were involved with some man, no doubt much more criminal than you, and you were required by him to commit these offences.' Prosecutor James Robottom said . Fulcher was first arrested after she attempted to buy two pairs of Jimmy . Choo shoes for £1,300 on February 29, 2012. She tried to use a blue American Express card to pay, and handed over her provisional driving licence as proof of her identity. 'The . card transaction was declined,' said the lawyer. 'The credit card was . cut up by the sales assistant. The police were called subsequent to . that. 'The blue American Express card . attempted to be used corresponded to a genuine U.S. account for a . Platinum Delta card held by a lady with a billing address in New York. The blue one attempted to be used was counterfeit.' He said the same card had been used to pay for £1,049 worth of shoes in Ferragamo and £799 worth in Christian Loubotin. The aspiring model bought more than £5,000 worth of designer clothes with three cloned credit cards . Before Fulcher was interviewed by police, she used a second card at Tod's, Mulberry and Miu Miu, according to Mr Robottom. He said she bought three pairs of driving gloves and a men's leather bag at Tod's, and a £950 black bag from Mulberry. When was arrested in Miu Miu after . trying to buy two bags worth £1,025 with a Platinum American Express . card police discovered a second cloned card in her bag. Both cards were . registered to genuine accounts in Michigan. Fulcher pleaded guilty to four counts of fraud and was sentenced to 10 months in jail suspended for two years . Mr . Robottom said: 'On the three cards on those days the total attempts . were worth £8,766 and the total loss to American Express was £5,321.' Defence counsel Victoria Meads said: 'The circumstances of the offences boil down to a relationship she found herself in. 'She became involved with a man we know as ""Nathan"". During the course of the relationship, I can only put it like this - she simply lost all common sense and integrity, she became completely involved with him.

Hospital patients in Wales are to be served healthy food that meets mandatory nutritional standards next year - but England will not follow suit, campaigners said today. NHS patients in Wales will receive meals that limits the amount of saturated fat and salt but provides plenty of protein, fruit and vegetables. Food for thought: Nutritious meals are essential to patient recovery . Patients must receive seven to eight drinks per day, water jugs must be changed three times a day and snacks must be available 24 hours a day. All hospitals have been told they must implement the standards, which are being phased in from January, and must be completely in place by 2013. However, no such criteria has been set for hospitals in England. It follows the news that more than one in 10 patients rate hospital food as poor, according to a survey of more than 60,000 NHS patients. The Good Food for Our Money campaign is now calling on Health Secretary Andrew Lansley to follow Wales' lead and implement a system in England. The campaign is a coalition of groups including the National Heart Forum, Patient Concern and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. A poll of 1,000 people for the group found 84 per cent thought hospitals in England should have to meet minimum standards too. Some 72 per cent were unaware English hospitals do not have to meet minimum standards. Support: The Prince of Wales, Patron of the Soil Association hosted a reception this month for hospitals who are serving local, organic food to their patients on a budget. Pictured with TV chef James Martin . Alex Jackson, co-ordinator of the Good Food for Our Money campaign, said: 'Introducing legally binding standards for hospital food in England is the simplest and most effective way to improve patients' meals. 'It's unacceptable that hospital patients in Wales will be guaranteed healthy meals but patients in England will not. 'Andrew Lansley must listen to the people and introduce these standards as a matter of urgency.' Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said: 'Patients in hospital need every support to get better and back to their families as soon as possible. 'A healthy and nutritional meal is one of the key steps on the road to recovery. 'Patients must be given nutritionally balanced and healthy meals as standard when in hospital. 'Wales is leading the way when it comes to free prescription charges and it is excellent they are guaranteeing healthy meals in their hospitals. 'Andrew Lansley needs to sit up and take notice and make these initiatives apply in England.' The Prince of Wales, who is Patron of the Soil Association, showed his support for nutritious hospital meals this month by hosting a reception for hospitals who are serving local, organic food on a budget. A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said: 'Hospitals must provide good food and the help needed to eat it - it's an essential part of hospital care. 'We have set binding standards - good hydration and nutrition is a condition of a hospital's registration with the regulator, the Care Quality Commission. 'We have also introduced Government Buying Standards, which hospitals must consider when planning food services. 'The amount of money hospitals are spending on food has gone up over the past five years, and waste is going down. 'Many trusts have excellent food and are serving healthy, fresh meals to their patients whilst staying within budget. 'These trusts set a precedent for others to follow and the whole NHS should be learning from the best trusts.' Earlier this year chef Lloyd Grossman accused NHS bosses of  thwarting his attempts to reform hospital meals. The food specialist headed a £40million revamp of NHS menus amid great fanfare in 2000, pledging to replace soggy sprouts and lumpy custard with healthy and tasty dishes. But the initiative was scrapped just five years later, after Mr Grossman left in frustration at the lack of progress. Grossman, who was not paid for his involvement in the initiative, told Channel 4: ‘It seemed so obvious and it still seems so obvious that if you give patients better food they will be happier, they will heal more quickly. ‘There was kind of a prejudice against common sense.'","Welsh patients will receive at least seven drinks a day and have snacks available 24 hours a day .

Lance Armstrong has been stripped of his 2000 Olympic Games cycling time trial bronze medal by the International Olympic Committee, continuing his spectacular fall from grace. 'We have written asking for the return of the medal from the Sydney 2000 Games,' an IOC official told Reuters on Thursday after the decision to take away the last major title won by the disgraced American. The move was confirmed to the AP on the same day that Armstrong's admission of using performance-enhancing drugs – after years of denials – is to be broadcast in an interview with Oprah Winfrey. Stripped: Lance Armstrong of the USA celebrates bronze in the Mens Road Cycling Individual Time Trial at Moore Park on day 15 of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia. The IOC has now struck his position from the records . Retired Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles and banned for life by the International Cycling Union (UCI) in October after several riders testified that he took drugs. The testimony came in a United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) report in which the 41-year-old's former U.S. Postal team was accused of running 'the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen'. Armstrong, a cancer survivor who founded the Livestrong Foundation, has always denied wrongdoing but is due to appear on U.S. television later on Thursday with reports saying he will confess to taking banned substances. The 2000 bronze was the only Olympic medal Armstrong ever claimed despite dominating cycling by winning the Tour from 1999 to 2005.

Lance Armstrong faces a series of interviews over his sordid past if he is to one day return to sporting competition.The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and International Cycling Union (UCI) have told Armstrong, whose interview by Oprah Winfrey is to be broadcast later this week, to share his information with the authorities.The motives for an admission - revealed by Winfrey - are unclear, but the 41-year-old Texan, who retired from cycling for a second time in 2010, was competing in triathlons until he was banned last year.Reacting to Winfrey's comments ahead of Thursday's broadcast of the first part of the interview, WADA director general David Howman said in a statement: 'Only when Mr Armstrong makes a full confession under oath - and tells the anti-doping authorities all he knows about doping activities - can any legal and proper process for him to seek any reopening or reconsideration of his lifetime ban commence.'The UCI, cycling's world governing body, also urged Armstrong to co-operate with official channels and join the independent review it set up in the aftermath of the USADA report. The IOC executive board discussed revoking the medal last month, but delayed a decision until cycling body UCI formally notified Armstrong he had been stripped of his seven Tour de France titles and all results since 1998. He then had 21 days to appeal. Now that the deadline has expired, the IOC decided to take the medal away. The letter to Armstrong also was sent to the U.S. Olympic Committee. 'Following the recent decisions of USADA and the UCI regarding the competitive cycling results of Lance Armstrong, the IOC has disqualified Armstrong from the events in which he competed at the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games,' the IOC said in a statement. 'Namely, the men's individual road race, where he finished 13th, and the men's individual time trial, where he finished 3rd and was awarded with a bronze medal and a certificate.' The IOC has asked Armstrong to return the medal and certificate to the United States Olympic Committee which should send them on to the Olympic ruling body. 'The decision was taken in principle at the IOC Executive Board meeting in December, but its implementation required the expiration of the appeal deadline,' the IOC said. Spaniard Abraham Olano Manzano came . fourth in the Sydney time trial and the IOC official said it had yet to . be decided if he would be moved up to bronze. IOC . sources said, however, it was very unlikely Manzano would be promoted . because the organization preferred to leave the medal vacant as it has . done with the medals of American athlete Marion Jones, also a doping . offender, from the same Games. Oprah Winfrey's OWN Network have begun a countdown clock ahead of the sensational interview with Lance Armstrong that airs tonight and Friday . Contrite? Armstrong has been stripped of his Olympic medal . An IOC spokesman said: 'We have written to Armstrong asking for him to return the medal and informed the US Olympic Committee. 'It was a decision taken in principle at the executive board before Christmas. We were waiting for confirmation from the UCI that he hadn't appealed against his disqualification.' The shamed icon was written to by the IOC after telling Oprah Winfrey that, despite years of denials, his seven Tour de France titles were fueled by illegal stimulants - an admission that prompted the world's leading crusader against drugs in sport to question cycling's place in the Olympic Games. Dick Pound, an IOC member and the former head of the World Anti- Doping Agency, said if the governing UCI are complicit in Armstrong's doping offences, 'the only way they are going to clean up is if all these people say, ""Hey, we're no longer in the Olympics and that's where we want to be so let's earn our way back into it"". 'The IOC would have to deal with it. The UCI are not known for their strong actions in anti-doping. It was the same in weightlifting a few years ago. 'All of a sudden when you get right up against it things go fuzzy and they say, ""Well, we can't punish innocent athletes in these sports by dropping the sport from the program"".' Coming clean: Oprah Winfrey said both she and Armstrong were exhausted after the interview . The bleak news mounted up for Armstrong last night with Pound's former organisation, WADA, insisting that the Oprah Winfrey mea culpa will not result in his lifetime ban from sport being overturned. They told Armstrong that giving evidence 'under oath' - rather than to America's talk show queen - was the only conceivable way he could compete again in his favourite post-cycling pursuit, triathlon. Those sobering words arrived after Winfrey appeared on the CBS This Morning programme to talk up her exclusive interview. She confirmed that the 41-year-old Texan finally admitted to cheating. But hinting at an unexpected turn of events, Winfrey teased: 'He did not come clean in the manner I expected.' Drama: Lance Armstrong admitted doping to Oprah Winfrey . Asked if Armstrong was contrite, . Winfrey said: 'I choose not to characterise. I would rather people make . their own decisions. I thought he was serious.

As one of the world’s most provocative pop stars, Madonna’s often on the receiving end of strong comment. But even she may be wincing today after one of Vladimir Putin’s right-hand men described her as a ‘moralising slut’. Paying the price for interfering with Russian politics, the star was told: ‘Either take off your cross, or put on your knickers.’ The attack on Twitter by deputy prime minister Dmitry Rogozin came as Madonna vowed to back gay campaigners during her concert last night in St Petersburg where there is a legal ban on promoting homosexuality to young people. Earlier the 53-year-old had offended the Kremlin by demanding the release of the Russian punk band Pussy Riot  who face probable jail for an anti-Putin protest in a Moscow cathedral. Rogozin said on the messaging site: ‘With age, every former s. tries to lecture everyone on morality.’ While he didn’t use the entire word, the meaning was clear to all as the Russian word for ‘slut’ or ‘whore’. At her Moscow concert earlier in the week, Madonna scrawled the words ‘Pussy Riot’ on her back and sang ‘Like a Virgin’ wearing the punk group’s balaclava. There were calls for Madonna to face prosecution if she goes ahead with any kind of stunt in St Petersburg that could be construed as ‘homosexual propaganda’. Pink wristbands were to be distributed at the concert. ‘If this is the case, steps will be taken to open an administrative probe, and she will face a fine for violating this law,’ said one source in the St Petersburg legislature. Local law-makers this year enacted fines for those 'promoting homosexuality' to minors, equating it with paedophilia. Gay Pride marches are effectively illegal in the city. Russia legalised homosexuality in 1993 after the fall of the Soviet Union but only ceased to classify it as a mental disorder in 1999, and homophobic attitudes still run high in the country.

A mother died when her car was hit by a train on a level crossing because a signalman mistakenly raised the barriers after becoming distracted by a phone call, a court heard. The car that hairdresser Jane Harding, 52, was in was struck by a passenger train at 61mph and dragged 150 yards down the track. A jury was told that moments before the crash, signalman Adrian Maund ‘panicked’ when a local farmer called for a second time seeking clearance to guide his sheep over another crossing further up the track. Tragedy: Jane Harding was hit while crossing the track by car after Adrian Maund lifted the barriers too early . While he was distracted, Maund lifted . the barriers, believing the Manchester to Milford Haven train had . already passed the crossing, the court heard. Maund, 43, only realised his fatal . mistake when he saw it approaching at 80mph around a corner –  and . frantically tried to lower the barriers and change the signal at the . Moreton-on-Lugg, Herefordshire, crossing. Mrs Harding’s husband, Mark, who was driving their Volkswagen Touareg, survived the incident with shoulder and pelvic injuries. Birmingham Crown Court heard that . although human error was a factor in the crash, the tragedy could have . been prevented if Network Rail had not declined to spend £40,000 on a . simple safety device which could stop signals being changed when a train . was approaching. He was distracted by a call from a farmer asking if he could herd sheep across the tracks at Moreton-on-Lugg . The company, which owns and operates . rail infrastructure, allegedly refused to install the approach-locking . system during improvement works a year earlier because of cost concerns. This decision made the firm equally . culpable, according to Philip Mott QC, prosecuting. Mr Mott added: . ‘Network Rail took the decision not to install this device because it . would cost £40,000 – that device could have saved a life. ‘An approach-locking system has been . around since the 1960s and can be used to stop signals being changed . when trains are still coming through. In 2009 there was quite a lot of . work done at the Moreton crossing and the barriers were replaced. There . were discussions to have an approach-locking device which were rejected. Why not put in this device? The reason was money. Was the cost too . great to avoid the cost of a human life?’ In a police interview in January 2010, . Maund said he lifted the barriers because he thought the train had . already passed as cars were waiting at the crossing. But train driver . Andrew Robins had too little time to slow down and struck the Hardings’ VW and a second vehicle, a Vauxhall Astra.

Louise Mensch triggered today's Corby by-election when she quit as the MP to move her family to the US . Senior Tories predicted a ‘bloodbath’ in the Corby by-election today, blaming outgoing MP Louise Mensch for impending electoral disaster. Party chiefs said they were on course to lose the Northamptonshire seat to Labour because Mrs Mensch decided to abandon her seat to move to New York. The seat was won by the Tories in 2010 for the first time since 1992. Insiders said a ‘massive Mensch factor’ is preventing them defending the 2,000 majority she won at the 2010 general election. One senior figure told the Mail: ‘It’s going to be a bloodbath. We are going to get absolutely hammered.’ The source said Mrs Mensch’s name was ‘toxic’ on the doorstep. The former Tory A-List candidate was hailed as one of the faces of the new look party before the last election. But locals were unimpressed when she announced that she is moving her family to the US halfway through the Parliament to be closer to her husband Peter, the manager of rock band Metallica. Labour officials sought to downplay the prospects of an easy win, pointing out that windy weather could keep their voters from the polls. 'We think we have won the campaign but we are nervous about the outcome,' a source said. 'We will wait and see but whoever wins, no-one should expect it to be a big numerical majority.' David Cameron is urging the public to vote today in ‘historic’ elections for Police and Crime Commissioners amid fears of a record low turnout. The Prime Minister said the first elections for commissioners in 41 force areas in England and Wales were a chance for voters to ‘have a say about policing and crime in their areas’. Some have predicted turnout could be as low as 15 per cent, but a poll by ComRes found nearly half of those questioned were aware of the elections and intend to vote. Mr Cameron, who has been criticised for not doing enough to raise awareness of today’s elections, said: ‘At the moment there is only one elected police commissioner in the country – Boris Johnson in London. ‘But today, for the first time ever, everyone in the country can vote for one local law and order champion who sets the priorities for their police force.' Early postal vote returns suggest the overall turnout will be around 20 per cent, low even by modern standards in a by-election. Senior Tories are nervous that if . their voters fail to turn out, they could slip into third place behind . the UK Independence Party. The Liberal Democrats face the humiliation of . losing their deposit. UKIP . sources said they are ‘confident’ of securing at least third place but . doubtful that they can catch the Tories for second place. In all three by-elections are being held today. Manchester Central, with a Labour majority of more than 10,000 from 2010, was vacated by Tony Lloyd so that he could stand in today's Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) elections. Cardiff Central, where Labour won by just over 4,700 two-and-a-half years ago, was prompted by the resignation of another PCC candidate, Alun Michael, who has held the seat for 25 years. Labour also a shoo-in to retain both seats. In what promises to be a bad day for the Conservatives they predicted that the party would also lose key contests in the Tory heartlands in the police commissioner elections - also being held on Super Thursday - with Labour poised to triumph in Bedfordshire. Labour predicted that they will gain 8 and 10 of the PCC elections, seizing control of policing in major metropolitan areas like Manchester, the west Midlands, Northumbria and West Yorkshire. But that is lower than the 12 predicted by independent experts.","Voters go to the polls to elect three new MPs and 41 police and crime commissioners, but fears about record low turnouts .

Bioengineers have used 3D printing to achieve a breakthrough in prosthesis by creating the first artificial ears that look and act like real ones. A new study by researchers at Cornell University, New York, shows how prosthetic ears almost indistinguishable from natural ones can be 3D printed using gels made of living cells. Not only that, but over a three-month period these flexible, artificial ears grew even their own cartilage to replace the collagen used to mould them. New hope: Professor Lawrence Bonassar and colleagues collaborated with Weill Cornell Medical College physicians to create an artificial ear using 3D printing and injectable molds . 'This is such a win-win for both medicine and basic science, demonstrating what we can achieve when we work together,' said study author Lawrence Bonassar, associate professor of biomedical engineering. The novel ear may be the solution surgeons have long wished for to help children born with ear deformity, said co-author Dr Jason Spector, professor of plastic surgery at Weill Cornell Medical College. 'A bioengineered ear replacement like this would also help individuals who have lost part or all of their external ear in an accident or from cancer,' he said. Currently, replacement ears are usually constructed with materials that have an unnatural Styrofoam-like consistency . Alternatively surgeons may sometimes build ears from a patient's harvested rib, but this option is challenging and painful for children, and the ears rarely look natural or perform well, said Dr Spector. Breakthrough: A 3D printer in Weill Hall deposits cells encapsulated in a hydrogel that will develop into new ear tissue. The printer takes instructions from a file built from 3D scans of real human ears . To make the ears, Professor Bonassar and colleagues started with a digitised 3D image of a human subject's ear. They then used a 3D printer to assemble a mould based on the scan and poured in their 'living' collagen gel. A bionic hand which allows the recipient to feel ‘lifelike’ sensations is to be transplanted on to a patient’s arm for the first time. Until now, artificial limbs have been able to pick up brain signals destined for the absent hand and translate them into movements, but they could not give sensory feedback. The new hand, which is attached directly to the nervous system via electrodes clipped on to two of the arm’s main nerves, aims to restore a sense of touch in amputees. The electrodes will allow the recipient to control the hand using just their thoughts – and will also send signals back to the brain. Scientists hope the breakthrough will pave the way  for a new generation of artificial limbs that more closely imitate real body parts by providing feeling and increased dexterity. This Cornell-developed, high-density gel is similar to the consistency of jelly when the mould is removed. The collagen serves as a scaffold upon which cartilage could grow. The process is also fast, Professor Bonassar added. 'It takes half a day to design the mould, a day or so to print it, 30 minutes to inject the gel, and we can remove the ear 15 minutes later,' he said. 'We trim the ear and then let it culture for several days in nourishing cell culture media before it is implanted.' The new process offers hope to thousands of children born with a congenital deformity called microtia. The incidence of microtia, which is when the external ear is not fully developed, varies from almost 1 to more than 4 per 10,000 births each year. Many children born with microtia have an intact inner ear, but experience hearing loss due to the missing external structure. Dr Spector and Professor Bonassar have been collaborating on bioengineered human replacement parts since 2007. Professor Bonassar has also worked with Weill Cornell neurological surgeon Dr Roger Härtl on bioengineered disc replacements using some of the same techniques. The researchers specifically work on replacement human structures that are primarily made of cartilage – joints, trachea, spine, nose – because cartilage does not need to be vascularized with a blood supply in order to survive. 'Using human cells, specifically those from the same patient, would reduce any possibility of rejection,' Dr Spector said. He added that the best time to implant a bioengineered ear on a child would be when they are about five or six years old. At that age, ears are 80 per cent of their adult size. If all safety and efficacy trials prove successful, it might be possible to try the first human implant of a Cornell bioengineered ear in as little as three years, Dr Spector said.","The prosthetics are 3D printed using gels made of living cells .
After they are implanted they even begin to grow their own cartilage .

Relations between Norway and Sweden are being strained with the publication of a new book, which details how Stockholm aided the Nazis during WW2 as their neighbours fought and lost a decisive battle against the German invaders. Sweden stayed neutral in the war but Norway was among the first conquests of Hitler. Now a new book shows how Sweden let the Germans use its efficient rail network to transport men and materials to the battle of Narvik, where British troops were deployed in a bid to stave off the Nazi hordes. Occupation by rail: SS officers Reinhard Heydrich (front centre), Heinrich Fehlis (front right, next to Heydrich) and Rolf Schiedermair (behind Heydrich) in Oslo in 1941 . Narvik-based journalist Espen Eidum spent three years sifting through Norwegian, Swedish and German archives to discover how the Nazis had managed to get troops and supplies to the front lines in Narvik in 1940, enabling them to turn a losing battle into a decisive victory that led to the conquest and brutal occupation of the whole country. Sweden, although neutral, had in fact gone out of its way to aid the Germans, who would rely on the country for much of its iron ore during the war. After the publication of his book Blodsporet - The Blood Track - Mr Eidum said: 'The Germans used the Swedish rail network on a large scale during the fighting. The operation was much more extensive than historians have previously realised.' New revalation: German troops disarm Norwegians at the beginning of the occupation. A new book claims neutral Sweden allowed the Nazis to use their railways to prensport troops and equipment to and from Norway . The book details how, in October 1940 - four months after Narvik had turned into a crushing defeat for both the Norwegians and Winston Churchill, who had sent British forces there - Swedish diplomats in London lied to Norwegian government-in-exile representatives that it had not allowed any Nazi soldiers or weaponry to use its railway network to get to the front. Mr Eidum said: 'The German foreign ministry had earlier summoned the Swedish ambassador in Berlin to inform him that Adolf Hitler had personally requested for the Nazis to be permitted to send three trains with 30 to 40 sealed carriages through Sweden to the far north of Norway. 'Hitler’s representatives told the Swedes that the Germans had a number of wounded soldiers at the front and urgently needed to send in medical officers and food. 'The Germans also made no secret of the fact that winning the battle in Narvik was a matter of some pride for Hitler.' Blood track: Sweden's SJ railway network is accused of collaborating with the Nazis during the war. Mr Eidum said: 'This made a great deal of money for Swedish rail operator SJ over a three year period' Once the permission was given Germany sent in combat troops disguised as medical personnel. Mr Eidum said: 'For every actual medical officer or orderly, the trains carried 17 infantrymen. 'A report sent by a Swedish representative in Berlin, who watched the officers board the train, left little doubt that the Swedes knew the trains were being used for troop movements.' In addition, according to the book, the trains carried heavy artillery, anti-aircraft guns, ammo and a plethora of communications and supply equipment. And, once the swastika flew over Narvik, Sweden allowed German trains to run to the port - taking Swedish iron ore back to Germany, where it was used to fuel the war machine. Mr Eidum said: 'Sweden's railway network was used extensively to aid the German occupation of Norway. This included sending Norwegians to Germany, many of them bound for concentration camps. 'And hundreds of thousands of Germans passed through Sweden on their way to the eastern front. This made a great deal of money for Swedish rail operator SJ over a three year period.' A letter from Norway’s wartime prime minister, Johan Nygaardsvold - sent on New Year’s Eve 1940 to his Stockholm-based party colleague Anders Frihagen and reproduced in the book - shows Mr Nygaardsvold asking his government’s Stockholm envoy to convey his anger to the Swedish prime minister Per Albin Hansson. He writes: 'If you can arrange a private conversation with Per Albin Hansson you can give him my greetings and tell him there are two things I want to experience, and those are: that the Germans get hunted out of Norway and, secondly, that I get to live long enough to give him and his entire government a proper dressing down – maybe even his entire party. 'There is nothing, nothing, nothing I hate with such passion and wild abandon as Sweden - and it is his fault.' In all, close to 100,000 railroad cars transported 1,004,158 military personnel on leave to Germany and 1,037,158 to Norway through Sweden by the time the transit agreement between the two nations was disbanded on August 15, 1943. Norway lost around 10,000 people in the war, two thirds of them civilians.","Use of Swedish SJ rail system helped Germany win battle of Narvik .

A school girl who was in so much pain she became hooked on 12 painkillers-a-day has made an amazing recovery. Louiselle Morris, from Cardiff, was just 13 when she went for a routine visit to her doctor for what she thought was a common cold. But instead she was diagnosed with crippling scoliosis - an extreme curving of the spine  - and was given a morphine-like drug for the pain. Louiselle Morris from Cardiff (pictured now 20), who became addicted to painkillers to cope with a debilitating condition has made a remarkable recovery . By the time she was 14 she was relying on twelve painkillers a day. Thanks to an intense course of physiotherapy, Miss Morris, now 20, has learnt to deal with the aches without medication. She said: 'I was already a hormonal 14-year-old.I just did not want to go outside. I was a self conscious teenager. I wondered what people were saying about my back and I thought I was ugly. 'My school attendance was erratic and I couldn't walk more than 500 metres. Since the physiotherapy I can go to university and to work without being in too much pain. 'I can now manage a day without feeling like I've been hit by a sledgehammer.' An x-ray of Louiselle Morris showing the extreme curving of the spine. She was diagnosed with crippling scoliosis . She was told that if the scoliosis was left untreated it could lead to fatal heart and lung problems. Her spine was a 48 degree curve and there was a risk that her rib cage could shift and move her internal organs. The only treatment for the chronic condition was a high risk operation where two metal rods would be stuck into her spine and then fused solid. But her condition was borderline and doctors refused to operate because she was in too much pain. Within months she was suffering from chronic pain and could not walk more than fifty metres or go to school without collapsing. Her mother Susan Morris said: 'Three months after she was diagnosed, Louiselle had changed. She had gone from being a typical, active teenage girl to living life as an 80-year-old woman, confined to the four walls of her bedroom.' She would try walking around, lying on her back and on her front, but nothing helped. Doctors prescribed Louiselle tramadol, a strong painkiller, to cope. The drug is similar to morphine and is only used as a short term answer to chronic pain. She was so reliant on painkillers that she was taking four tramadol and eight paracetamol every day. Mrs Morris, 49, said: 'She was in a terrible state, it was horrendous. 'She lost so much confidence and I was desperate. I tried everything to get her off the medication. 'To see her in so much pain was so scary. I would have driven to the end of the world to try and help her.' Her daughter added: 'I was sleeping and I just didn't see a way out of it. I couldn't see how the situation was going to resolve itself. 'I was just trying to cope with the here and now and that was the only way I could at that time.' Her mother said she had reached breaking point when she found a clinic that could help. She said: 'I remember speaking to Scoliosis SOS who understood everything I was saying. They knew how I felt as a parent and how traumatic it could be for the child involved.' They drove six hours to the clinic with Louiselle doubled over in pain on the back seat of the car. She had a consultation and was put on an intensive exercise therapy course four days later, which consisted of six hours of exercises each day for four weeks. She was taught what the condition means, the effects it has on the body and was prescribed an individual physiotherapy treatment. She said: 'I was going through withdrawal because I had been taking so many tablets. It was one of the worst pains you can imagine. 'My whole body felt like it was turning in on me, it was absolutely horrendous. 'I was throwing up violently for about a week and had nausea and muscular cramps.' But by the end of the second week of therapy, she was off the painkillers. Mrs Morris said: 'Tramadol is so highly addictive and the person taking it has to want to stop, or else you haven't got a hope in hell. She became so reliant on painkillers that she was taking four tramadol and eight paracetamol every day (stock image) Louiselle with her mother Susan. Her mother said she had reached breaking point when she found a clinic that could help . 'Scoliosis SOS' whole body approach to treating scoliosis and dealing with associated pain was that light at the end of the tunnel. It was a means to so many ends. 'We got her down to one tramadol a day. Stopping her take the last one was such a battle but she realised how important it was to stop. She said to me, 'right it's going to go in the bin'.' She spent up to six hours a day at the clinic stretching and strengthening her muscles with intensive exercises. She said: 'The exercise therapy changed my life. I have no idea where I would have been if my mum had not found the centre when she did. 'I could not do anything and my whole life was just slipping away from me.' Her pain had been caused by an imbalance of the muscles and after her muscles had been strengthened and stretched, she said it had almost disappeared. She said: 'The clinic has given me the confidence to believe in myself. I feel like I am in control again and scoliosis no longer rules my life.' Miss Morris returns to the London clinic every couple of months for a two-hour session to review her progress and keep her on track. Instead of numbing the pain the drugs, Louiselle will now exercise or take a hot bath to ease her aching back. She said her pain has gone from excruciating to an occasional ache. She is studying psychology at Cardiff Metropolitan University and wants to help other young girls. She said: 'I have loved every second of university and I really do put my happiness down to these exercises. 'My mum has stood by me and fought so hard to help me. She has been fantastic. I don't feel like a hunchback anymore. I am normal and I can finally look forward to my future.'","Louiselle Morris, from Cardiff, was in so much pain she moved like an '80 year old woman'

Aeroplane passengers who sat near the first person in the UK to be diagnosed with a new Sars-like virus have been are being tracked down and tested for the illness. The infected man, who travelled back to London at the end of January from Saudi Arabia, later passed the virus on to his son, who died last Sunday in a Birmingham hospital. The Health Protection  Agency (HPA) has confirmed that passengers who sat in the same row or two rows in front or behind the man on the flight back from Saudi Arabia are being traced. Infectious: The coronavirus (pictured) has claimed six lives worldwide, including one in Britain . A spokesperson told MailOnline this was a standard procedure for any type of infectious disease, such as measles or tuberculosis. The HPA said it had followed up more than 100 people who had close contact with cases in this family cluster. 'Besides the identified secondary cases, all tests carried out on . contacts to date have been negative for the novel coronavirus . infection,' it said. Family and friends of the affected man are also being traced. A second relative of the first affected man has also been diagnosed with a mild form of the illness but has since recovered. So far there have only been four confirmed cases of the illness in Britain and 12 anywhere in the world, with six deaths - just one in the UK. The 39-year-old, who died in the intensive care unit at Birmingham’s . Queen Elizabeth Hospital, caught the illness from his father, who had . become infected while travelling in Pakistan and the Middle East. Healthcare workers who have treated those infected have also been tested and reassured that the risk to their health is 'extremely low' after the relative of a patient died from a Sars-like virus. The man on the flight later infected his 39-year-old son, who died at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital (pictured) on Sunday . The Queen Elizabeth Hospital said last week that the patient's admission had been subject to stringent infection controls. The illness, known as novel coronavirus, causes a cough, breathing difficulties and fever which can lead to pneumonia and kidney failure. It is from the same virus family as Sars, which claimed 900 lives worldwide in 2002 and 2003. But scientists say novel coronavirus is nowhere near as dangerous as it has difficulty spreading between humans. The man who died on Sunday was suffering from a long-term condition which made him more susceptible. His father is still being treated at a hospital in Manchester. Scientists think the illness may be spread via bat droppings or through water droplets from coughs and sneezes. Professor John Watson, head of the respiratory diseases department at the HPA, said: ‘This case [the person who died] is a family member who was in close personal contact with the earlier case and who may have been at greater risk of acquiring an infection because of their underlying health condition. 'To date, evidence of person-to-person transmission has been limited. Although this case provides strong evidence for person to person transmission, the risk of infection in most circumstances is still considered to be very low.'","Those who sat in two rows in front or behind the man on the flight from Saudi Arabia are being traced .

Jon Snow, pictured with wife Precious Lunga, wrote of the unpleasant memories of his own abuse that had been brought up by the Savile scandal . Jon Snow told yesterday how the Jimmy Savile scandal has forced him to relive the abuse he suffered as a child. The Channel 4 News veteran described how when he was six years old he was ‘abducted’ by a member of the domestic staff at the school where his father taught. ‘He took me to his room and undressed me, and then himself. Thank heavens someone saw the abduction and eventually a member of staff intervened and rescued me,’ he said. ‘I remember to this day fretting over not being able to do my braces up. 'And I admit I have found Savile regurgitating the guilt and confusion I felt.’ Mr Snow first wrote about the abuse he suffered in his autobiography Shooting History, published in 2004. Yesterday he wrote on his blog on Channel 4’s website that the Savile saga was having a ‘vast effect’ on many abuse victims, with the ‘swirl of allegation and denial that is filling the airwaves’ leading many, like him, to relive what happened to them. In the blog article, titled ‘Our sexual watershed’, Mr Snow, 65, added: ‘When I started in television more than three decades ago, many of the few women in the newsroom were treated first and foremost as sex objects and only secondarily journalists. Remarks about physique and “sexiness” were rife. ‘There was improper touching too, a needless brushing in passing, a pinched bottom.’ He described how the bar was ‘in-house’ and inexpensive, many would start drinking at lunchtime and it was ‘commonplace for some newscasters to go to air the worse for wear’. Jon Snow said revelations about Savile exposed tolerance to gross misbehaviour if the celebrity was big enough . ‘And if that was happening in the news divisions, Savile tells us about what was happening in entertainment,’ he added. Oxford educated Mr Snow said the Savile affair had ‘exposed the institutional tolerance of the established media to gross misbehaviour, so long as the celebrity was big enough’. He praised the ‘courageous’ victims of Savile who have come forward to speak publicly about what he did to them, so inspiring others to come forward to expose their abusers. ‘This is a dramatic moment in the affairs of men and women; we shall all be tested,’ he said. ‘But don’t underestimate what this time means to the abused. I know.’ He said the contrast with today . is ‘acute’ and he knows ‘almost no one who drinks at lunchtime or indeed . any time before the working day is done’. ‘One . small comfort we can take is that many of us have truly been through a . genuine sexual revolution - both in attitudes and behaviourally.’ Oxford-educated Mr Snow became the main . presenter of Channel 4 News in 1989. For 35 years his partner was human . rights lawyer Madeleine Colvin, with whom he has two daughters. In 2010 . he married Precious Lunga, a Zimbabwe-born academic.","Jon Snow said in blog post that scandal brought back guilt of abuse age six .

A boy with a rare condition meaning he can't resist eating wall plaster has been given a unique birthday present - an inedible bedroom. Zach Tahir is celebrating his sixth birthday today, and his new bedroom has been unveiled after he gnawed through the walls of the last one. The youngster suffers from the rare condition Pica, which causes him to crave inedible objects, including stones, paper and moss. Scroll down for video . Happy birthday! Pica-sufferer Zach Tahir is celebrating being six today with a new bedroom he can't eat . Zach suffers from the rare condition Pica, which causes him to crave inedible objects, including stones, paper and moss . But his craving for the things around him went to a whole new level when he began to chew through through plasterboard and nibble through his blinds. Mother Rachel Horn, 32, said: 'There's no limit to what he will try and eat. 'We don't know what appeals to him about the objects around him but there's nothing we can do to stop him trying to chew through anything and everything.' Zach's new bedroom has been uniquely designed with squash-court walls that due to their tough shiny surface, means he won't be able to gnaw at them. And, the room has been kitted out with fool-proof furniture that he's unable to sink his teeth into, with slanted window sills to stop him climbing. Ms Horn said: 'His wardrobes and chest of drawers have been made with rounded edges and installed so he can't pull them over.

Zach's mother Rachel Horn, 32, said: 'There's no limit to what he will try and eat.' Zach's mother looking at a screen showing how she can monitor her child . 'We have also had to have the blinds in his bedroom installed in between the window panes so he can't reach them, and the sticks to adjust them are magnetic so I can remove them as and when.' The bedroom, thought to be the first of its kind for PICA sufferers, has cost the family £36,000 to be created as an extension had to be built on the family's home in Salford, Greater Manchester. Salford Council have stumped up £26,000 as part of a disability allowance, but Ms Horn has managed to raise a further £10,000 through charitable donations. Members of the Coronation Street cast got behind the campaign to raise money for Zach .

Ms Horn, . who gave up her job in a bank to look after Zach, said: 'It's been . overwhelming how much people have helped to raise the money for Zach's . room. 'It's such a . worry knowing he could put anything in his mouth, and when he began . eating wood, I was terrified it may splinter in his mouth or he would . swallow a large piece and choke.' People suffering from Pica frequently crave and eat substances with no nutrition, such as dirt, paint, ice, sand, glue and chalk. The condition, which gets its name from the Latin word for magpie – a bird known for its large and indiscriminate appetite – affects up to 30 per cent of children aged between one and six. Although the condition sounds bizarre, it is actually classed as serious eating disorder that can cause serious health problems such as lead poisoning and anaemia. However, in some cases, a lack of certain nutrients, such as iron or zinc deficiency may trigger the unusual cravings. Pica is most common in people with learning or developmental disabilities, such as autism, or those who've suffered a brain injury. It can also be a problem for some pregnant women or people with epilepsy. In many cases, the disorder lasts several months, then disappears on its own. Otherwise, treatment can involve replacing missing nutrients causing the cravings, giving medication to deal with a learning disability or giving rewards for eating normal food. Zach, who has a younger sister, Isabella, three, has suffered with Pica all through his life and began by eating moss when he first could walk around outside. 'He likes things that are very textured, such as moss and paper, as he can mull them around and chew on them for a while,' Ms Horn said. 'It's worrying for me as a parent, as you worry what kind of germs he might be eating.' Amazingly, despite having the condition all of his life, Zach, who is autistic and cannot speak, has never needed any medical treatment. But, Ms Horn finds it hard to trust Zach as he goes out of his way to find things to eat. She has CCTV equipment installed in his bedroom which she can access at any time from her smartphone. She said: 'When I hear him in the night, I just switch on the camera through my phone and can see what I'm doing. 'If I go straight in there, he can become distressed and not want me to leave him again, so it's best if I can see what he's doing without him knowing. 'He doesn't sleep much because he has a very active mind due to being autistic so he keeps me on my toes, especially at night. 'His new room will mean he can settle more and will hopefully go to sleep for longer periods when he realises there's no point in him staying up to try and find things to eat.'","Zach Tahir, from Salford, suffers from the rare condition Pica .

At the age of just 20, Hannah Cockroft is a multiple world record holder, double paralympic gold medallist and an MBE thanks to her talent for wheelchair racing. But while no-one can doubt her sporting prowess, Hannah, who has cerebral palsy, said she often meets people who assume she's stupid because she's in a wheelchair. 'Some people pat you on head or treat like dog and can be patronising,' she told the MailOnline. 'But just . because your legs don't work, it doesn't mean your brain doesn't work. Golden girl: Hannah won the T34 100m and 200m at the London 2012 Paralympics . 'I . can laugh that kind of thing off but for others it can be degrading and . upsetting, we just want to be seen as another member of society. Disabled people can be just as intellectual and clever as anyone else.' Hannah, . from Halifax, said there has been great strides in improving people's . perceptions of those with disabilities thanks to the London 2012 . Paralympics. She said: 'After Beijing Paralympians had attention for two weeks and then everyone forgot . about us for four years. But after London everything is still going on . six months down the line. It's like we're being given a chance now. Perceptions have changed. You still get one or two people that are like, . ""look at her she's a wheelchair, what can she do"" but most people are positive.' Changed her life: The charity Whizz-Kidz gave Hannah her first sports wheelchair when she was 15 . Hannah is supporting the children's . charity Whizz-Kidz's manifesto 'Generation Inspired?' that aims to build . on this positive platform and continue raising awareness of those with . disabilities. The manifesto contains the hopes and opinions of young . disabled people gathered in the months following the 2012 Paralympics, with their . recommendations for embedding the Games’ ethos and inclusivity into . everyday services. Hannah personally delivered the report to Downing Street today for the Government to consider. Whizz-Kidz gave Hannah her first . sports wheelchair at the age of 15 which she said completely . transformed her life - not only because it set her on a path to become a . world champion but because it gave her more day-to-day freedom. 'The NHS are brilliant at providing wheelchairs but it's not always a good . fit,' she explained. 'Whizz-Kidz provide chairs that fit perfectly giving people the . chance to get out and be independent. 'For me, getting a sports wheelchair gave me . independence so I could go out with my friends more and I could play sports like wheelchair basketball. 'It . opened a lot of doors so I could go out and not have to rely on someone . else pushing me and not find things like getting up kerbs so difficult.' Making a difference: Hannah and friends visited Downing Street today to deliver the charity's manifesto calling for a brighter future for disabled people . Sports wheelchairs have cambered wheels, sleeker tyres and are sturdier than the average day wheelchair - but also more expensive. There are an estimated 70,000 disabled children and young people in the UK waiting for a wheelchair that fits their young lives and it's these youngsters that Whizz-Kidz are trying to help. Hannah admits her life would have been completely different had she not received her wheelchair from the charity. 'Wheelchairs, particular sports ones, cost so much and that's the barrier stopping a lot of children being more independent or playing sport,' she said. Hannah played wheelchair basketball before taking up wheelchair racing. She's had a short but successful career so far winning the World Champs 100m and 200m titles in the T34 category in 2011 and then repeating this feat in front of a home crowd at the London Paralympics. She's now training to defend her world titles in Leon this year and looking forward to Rio 2016. Hannah is delighted that her achievements, and those of Paralympians such as David Weir, Richard Whitehead and Jonnie Peacock are now inspiring young people to get into sport, in the same way she was inspired by Tanni Grey-Thompson in her youth. But a Whizz-Kidz poll found that 'enthusiasm to get active is tempered by a lack of opportunity. More than two thirds of parents surveyed said their children’s schools don’t play any of the Paralympic sports.' Meeting Her Majesty: The athlete shows the Queen her gold medals on a visit to Buckingham Palace . The charity's report adds: 'While children may want to take up Boccia, wheelchair basketball, archery, wheelchair tennis and other Paralympic sports, opportunities to do so at school are limited. Our young people suggested mainstream schools and local clubs should work together to share facilities and equipment.' The charity manifesto adds that while it's fantastic children now have so many sporting role models, they also want disabled people to be more visible in other areas such as in media roles like TV presenting, in fashion, the arts and politics. Legacy: The manifesto aims to build on the success of the London 2012 Paralympics . While some progress has been made in wheelchair access on public transport, they would also like more to be done in this area. Hannah explains: 'We should be able to get on a train like . everyone but if you're in a wheelchair you have to phone ahead before your journey to make sure there are ramps. I've had loads of problems over the years on public transport. I start to feel like a . pain asking for ramps all the time and sometimes I get forgotten and miss my stop as I'm left on the carriage. 'Buses often only have . one space for wheelchairs so if I'm going out with a friend who is also in a wheelchair we have to get different buses.' Whizz-Kidz chief executive Ruth Owen said the charity hopes improvements can continue to be made in the coming years. 'The London Paralympics shone a spotlight on the talent, skill and ambition of disabled people. However it will be a hugely missed opportunity if we don’t capitalise on the legacy of the Games - and not just to create more access to sport, but to offer greater opportunity for young disabled people across all areas of society,' she said. 'The young wheelchair users we speak to tell us they face invisible and visible barriers every day. It’s essential to keep on challenging these and make an enduring difference.'","Gold medallist told MailOnline she's often patronised because she's in a wheelchair .

Tamara Ecclestone’s ex-fiance is facing jail today after he was found guilty of attempting to blackmail the socialite out of £200,000 by threatening to reveal her ‘intimate secrets’. Derek Rose, 33, emailed the wealthy star’s agent, Dana Malmstrom, warning her he would sell sordid stories about their sex life to the tabloid press if she did not pay. Rose dated 28-year-old Miss Ecclestone, the daughter of Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone, when she was 17, and was briefly engaged to her until he discovered she had cheated on him. He sobbed as he was convicted unanimously of blackmail by a jury at Southwark Crown Court after four hours of deliberation. Guilty: Derek Rose (left outside court today) went out with Miss Ecclestone (right) when she was 17 and tried to use sensitive information to blackmail her . Dressed in a smart grey suit, Rose cried and held his head in his hands after the jury delivered the verdict. In an email the heiress was asked to pay a £200,000 ‘non-release’ agreement within five days, which claimed falsely that a tabloid had given them a deadline to accept a lucrative deal. Victim: Miss Ecclestone arrives at Southwark Crown Court last week for the trial of the two men accused of blackmailing her . Miss Ecclestone’s agent Miss Malmstrom replied in November 2011 saying they would not be pursuing their offer at that time but ‘thank you for getting in touch.’ The duo were arrested after Miss Ecclestone called police when Rose out of the blue tweeted her 19 days later saying: “Hi stranger, long time. What’s up?” Miss Ecclestone confronted her blackmailers in court last week and said Rose was her only boyfriend to ever go to the press about her. Giving evidence from the witness box she said she first heard of the plot from The Sun journalist Alex West at a charity event at Great Ormond Street Hospital in November 2011. She told the court: 'I asked if it was Johnny Ketterman and he replied ""yes, but don’t worry, The Sun wasn’t going to run any story"". 'I thought it was him partly because Johnny had sold a story on me previously and I’ve never had a boyfriend sell a story on me before, and because of the physical description that Alex West described to me and what his character was like.' The message was timed to coincide with the second episode of a three-part series on Miss Ecclestone aired on TV. Target: Tamara Ecclestone was told to pay the £200,000 or face 'intimate details' being revealed in the national press . Defendant: Prosecutors claimed Rose was the 'driving force' behind the plot and planned to keep £150,000 if they were successful . When police raided Rose's home in . Camden, north London, they found a box marked 'Tamara' which had a . letter he had once sent to Mr Ecclestone along with holiday photos and . press cuttings about his former flame. On trial: Jakir Uddin has been accused of helping an ex-fiance of socialite Tamara Ecclestone blackmail her for £200,000 by claiming he would sell his story to a newspaper . Asked why he kept them, he said: . 'That’s my mum. Every time Tamara’s in the papers or on the news she . feels the need to bring them round. 'I kept them so I had a story. If I ever showed it back to my grandkids I can say I used to go out with Tamara Ecclestone.' Rose, . whose name was Jonathan Ketterman at the time he dated Miss Ecclestone, . also sold a 'kiss-and-tell' story to the Mail on Sunday to get back at . her for cheating on him, the court heard. He said: 'But the journalists weren’t interested in Tamara, they were interested in Bernie. 'They . were very clever and asked me questions about Bernie as well as Tamara, . about Bernie getting beat up in a car once when we went to the cinema. In fact the story ended up being about Bernie rather than Tamara. 'It made me look stupid and I’ve regretted it ever since. Obviously the £10,000 I got was nothing.' Precise details of the story Rose planned to sell were not revealed . during the trial, though jurors saw the full content of the e-mail sent . to Ms Malmstrom. Sun reporter Alex West and photographer Louis Wood were approached at a . hotel in London on November 13 with a video of Rose talking about Miss . Ecclestone. Rose, who has a 13-year-old son and changed his name from Jonathan . Ketterman to Derek Rose in August 2011, sold a lurid story about Miss . Ecclestone’s private life to the Mail on Sunday for £10,000, printed on . August 21, 2002, the court heard. He said he had been left ‘heartbroken, upset and destroyed’ after he discovered she had cheated on him. Guilty; The jury at Southwark Crown Court agreed today that Derek Rose has tried to blackmail MissEcclestone by threatening to sell 'intimate secrets' about their sex life . Jurors are continuing to consider a verdict on Coventry University media . studies student Jakir Uddin, 20, who is accused of helping Rose carry . out the plan. 'Dana Malmstrom, My name is Jakir Uddin and I’m the official representative of Jonathan Ketterman, the former fiance of Tamara Ecclestone. 'As you can imagine since Tamara Ecclestone’s show was aired my client has been inundated with offers from a lot of major tabloids, plus TV and radio. 'Whilst my client has not talked about Tamara in 10 years and has left her to live her life while he has lived his on Monday this week one of the UK’s biggest tabloids with a life-changing offer of £200,000 to go ahead with the story and disclose all.' Rose added: 'When we broke up I was quite bitter and I wanted to get back at her for breaking my heart at the time'. When interviewed by police he told how he faxed a letter to the socialite and her billionaire father after she dumped him in 2002. Rose said: 'I think I might have got a bit racial at one stage about the guy I believe she was cheating on me with so I faxed it to Bernie and to her, but I never heard anything back.' Prosecutors claim Jakir Uddin, 20, sent an email to Miss Ecclestone’s then manager Dana Malmstrom in November 2011 pretending to be co-defendant Derek Rose’s official representative. In it he claimed a tabloid newspaper had offered Rose, 33, who went out with Miss Ecclestone, 28, when she was 17, £200,000 for details of their relationship. But no newspaper had made such an offer. Giving evidence Uddin told jurors he had looked up to Rose, who was more than 12 years his senior. Uddin said Rose had helped with the lifestyle magazine he had set up with a friend while studying at Coventry University. The older man had introduced him to celebrities and given him advice drawn from his own experience in working in the media industry, Uddin told the court. 'I regarded him as someone with a high status in the media,' he said. Uddin told jurors he had filmed Rose talking about his relationship with the eldest daughter of Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone for a university project. But Uddin said that when it was rejected by his tutor, Rose suggested to him that they offered it to the newspapers. 'I saw it as a sort of favour for Mr Rose,' he said. Both men blame each other over the scheme. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Derek Rose, 33, sobbed when found guilty of blackmailing the socialite .

Three boys who beat a homeless man to death for a dare were convicted of murder yesterday. The teenagers - two aged 14 and a 17-year-old who cannot be named because of their ages - attacked Kevin Bennett, 53, as he slept rough outside a supermarket in Liverpool. Mr Bennett died in hospital six days after the beating in the early hours of August 17 last year. During their trial at Liverpool Crown Court, the jury was told the 17-year-old had goaded one of the 14-year-olds in to the attack by saying: 'I bet you haven’t got it in you to do him in'. The court heard the younger boy later told his friend: 'I started kicking him, I booted him and now he’s dead'. The second 14-year-old acted as a look-out as the attack took place, the prosecution said. The three boys had denied murder but were convicted today by a unanimous jury of seven women and five men following 13 hours of deliberations after a four week trial.

In the 1973 cult horror movie The Wicker Man, the pagan residents of a remote Highlands village end up sacrificing a devout Christian policeman as an expression of their religious freedom. More than 40 years later, developers who are planning to buy the last remaining church in the village where the film was made should hope the real-life locals don't feel inclined to take inspiration. The congregation of Plockton Church in the far north west of Scotland are furious at plans by the Church of Scotland (CoS) to sell their last place of worship. Ominous: Edward Woodward as Sergeant Howie in the 1973 film The Wicker Man which was partly filmed in the Highlands village of Plockton . The village where Robin Hardy filmed the classic tale once had four churches and open-air communions have been held to mark important Christian occasions for centuries. The religious tension over the fate of the last-remaining church, built in 1823, is all the more palpable because the followers are part of a breakaway group which split from the CoS in the the mid-19th century known as the 'Wee Frees'. They have been leasing the church for the last 20 years - but are now set be left homeless after CoS bosses decided it should be sold. Villagers believe it will follow a similar fate of other churches and be turned into flats by a property developer. They are all the more angry as it is unclear whether the graveyard will be included in the sale. Under threat: Plockton Church is set to be sold by the Church of Scotland after being deemed 'surplus to requirements' Remote: A dawn view of Plockton village in the the north west corner of Scotland where The Wicker Man was filmed . Charlie MacRae, who lives in the same Plockton home he was born in 75 years ago, told The Guardian: 'Over 20 years ago the local free church was sold and turned into flats... It would be a disaster if Plockton Church went the same way. 'The community would also like to know what will happen to the graveyard as it is unclear whether it will be included in the sale.' He added that local people would try to raise funds to buy Plockton Church if it goes on the market, but fears thy will be outbid by developers. But Rev Roddie Rankin, from Plockton Church, said he was 'hopeful'  services will continue. A CoS spokesman told The Guardian: 'Sadly the building is surplus to the congregation's requirements and as such is being sold. 'The Church of Scotland has corresponded with representatives of the local community council regarding the sale of the church and with the local free church congregation who are using the building for public worship. No final decision has been made about the future ownership of the graveyard.'","Plockton Church in north west of Scotland to be sold .

Outgoing: Phil Bentley, managing director of British Gas, will leave the business in June with a total package of £10m in pay, shares and pension pot . British Gas has provoked fury after it refused to rule out putting up its prices on the day it revealed it made a 'staggering' £50 profit from every household last year. Its £606million haul in 2012 will be used to help fund a £10million package in pay, shares and pension pot for departing boss Phil Bentley, who will leave the business in June. After making so much money last year MPs and consumer groups have called on the energy giant to cut bills for its 8.4million customers. They imposed a six per cent increase last November, which added £80 to the annual average gas and electricity bill. But British Gas has refused to rule out putting prices up again next winter, filling consumers with 'resentment and dread', critics have said. This morning the company revealed its profits for 2012 soared by 11 per cent on the previous year to £606million, while owner Centrica did even better, with a 15 per cent gain to roughly £2.8billion. Len McCluskey, Unite general secretary, said: 'British Gas' owner Centrica is making £50 per household in this country - that is staggering. 'These profits will anger a growing number of families who are struggling to pay the bills. 'The price increases in November caused hardship for customers while British Gas bosses boosted their profits and their own bonuses in the process.' Audrey Gallacher, Director of Energy . at campaign group Consumer Focus, said: 'This announcement comes after . more price rises last year, record numbers in fuel poverty and not long . after the energy regulator warned of higher still energy prices for the . foreseeable future. ‘We should not be surprised if . consumers regard these results, and the warning of price rises to come, . with a mix of resentment and dread'. Centrica’s top five executives will also collect a shares windfall predicted to top £10million. Company chiefs will be given millions of shares under a long-term bonus scheme set up three years ago, which is linked to the firm’s performance. Bosses will benefit from the fact that they will not receive the shares until after the end of the current tax year. As a result, they will cash in on Chancellor George Osborne’s cut in the top rate of tax from 50 per cent to 45 per cent. Sharp rise: Total profits at British Gas have soared by 11% in a year after imposing huge price increases . Graph: British Gas have released this chart today explaining its costs but consumers are finding its increasing profits hard to swallow . Shadow Energy Secretary Caroline Flint . said of the anticipated price rise: 'Only a few months ago they [British . Gas] decided to put prices up, event though their profits have gone up . extremely well in the last year.' Ms Flint told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was 'interesting' that shares would not be paid out to bosses until after April 1 and the introduction of the Mr Osborne's tax cut. She said British Gas was quick to put its prices up when wholesale gas prices increased, but when wholesale costs go down it is not reflected in customers' bills. 'We don't see the reverse happening,' she said, and called for the introduction of a tough regulator to ensure that savings in wholesale gas prices were passed on to customers. 'It's about fair prices and the public not feeling manipulated,' said Ms Flint, adding that the market was 'not as competitive as it should be'. 'So much energy is controlled by the big six, small companies can't come in,' she said. 'It's a closed market, that is the problem.' Alex Brummer, the Daily Mail's City Editor, told the programme the staggering payouts to Centrica bosses were not acceptable for what is essentially a utility firm. The UK’s biggest energy supplier put up tariffs six per cent in the teeth of the winter chill, pushing up bills by £80 to an average £1,350 a year. Directors from the company appeared on television this morning to defend the results. Chris Jansen, managing director of services and commercial at Centrica, said a colder winter last year contributed to the rise in profits. 'I completely understand our profits announced today will create a reaction with customers,' he told Daybreak. 'I think it’s important to remember that in 2011 it was a very, very mild winter ... so the country used a lot less gas, and actually our profits in 2011 were 20 per cent down on 2010.' Another price increase: British Gas is today expected to warn of another punishing energy price hike despite a massive surge in profits . Regulation: Tough regulation is needed to ensure savings on wholesale gas prices are passed on to the customer, said shadow Energy Secretary Caroline Flint . Asked whether customers would face . further price increases, Mr Jansen replied: 'It’s impossible for me to . say that, that’s like looking at a crystal ball. The winter price hikes by the 'Big Six' energy firms provide an opportunity to take control of your bills and save, explains Simon Lambert. An online comparison is the best way to do this and you can find the cheapest energy supplier for you by using our fuel bills switching service, powered by Energy Helpline. The biggest savings of about £300 a year can be achieved by those who have never switched. Most others can also save on bills. Simply enter your postcode into the box below and allow it to do the work for you. Five tricks to remember . 1. Take regular meter readings rather than relying on an estimate. This keeps you as close as possible to an accurate bill . 2. Move to online bills. This saves up to 10%. 3. Monthly direct debit payments could save you 5-10% . 4. Dual fuel (gas and electricity from the same supplier) is usually but not always the cheapest option. Compare both this and separate gas and electricity. 5. Knowing how much you pay now or how much energy you use delivers the best comparison. Get your most recent bill and use the figures. 'The . general trend for energy prices are prices are increasing. All we say . to customers is let’s do what we can to control energy bills. 'Prices might be going up but bills don’t need to if we control our energy use.' Ian Peters, managing director of residential energy for British Gas, told the BBC: 'If I look into the future we have no plans to put prices up even higher, the gas prices are relatively calm.' Asked on BBC Breakfast how long into the future - and if the firm was committing to not putting prices up - he said: 'I can’t do that because the gas market is volatile. 'But right now, as I say, it is very early in the year, we work in a very competitive market and it is not in our interest or our customers’ to put prices up. So we will do everything we can not to do that. 'What I want to say is that we will move heaven and earth to keep our customers’ bills down. We have the lowest bills in the industry.' Alastair Buchanan, head of energy regulator Ofgem, has warned of an energy crisis as Britain becomes more reliant on expensive imported gas. Price rises will also go to subsidies for wind farms, nuclear power stations and free insulation for the vulnerable. According to Centrica’s accounts, its chief executive Sam Laidlaw, finance chief Nick Luff, head of energy Mark Hanafin and the head of its US arm, Chris Weston, will gain from the shares bonanza. Company sources said the shares are part of a long-term incentive, not a windfall, while the date of the hand-over was decided long before the 50 per cent tax rate was scrapped. Centrica has tried to pre-empt a furore over pay with a study on its positive impact. Mr Laidlaw said: ‘At a time of uncertain economic prospects, our activities across the UK are even more important to secure employment, put the supply chain to work and contribute our fair share of tax.’ The company employs some 33,000 people in the country, while its tax bill is expected to be around £1.1billion in 2012. Unlike many rivals, it is wholly British and pays its tax here. Richard Lloyd, executive director at consumer champion, Which?, said: ‘People are bound to question whether they’re paying a fair price for energy when they see big profits announcements. 'Centrica’s analysis won’t change that view as record-high bills land on millions of doormats.'","Company profits for 2012 have soared to £606million .

Iran has activated a heavy-water production plant to produce plutonium for a nuclear bomb, it was claimed last night. Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency have been banned from scrutinising the heavily-guarded Arak facility for the past 18 months. But satellite images made public yesterday show clouds of steam emerging from the site, which is 150 miles south-west of the capital Tehran. Inspectors have been barred from scrutinising the heavy-water production plant in Arak for the past 18 months . The images emerged as the world’s leading countries resumed talks yesterday with Iran over its nuclear project, which the Islamic regime says is for peaceful purposes. The talks in Kazakhstan were the first in eight months between Iran and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany. Western diplomats described the first day of the two day talks as ‘useful’. But they said Iranian negotiators did not immediately respond to demands that Tehran closes its underground nuclear facility Fordow . near the holy city of Qom, which is at  the centre of their concerns. The satellite images showed the site surrounded by anti-aircraft missiles and other military.

For years, the powers had attempted a mix of economic pressure and . diplomacy to persuade Iran to scale back its atomic work, but Tehran has . insisted that sanctions are lifted before it complies with any demands. A Western official says the latest round of talks between world powers and Iran over Tehran's nuclear program have ended. It was not immediately clear what, if anything, was resolved in during the two days of negotiations that ended Wednesday. But Iranian state TV reported that technical experts for each side will meet in Istanbul in coming weeks to discuss the latest proposals. Iran's top negotiator, Saeed Jalili, and EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton were expected to talk to reporters later. The Western official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief the media. 'It is clear that nobody expects to come from Almaty with a fully done . deal,' the EU spokesman, Michael Mann, said before the meeting started. Iran has told the IAEA that it will begin operating the reactor at Arak . in the first three months of 2014 - a time when many believe will push . Israel into a first strike response. And though Tehran still lacks the technology to reprocess plutonium and . use it for a  weapon, North Korea has successfully developed that . technology and some analysts speculate that Iran could do the same. Major powers offered Iran limited sanctions relief in return for a halt . to the most controversial part of its atomic work during the first day . of the nuclear talks, and Iran promised to respond with a ‘proposal on . the same scale’. Last month Iran denied reports of a major explosion at its Fordow nuclear facility, one of its most sensitive uranium enrichment sites. The . country described the claims as Western propaganda which it said . is intended to influence upcoming international nuclear negotiations. The . reports originated with Israeli intelligence sources in Tel Aviv, who spoke of an explosion damaging the Fordow bunker . which is situated deep under a mountain near the religious city of Qom. In late 2011 Fordow began producing . uranium enriched to 20 percent fissile purity - below the 90 per cent . level used in nuclear bombs, but very high compared with the 3.5 percent . level needed for nuclear energy plants. The Islamic state says it is producing . 20 percent uranium to make fuel for a research reactor in Tehran that . produces medical isotopes, but the move provoked fears that the uranium could be converted to bomb-grade. Several U.N. Security Council resolutions have ordered Iran to suspend all uranium enrichment.","Inspectors have been barred from Arak facility for past 18 months .

Nearly three quarters of British people are in favour of legalising assisted suicide according to a new poll - which shows strong support for a change in the law across Europe. The survey, carried out on behalf of the Swiss Medical Lawyers Association . (SMLA), found large majorities in the 12 west European countries involved supported the right of people to choose when and how they die. Two-thirds to three-quarters of respondents said they could imagine opting for assisted suicide themselves if they suffered from an incurable illness, serious disability or uncontrollable pain. Campaign: Tony Nicklinson, who suffered from locked-in syndrome, lost a legal battle for the right to be helped to end his life when he chooses earlier this year. He died just days after the High Court judgement . In Britain, 71 per cent said they might seek assisted suicide while Greece was the most reluctant with 56 per cent saying they might do so. The practice is now allowed in only four countries on the continent, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands . and Switzerland. The German government has proposed legalising the practice as . long as no profit is involved - while France is also debating whether to allow . it. 'In practically all European countries, many signs indicate that the prevailing legal system no longer reflects the will of large parts of the population on this issue,' the SMLA said. The body said the results of its poll 'should allow politicians to take democratic principles into account when considering legislation on these issues.' Assisted suicide is now allowed only in Belgium, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Switzerland. The German government has proposed legalising it as long as no profit is involved, while France is also debating whether to allow it. Journey: Terminally ill people from Britain and other European countries have travelled to the Dignitas clinic in Zurich, Switzerland, for assistance in taking their own life . In both Germany and France, the Roman . Catholic and Protestant churches oppose legalising assisted dying and . argue for better palliative care to ease pain for dying patients. The study was conducted by the Swiss pollster Isopublic in Austria, Britain, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Sweden. It did not survey the four European countries that allow assisted suicide, or countries in eastern Europe. Decision: Daniel James died at a clinic run by Dignitas in September 2008, more than a year after a rugby accident which left him paralysed from the chest down . Germans were most in favour of the right to decide when and how they die, with 87 percent supporting the idea. Greece was the only exception to this strong support, with only 52 percent backing the idea of allowing assisted suicide. Spaniards were the most willing to consider asking for help to die, with 78 percent support, followed closely by Germans (77 percent) and the French (75 percent). More than three-quarters of those . polled in all countries said only doctors or trained practitioners . should perform assisted suicides. A majority of all respondents said . doctors should not lose their licenses if they help a patient die. Results ranged from 84 percent in Britain to 58 percent in Greece. About 30 percent of those polled thought dying patients might occasionally be pressured by relatives or doctors into accepting assisted suicide if it is legalised, while roughly 30 percent thought this would almost never happen. In Germany, where the government's bill is now being debated in parliament, 76 percent said the proposed law was wrong to ban assisted suicide if the doctor is paid for the service. The bill would not punish those helping patients commit suicide, for example by accompanying them to Switzerland where assisted suicide has been legal since 1942. A rise in the number of foreigners - particularly from Germany, France and Britain - ending their lives there has prompted calls for tighter laws, but Zurich voters rejected in 2010 a proposed ban on what opponents called 'suicide tourism.' In the United States, assisted suicide is allowed in Oregon, Washington and Montana. Massachusetts voters narrowly defeated a proposal to legalise it there this month.","Survey shows majority support for 'right to die' legislation in 12 European countries .

A man threatened to kill his partner while savagely beating her with a beer bottle, before fleeing on a bus clad only in a pair of boxer shorts. James O'Neill, 46, attacked Hazell Peters 'completely out of the blue' with a Buddha-shaped bottle as she was lying on their bed watching Emmerdale.

He was later arrested after being spotted half naked on a bus. O'Neill was jailed for over 12 years at Preston Crown Court for the attack on his 51-year-old partner, which left her needing more than 60 stitches to her head, face and arm, along with a broken bone in her ear and a perforated ear drum.

'He kept hitting me and hitting me,' Ms Peters said of the ordeal on September 13 last year. 'He wanted me to die. I didn't think he was ever going to let me out. 'I was pleading with him to stop but he was determined to kill me. I don't . know why, he didn't seem angry, he just wanted to hurt me,' she said. It was only when she told him that her grandson would soon be arriving at their home that O'Neill relented. 'It was the only way I could think to get him to leave me alone,' said Ms Peters. 'Denton would come to us every Friday afternoon after school. He wasn't coming that week, but James didn't know that. It worked. It was almost like someone had flicked a switch.' Recovery: Ms Peters, who needed more than 60 stitches after the 15 minute attack, has welcomed her former partner's 12 year jail sentence . O'Neill jumped up from the bed and stripped down to his boxer shorts before ordering Ms Peters to take off her clothes. 'I did what he told me, because I had no idea what he was going to do next,' she said.'There was blood everywhere, it had splattered up the walls and my clothes were drenched. He said that we needed to clean up and he began wiping the walls with his t-shirt.' Ms Peters managed to grab a jumper and run outside, where a passing motorist spotted the bleeding woman and called the emergency services. When police arrived at the house O'Neill had fled, but he was picked up by officers after being spotted on a bus wearing just his boxer shorts. An original charge of attempted murder was changed to a section 18 wounding offence at an earlier hearing at Preston Crown Court. O'Neill pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 12 years and eight months in jail. Ms Peters said she was 'really pleased' with the sentence. DC Ian Cartwright, of Lancashire Police's Public Protection Unit, said: 'This was a vicious attack that left the victim fearing for her life. 'She is still suffering after the incident and, while most of her physical injuries are healing, she has found her confidence greatly shaken. 'Victims of domestic violence should know that the police take this kind of crime very seriously and we will not only do all we can to bring an offender to justice but to provide help and support to the victim so that they can find the path away from their abusive situation.'","James O'Neill hit partner with Buddha-shaped bottle she kept as ornament .
