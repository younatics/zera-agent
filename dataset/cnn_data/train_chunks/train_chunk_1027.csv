"When Sarah and Peter Krstic's daughter Aria was born eight weeks early, the couple were overcome with shock and worry. For Mr Krstic the situation was particularly traumatic because he knew the risks of premature birth all too well – he himself was born three months early 31 years before. 'He's always been told growing up of the stories of him when he was a premature baby and his parents going to visit him in hospital for months,' Mrs Krstic told Daily Mail Australia. Peter and Sarah Krstic, from Golden Grove in Adelaide, with daughter Aria who was born eight weeks early . When Mr Krstic was born  he was also premature - born three months early due to a condition that causes extremely high blood pressure and can lead to seizures and organ failure . 'His dad's wedding band fit around his thigh. 'If you're always told those stories it becomes real when you have a premature baby.' Mrs Krstic, 31, from Golden Grove in Adelaide, had a complicated pregnancy because she suffered from the condition placenta previa. Her placenta totally covered her cervix giving her no way to have a natural delivery. 'I was sort of in and out of hospital throughout the pregnancy with bleeding and then was already in hospital when I had another episode and they just decided to deliver her at 32 weeks,' Mrs Krstic said. 'I'm the optimist but my husband's the pessimist and he was just completely scared. Mrs Krstic, 31, had a complicated pregnancy with Aria because she suffered from placenta previa . When Aria was born she had jaundice and had to be placed in a head box to concentrate the oxygen around her so she could breathe . 'He was just thinking ""Are we going to survive this with a baby to take home?"" and it was quite traumatic and scary because it was quite dangerous for us.' When Aria was born she had jaundice and had to be placed in a head box to concentrate the oxygen around her so she could breathe. But Mrs Krstic said the most difficult part of the ordeal was having to leave her precious new daughter at the hospital for 19 nights while she and her husband slept at home. 'I was allowed to stay for four nights and once I recovered from my caesarean, you know, they can't just keep us there to be with our baby,' she said. 'It's a hard thing to explain because you have this beautiful little girl who completes your family, and you're so excited to meet her and going through all these emotions because you're absolutely falling in love. Aria (left) was conceived via IVF like her older brother Nate, two, which Mrs Krstic says makes premature birth more likely . Aria is now a healthy, happy baby and is about to celebrate her first birthday . 'But you're scared for her too… You have this perfect baby who is just wonderful but you can't bring her home.' Mrs Krstic says that in terms of premature births, her family was fortunate. Many don't survive and if they do they usually have to stay in hospital until the date they were originally due. 'We were lucky, she was eight weeks early and was only there two and a half weeks,' she said. 'My husband was in hospital for three months.' Mrs Krstic is sharing her family's story ahead of Walk For Prems Day this Sunday, to help raise awareness for Life's Little Treasures Foundation which she says was an important source of support and information following Aria's birth. Mrs Krstic says that in terms of premature births, her family was fortunate . She still doesn't know what caused her condition, but she does not believe it was genetic as the reasons for Mr Krstic and Aria's premature births were unrelated. Mrs Krstic says the fact Aria was conceived through IVF made her more prone to giving birth prematurely, but her older son Hugh was also conceived through IVF and was born at full term. Aria is now a healthy, happy baby and is about to celebrate her first birthday. 'She's hitting all her milestones,' Mrs Krstic said. 'She's definitely doing everything that she should and she's crazy – she's going to be a little trouble maker I think.'

"A Cornish pensioner may have netted a place in the record books after hooking an 8ft-long, 221lb part-albino catfish, thought to be the biggest of its kind ever caught. The aptly named Tom Herron, 68, from Launceston, battled the cream-coloured monster fish in the River Segre, Mequinenza, Spain, for 40 minutes before finally hauling it in. But the most remarkable thing about his record-breaking catch? The previous world-beater had been caught just under two hours earlier when John Edwards, from the north of England, hauled in a 209lb catfish. That 7ft 11in fish had beaten a record set in November last year of 205lbs. Scroll down for video . What a whopper: Tom Herron poses with the 8ft, 221lb catfish he caught in the River Segre, Spain . But it was quickly eclipsed by Mr Herron's fish which, once ashore, was weighed and photographed before being released back into the river. Mr Herron, a retired printer, said the fish were wild in a deep river about 100 metres wide. 'When the fish took the bait it took me 40 minutes to haul it in, it was a nightmare,' he said. 'When its head came out of the water I thought, ""Crikey, it's enormous, about a metre wide."" 'After it had been weighed and photographed the fish was taken back into the river and released. 'It is a sport so we put them back, two of the guides stayed with the fish until they were satisfied it had enough oxygen in its lungs then they let it go. Fighter: Mr Herron battled the cream-coloured monster fish for 40 minutes before finally hauling it in . It was Mr Herron's third trip to the River Segre, which is about two hours south of Barcelona, but he says his age means it could be his last. 'From when you arrive in Barcelona you spend 18 hours a day, six days a week, on the river bank,' he said. 'From early morning you can fish until midnight.' He said his wife Deborah has not accompanied him on his trips. He said: 'It is not a holiday place, there is no shopping. 'You just go there to fish.' Conservation: The fish was weighed and photographed before being released back into the river . An expert catfish angler from Catmaster Tours, who organised the trip, said they had reeled two or three big albino catfish out of the river before, but few that had topped 200lbs. 'Albino catfish of that size are very rare indeed,' he said. 'This is the biggest we've ever seen.' Mr Herron was joined on his fishing trip by Andy Cooper, from Canworthy Water, who himself landed a 205lb specimen. The group were fishing on September 23 accompanied by their guide Ashley Scott. 'What a day it was,' said Mr Scott, adding that in all his years as a guide he had never seen a brace of part albino cats, let alone two world records.","Tom Herron from Cornwall hooked the fish in the River Segre, Spain .

"Justine Greening will today signal that Britain is to stop sending billions of pounds in foreign aid to well-off nations . International Development Secretary Justine Greening will today signal that Britain is to stop sending billions of pounds in foreign aid to well-off nations. She will tell MPs that India's controversial £280million a year aid programme will be scrapped. Miss Greening has spent several days this week brokering an end to Britain's aid programme with senior political figures in India. There had been speculation that the Government wanted to halve the subsidies, but she will tell MPs that as a result of the talks she is cancelling them altogether from 2015. Critics argue that pouring millions of pounds into relatively wealthy countries devalues the concept of aid. India's economy is growing at the rate of eight per cent a year. It spends vast sums on defence and has its own space programme. It also has its own overseas aid programme worth £328million a year. Under Labour, India became the biggest net recipient of British aid, receiving £421million in 2010. Despite India's rapid economic development, former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell decided to approve a further £1.1billion in aid over the following four years. Today's announcement is seen as the first step in Britain pulling back from its aid programmes to relatively wealthy countries. Miss Greening told last month's Tory conference: 'We should recognise that as countries get richer, we need to be responsible about how we transition in our relationship with them from aid to trade.' David Cameron has pledged to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on overseas aid. The programme will be worth £12.6 billion a year in 2014 – far more than the £12.1 billion spent on Britain's police. A Government source said: 'Justine Greening has been in India this week in talks with senior politicians in India. As a result she will end financial aid to India in 2015. 'She wanted to make the decision based on consensus, so that is why she went to talk to people there. They acknowledge that India's place in the world has changed. This is about recognising that they are a global player. They are happy that financial aid will now end. The 0.7 per cent commitment is not in question and the money will be reallocated to poorer countries.' In February, India's then finance minister Pranab Mukherjee – now the country's president – embarrassed the Government by suggesting Britain's aid payments were 'a peanut in our total development expenditure'. Last month, former UN chief  Kofi Annan backed calls for Britain and the EU to stop giving billions of pounds in aid to wealthier countries. He said booming nations such as China, Brazil and India should wean themselves off development funding so it could be targeted at 'weaker' parts of the world instead. Miss Greening has already called for the EU to stop giving aid to relatively rich nations. The UK contributes £1billion a year to the EU's aid fund. Turkey has been one of the top five recipients of EU aid money for years. In 2010 it received almost £200million, much of which was used to upgrade its sewers. Other relatively wealthy countries receiving British aid money via the EU include Serbia, Croatia and Iceland. The payments are made to help countries wanting to join the EU upgrade their infrastructure. There is no requirement to repay the money if the country later decides not to join or is refused membership . Last night a spokesman for the Department for International Development confirmed Miss Greening had been examining the issue of aid to India, but refused to comment further ahead of today's announcement. 'We cannot confirm any details,' she said.","India's controversial £280million a year aid programme is to be scrapped .

"Two Boston park rangers were stabbed Tuesday by a homeless man with a violent history at the Boston Common, the nation's oldest public park. Police Commissioner William Evans said Tuesday night that Bodio Hutchinson, 34, attacked the unarmed rangers in an unprovoked confrontation at about 4:30 pm. A 46-year-old ranger sergeant is in surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital with life-threatening injuries, Evans said. The second victim,a 23-year-old ranger new to the service, is in stable condition at Tufts Medical Center with less serious wounds. A witness says the rangers approached the man and asked him to put out his cigarette — and fight broke out when he refused, FOX 25 reported. Witnesses said . Bodio Hutchingon, 34, is led in handcuffs from the Boston Common, where police say he stabbed park rangers . Boston mounted police keep a perimeter around the scene where two park rangers were stabbed Tuesday in an unprovoked confrontation. One of the victims, a 46-year-old sergeant, is fighting for his life in the hospital . 'We run up here, we see cops —  just like, bleeding,' another eyewitness, Jackson Marchant, told the Boston Globe. 'A lot of people were helping the cops. But he was stabbed right in the central stomach, and it was bloody, it was bleeding, his whole torso was covered in red. 'He was holding himself, praying.' Witnesses say officers followed the suspect as he ran into the nearby Public Garden . 'He stopped and he told them to shoot him,' Nicholas Rusk, 19, told the Globe. 'They didn’t shoot him, they just tackled him to the ground.' Witnesses took a series of pictures of the arrest and handed them over to police. Evans said a knife police believe was used in the attack was recovered from Frog Pond. 'He’s not a newcomer, obviously, to the criminal justice system,' Evans told reporters. Evans said Hutchison faces attempted murder charges.

"Broadcast television is getting smuttier this season with x-rated jokes and photos of genitals. While broadcast networks may be using sex to sell their shows in order to compete with cable networks like HBO, they are also ruffling the feathers of concerned viewers who are calling for censorship. The Hollywood Reporter writes that the president of the Parents Television Council (PTC), Tim Winter, thinks the dirty humor is, 'absolutely inappropriate for primetime broadcast television.' Scroll down for video . New Girl: In episodes of the show New Girl starring Zooey Deschanel, the characters use terms like 'sex fist' and also smoke drugs like marijuana . To Winter's dismay, New Girl on Fox starring girl-next-door Zooey Deschanel had a fisting joke filled season premiere. Deschanel's character repeatedly uses the catchphrase 'sex first,' a term she coined to describe her roommates desire to hook up at a wedding. Other New Girl episodes feature characters doing marijuana and in one episode Deschanel dates a man with a micropenis. 'We got away with murder, The New Girl’s executive producer Brett Baer told The Hollywood Reporter. Sex scenes: The season premiere of Scandal starring Kerry Washington opens with a sex scene between her and Scott Foley, just minutes after Charlie Brown aired on ABC . 'We've given broadcast standards a run for their money,' he said. Another show on Fox called the Mindy Project has an entire episode dedicated to anal sex. Mindy Kaling and Chris Messina spend an entire show slot on broadcast television debating whether or not Messina tried to engage in anal sex with Kaling. The episode later references other nuanced sexual positions referred to as the 'necktie', 'ascot', and 'bagpipe'. The president  of the Parents Television Council (PTC) says that shows on broadcast television have become too racy and should be censored . Fox isn't the only broadcast network featuring base humor in the hopes for bigger ratings. The show Scandal on ABC started their season with a steamy sex scene between Kerry Washington and Scott Foley. The PTC complained about the intimate embrace in Scandal which aired at 9, just minutes after the Charlie Brown Halloween Special. The Hollywood Reporter says that a few weeks later the show had an episode in which the President's daughter is caught having sex with two boys online in an act called 'Eiffel Towering'. 'I have no intention of changing what's happening on Scandal at 9,' the show's writer Shonda Rhimes told The Hollywood Reporter in response to people trying to censor her. 'That will be interesting. I look forward to being censored.' Rhimes' other show, How to Get Away with Murder, which airs on ABC at 10pm has an episode in which the character Viola Davis says, 'Why is your penis on a dead girl's phone?' Low rated shows like Mindy and the New Girl may be trying to add more dirty humor to jack up the ranking, but so far the tactic hasn't been working. 'As lines blur between broadcast, basic cable and premium cable, there may be a concentration of pushing sexual boundaries in certain shows,' said a top network executive. 'But it is hardly a mandate or a trend,' he added. Tim Winter doesn't think the jokes are justified. 'We have to start asking if some of these grey area instances really do cross the line,' said Winter of the PTC. Network censors have been less stringent about pushing back and the FCC has been easier on fining shows. 'Hopefully, the FCC will levy a fine or two and let broadcasters know that the law is still in place and they have to respect it,' Winter said.","Parents Television Council (PTC) president Tim Winter thinks the dirty humor is, 'absolutely inappropriate for primetime broadcast television'

"This dramatic CCTV footage shows the moment a drunk van driver lost control of his vehicle and ploughed head-first in to a police van, leaving an officer with 'life-changing' injuries. The video was published after the driver, 28-year-old Steven King, was jailed for two and a half years at Birmingham Crown Court today. PC Arthur Klucznik was the passenger in the police van and had been dealing with a 999 call at the time. The police van that Steven King ploughed in to on April 26 - PC Arthur Klucznik was the passenger in the vehicle and suffered a serious fracture. Six months on the officer still requires crutches . The wrecked LDV Maxis work van King had driven without permission - he was twice the legal drink-drive limit when he crashed into the police van in Aston, Birmingham . The video was published after King was jailed for two and a half years at Birmingham Crown Court . The officer suffered a broken leg in the collision and had to be cut free from the wreckage. He was left trapped in the vehicle and feared it would catch fire. The court heard he may never be able to return to front-line policing again, as he can now only walk short distances without pain. King, a father-of-two, was twice the legal drink-drive limit and had hit speeds of 80mph as he raced through traffic without lights on, shortly before midnight on April 26 this year. King had hit speeds of 80mph in a 40mph zone as he raced through the traffic without lights on . As he tried to weave through the traffic, he swerved on to the opposite carriageway of the A34 Birchfield Road in Aston, Birmingham and crashed in to the police van. Prosecutor Alistair Redford told the court King had been banned from driving for being drunk behind the wheel in 2012, but that night he had taken an LDV Maxis work van without permission. Mr Redford said: 'The van was driven at speeds between 50mph and 80mph, in these sections there is a 40mph limit. 'Various witnesses described the vehicle as overtaking and cutting in front of them. Some witnesses tried to flash the driver to alert him to the fact his lights were not on. 'Because he had his lights off a vehicle pulled in front of him, the defendant braked sharply and swerved and nearly hit a wall. 'He crossed the central reservation and collided with the police vehicle which had just come out of a tunnel. It was, in effect, a head-on collision which caused the police vehicle to spin around. 'PC Klucznik was trapped and was in fear the vehicle would catch alight. The defendant was thrown through the passenger side window and suffered a broken back in seven places.' The van (pictured bottom right) starts to swerve through the traffic on a busy section of the A34 in Aston . The court heard King had been banned from driving in 2012, but took the van from work without permission . Despite his injuries, Mr Redford added, King continued to shout abuse at the officers who attended the scene and went to hospital with him. David Swinnerton, defending, said King had shown remorse for his actions and 'knew clearly' how lucky he was that he had not killed PC Klucznik or himself with his 'appalling' driving. Sentencing him to prison, Judge Melbourne Inman QC said: 'The photos vividly tell the tale of what happened. It is quite simply remarkable nobody was killed in this collision. You were a little more than twice the legal limit and were still being abusive after you were arrested. 'PC Klucznik suffered a serious fracture. Six months later he still needs crutches and the prognosis for him is still uncertain. 'The driver of the police vehicle escaped serious injury but he found it a terrifying experience which is not surprising.' King had pleaded guilty at Birmingham Crown Court to causing serious injury through dangerous driving, aggravated vehicle taking, drink driving and driving without a licence or insurance.","Steven King was jailed for two and a half years at Birmingham Crown Court .

The hat's designer, Jane Taylor, who also saw the Countess of Wessex wear one of her hats today said she was 'delighted'. 'Both the Duchess of Cambridge and the Countess of Wessex look stunning today. 'They both have a unique yet timeless sense of style and wear hats so well. 'It's the dream to have two members of they royal family wearing my pieces to such an important event.'

Seal of approval: Liz deemed today's Jubilee outfits a triumph . Well, today the boats were well and truly pushed out. For the service at St Paul’s the Queen wore a soft mint coat dress: as for the flotilla on Sunday, it is again designed by her dresser, Angela Kelly. It is of silk tulle, embroidered with flowers, using silver thread. A chiffon drape is a lovely, soft touch: it is studded with Swarovski crystals, and a matching drape adorns the hat. The Duchess of Cambridge’s nude lace dress by Sarah Burton for McQueen was tailored perfectly to fit her figure – the hem a tad longer than the red dress for the flotilla on the Thames – and while I loved it, the fastening of the belt, seemingly made from bias binding, is a little disappointing. Kate (and Sarah Burton) need to understand that the Duchess will often be seen from behind, and therefore the detailing needs to be beautiful:  pearls or diamonds, with hand embroidered loops, not just a hook and eye. and I do want to wrestle Kate out of her platform patent pumps from LK Bennett. She needs delicate lace shoes, encrusted with pearls, by Manolo Blahnik, say, or an English shoe couturier, such as Georgina Goodman. The platform is a little too casual for such a formal occasion.But Kate still looked stunning, especially as her eye make-up has been softened: I love the subtle veil over her eyes, on a hat by her favourite milliner, Jane Taylor: £790, available on the milliner’s website. The real surprise of the day was that both Beatrice and Eugenie looked fresh, young and appropriate. Beatrice wore a blue and white striped coatdress by London Fashion Week designer Kinder Aggugini. Italian born, he studied at St Martin’s, and learned his craft on Savile Row and working for designers including Vivienne Westwood and John Galliano. This dress was teamed with tan stilettos by Gina, a Stephen Jones hat and a Lemaresca bag, made by sisters Giulia and Cecilia Maresca, who worked at Tod’s and Vivienne Westwood before striking out on their own. This rock and roll bag label is made from start to finish in Italy, not merely ‘finished’ there, as so many are these days. This bag would have cost about £1,000. Princess Eugenie chose a royal purple dress by Suzannah (her lovely, small boutique is at 6 Bristol Gardens, in Little Venice); a Stephen Jones hat; Gina nude stilettos and a Loro Piana bag. I am starting to love these two young women: they champion brand new talent, know how to mix and match different labels, and have the good sense to wear Gina shoes, which are expensive but super stylish and comfy. Kate should follow suit, and abandon those high street platforms. She has such great legs: she really could take a dagger heel. Samantha Cameron wore a rose print dress by Paul Smith that we’ve seen before, but at least she wore a hat, by Stephen Jones. The Duchess of Cornwall wore a graphic, basket weave coat by Bruce Oldfield, and a ginormous Philip Treacy hat. Both items tell me she is feeling much more confident, starting to abandon those safe creams. All in all, a triumph.","Duchess and each of senior royals placed at separate tables .

"Police in Los Angeles have arrested a suspect in connection to the murder of celebrity tattoo artist Michael 'Trigz' Pebley. Robert Falcon, 31, from Sylmar, California, was arrested Tuesday and charged with murder in the October 9 shooting outside a North Hollywood store. According to investigators, Pebley and Falcon got into a verbal spat at Black Derby Smoke Shop on Laurel Canyon Boulevard, which quickly turned physical. Justice for Trgiz: A suspect has been arrested and charged with killing tattoo artist to the stars Michael 'Trigz' Pebley earlier this month . Where's it all started: Pebley got into an altercation with a Black Derby customer over a passing remark . Familiar face: Actor Carlos Ayala, long-time friend of Trigz, was outside the smoke shop paying his respects . The fight spilled out onto the sidewalk outside the business, at which point Falcon allegedly pulled out a handgun and shot Pebley. Robert Falcon is being held in jail on $2million bail, reported ABC7. According to the manager of the smoke shop, Pebley was minding his own business  when an apparent stranger upset him with a pointed remark leaving the store at around 5.40pm on October 9. Pebley, who was talking to the store owner, was angered and approached the man, 'getting in his face', which sparked a 30-second fight inside. The two men then walked outside, and the confrontation ended with Pebley being fatally shot outside the neighboring Tattoo & Body Piercing parlor. Asked what could have sparked such a violent and ultimately fatal fight, a witness said that he had been told the suspect turned to Pebley and asked him 'Where do I know you from?' 'That might may sound like nothing, but round here the way you say that could be the difference to starting a fight or not,' he said. His leading lady: Trigz was expected to marry his fiancee and the mother of his youngest daughter, Honey Miranda (right) Tragic: Michael Christopher Pebley - or Trigz - leaves behind five children, including a young daughter Vida (pictured) Personal tribute: Miranda honored her late fiance by getting his name tattooed on the back of her neck . Witness Brandon Wilmot, 22, a security officer for Valley Plaza was working opposite the shop when the shooting took place. ‘He got shot but nobody heard any of the gunshots or anything. The cops and ambulance came up and they were trying to revive him for about five minutes, then they ended up just pulling the white sheet over him,' said Wilmot. 'When I walked down the street I could see the sheet over him and see his feet sticking out. 'He was a known local person and a good guy. When the cops came the people out of the tattoo shop came out and they were hysterical. A lot of his apprentices work at that tattoo parlor.' Pebley's friend, actor Carlos Ayala, 35, said that it was 'probably fear that got Trigz killed. ‘I worked with him on many videos. I’ve known him since 2002, we did SWAT together and the video for Rick Ross’ Don’t Play No Games with Future. ‘Just because he looks how he looks people shouldn’t judge. He was a real nice guy.' Loss: Trigz with his young daughter at his tattoo parlor in North Hollywood, California . Inked: Trigz was best known as rapper Chris Brown's (right) tattoo artist . The famed tattoo artist worked with Chris Brown, Kylie Jenner's reported boyfriend Tyga as well as Amber Rose's soon-to-be-ex Wiz Khalifa and musician Travis Barker. Just after news broke of the murder, Brown tweeted, 'RIP homie. S*** it crazy!' Trigz  became part of an exclusive worldwide group of artists called The Seventh Letter, fellow member and friend Willie T told Eyewitness News. Venice photographer and skater Pep Williams announced Trigz's death on his Facebook page, saying, 'Lost another brother just a couple of hours ago. Many good memories from shooting, grubbing and hanging at the traphouse. Love you brother.' Trigz left behind his fiancee, Honey Miranda, and five children. Miranda was among the people who discovered his lifeless body on the street. He was often used as a model in music videos and in magazine shoots and was a member of the renowned Seventh Letter graffiti artist crew. Trigz, a.k.a. Mr. Trigger, worked out of Sincity Tattoo in Pacoima, where he specialized in body piercing. He had a big following: Trigz and friends with Chris Brown in an Instagram photo . Trigz’s son has started a GoFundMe account to help pay for his funeral expenses. Pebley's two sons, Michael and Anthony both expressed their pain at the death of their father by posting a picture of them both sitting on his knee dating from 1997. Michael, who has set up a GoFundMe page was equally distraught, asking friends, family and members of the public to help donate money for his father's funeral. Fathers and sons: Michael (left) and Anthony (right) sitting with their father in this picture taken around 1997 . Grief: Michael Christopher Pebley with Honey Miranda - his fiancee - in a series of pictures she uploaded to Facebook on Friday . Despite the glowing tributes paid by friends, the veteran tattoo artist was known for his checkered history with the law. As recently as 2009, Pebley, or Trigz, was incarcerated in Ironwood State Prison in Blythe serving a six year sentence for graffiti. He was arrested on 12 counts of vandalism and while he only served around 18 months, the prison sentence was seen as harsh nonetheless. Speaking to local media about his time in jail, Pebley said that prison was as good as could be expected. 'I've got some cool homies who have stayed tough for me on the streets which helps a villain keep my head high and my eyes open in this shark tank,' said Pebley. He also touched on his body art being a source of prejudice and claimed that he was dealt with differently by the courts because of them.

"To be fair, no one looks at their radiant best after a transatlantic flight. And so those new pictures of Nigella Lawson, in which she looks pale, swollen and not quite the Nefertiti beauty we would recognise from her publicity shots, may simply be a familiar story of a tiring night, crossing time zones without enough sleep or water. Nevertheless, she does appear very changed. And perhaps inevitably yesterday, on message boards across the globe, her looks were a matter of earnest debate. The use of Botox and fillers, which can combine to give a frozen and puffy appearance, was widely suspected — and indeed in many places asserted as fact. Scroll down for video . Nigella pictured on The Taste in 2013 (left) and this year looking almost unrecognisable (right) this week with a much fuller face . ‘More filler than a Lidl sausage,’ posted one person. Another said: ‘The curse of pillow face strikes again!’ One brave soul ventured to ask Nigella directly on Twitter: ‘What have you done to your gorgeous face?’ The Domestic Goddess’s reply? ‘Nothing! Damage caused by long-haul flight!’ Now, it is true that she has suffered in the past from a puffy face. Last year she was pictured getting into her car wearing a de-puffing white cotton pad under each eye — hardly the most flattering look. It is also known that Nigella has a high-maintenance beauty regime — facials, silk pillows, fancy creams and the rest — which allows her often to pass for a woman two decades younger. Nigella appearing at court after her former assistants the Grillo sisters were charged with fraud . And the fact is that it is vital for her to look her very best right now. For she is planning to make a comeback in the UK after the success of her U.S. TV show and plans for a book and a TV series here are already well-advanced. In the next few months she will deliver a manuscript to publisher Chatto & Windus. When the book, Simply Nigella, comes out and she is back on British television, she will be able to tell if the scandals of 2013 have dented her image. This, then, is a testing time for Nigella. There is a sense that she will face a moment of truth around the corner. Most TV and publishing executives believe she has emerged from her shattering divorce from art collector Charles Saatchi and the trial for fraud of her former assistants, the Grillo sisters, even more beloved than ever. Team Nigella has many supporters, ranging from her close friends actor Stephen Fry, author Salman Rushdie, heiress Jemima Khan and broadcaster Maria McErlane, to a wider fan base including David Cameron, who was famously reprimanded by the judge when he declaring that he was on her side during the Grillos’ trial. People close to Nigella say she is ‘very calm’ on the subject of whether she can still make a go of her career, and exhibits not a trace of nerves on the subject. ‘She said she can’t understand the fuss,’ said a confidant. She is, though, skittish about her looks and ageing. Posing for the cover of Vogue magazine last March, she admitted being ‘terrified’ of being pictured without make-up. ‘I hate having my looks talked up,’ she added. ‘It always makes me feel I’m going to be a disappointment in the flesh.’ As well as the appearance of her face seeming to change, Nigella's weight has fluctuated over the years that she has been in the public eye . She was wrong, of course — she looked gorgeous in Vogue and the magazine claimed only a light touch of the airbrush had been needed. In real life, though, Nigella’s hair is often less kempt than one might expect — she washes it only once a week. As far as skincare goes, she likes Vaishaly Patel facial massage and products. And Botox? She denies it had anything to do with her appearance this week. In addition, Nigella, whose weight famously yo-yos, sees a personal trainer in London who also trains Elle Macpherson. This would be a very normal beauty regime for a 54-year-old woman in the public eye. Nigella understands that her famous looks are part of her appeal. The TV cook is savvy enough to know that her looks play a large part in her success . If she wants to continue to sell books and make TV shows, she has to attend to her image — and she has no intention of retiring. Although she is said to be worth £15 million, some of her accounts show a surprisingly modest income. Figures from Nielsen Bookscan — which analyses publishing sales — show that her income from physical books this year is small — at least by the standards of a woman who, it was revealed at the Grillos’ trial, lived in a house where £25,000 was spent on flowers in 18 months. Her books in print — including those reissued this spring in new jackets as the ‘Nigella Collection’ — have notched up £170,000 in sales. She might expect to get 60 per cent of this, which is around £100,000, on which, of course, she will have to pay tax. That doesn’t amount to much if you live a life as expensive as Nigella’s, with a team of staff and daily visits to the best fishmonger and greengrocer in Chelsea. She makes more money — estimated to be ‘at least’ £500,000 a year — from sales of her Nigella’s Kitchen homewares, e-book sales and her recipe app. Her TV production company, Pabulum Productions, is in rude health, with assets of nearly £3 million. Its latest accounts, showing the year to August 2013, reveal pre-tax profits of £498,000. So Nigella has plenty to smile about, and it is clear she is loving life without her famously controlling ex-spouse. Free from Charles Saatchi, she is going out to dinner parties and other events. She was spotted at a performance in LA given by burlesque dancer Dita Von Teese — and afterwards posed for a picture with Von Teese. She posted it on Twitter, saying: ‘Difficult to have your picture taken next to the most exquisite creature on earth.’ Broadcaster Maria McErlane and documentary-maker Olivia Lichtenstein are her two main stalwarts, and her TV producer sister Horatia is also in her inner circle. Perhaps significantly, there is a growing coterie of male admirers, too, all of whom worship at the altar of Nigella. Salman Rushdie, who has taken her out for dinner in London, has adored her for more than a decade, but their relationship has always been platonic. Nigella Lawson with burlesque artist Dita Von Teese who she described as 'the most exquisite creature on earth' Then there is the life coach John Whittington, whom friends say she ‘couldn’t do without’. During the trial of the Grillo sisters in December, it was revealed that he gave Nigella therapy and was also engaged to help her staff — the so-called Team Cupcake — to work through their problems. Whittington, a tall, handsome man, lives with his business partner Loretta Roy — again there is no question of a romantic liaison. Instead, he is coaching Nigella, perennially anxious, about confidence in her personal and professional relationships. The final key ‘knight’ for Nigella is TV cook Anthony Bourdain, her co-host on U.S. television. He is enormously loyal to her, as he has made clear to their bosses at ABC who have had their doubts. Nigella has emerged stronger from her trials and tribulations over the past year, partly due to Team Nigella which includes actor Stephen Fry and heiress Jemima Khan . When she was banned from entering the U.S. because of her past drug use, he tweeted: ‘I am absolutely mortified with embarrassment over the cruelty and hypocrisy of U.S. actions re: #Nigella travel. Unbelievable.’ Bourdain, who is happily married, has the kind of global profile which Nigella envies. While in LA, she was filming The Taste for ABC with Bourdain — the show is now in its third series in America but failed to get traction on Channel 4 when it was trialled over here. Other new members of her circle are the once troubled Hollywood actor Robert Downey Jr, who asks her for pie recipes, and Lena Dunham, actress and writer of the hit U.S. TV show Girls. And so, with friends in high places, a new publishing deal and TV appearances on both sides of the Atlantic, Nigella marches on. In the circumstances, who could blame her for looking a little strained?","Nigella has a high-maintenance beauty regime using facials and silk pillows .

"A new novel about a predatory female teacher who preys on young boys has been banned in some book shops and branded 'disgusting' by those shocked by its graphic sexual content. Tampa, by U.S. author Alissa Nutting, tells the story of the 'insatiable' eight-grade teacher Celeste Price, 26. She has a 'husband who is devoted to her' but has a 'singular sexual obsession - 14-year-old boys'. In fact, she only chose the teaching profession so she could get close to school boys and the novel unfolds with sexual scenes of her seducing her pupils and caring 'nothing for anyone or anything but her own pleasure'. Causing controversy: Author Alissa Nutting has written a book that has been banned in some shops and she won't let her parents read it . Cosmopolitan have described the book as a 'twisted tale' and 'the sickest, most controversial book of the summer' and it has been banned in some Australian book stores. Nutting, a new mother, has forbidden her own Catholic parents from reading it and has admitted some of the abuse she has received from outraged readers has been 'difficult'. But she told The Times the whole point of the book is to shock and offer a 'social satire' on the way male victims of predatory teachers are treated by society in comparison to females. She said: 'When these cases occur there is all this ""nudge, nudge, wink, wink, what a lucky boy."" Gender differences: Nutting said the cases of teachers Debra Lafave, left, and Jeremy Forrest, who both had relationships with their students, were handled differently by society . 'It's one thing for an adult male to think, 'gee, she looks great, I'd like to have sex with her' - assuming the boy is able to consent as we are, which I think is untrue. When the victim is female we don't do any of that.' She points out that when the victim is a male, the tendency is for people to think he wanted the attention from the teacher because he's an adolescent with raging hormones. Whereas female victims are always seen to be 'taken advantage of'. 'We eroticise the (female) teacher. I'd like to guide the . reader into understanding how uncomfortable and upsetting that tendency . is' This has been shown in the British press recently with the case of married teacher, Jeremy Forrest, who was jailed for running away with a 15-year-old pupil. There has been numerous cases of female teachers seducing school boys but these do not get the same coverage or condemnation according to Nutting. She said: 'I wanted to satirise the ways that these cases are received in society. Always looking to excuse the woman rather than looks at it as a criminal case, the way we do with men.' Explicit: Tampa is about a female teacher obsessed with having sex with teen boys . She said through the sexual content . in her book and the extreme character of Celeste - who won't even have . children because she's scared she'd want to have sex with her son when . he's a teen - she wants to change people's way of thinking when the . seducer of a pupil is a woman and not a man. She explained: 'Portions of the book will shock and should shock. That's what's missing from these cases. 'We eroticise the (female) teacher, fetishise them, use them for our own arousal. I'd like to guide the reader into understanding how uncomfortable and upsetting that tendency is.' Nutting's inspiration came from the media attention surrounding the case of Debra Lafave, a teacher in Florida who pleaded guilty in 2005 to having sex with a 14-year-old boy. Nutting had gone to school with Lafave and was alarmed at how in the press coverage, more focus was made on the fact she was an attractive blonde (often pictured in a bikini) than on her crimes. Implying the school boy had 'got lucky' rather than been abused. She said: 'With a boy, the reaction is so extreme as to have people say no crime was committed - 'what a wonderful learning experience, it will make him more popular'. 'If the table were turned, those comments would be so obviously appalling.'","Tampa, by U.S. author Alissa Nutting, has caused controversy .

"Almost 200 prisoners, including dozens of violent offenders, have been let out of jail to learn how to drive, ministers have admitted. A total of 190 offenders were given temporary release for driving lessons or tests in 2013, including robbers, drug dealers and fraudsters. Labour warned the lessons, designed to rehabilitate offenders, could spark public fears that prisons are ‘taking a big risk with their safety’. A total of 190 inmates were given day release to learn how to drive last year, including dozens of violent and serious offenders . New figures released in Parliament reveal details of the offenders allowed to walk out of prison to be taught how to drive. They include 89 held on violent offences, 51 for drugs, 29 for robbery, five for theft, three for fraud and two behind bars for burglary. The government argues that temporary release can help prepare inmates for the outside world when they come to the end of their sentence. Most prisoners must pay for their own lessons and the cost of applying for a driving licence. But ministers admitted that in some cases the costs could be picked up by the taxpayer. The figures were released in response to a parliamentary question by Labour MP Stephen Doughty. Labour’s shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said: ‘The public will be concerned that releasing prisoners to do driving tests is taking a big risk with their safety. Some of the prisoners let out are inside for serious and violent crimes. ‘It’s absolutely crucial that ministers look into this to ensure everything possible is being done to make sure that no risk is being taken with the public’s safety.’ Shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan warned of the risk to public safety . A new report this warned fights and assaults are a daily occurrence in the nation's prisons with unprecedented levels of violence. The chief inspector of prisons Nick Hardwick suggested that the rise in problems in jails could be linked to government reforms and spending cuts, a claim disputed by the government. Mr Khan added: ‘There is enormous pressure in the prisons service caused by the government’s policies so we need guarantees that corners aren't being cut with this. ‘We cannot have the wrong kinds of prisoners might be let out, which would be a disaster. We need urgent reassurances that isn’t happening.’ The coalition government has repeatedly claimed to be making life in prisons tougher, removing perks for inmates. But the number of prisoners being given release for driving lessons has fallen by just 25 since 2008. Prisons minister Andrew Selous said: ‘Temporary release can be an important tool in helping prisoners to re-adjust safely and productively to life in the community. ‘It is allowed to prisoners only towards the end of their time in custody and only after a thorough risk assessment.’ He stressed that changes are being made to temporary release to ‘give even greater weight to public protection and the need for prisoners to demonstrate how the release will aid their rehabilitation and increase their chances of leading a crime free life on release’. Driving lessons are only allowed if the licence is required to help their rehabilitation, such as improving their chances of getting a job.","Almost 4 offenders a week allowed out to be taught how to drive .

"Father and doctor Ian Davis is in a race against time, before his body and eventually his life succumb to the aggressive, motor neurone disease. The Melbourne medicine man had dreams of one day curing leukaemia but after being diagnosed with the terrible disease three years ago, he had to give up work and concentrate his time with his family, wife Mel and newborn son Archie. But while his future is grim he has vowed to continue living his life to the fullest. Scroll down for video . Dr Ian Davis (pictured) was in his prime when diagnosed with motor neuron disease .

Dr Davis also took on the MND ice bucket challenge and he did it in the nude, while one of his most memorable times taking the stage in a wheelchair with Pearl Jam, his favourite band. 'I've never hit a tambourine so hard in my life,' he said. He also made his own brand of beer, Cavalier Courage, with the profits to go to motor neurone disease research. Dr Ian Davis (pictured) who was diagnosed with MND three years ago survived to see the birth of his son Archie (pictured) When Dr Ian Davis (pictured left) was diagnosed with motor neurone disease he had to eventually give up working to find a cure for Leukaemia and spend time with his family including wife Mel (pictured right) But his biggest achievement whilst tackling the cruel disease, that has ravaged his body, was surviving to see his baby son Archie born. 'I never thought I would be a dad and to now finally see him in the flesh and to know that half of me is in there, and that'll be there after I'm gone is pretty exciting and I'm pretty proud of him.' Another challenge for Ian has been a tandem Odyssey with mate and father of two Scott Sullivan, who also had the disease.

"On the run: Suspected cop-killer Eric Frein remains at large in the Poconos after a search Sunday failed to turn up signs of the self-taught survivalist . Authorities searching for suspected cop killer Eric Frein are believed to have found a handwritten note penned by the suspect. The letter, discovered as the manhunt for the survivalist sniper entered its fourth week, is being considered a confession, reports suggest. It details the the shooting of two Pennsylvania state troopers last month and then goes on to talk extensively about the escape, according to CNN. However the note doesn't reveal a motive and it doesn't seem to explain why he wanted to go on the run and hide out in the woods on the Monroe and Pike County borders. It wasn't clear where it was found, but sources told the station that the detail it goes into suggests it was written by the suspect. Frein, 31, is of killing Cpl. Bryon Dickson  and injuring Trooper Alex T. Douglass during an ambush at the Pennsylvania State Police barracks in Blooming Grove on September 12th. Since then, a number of agencies have been involved in the search, including the FBI and state police, but he has continued to evade capture. State police spokesman Trooper Tom Kelly issued a statement on Monday saying that he could not confirm the letter or any information provided by unnamed sources. It is not the first item that Frein has left behind since the search began. Police have found two pipe bombs at a campsite used by Frein and have found 90 rounds from a rifle of the type used in the ambush. They've also found tuna fish, ramen noodles and other food and clothing. This latest blow to the search for Frein comes following a possible sighting of the suspect on Sunday, that narrowed the search area to just a one square mile-and-a-half area. However Pennsylvania State Police spokeswoman Trooper Connie Devens said the identification was not positive. 'The search teams are following up on a possible sighting by law enforcement in the area from earlier this afternoon,' she said. 'And other teams that are searching in other areas of Price and Barrett Townships.' Scroll down for video .

The 31-year-old has been on the run in the Poconos since September 12, when he shot and killed a state trooper and wounded another . Wanted: Frein was taught how to shoot a gun by his father, a retired Army major, and is a self-trained survivalist. Above, a wanted ad for the shooting suspect pictured above near a trail entrance in Canadensis, Pennsylvania . 'One of the things he seems to be surviving on predominantly would be cans of tuna fish and ramen noodles,' said Lr. Col. George Bivens. Bivens said seizing these supplies is crucial, as Frein does not appear to be trying to live off the land. 'I believe his food is running out and we've seized a big amount of it,' he said. Frein learned how to shoot from his father, who is a retired Army major, and is a self-trained survivalist.

"A desperate graduate whose video interview as comedy legend David Brent went viral has bagged a chance at his dream job. Will Bower, 21, finished his Business and Management Studies degree at the University of Sussex this summer and graduated with a 2:1. But Will, from Crawley, West Sussex, struggled to secure work after graduating, despite applying for numerous jobs. In a bid to stand out from the crowd, he uploaded a video interview to his website recruitwill.com turning to The Office character, played by comedian Ricky Gervais, for inspiration. The video caught the comedian's attention and several companies, including VCCP - one of London's top advertising agencies. The CEO of the firm offered Will the chance to come into the office to have a tour before giving him a month's trial at his company - which he started today. Scroll down for video . Speak to the hand: In the video, Mr Bower uses his hand to portray other people asking him questions . Will's video, which sees him answer a number of questions from a pretend interviewer, went viral and was even retweeted by Ricky Gervais. Will said: 'I posted the video online and the video immediately went viral, the coverage just snowballed from there. 'After the video was posted online I was contacted by more than 20 companies and was offered a month's trial because of the video. 'Even Ricky Gervais retweeted a link to the story and it was then seen by his 2.3 million followers. The 21-year-old, who finished his Business and Management Studies degree at the University of Sussex, has been unable to secure work, despite graduating with a 2:1 . 'I contacted the CEO at VCCP and he was very impressed with what I had done and invited me to have a tour of the office - he then offered me a trial. 'I was delighted but I am now feeling a mixture of nerves and excitement. 'Finding a job is very tough at the moment, there are thousands of graduates with similar degrees, so I had to do something different to get noticed. 'Thankfully my idea has paid off and I would encourage others to think outside the box to get noticed by employers.' Will was contacted by more than 20 companies but chose to take the opportunity at VCCP. Michael Sugden, the company's CEO, told MailOnline: 'Here's a guy who has no job offers and instead of moping around, he created his own marketing campaign. 'I think that should be commended. I think it's great. I liked his initiative and creativity. People like that deserve a chance.' He added: 'So we've given him a month's trial and we'll take it from there.' In his video, Will talks about his time on BBC radio, meeting with the speaker of the House of Commons and passing his driving theory test first time - all in the style of David Brent. In the video, speaking using his hand to portray other people asking him questions, he said: 'Why am I not employed? Good question. Looking for a job: Will Bower made the hilarious video as a way to stand out from the crowd . The video features him answering a number of questions in which he explains his qualities and experiences . 'People say 'Oh, Will. Will, you're so successful already, aren't you?' 'Well yeah, cheers. '(They say) 'Will, you passed your driving theory test first time, right?' Yeah.' 'Why are you not employed then?' The truth is, I've been waiting. Playing it hard to get, as they say. 'Tip - let the companies come to you. Don't go to the job, don't go to the job. Naturally, gravitate, synergy.' Mr Bower added he has been 'loving life' and 'chillaxing' while he has been unemployed. He goes on to say: 'I've made this video for the people and the places that I want to work for. 'So if you're a marketing or a HR manager and you work at a marketing firm, then I'm interested. 'Send me over the thing, I'll sign it and I'll see you Monday. 'Work is a way of life for me - it's a religion. Christians, they pilgrimage to Lourdes, Muslims to Mecca, but me? To your desk. To my desk, in your building. 'I want to work for you. See you Monday, cheers.' Will's first video proved so popular, he was asked to create another to promote the QA Gateway Programme, a campaign to help graduates into tech roles.

Mrs Speight, from  Bredbury in Greater Manchester, had been Ringo's teenage sweetheart - with the  drummer telling her about his life in another band - Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. Another letter sent a year later just after Ringo - real name Richard Starkey - had joined the Beatles and mentions their debut single, Love Me Do.

'I . am doing very well with the new group, we have a record out I hope you . have herd (sic) it it is on (Radio) Luxemburg every night (also don't . forget to buy it).' Mrs Speight, now 69, had loaned the letters to her daughter Samantha over 20 years ago so she could show her university friends but thought they were lost. It was only when she started sorting out boxes of files in her garage when she realised she had a minor mouse problem that she found them again. She took them to auctioneers Bonhams in London who valued them at a few thousand pounds. They sold at auction for a hammer price of £13,000 pounds - but with all the fees added the price paid was £16,250. Mrs Speight said she is delighted with the result and plans to spend the money on a new bathroom. She said: 'I am very pleased and delighted with how much they sold for. It is much more than what I had been expecting. 'I . am going to have my bathroom done now and I will pay for my daughter's . holiday to Tenerife and a new dining table for my son.'

"The parents of virgin killer Elliot Rodger have said it is 'hell on earth' knowing that their son is responsible for so much heartbreak in their first formal statement. 'We are crying in pain for the victims and their families,' Peter and Chin Rodger said in a statement that was read by family friend Simon Astaire on Good Morning America on Thursday. 'It breaks our heart on a level that we didn't think possible. The feeling of knowing that it was our son's actions that caused the tragedy can only be described as hell on earth.' Astaire spoke about the Rodgers six days after their son stabbed three male students in his home - including two of his roommates - before gunning down two female students and another male. Scroll down for video . Statement: Simon Astaire, a family friend of Chin and Peter Rodger, read out a statement on their behalf on Good Morning America last week, saying that they are 'crying in pain' for the victims and their families . 'They have literally diminished in size,' Astaire, a long-time family friend and British author, said. 'They are crippled in pain. Every part of it is talking about [the other victims], not their son.' He explained that they were always worried that their troubled son would kill himself but after they received his 140-page manifesto - in which he detailed his plan for 'retribution' after girls failed to show any interest in him - last Friday, they realized that others might be in danger too. '[Chin] read the first four lines and she knew something was wrong,' Astaire said. She then clicked on his YouTube page and found terrifying videos in which he outlined his plan to 'slaughter' women. She called his father, Peter, from whom she is divorced. They realized they had to get to Santa Barbara as soon as possible and jumped in their cars. But during the drive, Chin heard about the massacre involving a black BMW - the one his mother had bought him - on the radio, Astaire said. Heartbroken: It is claimed Rodger's father Peter, pictured, is concerned about his son's use of anxiety drugs . Ripped apart: Peter Rodger is pictured left with . his daughter Georgia. Right, Georgia and her mother, Chin. The parents . are said to be more devastated about the six other victims than about . the death of their own son . The friend added that he had known Rodger most of his life but always thought he was an awkward child, who would shake whenever he was approached. 'I thought he was the loneliest person I've ever seen in my life,' he said. 'He fooled everyone for a very long time. He was a tragic figure. He is in many ways a monster.' Astaire's interview comes three days after he spoke to MailOnline and said that the parents were grieving more for the other victims than they were their own son. 'It is incredibly hard to be in their . company, because they are so distraught,' he said at the time. 'It is hard to be near them . because they are so devastated.' He also . insisted his friends had done everything they possibly could to avert . the massacre, from taking him to doctors to racing to the campus in a . bid to stop him. Killer: Elliot Rodger, pictured, stabbed three friends and gunned down three other students in California . Since the . shocking incident it has been revealed that police had contact with . Rodger three times while he was living in Isla Vista, but they failed to . see any warning signs. On one occasion, a family member called and asked officers to check on Rodger because they were worried about his mental state. In . his warped 141-page manifesto, he describes the incident, saying: 'If . they had demanded to search my room ... (t)hat would have ended . everything. For a few horrible seconds, I thought it was all over.... [T]he police would have searched my room, found all of my guns and . weapons, along with my writings about what I plan to do with them. 'I would have been thrown in jail, denied of the chance to exact revenge on my enemies. I can't imagine a hell darker than that.' Victims: Rodger's first victims included his roommates Weihan Wang, left, and Cheng Yuan Hong, right . Gunned down: George Chen, left, was also found . stabbed to death in their home - although he did not live at the house - . while Rodgers gunned down Chris Michael-Martinez, right, when he opened . fire at a deli . Loss: Katie Cooper, left, and Veronika Weiss . were standing outside a sorority house when they were shot . But . Rodger’s parents don't blame the authorities at all. Mr Astaire said: . 'They don't place any blame on the police, because Elliot fooled . everyone, no one knew the man he was turning into. 'He . seemed a sensitive guy, there was nothing aggressive about him, there . was no anger. No one recognizes the person portrayed in the manifesto. He didn’t act in that way, he was just in his own world. He didn’t once . speak about guns. 'If . you look at the amount of therapists they took him to, it is clear he . did all he could. He's writing with anger, but he constantly references . how they tried to make him feel better.'

"A group of university students are to have their lectures on criminology behind bars, alongside some of Britain’s most dangerous offenders. The scheme will see undergraduates from Durham University discuss drugs and the causes of crime with criminals at a high-security prison. Posters have been displayed around HMP Frankland and HMP Durham encouraging inmates to join the ten-week course, although sexual offenders will not be allowed to attend. Notable prisoners at category A prison HMP Frankland include Soham killer Ian Huntley (left) and Liberian warlord Charles Taylor (right), who is currently serving a 50-year sentence . Notable prisoners at category A prison HMP Frankland include Liberian warlord Charles Taylor, who is currently serving a 50-year sentence, and Soham killer Ian Huntley. Dr Kate O’Brien, who spent 18 months developing the programme, said: ‘It is about inviting prisoners to take time to reflect. It will be nothing like I’ve experienced or the students have experienced before.’ Students from Durham University will discuss crime and the effectiveness of the prison system over the ten-week course. Posters displayed around the prison invited inmates to apply for the course, with sexual offenders excluded. Candidates were then interviewed before undergoing a strict vetting procedure before being granted their place in the classroom. The course will see a dozen third year criminology students venturing into the prison for a weekly three-hour lecture where they will sit with the 12 selected male criminals. Posters have been displayed around HMP Frankland (above) and HMP Durham encouraging inmates to join the ten-week course, although sexual offenders will not be allowed to attend. The students involved have also undergone a rigorous inspection to ensure that they have no links to any of the offenders and have no criminal past. During the supervised discussions, the students will sit alternately in a circle while helped by a teaching assistant and two facilitators. While it is not yet know what offenders have been chosen to study the course, details of the course show that they will discuss drugs policy and the causes of crime. Students will also attend lectures with prisoners at HMP Durham, a category B prison. The contentious ‘Inside Out’ programme is the first of its kind to be launched in Europe, having first been trialled in an American prison in 1997. The course will see a dozen third year criminology students venturing into the prison for a weekly three-hour lecture where they will sit with the 12 selected male criminals . Academics travelled to Temple University in Philadelphia, where the programme was first developed, to learn how prisoners and students can both be incorporated into the classroom. The American programme has seen over 20,000 students venture into prisons to take part in classes. HMP Frankland has been blighted by problems including attacks on prison officers and high drug use among prisoners in recent times. Dr O’Brien said: ‘It is about inviting prisoners to take time to reflect on their own experiences and recognise their capacity to make changes. It is about the dialogue and interaction.’ Angie Petit, the deputy governor at Durham prison said: ’Durham prison is continuously looking for ways to help prisoners break the cycle of re-offending, whether through the work or education opportunities we provide.’","Scheme will see undergraduates from Durham University discuss drugs and the causes of crime with criminals .

"Shocking: 30-year-old mother of three Ashley Tull was arrested on drug charges after her daughter brought a pack-pack filled with 249 bags of heroin to her daycare . A 4-year-old Delaware girl brought a backpack filled with 249 baggies of heroin to her day care on Monday then passed it out to other children in the belief it was candy. The girl took a different bag than usual to Hickory Tree Child Care Center after a household pet ruined her bag the night before. Day care workers immediately contacted police and even rushed some of the kids to a hospital as a precaution, but no injuries were reported. According to WPVI, police were contacted just before noon Monday. They found the bag contained 3.735 grams of a white powdery substance. Police say the substance, which was still enclosed in the bags, was removed by the teachers and immediately taken to the Selbyville Police Department where it was determined to be heroin. It is not known how pure or how much heroin was in each of the 249 bags . Police believe the bag belonged to the girl's mother, 30-year-old Ashley Tull. Tull was charged with maintaining a drug property and endangering the welfare of a child. Along with her 4-year-old daughter, Tull's two other children--a 9-year-old boy and an 11-year-old girl were left in the custody of a family member. Tull was released on $6,000 bond. Police continue to investigate the incident and said more charges could be filed.

"MPs accused of expenses fraud will be protected by secrecy under rules unveiled last night. The expenses watchdog wants to withhold the names of those under investigation to save them from ‘reputational damage’. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, which has outraged voters with plans to raise MPs’ pay by 10 per cent, also wants to bar the public from hearings. Scroll down for video . MPs will not be named while they are under investigation for allegedly fiddling their expenses, under new plans . The authority claims that investigators will find interviews with MPs and their assistants ‘more instructive’ without public scrutiny. The proposals were condemned last night as foolish and perverse by the former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life. Sir Alistair Graham said the public had a right to know that their MP was under suspicion, especially after the parliamentary expenses scandal. Sir Alistair Graham, the former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said the public had a right to know that their MP was under suspicion, especially after the parliamentary expenses scandal . ‘To introduce measures which undermine transparency is foolish and perverse at a time when we are looking for increased transparency,’ he added. ‘This means that MPs will be able to string out the thing for as long as they like rather than everyone knowing there is an issue to be investigated. ‘This is a retrograde step when you consider that it was a lack of transparency which led to the expenses scandal in the first place.’ IPSA's former compliance officer Luke March, who had refused to release names of those being investigated on the basis it was ‘unfair’ John O’Connell, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Yet again, Ipsa has demonstrated itself to be thoroughly out of touch with the public. Transparency must be the watchword and if it insists on keeping probes secret it will undermine the whole point of setting up the organisation. ‘It must rethink these proposals or taxpayers will deem IPSA totally unfit for purpose.’ When the first IPSA rules were drawn up they indicated that the names of MPs under investigation should be released routinely when probes were launched. But initially, the body’s compliance officer, Luke March, refused to do so on the basis it was ‘unfair’ to those under scrutiny. He subsequently resigned and in 2011 the body concluded that identities should be made public during formal investigations – rather than afterward. That means constituents are able to look on the watchdog’s website to find whether their MP is accused of wrongdoing. But in the latest proposal, published yesterday, new compliance officer Peter Davis declares that the ‘public interest in transparency must be balanced with operational needs and fairness’. ‘On balance, we believe that the operational and reputational damage to MPs which could be caused by the publication of allegations in advance of a substantive investigation outweighs the benefits of release,’ the proposal states. ‘The compliance officer is likely to find discussions with MPs, staff and others more instructive and the evidence of a better quality when the discussions take place without the public scrutiny that accompanies press investigation. For this reason we plan now to amend the procedures so that the compliance officer is required to publicise the findings of all investigations as soon as practicable after its conclusion.’ Under the existing rules, the compliance officer is obliged to ‘take reasonable steps’ to allow members of the public to attend formal hearings into alleged wrongdoing by an MP. But the document states that no MP has asked for a hearing ‘because any MP is likely to judge that the benefits of the hearing would be outweighed by the possible publication of the details of the case’. A fortnight ago it emerged that MPs are pocketing even more in expenses than they did under the old rules. Last year they took £103million in allowances against £102million in 2008 . The proposals raise further question marks about the expenses regime set up after leaked documents in 2009 showed widespread fiddling by MPs. Only a fortnight ago it emerged that MPs are pocketing even more in expenses than they did under the old rules. Last year they took £103million in allowances against £102million in 2008.","MPs under investigation should not be named because it would be 'unfair'

'Abhorrent': Jewish fraternity Alpha Epsilon Pi at Emory University woke to find this graffiti on Sunday . Attack: The Atlanta school is investigating the vandalism, branding it an attack on the entire university . In a statement to students and others on campus, University President James Wagner said: 'Among the many pernicious things the swastika symbolizes, in the last century it represented the most egregious and determined undermining of intellectual freedom and truth-seeking. 'In short, its appearance on our campus is an attack against everything for which Emory stands.' Yom Kippur, or the day of atonement, is the holiest day of the year in the Jewish calendar and is observed by many secular Jews who may not observe other religious holidays. Traditionally, it involves 25 hours of fasting and intensive prayer plus a number of synagogue services. Campus officials were meeting with student leaders to provide support and determine next steps, the statement said.

The Prince of Wales paid a heartfelt tribute to his mother last night, following the Diamond Jubilee concert staged near Buckingham Palace. Stood on stage with the Queen a few feet away, Charles told hundreds of thousands who had gathered to watch the star-studded event that they were 'celebrating the life and service of a very special person'. But he added there was a disappointing element to the night. Build up on the Mall, ahead of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Procession . 'The only sad thing about this evening is that my father cannot be her with us because unfortunately he's taken unwell,"" he said.The Prince went on to say: 'And we're now celebrating the life and service of a very special person, over the last 60 years. I was three when my grandfather George VI died and suddenly, unexpectedly you and my father's lives were irrevocably changed when you were only 26. 'So as a nation this is our opportunity to thank you and my father for always being there for us. For inspiring us with your selfless duty and service and for making us proud to be British.' Celebrities attending the concert included Brian May, who famously played the national anthem on the palace's roof during the 2002 Golden Jubilee concert, television presenters Floella Benjamin and Kirstie Allsopp, and ex-Bond Girl Barbara Bach who is married to former Beatle Ringo Starr. Many of the hosts, who included Lenny Henry and Jimmy Carr, poked fun at the royals. But Rob Brydon got one of the biggest laughs from the crowds when he said: 'Sixty years of reign. Sounds like a Welsh summer.' Kylie Minogue arrived on stage dressed as a Pearly Queen, wearing a romper-style black shorts suit adorned with mother of pearl buttons. She completed the look with a black jacket that had a crown design in buttons on the back, and a peak cap. Sir Elton John's Crocodile Rock was one of the biggest tunes of the night, with William, Harry and Beatrice singing and dancing in their seats to the 70s tune. The palace was transformed into a row of terraced houses, via a projection, for Madness' performance from the historic building's roof. Lead singer Suggs ended the tune Our House by changing one of the lines of the lyric and saying in a posh accent, 'In the middle of one's street'.The royals stood for the final act, Sir Paul McCartney, who ran through a string of Beatles songs including Magical Mystery Tour, All My Loving and Let It Be. After Charles' speech there was a huge fireworks display fired from the roof of the palace.","Accompanied by father Prince Andrew to join 2,000 invitees .

"Elizabeth Murdoch spotted jogging  without her wedding ring . Rupert Murdoch’s daughter Elisabeth was seen without her wedding ring yesterday as it emerged she is to divorce PR guru Matthew Freud after 13 years. The TV boss showed a brave face as she stepped out to go jogging with her dog. The couple – worth £260million between them – are divorcing amid rumours of a long-standing conflict between Mr Freud and his father-in-law, worsened by a row over Tony Blair’s friendship with the media tycoon’s ex-wife. Mr Freud, 50, and Miss Murdoch, 46, who have two children aged 13 and seven, are expected to be granted a decree nisi this week. Sources said one factor in the breakdown of their marriage was the antagonism between the PR chief and Mr Murdoch. Mr Freud took the side of his old friend Mr Blair when his 83-year-old father-in-law filed for divorce from Wendi Deng, 45, last year after becoming angered by claims the former prime minister met his wife several times without his knowledge. Friends of Mr Blair have always insisted his relationship with Miss Deng is entirely platonic. Relations between Mr Freud and Mr Murdoch then soured further, culminating in him banning his father-in-law from attending his 50th birthday party at his £8million Oxfordshire mansion, Burford Priory, last November. Mr Freud said last December: ‘I will be eternally grateful to Rupert Murdoch for producing Elisabeth, who is practically perfect in every way. ‘Our views differ quite dramatically on a number of subjects professionally and I regret that this has caused my relationship with him to be sometimes conflicted. Scroll down for video . Rift (left to right): Rupert Murdoch and his daughter Elisabeth, Wendi Deng and Matthew Freud . ‘But we have had good times as well as bad times, we both love his daughter and his grandchildren, if not always each other. I do not believe anything else is terribly important.’ A family friend told the Mail on Sunday: ‘Matthew and Elisabeth were deeply in love but no couple could survive the emotional pressures they have been under in recent years.’ The couple are expected to split their £260million fortune equally. Miss Murdoch personally made £130million in 2011 when she sold her TV production company Shine, whose hit programmes include MasterChef, to her father’s company News Corporation. Freud and Murdoch were married 13 years . Her husband, who is the great-grandson of psychoanalysis pioneer Sigmund Freud, founded PR company Freud Communications and is worth an estimated £100million. They met in 1997, when they were both married to other people, and were immediately attracted to each other. Having left their spouses, Miss Murdoch and Mr Freud had their first child, Charlotte, in November 2000. They briefly separated before marrying at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire in 2001. Their second child, Samson, was born in January 2007. The couple’s parties were legendary for their heady mix of celebrities, senior politicians, media stars and colourful entrepreneurs. Their combined wealth was estimated at £260million in the latest Sunday Times Rich List, which ranked them as one of the top 25 wealthiest couples in the UK. The couple have made no public comment about their separation. But Mr Freud’s sister, radio presenter Emma Freud, retweeted a message from former Sun editor David Yelland: ‘Very sorry to read about the Matthew Freud-Elisabeth Murdoch split, but what I do know is they’re both great parents.’ A source close to Rupert Murdoch said yesterday that his daughter had her father’s full love and support but did not comment further.","Elisabeth Murdoch seen out jogging with her dog without her ring .

"The violence sweeping the streets of Belfast is so serious that police reinforcements may be drafted in from mainland Britain. Officers have been attacked by rioters for five nights in protest at Belfast council’s decision to limit the number of days the Union Flag is flown above city hall to 18. Previously it was displayed every day. Police have been shot at and bombarded with a hail of missiles – including petrol bombs, fireworks and bricks. By yesterday, 62 officers had been injured and around 100 people arrested since the protests began in early December. Fires: Loyalists set up burning barricades on the Newtownards Road in Belfast, a month after the City Council decided to fly the Union Flag on designated days only . Most demonstrations have been peaceful, but it has been claimed that senior members of the paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force are orchestrating the street violence by loyalists in East Belfast. City Hall was picketed by hundreds of loyalists last night when the council met for the first time since its decision over flag days was made. Ulster’s top policeman, Matt Baggott, has told Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers he will need ‘more resources’ if the disorder continues, MailOnline understands. And intelligence sources have revealed that members of the Army’s Special Reconnaissance Regiment – a secretive unit established during the Troubles to run surveillance against republican and loyalist paramilitary groups – have been deployed to the area. Mr Baggott insisted he did not need extra officers at present, but that maintaining a large police presence to deal with the violence would undermine his ability to tackle the terror threat from dissident republicanism. March: Loyalist Flag protestors converge on Belfast City Hall, a month after the city council's controversial decision . ‘It will eat into our ability to deal with what remains a very severe dissident threat, and their intent remains as strong as ever,’ he said. If Mr Baggott requests help, he would have to inform the Association of Chief Police Officers, which would co-ordinate the deployment of officers from England and Wales. The first designated flag day will be tomorrow, to celebrate the Duchess of Cambridge’s 31st birthday. Last night the disorder erupted as around 250 demonstrators from East Belfast returned from the city centre past a volatile community interface at the republican Short Strand. Police said a number of missiles were thrown at the protesters from the Short Strand area, where around 70 youths had gathered. Tense: Loyalist protesters confront riot police at Belfast City Hall as violent protests flared in Northern Ireland . Unhappy: Loyalists confront police in Belfast, a month after the City Council decided to fly the Union Flag on designated days only . The trouble soon spiralled from there as police moved up the adjacent Newtownards Road to separate rival factions. Officers were attacked with petrol bombs, paint bombs, fireworks and heavy masonry while rioters damaged vehicles with hatchets and sledge hammers. Protesters constructed a barricade in the middle of the road and set it on fire. Police also received reports of an attempted car hi-jacking in the nearby Templemore Avenue area and attempted lorry hi-jacking in the Albertbridge Road area. Police deployed water cannon and five baton rounds were fired. Calm was restored around 10pm. Last night two males and two females were arrested in East Belfast for riot and public order offences.","Officers have been attacked by rioters in Northern Ireland for five nights .

"Jaield: Sabrina Zunich, 19, who pleaded guilty last month to aggravated murder in the stabbing death of 41-year-old Lisa Knoefel, was sentenced Monday,  to life in prison with a chance for parole in 30 years. An Ohio teenager who killed her foster mother in 2012 after her foster father's told her to do it, has been sentenced to life in prison with a chance for parole in 30 years. Nineteen-year-old Sabrina Zunich pleaded guilty last month to aggravated murder in the stabbing death of 41-year-old Lisa Knoefel  in their home in the Cleveland suburbs. Zunich testified at the trial of Kevin Knoefel that he'd threatened suicide if his wife wasn't killed. Zunich and the now 44-year-old Kevin Knoefel were romantically involved. Kevin Knoefel received the same sentence as Zunich after a jury found him guilty of conspiracy to commit aggravated murder and sexual battery. He was accused of having a sexual relationship with his foster daughter and showing her how to stab his wife. Prosecutors say Knoefel wanted his wife dead to collect $750,000 in life insurance. At Monday's sentencing, Judge RIchard Collins made his thoughts clear. 'I don't think there was any question she was manipulated and used by the co-defendant,' Collins said. But he said the seriousness of the crime outweighed all factors. 'Aggravated murder is aggravated murder,' Collins said. 'But this was not a single violent act.' He said Lisa Knoefel suffered before she died. 'She was screaming for help and begging the defendant to stop. She did not die immediately. I cannot imagine the nature of terror and fear.' Tearful: Zunich sobbed as she faced a during one of her hearings . Prosecutors told jurors that Kevin Knoefel wanted his wife out of the picture but was afraid he'd lose custody of their three-year-old daughter if they divorced. During the trial, Zunich said she had fallen in love with her foster father and feared he would commit suicide if she didn't carry out their plot to kill his wife. She said it was he who devised the plan to murder his wife. Kevin Knoefel (left) was convicted in June of conspiring to kill his wife Lisa (right) She said they were carrying on a sexual relationship and discussed several plans to kill Lisa Knoefel, including shooting her and making it look like a burglary, or finding a hit man. Zunich testified that she put on a ski mask and fatally stabbed 41-year-old Lisa Knoefel in her bed as she fought back in November 2012, when she was 17. Prosecutors said Zunich stabbed and cut her more than 150 times with a 10-inch serrated knife. She was not deterred even though Knoefel fought and pleaded for her to stop and the woman's teenage daughter tried to pull Zunich off her mother and called 911. Prosecutors have said they were unaware of Zunich's sexual relationship with Kevin Knoefel or that he had persuaded her to kill Lisa Knoefel until Zunich spoke with them in May, 2013. Jailed: Sabrina Zunich, 18, was found covered in blood with a knife still in her hand after the brutal murder of her foster mother. She will now spend the next 30 years in jail . The case against Kevin Knoefel for the most part rested on the testimony of Zunich, whose graphically detailed her relationship with Knoefel and what led her to kill Lisa Knoefel. She testified in court that Knoefel told her he didn't love his wife anymore and didn't want a divorce because he didn't want to share custody of Hailey, their 3-year-old daughter. He told her they could raise Hailey together. On November 15, 2012, he cried and told her he had a big fight with his wife and was going to kill himself if she was not dead. With his encouragement, she decided to kill Lisa Knoefel. Zunich said Monday at sentencing that she was remorseful. 'I want to say how sorry I am for all those I hurt,' she said. 'Lisa did not deserve what happened to her. I ask forgiveness be given to me - not for my benefit but for those who need the healing process to begin. I can't explain how much remorse I have and how much sadness I deal with.'","Sabrina Zunich was arrested following the murder of Lisa Knoefel in 2012 .

"Cardiff defender Juan Cala has left the Sky Bet Championship club following an apology to club owner Vincent Tan. Cala's departure comes just a week after he criticised Cardiff for being sent to train at the club's academy, although Bluebirds manager Russell Slade said ahead of last weekend's 1-0 league win at Watford that the centre-back 'is doing his rehab work there'. 'Cardiff City Football Club can confirm that on Wednesday, 3rd December 2014, Juan Cala's contract with the club was terminated by mutual agreement,' said a club statement. Juan Cala has left Championship side Cardiff after his contract was terminated by mutual agreement . The former Sevilla man was signed by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer but has struggled to make the team this season . 'The player leaves Cardiff City with immediate effect. 'We would like to thank Juan for his contribution and wish him the very best for his future.' Cala had earlier apologised to Tan on Twitter for his academy comments last week. 'I wish to apologise to Tan Sri Vincent Tan for my recent comments. He had nothing to do with my move to the academy,' Cala wrote on Twitter. The 25-year-old Spanish centre-back, who was signed by former Cardiff manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer from Sevilla in January, has made only one Championship appearance this season having slipped down the pecking order below Bruno Ecuele Manga, Ben Turner, Sean Morrison and Danny Gabbidon. Slade had said on Friday that Cardiff would investigate whether Cala had broken club discipline rules on social media and would look to move the player on during the January transfer window. Cala made 11 appearances for Cardiff and scored two goals, both coming in the Barclays Premier League last season at Everton and Southampton.","Spanish defender Juan Cala has left Championship side Cardiff City .

"Isabel Ramsay, executive headteacher of Bandon Hill Primary School is paid more than the Prime Minister . A primary school head teacher is being paid more than £200,000 a year - taking her income above that of the Prime Minister. Isabel Ramsay is paid more than her boss, the chief executive of Sutton Council and is one of the highest paid headteachers in Britain. Her school, Bandon Hill Primary, said she is paid so much because she is executive head teacher and does work throughout London with other schools. But union workers have said they do not believe Mrs Ramsay should be paid so much more than other teachers and she should be focusing on her school rather than working at others. Mrs Ramsay's income was revealed after Sutton council published its core financial statement this year. This revealed she is paid £190,898 in salary, fees and allowances with a further £14,178 in employer's pension contribution, bringing the total to £205,076. The Prime Minister is paid £142,500 and Mrs Ramsey's boss, Niall Bolger received a basic salary of £163,635, with a pension top up of £28,473 bringing his total to £192.108. Mrs Ramsey's salary is determined by the governors at the school, not Sutton Council or the Department of Education. When Sutton Council asked the school to explain Mrs Ramsey's high income they said it covered her work at Bandon Hill as well as that supporting other schools across the country. Bandon Hill Primary School, in Wallington, south west London, is made up of two primary schools and Oak Field, a specialist autistic unit. Each of the three schools have their own headteacher. Nancy Bonney, 82, is the assistant secretary for NUT Sutton. She said: 'Every teacher I have ever met works extremely hard and their best for the children. 'I don't think a head teacher should work at more than one school. Even if you have the best deputy, it is not the same. Governors at Bandon Hill said Mrs Ramsay's salary is due to the work she does with schools across the UK . Mrs Ramsay's pay was revealed in Sutton Council's core financial statements, showing that with her salary and employer pension contributions she earns more than the chief executive of Sutton Council, her boss. 'She must be run off her feet even if she is very well organised. 'I don't know about head teachers being paid so much more than their staff and I don't think one head should be running more than one school.' Mrs Ramsay's salary increased from £172,218 last year, making her one of the highest paid headteachers in the country. A spokesman for the school governors said her pay reflected the fact she was running a 'very large primary school'. He added: 'In addition the Executive Headteacher and other staff from Bandon Hill are currently supporting three other schools, one of which is in London, one in the South East and one in the East of England. As a national leader of education, and as a national support school, the Executive Headteacher and the staff provide a range of interventions, including working directly with other headteachers, to support those schools in accelerating pupil progress and in raising standards of attainment. Mrs Ramsay is one of the highest paid headteachers . In 2010 it was revealed that Mark Elms, 57, of Tidemill Primary School in Lewisham, south-east London, received £248,100. His salary which was due in part to his work on the London Challenge programme, was described as 'extraordinary' and 'exorbitant'at the time. And in May of this year Sir Greg Martin, executive head of Durand Academy in south London, saw his salary and pension increase to a total of £229,138. He was knighted in last year's birthday honours. Ric Adams, chairman of Bandon Hill Primary School's governors, said: 'The salary level of all staff in Bandon Hill, including the executive head teacher, is determined by the school's governing body. 'The salary figure currently being attributed to the executive head teacher is not an accurate reflection of the actual salary paid by Bandon Hill Primary School. 'Bandon Hill is a designated national support school and the executive head teacher is a national leader of education. 'Therefore the remuneration level quoted includes both pension contributions as per requirements and also reflects the work which the executive head teacher and the school do in supporting a number of other schools in several local authorities across the country.' A spokesman for Sutton Council said neither they or the Department of Education had been approached by the school's governors about Mrs Ramsey's level of remuneration.. He said: 'The level of pay for school staff is decided by school's governors and not the responsibility of the council. 'We are aware of the salary figure for the head teacher which is much higher than usual. In 2010 it was revealed that Tidemill Primary School headteacher Mark Elms (left) was earning a salary of £248,100 and earlier this year that Sir Greg Martin (right) was receiving an income of £229,138 . 'We asked the governing body to explain the package and have been told it covers school salary plus remuneration for work done at schools in other local authorities.' Mrs Ramsay has been at the school for more than 20 years according to her LinkedIn profile. In its last Ofsted inspection in 2008 the then Bandon Hill Primary School achieved an outstanding rating.","Isabel Ramsay is executive headteacher at Bandon Hill Primary School .

"Residents of Morayfield in Queensland are baffled that their neighbourhood has been ranked as the second most liveable suburb in Australia. In a new study, mortgage broker Aussie Home Loans has researched the median house price, block size, capital gain and distance to amenities for 3800 localities. According to the results, the Queensland town of Morayfield, 50km north of Brisbane, is the second  most liveable destination in Australia. Morayfield in north-east Australia was ranked second most liveable city in Australia, however locals were sceptical of the study on social media . On the Caboolture Herald's Facebook page, the responses to the ranking were largely sceptical. R Cameron Fowler said: 'Whoever voted obviously didn't visit Morayfield.' Mary Spencer said the ranking was the:  'Best joke I have heard so far this year' Lisa Louise said that while people were being overly harsh, the ranking was inaccurate. 'It's not as bad as people think, but 2nd in the country?!? Definately not!!!' Others posts on the page were more supportive. Mrs Curran said considering the facilities it had, Morayfield was perfect. 'I don't need anything else. We're close to shops, the kids' schools, they're close to sporting facilities. We know the neighbours and they're all friendly' she said. 'I think if you are searching for the stuff you need it's probably in the area.' Dallas McCoist, (left) said she was 'proud that Morayfield has absolutely anything you could want,' while Lisa Louise (right) said it's 'definitely not' the second most liveable city in Australia . Roger Meredith has lived in the area for 28 years and said he liked the 'country atmosphere while still being close to the city'. 'We're five minutes from train stations, schools and the shopping centre. It's close to both coasts, Brisbane and Bribie.' 'We've got a quiet sort of street but and there's a school bus that goes through the area too. I think it's what you make of it,' he said. Dallas McCoist, an 11 year resident, said: 'I'm proud of Morayfield and the fact that it has absolutely anything you could want. Maybe if more people took pride in the suburb they lived in maybe it would be a better environment for all.' The study comes after after an Economist study that revealed Australia is now the most overpriced housing market in the world, when measured against incomes and rents of 23 major economies. The inflation is due to a demand for Australian properties that now exceeded the supply.","New study from Aussie Home Loans ranks the most liveable suburbs in Australia .

"One of the most historic active studios in country music history will be torn down to build luxury apartments unless somebody comes to its rescue by end of play today. RCA Studio A in the heart of Nashville, Tennessee, has been visited by a host of country stars including Willie Nelson, Elvis Presley, the Beach Boys and Dolly Parton. But unless a solution is found in the eleventh hour it seems that the recording studio will become the latest victim of the gentrification transforming the city. RCA Studio A in the heart of Nashville, Tennessee, has been visited by a host of country stars including Willie Nelson, Elvis Presley, the Beach Boys and Dolly Parton . To many in the music industry, RCA Studio A has become a symbol of 'old Nashville' and the city's rich musical legacy. The studios were constructed in 1965 at the request of Chet Atkins, who was originally looking for a place to track string parts for Elvis Presley's gospel albums. Current tenant Ben Folds, who has been who has been recording artists in the studio since 2003, has been campaigning to save the space for several months after learning it would be sold to new ownership. 'I've recorded all over the world and I can say emphatically that ￼there's no recording space like it anywhere on the planet,' Mr Folds wrote in an impassioned open letter. 'These studio walls were born to ring with ￼music.' To many in the music industry, RCA Studio A is a symbol of 'old Nashville' and the city's rich musical legacy . A doll modeled after recording artist Ben Folds sits on one of his pianos in RCA Studio A. Current tenant Mr Folds has been campaigning to save the space for several months . He added: 'I had no idea of the extent of legacy of this great studio until I become the tenant of the space 12 years ago. 'I can't tell you how many engineers, producers and musicians have walked into this space to share their stories of the great classic recorded music made here that put Nashville on the map. 'I've heard tales of audio engineers who would roller skate around the room waiting for Elvis to show up at some point in the weeks he booked, stories about how Eddy Arnold recording one of the first sessions in the room and one of the songs was Make The World Go Away, Dolly Parton (Jolene) and The Monkees recorded here, and so on.' Mr Folds fought an energetic campaign to save the studios and drew a crowd of about 200 during a Music Row rally a few months ago. But he revealed last month that his landlord Bravo Development had more than doubled the rent, leaving him no choice but to bow out. The famous recording studios are nondescript from the outside but they have have hosted some of the greatest country musicians of all time . However, not everybody in the creative industry is opposed to closing the doors of the recording studio. In an open letter, acclaimed country guitar player Harold Bradley - a former owner of RCA Studio A - rebuked anyone willing to stand in the way of progress. 'What makes a place historic?' he asked. 'The architecture of the Nashville sound was never brick and mortar. Certainly, there are old studio spaces that, in our imaginations, ring with sonic magic; but in truth, it's not the room, it's the music.' 'Music city isn't about a perfect room, or hanging just the right baffling,' he added. 'Turns out, the architecture of Nashville's evolving sound is a synergy of creative energy. That's still here, and it has nothing to do with this building.' Dolly Parton recorded Jolene in the cavernous recording studios in the heart of Nashville, Tennessee . But other in the music industry argue that RCA Studio A has since grown into a landmark and stands as a metaphor for the music that built Nashville into a thriving city. Along Nashville's famous Music Row, commercial development is pushing out the eclectic mix of recording studios, record label buildings, publishing houses and music industry office space. At least two studios have been torn down in the last year, and the district is shrinking. 'There's a squeeze going on,' said Mike Kopp, president of the Music Industry Coalition, which includes hundreds of music executives, songwriters, musicians and fans. 'It's been squeezed down to about three or four streets ... and that continues to get squeezed.' The studios were constructed in 1965 at the request of Chet Atkins, who was originally looking for a place to track string parts for Elvis Presley's gospel albums .","RCA Studio A looks set to be torn down to build luxury apartments .

"A couple who spent £20,000 on fertility treatment finally conceived thanks to a controversial treatment involving egg yolk and soya. Cathy Garvey and her partner Dan Bowley spent six years trying for a baby. Four rounds of IVF treatment failed, leaving the couple, from Birmingham, heartbroken. But they finally achieved success after trying a new technique being pioneered in Britain. Cathy Garvey and her partner Dan Bowley spent six years trying for a baby. After four unsuccessful rounds of IVF and £20,000 they eventually succeeded thanks to a pioneering treatment involving egg yolk and soya . Called intravenous intralipid therapy, it is made from soya bean oil, egg yolk, glycerin and water and administered through an IV drip. It works on the premise that some women are actually immune to pregnancy. So, when an embryo tries to develop in their womb, their immune system goes into overdrive to destroy it as if it were an intruding bug or virus. Instead, the IV mixture helps by fighting killer cells that destroy a mother's chance of pregnancy. And thanks to the unusual treatment, Ms Garvey and Mr Bowley are now proud parents to baby Joseph who was born on July 8, weighing 7lbs 14oz. Their son's arrival means they can now begin saving for their wedding. 'It was worth every penny because we got Joseph in the end,' said Ms Garvey, 43, a recruitment administrator. 'We did have to put off our wedding because we couldn't afford it after spending so much money on fertility treatment. 'But Joseph is perfect. He'll be the guest of honour at our wedding.' The intralipid treatment, as it is known,  enabled Ms Garvey to conceive baby Joseph, born in July this year . Ms Garvey had expected to have problems conceiving after previously being told she had blocked fallopian tubes. But with no success after two years of trying, she and Mr Bowley, a retail manager, received two courses of IVF on the NHS, both of which failed. Further heartbreak followed after Ms Garvey conceived after the third cycle - but went on to miscarry at five weeks. Desperate to become parents, the couple visited a fertility clinic in January last year. Called intravenous intralipid therapy, it is made from soya bean oil, egg yolk, glycerin and water and administered through an IV drip. It works on the premise that some women are actually immune to pregnancy. So, when an embryo tries to develop in their womb, their immune system goes into overdrive to destroy it as if it were an intruding bug or virus. Instead, the IV mixture helps by fighting natural killer cells that destroy a mother's chance of pregnancy. The IV mixture is highly calorific — about 200 calories a dose, the equivalent of a Snickers bar — and has been likened to 'getting an armful of mayonnaise' Administered via a drip usually twice before conception, and then three more times after, the treatment is thought to help the embryo implant and grow normally. Alongside this, women are also recommended to take steroids, which further suppress the immune system, and blood thinners to prevent blood clots, which also can impede embryos implanting. There, medical experts discovered Ms Garvey had natural killer cells, which were attacking any embryos placed inside her. 'The cells were rejecting the embryos every time we tried IVF,' she said. 'It was heartbreaking for us when we couldn't get pregnant.. We really wanted a baby and that's why we went through extremes of having IVF.' Finally in November last year, they started the process again at the CARE fertility centre. But this time, doctors decided to combat the natural killer cells by giving Ms Garvey two intralipid infusions of egg yolk and soya oil. The therapy stimulates the immune system to suppress so-called 'natural killer cells' and allow an embryo to implant in the womb. One was administered when the fertilised embryos were put back inside her, another when she had a positive pregnancy test. She said: 'This was the last time we were going to have IVF and I just had a very positive feeling about it from the beginning. 'We kept our fingers crossed and two weeks later we had a positive test. 'When we went for the early scan to check everything was OK, we were petrified -  but also over the moon. 'We saw the picture and Dan asked what the flashing was on the screen, and we were told it was the heart beat. 'We both just burst into tears. We hadn't even got that far with the other pregnancy. 'While I was pregnant with Joseph I never moaned about anything. And it was amazing when I felt him kicking inside me. Having a baby was our priority. We've now started saving for our wedding.'","Cathy Garvey and her partner Dan Bowley spent six years trying for a baby .

"On Jordyn Miller's first day of primary school, the six-year-old cancer survivor refused to take off her hat. After five months of chemotherapy and a long recovery from surgery, the kindergarten student from Wingham on the north coast of New South Wales, was most concerned about her missing long hair. 'She used to have beautiful, long curly hair that she used to love – she's a very girly girl and the chemo caused it to fall out which was a big deal for Jordyn,' Her mother Tarin Miller,33, told Daily Mail Australia. Jordyn Miller (left) was diagnosed with stage one cancer when she was five. She and her sister Charli (right) would wear tights and tea-towels on their heads to help Jordyn cope with losing her beloved hair . On her first day of school, the six-year-old refused to remove her hat and was bullied for 'looking like a boy' 'When she first started school, she was shy about it and kids being kids used to tease her about looking like a boy. They'd call her ugly.' One of her daughter's coping mechanisms was to wear a pair of tights or a tea-towel on her head. 'One day Jordan just come out of her room with the tights on her head and said ""this is my beautiful long hair"" and Charli, being her little sister, just copied,' she said. The sibling would spend entire days with tea towels or tights on their heads, even enlisting their cousin whenever she would visit. When she was five year's old, a urine infection led to the discovery of a tumour in Jordyn's left kidney. She was quickly diagnosed with stage one cancer and was signed up for surgery to remove the organ. The kindergarten student had her left kidney removed after she was found to have a Wilms tumour . Jordyn, pictured with her parents Tarin and Anthony (left), also underwent five months of chemotherapy in which she lost all her hair . According to Gary Nunn from the cancer charity Camp Quality, Jordyn is one of 10,000 children across Australia who are currently newly diagnosed, under treatment or in remission from cancer treatment. Mr Nunn told Daily Mail Australia that after all the emotional and physical hardships endured by the children throughout their treatment, just as things are starting to look up, one of the most common problems they encounter is bullying. 'We've heard about everything from pointing and staring and: 'mummy, why does she looks so different?' to exclusion and isolation,' Mr Nunn said. 'Exclusion is one of the more common ones, kids are often left out because other kids think that they can catch cancer and it's contagious. Camp Quality has been performing a puppet show in schools across the country to encourage students to support  their peers who are suffering or recovering from cancer . 'We hear it a lot and there was one incident of name calling recently where we had a mum ringing us up and saying her daughter was being called 'baldie' and some of the kids were taking off her beanie and throwing it and playing catch with it'. Camp Quality is determined to change this mentality and teach children that there is no need to cover up the effects of their cancer treatment, while educating their peers about how to be supportive and understanding of kids living with cancer. The charity has been roaming the country with their educational puppet show on the request of parents and teachers, to expel the myths around cancer. Gary Nunn, a spokesperson for the cancer charity, said that by the end of the show ,the kids are all cheering for the bald puppet character to take off her hat . The show discourages bullying and expels myths that children hold about cancer, including that it is contagious, encouraging them to support and include kids with . Their show, which has been view by over 230,000 children in the last year and relies on public support to continue running, involves a bald cancer-patient puppet who tries to decide if she should take off her hat. 'By the end of the show the kids are all cheering for her to take off her hat,' Mr Nunn explains. 'Once our puppet show had come to one school, we heard of a girl who went back to her class and quietly removed her hat and she didn't wear it from then on. Once we teach the students about it, that child becomes a sort of hero for all they've been through and they have other children falling over themselves to be their friend.' After Mrs Miller asked Camp Quality to come to her daughter's school to perform their puppet show, she said there was an instant change in attitude. Now, whilst her hair is still much shorter than it once was, Jordyn - who is now in remission - often tells her mother how much she's looking forward to having long hair again.","Jordyn Miller was diagnosed with stage one cancer at five-years-old .

"David Cameron entertained supermodel Claudia Schiffer at his official country retreat, official record revealed this morning. The Prime Minister dined with the pin-up and her English film producer husband, Matthew Vaughn, at a Chequers gathering. The glamorous pair attended as guests of US ambassador Matthew Barzun, according to an illustrious list of names entertained at Chequers between January and March which was released this morning. Matthew Vaughn (left), pictured with his supermodel wife Claudia Schiffer and David Cameron in 2008, is a long-term supporter of the Prime Minister . Samantha Cameron and Claudia Schiffer dined together at the British Fashion Awards dinner at The Savoy in 2010 . Mr Cameron also held a lunch with Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh in February, the first such royal visit to the grace-and-favour Buckinghamshire mansion for more than four decades. Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte paid a visit as the PM continued efforts to secure allies in his EU reform effort. Marks & Spencer boss Marc Bolland, ex-MI5 chief Baroness Manningham-Buller and the head of the UK's armed forces General Sir Nicholas Houghton and the other service chiefs were also guests. The Prime Minister was sufficiently impressed by a watch gifted to him by Interpol to pay £150 to keep it, while a pair of shoes given by designer outfit Oliver Sweeney cost him £279. Wine presented by the prime minister of Moldova was served to official guests and a trinket box and coat from outgoing Afghan president Hamid Karzai was retained by Number 10 as it was worth more than the allowed limit.

"Succulent lobster, whether served with cream and brandy as a lavish thermidor or simply with butter, is the ultimate luxury dish, writes ALDO ZILLI. Yet this gourmet treat is suddenly cheap as chips - with supermarkets competing to sell it for the lowest price. Budget chain Lidl is offering entire frozen lobsters for £5.99 each, while Iceland - which has started stocking the delicacy for the first time this week - is selling them at just £5. Scroll down for video . Lobster is suddenly becoming cheaper - with supermarkets competing to sell it for the lowest price, writes Aldo Zilli (pictured) The retailers are able to do this because the wholesale price of lobster has plunged by an astonishing 70 per cent in recent years, according to the Wall Street Journal. So why the sudden drop? The reason appears to lie with climate change. As the sea temperatures rise, lobsters are hatching earlier and they are growing faster. Also, the over-fishing of cod in the Atlantic means that fewer of these predatory fish are gobbling up baby lobsters. The result is that this ocean is now teeming with the tasty crustaceans. And it is these lobsters from American and Canadian waters that are now being sold at rock-bottom prices in British stores. By contrast, lobsters from Scottish waters still have a pricier tag: one from the Orkney Islands, for example, is likely to set you back upwards of £20. But are the cut-price varieties reduced in taste, too? Here, I test a range of supermarket lobsters and lobster tails and give my verdict, as a chef and seafood expert. All of the lobsters come from the freezer aisles, and while some are pre-cooked and others raw, I’ve prepared them in the same way: by sautéing in a little butter. As sea temperatures rise, lobsters are hatching earlier and they are growing faster . ICELAND . Luxury Canadian Whole Cooked Lobster, 350g, £5. The lovely, coral-red shell makes for a fantastic centrepiece. But looks are deceptive. The tail meat is mushy when it should be firm. I suspect the lobster was left out of the water too long before it was killed. Lobster meat deteriorates rapidly. The claw meat is usually my favourite because it’s even sweeter and more tender than the tail, but this contains just a few strings of flesh reminiscent of tinned salmon. Yuck. This lobster is not tasty enough as a stand-alone dish. But at a bargain price of £5 it’s definitely not a disaster: I would happily use it for my favourite lobster spaghetti recipe. Remove all the meat from the lobster and chop up the tail meat, but leave the claw intact. Fry a small red onion and a sliced garlic clove in olive oil. After two minutes pour over 50ml of brandy, and flambé. Once the flames die down, add two chopped beef tomatoes, four tablespoons of chopped parsley, four chopped basil leaves and another garlic clove. Pop in the lobster meat and 150ml of dry white wine. Simmer for 5-8 minutes until the juices reduce slightly. Serve with 175g of cooked spaghetti. That’s enough for two people. Bellissimo! 3/5 . LIDL . Deluxe Whole Cooked Lobster, 350g, £5.99. Fantastic. This lobster is crammed with meat and it’s deliciously sweet. The shell cracks well when I bend it with my fingers and the flesh comes away easily from the tail, which shows it’s really fresh. If the lobster’s out of the water for too long before it’s killed, the flesh shrinks away. Budget chain Lidl is offering its frozen 'Deluxe Whole Cooked Lobster' for just £5.99 each . The claws are full of delicious, tender flesh. It’s so good, you don’t need to do a thing to it. It reminds me of a lovely lobster supper I recently enjoyed in Italy under the stars. I just poured myself a glass of Prosecco and got stuck in. I’m impressed. 5/5 . WAITROSE . Big & Juicy Whole Cooked Canadian lobster, 425g, £9.99. This is the biggest lobster by far, so I was expecting a feast. But what a letdown. The claws are virtually empty — I have to dig around to get even a sliver of meat. And the meat in the tail is unpleasantly chewy. It’s like gnawing on a skipping rope. Sadly the best thing to do with this lobster is use it for stock. Put the head and shell into a pan, cover with water, add a tablespoonful of brandy, splash of tomato puree and handful of dried herbs then cook very gently for two hours. But what a waste when for the same money you can buy two juicy lobster tails (see Aldi below). 1/5 . TESCO . Cuisine & Ocean Whole Blanched Lobster, 350g, £8. THIS is so mushy, it’s like chewing a wodge of cotton wool — and just as flavourless. The packaging says the lobster has been blanched for 1-2 minutes ‘just long enough for the meat to separate from the shell — the secret of perfect texture and tasty meat’. Well something’s gone wrong. I have to prise the meat out. It’s not tasty and the texture is terrible. It’s also watery — a sign the lobster was left out of salt water for too long before cooking because the fishermen simply didn’t take enough care. 1/5 . Twist the claws of a cooked lobster to remove them from the body. Insert a sharp knife into the back of the head and slice down to the tail to cut in half. Remove and dispose of the pale sac, gills in head area and dark intestinal thread that runs the length of the body. Remove any green meat - this is ‘tomalley’, the lobster’s digestive system and perfectly edible. Retailers have drp[[ed the price of lobster because the wholesale costs have plunged by an astonishing 70 per cent in recent years . Remove any red meat, too - these are immature eggs and are a delicacy, a sort of lobster caviar. Put both in a bowl. Combine an egg yolk with a dash of double cream, a teaspoon of brandy and teaspoon of English mustard. Whisk until you have a foamy consistency. Add the meat and season. Then pour the foam over the pre-cooked lobster, shell side down. Pop under a hot grill until golden brown — about three minutes. Enjoy! SAINSBURY’S . Taste the Difference Raw Whole Canadian Lobster, 380g, £10. This lobster may have been freighted in frozen from Canada but it looks so fresh it could have come straight from Billingsgate Fish Market in London. This is exactly how good lobster should be — packed with meaty flavour. Being raw, it’s easier to prepare than a cooked lobster, which can end up overcooked unless you’re happy to serve it totally cold. I’d cut this in half and fry in butter with a couple of crushed garlic cloves for around five minutes. It’s ready the second the meat starts to shy away from the shell. 4/5 . ALDI . Specially Selected Wild Lobster Tails with Garlic Butter (available from December 21), £9.99 for a 260g pack of two. These are really yummy — sweet and tasty and exactly what you expect from really good lobster tails. The garlic butter is excellent, and they pan-fry in under five minutes. With double the number of tails, you get a serious amount of top-quality meat for your money — at least enough for two hungry people. A pot of mayo, a platter of chips and a bottle of chilled dry white, and you have the perfect ‘date night’ feast. On the downside, you lose the wow factor of a whole lobster. 3/5 . ICELAND . Luxury Uncooked Canadian Lobster Tails, £7 for a 200g pack of two. Oh dear. There are barely a couple of mouthfuls in each tail, and the meat is so rubbery I could be chewing on my bathtime rubber duck. The instructions say to fry in the butter supplied. It’s a mistake. The butter has a horrid salty aftertaste and I need a pitcher of water to wash it away. You’d be better using your own butter. For extra flavour, add a chopped garlic clove. 2/5 .","Lobster has dropped in price recently as supermarkets compete to sell them .

"A legal victory for an online travel search company could be a big win for consumers if it translates into cheaper hotel stays. Skyscanner successfully appealed a decision by Britain’s Office of Fair Trading (OFT) over discounts on hotel room rates and is championing the judgment as a victory for consumers. The Scotland-based metasearch company argued that the original ruling by OFT, now the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), restricted consumer access to discounts. Court victory: Skyscanner won its appeal against a ruling over discounts on hotel room rates . Skyscanner took its case to the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT), which ruled in its favour and sent the case back to the CMA. Carolyn Jameson, director of general counsel at Skyscanner, said the outcome is good news for consumers and ‘the wider travel industry’. The appeal revolved around CMA’s investigation into online hotel booking in the UK following a complaint from Skoosh, an online travel agency. Skoosh complained that it was being prevented from offering discounts due to the terms of agreements between large online travel agents and hotels. In January, the CMA accepted commitments from Expedia, Booking.com and Intercontinental Hotels Group, which meant consumers would need to join a membership scheme, or closed group, to view discounted pricing for hotel rooms in the UK. The deals would only be visible to members, who would have to make one full price booking through the scheme in order to claim a discount. Better deals? Skyscanner says the judgment is good news for consumers and 'the wider travel industry' Skyscanner argued that the CMA’s original decision was not in the best interests of consumers or metasearch providers and smaller online travel agencies. Skyscanner said the closed group made it tougher for consumers to compare available rates and find the best prices because they were forced to log into multiple websites rather than visit a single website to view all the rates in one place. Ms Jameson said in a statement: ‘This reduced transparency in pricing and potentially hindered competition in the online travel market.’ The CMA said it will consider Friday’s judgment carefully before deciding on its next steps. It said in a statement: ‘The commitments concerned aimed to encourage competition by enabling online travel agents and hotels to offer discounts on rates for hotel rooms.’","Skyscanner successfully appealed a decision by the Office of Fair Trading .

"Apology: Michael Buerk has said sorry after he criticised Ched Evans' rape victim for being drunk . Michael Buerk admitted today he was 'clumsy' to argue Ched Evans' rape victim did not come out 'with any credit' as she had 'drunk so much she could barely stand'. The BBC veteran, 68,  sparked outrage, with one group saying his comments were 'deeply offensive' to women who had suffered sexual violence. Mr Buerk's remarks were made in a live trailer on the Today programme ahead of last night's episode of his Radio 4 show the Moral Maze. The Corporation later apologised after a number of complaints. He said: 'Nobody comes out of the Ched Evans rape case with any credit – not the victim who’d drunk so much she could barely stand, nor the two footballers who had sex with her in the most sordid of circumstances.’ Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live today, he said: 'If I gave the impression that the two issues of her being drunk and the rape for which Ched Evans was convicted were some sort of moral equivalent, that would be terrible and something I would need to apologise for. It was not my intention.' He said: 'If people took from it the impression that I was blaming the victim for the rape, that was absolutely not my intention. 'Having said that, the fact that the victim was drunk was the central issue in the court case. In fact, it was her case that she was so drunk she was incapable of giving consent. 'I'm not sure we're in the position where subsequently we shouldn't mention that, or perhaps I was clumsy. Buerk said he was 'totally responsible' for the content of the short trailer, which he wrote himself before it was broadcast during Radio 4's Today programme yesterday. 'Determined': Ched Evans pleaded for a second chance to play football again - and insisted he was innocent . Attack: Evans, who despite his conviction maintains his innocence, raped the girl in a Premier Inn, pictured arriving on CCTV with Clayton McDonald, in an attack also filmed by friends . Evans' victim had drunk two glasses of wine, four double vodkas and a sambuca on the night she was raped, and the jury unanimously agreed she could not have consented to sex with Evans in 2012. TV presenter Judy Finnigan sparked controversy by claiming his crime was 'non violent' and did not cause 'bodily harm' during a panel discussion on ITV's Loose Women. She also said the victim had 'had too much to drink'. The woman was raped his victim in a Rhyl Premier Inn in 2012 after his footballer friend Clayton McDonald, who was cleared of rape, texted Evans on the way there saying: 'I've got a bird'. McDonald had sex with the victim, before Evans arrived and raped her, as two others filmed it through the window. Evans apologised last night – but only to his long-suffering girlfriend for cheating on her with the teenager he was convicted of raping. In a halting video statement posted directly on to a website set up to try to clear his name, the 25-year-old said he had made ‘an incredibly foolish decision’ by having sex with the drunken girl and ‘learnt a valuable lesson’. But he failed to use the opportunity to condemn his supporters for suggesting she had lied over the attack to cash in on his status as a wealthy footballer or illegally circulating her name online. The closest he came to alluding to how his victim – now 22 – had been forced to abandon her old life was an expression of regret at ‘the damage that has been done on so many fronts’ because of that night. Prosecuted: Ched Evans, pictured on this week with his girlfriend Natasha Massey, was found guilty of rape because his victim was unable to consent . Instead he concentrated on confirming his determination to clear his name while pushing for a return to the ‘privilege’ of being a professional footballer again. TV presenter Judy Finnigan sparked controversy on ITV's Loose Women by claiming his crime was 'non violent' and also said the victim had 'had too much to drink' The 25-year-old former Sheffield United player made the comments on YouTube as his girlfriend Natasha Massey clutched his arm and wore what could be  an engagement ring. Police are investigating his family  because CCTV footage of his victim was published on his official website. The woman is seen walking into the Premier Inn in Rhyl where she was attacked by Evans, who was released from prison last week. North Wales Police told MailOnline they are 'looking into' the post named: 'Too drunk to consent, too drunk to remember?', which uses the footage from the night of the rape two years ago. The woman he attacked, 22, continues to be targeted by trolls who support Evans. She has had to start a new life away from her friends and family in north Wales after nine people were convicted of illegally naming her in 2012. She was named at least 6,000 times on Twitter alone following the conviction of Wales international Evans and was labelled a 'slag', 'tramp', 'bitch' and 'whore'. Police put her 'relocation package' together after her lifelong anonymity — protection afforded to anyone who has made and allegation of a sexual assault — was breached on the internet. But Twitter trolls have continued to pursue her even though illegal naming carries a maximum fine of £5,000, and now claim to have revealed her new identity. She may have to take another new name and move again.","Michael Buerk said victim did not come out of rape case 'with any credit'

"Growing problem: The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges has drawn up an action plan in response to worrying obesity rates in the UK (posed by  a model) Doctors today demanded a 20 per cent tax on fizzy drinks and a ban on fast-food outlets near schools to tackle Britain’s obesity problem. The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges has drawn up an action plan in response to the UK’s current status as the fat man of Europe. Among the proposals is an experimental 20 per cent tax on sugary soft drinks, like that in operation in parts of the US, for at least a year. The potential annual yield of £1billion could help fund weight management programmes, the academy said. It added that councils should limit the number of fast food outlets allowed to operate near schools, colleges, leisure centres and other places where children gather. Another recommendation was that hospitals get rid of vending machines selling unhealthy products on their premises. The academy said it is ‘perplexing’ to find canteens in hospitals selling unhealthy dishes, and ‘even more astonishing that in many hospital receptions patients pass by high street fast food franchises or vending machines selling confectionary, drinks and crisps’. New parents, the organisation continues, should be taught by health experts how to feed their children properly, to avoid them getting hooked on sweet or fatty foods while still very young. In addition, NHS staff should routinely talk to overweight patients about their eating and exercise habits  at every appointment under a policy of ‘making every contact count’. The academy, which effectively speaks for the entire medical profession, said urgent action is needed from ministers, the NHS, councils and food producers to break the cycle of ‘generation after generation falling victim to obesity-related illnesses and death’. Its report says doctors are ‘united in seeing the epidemic of obesity as the greatest public health crisis facing the UK’. Plans: The academy has come up with a number of recommendations, including that hospitals should get rid of vending machines selling unhealthy products on their premises and that councils should limit the number of fast food outlets near schools . Its members criticised attempts by successive governments to solve the problem as  ‘piecemeal and disappointingly ineffective’. The academy proposals follow a year-long inquiry into the country’s spiralling weight crisis. One in four adults in England is obese, and figures are predicted to rise to 60 per cent of men, half of women and a quarter of children by 2050. The academy recommends that the NHS spends at least £300million over the next three years to tackle a serious shortage in weight-management programmes, so more patients  can be  helped ‘in a supportive and sensitive manner’. Academy chairman Professor Terence Stephenson said the report did not claim to offer a full solution to the obesity epidemic, but ‘it does say we need together to do more, starting right now, before the problem becomes worse and the NHS can no longer cope’. The report claims it contains measures that ‘society as a whole needs to take to prevent the obesity crisis becoming unresolvable’. It adds: ‘Just as the challenges of persuading society that the deeply embedded habit of smoking was against its better interests, changing how we eat and exercise is now a matter of necessity.’ The academy’s guidelines will be announced in full today.","Academy of Medical Royal Colleges called for urgent action to tackle problem .

"Thousands of Australians scored illegal drugs from a website run like eBay, where they could check out reviews on dope, meth, ecstasy and cocaine and order their highs through the post at a quarter of the street price. A 30-year-old Texan man named Ross Ulbricht is alleged by the FBI to have created the website and to have run it from a Bondi apartment in Sydney for the first six months, but he has plead not guilty to the charges against him. Lawyer turned journalist Eileen Ormsby, from Melbourne, began investigating online drug supermarket Silk Road in 2011 after a woman she met at a party told her how easy it was to buy drugs from it. Despite it being a global website, reportedly founded in the US, ‘Australian users were definitely over represented because there were higher quality drugs on there,’ Ms Ormsby told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Texan man named Ross William Ulbricht has been charged as being the site's pseudonymous founder Dread Pirate Roberts . ‘The drugs were also much, much cheaper than in Australia,’ she explained. 'The most popular drug was MDMA. A gram is $300 on the street but only $80 online.' Silk Road, which has since been shut down by the FBI, was an online black market and part of the Deep Web that it operated as a Tor hidden service, meaning online users were able to browse it anonymously and securely without being detected by authorities. The journalist began hanging out on the site’s online forums, which you could access by downloading tor software to your computer and by trading in the online currency Bitcoin, and spoke with many users of the site. ‘The online forums were very busy and there were a lot of Australians. I was gobsmacked that it existed or that it worked,’ she said. Ms Ormsby was also shocked at the type of people she met on the website. ‘They came across as quite intelligent and engaged, then I got interested in the whole business model and how it was so openly advertised on forums like Reddit,’ she explained. Mr Ulbricht was arrested by the FBI in 2013 and will go on trial on January 5 in New York . On Silk Road people could buy dope, meth, ecstasy and cocaine and order their highs through the post . As well as people looking to buy drugs, Ms Ormsby also spoke with the in-house doctor for the website that was there to provide advice. His family and friends believe he is falsely accused and innocent of the charges . ‘He’s just interested in harm reduction and giving realistic advice about drugs. There is no point in just saying “don’t do it” to people who are already using,’ she reasoned. Ms Ormsby had correspondence with a person who created the website who goes by the pseudonym of Dread Pirate Roberts. Texan man Mr Ulbricht has been charged as being the site's pseudonymous founder Dread Pirate Roberts and was arrested by the FBI in 2013. Mr Ulbricht allegedly wanted to create a Utopian market place and during the site’s early stages he lived in Bondi. The 30-year-old will go on trial on January 5 charged with conspiracy to narcotics trafficking; computer hacking; money laundering; engaging in a criminal enterprise; and conspiracy to traffic in fraudulent IDs. He was taken into custody by federal agents at a San Francisco public library in 2013. But his family and friends believe he is falsely accused and innocent of the charges. He has also pleaded not guilty to all charges. Ms Ormsby spoke to Dread Pirate Roberts by private direct messages online. ‘We had lots of private messages. He tended to be fairly guarded but he was always polite and he really believed in what he was doing. Lawyer turned journalist Eileen Ormsby investigated the website for two years . She has written the 'true story of the world's most notorious online drug market' (left) ‘By all accounts he lived very simply considering he allegedly had nearly one hundred million dollars in Bitcoin,’ Ms Ormsby said. Silk Road had over a million registered users by the time it was shut down and Ms Ormsby believes it provided a safer alternative for people to buy drugs than on the streets. ‘Obviously it’s impossible to have any form of violence taking part online. There is also quality control because people get rated out of five just like on eBay,’ she explained. ‘There were people doing independent testing of all the drugs so you know what you are getting, not like the so called legal highs that are mimicking the real drugs and getting sold in nightclubs.’ Although people did still get ripped off on the site, it was run in an organised way were people would sign up and advertise their wares for sale. Despite Silk Road being shut down on 6 November 2013 Silk Road 2.0 came online soon after . Users would come online and search for what they wanted, for example ecstasy pills, and pop it in their online baskets. ‘The money would go into the site until the user had received their drugs in the post,’ Ms Ormsby said. Despite Silk Road being shut down on 6 November 2013 Silk Road 2.0 came online, said to be run by former administrators of Silk Road. It was also closed on 6 November 2014 but at least 20 more similar sites are available for drug users. Ms Ormsby doesn’t believe authorities will ever really be able to control them. ‘There is a whole move to decentralise the markets and purely online currency is being used more and more,’ she said. The incredible true story of Silk Road's rise and fall, Silk Road by Eileen Ormsby, is out now with Pan Macmillan Australia.

"A woman has been arrested on suspicion of murder following the death of a 96-year-old woman at a care home. Ethel Baldwin died at Abbey House Care Home in Southampton, Hampshire on September 13 after staff called police on August 29 following a suspected assault. Hampshire Police confirmed a 36-year-old woman had been arrested in connection with her death. A woman has been arrested on suspicion of murder following the death of a 96-year-old woman at Abbey House Nursing Home in Hampshire (pictured) The woman, described as a 'much loved' resident by a spokesman for the home, had been receiving palliative care there for two years at the time of her death. A Hampshire Police spokesman said: 'Specialist officers have been liaising with the care home and family members to establish the circumstances of this death and to ensure the safeguarding of other residents at the care home,' a spokesman said. 'A 36-year-old woman from Southampton has today been arrested on suspicion of murder and is helping police with their enquiries.' Police are yet to confirm or deny whether the woman arrested today is a member of staff at the home. The 48-bedroomed care home is thought to be open as normal while police quiz the woman arrested today . The home, where it is thought Ms Baldwin was a resident, is adjacent to the historic Netley Abbey in Southampton, Hampshire . A statement released by the care home today said: 'In line with its long-established ‘no tolerance’ policy towards abuse, Abbey House Nursing Home notified both the safeguarding authority and the police as soon as managers and care staff became aware on 29th August that one of its residents may have been assaulted.' 'We have since been cooperating fully with the police in their investigation into the incident. Sadly, Ethel passed away on 13th September. We extend our sincere condolences to her family. 'It is our understanding that all the parties involved consider this to have been an isolated incident that does not reflect an underlying problem at the nursing home.' 'Clearly, our priority now must be to provide reassurance to our other residents and their families.'

"Ed Miliband held private talks in his Commons office with the  disgraced Co-op Bank boss embroiled in a drugs scandal, it emerged last night. The revelation left the Labour leader facing potentially damaging questions about his relationship with the Reverend Paul Flowers. Flowers is being investigated by the police after being caught on film apparently buying hard drugs, including crack cocaine and crystal meth. Paul Flowers is being investigated by the police after being caught on film apparently buying hard drugs, including crack cocaine and crystal meth . Co-op last night announced a complete review of the fiasco, as Labour leader Ed Miliband faced questions over hiring Flowers as a business adviser . But last night it emerged that Flowers had enjoyed astonishing access and influence at the top of the Labour establishment for years. Labour sources confirmed that Mr Miliband had personally appointed Flowers to his elite Business and Industry Advisory Group in 2010 — and even invited him for private talks in his Commons office last year. It also emerged that Flowers described Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls as a ‘political friend’ and boasted of helping to arrange a £50,000 donation for him from the Co-op last year. Both Mr Miliband and Mr Balls deny being close to Flowers, who was suspended by Labour last night for ‘bringing the party into disrepute.’ A spokesman for Mr Balls, one of 32 Labour MPs sponsored by the Co-op, said he had never held a meeting with Flowers and never discussed the donation with him. The near-collapse of the Co-op Bank is embarrassing for Labour, which has long ties with the organisation. Last year Mr Miliband hailed the firm as the future of banking in a speech at the its headquarters. And many MPs receive financial support from the Co-op, including shadow Treasury chief secretary Chris Leslie, shadow Europe minister Gareth Thomas and shadow constitutional reform minister Stephen Twigg. Labour’s Business and Industry Advisory Group was set up by Mr Miliband to provide him with personal advice on business policy. Caught on camera: The Rev Paul Flowers was filmed counting money for drugs . Having parked up, Paul Flowers counts out £300 in £20 notes before handing the cash over for a drugs deal . The video and a series of damning text messages were handed to The Mail on Sunday by acquaintance Stuart Davies, who was 'disgusted by his hypocrisy' Flowers was one of 20 members of the group, which held meetings in 2011 and 2012. It has now been superseded by other Labour business forums.Asked about the appointment yesterday, Mr Miliband said: ‘He was involved in the Co-op and that is no longer the case. I think we will leave it there. You appoint people from a whole range of backgrounds to look at a whole range of issues and we have a range of business people working with us. ‘The police are looking into the matter and I’m not going to comment on an ongoing investigation. Suffice to say that group no longer exists. We should let the police inquiry take its course.’ Labour was last night unable to shed light on the meeting Mr Miliband held with Flowers at the Commons in March last year, describing it as a ‘private meeting’. But sources said it should come as ‘no surprise’ that the chairman of the Co-op Bank, which has historic ties to Labour, would be asked for advice on issues such as banking reform. In evidence to MPs earlier this month, Flowers said Mr Balls  had played a pivotal role in  supporting legislation that enabled the Co-op Bank’s disastrous 2009 merger with the Britannia Building Society. The Co-op gave Labour £750,000 in donations in 2009, the year the Britannia merger went through. Labour also benefits from a  £1.3 million loan from the cash-strapped Co-op. A spokesman for Mr Balls, who was the keynote speaker at the Co-operative Party’s gala dinner this year, insisted he had few dealings with Flowers. He said: ‘Ed’s been to a few events which Paul has also been at, but he’s never had a meeting or phone conversation with him. 'The Co-op group donated £50,000 to the shadow chancellor’s office, which was declared in the normal way. Ed has never discussed the donation with Paul Flowers.’ Flowers became the first former Co-op boss to reveal the enthusiasm of Mr Balls for the disastrous 2009 merger with Britannia, which helped bring the lender to its knees. While he denied political interference, he said: ‘Balls was particularly supportive of us – talking to us and encouraging us.’ Flowers said Mr Balls was not at the Treasury at the time but was the Schools Minister. A Treasury Select Committee also heard Mr Balls has a close relationship with the bank’s parent, the Co-operative Group, which gave his office £50,000 in donations last year.","Methodist minister Paul Flowers, 63, caught on camera buying drugs .

"The former nanny to Fred and Rose West has told of her ordeal at the hands of two of Britain's worst serial killers. Caroline Roberts was just 17 when, in 1972, she went to work at the Wests' infamous 25 Cromwell Street home in Gloucester, where nine bodies were discovered more than 20 years later. What she witnessed and went through at their hands was to serve as a chilling prelude to the series of at least 12 murders the couple would go on to commit. Ms Roberts - called Caroline Owens in 1972 - was abducted and raped by the Wests but managed to escape. She went to the police but the couple ended up getting off with a fine for indecent assault because Ms Roberts was too scared to face them in court. Scroll down for video . Caroline Roberts was abducted by Rose and Fred West in 1972 before they went on their killing spree . Rose West was convicted of 10 murders in November 1995 and is still serving life in prison. Fred West was charged with 12 murders, but committed suicide at Winson Green jail in Birmingham before his trial . The then-teenager was picked up by the Wests while hitch-hiking and they later offered her a job looking after their three children. Soon after she started work at their home, she picked up on the couple's warped attitudes and Fred West's obsession with sex. In a new interview to be broadcast on Channel 5 tomorrow night, she recalls Fred West saying: 'I've performed these abortions on girls before and they turn around and they're so grateful they just have sex with me straight after.' Ms Roberts said: 'I thought - that's not right that's weird.' The Wests later invited Ms Roberts to join their sex circle but she declined and left her job with them. She said: 'I knew that was something I didn't want to be a part of.' But weeks later, the teenager was walking home and was offered a lift by Fred West, who pulled up alongside her. Moments later, the killer hit her over the head. Ms Roberts - pictured around the time she was abducted - says she now feels guilty she didn't do more to alert police to the danger the couple posed . She said: 'I blacked out. When I came back round my hands were already tied behind my back and there was Fred wrapping tape around my mouth.' In a apparent warning of what the couple would later do to their victims, they told her: 'We are going to keep you in the cellar and let our friends use you and, when they have finished with you, we will kill you and bury you under the paving stones of Gloucester. There are hundreds of girls there... the police haven't found them and they won't find you!' Ms Roberts, who feared the couple would try and 'operate' on her, was raped by Fred West, but later managed to escape. She told the police, but the charge against the Wests was dropped to indecent assault after Ms Roberts decided she did not want to be questioned in court. In the new TV documentary, she says she now feels guilty about the decision, which may have allowed the couple to go free to commit their murders. The new documentary also features what is believed to be the last interview given by the lesbian lover of both Fred and Rose West, Kathryn Halliday. Ms Halliday was a neighbour who was invited to the couple's home after telling Fred West she was a lesbian. She said she liked the husband - who she met after the couple had killed all their known victims - but found Rose West 'very cold'. In the interview, given before her recent death from liver cancer, said: 'She was very, very domineering and she was quite domineering over Fred. 'He only ever touched me once. We only ever had sex once but he was a wee bit more gentle. She was very cold.' Ms Roberts was employed by the couple to look after their children at their infamous 25 Cromwell Street home . A newspaper report from the time of the couple's attack on Ms Roberts, for which they received a £100 fine . The couple then showed Ms Halliday their bondage equipment and sexual torture instruments, causing her break off their friendship. She turned down an invitation to spend Christmas with them, a decision she believes saved her life. She said: 'I think this is what saved my life. Rose went ballistic when I said I wasn't going to stay there. I, for one, just hope she rots in hell.' Fred West was charged with 12 murders, but committed suicide at Winson Green jail in Birmingham before his trial. Rose West was convicted of 10 murders in November 1995 and is still serving life in prison. Their house was later demolished and turned into a public walkway.

"From spiders reflected in dew drops nestled on their webs, to ladybirds wearing droplets like backpacks, an Italian photographer has managed to perfectly capture the intricate and delicate qualities of nature. During walks in Italian wetlands, Alberto Ghizzi Panizza captured wasp spiders, primrose flowers, moths and ladybirds through early morning dew droplets. The 39-year-old photographer spent hours working out the best angles and distances to capture nature reflected in all its glory. The intricate shots were taken by 39-year-old Italian photographer Alberto Ghizzi Panizza during early morning walks in wetlands around the Guastalla region of Italy. The macro photographs were captured first thing in the morning using a Nikon D7100 camera. This photo shows a wasp spider reflected in dew drops nestled on its spiral orb web . All the images were shot using a Nikon D7100 camera, with a focal length of 40mm and a two-second shutter speed. Previously, Mr Panizza has used the same equipment and processes to capture damselflies, and snails on lilypads. He compared the dew drops reflected in the spider’s web to a fairground hall of mirrors. The wasp spider is a species of orb-web spider found across Europe and north Africa. It gets its name from the yellow, black and white striped on its large abdomen. The spider builds its spiral webs at sunrise, or sunset. To kill its prey, the female of the species wraps flies and other small insects in silk before biting them. This bite paralyses the prey and begins dissolving protein in its body. Mr Panizza spotted the insects on an early morning walk through the wetlands around the Guastalla region of Italy. The photographer, from Parma, said: ‘I love to take pictures early in the morning surrounded by the sounds of nature. ‘I go to this spot many times a week and on this occasion left my car beside the road and walked through a path into the woods. ‘In the beginning it was tough to find the insects, but after 10 years of taking pictures, I've trained my eyes to discover them between the flowers. I love the reflections in the drops of dew on the spiderwebs. ‘Sometimes I saw spiders cleaning their webs, making the dew fall off. ‘Flying insects wait to dry their wings before moving away and this is the perfect moment to take pictures of them. ‘You must have a lot of good combinations to take a perfect picture, like the right humidity, light and there should be absolutely no wind. ‘But the most difficult thing to work with is the position of the insects, which I normally find hidden between branches and bushes. ‘For the drops of dew it's better to take pictures of the smallest ones as these are the perfect spheres. And he admitted that finding the perfect reflection is the most difficult task when taking such detailed macro photographs.

This image shows dew drops on a ladybird. Mr Panizza said that flying insects wait to dry their wings before moving away, making it the perfect moment to take pictures of them. He uses focus stacking - a digital process that uses multiple images to create a greater field of depth - to produce the  focus effect . ‘You have to find the perfect position with the right angulation and the perfect distance from the lens and the subject,’ explained the photographer. ‘But once you have learned to do so you can see the reflex with your own eyes and not only through the camera. ‘I think the fact you can see the insects reflected in each droplet is a normal physical effect because the drops have the same effect of a fisheye lens. ‘The first time I saw this I was really surprised and usually people think that the pictures must use Photoshop but it isn't so, it's all done by nature.’ Previously, Mr Panizza has used the same process to capture damselflies, snails on lilypads, moths with a primrose flower reflected in a droplet on its back (pictured left), and a spider sat on a droplet (right). Focus stacking helps to highlight to highlight the detail of the insect, the flower it is on, and the dew, for example .

"Outrageous: James Tracy claims that the government was behind the Boston Marathon bomber that left 3 dead and more than 180 injured . The so-called 'Nutty Professor' who said the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting never happened is now willing to concede some people, indeed, lost their lives in the tragedy. But James Tracy, a Florida Atlantic University tenured communications professor, is only seemingly willing to meet his many detractors half-way in their demands for outright contrition. 'There are certainly people that lost their loved ones, there is no doubt of that,' Tracy tells WLRN in Miami. 'If a similar tragedy were visited upon me and my family, I would be beside myself,' he reportedly said. 'But I think one of my ways of healing would be attempting to find out what went wrong, where was the failure.' The 47-year-old professor suggested on his blog - memoryholeblog.com - the massacre at the least did not unfold in the way authorities said it did, and may not have happened at all.

Hook shooting continue to be assessed and interpreted by independent . researchers there is a growing awareness that the media coverage of the . massacre of 26 children and adults was intended primarily for public . consumption to further larger political ends,' he wrote on his blog. Tracy has seemingly based his allegations largely on the flurry of conflicting media reports released during the hectic day. Shut down: Sandy Hook Elementary School is now closed, seen here on January 3, but a professor in Florida argues that the shooting that took place in the school may not have happened as is conventionally believed . Tragic: One of the points of professor James Tracy's argument is the fact that there have been no photos of the bodies of the 20 child victims or the six teachers . However, as far as he's concerned, the . media is still the one to blame for not pushing authorities hard enough . on the tough questions. In his WLRN interview, Tracy never . apologizes for his prior remarks, but instead adds, 'The news media . swooped into Newtown very briefly to cover the tragedy in a very . vampiric sort of way, then swooped back out again without giving us any . real answers. 'Then, they immediately went into the . grieving mode. I'm not saying there's not a place for that. But if we . want to actually pay homage to the events, we want to find out what . actually went wrong. That's the greatest honor we can give them.' The professor also responded to calls . for his immediate termination, saying: 'I am sure (FAU is) receiving . emails that are emotionally driven, but I would think if FAU wishes to . revoke my tenure and terminate me, that's a blow against academics' being able to speak their minds on the events of the day.' Political ends: He argues that the shooting was enabled in order to speed up legislation against guns . As with many conspiracy theorists who . find darker linings in even the most horrific tragedies, this is far . from his first foray into the world of the unproven. Mr Tracy has written a number of book chapters about media coverage of wars, economic overhauls and union negotiations. On . his blog, however, he has hit a number of the classic conspiracy . theories: the September 11 attacks, the purview of the Department of . Homeland Security, the PATRIOT Act, the death of Osama bin Laden and . Fukishima have all been topics of interest. Even though he is paid to teach a . class called Culture of Conspiracy which will undoubtedly produce . outrageous ideas, Florida Atlantic University appears to feel that the . questioning of the murder of first graders was a bridge too far. 'James . Tracy does not speak for the university. The website on which his post . appeared is not affiliated with FAU in any way. As for any previous . disciplinary actions at FAU, we do not comment on personnel matters,' school spokesman Lisa Metcalf said to the Sun Sentinel.","James Tracy, a Florida Atlantic University professor, still thinks something's fishy about official accounts of the Newtown shooting .

"Britain is ‘leaving the financial crisis behind’ and is the fastest growing major economy in the developed world, global experts declared yesterday. The International Monetary Fund said the UK economy will expand by 3.2 per cent this year, outstripping the rest of the G7 including the United States, Germany and France. Growth in Britain is set to be more than twice as fast as in Germany and eight times stronger than in France while Italy is heading for another year of decline. The report warned that the eurozone poses a major threat to the global economy. ‘Among advanced countries, the United States and the United Kingdom in particular are leaving the financial crisis behind and achieving decent growth,’ said IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard. IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard, pictured, said UK economic growth was twice as fast as Germany . Launching the IMF’s latest World Economic Output report in Washington, he added: ‘Growth in the euro nearly stalled earlier this year, even in the core.’ George Osborne – accused by Mr Blanchard last year of ‘playing with fire’ by pressing ahead with austerity – said the report was ‘further evidence the Government’s long economic plan is working’. Unemployment in the UK is set to fall from today’s 6.2 per cent to 5.8 per cent next year, according to the IMF, well below its 11.2 per cent forecast for the eurozone. Mr Blanchard warned that the single currency bloc faces a devastating bout of deflation – falling prices – which could derail the global recovery. His comments came as it emerged in Berlin that industrial output in Germany tumbled 4 per cent in August. It was the biggest drop since 2009. Mr Blanchard said: ‘There is a risk the recovery in the euro area could stall, that demand could weaken further, and that low inflation could turn into deflation. Should such a scenario play out, it would be the major issue confronting the world economy.’ Mr Blanchard criticised George Osborne, pictured, for continuing his austerity policy as 'playing with fire' The IMF said it expects growth of 0.8 per cent in the eurozone this year compared with the 1.1 per cent it forecast in July. It slashed its forecast for Germany from 1.9 per cent to 1.4 per cent, halved its French figure from 0.8 per cent to 0.4 per cent and predicted a contraction of 0.2 per cent in Italy. By contrast, Britain is expected to grow by 2.7 per cent next year – on top of 3.2 per cent this year. ‘The United Kingdom’s economy is expected to continue to grow strongly,’ the report said. But the IMF warned that ‘buoyant’ house prices pose ‘challenges’ for a number of countries including the UK. The IMF cut its global growth forecasts from 3.4 per cent to 3.3 per cent for this year and from 4 per cent to 3.8 per cent for 2015. ‘The recovery continues but it is weak and uneven,’ said Mr Blanchard. ‘Some countries have recovered or nearly recovered. But others are still struggling.’","The IMF said the UK was on course to expand its economy by 3.2 per cent .

"Lewis Hamilton came to the oil-and-rags track at Spa-Francorchamps via the glitziest address in Washington DC. Ahead of Sunday’s Belgian Grand Prix, the British driver recalled meeting President Obama and told how Stevie Wonder had to wait in the queue while the leader of the free world lingered to talk about Formula One with him. But after the summer break, part of which Hamilton’s Mercedes team-mate and only title rival Nico Rosberg spent hunting for the best pizza in Naples, there is a growing sense that the intensity of the world championship fight is heightening. Welcome break: Lewis Hamilton (left) has returned from the Formula One holiday ready to race at Spa . Preparation: Mercedes driver Hamilton met with US President Barack Obama in the build-up to the race . Favoured: Obama kept talking to Hamilton about F1, leaving singing legend Stevie Wonder waiting in the queue . Rivalry: Hamilton and Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg (left) are in direct competition for the title . The niggle is sharper. The barbs carry more weight. ‘I am not hiding anything from Nico,’ said Hamilton. ‘He has all my data. I never, never ever have asked my guys, “Don’t show that to Nico.” Actually I want him to be at his best, because it is more painful when you are at your best and getting beaten.’ Hamilton first has to overhaul Rosberg’s 11-point lead before worrying about rubbing the German’s nose in the gravel trap. This weekend presents an opportunity for each of the title combatants to prove his worth. Spa is a true racer’s track. At 4.3 miles, it is the longest of the year, a rollercoaster of high-speed straights and fast corners hidden among the high trees of the Ardennes forest. Its glory is the plunge-and-climb corner, Eau Rouge. The new twitchier cars of 2014 will be a handful through there, so much so that Jenson Button, the veteran McLaren driver, admitted he ‘let out a few screams inside my crash helmet’ during practice on Friday. At the head of the time sheets were the Mercedes duo, predictably. Hamilton set the fastest time of the day, with Rosberg six-tenths of a second tardier. Determined: Hamilton is hoping to life his second world title this season but he is second in the championship . Competition: Rosberg leads the drivers' championship by 11 points heading into the Belgian Grand Prix . Hunger: German driver Nico Rosberg spent the F1 break travelling around Napoli finding the perfect pizza . ‘It stayed dry throughout both sessions but the forecast is wet for qualifying tomorrow, so it was important to maximise track time as this may be our last dry running before the race,’ said Hamilton. ‘We’ve seen rain so often here in the past and that can really mix things up — particularly when it’s wet in places and dry in others. ‘I want to keep my head down like a bull — nothing can really stand in the way of a bull. But my team-mate wants to be the wall that gets in the way, so I will try to manoeuvre it the best way I can this weekend, and win.’ It felt as though Bernie Ecclestone was back in control. In fact, the sport’s supremo had hardly been away, but merely distracted by his bribery trial in Germany. He paid £60million and the case was dropped, with no implication of guilt in official wording of the court. He was in typically feisty form here during a series of interviews. On the inaugural Russian Grand Prix planned for October 12, he told the BBC: ‘I asked somebody the other day, “have they decided who shot that plane down?” Nobody seems to know, do they? So what’s the link? Cool: Lewis Hamilton has water tipped over his head as he takes part in the Ice Bucket Challenge at Spa . Dark skies: Nico Rosberg drivers around the Spa circuit during practice at the Belgian Grand Prix on Friday . Focused: Hamilton is determined to take back some initiative in the title race by winning the Belgian Grand Prix . ‘In England, for example, we have sent guns and things to people that have been used, and we’re responsible? Doesn’t sound right does it?’ Two Maxes - Chilton, of Marussia, and Verstappen, who is destined to race for Toro Rosso next year aged 17 - also left their marks on the day. As of Thursday night Chilton, a British racer who pays for his drive, was due to step aside for this race. It appeared his funding had got clogged up. Yet, mysteriously, he was reinstated on Friday morning. Why the U-turn? ‘I can’t tell you,’ was the gist of Chilton’s non-explanation, ‘but it’s not what you think.’ So what did we think it was, we asked? ‘I’m not saying,’ he said. How absurd can you get? As for Verstappen, the son of the former Dutch F1 driver Jos Verstappen, he was unflappable when he appeared in front of the media for the first time. He revealed that he has not completed his schooling yet and will fit lessons and exams around his racing schedule. ‘Excuse me, sir,’ one imagined he might say come next May, ‘but can I leave class early - I’ve got to race in the Monaco Grand Prix?’ New kid on the block: 16-year-old Max Verstappen appeared in front of the media for the first time on Friday .","Hamilton met President Obama while Stevie Wonder waited in a queue .

"She's widely touted as one of the most naturally beautiful women in Hollywood, and now the secret behind Jessica Alba's flawless complexion has been revealed. The actress, 33, has been unveiled as the face of the Braun Face - and epilator that doubles as a deep-pore cleansing brush - and she credits the gadget for giving her glowing skin. Speaking about the £69.99 product, Jessica said: 'It doesn't matter whether you're going for a red carpet look, or want a day without any make-up on; we need to be able to count on beautifully cleansed skin as our foundation. 'Braun Face gives women the confidence and freedom to either wear make-up or not.' Scroll down for video . Flawless: Jessica Alba, 33, has been unveiled as the face of the Braun Face - and epilator that doubles as a deep-pore cleansing brush - and credits the gadget for giving her that famous dewy glow (she is the ambassador, though!) The makers claim that the sonic cleansing technology gently but thoroughly sweeps away make-up, pollution and impurities while preparing the skin to absorb beauty products more efficiently. In the flick of a switch, it transforms into a facial epilator to remove hairs on the eyebrows, upper lip and chin. Jessica has been working with the beauty giant since March this year and the stylish mother-of-two is the perfect advert for the healthy lifestyle she advocates in the accompanying imagery. Speaking about their choice, a spokesperson for the beauty brand said at the time: 'Jessica Alba is a strong, passionate woman and an advocate for others - she is the perfect ambassador to talk about the role beauty and our products play in helping women to feel their best. 'Braun admires her for her principles, her talents and her ability to juggle a demanding acting career with being a great mum.' Poster girl: Jessica has been working with the beauty giant since March this year and is the perfect advert for the healthy lifestyle she advocates in the accompanying imagery . Perfect choice: Speaking about their choice, a spokesperson for the beauty brand said at the time: 'Jessica Alba is a strong, passionate woman and an advocate for others - she is the perfect ambassador' Jessica's acting career began at the tender age of 12. After studying at the Atlantic Theatre, she went on to star in James Cameron’s Dark Angel, gaining worldwide recognition. She has since made over 25 feature films such as The Fantastic Four and Sin City. The actress - who has emerged as a stylish role model for working mothers with her all-natural baby product line, Honest - has two children - Honor Marie, age five, and Haven Garner, age two - with her husband, Cash Warren. Only two years after its launch, the entrepreneur is set to float her eco-friendly nappy business, The Honest Company, and cash in on its valuation. This year, the annual revenue of her business is expected to be more than $150m (£93m), three times the annual revenue in 2013. So no wonder the savvy star has decided that now is the time to cash-in. Mumpreneur: Only two years the launch of her eco-friendly company, The Honest Company, the entrepreneur is set to float her eco-friendly nappy business and cash in on its billion pound valuation . She set up the company in 2012 with Christopher Gavigan - the former CEO of Healthy Child Healthy World. They started with a line of 'non-toxic' nappies featuring appealing prints and other 'natural' baby products, before adding bath, body and house-cleaning supplies. Jessica has previously spoken about dividing her time between her family, acting and The Honest Co. 'It's an imperfect balance and I am not sure if I do it very well. I spend most of my time at the office, but my kids' health and wellbeing is my priority. I talk to my [business] partners about my responsibility with my children,' she said recently speaking to Fortune. 'I have worked around board meetings and conferences. With email, I am still involved in the process of design and it is easy to share files with Dropbox. I can still work on product development that way.' Hollywood star: Jessica, pictured at the Mission Hills World Celebrity Pro-Am opening ceremony in Haikou, China, last week, began acting at the tender age of 12 . Forget soap and water - these days, women are ditching flannels in favour of electric face brushes to help give skin a super-deep clean. First on the scene, in 2009, was the £150 Clarisonic, but since then the market has exploded. Now, every major skincare brand, from Boots' No7 to Mary Kay, has their own. Last month, budget store Lidl announced a £9.99 version - including a year's worth of replacement heads (most manufacturers suggest replacing heads every three months, or when bristles become worn). While features vary, broadly speaking, there are two technologies: vibrating and rotating. There's no independent research to suggest one technology is superior, and most experts agree that, in general, all face brushes can be good for skin. 'Face brushes make a ritual of cleansing, which can mean women are more likely to cleanse thoroughly,' says Dr Sam Bunting, a Harley Street cosmetic dermatologist. 'Used correctly, they can help remove more surface dirt than manual cleansing, meaning the products you use penetrate better.' Devotees claim they leave skin more toned and radiant, but Dr Bunting warns they need to be used with care: 'There is the potential for over-cleansing, damaging the skin, and they can even cause breakouts. It's about using it when your skin needs it, with an appropriate cleanser, such as Cetaphil, that won't over-dry your skin.'","Jessica, 33, is ambassador for Braun Face .

"Britain is issuing the largest number of 'landlord loans' since records began, official figures have revealed. One in eight mortgages now a buy-to-let loan deal - an all-time high, the report said. Of the 11.3million mortgages in this country, 1.44million are buy-to-let loans, rather than standard residential mortgages. Out of 11.3million mortgages in Britain 1.44million are buy-to-let loans . A decade ago, there were only 275,500 buy-to-let loans, equal to just 2.4 per cent of the entire market. Today the number of buy-to-let loans is equal to 12.7 per cent, according to the figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders. The change is partly because a generation of young people have been locked out of the housing market by soaring house prices. With an average house price of nearly £160,000, which is more than six times higher than the average salary, a generation of young people cannot afford to buy their own home. To make matters worse, the average monthly rent has climbed to £741 per month, which inhibits their ability to save money every month towards a deposit. Last month, a report from the Financial Services Authority, the City regulator, said the buy-to-let boom has added to the problem of people trying to buy. News of the boom comes just a day after the Housing Minister slammed the country's housing market as 'dysfunctional', citing its impact on young people. Mark Prisk, a Tory MP, said it 'cannot be right' that large numbers of people in their 20s and 30s cannot afford to buy their own home. In his first speech to the country's mortgage lenders, he warned of a generation of young people who have no choice but to live at home unwillingly. Mr Prisk, a former chartered surveyor, said the coalition Government has inherited 'a dysfunctional housing market whether it is freehold or leasehold.' He said: 'We see 1.6million young people – people in their 20s and 30s – still living with Mum and Dad because they can't afford their own place. 'That cannot be right.' It said: 'The increase in the prices of properties attractive to first-time buyers may have been fueled by buy-to-let investors who targeted the same type of properties.' Tory MP Mark Prisk claims the government has inherited a 'dysfunctional' housing market . The FSA said the average age at which a young person manages to buy their first home is 31 and they earn an average salary of around £34,000. By comparison, a typical buy-to-let investor is between the age of 45 and 64 and is a higher rate taxpayer, which means they earn more than £42,475. Dan McLeod, a director of the estate agency Atkinson McLeod, said: 'The demand from investors for buy-to-let has never been stronger.' With the base rate at an all-time low of 0.5 per cent, which means savers get pathetic rates close to zero, many decide to put their nest egg into property as an alternative to saving. Yesterday the Bank of England's interest-rate setting committee voted to keep the base rate at 0.5 per cent for the 44th consecutive month, the longest period during which rates have not been changed since the aftermath of the Second World War. One economist, Stephen Boyle, from the Royal Bank of Scotland, said: 'It currently feels as if the Bank is unlikely to change rates until most of us are well into our retirement. ' ark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said: 'The rise in buy-to-let lending comes as no surprise, with low interest rates and rising demand for rental property from tenants making the private rental sector an attractive investment proposition.' One economist yesterday raised his fears for the future, if the Bank's funding for lending scheme, aimed at boosting money available to businesses and homeowners, does not work. With rates at rock-bottom levels and its money-printing programme, known as quantitative easing, hitting £375billion, it is not clear what more it can do to kick start the economy. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, the consultancy, said: 'The danger is that the Bank of England is looking increasingly helpless, working with ineffectual policy tools in an economy that looks set to worsen, which will do nothing to boost business and consumer confidence.'","Of the 11.3million mortgages in UK 1.44million are buy-to-let .

"A suspected New Jersey drug dealer was apparently hoping to capitalize on the ongoing Ebola outbreak when he named his product after the deadly virus. Barnabas Davis, 47, who goes by the moniker ‘Hammer,’ was arrested Monday for allegedly being in possession of 633 wax fold of heroin labeled 'Ebola.' Ralph Stocco, of the Toms River Police Department, clarified that the drugs did not actually contain the pathogen responsible for some 4,500 deaths, but rather the name was part of Davis' marketing strategy.

"David Cameron has told EU chief Jose Manuel Barroso that the British people want migration from Europe ‘fixed’ – and he promised detailed proposals by Christmas on how he will do it. The Prime Minister hit back at Mr Barroso, who declared on a visit to London that curbs on migrants from the Continent would be ‘illegal’ and Britain would be left with not even ‘marginal influence’ in the world if it left the EU. Mr Cameron said British voters – not the head of the European Commission – were ‘the boss’, insisting reform of the right to free movement would be central to demands for a looser relationship with Brussels if he wins the next election. Scroll down for video . Strong words: David Cameron hit back at Jose Manuel Barroso (left), saying the voters were his 'boss' Senior Tories believe he will wait until after the Rochester by-election at the end of next month to set out his plans. The Daily Mail revealed last month that Cabinet ministers are examining the idea of an ‘emergency brake’ which could be applied to limit numbers if migration exceeded forecasts. Yesterday there were claims ministers also want to draw on current practice in Croatia, the latest country to join the EU. British workers wanting to live and work there for more than three months need a work permit, only issued with proof of accommodation, financial means of support, health insurance and a criminal background check. Mr Cameron said: ‘What we need in Britain is a renegotiation of our relationship with the European Union and a referendum where the British people decide whether to stay in this reformed organisation or do we leave it. Clashes: The EU chief had said proposed British curbs on migrants from the Continent would be illegal . ‘Now that’s what I will pursue, that’s what I will deliver and at the heart of that renegotiation we need to address people’s concerns about immigration. 'I’m very clear about who the boss is, about who I answer to and it is the British people. They want this, they’re not being unreasonable about it. I will fix it.’ But Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg claimed Mr Barroso was right to warn that Britain would be marginalised on the world stage if it quits the EU. He said: ‘Just ask yourself this – do you really think that people in Beijing, Washington, Tokyo are going to take Britain seriously in the future if we don’t stand tall in Brussels, Berlin and Paris? Ed Miliband has appointed one of Labour’s few remaining Blairite MPs as shadow Europe minister. In a mini reshuffle prompted by the resignation of Rushanara Ali over Labour’s support for airstrikes in Iraq, former business minister Pat McFadden was promoted. He is an arch-supporter of Tony Blair and is likely to sharpen Labour’s position on EU reform. ‘I just think bobbing around rather hopelessly in the mid-Atlantic, and having lots of major foreign investors pulling out of this country jeopardising millions of jobs…I don’t think is a way of making this country stronger and safer and more prosperous in the future.’ Mr Barroso, who steps down from his post at the end of the month, warned Britain would struggle to have even ‘marginal influence’ in the world outside the EU. It came as France unveiled proposed legislation which could mean EU migrants being refused entry if their ‘personal behaviour’ is considered a threat to ‘security or public order’. Will the options work? Analysis by JAMES SLACK . David Cameron’s immigration proposals are on hold until December. Home Affairs Editor JAMES SLACK looks at his options and whether they will work. AN 'EMERGENCY BRAKE' Controls would be imposed on EU migrants if the number of new arrivals have a ‘destabilising’ effect on the economy or public services. The measure would be strictly temporary – leaving Mr Cameron open to criticism he has not regained control of Britain’s borders. Achievable? Not impossible. There are precedents for short-term suspensions of free movement. The Open Europe think-tank says member states with high levels of immigration could support Mr Cameron to help him secure a Yes vote in an EU referendum. QUOTAS OR A LIMIT ON NI NUMBERS . Only a fixed number of EU nationals allowed in each year. One method would see a time limit placed on NI numbers – preventing people from working or claiming benefits indefinitely. This could prove a bureaucratic nightmare and it is unclear how the Home Office would be able to remove those without permission to be here. Achievable? Almost certainly not. It is illegal under existing treaties and other states would be highly unlikely to negotiate, having voted against a Swiss quota plan. Mr Cameron would have to threaten to leave the EU and hope countries such as Poland preferred some of its countrymen being guaranteed entry, rather than none if Britain quit. Making a stand: Does enough political will exist to defy Brussels over immigration laws? (file photo) A POINTS SYSTEM . EU workers would only be allowed in if their skills are needed. To appease Brussels, the threshold could be set lower for EU nationals than non-EU worker. Achievable? No. It would involve ripping up treaties and there is no appetite to even consider the idea among EU members. BENEFITS RESTRICTIONS . Mr Cameron has already tightened access to unemployment benefits. He could augment this with controls on benefits which top-up wages. This would reduce a major pull factor for families from countries such as Romania and Bulgaria, where wages are low. Achievable? Yes. Many member states share Britain’s concerns and would like to re-take control of their own benefit systems. MAKE A STAND AND DEFY BRUSSELS . Unilaterally re-impose border controls on EU nationals without bothering to first renegotiate the existing treaties. Achievable? Yes – if the political will exists. Britain would be hauled to the European Court of Justice but some Tories believe that, prior to an election, this could be hugely popular. QUIT THE EU . The Ukip position is that nothing short of full withdrawal will give back border control. Achievable? Yes, though it would require the support of the public in a referendum. Mr Cameron’s critics say that, unless he at least threatens to leave, he should expect to achieve nothing in negotiations.","PM hit back at European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso .

"Tragic: Flight Lieutenant Sean Cunningham was killed when he was ejected from an aircraft while it was on the ground at RAF Scampton . A Red Arrows pilot was killed yesterday at the stunt team’s base, just months after one of his colleagues died in a crash. Flight Lieutenant Sean Cunningham’s . plane was still on the runway when he was ejected up to 200 feet into . the air before plunging to the ground. Paramedics treated the 35-year-old before he was airlifted to hospital where he died shortly afterwards. Flt Lt Cunningham flew in the Iraq war on close air support missions for British and U.S. ground troops. The horrific incident happened less . than three months after another Red Arrows pilot, Flt Lt Jon Egging, 33, . was killed when his jet crashed at an air show in Dorset. Before Flt Lt Egging’s death in August, there had been no Red Arrows fatalities since 1988. Royal Air Force personnel said yesterday was a ‘black day’ for the world-famous aerobatics display team. Only last week Red Arrows crews joined Flt Lt Egging’s family and friends at a packed memorial service for the pilot. Elaine Findlay, of the Bournemouth Red . Arrows Association, said: ‘We haven’t got over losing Jon Egging and . now we have this dreadful news. They are such brilliant aviators, and so . loved and admired by the public.’ Military chiefs said an independent . inquiry would be launched into the tragedy which happened at RAF . Scampton in Lincolnshire. Crucial to the investigation will be whether . there were any problems with the ejection seat or if its parachute . failed to open. Last year the RAF grounded its fleet . of 126 Hawk T1 jets – used by the Red Arrows for their high-speed . formations – after faults with the seats were discovered. Paramedics were called to the team's world-famous aerobatics base in Lincolnshire yesterday morning after the incident involving one of the display team's Hawk T1 aircraft . Grounded: The planes are sealed off by investigators after yesterday's incident . Prayers: Group Captain Simon Blake said said his thoughts were with the pilot's family and friends at this difficult time . An RAF insider said: ‘If the ejection . seat is in working order then even if the plane is on the ground the . pilot should walk away.’ Earlier this year, Flt Lt Cunningham told how . he had achieved his schoolboy dream of joining the Red Arrows. Speaking to his local paper in May, he . said: ‘Being on the Red Arrows team has been my dream job and something . I have wanted to do since I can remember. I remember seeing them on the . telly and thinking I want to be able to do that.’ Flt Lt Cunningham qualified for his . private pilot’s licence when he was 17. He joined the RAF in 2000 after . studying electrical and electronic engineering at the University of . Nottingham. Concerns about the ejection seats recurred when Flt Lt Egging was killed after the Bournemouth Air Show in August. Minutes earlier his wife Dr Emma . Egging had watched the breathtaking performance. Witnesses who rushed to . the crash site in a field near the village of Throop found his body . floating in the River Stour with the ejection seat a short distance . away. Flt Lt Cunningham joined the Red Arrows last year at the same time as Flt Lt Egging. He grew up in Binley, near Coventry – 15 miles from the Warwickshire village of Ufton where Flt Lt Egging was raised. Medical teams rushed to RAF Scampton after the accident at about 11am yesterday. The Red Arrows jets could be seen . lined up on the tarmac at the team’s base last night. One aircraft had . the front part of its cockpit canopy missing. Scorch marks: The side of the plane appears blackened, suggesting marks left when the canopy was blasted off . Inquiry: Workers drape a tarpaulin across the stricken jet . Last night, an RAF official was . stationed at the family home. He said the family did not wish to comment . about the tragedy. But, fighting back tears, a neighbour paid tribute . to the pilot she described as a ‘lovely lad’. Betty Dickson, 86, said: ‘Sean’s . father came around to tell me what had happened earlier. The family are . friends of mine and they are obviously distraught. ‘Sean was happy-go-lucky – he was always interested in aircraft.’ Group Captain Simon Blake, commandant . of the RAF’s Central Flying School, said last night: ‘The pilot was . ejected from the aircraft whilst the aircraft was on the ground. ‘The director-general of the Military . Aviation Authority is in the process of initiating a full and . independent service inquiry to determine the cause of this tragic . incident.’ Tragic: The Red Arrows have flown a 'missing man' formation since the death of pilot Jon Egging in August. Flt Lt Cunningham was the second Red Arrows pilot to be killed this year.  Flt Lt Jon Egging (pictured right) died in August when his jet crashed after an air show in Bournemouth . Aviation expert Jim Ferguson said: . ‘Ejector seats are made like a Swiss watch, and many British pilots owe . their lives to them. Incidents like these are extremely rare. During my . 40 years in the aviation industry I can only remember four or five . similar incidents in Britain.’ The Red Arrows completed their final display of the season in September and are currently carrying out winter training. The display team has five new pilots who are familiarising themselves with the Hawk T1s which specialise in low-level flying. The team, formed in 1965, aim to fly . their first formation involving all nine aircraft in the team in March. Since the crash in August, the Red Arrows have been flying eight-man . formations instead of the usual nine. Each year the Red Arrows’ line-up . changes, with pilots normally flying with the team for three years, . before returning to operational duties.","Flight Lieutenant Sean Cunningham was thrown 200 feet into the air while plane was on runway before falling to ground .

"In Washington D.C. on Tuesday evening, Wilfried Zaha will step out for a 45-minute appearance that may define his future as a Manchester United player. Increasingly it appears that his time at Old Trafford is on a knife-edge. If Zaha flops and shows the same lack of interest some feel he has displayed off the field since joining last summer, the opportunity to wear the red shirt may not come again. However, against Inter Milan, Louis van Gaal will at least hand Zaha the chance to resuscitate his United career. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis van Gaal closely supervising Manchester United training . Point to prove: Wilfried Zaha must hit the ground running against Inter Milan . Double sessions: Zaha has been made to work hard during his time in America . Happy days: Zaha, pictured playing for Crystal Palace, is yet to hit it off at Old Trafford . He will play the second half and be . expected to show flashes of the considerable talent that persuaded Sir . Alex Ferguson to spend £15million to make him his final signing as . United manager. Already, though, Zaha is on the back foot. In a press conference in the early hours of Tuesday morning, Van Gaal made it clear that his new 3-5-2 system could restrict the 21-year-old’s role at the club, depriving Zaha of the freedom to play in his favoured position on the wing, where as a Crystal Palace player he dazzled with his dazzling step-overs and blistering pace. It was this creativity that persuaded Palace supporters to place a gigantic post on London’s south circular with the words ‘He’s just too good for you’. Zaha’s performances in that final season, catapulting his local team into the top-flight, will live long in the memory at Selhurst Park. At Old Trafford, though, Zaha is starting from scratch, having to prove himself all over again. Dressing down: David Moyes and Zaha did not see eye-to-eye during the Scotsman's time at United . 'He will have to play as a striker as . he can’t play the other positions in the system,’ Van Gaal said. 'Ashley . Young can play as a wing-back. Zaha cannot do that so he will be a . striker.’ At United last . season, the consensus was that Zaha simply could not get his head round . the defensive responsibilities. There was concern that he was . either unable or unwilling to further his understanding of the game. The . player felt that David Moyes would come down particularly hard on him . in training sessions, often pointing out errors that he would often . ignore when they were committed by other players. Zaha . was not only player to disagree with Moyes’ methods last season but the problem for the 21-year-old is that the manager’s views . were often shared by several others around the club. Dream partnership: Gary Neville (left) and David Beckham (right) proved to be a successful double act at United . At least one Premier League manager is . understood to have been advised to stay away from a January loan move. Nonetheless, in a season in which United slumped to . their worst finish in 24 years, it seemed bizarre that Zaha was afforded only 28 minutes - as a late . substitute against Newcastle and Aston Villa - as a Premier League . player under Moyes. Eventually, . he went to Cardiff but after a bright start, even Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, . one of the more patient characters in the game, felt compelled to drop . Zaha. One . source said only last month: ‘I’m just not sure . he gets it at United. He really needs to knuckle down now but I don’t . know if he will listen.’ Certainly, if Van Gaal perceives his defensive awareness to be weaker than that of  Young, it speaks volumes. United wingers have always expected to blend graft with invention. In . the Ferguson years, Gary Neville and Denis Irwin appreciated . the backtracking of David Beckham and Ryan Giggs. In recent times, United . have only liberated one winger from all defensive responsibilities and . that was Cristiano Ronaldo. Clear vision: Louis van Gaal doesn't believe Zaha can fit into any of the midfield positions in his system . In this new era with flying . wing-backs, the wide players become arguably the most important in the . team, offering attacking thrust and defensive assurance. It is why Van . Gaal needs Luke Shaw in prime physical shape and why he retains an . interest in Ajax’s Daley Blind. All to play for: Zaha faces the most important 45 minutes of his United career . It . is also why Antonio Valencia was handed a contract extension within . weeks of Van Gaal joining the club, underlining the Ecuadorian’s . importance to the new regime as a defensively-minded winger. Zaha, at . this moment, cannot be trusted in that role. For . now, therefore, he must attempt to claw his way into a front-line that . already boasts Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie, Danny Welbeck and Javier . Hernandez, as well as young talents Will Keane and James Wilson. It is . an unenviable task. Zaha, for all his undoubted potential, scored only . 13 goals in 126 matches in the Championship for Crystal Palace. Van Gaal . has achieved an awful lot in his esteemed career but to convert Zaha . into a prolific frontman may extend even beyond his capabilities. Van . Gaal insists Zaha is doing everything that is asked of him but it . remains striking that he is the only member of the club’s 26-man tour . squad that is yet to appear in a match in the United States. On Saturday, in the broiling heat of Denver, Zaha, along with the three other substitutes – David de Gea, Anders Lindegaard and Darren Fletcher – were put through intensive interval sprints as part of their post-match warm down. Conundrum: Louis van Gaal is trying to succeed where Moyes (right) failed and get the best out of Zaha . Drenched in sweat and heading for the showers, Van Gaal then informed the players that they would now be going to the gym for some extra conditioning. Zaha was unimpressed, although in his defence it is difficult to imagine too many players that would relish a double fitness session in such circumstances. Nonetheless, this is Van Gaal’s way and double sessions have been the order for almost every day since pre-season began in the Dutchman’s absence at the club’s Carrington training ground a few weeks ago. That much is non-negotiable, as too is Zaha’s new position. He has an opportunity at the FedEx Field – and he must not waste it.

She saw the man approach the restaurant and assumed he was going to walk in and order. When he stopped short, she asked him if he needed any help, but he apparently just stared at her intensely and gave her a 'creepy smile'. Ally, 20, was so freaked out by the incident that she walked into the back of the restaurant and to her relief the man was gone by the time she came back. She put the encounter out of her mind until later that night when a friend sent her Rodger's sinister YouTube confession, in which he describes his, 'Day of Retribution.' By that stage six people were dead and 13 injured. The moment Ally watched the footage, she immediately recognized Rodger as the man she had come face to face with that morning. Speaking to MailOnline, Ally, originally . from Atlanta Georgia, said: 'I am sure it was him. He had that same . creepy smile and the same facial expressions that the killer pulled in . the YouTube video.

Ally, originally from Atlanta Georgia, said she is sure the man was Rodger, pictured. 'He had that same creepy smile and the same facial expressions that the killer pulled in the YouTube video,' she said . Giovanni's pizza restaurant, pictured, is a popular hangout for students in Isla Vista . 'The moment I saw the video I thought, ""I know that guy,"" then when he started smiling, I thought, ""that's the guy from Giovanni's"". 'I was so freaked out by it. I couldn't sleep at all that night. I have been trying not to think about it too much, but every now and again I think, ""I am really lucky. Something terrible could have happened to me.""' 'I don't know why he was there, but he definitely didn't want to order pizza. I was alone in the restaurant, so I guess anything could have happened.' The footage was shot at around 11.19 a.m. on Friday morning. It is not yet known when Rodger's started his killing spree, brutally stabbing roommates Weihan Wang, 20, of Fremont, and Cheng Yuan Hong, 20, of San Jose and their friend George Chen, 19, also of San Jose. It could have been just hours before, or . even soon after the video was taken. What is known is that at around . 9.27 p.m. Rodgers, 22, shot and killed Katherine Cooper, 22, and . Veronika Weiss, 19 outside Alpha Phi sorority house. He then drove to IV . Deli Mart where he shot his final victim Chris Martinez.

The moment Ally watched the footage, she immediately recognized Rodger's as the man she had come face to face with that morning . Ally had no idea any of this was going to unfold when she first spotted the man approaching the shop. She said: 'I was in the back and I walked out to put something on the counter. My colleague was out on a delivery, so I was on my own. 'I saw this guy in a baseball cap walk up to the door on his phone. I assumed he was going to come in and order, so I walked behind the counter. 'But he just leant against the little wall by the patio and stared at me. He kept looking at me for a few seconds. It was really creepy. I was pretty weirded out by it, so I asked him if he wanted any help. 'That's when he gave me this really creepy smile. It scared me, so I walked in the back and by the time I came back out he had gone.' Ally's reaction to the individual can be seen on camera footage, shot on a second device inside the shop. She went on: 'I got on with my shift and . later that night I was out with my friend when we heard a car crash . down the street. We ran over to see what it was and saw the cops all . round this guy.' Ally Kubie is seen on the footage watching who she now believes was Elliot Rodger . Ally stops and looks at the man, clearly finding his behavior odd . Although Ally didn't realize it at the time, she had just witnessed the aftermath of Rodger's rampage, which culminated in a gun battle with police. After letting off rounds at officers, he crashed his black BMW and by the time he had been pulled out of the wreckage he was dead, having suffered a single gunshot wound to the head. It is believed he shot himself with one of the 400 bullets he had left in his car. Ally went on: 'I was at home later that night and my friend sent me a link to the guy's YouTube video. The moment I watched it I recognized him. It was really creepy. 'Then I found out he lived just a block away from me. I used to walk past his apartment every day. It's so horrible to think he killed those people in there. 'If I'm honest I'm trying not to think about it. After all, nothing happened and I'm OK, but sometimes I do think how lucky I am that he didn't come in and do something.' The owner of the popular restaurant Matt Meczka has watched the video dozens of times and still can't be sure if Rodger is the man who walks up to the door. He said: 'It is impossible to tell. 'The next day there was a big soccer game on and we were absolutely packed at that time. He may have got the days confused and thought that was on Friday and that the restaurant was going to be busy. That is just speculation as no one really knows.'","Waitress Ally Kubie was working in Giovanni's pizza restaurant in Isla Vista .

"Sadistic: Nicolae Patraucean, 21, has been jailed for a minimum of 25 years over the depraved murder . A 'sadistic' builder who strangled a 55-year-old woman, slit her throat and mutilated her body with a Stanley knife has been jailed for at least 25 years. Nicolae Patraucean, 21, had drunk heavily and taken cannabis, cocaine and heroin in the 24 hours before the brutal murder in Colindale, north London. The Old Bailey heard Rivka Holden was pronounced dead at her home on March 16 after a panicked caller flagged down a passing police car outside her house. Detectives discovered her red Hyundai, usually parked outside, was missing and it was later found abandoned in the nearby suburb of Kingsbury. But robbery was not thought to be the motive for the killing - as large amounts of cash were found intact in Ms Holden's flat. Instead prosecutors said Ms Holden, originally from Israel, was murdered in an act of pure sadism. Prosecutor Timothy Cray told a previous hearing: ‘We would say it’s particularly serious on the grounds of sadism'. Defence barrister David Spens QC previously insisted Patraucean, originally from Romania, did not suffer from any mental illness. He said: ‘Apart from some self-harm, there is nothing else that we are aware of and indeed the family members who know him well do not speak of any mental illness as such. ‘The problem appears to be one that involves the excessive intake of drink and drugs.’ Judge Timothy Pontius QC jailed Patraucean, from Stanmore, north London, for life today and ordered he serve at least 25 years before he can be considered for parole. The sentence came after a complex legal hearing to establish the circumstances of the killing. Sentence: Patraucean, who drank heavily before the attack, was jailed today at the Old Bailey (pictured) Detective Inspector Simon Ashwin, of the Met Police's Homicide and Major Crime Command, said: 'I hope this sentence gives Ms Holden's family some solace in knowing that her killer has been brought to justice and will spend many years in prison.' Speaking after her death, Julian Mann, of the local Kingsbury Synagogue, said: ‘She was very warm and would sometimes drop into us for a chat and something to eat. ‘My wife and I enjoyed talking to her. ‘She also chatted in Hebrew with my son, who is a Rabbi, and asked which Rabbis she could go to for a blessing for her health. ‘She had already had an operation on her foot and her walking was limited.’","Mutilated body of Rivka Holden, 55, found at her home in Colindale, London .

"There's something perversely hilarious about watching others have the pants scared off them, which is precisely what happens in the Nightmares Fear Factory. The haunted house in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada, uses actors, noises and spooky lighting - though it's almost always pitch black - in the experience that takes between 10 and 15 minutes.

In the past it's been said they've been petrified and made scream by a group of ghosts while in other cases they've been made to feel like they are in a car crash. Should it all get too much for them, patrons can use the safe word - 'nightmares' - but they will then have the indignity of being escorted out safely by staff and go onto the public 'chicken list', which has well over 100,000 members. Before going in, visitors can watch the reactions of others on screens in the lobby, but that doesn't seem to have any impact on them being scared witless once it becomes their time.

'At night he was tormented by young hooligans who taunted the eccentric old man,' the attractions' official website says. Abraham would chase the riff-raff from their pranks and dares. They always laughed at his threats, until one fateful night. 'Abraham confronted a rowdy group of thrill-seekers.

"When tensions run high in a football match, players' tempers can occasionally get the better of them. But it seems the heat of the London derby between Chelsea and Arsenal got too much for managers Arsene Wenger and Jose Mourinho, who ended up shoving each other on the Stamford Bridge touchline within the first 20 minutes. These pictures show the Frenchman approaching the Blues manager and pushing him in the chest after they disagreed over a tackle by Chelsea defender Gary Cahill on Alexis Sanchez. Scroll down for video . Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger approached Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho as he tried to remonstrate with fourth official Jon Moss during today's London derby . Fightback: Mourinho looks shocked by Wenger as decides to push back, as another member of the Chelsea coaching team rushes to intervene . Wenger's tie flaps in the wind as the two have a brief tiff during the first half of the Chelsea v Arsenal Premier League match this afternoon . Wenger pushed Mourinho square in the chest to stop him from remonstrating to fourth official Jon Moss. Mourinho, known as The Special One, then reacts, pushing back aggressively and telling Wenger to 'back off' as Wenger's tie flaps in the wind. Chelsea fans were seen cheering as Mr Moss and coaching staff stepped in to separate the pair of managers, while the players carried on unaware. Referee Martin Atkinson was then called over to have words with the two managers, who, surprisingly, were not sent to the stands over the childish tiff. The bosses did not shake hands after the match, and they may yet find themselves in hot water with the FA for the clash after Mr Atkinson submits his match report. Mourinho could find himself in further trouble for walking on to the pitch to tell the referee that his Belgian goal keeper Thibaut Courtois was injured. When asked after the match about the clash with Wenger, the Chelsea boss said: 'For me, it is over. 'But the technical area is very clear - I have mine, he has his and he cannot come to mine, especially to put pressure on the referee to give a red card to my player. 'So I just told him ""leave my technical area and don't come back please"".' When asked if it was a big deal that Wenger had put his hands on him, Mourinho said: 'No, it is no problem.' After the match, the Arsenal boss was asked whether he regretted the managers' long-running feud turning physical. He said: 'No. What is to regret after that? 'I wanted to go from A to B and somebody confronted me in between without any sign of welcome.' Intense glare: The two managers refused to back down as Mr Moss tried to separate them, much to the enjoyment of the Chelsea fans behind . It only took 20 minutes for the two managers, who have a long-running feud, to come to blows during the first half of the league clash . Football fans and celebrities on Twitter saw the funny side of the push-fight between the head coaches, including Gary Lineker, who tweeted: 'A punch-up between the 2 managers at halftime would be sensational entertainment.' He added: 'Even the 4th official is trying not to laugh.' Arsenal fan Piers Morgan tweeted: 'BOOM! Take him down, Arsene. #mourinho'. Matthew Taylor, a supporter from Chicago, said: 'I'm also having a good morning debating w/ my dad who'd win in a fight: Arsene Wenger or Jose Mourinho. I've got Wenger.' Chelsea fan Sammy Quaye tweeted: 'That Wenger - Mourinho fight must be arranged soon'. The Blues went on to win the match between the two-title contenders. Eden Hazard put Chelsea ahead in the first half from the penalty spot, with Diego Costa doubling their lead late on in the second half. Wenger and Mourinho have a long-running feud which stretches back to when the former Real Madrid manager first came to the Premier League. In footballing terms the Chelsea manager is on top, remaining unbeaten by Wenger in all competitions after 12 attempts. In the summer of 2005, the outspoken Portuguese suggested the fixture list was arranged to favour Arsenal, and within a month Wenger was questioning Chelsea’s negative tactics. Later that year Wenger said Mourinho was 'disrepectful' and 'out of touch with reality' for calling him a voyeur who was obsessed with Chelsea. In footballing terms the Chelsea manager is on top of the managers' feud, remaining unbeaten by Wenger in all competitions after 12 attempts . Final warning: Referee Martin Atkinson was then called over to have words with the two managers, who, surprisingly, were not sent to the stands over the childish tiff . In February this year, Chelsea were one point clear of Arsenal at the top of the Premier League table and the ceasefire between Wenger and Mourinho was shattered after the Arsenal manager suggested his opposite number was afraid of failure. In possibly their worst fall-out so far, Mourinho responded: ‘He’s a specialist in failure. If he is right and I am afraid of failure it is because I didn’t fail many times. Eight years without silverware, that’s failure.’ Their feud continued in in Wenger's 1000th game in March, when Mourinho's Blues side spoiled the occasion by thrashing them 6-0. This summer saw the pair clash in the transfer market as former Gunners captain Cesc Fabregas sought to return the Premier League after a spell with Barcelona. Spanish international Fabregas chose Chelsea, moving for £30million. Mourinho insisted that returning to the Emirates was ‘not an option’ because the Spaniard ‘really wanted to come to Chelsea’. Wenger responded: ‘People came out and said he wanted to go to Chelsea but I don’t know who tells the truth here or not.’","Arsene Wenger pushed Jose Mourinho in the first 20 minutes of the Chelsea v Arsenal Premier League clash .

"A mysterious vampire slaying kit - complete with holy water, a mallet and a set of wooden stakes - is going on show in a new exhibition dedicated to the strange and supernatural world of the gothic. The ghoulish box, which also includes a crucifix, rosary beads and a pistol, is part of a new exhibition at the British Library in central London which opens tomorrow. Some believe the kits date back to Victorian times, with others saying they are more modern - and inspired by the famous Hammer Horror films. Experts say anti-vampire kit is Victorian but some more modern and inspired by famous Hammer Horror films . Dracula looms over the anti-Vampire weaponry on show in the gothic exhibition in the British Library, in London . Curator Greg Buzwell said: 'They really do exist and we're very fortunate and lucky to have this. 'Every component you see in there dates from the Victorian era so you've got the mallet, the stakes, the crucifix and the holy water, etc. 'But there is a mystery around them. There is no real evidence of them existing prior to about 1970.' Mr Buzwell said he could only speculate as to how many were made and for whom. 'There are 60 or 70 of them thought to be in existence. We think probably a lot of them were maybe made for eccentric collectors. Wallace and Gromit Were-Rabbit also on display in the Terror and Wonder: The Gothic Imagination exhibition . 'Others maybe were made on the back of the Hammer film adaptations and the renewed popularity of the vampire story but one or two of them may actually be genuine survivals from the Victorian era.' Other exhibits include Dracula author Bram Stoker's manuscript of his adaptation of his vampire novel for the stage and a letter said to have been written by Jack the Ripper. The document, known as the Dear Boss letter, was sent to a journalist in 1888 and written in red ink. It included details of the infamous serial killer's attacks and experts have long debated whether it is a hoax or not.

Also on show are gothic-inspired fashion by Alexander McQueen and a series of pictures by photographer Martin Parr taken during the regular gathering of goths in Whitby, in north Yorkshire, where key scenes from Stoker's novel are set. The exhibition's lead curator Tim Pye said: 'Gothic is one of the most popular and influential modes of literature and I'm delighted that Terror and Wonder is celebrating its rich 250 year history. 'The exhibition features an amazingly wide range of material, from stunningly beautiful medieval artefacts to vinyl records from the early goth music scene, so there is truly something for everyone'.

"A London hospital was totally unprepared when a suspected Ebola patient walked into A&E, it was claimed today. Health authorities have carried out high-profile drills in a bid to show that Britain is ready for the feared arrival of the disease. But an insider at Lewisham hospital said the response when a potential case walked into  casualty on Saturday night shows the reality of the situation is much worse. Scroll down for video . A man walked into Lewisham hospital  with suspected Ebola on Saturday night and was put into isolation - but an insider says he was allowed to use a communal toilet and even received visitors . The incident came on the same day as the NHS carried out a training drill on how to deal with the outbreak (pictured at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary) It was reported today that a man arrived at the hospital fearing he had the deadly virus after travelling to Britain from Sierra Leone two weeks ago. But a source told The Sun some staff refused to go near the man, who was reportedly allowed visitors and used a communal toilet. The insider said: 'The hospital is unprepared. Staff are panicking and scared for their safety.' The man - who was later found not to have the virus - was not transferred to the specialist Royal Free Hospital, which is the only hospital in Britain equipped with a fully 'ebola-proof' isolation unit. The source claimed hospital staff only have 'aprons, masks and flimsy surgical gloves' rather than the bio-protection suits used in the drill. Reports of the incident contrast with the well-organised response shown in a training exercise carried out on the same day. In the NHS drill, an actor feigned collapse at a shopping centre in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, after telling passers-by he was not feeling well. He was taken to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle by an ambulance crew equipped to deal with an Ebola case, where he was put into an isolation unit. An actor used as a patient in the drill in Newcastle (pictured) was transferred to the specialist Royal Free Hospital in London - but a source in Lewisham said this did not happen in a suspected case on Saturday . Staff in Hillingdon hospital in Uxbridge, west London taking part in the national Ebola exercise. Staff in Lewisham have reportedly been left with only masks, aprons and gloves to deal with the disease . Lewisham hospital - which has found the man does not have Ebola - say worried staff are being supported . The 'victim' was then transferred 300 miles to the Royal Free Hospital in north London, as planned. The exercises were announced days in advance – but the Department of Health has said 'key people' at the hospitals involved had been given only a few hours' notice that they would take part. A spokesman for Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust said: 'It's important to stress that we did follow robust and established systems that are in place to manage and care for people with suspected infectious diseases. 'Following a clinical assessment and advice from the Imported Fever Service Unit, the patient was identified as ""low risk"" for Ebola. They were always treated in isolation and all staff wore appropriate protective clothing. 'As a low risk patient, they were allowed to see a visitor under controlled conditions, meaning the visitor was given protective clothing for the duration of the visit. Tests have confirmed that the patient does not have the Ebola virus. 'We understand that cases like this can be alarming for staff, and it's unfortunate someone has raised concerns publicly when the Trust did follow best practice guidelines. 'We will be speaking to staff to remind them of our protocols and procedures for infection control and to encourage them to let us know if they need any additional support.' British nurse Will Pooley was the first Briton to contract the disease but was successfully treated in the UK . He was flown back to the High Secure Infectious Disease Unit at The Royal Free Hospital (pictured) in August . The Ebola outbreak is thought to have started in Guinea in December last year and deaths from the virus rose rapidly in West Africa this summer and now top 4,000. The World Health Organization today called the Ebola outbreak 'the most severe, acute health emergency seen in modern times'. It added that economic disruption can be curbed if people are educated so they don't make any irrational moves to dodge infection. WHO Director-General Margaret Chan, citing World Bank figures, said 90 per cent of economic costs of any outbreak 'come from irrational and disorganised efforts of the public to avoid infection.' World Health Organisation director-general Margaret Chan said the Ebola outbreak has proved 'the world is ill-prepared to respond to any severe, sustained, and threatening public health emergency'. In a statement to a regional health conference in the Philippines, she said: 'I have never seen a health event threaten the very survival of societies and governments in already very poor countries. 'I have never seen an infectious disease contribute so strongly to potential state failure.' 'We are seeing, right now, how this virus can disrupt economies and societies around the world,' she said, but added that adequately educating the public was a 'good defense strategy' and would allow governments to prevent economic disruptions. British nurse Will Pooley became the first Briton to contract the virus after working as a volunteer in Sierra Leone, one of the worst-hit countries. Mr Pooley was flown back to Britain on August 24 and recovered after being treated in an isolation unit at the Royal Free Hospital. London mayor Boris Johnson has admitted that he expects Ebola to come to Britain soon and says he fears the disease will probably hit the capital first. 'I have little doubt that eventually there will be a case of Ebola in this country and probably in this city,' he said, adding that it was impossible to blood test everybody coming into the country. Thomas Eric Duncan became the first person to die of Ebola in the United States last week. The 42-year-old Liberian's body was incinerated alongside items that were feared contaminated by the virus in Texas on Friday. Since Mr Duncan's death, it has emerged that a female nurse who treated him has become the second person in the country to test positive for the virus. British man Colin Jaffray was suspected of being the first UK citizen to be killed by Ebola after he died on a business trip to Macedonia last week. But health officials in the eastern European country have since said the 58-year-old, from Royston, Hertfordshire, did not have the disease. Ebola has killed 4,000 people in western Africa this year, with burial teams in Liberia struggling to cope . Teams of volunteers have been picking up the bodies of victims in Liberian capital, Freetown, and officials expect the disease will move to Britain in the future .","Source claims Lewisham hospital response to case was 'farcical'

"National Police Lead for Counter Terrorism, Mark Rowley (pictured), has revealed several murderous terror plots have been foiled this year . Britain has foiled several murderous terror plots this year while counter-terrorism chiefs are grappling with 'exceptionally high' numbers of investigations, it has been revealed. The scale of the deadly threat police are facing has been laid bare by Scotland Yard Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley amid heightened fears over the influence of extremist group Islamic State. The National Police Lead for Counter Terrorism revealed details of how hundreds of suspected terrorists have been arrested so far this year. Officers are also taking down more than a thousand pieces of extremist material from the internet per week, including videos of beheadings, torture and suicides. It came as Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond suggested British jihadists who go to fight in Iraq or Syria could be tried for treason. Mr Rowley said: 'So far this year we have made 218 arrests and are running exceptionally high numbers of counter-terrorism investigations, the likes of which we have not seen for several years. 'Against an increasing operational tempo we are disrupting several attack plots a year. 'These plots are of varied sophistication, from individuals planning to carry out spontaneous yet deadly attacks to more complex conspiracies, almost all seemingly are either directed by or inspired by terrorism overseas. 'We have secured evidence and charged 16 returnees for terrorist activity in Syria. 'The volume, range and pace of counter-terrorism activity has undergone a step change. 'Public safety is our number one priority and we will always focus our disruption activity against those posing the greatest and most imminent threat. 'Sometimes this means intervening very early - essential to prevent attacks, but presenting enormous challenges in securing sufficient evidence to charge.' More than 80 per cent of the material removed from the internet is related to Iraq and Syria, and Mr Rowley revealed that so far there are 66 people who have been reported missing to police who are feared to have travelled to Syria. The scale of the deadly threat police are facing has been revealed amid heightened fears over the impact of extremist group Islamic State (pictured) Mr Rowley revealed that so far there are 66 people who have been reported missing to police who are feared to have travelled to war-torn Syria. Smoke rises following an air strike by the US-led coalition in Kobane, Syria . He added: 'The growing problem of young, impressionable, and in some cases vulnerable, individuals being radicalised online is an increasing risk. 'Extremist groups are using social media in highly sophisticated ways in order to recruit or persuade individuals towards their violent and warped ideologies. 'Dozens of families have contacted us concerned about loved ones or information when they believe someone is travelling abroad. 'It is only through courageous action like that that we can help and we have been supporting such families in every way we can.' Mark Rowley, the Assistant Commissioner at Scotland Yard (pictured) revealed details of how hundreds of suspected terrorists have been arrested so far this year . Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond suggested British jihadists who go to fight in Iraq or Syria could be tried for treason . Three men and three women were detained following raids at four addresses in Portsmouth (pictured) and Farnborough in Hampshire, and Greenwich, south east London earlier this week . The senior officer's comments came after Scotland Yard made a series of arrests over an alleged 'significant' plot cooked up by suspects including at least one man who was believed to have travelled to Syria. Another series of swoops by counter-terrorism teams in the South East saw three men and three women arrested following raids at four addresses in Portsmouth and Farnborough in Hampshire, and Greenwich, south east London. There were also much publicised appeals to try to find missing teenagers Samya Dirie, 17, and Yusra Hussien, 15, who vanished last month and are thought to have travelled to the war-torn state. Meanwhile, Mr Hammond said Britons travelling to the Middle East had 'sworn personal allegiance' to Islamic State (IS) and could potentially have committed treason. The last prosecution for treason was in 1946, when the notorious Lord Haw Haw - real name William Joyce - was hanged for his Nazi propaganda broadcasts. The offence remains on the statute books, even though the death penalty has been abolished.","Hundreds of terror suspects arrested this year, police chief has revealed .

"Lord Prescott eventually revealed that food was actually a problem for him . John Prescott gained fame for his two Jaguars, his ready fists - and his love of food. But it only emerged yesterday that the roly-poly Labour politician’s fascination with eating appears to have had a long-term legacy for the Government. Astonishingly, when the now Lord Prescott was Deputy Prime Minister, his department signed a contract specifying that vending machines in his official buildings must contain ‘top selling brands’ of chocolate. The revelation was made in the House of Commons yesterday in response to a question about the standard of food sold inside Lord Prescott’s former department. Communities Minister Brandon Lewis said that the Deputy Prime Minister’s office signed a facilities management contract in 2004 with the specific request for leading chocolate brands, which coalition Government ministers regard as ‘over-specification’. Mr Lewis’s response was included in a reply to a written parliamentary question which questioned how many vending machines in the Department for Communities and Local Government’s (DCLG) offices - which came under Lord Prescott’s remit - contain snack food. Lord Prescott was Deputy Prime Minister between 1997 and 2007. Mr Lewis, commenting on vending machines, wrote: ‘We don’t intend to adopt a nanny state approach by removing them. Our catering supplier provides healthy eating options in our canteen, including fresh and seasonal produce. This Government believes in choice in public services. When Lord Prescott was Deputy Prime Minister, his department signed a contract specifying that vending machines in his official buildings must contain 'top selling brands' of chocolate . There is one vending machine in each of DCLG's core offices in Victoria and Bristol, which serve confectionery and snacks. ‘I would observe that the Office of the . Deputy Prime Minister signed a facilities management contract in 2004 . which required that there ‘must be top-selling brands’ of chocolate in . the vending machine for the First Secretary of State. ‘Ministers in this administration would regard that as over-specification.’ Mr Lewis confirmed there is one vending machine in each of DCLG’s core offices in Victoria and Bristol, which serve confectionery and snacks. He was replying to a question from Labour MP Debbie Abrahams (Oldham East and Saddleworth). She asked had asked Communities Secretary Eric Pickles: ‘How many vending machines in your department’s premises contain snack food that are high in calories and low in nutritional value?’ Well-nourished Pickles has himself recently joked about his own eating habits, posing for a Twitter photograph next to an ironically healthy snack of salad and carrot sticks. But Lord Prescott, while famous for his love of fattening Chinese food, eventually revealed that food was actually a problem for him. He revealed in 2008 that he had become bulimic, gorging huge meals then making himself sick so he could keep on eating. And chocolate bars were part of his unhealthy diet that took him to 16 stone. Lord Prescott said: ‘What I did was stuff my face with anything around, any old rubbish - burgers, chocolate, crisps, fish and chips, loads of it, till I felt sick. But at least I’d had the pleasure of stuffing my face and feeling really full.’ He would wash down his binge meals with an entire can of condensed milk - and even went to McDonalds for a Big Mac after wolfing down a huge state banquet.","Revelation made in the House of Commons in response to a question about the standard of food sold inside Lord Prescott's former department .

"A US Airways flight from New York safely made an emergency landing Saturday evening at its destination in Charlotte after oxygen masks deployed in the final minutes amid indications of a pressurization issue, a spokesman said, adding one of its regional flights also made a safe emergency landing in Charlotte soon afterward. US Airways spokesman Matt Miller told The Associated Press by telephone that none of the 146 passengers and five crew aboard US Airways flight 745 from LaGuardia airport in New York was hurt. He said the crew of the Airbus A320 was already below cruising altitude and 'well into' its descent into Charlotte Douglas International Airport when the issue arose before 7 p.m. Saturday. 'The masks were deployed. I don't know how many passengers used them,' Miller said, adding a handful of passengers requested medical checks at the gate as a precaution upon arrival. Television personality Danny Lipford was on board the flight from LaGuardia to Charlotte and was able to take video of oxygen masks dropping from the ceiling and of passengers doing their best to remain calm and follow the safety protocol.

"Alex Salmond said the poll tax was dead so outstanding debts should be written off . Alex Salmond yesterday wrote off more than £400million in unpaid poll tax payments in a final act of ‘financial irresponsibility’. The First Minister’s ‘tax-dodger’s charter’ stunned local authority chiefs, who want to chase up the debts and spend the cash on vital services. Critics fear the amnesty is a cynical bid to appease pro-independence voters who risk being caught by the authorities after registering to vote for the first time in the referendum. With an additional £1billion outstanding in council tax payments, Mr Salmond’s shock decision – one of the last before he resigns next month - could create a precedent that would leave public finances in chaos. It will also infuriate law-abiding Scots who paid their poll tax payments, despite the policy’s widespread unpopularity. At a baffling briefing session with journalists yesterday afternoon, Mr Salmond’s spokesman said Margaret Thatcher’s community charge – as it was officially known – was ‘dead’ so the debts should now be ignored. He argued that sums recouped in recent years have fallen to just £400,000, but council chiefs wanted to improve on that by combing the new electoral roll to catch those who had dropped off the radar. The historic vote on Scotland's future saw a surge in registrations, with 120,000 in the final six weeks alone, as people formed unprecedented queues outside town halls. According to the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (CoSLA), Scots still owe £425million in unpaid poll tax bills. The Scottish Daily Mail understands that councils may be handed a small one-off £350,000 compensation sum – less than 0.1 per cent of the outstanding total. The organisation’s furious president, David O’Neill, said: ‘Whatever you think of the substantive issue… this is one of the oddest decisions ever to have come out of the Scottish Government. ‘Just look at the hard facts. Up until two days ago the policy of local government, fully backed up by Audit Scotland reports and the Scottish Government, was crystal clear: Scotland’s councils were under a very strict obligation to collect every penny of outstanding debt owed to us. ‘Indeed, we have been told in the past that until we did this, we should not be asking for any additional money from Government. ‘It seems very odd that now we have an improved tool at our disposal in the form of an expanded electoral register that may help us maximise collection rates, it is the self-same government that tells us they are going to legislate immediately to prevent us from using it.’ He accused the government of ‘rushing with obscene haste to new legislation’, adding: ‘CoSLA is very sensitive to the requirement to increase political engagement and electoral registration but everybody recognises that becoming involved in the political process demands responsibility as well as rights. ‘In CoSLA’s view, you cannot have one without the other. If that is not an accepted principle, we are very worried about the precedent that writing off this debt would create.’ The ‘community charge’ was introduced a year early north of the Border, sparking widespread opposition and an organised campaign of non-payment in 1989. Around 700,000 summary warrants for non-payment were issued after the first year, but Margaret Thatcher refused to change course and the tax was introduced in England in 1990. Disgraced former MSP Tommy Sheridan was the first person in Britain to be jailed over the tax, while a series of protests brought about the policy’s end in 1993. Margaret Thatcher's poll tax sparked protests across Scotland - including this 1990 march in Glasgow . Mr Salmond said yesterday: ‘The poll tax was a hated levy, which poured untold misery on communities across Scotland. ‘It was a hugely discredited tax, even before it was brought in – and it was rightly consigned to history just four years after its introduction in Scotland. ‘It is therefore not appropriate for councils to use current electoral records to chase arrears from decades ago.’ He added: ‘It is, of course, quite proper for councils to use current information to assess current council tax liability. Unlike the long dead, discredited poll tax, the council tax is a live levy which forms a key part of local authorities’ finances.’ His spokesman was asked what will happen to outstanding council tax payments if the tax is abolished under SNP proposals for a ‘local income tax’. Struggling to answer, he said there will be a consultation on the suggested local income tax. Scottish Conservative welfare reform spokesman Alex Johnstone said: ‘This can only count as a write-off if all councils are fully reimbursed for the money they have not yet received. ‘There is many a person in Scotland who paid this tax in good faith, and they have ended up subsidising those who can afford to pay but chose not to. Are those hardworking people going to be reimbursed too under this initiative? ‘If this is the Scottish Government’s approach on tax collection, why should anyone bother paying any tax at all? ‘This is a move geared towards winning a few extra votes, and is nothing but a tax-dodger’s charter and a final act of financial irresponsibility from Alex Salmond.’","Mr Salmond wrote off more than £400million in unpaid poll tax payments .

"Whether you kick back with a glass of wine, immerse yourself in a novel or strike up a conversation with the person seated next to you on a plane can be determined by which nationality is listed on your passport, a survey has claimed. According to the results of an international passenger investigation, Australians are the biggest boozers on board with 36 per cent choosing to down the hatch, compared to 35 per cent of Americans and 33 per cent of Brits. The Airline Passenger Experience Association (APEX) spoke to around 1,500 people, ages 18 and older, who have travelled by plane at least once during the last three months and were living in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, China, Singapore, Australia or Brazil.

They are also the first to reach for their credit card for some in-flight shopping and the biggest fans of gaming. • Thirty-eight percent of respondents listed comfortable seating as the top priority for improvements . • Twenty-nine percent of male respondents said they want quieter cabins . • Twenty-six percent of women respondents prioritised upgraded lavatories . • Women are 30 percent more likely than men to pay to check extra bags, even if overhead luggage space is no concern . • Sixty-two percent of passengers bought food prior to boarding, even if 70 percent are satisfied with in-flight food . • Being on time is the biggest concern for passengers on the ground prior to the flight, followed by seat selection and legroom . • Passengers under 34 are the most active in social connectivity, but travellers between 35 and 54 also are highly active online – with 43 percent who said they engaged in in-flight social connectivity at least once in a three-month span of flying . Americans on the other hand like to use their time in the air more productively – when not drinking - opting to work while flying at 35,000 feet. Meanwhile, Brits and Germans are the best at making chit chat with random strangers – spending 50 per cent more time than any other nationalities schmoozing. Contrastingly, Brazilians conduct their conversations online via email, messaging apps or social media. Despite plane food having a bad reputation, seven out of 10 respondents said they were happy to chow down on the selection of in-flight snacks and meals. In-flight magazines were also popular with four out of five passengers claiming to read them. The international flyers, who travelled on eight major airlines, did however express their desire for better in-flight entertainment and 36 per cent wanted improved connectivity. ‘The industry has greatly improved the comfort, ambience, connectivity and entertainment onboard aircraft, and this data underscores that passengers are embracing those improvements,’ said Russell Lemieux, APEX executive director. ‘At the same time, passengers are demanding more from their air travel experiences which will drive more innovations touching all aspects of the journey,’ he added.

"She's famous for her love of horses and skiing but it seems Sophie Wessex isn't quite so adept when it comes to bows and arrows. During a visit to a Buckinghamshire rehabilitation centre, she tried her hand at wheelchair archery - but managed to miss every time. With barely any shots on target, the Countess was left chuckling ruefully as the top scoring servicemen and women being treated at the centre looked on. Scroll down for video . Letting fly: Sophie tried her hand at wheelchair archery for the first time during a visit to Stoke Mandeville . The Countess of Wessex was completing a tour of Stoke Mandeville Stadium in Buckinghamshire when she made her ill-fated foray into archery. Stoke Mandeville is  the birthplace of British Paralympic sport, with the rehabilitation centre launched by neurologist Sir Ludwig Guttmann in 1943. Guttman, who arrived in Britain as a penniless Jewish refugee fleeing Nazi Germany, was convinced that sport was key to recovery and his championing of wheelchair sports not only reaped dividends for patient care, it also led to the creation of the Paralympic Games. The stadium, which was built on the site of Guttman's original treatment centre, was opened by the Prince of Wales in 2003 and has since been visited by all senior members of the royal family. Sophie herself was there to launch the stadium's Hall of Fame, which recognises those who have made an 'extraordinary contribution' to British wheelchair sport. Chocks away! Sophie lets fly with an arrow but things don't go quite as she had hoped... Missed it! The royal claps her hand to her mouth in dismay before offering watchers a rueful smile . A long standing supporter of charities dedicated to disability, along with WheelPower, which runs Stoke Mandeville Stadium, she is also patron of Brainwave, which funds therapy for youngsters with physical difficulties, the Disability Initiative and Dyslexia Action. Speaking about the visit, WheelPower chairman Kevin Baker said: 'We are delighted to welcome the Countess of Wessex to this special occasion at Stoke Mandeville Stadium. 'The Hall of Fame is an honour exclusively reserved for the top contributors to British wheelchair sport both past and present. 'The current names on the board have not only made remarkable achievements on a personal level, they have inspired and facilitated disabled people all over the country to take up sport. Cuddle: Last week saw her cuddle up to three-month-old Rowan Wilson Jones during a visit to Peterborough . Cheers: Sophie also travelled to RAF Wittering where she was met by children from a local primary school . 'The latest additions to the Hall of Fame are all individuals that have dedicated much of their lives to wheelchair sport and their contribution has been invaluable and their names have become synomonous with Stoke Mandeville Stadium and the birthplace of the Paralympic movement.' Sophie's visit to Stoke Mandeville has come at the end of a busy month of engagements, including one in Margate that saw her delight a wheelchair-bound boy when she gave him a hug. She also joined in the fun at a musical playgroup in Peterborough and spent much of the visit playing with a group of excited toddlers. More is to come, with the Countess scheduled to attend receptions on behalf of the London Press Club and Great Ormond Street Hospital tomorrow, followed by trips to Staffordshire and Birmingham. Her husband, Prince Edward, also has plenty in his diary, starting with trips to Warwickshire and Surrey tomorrow and Friday. Clearly still revelling in the extraordinary success of the first ever Invictus Games, Prince Harry paid tribute to the men and women who took part at the Pride of Britain Awards last night. In a speech recorded for the show, he said 'to fight for your country takes courage but to move beyond life changing injuries takes an extraordinary level of grit and determination' before speaking of his admiration for those who managed it. The 30-year-old continued: 'I can only begin to imagine how challenging the journey to recovery is but the admiration I have for these men and women is limitless. 'Using the power of sport to enhance recovery, the Invictus Games showed how those who have been wounded should be recognised for their achievements post injury, rather than by being defined for their limitations post-injury. 'The Invictus Games shone a spotlight on the unconquerable spirit of servicemen and women and their families. 'Their stories move, inspire and humble me. They are as amazing as they are unique and I'm absolutely delighted that the team is recieving this Pride of Britain award.'","Sophie Wessex tried her hand at wheelchair archery during a visit .

"Taking a break: Jenny Winder has been branded a 'hypocrite' for arranging a holiday in term time . A head teacher has been branded a ‘hypocrite’ for arranging to take a holiday abroad in term-time when parents would be fined for doing the same. Jenny Winder, 53, is due to fly to the Caribbean for a week in January, shortly after the Christmas holiday has ended. The trip is understood to have been nodded through by the chairman of governors at Elstow School, near Bedford, and was not officially announced. Earlier this week figures showed a crackdown on pupils’ term-time holidays had caused attendance to soar. Families face a £60 fine per parent per child for unauthorised absence. The school, judged ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted in 2009, reminds parents on its website to book breaks ‘only in holiday time’ and encourages pupils to achieve ‘highest possible levels of attendance’. One mother, who asked not to be named, said: ‘It is disgraceful. [Mrs Winder] is a hypocrite. We can’t take holidays in term-time so why should she? The school is fast enough threatening parents with fines if they take their children out.’ A father added: ‘It is one rule for one and one for another. She shouldn’t have been allowed to go … Teachers’ holidays are long enough … this is arrogant.’ Families are only allowed to take children out of school in ‘exceptional circumstances’ under measures brought in by the last education secretary, Michael Gove. Previously, heads had the discretion to allow pupils up to ten days’ leave each year. Parents wanted the flexibility of term-time holidays to avoid the punishing premiums holiday firms add in peak periods. Now they face a £60 fine each for every child who fails to attend school without permission – meaning a two-parent two-child family would be charged £240. Those who refuse to pay can be prosecuted, jailed for up to three months and fined £2,500. Mrs Winder has been in charge of mixed primary Elstow School for nearly 15 years and is paid around £45,000 a year. On her Friends Reunited page, she describes herself as a former PE teacher now ‘too old, fat and unfit’ to teach the subject so has become a head instead. Caribbean: The head is likely to enjoy a week of sunny weather where average daytime temperatures of 28C . The mother-of-one, who is separated from her son’s father, is understood to be travelling to the Caribbean, where average daytime temperatures in January are around 28C, with her partner. Her leave was granted by chairman of governors Kevin Hunter in June, an insider told a local newspaper, saying: ‘Mr Hunter told the governors he … had agreed it and that they had to pass it … Three governors have since resigned, stating other reasons … the chairman now needs to take responsibility and resign himself.’ Mr Hunter said Mrs Winder was ‘devoted, well-liked, extremely hard-working and effective’, adding: ‘She made a request for a week off during term-time for personal reasons which we have judged to be appropriate.’ A Bedford council spokesman said ‘individual requests for leave are a matter for schools themselves to determine’. Mrs Winder refused to comment.","Jenny Winder, 53, is due to fly in January after Christmas holiday ends .

"A new batch of emails released by the Clinton Library has revealed a White House official ridiculously suggested citing an old Jewish law as an excuse for the Monica Lewinsky affair. According to The New York Post, a senior aide to then-first lady Hillary Clinton forwarded a Talmudic definition that stated Bill Clinton had not officially cheated on his wife. Lewinsky alleged that she had nine sexual encounters with the President between 1995 and 1997. 'According to classical Jewish law, President Clinton did not commit adultery; adultery is defined as a married man having intercourse with a married woman, and Monica Lewinsky is single,' the email said. Outlandish: An Lewinsky affair-era email released from the Clinton library in Arkansas on Friday details a Talmudic interpretation of the word 'adultery' as 'a married man having intercourse with a married woman' Excuse: The email, which was forwarded by a senior White House official, suggests to use the Jewish definition as an excuse for the years-long affair between President Bill . Damage control: US First Lady Hillary Clinton delivers a speech promoting education right after news broke of the then-President's alleged affair with an intern in 1998 . 'At worst, President Clinton is guilty of the common sin of onanism [masturbation], a sin that probably afflicts the consciences of most Jewish men at one time or another.' The email was sent on January 27, 1999. News of the Clinton-Lewinsky affair broke in January 1998. Semantics played a big part in Clinton's denials at the time. He originally said: 'There is not a sexual relationship, an improper sexual relationship or any other kind of improper relationship.' After he was exposed, Clinton famously argued his lie would 'depends on what the meaning of the word ''is'' is'. He was trying to say he was not involved with Lewinsky at the time he made the statement. Close encounter: A famous photograph showing former White House intern Monica Lewinsky meeting President Bill Clinton at a White House function . The Talmudic excuse was thought up by Susannah Heschel, a professor of Jewish studies at Dartmouth, The Post reported. It was sent to Hillary Clinton's domestic-policy adviser, Ruby Shamir, and eventually ended up White House adviser and damage control expert, Sidney Blumenthal. Blumenthal must have decided not to use it. The email was one of about 10,000 documents released on Friday by the Clinton presidential library in Little Rock, Arkansas. It is the final release of files from Bill Clinton's administration. Still together:  A 1992 photo shows then-Governor of Arkansas Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary Clinton . In a different email it was revealed senior officials got rid of Lewinsky, an intern, in 1996 as her affair with the president heated up, shuffling her off to the Pentagon in a move that ultimately backfired. By 1996 West Wing staffers had started to refer to Lewinsky as 'the stalker' since she was around the Oval Office more than any intern would normally be. Top administration officials were instructed to find her a federal government job outside the White House, according to a document made public Friday by the Clinton Presidential Library. Lewinsky would get her transfer, meeting civil servant Linda Tripp at the Defense Department and launching the friendship that would lead to recorded phone calls, leaks, and a presidential impeachment.","About 10,000 records released by the Clinton library in Arkansas on Friday .

"The grieving father of murdered schoolgirl Sarah Payne was tormented by the killer of Milly Dowler after befriending him at their local pub at the height of his killing spree, it has been reported. Unsuspecting Michael Payne, who died last week aged 45 after struggling with alcoholism, became a neighbour of serial killer Levi Bellfield, who murdered Milly, as well as Marsha McDonnell and Amelie Delagrange.

It is thought that Mr Payne only found out the truth about his drinking partner when police taped off Bellfield's flat and arrested him in 2004, leaving him devastated that the man he befriended was a killer. The Sun on Sunday also reports that when police searched Bellfield's flat, they found a stash a newspaper cuttings about Sarah's murder. Mr Payne's brother, Keith 53, told the newspaper: 'It is sick what he did. I am sure Bellfield knew exactly who Mike was and targeted him. 'Why I don't know. What can you say? Evil - that's all. 'Bellfield claimed he was friends with the Paynes and boasted about it. Everybody was devastated as he wasn't friends with us at all. Michael and Sara were shocked. It was disgusting. He was trying to grab attention.' Mr Payne, pictured left with former wife Sara in 2001, moved to Walton-on-Thames following their split . Heartbreak: Ms Wright said Bellfield befriended her son in the Ashley Park pub in Walton-on-Thames in Surrey and targeted him during weekly drinking sessions . Mr Payne moved to Walton-on-Thames following his split from Sarah's mother Sara, and lived near the railway station where Milly was last seen in 2002. Bellfield was told in 2011 that he would die behind bars for the murder of the 13-year-old in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, nine years earlier. He was already serving a whole life term handed down in 2008 for the murders of Amelie Delagrange, 22, and 19-year-old Marsha McDonnell. Last week Mr Payne died alone in his armchair after being driven to drink and despair by the death of his daughter. It is thought he struggled to cope after the abduction of his eight-year-old daughter in July 2000, and was found dead at home in Maidstone, Kent, by police on Monday. His brother Alan, 47, believes 'he was in a downward spiral since it all happened with Sarah' and their father Terrance, 72, says his son was tortured by 'the fact he wasn't there to protect her'. Michael's schoolgirl daughter was snatched by paedophile Roy Whiting from a field near her grandparents' home in West Sussex, where she was playing with older brothers Luke and Lee and younger sister Charlotte. Paedophile Roy Whiting, who snatched Sarah from near her grandparents home and murdered her . Mr Payne spoke of his battle with depression in the aftermath of the ordeal, when he suffered recurring nightmares and used alcohol to cope with her death. He and wife Sara ended their 18-year marriage three years after the disappearance and both blamed the 'overwhelming' strains of coping with their tragic loss. Michael's father Terrance said: 'He turned to drink because of what happened, for the fact he wasn't there to protect her. 'After the incident we all went downhill a bit, but we managed to pull ourselves together whereas Michael really struggled. We all knew Mike had demons but it's sad it has come to this. He added: 'I hadn't spoken to him since the last Friday of September. I had agreed to speak to him the next week but there was no answer. 'I kept calling and leaving answerphone messages but never heard anything. 'Eventually the phone was cut off, so we knew something was wrong and we called the police. 'The police broke their way into his flat, and found him sitting there in his chair. We don't know exactly what he died of, but we think it was drink-related'. Sarah's mother, Sara, 45, went on to campaign for a change in legislation to allow parents to know if convicted child sex offenders live nearby, known as Sarah's Law. She has been awarded an MBE and an honorary doctorate for her work and told recently how it had given her 'much-needed focus' amid the grief and her severe post-traumatic stress disorder.

"Father-to-be Brendan Megraw, from Twinbrook, west Belfast disappeared in 1978 aged 23 . A brother of a man abducted, murdered and secretly buried by the IRA has said he hopes the discovery of a body on a remote bog in the Irish Republic will end his family's feelings of helplessness. Remains believed to be those of newly-wed Brendan Megraw, from Twinbrook, west Belfast - one of 17 murder victims who became known as the Disappeared - were discovered in a drainage ditch in the middle of Oristown bog, County Meath. The find was made by contractors as they prepared the site for forensic excavations following new information on the suspected location of the body. Kieran, one of Brendan's brothers, said he was shocked to get a phone call from investigators at about 10am today. 'For our own family it was not until 1999 that we knew Brendan was dead and buried in Oristown. There will always be questions, but if this is Brendan and we get him home, that is the target,' he said. 'The target was to get Brendan's body back. If he was killed at the spot in Oristown he was all alone, and you think he would have thought he would never be back home - that's the thought most people would not want to happen to them, being alone. 'There was always a massive frustration when you felt that he was there and you couldn't find him and couldn't bring him home - that's now gone, we hope.' Brendan Megraw was looking forward to the birth of his first child and was due to start a new job on a ship when he went missing in April 1978 aged 23. The IRA claimed the father-to-be confessed to being a British provocateur and Military Reaction Force undercover agent. Brendan Megraw's wife was expecting their first baby when her husband disappeared in Belfast . Grisly find: The area where contractors found the remains of a body in Oristown bog, County Meath . His disappearance was confirmed 15 years ago to investigators from the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains (ICLVR) - set up by the British and Irish Governments to liaise with former paramilitaries to find the Disappeared. It confirmed a body was recovered at Oristown. The ICLVR was established in 1999 after the Good Friday peace agreement and is acknowledged as a world leader in the search and recovery of human remains, with most sites being bogland. Ireland's state pathologist Professor Marie Cassidy examined the scene at Oristown along with the forensic investigators from the commission before the remains were removed. It is understood full excavations had not begun and only clearance and preparation works were taking place when the discovery was made. Grief: Kieran Megraw, the brother of missing Brendan, said he hopes the finding of a body will end his family's feelings of 'helplessness' A post mortem and formal identification, possibly through DNA, will be carried out. When contacted by the investigators this morning family members were asked what Mr Megraw might have been wearing at the time he disappeared, with one brother, Sean, suggesting it could have been a duffel coat and jeans. Kieran Megraw said thoughts should also be with other families of the Disappeared whose quests continue to find loved ones abducted by the IRA. 'We are over the moon but surprised that it has come so quick after all this time,' he said. 'I didn't really expect to get the call. And it is looking like it really is Brendan, obviously there will be DNA tests and so on. 'It is quite a shock for the family. Sometimes you maybe ask yourself twice, has it really come about, but there's joy and relief that it looks like it is his body.' Mr Megraw was one of 17 people abducted, killed and clandestinely buried by republicans - the Disappeared. That list includes Gareth O'Connor who was murdered in 2003 by dissidents. His body was recovered on June 11 2005 at Victoria Quay, Newry Canal, Co Louth although the search and discovery did not fall within the Commission's remit. Forensic archaeologists surveyed Oristown bog one month ago and spent the last few weeks analysing radar surveys, searching for anomalies in the ground. Separate searches have also taken place on bogland a few miles away, near Wilkinstown, for the remains of Kevin McKee and Seamus Wright, both of whom were taken by the IRA in October 1972. It is also suspected Joseph Lynskey, a former Cistercian monk taken from the Beechmount area of west Belfast in the summer of 1972, was also buried somewhere in the region. The 'Disappeared' refers to the 16 people who are believed to have been abducted, murdered and secretly buried during Northern Ireland’s Troubles. Beginning in the late 1960s, the Troubles are generally thought to have ended with 1998’s Good Friday Agreement. The conflict was a political one with the main issue being the status of Northern Ireland and whether it should remain within the United Kingdom or join the Republic of Ireland. But the Troubles also had a sectarian aspect as the Irish Republicans were mostly Catholic and the Unionists mostly Ulster Protestants. More than 3,500 people were killed in three decades of violence. Following the Good Friday Agreement, the IRA admitted in 1999 that it murdered and hid the bodies of nine of the 16 Disappeared. The Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains leads the search for the bodies. Investigators believe one person living locally may hold vital clues to several families' decades-long quest to find the bodies of loved ones. Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams welcomed the latest discovery. 'I hope the identity of the remains can be quickly verified and that this discovery will bring some closure to the family and loved ones of Brendan Megraw,' he said. Mr Adams appealed for anyone with information on the Disappeared to contact the commission and insisted they would not face prosecution.","Remains could be those of Brendan Megraw from west Belfast .

"It was Jennifer Lopez who really pushed me over the edge. I mean if there is a better looking example of a 45 year old woman out there, I'd really love to see it. Her new video for Booty is probably the raciest she's ever done in her entire career– and she looks better than ever before. Yes Jennifer's workouts are full of all kinds of complicated Tracy Anderson dancing routines, but she's been dancing all her life. Jennifer Lopez puts her recent weight loss down to converting to a vegan diet . What is new however, is her diet. A few months ago she went VEGAN and has never looked back. Actually Jen is just the latest celebrity to embrace what is quickly becoming Hollywood's hottest eating plan. We all saw the pictures of Beyonce and Jay Z coming out of Vegan restaurants right after the birth of Blue, in fact Beyonce credits veganism with helping her shed 60 pounds of pregnancy weight. Jennifer appeared on the cover of US Weekly having lost 10 pounds in a 22 day cleanse . Despite her allegiance to Weight Watchers, Jessica Simpson turned to veganism to drop weight on the eve of her wedding. Other long-time vegans include Natalie Portman, Carrie Underwood, Russell Brand and Demi Moore. Even the world's hottest new husband, 50 year old Brad Pitt is vegan. It's catching on in the UK. At the moment current estimates are that there are around 150,000 Vegans in the UK and in 2013 40% more tried Veganism than the year previously. In fact, it's this diet that JLO credits with helping her shed the 10 pounds that had been sticking to her since the birth of her twins six years ago. Thus, with two stone still sticking to me after the birth of my baby 15 months ago, I decided to try to copy this ultra sexy mother of two. I'll be honest. The first day at Sainsbury's was a complete nightmare. I cannot handle salads all the time and found trying to meal plan infuriating. Ashley opted for a vegan diet delivery service from My FOOD . Ashley says that she lost 5 pounds almost immediately with the diet service, dishes include sun-dried tomato soup (left) and Thai red curry (right) Ensuring that I was getting the right nutrition after cutting out all animal products is challenging, and trying to come up with ideas for meals that actually sound edible to say the least. I'm not a huge fan of the vegetable, I'll just put that out there now. It's probably part of why I still have so much weight to lose. Not only that, but if you Google Vegan Diets you can find all kinds of experts out there saying that they are a truly horrible idea and bad for your health. It's pretty discouraging. Studies have shown that vegans are often low in vitamins D, B12 and iron for starters. In short, cutting out all dairy, eggs and meat means it takes a rather creative type who also happens to have the time to shop for produce, frequently; neither one of which applies to me. Henrietta Norton co-founder of food-state brand Wild Nutrition says, that actually there are pros and cons. 'A healthy vegan diet is a diet plentiful in vegetables and pulses, making it naturally lower processed foods, adulterated fats and higher fibre diet which can support a healthy weight.' She adds, however that. 'like any other dietary regime a vegan diet can easily be unhealthily too if based too much on processed or too many grains, which can lead to weight gain if not eaten in moderation. Ashley Pearson tried the vegan craze in an attempt to achieve JLO's amazing post baby bod . 'Any diet where significant food groups are avoided, you run the risk of limiting your intake of key macro and micro nutrients such as B12, iron, chromium and protein, all of which play a fundamental role in metabolism and can therefore reduce your body's ability to burn 'fuel', leading to weight gain and blood sugar imbalance.' It's tricky to get it right. Two things, in addition to JLO's bottom pushed me to give it a shot. One was a recent study funded by the National Cancer Institute which showed that vegans have significantly lower rates of cancer than both meat-eaters and vegetarians. Vegan women, for example, had 34 per cent lower rates of female-specific cancers such as breast, cervical, and ovarian cancer. The way they tested it was interesting. A series of experiments was performed in which people were placed on different diets and their blood was then dripped on human cancer cells growing in a petri dish. Women on a vegan diet for just two weeks were found to suppress the growth of three different types of breast cancer. It's believed that it had something to do with changes in the level of a cancer-promoting growth hormone in the body called IGF-1. Animal protein intake increases levels but a plant-based diet cause them to drop. Then there was a study done by prominent US physicians Drs. Dean Ornish and Nobel Prize winner Elizabeth Blackburn; they found that a vegan diet caused more than 500 genes to change in only three months, turning on genes that prevent disease and turning off genes that cause breast cancer, heart disease, prostate cancer, and other illnesses. So there was evidence that indicated I was on a good, healthy track for myself. Then came the Lazy Vegan solution – or the 'Hollywood At Home' plan. The first week my efforts varied from carb heavy meals – most store bought pasta is made without egg and thus OK - to boring green salads with slimey looking tofu. I was this close to giving up when a friend of mine recommended trying a vegan meal delivery service – just until I got the hang of things. I used MyFOOD (www.myfood.co.uk) and my desperate palate was transformed with Thai curries, cashew nut paella, vegan 'sushi', tofu Tikki Masala, and spelt pizzas. It illustrated that you can have delicious vegan food if you know what you're doing. In the UK Vegan diet delivery services are becoming more and more readily available. My FOOD founder Nas Amir-Ahmadi says, 'We have a variety of plans available but recently have been inundated with requests to put together a vegan plan. Doing it this way takes away some of the fear of not getting enough vitamins and at the same time, shows that you can eat really delicious food – it's not just all green salads all the time.' I lost 5 pounds almost immediately although in the weeks following it's been more gradual. What I have noticed though is that I feel better, I have fewer cravings for sugar and carbs and find that I am actually eating more carbs than usual but still losing weight. I feel good. And so does Jennifer Lopez. The still stunning star says she followed a 100% vegan diet for five weeks and felt incredible. 'It was a real change,' she said. 'I felt better and people were like, 'Your energy's better. The truth is, even if you're 70-80 percent vegan, it's so much better having those vegetables, greens, and plant-based stuff,' said Jennifer. 'It's going to change your life and health.'

"There is certainly no ‘waste not, want not’ badge for Girl Scouts of America, at least not in Southern California where over 13,000 boxes of the organization’s famous cookies were bulldozed to bits in a warehouse as bulldozer operators gleefully yelled ‘Goodbye girl scout cookies!’ SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . So-lon samoas: Over 13,000 boxes of Girl Scout cookies were bashed to bits in a California warehouse . Do-si-dump: The 1,100 bashed boxes of cookies were trucked off to the dump rather than given to the area needy . After the May incident, when the cookies were sent off to a landfill, leaders of area food banks are up in arms about the so-called service organization's wastefulness. Bitter Charity: Bruce Rankin of the West Side Food Bank in Santa Monica is astonished at so much precious, wasted food . Bruce Rankin, Executive Director of Santa Monica’s West Side Food Bank, watched footage from CBS 2 in Los Angeles, and was shocked as two heavy-duty construction vehicles repeatedly trounce through huge mounds of bright purple cookie boxes. Gleeful garbage men: A voice voice yells 'Goodbye, Girl Scout cookies!' in the footage taken last May . Rankin’s organization serves young children, the working poor, the disabled, and other needy groups in Sothern California. They’re supplied through food donations, but must purchase around half their food to meet demand. Sans giving: The crushed cookies were traced to the Girl Scouts Council of San Gorgonio . ‘We would gladly accept the cookies,’ Rankin said, still awed by the video he’d seen. ‘They would probably disappear as fast as any product we have here.’ The cookies, which were well within their expiration dates, were traced to the San Gorgonio Council of the Girl Scouts in Redlands, California. Finger pointing: San Gorgonio Girl Scouts rep Chuck MacKinnon blamed their supplier, ABC Bakery in Richmond, VA . A representative from the council, Chuck MacKinnon, avoided saying he was unaware the cookies had been destroyed. ‘We didn’t know that was the way they were being disposed of,’ he said. MacKinnon, on seeing the video, reacted with simple if not terribly regretful words. ‘To look at it, it’s a waste of food.’ Thin mints happens: A Gril Scout's USA rep told reporters, 'food is wasted all the time' MacKinnon pointed the blame at his supplier, ABC Bakery in Richmond, Virginia and said it was they who destroyed the cookies. Basically, he said, his council had bitten off more than they could chew. One percent of unsold boxes, MacKinnon said, can be returned to the bakery at no charge and he and his council had ordered far more than they could sell. That one percent totalled 13,200 boxes of cookies, the very cookies seen in the video. Not this year: The San Gorgonio Girl Scouts claim that just last year they donated 100,000 boxes, but evidently that didn't happen this year . ABC Bakery has not commented on the cookie smashing footage. However, a spokesperson at the Girl Scouts of the USA headquarters in New York was less than apologetic. ‘It’s a shame what happened in Riverside,’ said representative Michelle Tompkins, ‘but food is wasted all the time.’ MacKinnon, meanwhile, promised San Gorgonio Council will be taking steps to avoid a similar debacle in the future by placing smaller orders. The San Gorgonio Council of Girl Scouts also claims they have donated unsold cookies in the past, saying 100,000 boxes were given out last year alone. It remains unclear, however, why these particular boxies were, instead, smashed to bits.","1,100 cases of the coveted confections were smashed to bits as bulldozer operators hooted 'Goodbye Girl Scout Cookies!'

"Norman Mailer once likened Mohammad Ali to the Prince of Heaven. Some of the articles about Susie Wolff, the Williams test driver of all things, have been only moderately less gushing. She has been described by the Telegraph as the fastest woman in the world. The writer of that phrase may have taken her lead from a documentary of the same name about Wolff. That documentary was made by David Stoddart, who just happens to be Wolff's brother. I do not know Wolff at all. A friend of mine is a friend of hers and I am assured she is a nice woman. But it would be idle to deny that the hype has overtaken the reality in the projection of her as a future Formula One race driver. The evidence simply does not support the notion. To suggest otherwise is not only an insult to people's intelligence but to several drivers of greater promise. Dressed for success: Susie Wolff, the Williams development driver, poses for a fashion shoot . Behind the wheel: Wolff during testing for Williams at Silverstone, the home of the British Grand Prix . A few facts. She is not the fastest woman in the world. Danica Patrick is way ahead of her. Patrick's victory in the 2008 Indy Japan 300 is the only win by a woman in IndyCar series history and her third place at the Indianapolis 500 is he best finish by a woman. Wolff has never won a race in a car, as opposed to a kart. In DTM she has finished the season in 17th, 20th, 18th, 16th and 13th places and twice been not classified. She competed in Formula Renault and Formula Three for five years without any particular distinction. By contrast, James Calado, another Britain, finished second in the F3 Championship, second in GP3 and third in GP2, yet he is racing in sports cars after failing to cut the mustard in Formula One testing. Why then is Wolff Williams' test driver? Could it be anything to do with the fact her husband, Toto Wolff, became a director there in 2009? Surely not. (In passing, how can Mr Wolff be a shareholder at Williams and executive director at Mercedes?) Despite her lack of experience in an F1 car – one straight-line test and day in the young driver test at Silverstone last year – Wolff, 31, continues to make her case for a race seat and will, ludicrously, drive in practice sessions during grands prix weekends at Silverstone and Hockenheim this season. 'I focus on performance because once I put my helmet on it doesn't matter what I look like,' she said recently. 'If I don't perform I'm out. 'I'm not on a crusade to prove women deserve to be here. I'm on a crusade for Susie Wolff. I just want to be the best racing driver I can be. If I can break down barriers as well as help people, I will.' I wish her luck. I merely register my belief that the Susie Wolff story is primarily a publicity stunt. Missing out: Promising Brit James Calado has been overlooked by F1 teams . One or the other? Wolff poses with fashion accessories on her Twitter . Chequered flag: But it is debatable whether Wolff deserves her place . Those of us who believe in the rule of law – as opposed to anarchy – respect the FIA's role as the policemen of Formula One. So logic says we should hail the judges' decision to reject Red Bull's appeal against Daniel Ricciardo's expulsion from the Australian Grand Prix and instead support the FIA's right to determine what the rules are. But I am not sure it is as simple as that. Red Bull claim, quite convincingly I think, that the FIA's fuel sensor was unreliable and that they, in fact, were not breaking the fuel-flow limits. The FIA's authority surely depends on their enforcing the law fairly and correctly. Otherwise what legitimacy do they have? Unlucky: Red Bull had a case with Daniel Ricciardo's appeal . Seeing McLaren's de facto team principal Eric Boullier piling suitcases full of car parts nose high on several airport trollies this weekend reminded me of a nickname given to his predecessor, Martin Whitmarsh. Max Mosley, then the FIA president, disparaged Whitmarsh as 'the bag carrier', for supposedly lugging around Ron Dennis's briefcase. Speaking of Whitmarsh, I understand he is still in the process of agreeing his severance package. It is likely to be around £6million, a quarter of a million for each of the 24 years he was at McLaren. Factoring in that his final salary at McLaren was £2.5m, that's quite some compensation for Mosley's cutting remark. Pay-day: Former McLaren chief Martin Whitmarsh is likely to receive a pay-off of around £6million . Seeing as the smog in Shanghai is in your face – not to mention possibly creeping into one's lungs – it would seem a somewhat futile exercise to blank out coverage of the problem. Yet type 'Shanghai' and 'smog' into Google over here and it is hit and miss whether the related stories are accessible. On Thursday, next to none would open up. Friday, they would. Is this some form of half-baked censorship? That suspicion would be abated if the 'official' figures measuring the micrograms per cubic metre were not markedly lower than those issued by the US Consulate. Whatever the criteria, there is a gas mask in my hotel room. Difficult to breathe: The smog in Shanghai has hardly been mentioned by officials . Mercedes are wary of having their image tarnished by association if Bernie Ecclestone's criminal trial, which starts in Germany next week, should find him guilty of bribery. They cite 'compliance', referring to a European law about probity in company affairs. Why then potentially damage their own reputation by covering up the fact they tried to get Red Bull banned for three races over Daniel Ricciardo's fuel-flow irregularity? Twice they denied arguing for that Draconian punishment, only for me to see in black and white that they had repeatedly done so in a 95-page submission to the court. This, we note, is a team that banned me from their motorhome when I wrote what was perceived as an unflattering article about Lewis Hamilton, in which I revealed that his aide-de-camp, Tom Shine, was once convicted of fraud. I am still partially banned: I can go into the motorhome and to general press conferences but not to Hamilton's Fleet Street briefings. I take this in good spirit. I remember the jest of Nigel Dempster, the world's greatest gossip columnist. 'Writs, dear boy, are the Oscars of our business,' he said. Bans, I tell myself, are not far behind.","Susie Wolff is the Williams test driver who will drive in practice sessions at the British and German Grands Prix .

"Santa Barbara Sheriff's deputies checking on Elliot Rodger weeks before he killed six college students were aware of but didn't view disturbing videos that prompted calls about his well-being. The sheriff's office says Thursday that four deputies, a police officer and a dispatcher in training were sent to Rodger's apartment April 30 after being informed by the county's mental health hotline that Rodger's therapist and mother were concerned about videos he posted online. They questioned him for 10 minutes and then briefed Rodger's mother by telephone before having him speak to her directly. Scroll down for video . It was revealed Thursday that police knew about Elliot Rodger's disturbing YouTube videos when they checked in on him last month, weeks before he went on a rampage . They found him shy, timid and polite. He told them he was having trouble fitting in socially in Isla Vista and the videos were a way to express himself. He reposted some of the videos before Friday's rampage. On Monday, . sheriff's spokeswoman Kelly Hoover declined to discuss that visit in . greater detail, pending an internal investigation, but said that . deputies in general were barred from entering a residence without a . warrant. 'An . exception would be if deputies felt that a person was a harm to . themselves or others or there was an immediate threat,' Hoover said. 'In this case, we would have had to determine that Elliot Rodger or his roommates were in immediate danger.' Rodger wrote in his manifesto that he manipulated the officers to get them out of his hair. Rodger killed six and injured 13 in his Friday rampage. Above, his BMW pictured at the crime scene . 'I . tactfully told them that it was all a misunderstanding, and they . finally left. If they had demanded to search my room… That would have . ended everything,' he said in his manifesto. Authorities . say Rodger fatally stabbed three roommates in his apartment before . shooting three students to death near the University of California at . Santa Barbara. He then shot himself. The . two women and four men who were killed were aged 19 to 22 and students . at the school. Thirteen people were wounded, including eight shot by . Rodger as he sped through town in his black BMW, exchanging fire with . police, authorities said. 'HE WAS JUST VERY QUIET' Officers found Rodger dead in his car with three legally purchased pistols and more than 400 rounds of ammunition. Chris . Pollard, who lived in the same building as Rodger and knew him before . the attacks, told Reuters in an interview that the videos that had . concerned his mother should have been red flags for the sheriff's . department. Sheriff Brown has ordered an internal investigation of how his deputies handled their interaction with Rodger . 'When . it got to the point that the parents called the police, it makes me . wonder if the police even looked at the videos,' Pollard, 22, said. His suspicions turned out to be correct. 'If they'd looked at the videos, they could've done some sort of court order to do a search warrant.' But . the young man conceded that deputies would have needed legal grounds to . search Rodger or his home and may not have found that justification . during their visit to his apartment. 'When . you looked at him, there was no reason to get concerned. He didn't seem . like a threatening or intimidating guy. He was just very quiet,' Pollard said. David . Dusenbury, a former deputy chief of police in Long Beach, California, . said the deputies could have obtained a warrant if the video explicitly . threatened violence. 'If . the caller said they feared he was going to harm somebody or himself . based upon Internet postings, I would say the deputies did not go far . enough in their investigation,' Dusenbury said. He said that deputies could also have run Rodger through their system to learn he had guns registered in his name.","Santa Barbara Sheriff's deputies checked in on Elliot Rodger on April 30, after his therapist and mother voiced concern about his mental welfare .

"Climbers and trekkers travelling to the Himalayas could soon be required to take GPS tracking units with them, following the country’s worst ever trekking disaster. Nepalese officials are planning to introduce new rules, improve weather forecasts and better monitor the movement of tourists and local guides after at least 41 people were killed last week when a deadly blizzard and avalanches swept through the mountains. Tourism Department official Tulasi Gautam said tourists visiting the country’s popular mountain trails will be required to take trained local guides, and will have to rent a satellite navigation unit to help authorities trace them in case of an emergency. Nepal's Annapurna Circuit, a 140mile collection of mountain trails, is hugely popular with trekkers and climbers . He said the government plans to announce the new rules before the next trekking season in the spring. Officials say 41 people, including foreign tourists and local guides, were killed last week and more than 500 stranded trekkers were rescued after becoming trapped in a snowstorm in the Mustang, Manang and Dolpa districts north of Kathmandu. The area is hugely popular with tourists and on Sunday Nepalese officials were forced to close a section of the popular Annapurna trekking circuit because new groups of hikers had continued to pour into the area where most of the victims died. The snowstorms were caused by cyclone that hit the Indian coast a few days earlier. Hikers were stranded when the weather conditions deteriorated rapidly. A Nepalese Army helicopter rescues survivors along the Annapurna trail where at least 41 people were killed following snow storms last week . Rescue members carry the dead bodies of trekkers from the Thorung La mountain pass in Nepal, which was hammered by severe snowstorms and avalanches . Most of the victims were on or near the Annapurna trekking route, a 140-mile collection of trails through the mountain range. Many were caught on the Thorong La pass, one of the highest points on the circuit. However, experts have dismissed the idea of introducing the GPS systems as a ‘knee-jerk reaction’. Simon Lowe, managing director for the UK-based Jagged Globe mountaineering company said they would not prevent more disasters from occurring in Nepal. ‘Technology alone is not a solution to the problem,’ he said. ‘GPS systems often don’t work in harsh conditions anyway. ‘In this situation getting lost was not the problem, it was the fact that the climbers and their guides went out in a raging storm. ‘There needs to be better training and education in place for both the trekkers, local guides and porters on the mountains so that decision making is improved. ‘High-tech gadgets aren’t required to get weather forecasts. Long-wave radio is available throughout the mountains and which is capable of providing accurate weather forecasts. ‘Trekkers with little experience need to make sure they are hiring guides with sufficient training, knowledge and ability to draw upon in the event of an emergency. Tour operators can charge up to £1,800 for a three-week trek around the Annapurna circuit . Nepal's Tourism Department said tourists visiting the Himalyas will be required to take trained local guides, and will have to rent a satellite navigation unit to help authorities trace them in case of an emergency . ‘There needs to be a full public enquiry as to what went wrong, and no knee-jerk reactions’. Up to 12 Britons are still unaccounted for following the tragedy. Half of the dead were Nepali porters, guides and cooks, many of whom did not have any warm weatherproof coats or boots to protect them, something which has angered rescue leaders who claim Nepalese tour guides died because they were poorly equipped. They also suggest that foreign tourists were favoured in the rescue mission. Captain Adhikari, the Nepalese Army rescue leader who led more than 70 hikers to safety following the storm, said local victims had been wearing causal clothes, including flip flops and trainers. He told the Daily Telegraph: ‘The worst thing was seeing the equipment and gear of the Nepali porters and guides because it meant they were dead, but they were not well-equipped. ‘The Nepalis I saw were wearing normal dress, some of them in slippers, some had coats and some didn’t. They did not have proper clothes or protection from the snow...this could be a factor in why so many Nepalis died.’ Tour operators charge up to £1,800 for a three-week trek around the Annapurna circuit, but Captain Adhikari suggested that some porters earn as little as £9 a day. His comments were supported by Baburam Bhandari, the Nepal government’s chief district officer in charge of the rescue effort in Mustang, where most of the victims were found dead. ‘There was no preparation,’ he said. ‘Many trekkers that came into the storm arrived without planning. ‘Their porters had no trekking shoes or coats. They were in sports shoes and normal clothes because they’re poor - it is one of the causes of their deaths. 'Some of them died because they were too cold - it was freezing snow, five or six feet deep.’ Keshav Pande of the Trekking Agents Association of Nepal said his group offers low cost clothing and equipment rental for porters and guides but many of them believe they do not need them. Foreign trekkers often hire their own guides directly, rather than through established trekking companies, and are focused on keeping their costs down. ‘If the group is organised they have all the equipment but the tourists want cheaper, they get someone from the street to guide them. They want cheap, cheap, cheap’ he said.","Nepalese tourism officials plan to introduce new rules to monitor tourists .

"A pregnant prosecutor who was a rising star at the Delaware Attorney General's Office has died suddenly - along with her unborn daughter. Sarita Wright Lucas, 33, passed away unexpectedly in her Elkton, Delaware home around 7pm on Sunday after her husband discovered her in distress and called 911. The call indicated she had suffered cardiac arrest, Lieutenant Michael Holmes with the Cecil County Sheriff's Office told the Star Democrat, but an investigation into the cause of her death is underway. 'There were no signs of trauma and there were no signs of foul play,' Holmes said. Loved: Sarita Wright Lucas, 33, passed away suddenly on Sunday and investigations are underway to determine her cause of death. The prosecutor was six months pregnant when she died . No final cause of death has yet been given and she had no major issues in her medical history. Wright was six months pregnant and her daughter, whom she and her husband had planned to name Claire, also passed away. She had worked as a deputy attorney general in the Delaware Attorney General's Office since August 2008. Colleagues, who had spoken to her just hours when she pulled out of a Sunday meeting because she was tired, expressed their heartbreak over her sudden death. In a statement, Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden called her 'incredibly committed and accomplished'. 'Her passing is a shock to us all,' he wrote. 'As we deeply mourn her passing our hearts and prayers go out to her husband Tony and to her entire family.' Left behind: Husband Tony, a University of Delaware football coach, called 911 when he found her in distress . Loved: Mr Lucas said he doesn't think he'll ever come to terms with the loss of his partner of 15 years . Tony Lucas, an assistant football coach at the University of Delaware, went to work on Tuesday, where he was greeted with hugs and handshakes from well wishes, Delaware Online reported. 'Right now I need normal,' he said. 'I'm good in spurts and then as I reflect on it, it hits me again. I don't think I'll ever come to terms with it. I don't think I ever can.' The couple met 15 years ago when Lucas was a student at Columbia University in New York and Wright attended Barnard College nearby. They were married in 2012. 'Her heart was just so big,' he said. 'She'd go out of her way to help somebody else out regardless of what it meant to her own issues or her own work. She'd be the shoulder to cry on, she'd be the swift kick in the butt that you need.' Wright Lucas, who was from Boston, started working with the Delaware Attorney General's Office in June 2007 as a summer law clerk and was hired in August 2008. Devoted: Lucas Wright had been working for the Delaware Attorney General's Office since 2008 and colleagues described her as a tenacious prosecutor who was devoted to keeping the bad guys off the streets . Delaware Online noted that she quickly proved herself in court and rose through the ranks to became the youngest unit leader in the office. She took Wilmington, determined to keep the bad guys off the streets. Colleagues recalled how she would be the first person in the office and the last to leave at night, often wearing her Boston Red Sox cap. 'She was an essential part of the prosecution team and the fabric of our office,' said Deputy Attorney General Steve Wood. 'We loved her. Her potential was unlimited.' 'To say it is devastating is an understatement,' added David Baylor, Delaware City Chief of Police. Services for Wright Lucas will be held on Saturday morning in Milton, Massachusetts at the Alfred P. Thomas Funeral Home.","Sarita Wright Lucas, who was six months pregnant, died suddenly on Sunday and investigations are underway to determine the cause .

"A daughter who had to identify the bodies of her mother and sister who were shot by a puppy farmer has said she sees them 'every time she shuts her eyes'. John Lowe, 82, was found guilty of murdering 66-year-old Christine Lee and her daughter Lucy Lee, 40, with his shotgun at his home near Farnham, Surrey, in February and sentenced to life imprisonment at Guildford Crown Court today. Stacey Banner, daughter of Christine Lee and sister of Lucy, criticised Surrey Police after it emerged a number of Lowe's guns were returned to him just months before he carried out the shootings. Stacey Banner (left) has said how she is 'haunted' by the murder's of her mother and sister after they were shot by John Lowe, 82, (right) with his shotgun at his home in Farnham, Surrey in February . In a statement read to the court, Ms Banner said she was 'haunted' by her mother and sister's murders and her grief 'came crashing down' when she had to identify their bodies. 'Every time I close my eyes I see them,' she said. 'I have nightmares. I'm haunted by what John did to them.' Ms Banner said counselling had not helped her and her relationship with her husband had suffered. In another statement read by the prosecutor, Christine Lee's sister Julia James said she had felt 'physically and emotionally weak' since the deaths. 'Christine and Lucy were lovely people - kind, witty and generous,' she said. 'I miss them more than I can say.' Sentencing Lowe to life imprisonment, Mr Justice Singh praised the 'extraordinary courage' of Lucy Lee, who returned to face her killer following a frantic 999 call on the day of the shootings. Victim: Lowe told police he had not meant to shoot Ms Lee (pictured), but was found guilty of her murder . Lowe, flanked by three security officers, winked at those seated in the public gallery as he was brought into the dock. Jailing him, the judge said: 'Having heard the evidence at your trial, I have come to the conclusion that you did have an intention to kill both Christine Lee and Lucy Lee rather than to cause them serious bodily harm. 'I form that view because of the close range with which you used the shotgun, firing at their chests. 'I also form that view because in statements which you made to the police after the incident you said that you had to ""put them down"".' Elderly Lowe was also convicted of murdering Mrs Lee's 40-year-old daughter Lucy Lee (pictured) Ian Lawrie QC, mitigating, said his client was 'highly likely' to die during his sentence and Lowe had perceived his two victims as 'his jailers.' 'For several months prior to the deaths of these ladies, there were difficulties in Mr Lowe's life,' he said. 'The tragic death of Miss (Susan) Wilson (Lowe's long-term partner)... and over the pursuing months he experienced a decline in his personal affairs, business affairs and in life generally.' Mr Lawrie said the difficulties in Lowe's life could 'possibly explain why he erupted in anger and committed these terrible acts'. He added: 'The reality is, whatever term is given, he is going to die in prison.' Passing sentence, Mr Justice Singh said: ' On the morning of Sunday 23 February you lost your temper and took your shotgun out of its locked cabinet and used it to kill Christine Lee. 'She died of a single shotgun wound to the chest fired at close range from above. 'Lucy Lee was able to use her mobile phone to make a frantic and desperate call to the emergency services on 999. 'She said that you had shot her mum and she feared that you were going to shoot her as well. 'Nevertheless in an act of extraordinary courage, she went back; no doubt to see if there was anything she could do to help her mother. 'You then used the shotgun to shoot her twice, once to the back of the head and then fatally to the chest, again from an angle from above.In the meantime you must have had to reload your weapon because it had two barrels.' Lowe - pictured with dogs at his puppy farm - initially told police he had to 'put down' his victims, but later claimed the killings were an accident. He was found guilty of murder this week . A lawyer for Lowe - pictured arriving at his trial - said he would die in jail 'whatever the sentence' After sentence was passed there was an outburst from the public gallery with a woman screaming: 'What about all the animals he has killed.' Mr Justice Singh was forced to ask for quiet so that he could express his condolences to the families of the victims. Grieving Stacy Banner sobbed loudly with her head in her hands as Lowe was led down to the cells. Speaking on the steps of the court today, she spoke of her relief that it was 'all over,' after Lowe was sentenced for the murder of her mother and sister. 'I am just relieved that it is all over. He (John Lowe) is never getting out and he can never hurt anyone again.' Friends of Lowe heckled her as she made the brief statement. Armed police arrived at Keepers Cottage Stud puppy farm on February 23, where they found the two women dead. The trial heard that Lowe told officers the women 'treated me like s***', accusing them of starving him and trying to put him in a home so they could take his land. He told one officer: 'They had to be put down. There was nothing else I could do. I have had terrible problems with Christine. They have not let me eat.' It was only later that he began to tell police that their deaths were accidental. The double murder took place on February 23 this year off a quiet country lane in rural Surrey . Police at the scene where Lowe gunned down his two victims before shooting dead a number of dogs . The Independent Police Complaints Commission has launched an investigation into why police officers repeatedly ignored the danger posed by Lowe and gave him back his lethal weapons. In 1997, a registered police informant told a special squad that Lowe had tried to hire him as a hitman to kill his then-partner, Susan Wilson, who later died of cancer. Lowe, who will have his 83rd birthday in jail in two weeks, was not questioned and no action was taken against him. Then, just months before the bloodbath at his ramshackle Surrey farm, the 82-year-old had threatened to kill step-daughter Stacy Banner. Police confirmed they removed Lowe's guns from his farm in March 2013, after she reported the threats. Stacey Banner, the daughter of Christine Lee and sister of Lucy Lee, hit out at police over the killings . But his seven shotguns - including the weapon used in the murders - were then returned to him in July after he was deemed fit to have a firearm. Speaking earlier this week, Ms Banner said: 'John Lowe pulled the trigger but it was the Surrey Police who put the gun in his hands.' She said her sister and mother did not stand a chance when they were 'brutally and deliberately murdered' at close range with a shotgun. 'The shotgun was one of seven that had been returned to him by the police only months before he used it kill,' she added. 'He held a shotgun licence despite the police being repeatedly warned by me and others about the danger he posed to society, allowing him to kill and kill again. Surrey Police should not be allowed to escape their responsibility for these deaths.'","John Lowe jailed for life for shooting Christine Lee and her daughter Lucy .

"A beloved counselor was shot dead by her ex-boyfriend as she moved out of their home - before he turned the gun on himself, according to reports. Monica Van Laer, 33, and some of her family members were collecting her belongings from the apartment in Raleigh Hills, Oregon on Sunday when her ex pulled out a gun and shot her, her devastated sister told a neighbor, who spoke to The Oregonian. 'He shot my sister!' the woman screamed as she ran outside, the neighbor said. The ex-boyfriend, who has not been identified, shot himself below the chin but survived. He is recovering in hospital. Authorities have not confirmed the version of events, but they have said the death is being classed as a homicide and that they are not looking for any suspects. Loss: Monica Van Laer, 33, was killed inside her Portland-area home on Sunday afternoon. Friends and neighbors say she was shot dead by her ex-boyfriend, who then shot himself, but survived . The neighbor, Mike Peerman, told the Oregonian that the woman had arrived at the Broadmoor Apartments in the Southwest Portland with her sister, her sister's fiance and her parents on Sunday. The shooting occurred just 10 minutes later, he said, although he did not know how many shots were fired. Officers were called to the apartment around 2pm and found a chaotic scene of several people in and around the apartment, KOIN reported. The woman was found dead inside and the man was taken to a nearby hospital. No arrests have been made and authorities have not named the man who was injured. Van Laer's close friend Matt Chorpenning told the Oregonian that she had met her boyfriend while working in California and then he moved back to Oregon with her. Peerman said that the couple had moved in over the summer but that he never heard them arguing. Irreplaceable: Friends called Van Laer, left and right, 'a self-proclaimed geek' with a great sense of humor . Torn apart: Van Laer, pictured left with one of her sisters, reportedly arrived at the apartment to pick up her belongings with her parents, sister and her sister's fiance when she was attacked just 10 minutes later . In September, Van Laer told Chorpenning that she had just broken up with the man and had moved in with one of her sisters. He dedicated a blog post to his friend and appeared to confirm the neighbor's version of events. 'My friend was murdered by someone who has set foot in my home,' he wrote. 'My heart is completely broken... She was a truly beautiful person who made life seem more beautiful.' Hundreds of friends paid tribute to Van Laer on Facebook, while others raised thousands of dollars on gofundme to donate to her high school music and theater programs in her memory. An obituary pays tribute to a talented, enthusiastic young woman, a 'self-proclaimed nerd' with a 'one-of-a-kind sense of humor' who 'loved to bring others joy through laughter'. It explains that after high school - where she was a prominent member of the school band and theater productions - she studied technical theater at Chapman University in California. She worked on rigging plays before joining Starbucks for 10 years, eventually becoming a store manager. Chilling: A bullet hole can be seen in the window of the apartment that the pair had shared . Scene: Neighbors recalled the woman's sister running out from the home and screaming . Investigation: Police, pictured swarming the scene, have released little information about the case . 'Monica was someone who loved being near and being of service to her fellow human beings,' the obituary said. 'Monica truly had a special ability to connect with and engage with people in a positive way.' A former customer, Jim McCormack, in La Mirada, explained to the Oregonian: 'She took over a store that had a miserable atmosphere and turned it into a joyful place to visit.' In 2013, she started working as a family service and cemetery counselor, first in California and - after the role reminded her of the importance of family - she moved back to in Oregon. There, she worked at Skyline Memorial Gardens & Funeral Home in Portland as a family service counselor. 'She made everyone around her happier,' Chorpenning said. 'She just made us laugh and inspired us.'

"Let's get ready to rumble! These two tiger cubs are having a rip-roaring time frolicking in a pile of leaves that were waiting for them in their enclosure. They'll be vicious killers when they grow up but right now these cubs are just like any other house cat... albeit ones with sharper fangs and claws. Keepers at DierenPark Amersfoort surprised the three-month-old cubs by filling the pen with fallen leaves in an attempt to get the young tigers to get used to autumn conditions outside. Charming fellow: The three-month-old cubs were born in June and ventured outside seven-weeks after . Gotcha!: Cute cubs have fun the the pile of leaves that the zoo's animal keepers have placed in their enclosure . Tiger family: Angara gave birth to her first three cubs in June this year. The cubs have yet to meet their father, Ilya, who also lives in the zoo . Animal carer Martijn van der Sijde posted the video on YouTube and wrote: 'Autumn leaves have started to fall and it seemed fun and festive to usher in the first autumn for the cubs by letting them play with the leaves.' ‘It’s one way they can get used to all the leaves that are going to fall once they are outside.’ The zoo’s female tiger, Angara gave birth to her first three cubs in June this year. After seven weeks of being close to their mother, the animals were introduced to the outside world. ‘Now that autumn has begun, the animal keepers surprised the brothers with a lot of leaves. At first they were looking at the leaves in a strange manner as it was a new situation for them but they started playing very soon,’ Lize de Graaf, from the zoo told MailOnline. The gorgeous baby tigers seem to be having a blast as they roll about on the leaves rambunctiously while their mother paces the length of the room. The boys are oblivious to her presence, their attention captivated and held by the large pile on the floor. Things get a bit aggressive at one point as they start roughly patting each other, and even biting, but it’s all fun and games for the boys and they continue with clowning around in glee.

"School absenteeism has plummeted to a record low following a crackdown on term-time family holidays. New official figures show that in total, England’s primary and secondary pupils missed 35.7 million days of school in the autumn and spring terms of 2013/14 - down around 4.2 million from the same two terms the year before. The overall authorised absence rate - time off approved by schools - alone has dropped from 4.3per cent to 3.5per cent, with statisticians suggesting that this is due to a decrease in illness and agreed family holidays. Full classroom: Figures show that England’s primary and secondary pupils missed 35.7 million days of school in the autumn and spring terms of 2013/14 - down around 4.2 million from the same two terms the year before . In total, 2.5 million school days were lost because of family holidays, both those authorised by the school and unauthorised, down 0.8 million from 3.3 million the year before. Government officials suggested that this drop was down to former Education Secretary Michael Gove's tough new rules on holidays which mean that headteachers can now only grant permission for trips during term time in 'exceptional circumstances'. Previously, school leaders could grant up to 10 days leave a year for family holidays in special circumstances. Rules: School Reform Minister Nick Gibb (left) suggested the drop was down to Michael Gove's (right) new rules which mean headteachers can only grant permission for term time trips in 'exceptional circumstances' The change, which was brought in last September, has proved controversial, with opponents arguing that some families are unable to, or cannot afford to take breaks during school holidays. And the figures note a 'small increase' in family holidays that have not been approved by the school, suggesting that some parents are deciding to take family trips despite not gaining the school’s approval. The latest data also shows a fall in time missed due to illness, the most common reason for absence, with 2.7per cent of half days lost for this reason in the autumn and spring terms, down from 3.3per cent the year before. School Reform Minister Nick Gibb said: 'Our plan for education is getting more young people than ever before back in class, helping thousands more to fulfil their potential and realise their aspirations. 'Missing lessons can be hugely damaging to a pupil’s education - but today’s figures show more pupils than ever before are getting the best preparation for life in modern Britain.' The truancy, or unauthorised absence rate has also fallen slightly to 0.9per cent from 1per cent, the statistics reveal. And fewer youngsters are being classed as 'persistently absent'. Around 262,255 pupils missed 15per cent of lessons in the autumn and spring terms of 2013/14 - down from 439,105 who were in this category five years ago. A pupil who misses at least 15per cent of school time throughout their school career loses out on around 18 months of lesson time, the Department for Education said, damaging their chances of fulfilling their potential. Parents are legally responsible for ensuring children aged five to 16 attend school regularly, unless they are home educated. Headteachers, social workers or police can issue parents with penalty notices of up to £120 if a child regularly misses school, and their parents have not taken action or asked for help. If this is not paid a prosecution will follow, which can lead to a fine of up to £2,500, a community sentence, or even a three-month jail term. Changes: Former Education Secretary Michael Gove's reforms on school holidays in term time were brought in last September, and truancy fines have also risen . Council officials say that, aside from their education suffering, children who are often absent find it harder to sustain friendships, and are more likely to get involved with crime. The Government has insisted that its reforms to deal with school absence are starting to have an effect. Under the changes, truancy fines have risen from £50 to £60, and from £100 to £120 if they are not paid within 28 days. Guidance on school holidays has also changed, with headteachers now only granting permission for term time trips in 'exceptional circumstances'.","Pupils missed 35.7m school days in 2013/14 autumn and spring terms .

"A British woman arrested in Iran after attending a men’s volleyball match has gone on trial today. Ghoncheh Ghavami, 25, appeared before a judge accused of ‘propaganda against the regime’ – a charge which can carry a one-year jail sentence. The London graduate was detained as she and women’s rights campaigners tried to enter the Azadi Stadium in Tehran to watch a volleyball game. Detained: Law graduate Ghoncheh Ghavami, 25 (right with her mother Susan, 49) has spent more than 100 days in Iran's notorious Evin prison including 41 in solitary confinement after trying to attend a volleyball match . Evidence: This is the photo, taken after the women were prevented from entering the match, which is being used by the Iranian regime as supposed evidence of propaganda against the state. Miss Ghavami is circled . Under Iran’s strict Islamic laws, women are forbidden from mixing with male spectators at sporting events. Miss Ghavami was released on bail but then arrested when she tried to collect her belongings from a police station a week later, when the authorities discovered she had dual British-Iranian citizenship. She was thrown into solitary confinement in Iran’s notorious Evin political prison and has been held for more than 100 days, including 41 days in solitary. Miss Ghavami, a law graduate from the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, carried out a 14-day hunger strike in protest against her detention. Her British-born mother Susan, 49, said the hunger strike had now ended and the family hoped to learn the court’s verdict next week. Writing to her daughter’s supporters on Facebook, Mrs Ghavami said: ‘Today was my daughter’s court day. It was not a public court sessions. The family were not allowed inside the courtroom for the 90-minute trial of Miss Ghavami (pictured) Her mother Susan (left) told supporters: 'When they brought Ghoncheh, I laid a kiss on her beautiful face' ‘Before the commencement, when they brought Ghoncheh, I laid a kiss on her beautiful face and gave her as much comfort as I could in that brief time.’ The family were not allowed inside the courtroom for the 90-minute trial but Mrs Ghavami said they were allowed a brief and emotional family reunion once the session had finished. She said: ‘All of us gathered together for 20 minutes, [the] first time in hundred something days. Ghoncheh kept kissing her grandfather who she hasn’t seen for all these 109 days and kept weeping.’ Mrs Ghavami, who met and married Iranian surgeon Houshang Azam Ghavami after moving to Iran, said she had hand-fed her daughter to assure herself that her hunger strike was over. The family has spoken of their fears for her health after saying she seemed pale and weak during a prison visit. Iran’s judiciary denies that the charges against Miss Ghavami are linked to her attempts to watch the Iran-Italy volleyball match in June. She is accused of ‘propaganda against the regime’ in the Islamic republic and a spokesman said the charge was linked to national security. Ms Ghavami, 25, has been held in solitary confinement at Tehran’s notorious Evin Prison (pictured) Detained: Miss Ghavami was arrested after trying to watch a men's volleyball match at the Azadi Stadium . Protest: Social media campaigns have sprung up in a bid to pressurise Iran into releasing Miss Ghavami . Iran does not recognise dual nationality and views Miss Ghavami as an Iranian citizen, but Prime Minister David Cameron has raised her case with Iran’s president Hassan Rouhani when the two leaders met last month. Miss Ghavami’s family has said she supports the Iranian president and has appealed for her release. Her mother wrote: ‘The judge has arranged to give a verdict next week. I hope that by now next week this nightmare is over and my daughter is in my arms. Keep me in your prayers.’ Speaking before the hearing, her brother Iman, 28, said Miss Ghavami had only been allowed to meet her lawyer two days before the trial. He said she travelled to Iran to work for a charity teaching literacy to street children. Mr Ghavami, of Shepherds Bush, West London, said his sister had thought women were allowed to attend international volleyball matches and has called her arrest was ‘a truly tragic misunderstanding’. A petition organised by the family has gathered more than 600,000 signatures and Mr Ghavami told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘We want the authorities to know the whole world is watching.’","Law graduate Ghoncheh Ghavami, 25, tried to watch match in capital Tehran .

"It was a case of third time unlucky for Brendan Rodgers as the Liverpool boss once again failed to get the better of Jose Mourinho – the man who once mentored him in his roles as academy and reserve-team coach at Chelsea. Liverpool took the lead after Emre Can’s strike deflected in off Gary Cahill with nine minutes gone but Cahill then struck at the opposite end five minutes later before Diego Costa scored the decisive goal midway through the second half. Rodgers lost both outings against Mourinho last term, and the Liverpool boss would have been desperate to avenge the 2-0 defeat they suffered at the hands of the Blues which ultimately cost his side their first title in more than two decades. Jose Mourinho and Brendan Rodgers share a joke on the touchline during Liverpool's clash against Chelsea . Rodgers greets his former mentor ahead of his side's lunch-time match against Mourinho's Chelsea . Rodgers and Mourinho are sitting in opposite dugouts for the third time - the latter won both matches last term . He made seven changes from the side that lost against Real Madrid in the week with captain Steven Gerrard, £16million Mario Balotelli and England international Raheem Sterling among those recalled. And the home side certainly had the better of the opening exchanges before Mourinho, who drafted in Ramires to provide Chelsea with a steelier feel, saw his side settle into the match. Costa’s strike with 66 minutes gone was no more than the visiting side, who are unbeaten in their opening 11 matches of the Premier League campaign, deserved. Rodgers threw on Rickie Lambert for the ineffectual Mario Balotelli in the closing stages, but the former Southampton man was unable to have any impact on a resolute Chelsea defence, led by captain John Terry. Emre Can's first-half strike deflects in off Gary Cahill to give Liverpool the lead after nine minutes . Cahill hauls Chelsea level just five minutes later after his header wriggles over the line at the Kop end . The hosts were unfortunate not to be given a late penalty when Steven Gerrard’s left-footed strike appeared to hit Cahill’s arm. But in truth Liverpool didn’t do enough to really test the league leaders and are now already 15 points adrift of Mourinho’s side. In an interview with Sportsmail during his time at Swansea, Rodgers said: ‘Jose was simply a wonderful influence on my career. He couldn’t do enough to help a hungry young coach. ‘He was always interested to hear my opinions and to share his. As a young coach, you are forever indebted to people like that, who become such an influence on you.’ Rodgers and Mourinho shared a joke and an embrace in the build-up to the lunchtime kick-off; their respect for one another still clear. But their handshake at the final whistle was less amorous. It’s three games and three defeats for Rodgers and his mentor certainly holds the upper hand.","The Chelsea and Liverpool managers remain on good terms following their time together at Stamford Bridge .

"The Army has dropped murder charges against a soldier in the shooting of two unarmed Iraqi boys during a blown reconnaissance mission in 2007. Sgt. 1st Class Michael Barbera, 32, does still face prosecution on allegations that he obstructed the investigation and threatened a journalist's wife. The murder charges were dropped against  Barbera after I Corps Commander Lt. Gen. Stephen Lanza at Joint Base Lewis-McChord reviewed the results of a pretrial hearing held last spring,The News Tribune of Tacoma reported. Sgt. 1st Class Michael Barbera (pictured) had murder charges dropped against him . The results of the hearing in Tacoma, Washington, have not been made public. Witnesses said the brothers were shot as they herded cattle in Diyala Province. Barbera was part of a team that was supposed to remain hidden for a few days to monitor enemy activity. Five soldiers who were with Barbera that day said in testimony at a pretrial hearing in April that they did not perceive the boys to be a threat. One, former Spc. John Lotempio, testified that the boys were 200 yards away when Barbera took a knee, aimed and fired. The shooting wasn't initially reported up the chain of command, but the Army looked into it two years later and declined to prosecute. Some of Barbera's fellow soldiers remained troubled by that and spoke with a Pittsburgh paper, The Tribune-Review, which published an investigation in 2012. Sgt. 1st Class Michael Barbera (pictured) does still face prosecution on allegations that he obstructed the investigation and threatened a journalist's wife . Barbera was charged last fall. His lawyer, David Coombs, called the allegations baseless and questioned why — if the shooting violated rules of engagement and was so troubling — Barbera's comrades failed to report it for two years. Coombs alleged that the newspaper's 'hit piece' and congressional pressure improperly influenced the Army's decision to file charges. The remaining charges allege that Barbera threatened the wife of the Tribune-Review reporter, saying she needed to tell him to back off the story, and that he tried to get a soldier in 2009 to tell investigators the boys might have been wearing suicide vests. Barbera could face up to eight years in confinement if convicted. Barbera was serving with a cavalry squadron from Fort Bragg's 82nd Airborne Division when the boys were shot.","Sgt. 1st Class Michael Barbera, 32, still faces prosecution on allegations he obstructed the investigation and threatened a journalist's wife .

"Suicide prevention charity Samaritans has launched a new Twitter app that enables users to monitor the accounts of their friends for distressing messages . A new app aims to help suicidal people by alerting their friends when they post messages online which might suggest that they are considering killing themselves. The programme, dubbed 'Samaritans Radar', was created by suicide prevention charity the Samaritans, and must be downloaded by individual users who are then able to monitor people they follow on Twitter for potential warning signs. This is done by Samaritans' specially created algorithm that identifies words and phrases that could suggest depression or suicidal thoughts - such as 'help me', 'hate myself' or 'tired of being alone'. Joe Ferns of Samaritans said: 'Social media has changed how we talk to each other. It has created a dis-inhibition effect that means people are being more honest online. 'We know that people struggling to cope often go online looking for support, however, there is still so much we need to learn about why this happens and how we can make the online environment safer for vulnerable people.' Mr Ferns said that this new tool would help because rather than placing them directly in front of an organisation, friends can step in to offer help first. 'By not addressing this issue we run the risk of shutting these discussions down and driving them underground. 'Instead we need to use tools such as Samaritans Radar to encourage people to look out for one another online, helping them to reach out and offer support. People will go to friends first. 'This app and the guidance provided enables them to help.' After activation, users will receive an alert via email when a potentially worrying tweet is spotted. Once a user has logged in, they will be able to see the tweet and confirm whether or not it is a potential worry. If a user confirms that a tweet is worrying, information and guidance on how to approach the poster and talk to them is sent out. The advice will include tips on how to introduce the idea of contacting Samaritans, but the charity suggested that they would not get involved unless requested to do so by those involved. Mr Ferns said that Samaritans were hoping to work with other social networks such as Facebook as well, but claimed that Twitter is easier to monitor because it is 'more open'. If a user confirms that a tweet is worrying, information and guidance on how to approach the poster and talk to them is sent out. File picture . Simon McAvoy, from digital agency Jam, who created the app, said: 'Social media gets a lot of bad press, but we believe there is good to be done.' Patricia Cartes, Twitter's global head of trust and safety outreach, said that the younger generation were the key audience for the new app. 'While the app is aimed at anyone using Twitter, the key audience for Samaritans Radar is the ""Millennials"" group - otherwise known as Generation Y - which typically includes 18 to 35-year-olds. 'They are ""digital natives"" - growing up using new technology and the first generation to grow up with computers in their home.' Professor Jonathan Scourfield, from the school of social sciences at Cardiff University, explained that a pattern had been found between suicidal language being posted online, adding that the number of suicides highlighted the need to monitor places such as Twitter more. 'Through social media there has been a normalisation of suicidal language through repeated use online,' he said. 'Twitter is important because past studies have found that a correlation between suicidal statements posted online and resulting suicides exists.' Anyone with a Twitter account can activate Samaritans Radar by visiting the website and signing into Twitter and providing an email address for alerts to be sent to.","App will monitor a friend's Twitter feed for troubling posts and alert user .

"The sergeant who discovered remains that could belong to missing UVA student Hannah Graham said 'divine intervention' led him to the body. Sergeant Dale Terry, with the Chesterfield County Sheriff's office, found the remains in a shallow grave  on an abandoned property in Albemarle County, Virginia on Saturday. Authorities have not yet confirmed that the body belongs to the 18-year-old University of Virginia student, who was last seen after a night out with friends in Charlottesville on September 13. But CBS19 reported on Sunday that sources had confirmed the body is Hannah's. It also emerged that her suspected kidnapper, Jesse Matthew, 32, grew up around Albemarle County. Scroll down for video . Found? A body found in a rural area of Albemarle County could belong to missing student Hannah Graham . Sergeant Terry explained that he and his team were about to finish searching when he decided to push on. 'We were on our way back to our vehicle and I just decided to keep going and we swept a different area and luckily we came upon what we came upon,' he told Fox5. 'Divine intervention is the only thing I can think of.' He said that it had been a 'huge shock' to come across the young woman's body. 'We came out here to assist, but you don't prepare yourself for finding something like that,' he added. 'It was just an unreal feeling to be honest with you.' Discovery: Sgt. Dale Terry, pictured, found the body during a search on Saturday. He said his team had finished searching for the day but he felt compelled to continue - and believes God wanted him to find the girl . Search: Albemarle County sheriff deputies search the road leading to the area where the body was found . Investigation: The body has not been identified yet but it is believed to belong to the 18-year-old student . Police let Graham's parents know about the discovery before they publicly released the information and instead of continuing the search for Graham, they focused Sunday on looking for clues and evidence in a heavily wooded area of Albemarle County that is home to horse farms. Matthew, the last person seen with Graham, has been charged with abduction with intent to defile her. He is being held in the Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail. Witnesses have said they saw Matthew with Hannah on the night she disappeared. The spot at which the human remains were found, on Old Lynchburg Road in Albemarle County, is not far from where Matthew's mother used to live. He is said to have grown up in the area and to be familiar with it. The remains were also discovered roughly six miles from where the body of 20-year-old Virginia Tech student Morgan Harrington was found after she vanished in 2009 after attending a concert. Close: Graham disappeared a month ago during a night out in Charlottesville. The body was found about eight miles away on an Old Lynchburg Road abandoned property . Emotional: Charlottesville Police Chief, Tim Longo,  wipes his eyes as he briefs the media on the discovery of remains in Albemarle County during a news conference in Charlottesville on Saturday . Her body was found three months later on an Albemale County farm. Police have said forensic evidence connects Matthew to Harrington's killing, which in turn is linked by DNA to a 2005 sexual assault in northern Virginia. Matthew hasn't been charged in those cases. Graham hasn't been seen since September 13 after a night out with friends. She had met friends at a restaurant for dinner before stopping by two off-campus parties. She left the second party alone and eventually texted a friend saying she was lost, authorities said. In surveillance video, she can be seen walking unsteadily and even running at times, past a pub and a service station and then onto a seven-block strip of bars, restaurants and shops. On Sunday, the area was buzzing with people having brunch at outdoor cafes on a brisk, sunny day. Graham's disappearance and the discovery of human remains was a frequent topic of conversation. Suspect: Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr., pictured in court on September 25, has been charged with abduction with intent to defile Graham. He allegedly appears near her on surveillance footage on the night she vanished . Link: Police have said DNA evidence connects Hannah's disappearance with that of Morgan Harrington, another student in Virginia who went missing in 2009. Her body was also found in Albemarle County . 'Everybody was rattled. Everybody knew it was coming, but you still hope for the best. As much as you can prepare for it, you can never prepare for it,' said Claire Meyers, a University of Virginia nursing student who has friends who knew Graham and Matthew. Matthew was an operating room technician at the university's hospital, where Meyers works as a patient care assistant. Albemarle County resident Bill Gnas, a retiree who lives a few miles from where the remains were found, said he suspected the worst. 'Truly, I was saddened by it,' he said. 'After three or four days you had to anticipate it was going to be another Harrington event where they were going to find the body, and the only thing you could hope for at that point was that there be some closure for the parents that it was in fact discovered.'","Sergeant Dale Terry discovered the remains on an abandoned property in Albemale County, Virginia on Saturday .

"'Hated': Riley Anapol was named in virgin killer Elliot Rodger's 141 page dossier despite not having seen him since he was six-years-old . A man who virgin killer Elliot Rodger said he hated in the warped 141-page manifesto he wrote just days before slaughtering six people, has told how he hadn't seen him for 15 years. Riley Anapol, 21, said he was shocked to have been mentioned in document which crazed Rodger emailed to his parents and friends before going on a bloody rampage in Santa Barbara last weekend. Mr Anapol said he does not remember Rodgers, who was in the same school as him for one year, and that the last time they met was when he was six-years-old. Rodgers, . whose bitter resentment of the world appears to have stemmed from the . fact he was unable to attract women, said he resented Anapol who got ' lots of girls'. He . wrote: 'Early in my Third Grade year, my mother would often take us to a . festival near Topanga Canyon Boulevard, wheresmall concerts were held . and people barbequed great food. 'A . friend of hers had something to do with these events, and I played with . the son of this friend. He was named Riley Anapol, and he was two years . younger than me. A First Grader. I played with some other younger kids . there as well, peers of Riley, and I had a good time. 'Riley . became a common friend for a while. The significance of this is that . Riley Anapol would eventually become someone I would harbor a great . hatred for. 'Riley . would grow up to get lots of girls, and I would grow up to be rejected . by girls. But back then he was a friend, a peer, and we were playing . together as equals. It’s funny how the world works.' But Mr Anapol, a politics student, said he had few memories of the time. He told the Daily Mirror: 'It is tragic that he felt that there was any issues between us, because I truly didn't know him. 'We were very small and I don't even remember being his friend.' Bitter: Elliot Rodger wrote a rambling 141 page 'manifesto' detailing his hatred of women shortly before slaughtering six people in a terrifying killing spree . The 141-page document, which the 22-year-old virgin emailed to his parents and friends before he killed six people on Friday last week, gives a terrifying insight into Rodger's hatred towards women for failing to pay him attention. In one . excerpt from last year, he wrote about getting beaten up after attending . a party in Isla Vista just days before his 22nd birthday in one 'last . ditch effort' to lose his virginity. On . Friday last week, Rodger, the son of Hunger Games assistant director . Peter Rodger, killed six people before shooting himself dead. Weihan . Wang, 20, of Fremont, and Cheng Yuan Hong, 20, of San Jose, were both . stabbed to death by Rodger on Friday at the apartment they had shared . with him. Investigators are looking into whether he killed the pair in . their sleep. The body of another UCSB student, George Chen, 19, of San Jose, was also found at the apartment, but he did not live there. Rodger then climbed into his car and drove towards the Alpha Phi sorority house, where he shot dead Katherine Cooper, 22, and Veronika Weiss, 19. Gesture: Mark Barden, who lost his son Daniel in the Newtown school shootings reached out to Richard Martinez, whose son Christopher was gunned down by Elliot Rodger . He then got . back into his car and drove to a nearby deli, where he opened fire. There, he killed student Chris Michael-Martinez, 20, in an attack that . was captured on surveillance footage. The . gunman then climbed back into his car and continued to shoot at . passersby as he drove, hitting three pedestrians before he police . officers returned fire and shot him in the hip. He tried to escape and knocked down a cyclist, before he eventually shot himself in the head and smashed into parked cars. When police . found his body, he was surrounded by three semi-automatic handguns and . nearly 400 rounds of ammunition, which had all been purchased legally. Earlier this week the father of a seven-year-old boy killed in the Newtown school shooting reached out to the father of Chris Michael-Martinez to say You're not alone. Mark Barden has written a heart-wrenching open letter to Richard Martinez - offering his condolences and his support. 'We have not met, but you are now part of our extended family,' Barden writes in a Facebook message. 'It is not a family we chose, but a family born from the horrible circumstance of losing a child to gun violence - one that’s only growing each day.' Chris Michael-Martinez, 20, was gunned down at a convenience store. He was planning to go to London this summer and had been aspiring to law school . Mr . Martinez's son 20-year-old Christopher Ross Michaels-Martinez, a student . at the University of California, Santa Barbara, was killed Friday as he . walked into a convenience store - one of three students shot dead by . Rodger. Mr . Martinez has been a furiously outspoken since the day after his son's . murder. In one speech he blamed the seven deaths on 'craven, . irresponsible politicians and the NRA.' On . Tuesday, he brought 20,000 mourning college students to their feet with . his chant 'Not One More' at a memorial service for the victims of . Rodger's rampage. Mark and his wife Jackie have been similarly outspoken since their son Daniel was gunned down at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December 2012. They have appeared alongside President Barack Obama as he pushed for increasing gun control and background check restrictions. They have also granted numerous media interviews - perhaps more than any other Newtown family - to talk about their son's legacy and to advocate for laws that they say could help prevent future mass shootings. Police have said that Rodger was carrying three semi-automatic handguns that he purchased legally from a local gun shop.","Riley Anapol, 21, mentioned in Elliot Rodger's crazed 'manifesto'

"Broadchurch. It's a name that has gripped a nation for two months. Tautly plotted, brilliantly acted, the eight-part murder mystery reaches its climax at 9pm tonight with a special 65-minute denouement. ITV executives have kept the final episode sealed off like a crime scene — no journalists have been allowed to see previews. But the whole country is speculating over who killed 11-year-old Danny Latimer, the boy found strangled at the foot of cliffs on the beach of a rural Dorset town. Nearly ten million viewers are addicted to this slow-burning drama. It's been acclaimed as the best story to hit our screens since the original run of The Killing, the Danish crime series that has proved a heavy influence on Broadchurch. Both examine the impact on a close-knit family when a child is killed and how the deepest buried secrets will bubble up to the surface. Who dunnit? The whole country is speculating over who killed 11-year-old Danny Latimer in Broadchurch . But the British show adds a unique psychological layer: the whole community is ripped apart by the tragedy. Neighbours stare at each other in suspicion, children are kept indoors by anxious parents, local businesses struggle to stay afloat, innocent people become scapegoats, journalists make the town a byword for child murder. If you haven't succumbed to the dark fascination of Broadchurch, you've been missing out on a TV event that's the equal of that great Dallas cliffhanger Who Shot JR? But even if you've been glued to every episode, it's unlikely you've grasped all the clues or followed every undercurrent of enmity. The show defies genres. Much of the drama focuses on Detective Inspector Alex Hardy (David Tennant) and his sergeant, vulnerable and trusting Ellie Miller, played by Olivia Colman, but this is no mere police procedural. Unlike CSI, for instance, Broadchurch does not follow the police team through every painstaking step of the investigation and interviews. Nor is this a serial killer drama where a fresh body turns up before every set of adverts. There has been one murder, and that is unbearable enough. Thrilling cliffhanger: Mark Latimer and Nige Carter are just two of the characters in the frame for murder . The . crime won't be unravelled by some superhuman sleuth, a Sherlock or a . Morse. And neither is this a cop thriller, in the mould of Kiefer . Sutherland's 24 franchise. The . only fight-and-chase scene in Broadchurch ended when Alex Hardy, . Tennant's character, was felled by heart arrhythmia and was rushed to . hospital. It's all a far cry from Starsky & Hutch. Writer . and creator Chris Chibnall, who has previously worked on Doctor Who and . Law And Order: UK, claims the series was not conceived as a whodunnit: . 'It's always been about community — places where people know each . other's business. 'The murder of a child is more powerful in such a community, where you can clearly demonstrate the impact of a terrible event.' That's the point: like many small towns across Britain, everyone in Broadchurch knows everyone else. Or they thought they did . Suspects: Susan Wright, Joe and Rev Coates are also under the viewer's murder mystery spotlight . As the investigation has unravelled, suspicion has been thrown on all the inhabitants. Sergeant Ellie Miller's 11-year-old son, Tom, knew the victim well, and now he's frantically trying to delete information from his phone and laptop. The adults all thought that Tom was a close friend of the murdered boy, but it transpires the pair were enemies. Tom goes out of his way to tell the dead boy's sister Chloe: 'I hated him!' Worse still, Ellie's partner Joe might not be the harmless house-husband he seemed to be. Gripping: Broadchurch has provided the most thrilling cliffhanger since the 'Who shot JR' storyline in Dallas . Alex Hardy has been warning Ellie from the start that she can't afford to trust anyone. If Joe turns out to be the killer, the whole series will turn on one crucial line — a question Detective Sergeant Miller asked in the CID interrogation room as she quizzed a female suspect, Susan Wright. Wright, played by the superb Pauline Quirke, revealed her own husband had abused and murdered their daughter. Ellie could not fully believe Wright's story, and accused her: 'How could you not know what was happening under your own roof?' The implication was like a silent scream: has Ellie's husband, without her knowledge, been abusing their son? And did Danny die because he knew too much? For weeks it seemed certain Quirke's character was involved in the murder. But though last Monday we learned she was the first to find the body — and actually stood beside it, smoking cigarettes — it seems she was shielding a different secret . . . she is the biological mother of the town's nastiest character, poacher Nige Carter. Violent, deceitful, twisting, thieving . . . that's Carter on a good day. He works as a plumber's mate for Danny Latimer's father, Mark, and supplements his income by hunting pheasants with his crossbow. What he forgot to mention to the police, and to the Latimers, is that he used to take Danny poaching with him. Carter lied to the police from the outset, though he says he did it to help Mark Latimer with his alibi. And that prised open another secret: the happy marriage between Danny's parents was a sham. On the night his son died, Mark was having a sexual assignation with the local hotelier, Australian Becca Fisher. Head starting to spin? Don't worry. That's what the programme makers want — and it all adds to the intrigue. High standard: The highly-acclaimed Danish drama The Killing proved a heavy influence on Broadchurch . Hotelier Becca is no better than she ought to be: apart from sleeping with married men, she procures drugs for hotel guests. There are undertones of drug crime throughout the series: 15-year-old Chloe Latimer's older boyfriend is the local dealer. But Mark's infidelity has shocked everyone. He's the town's Mr Cheerful, liked by all. In a dramatic early scene, the camera followed Mark through the town in a technically brilliant tracking shot, the lens never leaving him as he greeted a string of friends. The subtext was plain: everyone knew . Mark, everyone trusted Mark and Mark had a different face for everyone. He could be charming, matey, jokey, respectful, flirty and curt, . switching between personalities like settings on a dial. Another . character who wears a mask is the Rev Paul Coates —played by Arthur . Darvill, David Tennant's former co-star from Doctor Who (he played Rory . Williams, Amy Pond's fiance). The vicar has a hidden past. He claims to . be on the side of the angels, but he has his demons — he is a recovering . alcoholic and an insomniac who wanders the town by night. Broadchurch: Tautly plotted, brilliantly acted, the eight-part murder mystery reaches its climax tonight . Weaselling his way into the Latimer family, as if he's feeding on their anguish, Coates has even managed to appoint himself as their marriage guidance counsellor, despite the fact neither of them is religious. In one chilling scene, DI Hardy saw Coates sitting with 11-year-old Tom Miller, with his hand on the boy's knee. To make the mystery still more convoluted, there's the telephone engineer who claims to be receiving psychic messages from Danny Latimer beyond the grave, the manipulative young journalist exploiting the story to boost his career and the newsagent with a past conviction for sex crimes who killed himself after town vigilantes set upon him. At the centre of the town's anguish is Danny's mother, the only character who seems above suspicion. Beth Latimer was just 15 when she and Mark got together, and she is still young — the grief of actress Jodie Whittaker has made the show compelling. We are desperate to know who killed Danny, not because we're afraid he (or she) will strike again, but because Beth's life will be in tatters until the criminal is found. Star: David Tennant has won plaudits for his role in Broachurch . But it's not only the psychological tension that has us enthralled. Tennant's character has been falling apart throughout the series: he began as a cynical pro and now he's driving himself to collapse, clutching at anything he can reach. He's haunted by dreams where he sees the suspects' faces as they stand at the sea's edge, and he's twice been rushed to hospital after cardiac incidents — only to discharge himself hours later. Alex Hardy's illness could have blinded him to the most obvious clue of all, one flashed in front of our faces at the start of every episode. We first met this Glaswegian policeman with the granite exterior and the weak heart in a clifftop field overlooking the English Channel. He was investigating a petty crime: criminals had cut the barbed wire fence and syphoned diesel off from a tractor. Last week Nige the poacher admitted he was the fuel thief. Joe Miller: 4/7 .

"To date, humanity has landed spacecraft on the moon, Venus, Mars, Saturn's moon, Titan and two asteroids - Eros and Itokawa. But one month from today, a new celestial body will hopefully be added to that list: a comet, namely 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Esa has today confirmed that the landing attempt of the Philae probe on 12 November will go ahead, and engineers will be holding their breath in the run up to the attempt in the hope it is successful. Esa, headquartered in Paris, has confirmed Rosetta will attempt to land on a comet on 12 November. The daring descent its Philae probe (artist's impression shown) will take seven hours from separation. It will be exactly nine years to the day that a similar landing attempt on an asteroid by Japan's Hayabusa failed in 2005 . Philae's landing site, currently known as Site J and located on the smaller of the comet's two 'lobes', was confirmed following a comprehensive readiness review. Since the arrival on 6 August 2014, the mission has been conducting an unprecedented survey and scientific analysis of the comet, a remnant of the early phases of the Solar System's 4.6 billion-year history. At the same time, Rosetta has been moving closer to the comet: starting at 62 miles (100km) on 6 August, it is now just 6.2 miles (10km) from the centre of the body. This allowed a more detailed look at the primary and backup landing sites in order to complete a hazard assessment, including a detailed boulder census. 'Now that we know where we are definitely aiming for, we are an important step closer to carrying out this exciting - but high-risk - operation,' says Dr Fred Jansen, Esa's Rosetta mission manager. 'However, there are still a number of key milestones to complete before we can give the final Go for landing.' The decision that the mission is 'go' for Site J confirms the timeline of events leading up to the landing. Rosetta will release Philae at 08:35 GMT/09:35 CET on 12 November at a distance of approximately 14 miles (22.5km) from the centre of the comet. The landing will be about seven hours later at around 15:30 GMT/16:30 CET. During the seven-hour descent, Philae will take images and conduct science experiments, sampling the dust, gas and plasma environment close to the comet. It will take a 'farewell' image of the Rosetta orbiter shortly after separation, along with a number of images as it approaches the comet surface. It is expected that the first images from this sequence will be received on Earth several hours after separation. Once safely on the surface, Philae will take a panorama of its surroundings. Again, this is expected back on Earth several hours later. The first sequence of surface science experiments will begin about an hour after touchdown and will last for 64 hours, constrained by the lander's primary battery lifetime. Longer-term study of the comet by Philae will depend on for how long and how well the batteries are able to recharge, which in turn is related to the amount of dust that settles on its solar panels. In any case, it is expected that by March 2015, as the comet moves closer in its orbit towards the Sun, temperatures inside the lander will have reached levels too high to continue operations, and Philae's science mission will come to an end. The Rosetta orbiter's mission will continue for much longer. It will accompany the comet as it grows in activity until their closest approach to the Sun in August 2015 and then as they head back towards the outer Solar System. The relatively smooth landing region, identified for the moment simply by the letter 'J', is located on the smaller of the duck-shaped comet's two lobes. An inset showing a close up of the landing site is also shown . A series of Go/No-Go decisions must be taken before separation, starting on 11 November with a confirmation from the flight dynamics team that Rosetta is on the right trajectory ahead of delivery of the lander. Further Go/No-Go decisions will be made during the night of 11-12 November concerning readiness and uplink of commands, culminating in confirmation of the lander's readiness for separation. A short manoeuvre must then take place around two hours before separation. This will set Rosetta on course to release Philae on the right trajectory to land on the comet. The final critical Go/No-Go for separation occurs shortly after this manoeuvre. After the release of Philae, Rosetta will manoeuvre up and away from the comet, before reorienting itself in order to establish communications with Philae. 'If any of the decisions result in a No-Go, then we will have to abort and revise the timeline accordingly for another attempt, making sure that Rosetta is in a safe position to try again,' says Dr Jansen. Close-up of Philae’s primary landing site J, which is located on the ‘head’ of Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko. Site J offers the minimum risk to the lander in comparison to the other candidate sites, and is also scientifically interesting, with signs of activity nearby . The agency had been quick to select a landing site and prepare for the touch down since Rosetta arrived in orbit around the comet on 6 August 2014. This is because they want to attempt the landing before the comet gets closer to the sun and becomes more active. When this happens it is thought it will release more water vapour, which may be hazardous to the lander’s health. The landing itself even without this hazardous water vapour will be incredibly tense, as such an endeavour has never been successfully completed before. The closest comparison is the attempting landing on an asteroid of a probe called Minerva attached to Japan’s Hayabusa spacecraft on 12 November 2005. However, in that instance the lander was released at too great a height - and it floated off into space instead of drifting towards the asteroid. Mission operators for the Rosetta mission will be hoping such a fate does not befall the Philae lander. Nonetheless, Rosetta will still be continuing to study the comet into the future regardless of the outcome of the landing attempt. It will use its 11 scientific instruments to study the comet as it orbits the sun. The agency had been quick to select a landing site and prepare for the touch down since Rosetta arrived in orbit around the comet on 6 August 2014. This is because they want to attempt the landing before the comet gets closer to the sun and becomes more active (jets of vapour shown shooting into space here) The high-risk manoeuvre, if successful, will be the first time in history that a probe has been landed on a comet. Scientists at mission control in Germany hope the spider-like probe will send back data that could answer questions on the origin of Earth's water and perhaps even life. But they've warned that the landing should be seen as an 'exciting extra' on the Rosetta mission as the mission carries a 'high risk'. Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is currently travelling through space some 297 million miles (478 million km) from Earth. The relatively smooth landing region, identified for the moment simply by the letter 'J', is located on the smaller of the duck-shaped comet's two lobes. A further back up site has been chosen on the larger of 67P's lobes, and is currently being marked by Esa with the letter 'C'. 'As we have seen from recent close-up images, the comet is a beautiful but dramatic world - it is scientifically exciting, but its shape makes it operationally challenging,' Dr Stephan Ulamec, Philae Lander Manager, said earlier this month. 'None of the candidate landing sites met all of the operational criteria at the 100 per cent level, but Site J is clearly the best solution.' Rosetta took an incredible selfie of its 131ft (40 metre) solar wings gleaming against the darkness of space last week. In the background is the duck-shaped comet, Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, with its distinct 'head' and 'body' clearly visible . At Site J, the majority of slopes have an angle less than 30º, reducing the chances of Philae toppling over during touchdown. Site J also appears to have relatively few boulders, and receives sufficient daily sunlight to recharge Philae and continue science operations on the surface beyond the initial battery-powered phase. Site C was chosen as a backup because of more sunlight hours and fewer boulders. But even the flat surface chosen contains potentially dangerous boulders and cracks. These include a mysterious 'pyramid', in the words of Esa, named Cheops that was spotted on the surface of the comet earlier this week. At around 82ft-tall (25 metres), the structure is one of the larger boulders seen on the comet and could help scientists better understand its history. Boulder Cheops, taken by Rosetta's OSIRIS camera on 19 September , from a distance of 17.7 miles (28.5km) The 'pyramid' stood out among a group of boulders on the lower side of 67P/C-G's larger lobe - an area that has reminded scientists of the famous pyramids at Giza near Cairo in Egypt .","Esa has confirmed Rosetta will attempt to land on a comet on 12 November .

"Outraged: Professor Martha Shelby says she believes the sick passenger was racially profiled . A college professor is claiming that an American Airlines crew who feared Ebola locked a sick woman in an airplane bathroom after she vomited in the aisle. American Airlines is strongly denying the claim and said the crew never believed the ill passenger was suffering from the deadly disease - and that the traveled wanted to stay in the lavatory in case she was ill again. The incident happened on American Airlines Flight 2325 Thursday night from Dallas-Fort Worth to Chicago. University of Texas professor Martha Shelby told MailOnline she heard a flight attendant say to the woman: 'Because of our current health situation, we’re going to have to ask you to stay in the bathroom.' The cabin crew then cordoned off the back of the airplane with seat belt extenders. When the plane landed and the woman was carted off the plane by medics, flight attendants wrapped her carry-on luggage in plastic before sending it off the plane with her, professor Shelby, who is chair of the Asian studies department in Austin, said. She believes that because the ill woman was black, she was treated as if she had Ebola. 'I’m outraged. And some of my fellow passengers were, too. We just could not believe what we have seen... they thought it was about race, too,' she said. When the plane began to land, professor Shelby said, she heard a flight attendant tell the passenger in the lavatory: 'You’re going to have to stay in there, hang on tight.' The incident speaks to a growing fear that sick air travelers could be carrying Ebola. Passengers from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport to Yeager Airport in Charleston, West Virginia, have been hauled off planes by hazmat-clad officials after getting ill on board. So far, all of them have tested negative for the deadly disease. Today, Washington DC lobbyist Terry Thames caused a lock down of part of the Pentagon after she got ill and vomited outside the Defense Department offices. However, Dallas nurse Amber Vinson flew on two Frontier Airlines flights after being exposed to Ebola while treating 'patient zero' Thomas Eric Duncan. She was hospitalized with the disease just hours after flying from Cleveland to Dallas on Monday night. The incident happened on an American Airlines flight from Dallas-Fort Worth to Chicago on Thursday night . American Airlines spokeswoman Michelle Mohr said professor Shelby had 'absolutely the wrong reading' of the situation on the plane. Ms Mohr said the passenger became 'extremely, violently ill' and projectile vomited while waiting to get into a lavatory on the plane. Ebola was never mentioned. In fact, that flight attendants suspected the passenger had food poisoning. Ms Mohr also denied that the woman was locked in the bathroom. 'The passenger who was sick elected to go into lavatory and elected to remain there for the short duration of the flight. At no time was she ever locked in lavatory. elected to stay there,' Ms Mohr said.","College professor Martha Shelby says she is outraged by the treatment of the female passenger on Flight 2325 from Dallas to Chicago .

"Footballer Nicolas Anelka is facing a police investigation after he celebrated a goal with a ‘reverse Nazi salute’. The European Jewish Congress called for him to receive the same punishment that would be handed down for a Nazi salute, while a senior French politician said the gesture was ‘clearly anti-Semitic’. The 34-year-old West Bromwich Albion striker claimed he performed the gesture as a ‘special dedication’ for his comedian friend Dieudonne M’bala M’bala, who invented it. Scroll down for video . Investigation: The FA is continuing its investigation into the seriousness of Nicolas Anelka's goal celebration . Racist or harmless? The gesture made by West Brom striker Nicolas Anelka after scoring his first goal . France's sports minister took to Twitter tonight to condemn the Anelka's behaviour. Valerie Fourneyron said: 'Anti-Semitism and incitement to hatred have no place on a football field' French authorities have been debating whether the comic's performances should be banned, while anti-racism groups say it is regularly used to bait Jews. A spokesman for the Met Police said they take all allegations of hate crime seriously. The spokesman added: 'We will consider whether any police action is required after consultation and consideration of the circumstances. 'We are aware of the level of concern generated by any high profile incident and therefore take a proactive approach, working with our partners to establish what course of action is most appropriate.' But the striker's coach has stood by him saying claims that it was anti-Semitic are 'absolute rubbish'. West Brom coach Keith Downing said former French international Anelka was 'totally surprised' by the furore he had provoked. 'Racist': Comedian Dieudonne M'Bala M'Bala, who has been fined several times for defaming Jews . 'I'm aware of it but it has got nothing to do what is being said,' Downing replied when asked about the gesture. 'It . is dedicated to a French comedian he knows very, very well. He uses it . in his act and I think speculation can be stopped now, it is absolute . rubbish really. 'He is totally unaware of what the problems were or the speculation that has been thrown around, he is totally surprised by it.' An undated photo circulated on Twitter claims to show Anelka, a practicing Muslim, and 47-year-old Dieudonne making the gesture together. It comes after French Interior Minister Manuel . Valls said yesterday that he was considering banning Dieudonne's upcoming shows because they . regularly attack the memory of Holocaust victims. 'Dieudonne has been repeatedly convicted for defamation, insulting behaviour and incitement to racial hatred,' said Mr Valls. 'This is a repeat offender and I intend to act with the greatest firmness, under the law,' Mr Valls added. More . than 70,000 French Jews died during the Second World War, and Dieudonne . has been fined in France six times for defaming Jews. In 2008 he was fined the . equivalent of just over £6,000 for describing Holocaust remembrance . as 'memorial pornography'. The comedian insists that the gesture is anti-establishment, not anti-Semitic. Friends: West Brom acting head coach Keith Downing says that the gesture was a dedication from Anelka (right) to his French comedian friend Dieudonne (left) Dieudonne calls the gesture 'la quenelle' - the word for an elongated creamed fish dumpling - and says it stands for his anti-Zionist and anti-establishment views, not anti-Semitism. The gesture has gone viral on social media recently, with mostly young fans displaying it at parties and sports events. Some do it while in the audience at live television shows. Two soldiers were sanctioned by the army in September for making the gesture in uniform in front of a Paris synagogue. When Radio France's Patrick Cohen asked on air last week if the media should pay so much attention to him, Dieudonne suggested the journalist should get ready to emigrate. 'When I hear Patrick Cohen speaking, I say to myself, you see, the gas chambers ... too bad,' he said. However, Mr Valls added: 'Dieudonne M'bala M'bala doesn't seem to recognise any limits anymore. 'From . one comment to the next, as he has shown in several television shows, . he attacks the memory of Holocaust victims in an obvious and . unacceptable way.' The . 'quenelle' is a key component of the Dieudonne act, and he has himself . threatened to sue those who object to it. Dieudonne is particularly critical of Israel's occupation of Palestine territories. A Paris-born son of a . Cameroonian father and French mother, he began his comedy career with a . Jewish sidekick in the early 1990s and appeared in several films. Originally . active with anti-racist left-wing groups, he began openly criticizing . Jews and Israel in 2002 and ran in the European elections two years . later with a pro-Palestinian party. Police broke . up his one-man-show in a Brussels theatre last year for suspected . anti-Semitic hate speech, but he was not convicted. France's sports minister took to Twitter tonight to condemn the Anelka's behaviour. Valerie Fourneyron said: 'Anti-Semitism and incitement to hatred have no place on a football field.' Roger . Cukierman, president of the Paris-based council of French Jewish . organisations, the CRIF, said of the comedian: 'It's the Nazi salute in reverse. Very . clearly, Mr Dieudonne is developing a nearly professional anti-Semitism . under the cover of telling jokes.' Doubling up: Anelka (left) is on the spot to score West Brom's second goal of the afternoon . Anelka could face punishment in France if his actions can be shown to be offensive, insulting, abusive or political.

"It is a medical marvel Jack Martindale made it to this interview. The 25-year-old has, like many others, just completed a bachelors degree and started the process of working out what to do next. But less than five years ago, in the early hours of New Year’s Day 2010, he was in a coma, his skull shattered into 30 pieces after he and his friends were hit by a car that had careered off the road. Horrific: Jack Martindale, 25, pictured left this year, less than five years after he was slammed into a coma, right, by a speeding driver in the early hours of New Year's Day 2010, leaving him with permanent brain damage . Tragic: Jack, pictured months before  with love interest Chelsea Cannon, who never awoke from her coma . The crash near London’s north circular killed his 20-year-old friend Carrie Maclaren instantly. His new love interest, Chelsea Cannon, 19, never woke up from her coma. For more than three months doctors repeatedly warned his parents that Jack would probably wake up but could never lead an independent life. On a scale of one to 15, his coma was rated three: the lowest point at which you have a chance of survival. He suffered a diffuse axonal head injury, which left him with severe amnesia and ataxia, which affects muscle coordination and speech. At first - before a grueling five-hour operation to replace his skull with nine titanium plates and 33 screws - Jack's injuries had also completely altered his appearance. Incredibly, after a bitter legal battle and years of intensive therapy, he has a degree, his own place and has written a book about his journey battling a brain injury. Still, it is a struggle to describe the moment he came to. ‘I thought that I must just be having some vivid nightmare,’ he told MailOnline. ‘Although I cannot definitively know how long this lasted, I refused to believe that my situation had really occurred for well over six months.’ Carefree: Then aged 21, Jack had been in his final year of an English degree at the University of York. He was leaving a party with Chelsea, their friend Carrie and two others in Barnet, north London, when they were hit . Before: Jack, pictured months before the accident, said he was in denial for months after the crash . Travels: Jack traveled to Malawi (pictured) and India during his holidays from university before the accident . Devastation: Doctors warned his parents Jack would never be able to lead an independent life when he awoke . Jack woke up in April 2010, unable to walk, talk, or eat. He had no idea how old he was and was shocked that his parents were so young. When doctors tried to test his memory, he could only identify objects in French. Almost immediately, his parents - classroom assistant Jo, 56, and shipping lawyer Bill, 57 - delivered the crushing news that Chelsea and Carrie were dead. 'Words failed me,' Jack explains. 'I was utterly devastated. 'It must have been incredibly difficult for people to have told me the news and luckily my parents always dismissed the view that they shouldn't tell me about Chelsea and Carrie's deaths. 'I had begun to ask the questions and if they'd kept things from me, I'd feel betrayal and massive lasting resentment.' Shattered: This is Jack's x-ray showing how his skull was shattered into 30 pieces. A surgeon dedicated himself to rebuilding Jack's face using nine titanium plates and 33 metal screws in a five-hour operation . Jack had been on the cusp of completing his English degree at the University of York after three years of study. But the accident changed everything. However, after defying expectations by surviving the crash, he was determined to get his life back on track. He started with nine months at the Queen Elizabeth Foundation (QEF), a neurological rehabilition centre in Surrey, where he started constructing plans to return to York, prosecute the driver that killed his two friends, and reclaim his rightful compensation. ‘I had a robust desire to prove myself,' he said. 'This need to validate myself has long relented along with more painfully accepting gradually that a brain injury shall always exist as something for me to have to work around.' It started with a bitter legal battle - first to convict the driver Shamail Ali Syed, who was found guilty of two counts of deaths by dangerous driving and jailed for seven years. Then Jack had to endure a fight to prove to the Court of Protection that he was mentally fit to control his own compensation money, which Syed was ordered to pay. The controversial system has jurisdiction over the property, financial affairs and personal welfare of people who it claims lack mental capacity to make decisions for themselves. But negotiating to reclaim his money, Jack discovered, was no simple process. 'Paradox is a word that I use frequently throughout my book and the Court of Protection is an ultimate example of this; it’s acting in your interest, but getting full control of your money returned is an arduous process. 'With the assistance of the QEF, I was removed from the Court of Protection at some point in 2011 after a lengthy process of proving that I was fit to handle my own money.’ The payment was released in 2011 as Jack decided he was finally ready complete the bachelors degree he started in 2007. Jack is not short of compliments for the University of York, which provided him with a library assistant, an English supervisor, and neurological support to reach his qualification. 'The University of York were fantastic at accommodating my return to studies. 'Learning the futility of trying to recapture my own glorified university experience was tricky at first. 'Ultimately I think that I underestimated the fact that completing an English and Politics degree from the University of York is no walk in the park. 'Once I made a tight group of friends that were disconnected from the university and did my degree over a part-time basis, things became good again!' He has now written a book detailing his experiences as clearly as he can remember. But that night remains a blank in his mind. ‘As I suffered from severe amnesia and the entirety of New Year 2010 continues to be a haze, writing about that was impossible. 'Still I have blurry visions of many moments that could have be recollections from our night, but can’t be sure which are just figments of my imagination or based on prompts from evidence or things that I’ve been told.’ It is a major professional and personal landmark that few people in full health could contemplate. The release of Battling A Brain Injury: The Life That Jack Built, which has been months in the making, gives him something of a boost as he nears the five-year mark. Success: Jack, pictured with his mother Jo, was determined to finish his studies and last year was awarded a 2:1 for his bachelor's degree in English and Politics at the University of York, where he is still based today . Looking forward: Having now written a book about his experiences, Jack has defied doctors' expectations . But he speaks candidly about the everyday torment he faces simply looking at his tracheotomy scar - which he has colloquially dubbed his ‘trackey’. ‘Scars slap me in the face whenever I look at photographs and obviously whether I have predominantly pride or… Shame isn’t the right word, although there is at times a significant amount of discomfort having this scar. ‘Sometimes it’s a source of pride and other times I just fail to believe that this is me. ‘It is what it is, no choice in the matter.’ In a choking blog post, he writes: 'The bitter irony is that I do not even want to identify particularly with those who’d be able to relate to my situation; everything about the state that I have been left within is something that I have desperately urged to veer away from. 'There are certainly optimistic things that have arisen as a result of the catastrophic accident that I was involved in, only I’ve moved beyond believing that they can ever balance out my horrific ordeals.'","Jack Martindale, 25, was hit by a car in early hours of New Year's Day 2010 .

"Lewis Hamilton may have grumbled about his Mercedes in practice for Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix, but he still managed to again outpace his rivals. 'Something's not right with this car,' moaned Hamilton late in the second 90-minute session at a chilly Shanghai International Circuit where temperatures only managed to reach 16 degrees centigrade. Regardless, Hamilton, winner of the last two races in Malaysia and Bahrain, topped the timesheet for the third time in the four Friday outings this season, finishing with a lap of one minute 38.315secs. On track: Lewis Hamilton was fastest in the second practice session for the Chinese Grand Prix . Life in the fast lane: Hamilton carried over his good form from Malaysia and Bahrain to the Chinese Grand Prix . Head boy: Hamilton, trails Nico Rosberg by 11 points in the championship, but was fastest on Friday . Remarkably, it was not Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg who was out in front with the Briton on this occasion as Ferrari's Fernando Alonso managed to split the duo. With Marco Mattiacci in town on the first day of his new job as team principal of Ferrari, Alonso chose the perfect opportunity to prove the Prancing Horse is alive and kicking this season. Just 12 days ago Alonso crossed the finishing line at the end of the race in Bahrain sarcastically punching the air in delight following a ninth-place finish, with team-mate Kimi Raikkonen 10th. That came on the day president Luca Di Montezemolo visited the paddock for the first time this season, and he was naturally left far from impressed. Welcome along: Ferrari's new team principal, Marco Mattiacci arrives at the Shaghai paddock on Friday . On track: Fernando Alonso was fastest in the morning before finishing behind only Hamilton later on Friday . Eight days later, and Stefano Domenicali announced his resignation as team principal, ending just over six seasons in charge, during which time Ferrari collected only one trophy. In Domenicali's place, Di Montezemolo has seemingly made an unusual appointment in Mattiacci as the 43-year-old has no experience of F1, although is understood to be a skilled manager given his previous role as president and CEO of Ferrari North America. With Mattiacci in the paddock, wearing sunglasses throughout despite the leaden skies over the track, Alonso was quickest in FP1 and only 0.141secs behind Hamilton in FP2. Championship leader Rosberg, 11 points clear of Hamilton, was four tenths of a second adrift, followed closely by Daniel Ricciardo in his Red Bull. Raring to go: Daniel Ricciardo was fourth quickest during the second practice session in Shanghai . Short of pace: Sebastian Vettel . The Australian, eager to put behind him the team's failed appeal this week against his disqualification from the season-opening race in Australia, was 0.496secs down. Notably, Ricciardo was again ahead of reigning four-time champion team-mate Sebastian Vettel who was exactly seven tenths of a second down. Williams' Felipe Massa and Kimi Raikkonen in his Ferrari were sixth and seventh quickest, both inside a second of Hamilton. The Finn, who had been consigned to the garage for all but one installation lap in FP1 due to a technical problem, at least managed 25 laps in FP2. McLaren's Jenson Button, the Lotus of Romain Grosjean and Toro Rosso of Daniel Kvyat completed the top 10, all just over a second down on Hamilton. There was embarrassment for the second Lotus driven by Pastor Maldonado, however, as he crashed on the entry lane into the pits. It is an area that has occasionally caught out some in the past, most notably in 2007 when Lewis Hamilton slid off and beached his car in the gravel when he had that year's world title in his grasp. Venezuelan Maldonado was simply returning to the pits, but with too much speed as he ran across the gravel and into the tyre wall. Marussia's Max Chilton, who has so far finished all 22 of the grands prix in which he has competed, was down in 20th, with both Caterhams behind him.","Lewis Hamilton, winner in Malaysia and Bahrain, was quickest in Friday's second practice session for the Chinese Grand Prix .

The new campaign film is set against a theatrical London backdrop, which comes alive with over 50 dancers who give a performance inspired by the golden age of cinematic musicals. The story captures a boy delivering the gift of love to a young couple, played by new British models and dancers Hannah Dodds and Anders Hayward, and aims to celebrate gifting as the ultimate symbol of a connection between people. Shot on location at a custom-designed set on the George Lucas stage at Elstree Studios in London, the dancers perform to choreography by Lynne Page, specially designed for the exclusive campaign soundtrack ‘The Way that I Live’.

"A ballroom and Latin dancer who will never compete again after a hit-and-run has blasted police who dropped her case to due a lack of evidence. Helen Ansell, 20, had to have four operations - including a metal plate in her left leg - after breaking her leg and ankle in the crash in Nottingham, where she studies at university. She spent three weeks in intensive care with broken metatarsals in her foot and a six-inch gash in her calf while police traced the car suspected of hitting her and arrested two men. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Anger: Helen Ansell, a talented Latin and ballroom dancer, has been told she will never dance again after a hit-and-run driver left her for dead - and has now blasted police who closed her case due to lack of evidence . Injuries: Miss Ansell had to have four operations and a metal plate put in her left leg (pictured) after the crash . But they have now released the men and closed the case, saying there is not enough evidence to bring a successful prosecution. The English literature student at Nottingham University was crossing the road in Lenton, Nottingham, at 4.30pm on March 7 when she was hit by a BMW and left for dead. 'The driver didn’t even try to stop and was gone before anyone knew it', she said. 'I was halfway across and then saw a car speeding down the road really fast, so I began to run to get out the way. 'I didn’t make it in time though, and before I knew it I was knocked flying in the air and thrown under a car. Recovery: Miss Ansell is still having to study part-time, and will not return to her degree full-time until January . 'I was in absolute agony. I can’t explain the pain that I felt, and the fact I didn’t pass out until 2am meant I felt every bit of it. 'I thought the police would find them, but now I just have to hope someone else saw it happen. 'I hate the fact the people responsible are walking around without a care and I am facing another two years of rehabilitation before I will get to the best I will ever be - whatever that is. It is really unjust.' The crash meant Miss Ansell has had to stay for another year of university because she had to take six months off her studies to recover. She is still studying part-time and doctors say she will not be in lectures again full-time until January. The former talented Latin and ballroom dancer was also told she will never dance again. Left for dead: Miss Ansell was crossing this road in Nottingham in the middle of the afternoon in March . She said: 'There have been plenty of tough days, but I can walk again. I am lucky as I have heard of these things ending up much worse.' A spokeswoman from Nottinghamshire Police said: 'Despite a full and thorough investigation there is insufficient evidence to progress the case any further. 'Two men were arrested in connection with the offence but were released with no further action. If any further evidence comes to light we can review this.' Sally Green, 45, a close friend of Miss Ansell’s mother who died of cancer in 2009, said she was 'absolutely shocked' by the decision. She said: 'She has been amazing how she has got through it. She just wants someone to be brought to justice for what she has been through.'","Helen Ansell, 20, told she would never dance again after crash in March .

"Felines may enjoy the sound of a tin of cat food being prised open, but now they can listen to moggy music too. Scientists have created the world’s first keyboard for cats which plays notes at ultrasonic frequencies that cats can hear. A team of vets, scientists and sounds artists engineered the electric baby grand piano, which has been used to play the first ever concert for cats, in south east London. Scroll down for video . A pur-fect composition? Scientists have created the world’s first keyboard for cats (pictured) which plays notes at ultrasonic frequencies that cats can hear. In this image, musical moggies attend a concert for kitties . Felines were treated to ultrasonic renditions of Jay Z’s ‘Empire State of Mind’ and The Backstreet Boys’ ‘I Want It That Way’ as well as the soundtrack to Back to the Future. Ultrasound is an oscillating sound pressure wave with a frequency greater than the upper limit of the human hearing range, which is typically around 20,000 hertz (Hz) for healthy humans. The music was played at frequencies of up to 64,000Hz, the higher ranges of which only cats can aurally appreciate. Moggie Mozarts? Some cats enjoyed the music so much that they leapt onto the keyboard and wandered over the keys to make their own melodies (pictured) Feline groovy: Cats were treated to ultrasonic renditions of Jay Z’s ‘Empire State of Mind’ and The Backstreet Boys’ ‘I Want It That Way’ as well as the soundtrack to Back to the Future at the concert (pictured). It was put on as part of a viral protest against countries that it says censor the internet . Cats can hear ultrasonic frequencies - those that are beyond the upper limit of the human hearing range. The average healthy human can hear noises up to 20,000Hz, whereas cats can hear up to 64,000Hz. They can hear 11 octaves - two more than a human and one more than a dog. When listening for something, a cat's ears will swivel in that direction to target within three inches (7.5cm) a sound being made from one yard (91cm) away. They use this skill to accurately hunt prey. Some cats enjoyed the music so much that they leapt onto the keyboard and wandered over the keys to play their own tunes. The keyboard has also been designed to play sounds that human ears pick up upon while the ultrasonic sounds are playing, so that pet owners - and the pianist - don’t get bored. ‘A cat’s hearing really is something to behold,’ said vet Robert White-Adams said. ‘Behind those big, pointed, funnel-like ears is an incredibly complex auditory apparatus that can detect a larger range of sounds. ‘An impressive 11 octaves, to be precise, which is two octaves more than a human, and one octave more than a dog. ‘While research has suggested cats do enjoy music, this keyboard for cats will give felines the opportunity to enjoy their favourite compositions.’ The keyboard for cats was made as part of the viral protest, ‘The Pussycat Riot,’ which campaigns against countries such as Russia and China that it says censor the internet. Listening to the mew-sic: The songs was played at frequencies of up to 64,000hz (pictured left), the higher ranges of which only cats can aurally appreciate (right) An album for cats is available to the public and includes the ultrasonic feline-friendly versions of national anthems belonging to internet-censoring countries. The track list reads: . 1. China - Yiyongjun Jinxingqu (‘March of the Volunteers’) 2. Iran - Mehre Khavaran (‘Eastern Sun’) 3. North Korea - Aegukka (‘Patriotic Song’) 4. Turkey - Istiklal Marsi (‘Independence March’) 5. Russia - Gosudarstvenny Gimn Rossiyskoy Federatsii (‘State Anthem of the Russian Federation’) 6. Saudi Arabia - an-Nasid al-Wataniyy (‘The National Anthem’) 7. Vietnam - Tien Quan Ca (‘The Marching Song’) 8. Cuba - El Himno de Bayamo (‘The Bayamo Anthem’) 9. Myanmar - Kaba Ma Kyei (‘Till the End of the World’) The campaign aims to break this censorship and uses cats to front the protest because of their popularity on the internet. The keyboard was commissioned by HideMyAss.com which gives access to people being banned from the web. The concert was called ‘protest concerto’ and the pianist performed the national anthems from each of the internet censoring countries. Pop songs were also chosen that have been banned by these countries online. ‘Cats have a vastly superior sense of hearing to humans,’ said Cian McKenna-Charley, Marketing Director at HideMyAss.com. ‘They’re also known for being intelligent animals with quite discerning personalities. ‘If they were human they’d probably be connoisseurs of classical music and delight in pursuits like poetry, gastronomy and international affairs. ‘We felt it was high time the cat’s superior sensibilities were catered to properly. ‘This keyboard for cats is as much an homage to the original internet cat as it is a political statement against internet censorship. ‘It’s one we hope people will want to talk about, share with their friends and use to spread the word that online censorship needs to end now.' A CD of ultrasonic music for cats will be available, featuring the national anthems belonging to internet-censoring countries, such as North Korea, Turkey, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Cuba, for example. Roll over Beethoven: Cats can detect a larger range of sounds than dogs an humans. ‘An impressive 11 octaves, to be precise, which is two octaves more than a human, and one octave more than a dog, vet Robert White-Adams said .","Piano hits ultrasonic notes as high as 64,000hz, which humans can't hear .

"Game-breaking fullback Israel Folau's huge value to rugby union has been underlined after he beat warm favourite and Wallabies captain Michael Hooper for the John Eales Medal on Thursday. In just his second year in the 15-a-side code, Folau has added to an impressive tally of rugby union awards, by winning one voted on by his fellow Wallabies. After less than two years playing rugby union, Folau's peers voted him the best player in Australian rugby. Folau's award comes during an enormous week for Australian Rugby, with the resignation of coach Ewen McKenzie and the appointment of his replacement,  NSW Waratahs' coach Michael Cheika. McKenzie's announcement came immediately after the Wallabies' one-point, final minute loss to New Zealand. His resignation followed weeks of controversy, with Kurtley Beale suspended and facing two separate misconduct hearings. Wallabies fullback Israel Folau has won the John Eales Medal. The award is voted by his fellow Wallabies, electing the team's best player . Folau's only been playing union for 2 years following stints in AFL & NRL but polled 314 votes to finish clear of Wallabies captain Michael Hooper . Folau polled 314 votes to finish clear of openside flanker Michael Hooper (232), who was widely tipped to become the first player in the 14-year history of the medal to win it in successive years. The two Waratahs shared the Super Rugby player of the year award, while Hooper was named Australia's Choice player of the year. In the John Eales Medal, prop James Slipper (208) was third, just ahead of centre Tevita Kuridrani (202). Folau is only the fourth back in 14 years to win the medal after Chris Latham (2006), Matt Giteau (2009), and Kurtley Beale (2011). Folau's award comes during an enormous week for Australian Rugby, with the resignation of coach Ewen McKenzie and the appointment of his replacement, NSW Waratahs' coach Michael Cheika . The medal is voted for by the Wallabies on a 3-2-1 basis after each Test over the past 12 months, from last year's spring tour to last weekend's Bledisloe Cup Test. Prolific tryscoring Folau comes off contract at the end of next year and has never ruled out moving back to rugby league, where he started his stellar professional career. Folau 25, has scored 15 tries in 25 Tests, and his tally of 10 in 2013 equalled the most in a year by a Wallaby, set by another former rugby league star, Lote Tuqiri. In 2013, Folau also won the Super Rugby rookie and Australian Rugby Players' Association and International Rugby Players' Association's newcomer of the year awards. Australia's late defeat to New Zealand forced coach Ewen McKenzie to resign before European Tour . New South Wales Waratahs boss Michael Cheika has replaced Ewen McKenzie as Australia's head coach . McKenzie (above) announced his departure at a press conference immediately after the defeat . Lock Sam Carter, who debuted against France in June and has played eight Tests, was named Wallabies rookie of the year. New Wallabies head coach Michael Cheika won the Australian Super Rugby coach of the year after steering the NSW Waratahs to their maiden title, which earned them the Australian Super Rugby team of the year. Folau apart, the big winner of the awards night at Sydney's Randwick Racecourse was Melbourne Rebels flanker Sean McMahon, who took out three awards. All Blacks centre Malakai Fekitoa crashes over in the final minute as New Zealand snatch a late victory . Malakai Fekitoa celebrates as his late try hands New Zealand a 29-28 victory over Australia . Uncapped McMahon, who was named on Wednesday in the Wallabies spring tour squad, won the Australian U20s player of the Year; the National Rugby Championship Player of the series; and the Super Rugby rookie of the Year. Emilee Cherry won the awards for women's player of the year in both sevens and 15-a-side, while Cameron Clark was named male sevens player of the year. 'It's a huge honour and a privilege to be on the list with so many great players who have worn this John Eales Medal,' Folau said. 'There's so many great players in the team that could have won this award. 'But without an overall team performance, I wouldn't have achieved this award. 'It's huge to be voted by your peers and I hold that in high regard. 'This is definitely up there with all the awards and accolades that I've achieved across all the different codes that I've played. 'It's my second year in rugby, but I'm thoroughly enjoying my time. 'For me, the next thing is going across to Europe for the next five weeks and trying to get a job done.' Folau welcomed the appointment of Michael Cheika as new Wallabies coach, ranking him alongside his rugby league mentors Craig Bellamy and Mal Meninga. He hoped Waratahs and Wallabies teammate Kurtley Beale would return to the team environment after his hearing on Friday.","Wallabies fullback Israel Folau has won the John Eales Medal .

"Determined D.A.: Tom Sneddon, seen here during the 2005 trial against Michael Jackson, died on Saturday at the age of 73 . Tom Sneddon, the former district attorney who sought twice to try Michael Jackson on child molestation charges and was disparaged in one of the pop star's songs, has died. Sneddon, aged 73, died Saturday at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital after a battle with cancer, said Patrick McKinley, a retired assistant district attorney for Santa Barbara County. Sneddon investigated Michael Jackson on child sexual abuse allegations in 1993 and again a decade later. The first case fell apart after a young boy's family accepted a multimillion dollar settlement from Jackson and declined to testify against him. The probe closed with no charges. Jackson shot back in a thinly disguised swipe at the prosecutor in a song called 'D.S.' on the 'HIStory' album. The song contains the lyrics, 'Dom Sheldon is a cold man.' A second set of allegations against Jackson made by a young cancer survivor resulted in a televised trial in 2005 which ended with Jackson being acquitted. Jackson's defense attorney, Thomas Mesereau Jr., painted Sneddon as an overzealous prosecutor who had a 'personal vendetta' against Jackson after the first case fell apart. Sneddon continued to insist that he believed Jackson could be a danger to children and said he would have considered a conviction tragic, considering Jackson's accomplishments. Doubts still linger: Jackson, at his 2005 hearing, always denied allegations he molested children at his Neverland Ranch in Los Olivos near Santa Barbara, but he allegedly paid one family $20 million to end a case . In a thinly disguised swipe at the prosecutor on the 'HIStory' album Jackson sang  'Dom Sheldon is a cold man' 'If he had been convicted I think that part of it would have been a tragedy — like a Greek tragedy play of a person who obviously can bring great joy and entertainment to the people around the world, (who was) obviously a great entertainer at one point in his career, (who) could end up this way for whatever reason,' he told the Associated Press in an interview after the verdict. Sneddon retired in 2006. Joyce Dudley, Santa Barbara County's current district attorney, said Sneddon's expectations of his prosecutors were always clear. 'Be the most prepared person in the courtroom, work smart, work hard, step right up to the line but never over it,' she said. 'I don't think you will find a prosecutor in the district attorney's office who worked for him who has one bad thing to say about him. He was just a helluva boss,' said McKinley, who worked with Sneddon for more than three decades. 'He wasn't afraid to make a decision,' he said. 'He would make a decision and away we'd go.' McKinley said he learned of Sneddon's death from Sneddon's wife. Sneddon is survived by his wife and nine children, McKinley said.

"Animal rights activists will renew their battle this week to prove a chimpanzee is a 'person' in the eyes of the law. The main player in the landmark case is a little different from most - he is Tommy, a 26-year-old former circus chimp who allegedly lives in a cage on a trailer park in New York state. This week judges will hear how the self-knowledge, memory and emotions that make Tommy so much like humans should give him the same fundamental rights we enjoy. I wanna be like you: Animal rights activists are renewing their battle to prove Tommy (pictured) is a 'person' The case is being led by activists for the Nonhuman Rights Project, whose leaders include the renowned British primate expert Jane Goodall. They are suing the animal's owner and have submitted a 65-page document to New York's Appeals Court insisting Tommy is granted 'personhood'. They say that would grant the animal a 'right over his own body' and allow them to move him to a sanctuary. Natalie Prosin, executive director of the Nonhuman Rights Project, told MailOnline: 'It hasn't been tried before so our case is unique. 'It's the first time any organisation has tried to get actual legal rights for any non-humans - under U.S. law animals count as things, not people. Big name: The plans are backed by renowned British primate expert Dr Jane Goodall (pictured in 1974) 'There are animal protection laws but that's not the same as giving rights to animals. At the moment they're just the same as a table or a chair.' She insisted being a person under the law was 'not the same as human rights'. 'The legal term ""legal person"" is not synonymous with human beings', she said. 'Corporations can be legal persons in the U.S. 'What we're trying to do is have the court grant legal person rights so our chimpanzee plaintiff can enjoy one simple human right. Jane Goodall is a director of the project. Another said Tommy was 'the same as a table or a chair' 'The last time we saw him he was in a cage in a shed on a trailer park. He basically lives in solitary confinement.' The campaigners face an uphill struggle. Tommy's owner has previously hit back at the case, saying the animal is perfectly well cared-for. And the case was previously knocked down by a lower court, which rejected four bids for 'body liberty' - for Tommy and three other chimps, Kiko, Hercules and Leo. Ms Prosin added: 'If we lose, we won't stop. We will appeal to New York's highest court.' The group chose a chimpanzee because the animals are among our closest relatives in the natural kingdom, sharing more than 90 per cent of DNA with humans. But if they win the case on Wednesday, their ambitions go beyond chimpanzees - and they want to create 'person rights' for other animals species by species. The campaigners' dossier contains references to reams of studies which establish how similar chimpanzees are to their human relatives. They add: 'New York common liberty and equality principles compel this Court to recognise Tommy's personhood and fundamental right to bodily integrity.' The case has echoes of the so-called 'monkey selfie', which made headlines when photographer David Slater insisted he owned a picture taken by an ape on his camera while he was on a shoot. U.S. copyright authorities felt differently - and said the photograph was anyone's to use for free. They did, however, stop short of granting the monkey the copyright. The New York State Court of Appeals will hear the case on Wednesday and is expected to give its judgement within the next two months.","Tommy, an ex-circus chimp, lives in cage on trailer park near New York .

"Nepalese tour guides killed when a blizzard struck a Himalayan trekking route were wearing trainers and even flip flops when they froze to death. Few of the local workers, who earn as little as £9 a day as porters, had warm coats or boots to protect them from the freezing storm, said Captain Adhikari of the Nepalese Army. At least 41 people were killed last week when a blizzard and avalanches swept the mountains of the Annapurna region in northern Nepal. Twenty were Nepalese guides, porters and villagers. Sad: Grieving relatives of snowstorm and an avalanche victims wait outside the Teaching Hospital morgue in Kathmandu. An army captain who took part in the rescue said Nepalese porters and guides were ill-equipped . A woman sobs as she waits to pick up a body:  Twenty of the dead were Nepalese guides, porters and villager . Some of the dead may not be found until the snows thaw next spring, authorities said. Captain Adhikari, the Nepalese Army's top rescuer, led more than 70 hikers to safety after the storm - and personally recovered the bodies of 25. He told Dean Nelson, who was in Jomsom, Nepal, for the Daily Telegraph: 'The worst thing was [seeing] the equipment and gear of the Nepali porters and guides because it meant they were dead, but they were not well-equipped. 'The Nepalis I saw were wearing normal dress, some of them in slippers, some had coats and some didn’t. They did not have proper clothes or protection from the snow...this could be a factor in why so many Nepalis died.' Baburam Bhandari, the Nepal government’s chief district officer in charge of the rescue effort, echoed his comments. 'Porters had no trekking shoes or coats,' he said. 'They were in sports shoes and normal clothes because they’re poor - it is one of the causes of their deaths. Some of them died because they were too cold - it was freezing snow, five or six feet deep' Today Nepalese officials said they will introduce new rules to try to make sure the disaster will not be repeated. Tourism Department official Tulasi Gautam said trekkers venturing to mountain trails will be required to take trained local guides, and will have to rent a GPS tracking unit to help authorities trace them in case of an emergency. Mr Gautam said the government plans to announce the new rules nationwide before the next trekking season in the spring. 'The main reason for the high number of casualties is that those trekkers without proper guides were prompted to continue with their trek in attempts to beat the storm. So we plan to strictly enforce new rules of no trekking without porters or proper guides,' Mr Gautam said. Many of the trekkers around the Annapurna Circuit trekking route are independent hikers generally called backpackers who do not hire guides. The route is also dotted with lodges and tea stalls that sell food, snacks and lodging. Authorities also plan to improve the weather forecasting system and make it easier to deliver information to remote trekking routes. A Nepalese Army helicopter rescues survivors along the Annapurna trail. There have been conflicting reports over exactly how many remain missing following the avalanche that killed at least 40 people . The government also said all trekkers must now register at check posts while entering and exiting the trekking areas. Previously, foreign trekkers were required to buy permits or at least register before entering trekking areas, but Nepalese nationals were not. And no one was required to check out when they left. Home Ministry Secretary Surya Prasad Silwal said rescuers were able to fly 518 stranded trekkers, including 310 foreigners, to safety before the search operation ended Monday. 'It was the biggest rescue operation in Nepal that included hundreds of soldiers, policemen and local officials. Swift response saved many lives,' Silwal said. He added that every available helicopter was used in the effort.","Nepalese army captain said some guides and porters had no coats .

President Obama said in a statement: 'Today our prayers go out to the people of West, Texas in the aftermath of last night’s deadly explosion at a fertilizer plant. A tight-knit community has been shaken, and good, hard-working people have lost their lives. 'I want to thank the first responders who worked tirelessly through the night to contain the situation and treat the wounded.  My Administration, through FEMA and other agencies, is in close contact with our state and local partners on the ground to make sure there are no unmet needs as search and rescue and response operations continue. 'West is a town that many Texans hold near and dear to their hearts, and as residents continue to respond to this tragedy, they will have the support of the American people.' Texas Governor Rick Perry tweeted, 'Thoughts and prayers with everyone in West, TX. Thx to all the first responders on the scene.'

"Emergency workers have played down fears of a toxic air leak following the fertilizer plant explosion in West, Texas. Initially reports suggested the farming community would be under a secondary danger of inhaling ammonia fumes which can cause respiratory problems. However, Waco police chief Patrick Swanton, who is leading the operation on behalf of the town of West which is 20 miles away, says he now believes that danger has been mitigated. Scroll down for video . Chemical fire: Firefighters initially feared a noxious cloud of ammonia spreading over West, Texas. Police say now say the leak is under control . Air pollution: A cloud of fumes can be seen rising from the massive explosion at a fertilizer plant in the US state of Texas which flattened several buildings . According to Popular Science Anhydrous ammonia is a widely used form of fertilizer. It is compressed into a clear, . colorless liquid and stored at extremely low temperatures and stored in tanks- When injected into the soil it  'is a potent way of making the soil more fertile' - Once outside it reverts to its natural gas state so it can be inhaled causing damage to the lungs . - The 'anhydrous' portion of its name means 'without water' and refers to the fact that it . reacts with water. It is dangerous to humans when it makes contact with water in the body like in the lungs and eyes . - Anyone suffering from ammonia irritation will need to flush the area with water to dilute the chemical . - Untreated in large quantities it can damage lung lining which is incredibly dangerous and can lead to death . - The website says the gas wouldn't have been the cause of the fire but would have exacerbated an initial blaze leading to the explosion. According to reports there was 54,000 pounds of it at the plant in West . 'The town is secure. There are plenty of law enforcement officials that are stationed around the town,' Swanton said. 'There is no fire out of control. There is no chemical escape from the fertilizer plant that is out of control.' 'Air quality, at this point, is not an issue. It is not a concern.' Last night authorities were concerned about a possible gas cloud creeping across the area from the blaze. The U.S. Chemical Safety Board deployed a 'large investigation team' to the scene and The Texas Commission of Environmental Quality began monitoring air in the area. Gov. Rick Perry said the air was being constantly monitored and gas distribution has been disconnected. 'We are … gathering information as details continue to emerge about this incident,' he said. 'We have also mobilized state resources to help local authorities. Our thoughts and prayers are with the people of West, and the first responders on the scene.' Locals reported a strong chemical smell after last night's explosion which occurred just before 8pm and doctors reported some people had irritated eyes and respiratory issues as a result of the fumes.

"Lynda Bellingham poignantly described the details of the Christmas she would never see during her final TV interview which was screened today. The actress had hoped to spend one more festive season with her family after choosing to end treatment for her cancer, but died at the weekend just days after she had made her decision public. In the interview for Loose Women - the show on which she had been a regular panellist - she assured friends and colleagues all would be 'fine' and said she wanted to be remembered for her honesty. Scroll down for video . In an interview  filmed two weeks ago, Lynda Bellingham  told of her desire to spend one final Christmas with her family before she stopped chemotherapy . The interview with presenters Janet Street Porter (left) and Coleen Nolan (centre), in which Lynda told of her plans to end her treatment, was filmed just days before her death . Presenters told of their shock at Lynda's death today, insisting that she looked full of energy when she filmed the interview two weeks ago . Bellingham died in the arms of her husband Michael Pattemore at the age of 66 after her cancer spread from her colon to other parts of her body. She recorded her last interview earlier this month and told how she was 'obsessed' with Christmas and was determined to see one more. 'Bloody right I am! I am. I AM,' she insisted, during the interview with Janet Street Porter and Coleen Nolan in front of a studio audience which included Pattemore. 'We're going to go to the hotel and have the meal but just my little bit of control - we're going home for pudding and presents, it's exciting. 'My only problem is getting the presents - my sister Jean has been absolutely amazing and I keep sending him (Michael) out for bizarre things.' Bellingham told of her desire for a real Christmas tree, although her husband was not a fan. 'He's spent years trying to put me off a real tree and we're very lucky as we live in a converted psychiatric hospital which has got a really tall ceiling. All I've ever wanted is a real tree. 'No don't make me sweep up the pine needles, oh my goodness',' she joked, mimicking Pattemore. 'Hey I'm getting one, I'm getting a real tree. He'll just have to struggle out of the window with it afterwards, that's fine.' At the end of the interview, the  studio audience and the two presenters rose to give  Lynda a standing ovation . The interview was shown today on a special tribute show in which presenters (left to right) Ruth Langsford, Coleen Nolan and Jamelia read out comments praising Lynda sent in by viewers . Coleen was overcome with emotion while watching the interview and had to leave the set during filming . Bellingham was given a standing ovation as she entered the studio and went on to say how she wished to be remembered: 'Just as an honest person. Honesty. We've been through this as Loose Women - you can't do Loose Women unless you're honest. 'You can't hide anything, it really is honest when we answer questions. That's why I felt I could write about it and people would trust.' 'Trust is a huge thing. Not just as an actor, not just as a lover, not just as a wife, that trust thing. Just to say you could trust her. As you know I wanted to win an oscar at 75 for Best Newcomer! Sadly that's gone out of the window.' Talking about her memoir There's Something I've Been Dying To Tell You, which was released less than a fortnight ago, Bellingham said: 'This book is for everyone, if one person who feels on their own - you do feel alone - and it's very hard to take onboard, obviously it's taken us a year to absorb it. But once you do, instead of worrying about dying, you must enjoy the bits in between.' She explained it had been difficult to adjust to scaling back her acting work following her diagnosis, and talked about how she was looking forward to filming a TV role in BBC1's The Syndicate next month. The actress - best known as the star of the Oxo adverts - joked about her husband, Michael (right), not wanting a real Christmas tree because he'd have to sweep up the needles . Michael, who sat in the audience during the interview, fought back the tears as she talked about her illness . Lynda said: 'Work stopped and that was really hard - 45 years I've worked and it was all whipped away from me, especially the play A Passionate Woman which was going to be my moment to shine, but Kay Mellor has written me a scene in The Syndicate which goes out next year, so I'm going to swan in and do a day, which is probably all I can manage. I am so chuffed.' Reflecting on the past year, she said: 'What's been so wonderful this year is that I've learnt so much from people. You know when you get so cynical in life - they say yet again you're not right for this part. 'You learn so much and the biggest thing - as you know I'm not very confrontational, I'm a bit of a weed, of course I've become a bit grumpy - it's amazing to be able to say things to people. It's taken me 66 years to find any dignity.' Bellingham said she had never taken the view that her illness was 'not fair'. 'To be honest we have no right to live forever. You know how I love a survey - a survey says you can live until you're 80, yes lovely, but it's not a given. Somebody else decides when you pop off the twig,' she said. Nolan cried at the end of the interview, but Bellingham consoled her, saying: 'Don't cry. It's going to be fine, it will be fine - don't worry.' Lynda (pictured in 2001) said in the interview that she was 'obsessed' with Christmas was looking forward to having a 'real tree' this year .

"A massive search is underway for four young siblings who police believe were snatched by their allegedly abusive parents after they bonded out of jail. The sisters, one-year-old Mendy, two-year-old Evelin, five-year-old Jackelyn and six-year-old Kimberly, were last seen at their home in Canton, Mississippi on September 7. The girls had been put into state protective custody after their mother and stepfather were arrested on abuse and neglect charges but authorities believe the couple took them after being released. 'We have every reason to believe the children are in danger,' Canton Assistant Police chief Juan Cloy said. Fears: Four sisters, including one-year-old Mendy Coria-Coronado (left) and two-year-old Evelin Fernanda Coria-Coronado (right), are missing from their Mississippi home. Cops believe they were taken by their parents . Where are they? Jackelyn Belinda Gomez-Coronado, five (left) and Kimberly Elizabeth Gomez-Coronado, six (right), have also been missing from the home in Canton since September 12 . He said they were desperate to get the girls away from their stepfather, 24-year-old Fernando Coria-Pelay, who was charged with felony child abuse in May. The girls' mother, 28-year-old Sonia Elisabeth Coronado, had been charged with felony child neglect in the case and had agreed to testify against her partner. 'We want to get him away from the children,' Cloy said of the stepfather. Madison county District Attorney Michael Guest told Mississippi News Now that the prosecutor said the children had suffered the 'worst physical abuse marks she's ever seen'. 'These children were severely beaten at the hands of [Pelay] not to the point where they required hospitalization, but well and beyond the type of necessary discipline for a 5-6 year old,' Guest said. Wanted: The girls' stepfather Fernando Coria-Pelay, left, and their mother Sonia Elisabeth Coronado, right, are believed to have taken them after leaving jail earlier this month. Pelay had been ordered not to contact them . After the children vanished on September 7, the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation issued a missing and endangered child alert for them on September 12. Cloy said Canton police have issued kidnapping warrants for Coria-Pelay and Coronado, but he would not say whether investigators believe the family is still in Mississippi. Investigators added that authorities had granted temporary custody of the children to the mother, and a no contact order had been in place to keep Fernando Pelayo away. Their case was due to go to trial next month. The girls' full names are: Kimberly Elizabeth Gomez-Coronado (aged six), Jackelyn Belinda Gomez-Coronado (five), 2-year-old Evelin Fernanda Coria-Coronado (two) and Mendy Coria-Coronado (one). Last seen: The girls were last seen at their home in Canton, Mississippi on this road on September 7 . All were born in the United States, while their mother is from Guatemala and the stepfather is from Mexico. Authorities did not release the whereabouts of their biological father(s). Canton police are working with state and federal investigators and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children on the case, Cloy said. If you have information regarding the whereabouts of the girls or their parents, contact Investigator Eilarene Walker with the Canton Police Department at 601-859-2121.","Sisters Mendy, one, Evelin, two, Jackelyn, five, and Kimberly, six, vanished from their Canton, Mississippi home on September 7 .

"A maintenance worker died after his clothes got caught in a bowling alley machine he was trying to repair, according to authorities. David Geiger, 53, was working on a pinsetter machine at Northwest Lanes on Happy Valley Drive, Ohio at 2 p.m. when his clothes got caught on something and the machine pulled him to his death. Dozens of customers were inside the bowling alley at the time but no one saw the accident take place. Death: David Geiger, pictured here in the back row, died after his clothes became caught in a pinsetter machine . Bowling: He was working on a pinsetter machine at Northwest Lanes on Happy Valley Drive, Ohio . Machine: Dozens of customers were inside the bowling alley at the time but no one saw the accident . It wasn’t until other employees paged the victim several times and didn’t get a response from him that they went looking for him and found him. According to Fairfield police, Geiger had been sent to repair a machine that was having a problem. After he'd been back there for quite some time, staff tried to call him, and when he didn't answer the call they went back there and found him. Co-workers said that Geiger had worked at the bowling alley for four years and lived in Southwest Ohio but not in Fairfield. Former co-worker, Nathan Hursell, told WCPO-TV that Geiger had been working in the bowling alley business for 30 years, including several years when they worked together. He said Geiger was very familiar with the machines and knew exactly what he was doing, so his death was a 'freak accident.' Hursell, now the head mechanic at another bowling alley - Madison Bowl in Oakley - told WCPO-TV: 'The machines he maintained are are about 40-50 years old.

'They're good machines but just like any running machine they're dangerous -- they got gears, pulleys, everything's running back there.' He added: 'He was real sociable, a real nice guy. He was married with a couple of kids.' 'I couldn't believe it I was shocked, you know, tragic moment for anybody, let alone him. Dave was a stand up guy. Butler County coroner will carry out an autopsy  on Friday   to determine an exact cause of death. Police said it wasn’t clear if he had been strangled or crushed by the machinery. But preliminary investigations suggest his shirt became caught on the machine. The owners of Northwest Lanes have declined to comment other than to say they were 'very sad and upset.' They also shut the business down on Thursday night. An investigator from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration was sent. But agency officials said they haven't had any previous investigations at the bowling alley, which has been operational since 1976. Meanwhile, Hursell said he is more concerned with safety than ever. He said: 'Any call I run on a machine now [what happened to Dave] goes through my head.' 'He knew exactly what he was doing back there. It's one of those things where you don't think twice of that happening. It's just a common spot that we get in the machines at and it's just a freak accident.'

"Madonna Badger lost her three young daughters nearly three years ago in a tragic Christmas Day house fire, but she says she's been able to overcome her grief thanks to the spiritual support of her children who have appeared to her in moments of despair. In a recent interview with Oprah, the 50-year-old advertising executive reflects on Christmas morning 2011, the day she lost her 9-year-old Lily, 7-year-old twins Sarah and Grace and parents Pauline and Lomer Johnson when her Stamford, Connecticut home caught fire. Ms Badger and her then-boyfriend Michael Borcino were the only survivors. Her ex-husband Matthew Badger blames Borcino for the blaze and death of his children, which officials said started when Mr Borcino left a bucket of still-smoldering fireplace embers in the home's mud room. Scroll down for video . Still grieving: Madonna Badger, 50, lost her three young daughters and parents in a tragic Christmas morning house fire in 2011 . Beautiful girls: She says her children once appeared to her when she started hysterically crying in the bathroom. Pictured above her 7-year-old twins Sarah and Grace, left, and 9-year-old daughter Lily (right) Heart to heart: Ms Badger talked about the spiritual experience during an interview with Oprah, nearly three years after the house fire . Despite the incredible loss, Ms Badger has managed to return to work and even find love in long-time friend William Duke, with whom she tied the knot this summer. In her emotional talk on Oprah's Super Soul Sundays,  Ms Badger describes how her children once reached out to her when she hit the rock-bottom of grief. Ms Badger says she starting intensely crying in the bathroom one day, when she looked in the mirror and thought: 'Wow that woman is in a lot of pain'. She says her daughter Sarah then appeared in the reflection along with the other victims of the fire. 'Then Sarah came to me and  Lily and Grace and everybody was there,' Ms Badger told Oprah, 'And Sarah talked to me and she told me not to be afraid - that there was nothing to be afraid of and that love was the most important thing in the world. And that dreams are more real than this life.' Ms Badger immediately called her friend, to tell her of the 'mind-blowing' experience. 'I said: ""This is real, It is real, it is real. You know I'm not making this up. They're really talking to me.' Wrecked: Officials in Stamford, Connecticut ruled that the fire started because of a bucket of still-smoldering embers placed in the home's mud room. But Ms Badger believes an electrical issue was the real source of the fire . Five members of one family: Parents Pauline and Lomer Johnson (pictured above with her children) also died in the house fire. Mr Johnson was a Santa at Saks Fifth Avenue in New York City . While Ms Badger does not claim to see visions of her children often, she does admit to feeling their presence when she's feeling good. 'When I get bitter and really angry, I don't feel my children,' she said. Ms Badger also describes her happy final night her her family, when her mother Pauline backed her famous apple pie and sugar cookies. And her father returned home from his seasonal job working as Santa at Saks Fifth Avenue. The next morning she woke up to thick smoke in the house and despite her desperate attempts, was not able to save any of her children. In the aftermath of the blaze, it was revealed that her boyfriend Mr Borcino was leading two of the girls out of the house when both bolted back into the flames to their deaths. After an investigation, Connecticut officials ruled the house had caught fire after Mr Borcino swept up embers in one of the home's fireplaces and places the still-smoldering embers in the mud room. A father's loss: Ms Badger had her children with ex-husband Matthew Badger (pictured on a family outing above) Ex: At the time, she was dating Michael Borcino. They were the only two survivors of the fire. The former couple pictured above at the funeral . However, Ms Badger tells Oprah that she doesn't believe that's what started the fire - since she saw a nearby electrical box spew sparks in the middle of the fire. 'Something really major happened,' Ms Badger said. 'I don't know what happened but I think someone does. I think there's got to be someone out there who knows what happened...and my prayer is that they are going to come forth and tell the truth.' She has since filed a lawsuit against the city and two officials who ordered her house knocked down the day after the fire. She says that action prevented them from conducting a thorough investigation. Ms Badger has had a unimaginably difficult past three years, but there has been some happiness as well. Last year she returned to work at the advertising company she helped found,  Badgers & Winters. 'It does help a lot,' Ms Badgers said. 'It gives me purpose and makes me feel good about what I'm doing.' She also found rekindled her friends with real-estate broker William Duke, and the two eloped this summer in Brooklyn. The couple have known each other since Ms Badger was 19 and she call Mr Duke her 'rock'. While she admits feeling suicidal in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy, she says she is now determined to live the best life possible in order to make her daughter's proud. She found love!

"School chiefs have been blasted by parents after banning pupils from going to the toilet during lessons - even locking the doors during class times. Parents of pupils at Westlands School and Sittingbourne Community College  in Sittingbourne, Kent, were outraged after being told their children could only go to the loo during lessons if they had a note from their doctor.

The 42-year-old said: 'My son came home and told me that all the school toilets were locked when they were in their lessons. 'He said that one pupil asked to go, saying they were desperate and they were told they could only go during break time. 'The simple fact is that children are embarrassed to ask in front of their friends, so the school will end up dealing with a lot of wee on the floor if they don't change the policy.' Clare Stevens said her stepson Kieran was a pupil at the Westlands School and that he had been refused to be excused from class to go to the toilet. She said her son was told he must go and see the nurse first, who would then decide on whether he could use the loo. 'What happens if a child has a funny tummy and needs to go right there and then?' asked one parent . Speaking this week, she told the Sittingbourne News: 'The nurse's office is a 10 minute walk to the other side of the building, and all the toilets are locked on the way there. 'When he got there the nurse questioned him about why he had to go.' Mother Sam Bright, whose daughter is in Year 8, said: 'She was absolutely bursting the other week and she was told that she couldn't go and to sit back down unless she had a medical note.' Another, who asked not to be named, said: 'How can they treat children like this? 'What happens if a child has a funny tummy and needs to go right there and then? Why are they locking the loo doors - the whole thing is preposterous.' Simon Cox, the head of Westlands School, said the only toilets open to children during lessons were at the nurse's office. He added: 'During lessons, when teachers are in classrooms, safeguarding protocols would suggest that it is not common sense to allow pupils to have access to toilet areas which are not supervised. 'We encourage pupils to use our extensive toilet facilities at break time and lunchtime, but the school provides an alternative facility during lessons, which is supervised by our support team.' SCC head teacher Fiona Trigwell said: 'The policy of the school is children don't go to the toilet during lesson hours.' A spokeswoman for children's charity ERIC (Education and Resources for Improving Childhood Continence), which campaigns on the slogan 'Every Child Has The Right To Go', said the policy was 'totally wrong'. Rhia Weston, of ERIC, said: 'It is extremely important that children are allowed to go to the toilet when they need to, otherwise they can develop problems with their health and wellbeing. 'Preventing them from going by locking toilets or having a school policy of no toilet breaks is the completely wrong approach. 'What schools often don't realise is that this kind of policy can affect children's school performance as well because of the impact that holding on or not drinking enough water can have on concentration and energy levels. 'Children who do not drink enough water at school because they want to avoid using the toilet can also suffer from headaches. 'This is an issue that affects all pupils, not just those with continence problems, so schools need to take it seriously.'","Parents are outraged at the Kent school's policy .

"It's an anniversary that won't be celebrated, but this week marks the 20th birthday of air tax. And shockingly in that time, Air Passenger Duty (APD) has risen by 870 per cent, nine times faster than duties on wine, beer and petrol. Relentless rises in Air Passenger Duty mean that a family of four flying to a destination outside Europe will soon pay £284 in tax, compared with just £40 when the levy was introduced on November 1, 1994. Relentless rises: Air tax has risen astronomically over the 20 years since its inception . Infographic shows the rises in everyday taxes between 1994 and 2014, illustrating the extreme air tax rise . Willie Walsh, chief executive of British Airways' parent company IAG, said: 'Twenty years on, APD has snowballed out of control and become a tax that works against people wanting to visit relatives and friends, go on holiday or grow their business to create jobs. 'APD is way out of line with both other indirect taxes in the UK and flight taxes in other countries. Globalisation has accelerated enormously in the last 20 years. This tax helps no-one in today's economic environment. We must call time on APD.' Back in 1994 short-haul passengers paid £5 per person, and long-haul passengers £10. Now a 160 per cent increase has taken it up to £13 for short haul flights, while a long haul flight will come in at between £67-£93 in tax. That seven-fold increase in APD has taken place while inflation has not even doubled over the same period. APD, which is the highest aviation tax imposed anywhere in the world, has also hugely outstripped other UK taxes such as petrol duty, road tax, duties on alcohol and insurance premiums over the last two decades. A family of four flying to a destination outside Europe will soon pay £284 in tax, compared with just £40 in 1994 . Ryanair believe the abolition of APD would create more flights and some 60,000 new jobs . A spokesperson for Ryanair told Mail Online Travel: 'APD is damaging for traffic, tourism and jobs, makes countries uncompetitive and hinders countries from reaching their full tourism potential. 'Many European countries, including Belgium, Ireland and the Netherlands, have scrapped APD after traffic declined at their airports and have since returned to growth. Indeed, in the six months since the Irish Government scrapped APD on April 1, over 1.1m additional customers have travelled through the five main Irish airports, with Ryanair contributing 60 per cent of this growth. 'The UK Government should follow suit, as the abolition of APD would yield 0.46 per cent of the UK GDP in the first year and at least £16bn within three years, creating new flights and 60,000 new jobs.' Low-cost carriers such as easJet believe the abolition of Air Passenger Duty would boost the UK economy . These sentiments are echoed by easyJet, who added: 'easyJet has long campaigned for the abolition of Air Passenger Duty because independent research shows that it would boost the UK economy and pay for itself by increasing revenues from other sources. 'The UK has the highest air passenger taxes in the world. This has a negative impact on tourism, investment and business activity.' Annual Treasury revenue from APD is now nearly ten times as much as in the tax's first full year. In total, air passengers in the UK have paid more than £26 billion in APD since 1994. Even on short-haul flights, APD has become a big proportion of the ticket price. The £26 APD payable per person on a return flight within the UK is frequently at least a quarter of the total fare. According to City analysts PwC, abolition of APD would boost Britain's economic growth by 0.5 per cent within a year and lead to the creation of 60,000 new jobs without reducing the Treasury's net revenues. Back in August, a Treasury spokesman said: 'The government has taken steps to reform Air Passenger Duty and at Budget 2014 announced changes which, from April 1, 2015, will abolish the two highest tax bands. 'The reforms will cut tax for millions of passengers travelling to emerging markets such as China, Brazil and India, and to places with historic ties to the UK such as south Asia and the Caribbean. 'In 2015-16, over 99 per cent of passengers will see a freeze or cut in APD.'","Family of four flying outside Europe pay up to £284 now, was £40 in 1994 .

"An eco-friendly chip shop boss has used his loaf to come up with a novel way of cutting down on litter - by serving all of his meals in bread.

And it was after punters kept asking for a bread bun with their chips that his  idea became a reality and he decided to make the packaging edible. For £1 extra customers can eat the container their food is served in - a full half loaf of white bread - at Mister Eaters Eating Emporium in Preston, Lancs.

The chip shop boss (pictured) said both he and his customers are now happy as they get more food for their money and leave no mess afterwards with his novel serving suggestion . Now John and his customers are both happy as they get more food for their money and leave no mess afterwards. The idea is said to be going down a treat at the popular chip shop with fish and chips, sausage and chips, and pie, chips and gravy all being gobbled from the loaves. Mr Clarkson said he initially had the idea after a trip to Durban, South Africa, where he sampled bunny chow - a popular fast food consisting of a hollowed-out loaf of bread filled with curry. So when he was looking for a recyclable alternative to the usual plastic trays and chips in newspaper, he had the perfect idea. Using your loaf: Mister Eaters chip shop in Preston, Lancashire, has come up with a novel way of cutting down on litter, by serving all of his meals in bread for an £1 extra. Mr Clarkson wanted to come up with 100% recyclable, litter-free packaging after becoming tired of seeing paper trays flying around outside his shop . He said: 'People normally buy their meal and a barm which is an extra 55p, so for an extra £1 they're getting half a loaf. 'It's been quite funny to see people walking around in the street with a loaf of bread filled with chips, instead of a tray, but it's certainly meant less mess. It's that big a lot of people have been saying it's a 'bready meal for two'.' 'What's more, the cook says that if the meal proves too much for customers but they still miss the bin - it means peckish pigeons can grab a feast. It's eco-friendly and it's a bit of a novelty, so it's going down a storm.'

"A New York-based real estate agent has denied he is a Rod Stewart impersonator who has been roaming the city in recent months pretending to be the rock star to get free drinks and meals from his fans. Paul Anton, 62, who lives in Midtown West, admits that he does look like the Maggie May singer, but does not use the resemblance to con unwitting fans. He was photographed on the Subway recently looking a little the worse for wear, and internet users speculated as to whether he was the doppelganger who has been scamming fans in the city. Paul Anton, pictured on a Downtown Train, has denied he is the 'fake Rod Stewart' plaguing New York City . The multi-millionaire singer, left, is due to play Las Vegas this week, while Mr Anton, right, is in real estate . The sneaky lookalike - who was a British accent - has attended soccer World Cup parties over the summer pretending to be the veteran singer, and has been dubbed 'Rockaway Rod' for his random New York City cameos . But Mr Anton insisted he had never used his likeness to Stewart to get free drinks. He told the Page6.com: 'I have never pretended to be Rod Stewart. I am a respected businessman with children, I have never asked for free drinks. I pay my own way. 'People do mistake me for Rod, but I always say I’m not him. I would like to shake Rod’s hand and say I am not an imposter. I love his music, but I wouldn’t pretend to be him. And I’ve never been to the Rockaways.' Paul Anton, pictured, looks and dresses similar to Rod Stewart, but always says he is not the singer . Rod Stewart pictured alongside Rolling Stone Ronnie Wood, while Paul Anton is photographed with a fan . Mr Anton was recently photographed by a star-struck fan on the Subway who mistook him for the singer. 'This is the way I look,' he said. This follows several reports about a bogus Rod Stewart operating in the Meatpacking district of Manhattan looking for free food and drinks. Stewart's manager Arnold Stiefel said: 'The real Rod has seen the [subway] picture, and he thought it was funny, but he said, ""Please let people know it isn’t me"".' According to  Stiefel, there has been a problem with impersonators for the past 15 years. On one occasion a deputy sheriff from outside New Orleans rang claiming to have the star locked up in a drunk tank for being drunk and disorderly. 'I said, ""You'd better call the Dorchester in London because he's there right now."" The real Rod... thought it was funny, but said let people know it wasn't me"".' The real singer, however, is in Las Vegas, Nevada, where he is performing in Caeser's Palace before heading to Australia and New Zealand in the New Year.","British doppelganger Paul Anton is often mistaken for signer Rod Stewart .

"The Italian divorce fraud fooled judges at 137 county courts in England and Wales for 18 months before it was spotted . British judges were conned into rubber-stamping 180 fake divorces masterminded by Italian fraudsters on an ‘industrial-scale’. The scam is likely to have netted more than £500,000 for the organisers, who offered quick, cheap divorces to unhappy Italians. Couples have to wait a minimum of three years to divorce in Italy but that can be reduced to months if they lie about their circumstances in an English court. The Italian divorce fraud fooled judges at 137 county courts in England and Wales for 18 months before a sharp-eyed office worker spotted a flaw in papers presented to a court in Burnley. She questioned why two Italians who had the same address in Berkshire were applying for their divorces more than 200 miles away in Lancashire. Investigations revealed that 179 Italians who divorced in British courts had all claimed to be living at an address that turned out to be a mailbox in Maidenhead, Berkshire. The last divorce was given to a spouse whose address was a mailbox in Epsom, Surrey. Couples were charged £3,000 to £4,000. The divorces were finalised between August 2010 and February 2012. But all were quashed yesterday by the leading family law judge, Sir James Munby, President of the Family Division, who said it was ‘a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice on an almost industrial scale’. In the scam, husbands and wives signed English legal forms that were filled in by the plotters with false details. The forms claimed they lived at the bogus addresses, and that they had been separated by mutual agreement for more than two years in accordance with English law. However, in many cases the Italians had actually been separated for much shorter periods. The divorces were valid in Italy. Last night family lawyers said the fraud was made possible by the ease of divorce under English law, and questioned whether similar cons were being organised for couples from other countries. The conspiracy worked because the divorce papers were spread around many courts, none of which cross-checked the addresses. Anyone in England and Wales can apply to divorce at a county court anywhere in the country. The leading family law judge, Sir James Munby, President of the Family Division, pictured, said the scam was ‘a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice on an almost industrial scale’ Sir James said there was no reason to believe the Italians had ever lived in Britain, and the Maidenhead address ‘was in fact mailbox 201, one of a number of small boxes located in commercial premises’. He added: ‘Given the dimensions of the mailbox it is clear that not even a single individual, however small, could possibly reside in it. The moving spirit of the operation was someone calling herself Dr Frederica Russo. I have no idea whether that is her real name.’ The couples paid someone called Anita Colucci, who may actually be Dr Russo, he said. The boxes were rented by Francesco Galata, of Sarzana, north-west Italy. Police said he charged £120 an hour to ‘facilitate divorces across Europe’. Catherine Jones, of JMW Solicitors, said: ‘The manner of divorce in England and Wales is quicker and cheaper than almost anywhere else in the world with, perhaps, the exception of the Dominican Republic or Las Vegas. In Italy, it can take more than three years and, it would appear, that might be too long for a considerable number of people.’","Fraud fooled judges at 137 courts in England and Wales for 18 months .

"America's 'most hated' airline has cheerfully released a report revealing what passengers despise most about their service, following a request for them to unleash their fury via social media. In July, Spirit Airlines announced that it would give 8,000 air miles to any traveller who vented their anger about poor flying experiences on its or other airlines. It has been inundated with more than 28,000 complaints, according the report, which they have named the 'State of the Hate'. Worst offender: Spirit has received the most complaints of any airlines for the past five years . 'Airline hate is at an all-time high,' the airline says on its website. 'Airlines mess up - we're willing to admit it, and we're working to get better.' It's not just Spirit Airlines passengers are moaning about. Following the announcement of the 'Hate Miles' campaign over the summer, 60 per cent of the grievances on social media have been directed at other airlines. The airline's President and CEO Ben Baldanza expressed his surprise over the findings in a statement. 'I think if any organisation asks for feedback you would expect the vast majority of responses would be directed at the company that seeks it, but in this case we were surprised that most consumers chose to share their frustrations about other airlines,' he said. Seating - 20% . Lost bags - 16% . Delays - 15% . Service - 15% . Fees - 12% . Cost - 7% . Legroom - 7% . Food and drink - 5% . Boarding - 2% . Cancelled flights - 1% . Spirit - 40% . Delta - 12% . United - 10% . American - 8% . Southwest - 7% . US Airways - 5% . Jetblue - 3% . Frontier - 2% . Airtran - 2% . Other - 10% . Spirit was still far the worst offender, accounting for 40 per cent of online backlash, followed by Delta (12 per cent) and United Airlines (10 per cent). Uncomfortable seating was the motivation behind 20 per cent of the online criticisms. Lost bags was another common grievance (16 per cent), followed by delays and service (both 15 per cent). Spirit was surprised to learn that they were only the worst offenders for one of these grievances: Extra fees. Its answer? 'Some people call the, fees. We think of them as options. Other airlines bundle them into your fare. But when you fly with us, you pay only for what you use.' The budget airline hopes customers can learn to love their 'no frills' approach. 'We need to continue educating our customers about our business model,' said Baldanza. 'Our experience shows once customers understand how much money they save with our model, they like it a lot.' Spirit Airlines made headlines earlier in the year when the 'Hate Miles' campaign was launched, in response to receiving more complaints than any other airlines five years in a row. In return for venting their anger about a bad experience on board Spirit or one of their competitors, passengers were rewarded with 8,000 free air miles. As ever, there’s a catch – with passengers needing 10,000 total miles to secure a free flight, or flyers can sign up for the airline’s credit card to be able to book 2,500-mile one-way fares. In April, MailOnline Travel reported every year from 2009-2013, passengers were three times as likely to have an issue with Spirit than they were the second-place airline. The figures were calculated based on complaints - from flights and fares, to baggage and refunds – per 100,000 passengers. In fact, Spirit received so many complaints, according to the the US Public Interest Research Group Education Fund report, it had to be excluded from deeper analysis of on-time performance, baggage mishandling, and other issues. The airline also has its own ‘boycott Spirit’ Facebook page, and a Twitter handle called @hatespiritair. The report, which analysed consumer complaints filed with the Department of Transportation, said of Spirit: 'Two checked bags, basic meals and snacks, carry-ons, and, often, in-flight entertainment were formerly included in the price of your ticket, but now add-on fees for each of these newly a la carte items can easily add $100 or more to the cost of a one-way ticket.’","Unpopular Spirit Airlines asked passengers to air grievances on social media .

"Immigrant drug baron: Mahmoud Jaber, 31, had been peddling heroin and crack cocaine in Lancashire . An immigrant drug baron will finally be thrown out of Britain after he exploited human rights laws to legally stay in the country and commit more crimes for eight years. Mahmoud Jaber, 31, had been peddling heroin and crack cocaine in Lancashire to live a lavish lifestyle and served three jail terms. But although he was told he would be deported as long ago as 2006, Palestinian-born Jaber - whose father lives in the UK - used Article Eight of the Human Rights Act to successfully appeal the order, arguing he had a ‘right to family life.’ Yet he was then convicted of a string of further drug trafficking offences - claiming he was ‘emotionally scarred into drug taking’ by his experiences after being born in a refugee camp in the Palestinian West Bank. When he was again warned he would be deported back to Palestine, Jaber again used Article Eight in a bid to stay in the UK. Today it was revealed that after a series of legal battles and appeals, an immigration judge has ordered Jaber to be sent back to Palestine - saying the criminal had an ‘appalling history.’ It is thought the case will have cost the taxpayer thousands of pounds in legal fees. The saga began after Jaber arrived in Britain in 1988 for a six-month stay only to come back permanently in February 1992, to join his father and move to Accrington, Lancashire. New home: The saga began after Jaber arrived in Britain in 1988 for a six-month stay only to come back permanently in February 1992, to join his father and move to Accrington (pictured) in Lancashire . His father - who had arrived earlier in the UK in 1987 had already lost a battle to claim asylum in 1990 but he was granted leave to remain due to ‘exceptional circumstances.’ Jaber was allowed indefinite leave himself in 1998 in line with his father and attempted to get British citizenship. But in 2003 he was convicted of a series of offences including resisting police and possessing Class A drugs. The following year he was back in . court for drugs offences and in September of that year he was jailed for . four years for dealing crack cocaine and heroin. In . April 2006, Jaber was told he would be deported but in May the . following year he lodged an appeal under Article Eight and won the right . to stay. In December 2008, . he was repeatedly brought into court where he was convicted of . possessing cannabis, cocaine and breaching court orders. Then . at Burnley Crown Court in October 2010, Jaber was convicted of intent . to supply heroin and crack cocaine and manufacturing crack was jailed . for six years. The court heard Jaber had turned an empty flat into a drugs factory and police recovered heroin and crack cocaine worth almost £25,000. Detectives said his commercial dealing on ‘a significant scale’ and was said to be close to the importation of drugs. Jaber kept £4,000 in cash at his home and officers found a receipt for a £6,000 Breitling watch. He was also was driving around in a £60,000 BMW M3. At the time, Jaber claimed he had spent the first eight years of his life in a refugee camp on the Palestinian West Bank. He said his experiences in the camp were ‘horrific’ and he was so ‘scarred’ by what he saw he experimented with cannabis when he was 13 - five years after he arrived in the UK. Jaber claimed his drug use increased to cocaine due to ‘family issues’ and intially claimed all the drugs found at the flat were for his own use. In 2011, Jaber was warned he faced deportation yet in 2012 but he again claimed it would result in a ‘breach of his human rights.’ Whilst his appeal was in the pipeline, in 2013 he was convicted of money laundering and jailed for an extra 21 months after Preston Crown Court was told he used drugs money to buy an Audi Quattro S5 for £44,000. Later that year he was ordered to pay back £37,147.06 as proceeds of crime. The appeal came to a tribunal in Bradford, West Yorks, on October last year an immigration panel ordered he be deported saying removal would ‘not be disproportionate.’ The panel concluded his offending was ‘simply too serious to outweigh his claims to remain in the United Kingdom because of his history.’ The panel said his length of time in the UK was ‘outweighed by the public interest in keeping society safe from a perennial offender who they believed in all likelihood would be a serious threat to individuals.’ But Jaber appealed to the Upper . Immigration Tribunal in Manchester and used Human Rights laws to argue . he would be at ‘risk of harm’ if he was returned to Palestine. His lawyer Carla Rawlinson claimed . Jaber's safety could be in jeopardy because his uncle had been killed by . Israeli forces during militia insurgency in 1989. Abroad: Jaber claimed he was 'emotionally scarred into drug taking' by his experiences after being born in a refugee camp in the Palestinian West Bank. A file image of the Palestinian refugee camp of Kalandia is seen . She said Jaber would have to pass through an Israeli checkpoint and the checkpoints into Palestine are controlled by the Israeli occupying forces. She claimed at best, he would be turned away by the Israelis and at worst he would be at risk of harm because of his ‘history’ and the history of his uncle. 'I am satisfied, given this appellant's appalling history, that the appeal fails' Judge Richard Chalkley . She said the length of time Jaber had been away from Palestine in itself, would cause him to be at risk of enquiry by the Israeli authorities, who would want to know why he had been out of Palestine for 20 years. But rejecting the appeal on April 3, Judge Richard Chalkley said: ‘I am satisfied, given this appellant's appalling history, that the appeal fails. The appellant has not raised an asylum claim. ‘He had not raised an Article 3 claim and given that he was represented throughout, if there was a serious possibility that on his return he would be at risk, then I have no doubt whatsoever that it would have been raised as an asylum claim or an Article 3 claim. ‘I find that there are no errs of law in this determination, which I uphold.’ Last year, 200 offenders – including rapists and muggers – successfully . challenged their removal by citing Article 8 of Labour’s Human Rights . Act. A Somali rapist, who held a knife to a pregnant woman’s throat as he assaulted her, is among the many criminals who cannot be deported from Britain because of rules on a right to family life. Mustafa Abdullahi (right), 31, was jailed for ten years in 2007 after he threatened to kill his ‘vulnerable’ victim and repeatedly raped her in her own home. He was set to be deported on release and Home Office lawyers warned immigration judges of his dangerous nature and a continued lack of respect for the law. But last December he was deemed to have a right to a family life under Article 8 and released. Abdullahi does not have any children or a wife in Britain, but his mother and siblings live here. Separately, last August it was revealed Sanel Sahbaz, a foreign criminal jailed for various violent attacks, had successfully argued against deportation because it would violate his human rights. Sahbaz, 30, a Bosnian who now lives in Hertford, came to Britain as a child in 1993. Since 2005 he has committed a string of offences including common assault, handling stolen goods, theft, public order offences and assaulting police. He qualified for automatic deportation after he was jailed for four years, and the Home Office told him he would be sent home. But he was told he can stay indefinitely after he brought a legal challenge under Article 8. His lawyers argued that if he was sent back to Bosnia it would separate him from his parents, brother and cousin, who are also in Britain, which would breach his rights. Learco Chindamo was jailed indefinitely for knifing to death headmaster Philip Lawrence, a father of four, 18 years ago outside St George's Roman Catholic School in Maida Vale, west London, in 1995. The teacher went to help a 13-year-old pupil who was being assaulted. The former gang member was ordered to serve at least 12 years, but released in July 2010 after claiming he was a reformed character. The Government was prevented from deporting Chindamo to Italy, where he lived as a child, after his lawyers argued it would breach his human right to a family life. He was freed and allowed to live in Britain, but returned to jail only months later for breaching the terms of his parole. He has remained in prison since but last week the Parole Board approved his release once again.","Mahmoud Jaber was peddling heroin and crack cocaine in Lancashire .

"They may be one of the world’s best loved and most photographed supercars, but one man has captured Ferraris in a whole new way. British artist Nick Veasey used a giant X-ray machine to show what’s inside a Ferrari, from its powerful engine to elegant interior. He captured 10 of Ferrari’s most iconic models produced in the last 50 years, including a Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona built in 1969. British artist Nick Veasey used a giant X-ray machine to show what’s inside a Ferrari, from its powerful engine to elegant interio. This x-ray image shows a Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona built in 1969 . To create his photograph, Mr Veasey X-rayed the cars using an extra-large machine at the Frauenhofer Institute in Fuerth, Germany. The artist suspended the Daytona in the machine for three days, exposing it to a dose of radiation that would prove fatal to humans, Die Welt reported. It is possible to create 3D images and zoom in on details using the high-tech X-ray machine. It measures 1,312 square ft (400 square metres) and 45ft (14 metres) tall, according to Focus. To create his photograph, Mr Veasey X-rayed the cars using an extra-large machine at the Frauenhofer Institute in Fuerth, Germany. Here, he holds a print of the finished image in front of the car . The artist suspended the Daytona in the X-ray machine for three days (pictured), exposing it to a dose of radiation that would prove fatal to humans.  It measures 1,312 square ft (400 square metres) and 45ft (14 metres) tall and can take 3D and zoomed-in images . The Ferrari 365 GTB/4 is better known as the Ferrari Daytona. It is one of the Italian car company's most iconic designs. The grand tourer-style car produced between 1968 and 1973. It is a traditional front-engined, rear-drive car with a 4.4 litre engine. Brand new models have a top speed of 174mph (280kph) and can go from 0-60mph in 5.4 seconds. The car was designed by Pininfarina, like many of Ferrari's most famous designs, but at the time, people said it looked more like Lamborghini. Early models had fixed headlights behind an acrylic cover. After 1971 retractable pop-up headlights were introduced. The Daytona has been voted the top sports car of the 1970s. Inside the massive machine there are two 26ft (eight metre) high towers for the X-ray source and the detector. Mr Veasey’s intention in creating the works are to show how things work and strip back objects from cars to clothes beyond their label. He has previously X-rayed bikes, machinery, clothing, animals and unusual household objects to show them in a surprising way. While none of the little details of the classic Ferrari, such as its prancing horse badge are captured in the image, it is immediately obvious to car fanatics that it is one of the famous Italian supercars. Mr Veasey is interested in the superficiality of objects as well as what’s inside them. ‘We live in a world obsessed with image. What we look like what our clothes are like, houses cars...I like to counter this obsession with superficial appearance by using X-rays to strip back the layers and show what it is like under the surface,’ he writes on his website. ‘Often the integral beauty adds intrigue to the familiar. We all make assumptions based on the external visual aspects of what surrounds us and we are attracted to people and forms that are aesthetically pleasing. I like to challenge this automatic way that we react to just physical appearance by highlighting the often surprising inner beauty.’ Mr Veasey’s intention in creating the works are to show how things work and strip back objects from cars to clothes beyond their label.

"A  woman who stopped eating after being bullied over the size of her breasts is to be the face of a new campaign against mental health stigma. So traumatised by repeated bullying about her large bust, Leanne McKillop, now 31, began to diet, which quickly spiraled into anorexia, resulting in her being admitted to hospital three times as the disease took over her life and left her dangerously ill. Now Leanne, from Greenock, in Scotland, has chosen to co-front a push by campaign group 'See Me', a Scotland-wide bid to end mental health stigma and discrimination, managed by the Mental Health Foundation and the Scottish Association for Mental Health (SAMH). Scroll down for video . Leanne was once so unwell with anorexia, she had to be -hospitalised three times and became dangerously ill . Leanne is speaking about her story to help others and encouraging people to join the See Me campaign . Leanne said the stigma she faced when she had the eating disorder led to her 'questioning herself as a person'. She said that people would tell her that all she had to do was 'pick up a fork' and by not eating she was 'hurting' her family. When boys at school began to tease Leanne about her big breasts, she stopped eating in a bid to shrink her 34E chest, but soon found herself unable to stop dieting and in the grip of anorexia. At her lowest ebb, Leanne weighed just 4st 7lb and told by doctors to eat or risk dying. After seeing anorexia claim the lives of two friends, Leanne turned the corner with the help of rehab clinic The Priory. Her experiences prompted her to take part in the new campaign will be launched in Glasgow's Royal Concert Hall on October 28. Leanne is speaking about her story to help others and is encouraging people to join the See Me campaign. She said: 'It only takes one person to change someone else's actions and that can have a knock-on affect.' Miss McKillop (pictured at 17) was teased at school about the size of her breasts and  became depressed . At her lowest ebb, Leanne weighed just 4st 7lb and told by doctors to eat or risk dying . See Me says nine out of ten people with mental health problems still suffer from stigma or discrimination in work, education, health care and at home. See Me programme director Judith Robertson, said: 'We are launching a campaign which signals the end of a culture in Scotland that actively discriminates against people with mental health problems, stigmatising them and their families. 'Everyone has mental health and we can all be hit by mental ill-health. But we each have the power to make a positive difference in the lives of our families, friends and colleagues when they are affected by mental health problems. Leanne said the stigma she faced when she had the eating disorder led to her 'questioning herself as a person' 'See Me, our partners, allies and supporters are building a movement which will bring people together from all over the country and encourage them to challenge discrimination at its roots. 'Our goal is equality that ensures people with mental health problems have the same opportunities as others to lead a fulfilled life.' The campaign also fronted by businessman Richard Monaghan who was in charge of 2000 employees across two companies when he had a breakdown . Co-fronting the campaign with Leanne is Richard Monaghan, who was a senior director in the rail industry, in charge of 2000 employees across two companies when he had a breakdown. Mr Monaghan, 61, from Moffat, Dumfriesshire, said the discrimination he faced had been 'horrendous'. He said: 'When I was a senior director I was constantly being contacted, as soon as it was revealed I had a break down from depression all communication with me stopped. 'People avoided having conversations with me, it was quite dreadful.' On one occasion a job centre worker told him there was ;no point' in continuing with an interview after he broke down in tears in front of 70 people. He said the stigma of his depression left him feeling 'worthless, alone and frightened'. See Me said that two out of three people with mental health problems actually stop some day to day activities because of the fear of stigma. The programme, to end mental health stigma and discrimination, want people to take action, which collectively will give a united and powerful voice to change negative behaviour. The action could range from directly challenging someone they see discriminating, to supporting someone who is struggling due to a mental health problem. With one in four people likely to experience a mental health problem every year, the new campaign is calling on the other three in four to be there to help. The true medical toll of the hundreds of young people who suffer from eating disorders has been revealed . The true medical toll of the hundreds of young people who suffer from eating disorders has been revealed in new figures released by the NHS - showing the problem could be four times as big as first thought. NHS hospitals have seen a sharp rise in the number of patients seen for conditions such as anorexia and bulimia in recent years. But new statistics show patients who suffer from an eating disorder are frequently treated at hospital for a life-threatening condition linked to their illness - rather than the eating disorder itself. For every patient seen in hospital for direct treatment of their eating disorder another three such patients are given appointments for ailments linked to their anorexia or bulimia. It means hospitals are treating hundreds of eating disorder patients for critical blood disorders, poisoning with prescription and over-the-counter medicines as well as severe stomach pains and vomiting. The full extent of the health problems associated with eating disorders comes after the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) revealed more details on the hospital records of eating disorder patients. In the document it shows that last year there were 3,127 occasions where people were treated in hospital where physicians logged the patient's main illness as an eating disorder. But there were also another 8,661 sessions in hospitals where doctors recorded a person suffering from such an illness being treated for a different but critical medical ailment. It means that every day of the year around 30 people get so sick because of their eating disorder that they need hospital treatment. Experts think even this figure is a vast underestimate of the number of people suffering from eating disorders as it is only when things tend to become desperate that these patients are treated in hospital. Other than being treated directly for their eating disorder the other most common ailments that these patients were treated for in the last year were: . 1. Chemical imbalance of the blood - 762 . 2. Accidental or deliberate poisoning by painkillers - 657 . 3. Mental and behavioural disorders due to alcohol - 304 . 4. Pain in the stomach and pelvic area - 304 . 5. Accidental or deliberate poisoning by psychiatric medicines - 252 . 6. Personality disorders - 176 . 7. Insulin-dependent diabetes - 167 . Patients who suffer from an eating disorder are frequently treated at hospital for a life-threatening condition linked to their illness . 8. Accidental or deliberate poisoning by tranquilizers - 162 . 9. Nausea and vomiting - 138 . 10. Other diseases of the digestive system - 127 . Separate NHS figures show that women aged 15 to 19 are the group most likely to receive hospital care for their eating disorders - with appointment for women outstripping men by ten to one. A spokesman for the eating disorder charity Beat, said: 'Eating disorders are psychological illnesses with physical consequences and certainly we know that where an individual has an eating disorder as well as diabetes that these two conditions must be treated together. Similarly a personality disorder should also be treated alongside the eating disorder. 'Those hospitalised with an eating disorder diagnosis are very much the tip of the iceberg - there are many hundreds of thousands of others who are awaiting treatment or not had the courage to seek it. 'Early diagnosis and quick access to treatment is crucial when treating an eating disorder which has the highest mortality rate of any psychological illness.'","Leanne developed anorexia after being bullied over her large bust .

He was born with a condition called strabismus which means his eyes are not correctly aligned and point in different directions. Scroll down for video . Rescue dog Dennis, a three-year-old Collie, was given to the Dogs Trust branch in Kenilworth, Warwickshire, a month ago after his owner was no longer able to care for him. He has since been unable to find new owners . He was born with a condition called strabismus which means his eyes are not correctly aligned and point in different directions. Despite the condition not affecting his eyesight, potential owners are said to put off . Despite his condition, he has relatively good eyesight but it has hampered him in finding a new home as potential owners are put off because of his eyes. Jane Hirons, support relations officer at the centre, said: 'We take in hundreds of dogs of all shapes and sizes but I have never seen anything quite like Dennis. 'Some people will overlook any dogs that have a slight health problem or appear different, and even with his striking good looks and fun personality Dennis is often passed by - possibly due to his unusual eyes. 'But he is such a cheeky character. He is an affectionate, fun loving boy who adores his carers and loves to be with other dogs. 'This energetic boy is looking for an active family, could live with children as young as six and must be rehomed with another dog. 'Dennis may not be winning any frisbee catching competitions any time soon but he is a super dog who will make a fantastic pet in the right home so we have everything crossed he will find it soon.'

Paula Boyden, Dogs Trust veterinary director, added: 'We rarely see a dog at our rehoming centres with this condition and Dennis is definitely the only cross-eyed Collie I have come across. 'Fortunately, Dennis is a happy dog and his new owner will not need to treat him differently from a fully sighted dog, though they do need to consider he may find it slightly harder to focus which can make it more difficult for him to catch a ball.'","Dennis has condition called strabismus which means his eyes aren't aligned .

"This should come as no surprise to anyone who has experienced pre-flight anxiety while travelling with their significant other. A study from the Airline Passenger Experience Foundation (APEX) analysed the things that passengers worry about the most while travelling and it revealed that men and women have conflicting priorities or fears before a flight. It turns out the biggest worry for most men is whether the flight will depart on time, while women are most concerned about getting to the airport on time. As for what they would like to see improve on a flight, 26 per cent of women say they want better lavatories, compared to 16 per cent of men. Overall, the number one request from passengers is better in-flight connectivity for wifi or mobile phone use, according to the APEX survey of nearly 1,650 people from eight countries (UK, US, Germany, China, Japan, Singapore, Australia and Brazil). And it appears Germans and Brits are the chattiest passengers as they spend 50 per cent more time conversing than travellers from other countries. Infographic reveals the findings of an Airline Passenger Experience Association Survey . Seven out of ten respondents said they are satisfied with the quality and selection of in-flight snacks or meals. The study also looked at how passengers spend their time on planes. Sixteen per cent of the time is spent sleeping, while 15 per cent is dedicated to watching in-flight films or television programmes. That was followed by reading for pleasure (12 per cent), watching films or programmes on a personal device (nine per cent) and eating (eight per cent).","The biggest worry for men is whether their flight will depart on time .

"Agony aunt Irma Kurtz said women who meet men online could be putting themselves in danger . Women who use dating websites risk attracting sexual predators – because they are unable to 'smell' their potential suitors, a leading agony aunt claimed yesterday. Irma Kurtz said women who meet men online could be putting themselves in danger because the use of technology robs them of their natural ability to sense a threat. The 78-year-old, who has been writing advice columns in Cosmopolitan for over 40 years, said she is inundated with letters from women claiming they have fallen in love with someone they met over the internet. Speaking at the Henley Literary Festival, supported by the Daily Mail, she said: 'The problem with social media – and I'm not a luddite, technology is really important – but the problem is that it leads so easily to wishful thinking, and wishful thinking is two inches away from lying and lying is right next door to lying to oneself. 'So I think the online world is making some more problems. Women are so eager to find what they're looking for, they want to find it and they think they've found it, but they haven't. 'Increasingly young women write to me to say they've fallen in love with someone who lives many miles away 'but I do love him, I am in love with him'. 'And my reply is you can't love someone you've never smelled. We mustn't lose intuition and what we know. It's dangerous in both senses. I worry about online connections.' While Miss Kurtz's views may sound a little unusual, they could have a scientific basis. According to a recent book, The Science of Love And Betrayal by Professor Robin Dunbar, a person's scent is one of the most revealing things about them because it is directly linked to their immune system. The book claims many women rate smell as more important than visual cues when it comes to sexual arousal and choice of lover. Women who use dating websites risk attracting sexual predators – because they are unable to 'smell' their potential suitors, according to the advice columnist . Miss Kurtz, who was publicising her latest book, My Life In Agony, said women should not forget to rely on their intuition, because it keeps them safe. She said: 'When I was a kid in Manhattan going to school, I'd be walking along with my friends, on the New York streets. 'And you'd see a guy coming towards you and without a word we'd just cross the street. It wasn't even 'hey I don't like the look of him' and then cross the street, it was just you crossed the street. 'I get a feeling now that people are so busy punching in messages in their portable machines that they're forgetting where they're going. 'Don't lose your ability to make judgments. And don't move too fast, especially when it comes to guys. Just eyes open, and slow down. And that does also mean watch the booze and the drugs.' It is not the first time Miss Kurtz has suggested women have the power to prevent themselves ending up in compromising situations. Earlier this year she faced a backlash after saying women should not get drunk around men because it puts them at risk of being raped. She said the onus was on the woman to protect herself from danger and suggested always taking a friend when meeting an online date for the first time. She said: 'I think you avoid meeting the guy, especially if it entails a journey, without somebody else – get a friend to come with you. 'And daylight only. I don't think you go and meet a strange man, even if you've met him online and you think you know him… you don't know him until you get a sniff of him.' Miss Kurtz, who has a son, worked as a journalist for 1960s magazine Nova, before joining Cosmopolitan as agony aunt in 1973. Her literary catalogue includes two novels, three travel books and three self- help manuals.","Irma Kurtz says women risk attracting sexual predators on dating websites .

"There really is no substitute for a mother's love, affection and protection. A baby black bear cries in distress for its mother in West Milford, New Jersey as it is being taunted by some hunters in this fascinating but disturbing footage. The young black bear is up a tree as the hunters watch the terrified animal and mock him in an undesirable and undignified manner. The male hunter, who records the footage, mockingly says, 'Do you want your mom? and he later adds, 'Come on down.'

"Two Apprentice contestants risked the ire of Lord Sugar after embarking on a romance during the competition. Businessman James Hill, 27, and solicitor Lauren Riley, 28, reportedly enjoyed a 'full-on fling' while competing for the £250,000 top prize. 'It didn't take [James] long to woo Lauren,' a source told The Sun's TVBiz. Scroll down for video . Romance: The Apprentice candidates James Hill and Lauren Riley had a fling during the competition . 'They had a fairly full-on fling. They were always sneaking off.' Lauren and James kept their place in the competition during the latest episode, after Robert Goodwin and Scott McCulloch given the boot by Lord Sugar. Last week, it was revealed that Hill, from Chesterfield, was given an 18-month suspended jail sentence after admitting two assault charges at Chesterfield Magistrates' Court. Wooed: A show insider said the pair had a 'full-on fling' during their time filming the series . Saved: Robert Goodwin and Scott McCulloch were given the boot by Lord Sugar in the latest episode . He beat up a bus driver who was talking to his girlfriend, hitting him with 'punch after punch' in an unprovoked attack that left the victim scarred for life. Months later, he was involved in another brawl in which he bit a man's ear. Hill apologised after his first victim, who asked not to be named, told how the candidate attacked him after he chatted to his girlfriend in a bar owned by the entrepreneur's father. Thug: Hill, 27, was given an 18-month suspended jail sentence after admitting two assault charges at Chesterfield Magistrates' Court . The victim, who said he knew the young woman as she worked at a local soft play centre, told the Sun: 'Hill stormed over and began throwing his fists - he threw punch after punch.' He said he fell to the floor and looked up, only to see a boot coming towards his face. Hill was dragged off by bouncers who told the victim he should call the police. He said: 'He was always starting fights and they wanted someone to teach him a lesson.' As Hill waited for his court case, he got into trouble again, this time biting a man's ear on Christmas Eve 2008. After the second attack, Hill was arrested and appeared at Chesterfield Magistrates' Court on March 2 2009, where he was charged under his full name of Anthony James Hill and admitted two counts of assault. In July that year he was sentenced to six months in prison, suspended, ordered to pay his victims £300 and £200 respectively, and told to pay £755 costs. Now Hill, who started out in business washing cars, uns several businesses including selling vending machines and running his own bar and restaurant. A spokesman for The Apprentice told MailOnline: 'It is a spent conviction under the provisions of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 and therefore James was eligible to apply for the programme.' A spokesman for Hill said: 'James is not proud of what happened. He was young and irresponsible and very much regrets - and has learned from - his actions.' You're fired! No doubt Lord Sugar won't be happy to find out the candidates are getting frisky on his time . This is not the first time there has been a romance on the BBC One reality show. Last year, Jordon Poulton claimed to have sex in cupboard with fellow contestant Luisa Zissman. In an interview with The Sun, the businessman said: 'When I was with Luisa I spent a lot of time in cupboards — literally. It wasn't easy to have sex in the Apprentice house as there were minders living there trying to stop us. 'Our routine was I'd go off somewhere and she'd disappear too, and we'd muck around until someone came to find us. When people try to stop you having sex, the tension ramps up more.' Luisa Zissman, who was the runner up in last year's Apprentice allegedly had sex with fellow candidate Jordan Poulton in a cupboard . In 2011, contestants Glenn Ward and Zoe Beresford reportedly starting dating after filming of the show ended. In 2007, candidate Kristina Grimes claimed a task had been ruined because of a relationship between Katie Hopkins and ex-Army lieutenant, Paul Callaghan. Elsewhere, couple Kate Walsh and Phil Walsh, who met on the 2009 show, are still together.","Apprentice contestants James Hill and Lauren Riley had 'fling' on the show .

"An incompetent crew of thieves left an ATM in ruins after attempting to prise it from the side of a petrol station with a stolen digger. Three crooks took the agricultural vehicle from a building site and drove it to a nearby garage forecourt before ramming the digger's forks into the wall surrounding the cashpoint. They managed to puncture the masonry around the machine but as they tried to yank the ATM free it buckled and broke - with the machine's cash box remaining intact. Mangled: The cashpoint was left in ruins after the failed heist at a petrol station in Co Armagh, Northern Ireland . The bungling thieves were unable to rupture the box and were forced to abandon their raid with the digger still embedded in the wall - having secured no cash. Despite being dangerously close to petrol pumps they torched the digger before jumping in a white van and speeding away. The failed heist took place at 3:30am yesterday in Co Armagh, Northern Ireland. Philip Woods, who runs the petrol station, said: 'It was scary. We are a petrol forecourt and we are pumping fuel 24 hours. 'If the wind had blown in the wrong direction and there had been somebody on the site, who knows what might have happened. It could have been an awful lot worse.' Abandoned: The digger was left at the scene with its forks embedded in the building. The thieves attempted to torch the vehicle before escaping . Scene: The attempted raid took place at 3.30am yesterday and police are appealing for witnesses . Local MP David Simpson added: 'I am particularly thankful to the member of the public who raised the alarm. 'The thieves set fire to the digger in the vicinity of fuel pumps, which clearly could have led to a scene of devastation.' Police are appealing for witnesses. Failed: Despite wrecking the ATM the thieves were unable to rupture its cash box and escaped with no money .","Failed heist happened at petrol station in Co Armagh, Northern Ireland .

"A lapdancer who was earning £150 a night in a strip club carried on claiming benefits - even after she had won thousands in a radio contest. Nikita Baker, of Blackpool, Lancashire, collected £10,000 in cash when she answered a question about Australia on a radio station's phone-in quiz. The mother-of-one pleaded guilty to three offences of failing to notify the authorities of a change in her circumstances. Lapdancer Nikita Baker (pictured) carried on claiming benefits even though she was earning £150 a night in a strip club and had won £10,000 in a radio quiz . She was sentenced to 40 hours unpaid work and ordered to pay a £60 victims' surcharge by Magistrates in Blackpool. Pam Smith, prosecuting, said benefit fraud investigators received a tip-off about Baker and started to look into her lifestyle. They followed her to a club in Carlisle, Cumbria, where she did lap and pole dancing earning £150 a night, the court heard. Investigators also found out she had won £10,000 in July last year by answering a question correctly on a radio station. When she was formally interviewed she admitted how much she earned as a dancer and said she believed she could work sixteen hours a week without disclosing it to the Department of Work and Pensions or her local council. Fraud investigators received a tip-off about Baker (pictured) and followed her to a club in Carlisle, Cumbria where she did lap and pole dancing . She admitted her winnings saying she spent the money on a new car and gave some to her boyfriend. Baker illegally claimed £3,843 in income support, council tax and housing benefit in a one year period. Suzanne Mugford, defending, said her client had co-operated with the investigation. 'She bought the car because she is her mother's carer and needs to drive to her mum's address,' said the lawyer.","Nikita Baker claimed benefits despite earning £150 a night at strip club .

"Residents of a street in Stoke-on-Trent are bracing themselves after a wife from hell who was given an Asbo for repeatedly shouting at her husband moved in next door. Julie Griffiths and long suffering partner Norman caused those living near their former home not far from the city to complain to the local council. Mrs Griffiths, 45, has been taken to court on several occasions for launching loud rants at her other half - earning her the nickname 'nagsbo'. Julie Griffiths, who was given an Asbo for ranting at her husband, has moved into a new home . Those living near her former home in Talke, Staffordshire celebrated last month after it emerged the couple were moving out after more than a decade living in their pink terraced house. Mrs Griffiths was originally handed a five-year Asbo in December 2012 after noise monitoring equipment was installed to measure the volume of her shouting. But she has since been accused of breaching the order, landing her back in court. The Sun reported this morning that residents of another street have now discovered she is moving in. New neighbour James Clarke, 52, told the paper: 'I don't sleep too well as it is, so with them shouting all hours I'll never get a minute's peace. Why don't they get a caravan in some field? That's the best place for them.' Mrs Griffiths' former Staffordshire home, where neighbours complained about her noise . Mrs Griffiths' new neighbours have said they are worried she will keep them awake . Their fears came after former neighbours of Mrs Griffiths were said to be 'popping champagne corks' after she left her former home. Complaints had been made against her moaning since 1999, but it was around thirteen years before she received her Asbo. The ruling prohibited her from creating noise audible to neighbouring properties, shouting, screaming or banging on internal doors and communicating with certain neighbours. Earlier this year she was fined for the noise she made when berating 64-year-old Mr Griffiths for buying the wrong type of scratch card. This was before a third court appearance where she was accused laying into her partner's hygiene. Friends say the couple have been married for more than 20 years but Griffiths' nagging only became an issue three years ago. She has  reportedly been banned from numerous family events because of her tantrums.","Julie Griffiths earned the nickname for loud rants at husband Norman .

"Facebook has come under fire for its election plans to try to encourage voting - and mine its users data for political preferences. The firm announced plans to mine data of millions of American voters, just as an experiment which tried to encourage people to vote was disclosed. The data mining is likely to prove controversial as it adds to the amount Facebook knows about its users - although the company itself says that the data is anonymized before being processed. The move was announced as a controversial 2010 study has been revealed called 'A 61-Million-Person Experiment in Social Influence and Political Mobilization,'. It found that around 20 percent of the users who saw that their friends had voted also clicked on an 'I Voted' button Facebook is set to make available. User data: Facebook says it's mining its users' posts to analyze sentiment regarding candidates and issues for the 2014 and 2016 elections . Earlier this year Facebook issued tough new guidelines on research using its system following outrage from users over experiments on the social network. The firm tightened its research guidelines following uproar over its disclosure this summer that it allowed researchers to manipulate users' feeds to see if their moods could be changed. At issue was study in which Facebook allowed researchers to manipulate the content that appeared in the main section, or 'news feed,' of small fraction of the social network's users. As part of the study, Facebook put different forms of an 'I'm Voting' button on the pages of about 60 million of its American users. Company researchers were testing them to understand the effect of each and to determine how to optimize the tool's impact, according to Mother Jones. Two groups of 600,000 users were left out to serve as a control group—one which saw the 'I'm Voting' button but didn't get any information about their friends' behavior, and one which saw nothing related to voting at all. However, experts have warned the feature could be misused. Jonathan Zittrain, a professor of law and computer science at Harvard University, believes the search giant could even influence the outcome of an election. 'Consider a hypothetical, hotly contested future election,' he wrote in New Republic. 'Suppose that Mark Zuckerberg personally favors whichever candidate you don't like. 'He arranges for a voting prompt to appear within the newsfeeds of tens of millions of active Facebook users, but unlike in the 2010 experiment, the group that will not receive the message is not chosen at random. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg declines to declare how he votes – but he has allied himself with immigration reform, one of the key causes of liberals in America. It is probably the biggest clue to how he thinks politically. He founded an action group which aims to give legal status to 11 million immigrants who do not have official permission to be in the US, an amnesty which is fiercely opposed by conservatives. FWD.us is also supported by Steve Ballmer of Microsoft, Tim Armstrong of AOL and Eric Schmidt of Google. The group aims to mirror the success of Silicon Valley’s new technology with lobbying and activism but has itself been hit by controversy when some liberal supporters quit it over it offering support for a controversial oil pipeline. And he has also criticized surveillance by the NSA and other spy agencies, which resulted in him meeting President Obama to discuss his concerns in March this year. A company spokesman praised the president for his ‘engagement’. Conservatives have also claimed Zuckerberg as one of their own. He has raised money for charter schools in New Jersey alongside its Republic governor Chris Christie. The schools are opposed by liberals who object to teaching unions not being recognized. Zuckerberg himself claims to be ‘post left and right’ and interested in a ‘knowledge economy’. 'Rather, Zuckerberg makes use of the fact that Facebook 'likes' can predict political views and party affiliation, even beyond the many users who proudly advertise those affiliations directly. 'With that knowledge, our hypothetical Zuck chooses not to spice the feeds of users unsympathetic to his views. 'Such machinations then flip the outcome of our hypothetical election. Should the law constrain this kind of behavior? The firm will also collect data on its users in upcoming elections, it revealed today. 'Given the volume of conversation around politics on Facebook, we believe this data truly represents what the American people think about the potential candidates,' said Andy Mitchell Facebook's Director of News and Global Media Partnerships in a statement. Coverage: ABC News, whose 2012 Election Day coverage with Diane Sawyer is pictured here, will use the data in their coverage of the 2014 midterm elections with an eye on contenders for 2016 . The data will be collected and shared with ABC News and BuzzFeed, to be used in 2014 and 2016 Election Day coverage. However, experts have warned the social network could eventually use it to sell targeted advertising - and even influence the outcome of an election. Sociologist Zeynep Tufekci told MailOnline 'Of all the online platforms, Facebook probably has most information about its users. 'Recent research shows that even a slice of Facebook data can reveal a person's political leanings, gender, sexual orientation, race, personality characteristics by datamining their acts on Facebook--in other words, without ever asking the user and even if you have never identified them. The California-based firm carried out its most controversial experiment during a week in 2012. During that time, negative posts were deprioritised in the data feeds of 689,003 users, to see if it generated a more positive response. Posts were determined by the experiment to be positive or negative if they contained at least one positive or negative word. The experiment affected around 0.04 per cent of users - or 1 in 2500. According to Facebook, nobody's posts were 'hidden,' they just didn't show up on some feeds. It found that negative posts elicited a swell of positive responses, but also that a reduction in positive news led to more negative posts. ‘When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred,’ said the researchers. During the weeklong study in January 2012, data-scientists were trying to collect evidence to prove their thesis that people's moods could spread like an 'emotional contagion' depending on what they were reading. 'Although this subject matter was important to research, we were unprepared for the reaction the paper received when it was published and have taken to heart the comments and criticism,' Mike Schroepfer, Facebook's chief technology officer, wrote in a blog post. 'While this particular program is slated as one that anonymizes user data, Facebook has this information and could in the future potentially sell it to political campaigns as a targeting tool. 'Hence, a political campaign could potentially target people of a particular political leaning, personality type, gender, or sexual orientation with targeted ads that would not be visible to anyone else, or nudge to motivate or demotivate a person to vote.' Politico reports that Facebook will glean the data from posts by users in the United States 18 or older and will use sentiment analysis about specific politicians. Sentiment analysis gauges whether a person's opinion about another person or subject is positive, negative or neutral, often by tracking keywords. The analysis looks to be more sophisticated than how media outlets have used Facebook and other social media platforms in the past. The data will be searchable by gender and location, allowing analysis to be done on a state-by-state basis and giving the ability to isolate sentiment about specific issues in primary states like Iowa. Politico reports that Facebook will glean the data from posts by users in the United States 18 or older and will use sentiment analysis about specific politicians.Sentiment analysis gauges whether a person's opinion about another person or subject is positive, negative or neutral, often by tracking keywords. An unnamed Facebook representative said the data 'is gathered in an aggregated and depersonalized manner in a privacy safe way.' ABC News plans to begin using Facebook data next week as part of its 2014 Election Day coverage, paying attention to the potential 2016 candidates. The data will help 'identify the most important trends and the most stimulating conversations happening around the 2016 election cycle,' said ABC News president James Goldston in a statement. Buzzfeed will integrate the data into election stories and use it in their news app, with editor in chief Ben Smith enthusiastic about the Facebook partnership. 'Facebook is going to be a central -- maybe the central -- arena in which political conversation happens in 2016,' he said in a statement. A Pew Research Center poll released last week showed that 48 percent of web users said they consumed news on Facebook while 14 percent got news from YouTube. Twitter came in at 9 percent while Google Plus only had 6 percent of web users reading news on the platform.","The social media site will mine data from users 18 and older, using sentiment analysis and will allow  outlets to sort by categories like gender and location .

"A 13-year-old schoolboy exploded into a 'human fireball' after a piece of broken rope swing he was playing with hit a railway power cable. Kieron Jenkinson suffered burns to 55 per cent of his body after being electrocuted with 25,000 volts as he crossed a railway bridge in Ayrshire, Scotland. A witness said the explosion could be seen 'from half a mile away' as two adults rushed to the scene to put out the flames and wait for an ambulance to arrive. Kieron Jenkinson, 13, has suffered 55 per cent burns to his body after a piece of broken rope swing he was playing with hit railway power cables . Witnesses said Kieron turned into a 'human fireball' after he was struck with 25,000 volts. His sister Lisa, 24 (right), rushed to the scene after seeing messages on Facebook, but he had already been taken to hospital . Kieron has since had two major operations and is expected to remain in a coma for several days in hospital, where his condition is described as serious but stable. The accident happened on Tuesday night after Kieron and a friend had been playing on a rope swing which broke. The pair then took the broken rope with them as they crossed a railway bridge. As Kieron played with it, the rope hit some railway power lines, causing him to burst into flames. People living near to the line described hearing a loud bang, followed by darkness as the power surge caused lights to go out. Kieron was found groaning on the ground by two passersby who called the emergency services. His sister Lisa, 24, learned of the accident after seeing posts on Facebook at around 7.40pm but by the time she arrived at the scene, Kieron was already gone. Kieron was taken to hospital where doctors performed two major surgeries, one to release a build-up of blood in his leg. He is expected to remain in a coma until Saturday at the earliest . His mother, Donna Graham, 50, told the Daily Record: 'The police came to the door just after 8pm and told me Kieron was seriously injured and took me to the hospital. We have all been in pieces. 'The officer said he had never seen in his 28 years of service someone being able to speak after that amount of voltage went through him. He is obviously a real fighter.' Kieron was taken to nearby Crosshouse hospital before being transferred to Glasgow Royal Infirmary where doctors performed two major surgeries, one to release a build-up of blood in his leg which could have developed into a serious clot. The schoolboy, who attends Ardrossan Academy and is an avid football fan, is expected to remain in a coma until Saturday at the earliest. Ms Graham said that doctors are still assessing damage to her son's internal organs, and described his recovery as a 'long haul.' She is also trying to identify a man and woman who stopped to help Kieron, adding that the knowledge he wasn't alone was a comfort to her. British Transport Police are investigating the incident and are urging anyone who witnessed the accident to come forward. People living close to this railway bridge in Ayrshire, where Kieron was hurt, reported hearing a loud bang when the accident happened on Tuesday night . A man and a woman rushed to the scene where they found Kieron groaning on the floor.

"Cara Perrett has many friends in London but her visit to the capital this month will not be easy. ‘I find it difficult coming back now,’ she says. ‘Which is a shame, as I lived there for ten years and have lots of friends whom I miss.’ The source of her fear is not crime or terrorism or crowds, but something that we all take for granted: the pavement beneath our feet. Two years ago, in May 2012, Mrs Perrett, a barrister, was walking home along the Edgware Road in North-West London when she was engulfed by a fireball erupting from the ground. Scroll down for video . Life-endangering: A huge manhole explosion shatters the pavement and sets fire to the front of a shop in Pimlico, central London . ‘I was in shock, I was terrified,’ she remembers. ‘The back of my dress and tights were blown off. The tips of my fingers had all but disappeared behind these hard fleshy barnacles that formed at the end of my fingers.’ Mrs Perrett suffered severe burns in the explosion, caused by a spark from a faulty electricity cable which then ignited leaking gas. The physical scars remain to this day, but it is the mental scars that are more troubling – fears of the everyday caused by a sudden, terrifying event in the most mundane of settings. Pavement explosions, rare and potentially fatal events, are getting less rare. Figures to September show that so far this year, there have been 124 serious manhole fires involving faulty electric cables and junction boxes in Britain, compared to 34 in 2010. The overwhelming majority - 113 - have occurred in the South East of England, but serious incidents have been recorded over the past few years in Birmingham, Nottingham, Liverpool and, just last month, Aberdeen. The culprit appears to be the age of the country’s network of underground electricity distribution cables, combined with - or so the half-dozen electricity distribution companies claim - the vagaries of the British weather. Shocking: An enormous cloud of smoke rises into the air as a manhole fire rages outside a home in Hackbridge, Surrey . Two very wet winters, it seems, have resulted in water seeping into link (junction) boxes, with delayed but serious consequences. What the distribution companies are less keen to advertise is a previously haphazard inspection regime that has taken second place to reaping massive profits from their regional monopolies. That regime is now coming under close scrutiny, with the Health and Safety Executive warning UK Power Networks (UKPN), which distributes electricity to London and the South East, to improve its safety record. Mrs Perrett, 34, who now lives in Switzerland, is one of those pushing for better safety standards via an online petition. ‘The psychological injury was much worse,’ she says. ‘I coped well with the aftermath of the explosion and thought I was going to be OK. But ten or so months after the explosion I was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and related depression.’ Two other people were injured in the explosion, one woman sustaining injuries even more serious than those of Mrs Perrett. Blast: A fire engine was called out after an explosion tore though the pavement in Islington, north London . ‘The main problem, apart from the more obvious side-effects, such as being terrified of loud noises and, indeed, any reminders of that day, was an almost crippling sense of guilt,’ she says. ‘It started when the memory came back to me of running past the woman who had been even more seriously injured. In my panic, I thought there had been a terrorist attack and was worried about another bomb, so I ran for my life. ‘Afterwards, I started to question whether I should have stopped to help the other woman, whether I had a right to save myself without giving thought to anyone else.’ Exploding pavements may be a nationwide problem but the risk is greatest by far in London. Sixty-four of the 113 serious incidents in the UKPN area so far this year have occurred in the capital, an average of almost two a week. In February, some 50 homes in Islington, North London, were evacuated when an electrical fire burst out into a busy shopping area. Then, in July, a lorry was engulfed in flames by a manhole explosion in Piccadilly. Only last month, flames erupted from a manhole cover by commuters on Old Brompton Road, South Kensington. Colin Wingate was visiting friends in Harrow, North London, in August 2011 when he was thrown off his feet by a manhole explosion. ‘I had one foot on the manhole cover and I was thrown into the air,’ remembers Mr Wingate, who is 76 and lives in Bournemouth. ‘My friend, who was a few feet away, was knocked sideways off his feet. ‘The noise was deafening and I wasn’t sure of what was going on. But I remember being in a huge amount of pain. I had a huge gash in my leg and the tendons all around my knee were severed. I later found out that one of the people who had called 999 had told them: “Send everything!” because they thought a bomb had gone off. ‘Sooner or later, there is going to be a serious injury or, God forbid, a death. It’s only a matter of time. It’s as if the threat is not being taken seriously.’ When questioned by a Westminster City Council committee about the increase in explosions in the local authority area, Basil Scarsella, chief executive of UKPN, the man responsible for 22,000 miles of cable in London, claimed it was ‘impossible’ to stop more explosions, pinning much of the blame on wet weather. Lucky: Miraculously nobody was killed when a pavement explosion in Piccadilly, central London, set fire to a lorry in July . Rain has not stopped play when it comes to profits, however. UKPN made close to £1 billion for its Hong Kong-based owners in 2012. The company was later fined for its slow response to power cuts caused by last winter’s flooding. ‘There is some evidence that the age of the asset is a contributor,’ Mr Scarsella told the council committee. ‘But more important is the increase in the amount of rain.’ Some councillors were unconvinced by Mr Scarsella, who earns £1.7 million a year. They pointed out that the past two summers had been among the driest on record. ‘It is more by luck than planning that we haven’t had any serious injuries,’ said Ian Adams, chairman of Westminster’s environment committee. John Steed, a senior officer at the Health and Safety Executive, says he has warned UKPN to improve its act. ‘Earlier this year we twice had directors of UK Power Networks in and said: “Look, we’re not happy about this increase [in manhole incidents], what are you doing about this?” ‘They told us: “We are doing this,” - they thought they were doing enough. And I told them: “No, you’re not doing enough.” ’ Horror: Two people watch in disbelief as the pavement they were seconds away from treading on suddenly ignites in Peterborough . Mr Steed agrees water plays a major role in manhole fires, and also points to disruption caused by the digging up of pavements by various bodies. But he adds: ‘Ageing is very much an issue. Most of the network was laid in the 1950s and 1960s. It is difficult, if not impossible, to look at these link boxes and know exactly what stage they have reached in terms of deterioration. The best solution, probably, is to replace them on a regular basis.’ The Energy Networks Association, the voice of the electricity distribution industry, places part of the blame on increasing amounts of ‘street furniture’ and associated excavations. ‘The cables under the pavement are very robust and hardly ever fail on their own,’ says a spokesman, ‘so the main reasons for these incidents are a combination of external damage by third parties, vandalism and two of the wettest winters on record.’ For its part, UKPN says it is addressing the problem with more frequent, detailed inspections and a rolling programme to replace link boxes. ‘We are investing more than £10 million this year and will spend £80 million over the next eight years to ensure that our safety procedures remain robust,’ says a spokesman. ‘To keep London powered, we have over 100,000 cable boxes and cable pits, as well as 22,000 miles of cables under the streets, and there are relatively few cases where our equipment has faulted.’ Over the last few years, he adds, it has installed thousands of new link boxes, at a cost of almost £40 million. UKPN says it is limited in what it can spend on infrastructure by Ofgem, the Government regulator — said to be anxious to minimise the impact of such spending on electricity bill payers. But Ofgem is understood to dispute any suggestion that it is preventing UKPN from pursuing its safety programme. ‘We have been and will continue to monitor the faults that UKPN have been experiencing,’ says a spokesman. All too late for Cara Perrett. UKPN admitted joint liability for her injuries, together with a gas company, and has now settled her claim, the details of which remain confidential. ‘I am not convinced that the industry is taking this problem seriously enough,’ she says. ‘Why can’t they sort it out more quickly? Why can’t they be made to do so? The right to walk safely down our public pavements is surely a fundamental principle of any civilised society. ‘The question has to be asked, are they more concerned about their profits than people’s safety?’","Number of serious incidents has risen from 34 in 2010 to 124 in the last year .

"Doctors marveled at the Ohio teacher whose skull was shattered when teens allegedly tossed a 5-pound rock off an overpass as she left the hospital after just three months. It was an impressively short stay for Sharon Budd, a middle school teacher and breast cancer survivor, who endured five surgical procedures to repair the damage - including the removal of a portion of her facial bones to ease the brain swelling. While recuperating at Geisinger HealthSouth Rehabilitation Hospital in Danville, Pennsylvania, Budd's upbeat survivor's spirit left a huge impression on caregivers. 'She’s just improved by leaps and bounds. She’s walking all over the facility. She walks in and lights up every room. She has such a great personality and is such a pleasure to work with,' Sharon’s physical therapist Chelsea Matukaitis told WNEP. Celebration: Sharon Budd rings a ceremonial victory bell outside Geisinger HealthSouth Rehabilitation Hospital in Danville, Pennsylvania on Tuesday - signaling that she is ready to return home after three months . For her part, though, Sharon remained modest even as medical staff and relatives gushed about her recovery outside the health center, where the 52-year-old mother rang a ceremonial bell, as is tradition for patients who've fought long battles there. 'Just unbelievable that that many people know who I am and know the story and things,' but, she said, she's 'very excited about going home.' Her husband, too, marveled at Sharon's recovery. 'She’s so strong and I don’t know how she did it. To be able to walk out there and answer these questions out here in front of everyone is a miracle,' Randy Budd said. Helped by two staff members, she grinned as she rang the ceremonial victory bell. The couple planned to return home to Uniontown, Ohio on Wednesday. On the road to recovery: Mrs Budd has been recovering for three months after a rock was thrown from an Interstate 80 overpass in Pennsylvania and shattered her skull. She lost her right eye in the incident . When previously asked what was the first thing she wanted when she got home, she told PennLive: 'A loaf of bread and an entire package of English muffins. I'll stand by the toaster for an hour and a half.' She was the front-seat passenger of her family's car as it drove through Danville on July 10 with her husband and daughter, when the rock crashed through the front window and struck her head. Budd, who had just finished speaking to her son before he was deployed to Afghanistan, suffered a crushed skull and brain damage. She also lost her right eye. She has  - but has suffered setbacks with seizures. Support: She is pictured with her husband Randy ahead of her departure from the rehab center . Excitement: Randy Budd speaks to his wife on Tuesday as she prepares to head back home to Ohio . Strength-to-strength: Mrs Budd suffered brain damage but is able to manage simple math, her husband said . Her husband said on Tuesday that her sense of humor has returned, she is able to walk and she has regained limited vision in her left eye. Her long-term prognosis remains uncertain. 'They told us to look at this a year from now to give a measurement of how Sharon's going to be, who is Sharon going to be,' Randy Budd said. She can perform simple math and knows who the president is and that it's 2014, Randy Budd said. But she can be confused about how many children she has or how she got hurt, he said. 'Some basics, she doesn't have,' Randy Budd said. 'That's to be expected. The brain has to reconnect itself.' But there are encouraging signs so far, he said: 'She could have come back bitter, violent, aggressive, but she came back as kind of her sweet self.' Life-changing: Sharon is pictured left with her husband Randy and right before the July 10 crash in Danville . Injuries: A scan shows how Mrs Budd's skull was shattered after she was hit by the massive rock . By her side: An image shared by family shows the Budds dancing in Sharon's hospital room in September . 'This word gets thrown around a lot, but I really believe the angels came down to help her,' he said. Four young men face charges in the attack. One of them testified at a preliminary hearing in August that they set out to do damage that day, starting with shoplifting and driving through a corn field and ending up on the Interstate 80 overpass shortly before midnight. Keefer McGee, 18, testified under a deal with prosecutors that they laughed as they drove away from the scene after hearing the noise of the rock hitting the Budd family's vehicle. Proud: Sharon Budd, left, was struck by a rock thrown from an overpass as her family drove on I-80. Moments before, she had spoken with her son Lucas (right), who has been deployed to Afghanistan . Fighter: Mrs Budd, pictured with her husband, three sons and a daughter, will return to Ohio on Wednesday . 'They weren't looking for a car to hit in particular,' said McGee, who told the judge he had been involved in unspecified earlier rock-throwing incidents. 'Like, they weren't waiting for one. They hit one as they saw it.' He drove them back to the Lahr home, where they began to watch a movie before deciding to return to the scene to see what happened — twice. During one of those trips, an alert police officer noted their license plate, leading investigators to the four. Budd's husband Randy recalled the horror of that evening during the hearing. 'It felt like an explosion,' he testified, calling his wife's injuries the 'most gruesome thing that I've ever seen.' 'I'm pretty sure I was looking at brains and skull and she, remarkably, kind of came to but wasn't saying anything,' he said. 'She was just jerking, grabbing her head, so we were holding her hands down.' Accused: Brett Lahr, 18, left, and his brother, 17-year-old Dylan Lahr, and two others have been charged with aggravated assault and conspiracy charges in the shocking incident three months ago . One of the four told police that the oblong-shaped rock was dropped by Dylan Lahr, 17. The lawyer for the only defendant who did not waive his preliminary hearing, Brett Lahr, 19, said this week he was glad to hear Sharon Budd was being released but maintains criminal charges should not have been filed against him. 'Just because you're riding along with people who do some stuff, and even alleged to have laughed if it happened, which we dispute, does not mean you should be even tried for a crime,' said the defense attorney, Brian Manchester. 'You have to have some active involvement.'","Sharon Budd was in the front passenger seat as she traveled through Pennsylvania with her husband and daughter on July 10 .

"A talented teenage sailor, who killed herself the day after her birthday, had been taking an acne drug which has been linked to depression. Jessica Eales had recently represented Great Britain at the Isaf Youth Sailing World Championships in Tavira, Portugal, where she finished 11th. She was found hanged in woodland in July at Sway in the New Forest in Hampshire, about a mile-and-a-half from her family home in Lymington, the day after her 17th birthday. Jess Eales, 17, from Lymington, Hampshire, was found dead weeks after representing Great Britain in sailing . An inquest following her death found that the medal-winning sailor and straight-A student had been taking Dianette, a hormone treatment for acne, before she died. One of the drug's listed side-effects is depression. The teenager's family have since asked their daughter's GP to 'yellow flag' the drug to highlight it for further research into the 'well-documented' side effects of depression. The inquest heard she had left a handwritten note in her bedroom saying 'I am sorry, I love you with all my heart XXXX'. When she was found it was discovered she had been listening to music. Her rucksack contained a half empty bottle of gin and a bottle of alcohol although toxicology tests showed a low alcohol level in her blood which made it uncertain whether she had been been drinking. Jessica had spent her 17th birthday with friends on a boat and had uploaded a picture of herself smiling on the day she died. This has now been 'liked' by dozens of people. She had recently won a gold medal at the Royal Yachting Association (RYA) Youth National Championships in Weymouth and Portland, Dorset. Friends said she had been happy and had been talking about her future before she died, and was a popular girl . The inquest at Winchester, attended by Jessica's grandparents, heard she was a happy girl who had been successful both in sailing as well as in her studies and she hoped to go to university to study science. In a statement read to the hearing, her father Nicholas Eales said: 'Jess was a happy girl who enjoyed her formative years doing all the normal activity associated with growing up.' He said that sailing became the sport of her life and described her success in Portugal as the 'best two weeks of her life'. He added: 'Often described as academically-gifted, her achievements were the result of her dedication and sheer hard work.' Mr Eales also raised his concerns about Dianette. The statement added: 'Jess was taking Dianette that was prescribed to her four months earlier. From research it appears serious concerns have been raised about the serious and well-documented side-effect of depression. 'The family have asked that this drug is yellow-flagged as a result.' This means the drug will be highlighted for research into the possible side effects of the drug. Dianette is a contraceptive pill that is often prescribed to women to treat acne . It is banned in some parts of Europe and has been linked to the death of seven British women . Six of the deaths were attributed to blood clots and one to a fall . Dianette is prescribed to more than 62,000 British women a year, usually for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) In Britain there have been more than 80 reports of women suffering side effects such as hair loss and depression after taking it . Last year France suspended use of the pill while European Medicines Agency investigated its side effects . Charlotte Porter died from deep vein thrombosis. The coroner said Dianette was a contributory factor . Dianette, also known as Diane 35, is banned in Canada and Japan, and under review in Australia . In 2013 doctors said they suspected the drug was linked to the stroke suffered by Angela Macleod when she was just 29 . Dianette is a combination of two drugs - cyproterone (a form of the female hormone progesterone) and ethinylestradiol (an oestrogen) It has one of the highest risks of blood clots of all oral contraceptives, however the risk is still small . Charlotte Porter, 17, from Allington, near Maidstone, Kent, died in March 2010 of a deep-vein thrombosis after taking Dianette for acne. The coroner said it was the largest clot he had ever seen in someone so young and that the drug had been a contributory factor in the teenager's death . The Porter family has launched a petition to ban the drug . On her birthday Jessica took her boat out to the Isle of Wight where she had a picnic with three friends and her family before going to a pizza restaurant in the evening in Lymington. Friend and sailing companion Jess Hammett said in her statement that she had no idea why Jessica took her own life. She said: 'Jess was a popular girl, at the sailing club she had a lot of friends. She was also very clever.' Miss Hammett, who was staying with Jessica on the day of her death, described how she had formed her first relationship with a boy while in Portugal and had appeared upset that he had not contacted her during her birthday. She said: 'Jess was happy and she said she had her three best friends with her. I could tell she was disappointed she hadn't heard from the boy and she kept checking her phone but she was still happy.' The teenager said she had been unable to answer why her friend would have wanted to take her own life, and said she had been happy and had previously talked about the future. She added: 'Although she was sad she hadn't heard from her boyfriend the night before, she knew it wasn't serious because he lived abroad.' Graham Short, coroner for North Hampshire, recorded a verdict that Jessica took her own life and said that he could not establish a link between the acne drug and her actions. He said: 'I know the family is concerned about the drug Dianette. I have considered whether Jess was affected by that and whether or not it caused her to be depressed. 'I accept that there are reports of people taking the drug who have complained of depression and the leaflets issued by the manufacturers do give information about that. 'However, Jessica had been prescribed Dianette for over six months and had apparently been taking that without any indication of depressions and none of her friends or family seem to have noticed she had suffered from depression. 'I therefore cannot find a link between the drug and her action to end her life.' Jessica had been taking Dianette for four months before she killed herself, the drug has depression as a side effect. However the coroner said he could not find a link between Jessica's suicide and her taking it . Jessica was a straight A student and hoped to go to University and her father said sailing was 'sport of her life' He added: 'I cannot establish what was in her mind, I can well understand her parents have been racking their brains to understand as well. 'However I think we shouldn't underestimate the pressures on teenagers, particularly high achievers like Jess and the sad part is that she felt unable to share these worries with her family and indeed her friends before she reached the decision to hang herself and it's a tragedy for all concerned, for the sailing community, her friends but most importantly her family.' Jessica, a student at Brockenhurst College in the New Forest, learned to sail in 2009 before becoming a member of Hayling Island Sailing Club. Her parents, Nicholas and Annette Eales, arealso keen sailors, run a marine breakdown assistance company called Sea Start. She has a brother, James, 14. Dozens of tributes have been paid to the teenager by the sailing community. RYA youth racing manager Mark Nicholls said: 'The RYA is aware of the sad passing of British Youth Sailing Squad member Jessica Eales. Jessica was found dead at woodland in the New Forest, near her home in Lymington, the day after her birthday . 'She was a young sailor who showed promising talent which can now unfortunately never be fulfilled. Our thoughts are with the family and friends at this sad and difficult time.' Jessica was a member of Royal Lymington Yacht Club (RLYC) and the Hayling Island Sailing Club. A statement on the RS Feva Association website said: 'Jess was a well-known and popular HISC/Royal Lymington YC youth sailor, and will be greatly missed. 'Jess was a leading light in the 29er fleet. Having progressed from the RS Feva fleet, she had recently been selected for the Isaf youth worlds, sailing an SL16. 'Our thoughts and hearts are with Jess's family and friends at this sad time.'

"Desk belonged to King Louis XV most famous royal mistress Madame de Pompadour . Furniture dating back to 1757 set to make between £3-5m when it goes under the hammer at Christie's . Madame de Pompadour was once one of the most powerful women in 18th century France thanks to her long-standing affair with King Louis XV. And while the monarch could not make her his wife, the king wanted to ensure his royal mistress lived in an opulent Versailles apartment decked out in the finest furniture. Now two items that once took pride of place in the rooms of Madame de Pompadour are going under the hammer at London auction house Christie's. Going under the hammer: Madame de Pompadour's desk from which she could have written to the King and kept her most private documents . Expensive taste: A desk with gold coloured leafing and Japanese style pannelling is expected to fetch between £3-5million . A desk with a fold down table and lockable draws is expected to fetch between £3-5million while a bureau is valued between £2-4m. The desk could have been where Madame de Pompadour, who was born Jeanne Antoinette Poisson but given a title by the king after he fell for her charms, penned intimate love letters to her royal beau and kept her most private documents. Historic: The desk was seen in Madame de Pompadour's apartment in 1757 . Christie's treasure: Along with a bureau in the same design, this rare item of furniture will go on sale on Thursday at the London auction house . Renowned designer Lazare Duvaux noted in his journal seeing the desk in the apartment of the famous mistress in 1757. She was famed for her exquisite taste in art and design which is evident in the luxurious pieces that will go on sale on the evening of Thursday, 6 December. The lacquer furniture by Bernard II van Risenburgh is decorated with gold colour leaf detailing and Japanese designs in porcelain plaques. Adored: Madame de Pompadour, as depicted in a painting by Francois Boucher, captured the heart of the married king so he made her his royal mistress . The style and design of the pieces is said to be extremely rare, with the only comparable bureau currently in the Royal Collection, in Queen Elizabeth II's private apartments at Windsor. After Madame . de Pompadour's death in 1764, the furniture came to the UK and formed . part of the collection of Dukes of Richmond at Goodwood House, Sussex, . where it remained until 1993. It was then owned by Monsieur and Madame Riahi who are now auctioning it off along with a number of other rare items from their collection. A portrait of Madame de Pompadour in her twilight years . Madame de Pompadour came from  bourgeoisie beginnings to become one of the most powerful woman in 18th century France. She was named Jeanne Antoinette Poisson when she was born in 1721 and was the illegitimate daughter of a financier exiled for fraud. She was well-educated as her mother hoped that would help her secure a rich husband. She married Charles Guillaume le Normant d'Etoiles in 1741 but they separated legally in 1745 when the king pronounced her the Marquise de Pompadour - his official mistress. The monarch had fallen for her after meeting her at a ball that year. He moved her into an apartment in the Château de Versailles above his own with a secret stairway so he could visit her whenever he wanted. As the pair got older, their relationship became platonic but she still acted as one of his main advisors until her death in 1764 - with many blaming her ill-advised foreign policy for the Seven Years' War.","Desk belonged to King Louis XV most famous royal mistress Madame de Pompadour .

"This is the tear jerking moment when a dying cancer patient's final wish came true and she was reunited with her beloved horse. Grandmother Sheila Marsh was wheeled out of Wigan Royal Infirmary in her hospital bed so she could say goodbye  to her cherished steed. The mare, named Bronwen, gently nuzzled up to her loving owner of 25 years after nurses arranged for the animal to be transported to the hospital. The frail 77-year-old lost her fight against the disease just hours after the loving meeting that reduced medics to tears. Final Goodbye: Sheila Marsh was reunited with her beloved horse, Bronwen, in the car park of Wigan Royal Infirmary hours before she lost her fight against cancer . Today her family praised hospital staff and said the loving farewell gave  Mrs Marsh comfort in her final hours. Hospital bosses arranged for the horse to be transported to Wigan Royal Infirmary after Mrs Marsh's condition deteriorated. 'I was crying my eyes out and all the nurses were crying too,' said her daughter Tina, aged 33 years. 'She took comfort out of it and it was a beautiful moment.' Mum-of-two Mrs Marsh, who lived in Bickershaw, Wigan, had a life-long affiliation with horses and used to work at Haydock Park Racecourse. Bosses at Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh NHS Foundation Trust said they acted on grandmother-of-four's express wishes. Her daughter said: 'She loved her horses and she loved and adored all animals. She had six horses, three dogs, three cats and other animals. 'Her condition did not get any better and the hospital allowed us to bring Bronwen in. It was a matter of hours later that she passed away. I want to thank the hospital and all the nurses. 'It was very important for my mum. She was one of the most hard-working people that you could meet and she would do anything for anyone.' Mrs Marsh had raised Bronwen over 25 years from a foal. Gail Taylor, bereavement liaison specialist nurse, said: 'We listened and acted on Mrs Marsh's last wishes. Staff at Wigan Royal Infirmary said they acted on the 'last wishes' of dying Sheila Marsh by arranging the final loving meeting with her horse . 'I was crying my eyes out and all the nurses were crying too,' said her daughter Tina, aged 33 years . 'Sheila gently called to Bronwen and the horse bent down tenderly and kissed her on the cheek as they said their last goodbyes.' Pauline Law, deputy director of nursing, added: 'I am really pleased to have been able to facilitate the visit from Mrs Marsh's horse. This was obviously extremely important to her and her family and we feel privileged to have been able to provide this support at this crucial stage of her care. 'It is absolutely right that we should pull out all the stops to ensure that our patients and their families receive personalised, compassionate and dignified care at the end of their life and this is what we will always strive to achieve.'

"A new record-breaking atomic clock is so precise it neither loses nor gains a second in five billion years - longer than the age of the Earth. The 'strontium lattice clock' is 50% more accurate than the previous record holder, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) quantum logic clock. Researchers say the clock is so accurate, it can even reveal the effect gravity has on time. Atomic clocks operate by means of atoms oscillating between two energy levels. In the strontium lattice clock, a few thousand atoms of strontium are held in a column of laser optical traps (pictured). Atomic clocks operate by means of atoms oscillating between two energy levels. In the strontium lattice clock, a few thousand atoms of strontium are held in a column of laser optical traps. Scientists detect the clock's 'ticks' - 430 trillion of them a second - by bathing the atoms in very stable red laser light. The precise frequency of the laser trigger prompts the switch between energy levels. The clock was developed in the US at the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics (JILA), by a team from NIST and the University of Colorado. Group leader Dr Jun Ye said when it was unveiled in Nature earlier this year: 'We already have plans to push the performance even more. 'So in this sense, even this new Nature paper represents only a 'mid-term' report. 'You can expect more new breakthroughs in our clocks in the next five to 10 years.' In terms of stability, the new clock equals the performance of NIST's world-leading ytterbium atomic clock. Atomic clocks operate by means of atoms oscillating between two energy levels.

Scientists detect the clock's 'ticks' - 430 trillion of them a second - by bathing the atoms in very stable red laser light. The precise frequency of the laser trigger prompts the switch between energy levels. 'Our aim is that we'll have a clock that, during the entire age of the universe, would not have lost a second,' Ye told NPR. However, the clock has hit a snag - time doesn't pass at the same rate everywhere on Earth. The watch of the future? US scientists say the 'strontium lattice clock' is 50% more accurate than the previous record holder, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) quantum logic clock. The speed at which time passes depends on the strength of gravity, part of Einstein's theory of relativity, and it is a very real effect. If you take a clock off the floor, and hang it on the wall, Ye says, 'the time will speed up by about one part in 1016.' The new clock, however, is sensitive enough to spot this. 'Lift it just a couple of centimeters and you will start to see that difference,' Ye says. 'At this level, maintaining absolute time scale on earth is in fact turning into nightmare. 'This clock they've built doesn't just look chaotic. It is turning our sense of time into chaos.' The answer, Ye claims, is to send these new clocks into space.","Clock will remain accurate longer than the age of Earth .

"Back home, when Luis Suarez did what we always knew Luis Suarez would do, 50 million Englishmen would have given everything to wipe that smile off his face. Sadly, the 11 on the pitch in the Arena Sao Paulo did not have the same idea. You could even make a case that they had no idea. England’s defence was dysfunctional and disorganised, brutally exposed at the very highest level of the game. Suarez picked them off, scoring two magnificent goals on a magical night for his country. Good for him. England were petrified by his sheer presence on the field after five weeks out through injury. Yes he’s world class and yes it’s your job to stop him. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Suarez's emotional dressing room message for wife and kids . Tormentor: Luis Suarez was the star of the show as Uruguay beat England in Sao Paulo . Helpless: England's defence had no answer to a top-class striker for the second game in a row . Too hot to handle: Italy's Mario Balotelli posed England with a lot of problems in Manaus . England’s defending for the Uruguay’s opening goal was abject, a depressing re-run of Mario Balotelli’s header in Manaus on Saturday. Allowing Suarez to run through unchecked to score their winner five minutes from time is worthy of an FA inquiry.  What were they doing? Maybe we will never know. The FA will be willing the country to forgive and forget, to learn from our mistakes so that we can all be one big happy family at the next tournament. No chance, not after this. England are as good as out of the World Cup in Brazil and that is unacceptable. Roy Hodgson has blown this. Big time. Every time Phil Jagielka made a mistake in the first half, a Uruguayan player was all over him. Cavani, Suarez, Rodriguez... take your pick.  If your name is Franco Baresi or Franz Beckenbauer then you’ve earned the right to pull out the Cruyff turn on the halfway line when there isn’t a covering defender.  You don’t try that sort of stunt if you’re Phil Jagielka. Finish: Suarez headed past Joe Hart to give Uruguay the lead in the first half . On the prowl: The Liverpool striker escaped the attention of Phil Jagielka to give Uruguay the lead . That terrifying moment was at the start of the first half and set the tone for some defending that, quite frankly, deserved to be punished. At times they were powerless to stop the little exchanges, the knitted passes between Cavani, Suarez and Lodeiro. That trio has the ability to pull any defence apart and England’s threatened to oblige every time the outstanding midfielder Egidio Arevalo was on the ball. Hodgson had promised to work on England’s defensive frailties after the 2-1 defeat against Italy in the opening group game in Manaus. In reality England’s head coach had just one full day back at their Urca training base in Rio de Janeiro to work on specific details. It’s no time at all. Frail: Roy Hodgson didn't have enough time to correct the defensive faults from England's loss to Italy . Back with a bang: Suarez, who missed Uruguay's opening game, celebrates his first goal in Sao Paulo . Lifeline: Wayne Rooney tapped in Glen Johnson's cross to equalise for England . They were scared witless of Suarez, even after five weeks without a game because of the knee injury that ruled him out of Uruguay’s 3-1 defeat against Costa Rica. He was short of match practice and high on energy, fuelled by the burning desire to score against a side with five of his Liverpool team-mates starting for England.  Those who want to move on from the John Terry and Rio Ferdinand era are well within their rights and will point to England’s defensive record in the qualifiers. It was there, in ten games against Ukraine, Montenegro, Poland, Moldova and San Marino, that they conceded just four goals. Well bully for them.  This is the elite level, a World Cup in Brazil and we won’t be back here again in our lifetime. Mistakes are punished. This is a tournament where several hundred million people around the world are watching each game and dissecting every aspect of every game. This is the World Cup, that’s what happens, learn to live with it. There have been complaints that there has been too much attention, too many demands and too much expectation on the team. Please. This is the elite level, where the best players in the world remind their countrymen watching on TV sets back in Montevideo, Salto or Paysandu just how good they are. Heart breaker: Suarez scored his second and the winner for Uruguay with five minutes to play . Delight: The Uruguayan striker lets out a roar after scoring the decisive goal in Sao Paulo . Contrast: The South Americans celebrate in front of a dejected Rooney and Johnson . This is a World Cup group game in Brazil, boys, and the south American teams will fight to the death for the right to stay here until the bitter end. When Suarez slips on that blue number nine shirt to play for his country after five weeks without a game, he grows as a man and scores glorious goal. Just like the two he scored here.  Some of these games are won in the tunnel or when Uruguay’s national anthem, Orientales, la Patrias o la Tumba, is belted out before kick off. England had enough tub-thumpers in their team, with Joe Hart running over to the England supporters behind the goal just before kick off, urging them to get behind their team. After this, they should be running for cover.","Luis Suarez scores both goals as Uruguay defeat England 2-1 in Sao Paulo .

"A 47-year-old Tulsa man has been arrested for felony child neglect after police were called to his home to find three young children naked and in various states of distress, while he was passed out on a bed. After hearing a child crying outside for over 20 minutes on Sunday evening, a neighbor went to investigate what was happening outside William Todd Lewallen's residence. The man found the child, who was naked, and knocked on Lewallen’s front door. When no one answered, the neighbor took the child to . his house and called the police. William Todd Lewallen told police he had taken narcotic pain medicine, a muscle relaxant and an anti-seizure medication, then 'laid down to take a rest' Police spotted a naked 18-month-old girl locked in this metal dog kennel and covered in her own feces . 'When officers arrived they spoke with the neighbor and investigated further,' said Officer Leland Ashley of the Tulsa Police Department. 'As they approached the house they could hear screaming and crying coming from inside.' Spotting a naked child locked in a metal dog crate, police kicked open the back door and removed a 18-month-old girl from the kennel. She was covered in her own feces. 'Upon entry officers were immediately hit with the overwhelming stench of feces,' Ashley said. A third child, a 3-year-old - also naked - was found asleep in a bed in the master bedroom, along with Lewallen, who was passed out. Once awoken, Lewallen told police that had taken narcotic pain medicine, a muscle relaxant and an anti-seizure medication, then 'laid down to take a rest.' Squalor: Officers investigating the call from a neighbor found Lewallen passed out in the master bedroom, and one of the children locked in a cage in the messy home . A neighbor found a naked toddler locked outside of this Tulsa house on Sunday evening, while father William Todd Lewallen was inside . Officers also spotted an open can of beer next to the bed. 'The defendant was unaware that a naked child had been locked out of his house and was outside in the 40 degree weather for over 20 minutes,' the arrest report states. 'The screaming child in the dog kennel did not wake the defendant nor did the officers kicking the door down to rescue the toddler in the dog cage.' The three children are now in Department of Human Services custody. The incident occured on the 4900 block of North Frankfort Place just before 6 p.m. on Sunday . Lewallen remains at the Tulsa Jail in lieu of $50,000 bond on a complaint of child abuse by neglect. His next court date is set for November 19, 2012. Since 1989, Lewallen has been named in eight felony cases in four counties. He was to remain on probation until December 2013 after being convicted of second-degree burglary in Osage County in 2003, reports Tulsaworld. In August, he was given a suspended sentence after pleading guilty to a Tulsa County charge filed last year of possessing a precursor with intent to manufacture methamphetamine.","One child was found crying by a neighbor, naked and locked out of the family home .

"A lifelong San Francisco Giants fan had a piece of team history in his hands after Thursday's game: the walk-off home-run ball that sent the Giants to the World Series. Then he gave it back. Frank Burke, who owns a transmission repair business in Oakdale told the San Jose Mercury News  that he wanted the hitter, Travis Ishikawa, to have the ball.

So after having it authenticated by a Giants official and learning Ishikawa wanted it back, Burke went down to the clubhouse area and handed it over. Ishikawa gave him a signed bat in return. Burke said he had asked for World Series tickets, but was told that might not be possible. 'So I said, `All right. I was going to give the ball back either way,' he said. I tried to have soft hands. It bounced out on the roof. I snatched it up as soon as it hit. I was afraid it would go back on the field,'Burke told News 10 of catching the ball.

He wanted to do something special for Leutza and went searching for tickets after the Giants clinched the National League Division Series, he told another newspaper, the Modesto Bee. Ishikawa's drive came their way as they sat above the stadium's right field wall in the bottom of the ninth inning with two Giants on base. 'My main thought was to keep it in front of me and don't let it fall to the field,' Burke told the Bee. The ball went off his left hand, but he was able to corral it. Burke posed triumphantly with the ball for photos and said he gave other fans a chance to touch it as well. After making the amazing catch he called his wife to tell her what he'd done. maybe she'll be joing his at the next game. 'I dropped my phone at Wendy's and said my husband caught the home run ball. Everyone there thought I was insane,' Michelle Burke recounted with joy. Big win: 'I'm just the lucky guy who caught it. Travis deserves all the credit for hitting the ball.

"BBC and ITV both dipped into the  transfer market to boost their chances of winning the World Cup TV battle this summer, with Thierry Henry, Clarence Seedorf and Fabio Cannavaro signing short-term deals to appear as part of their coverage. Gary Lineker, England’s top World Cup goalscorer and long-time BBC pundit, tweeted a picture of BBC's 'team' for their first live matches, Spain against Holland on Friday and England versus Italy on Saturday. 'Half decent, I'd say,' was Lineker's verdict - and he's not wrong. Henry, Rio Ferdinand and Alan Shearer joined Lineker for the selfie, and with Seedorf waiting in the wings for future games the BBC have the makings of quite a five-a-side team over in Brazil. VIDEO Scroll don to watch BBC pundits Lineker and Ferdinand . Team BBC: Thierry Henry, Rio Ferdinand, Gary Lineker and Alan Shearer in Brazil on Wednesday . All-star selfie (apart from the bloke at the back): (left-right) Youri Djorkaeff, Luis Figo, Fabio Cannavaro, Patrick Vieira and Christian Vieri posed for this picture by the former Italy captain and World Cup-winning defender . Hours after Lineker’s tweet, Cannavaro also posted a picture from South America. The former Ballon d’Or winner was joined by Youri Djorkaeff, Luis Figo and Patrick Vieira, the latter of whom will be joining him as part of ITV’s World Cup team. Which begs the question – who would win in a five-a-side game between the two channels? BBC . Thierry Henry – 123 caps, 51 goals . Clarence Seedorf – 87 caps, 21 goals . Rio Ferdinand – 81 caps, 3 goals . Gary Lineker – 80 caps, 48 goals . Alan Shearer – 63 caps, 30 goals . TOTAL – 434 caps, 153 goals . ITV . Fabio Cannavaro – 136 caps, 2 goals . Patrick Vieira – 107 caps, 6 goals . Glenn Hoddle – 53 caps, 8 goals . Ian Wright – 33 caps, 9 goals . Gus Poyet – 26 caps, 3 goals . TOTAL – 355 caps, 28 goals . Neither have an established goalkeeper in their TV coverage squad, so both will be playing 'spider' keepers, where any player on the pitch can swap and go between the sticks. There is no doubt ITV will miss Roy Keane in midfield – the tantalising prospect of him lining up alongside Vieira snatched away from viewers when the Irishman decided to pursue the assistant manager's job at Aston Villa. Adrian Chiles must be worried about where his side’s goals are going to come from too, with ITV’s team scoring just 28 goals between them during their international careers, a figure dwarfed by BBC’s tally of 153. Defensively, however, ITV definitely have the upper hand. Cannavaro and Vieira, World Cup winners with Italy and France respectively, would be formidable in a five-a-side set-up, while Glenn Hoddle and Gus Poyet would be comfortable keeping possession in midfield.

"Documents show that crime tsar Shaun Wright knew in advance about the scale of the child abuse . The crime tsar defying calls for his resignation over the Rotherham child grooming scandal came under fresh pressure to quit last night after The Mail on Sunday uncovered damning proof that he ignored a mass of evidence of abuse. Shaun Wright, the Police and Crime Commissioner for South Yorkshire, has claimed the scale of the crisis was a ‘huge surprise’ to him after a report revealed at least 1,400 girls in Rotherham were abused by gangs of predominantly Asian men. But a dossier of more than 20 files provides powerful evidence that in his former post as cabinet member for children’s services in Rotherham, Mr Wright must have been aware social services were dealing with hundreds of children at risk of sexual exploitation and abuse. Minutes from Rotherham’s Safeguarding Children Board (SCB) – which would have been passed to him – reveal that: . lThere was frustration among agencies about the difficulties in holding to account those adults who organised or took part in the sexual exploitation of children. lThere were not enough resources to cope with the level of need. Last night, David Greenwood, a solicitor representing 15 of the victims, said Mr Wright should resign immediately. ‘The figures were available to him and I fail to see how he could have been unaware of the scale,’ he said. A council source added: ‘These minutes would have passed across Wright’s desk without any question. Did he read them? If he didn’t, he should have done. And whether he did or not, he should hang his head in shame and resign.’ Mr Wright has quit the Labour Party but has refused demands to leave his £85,000-a-year PCC post. The dossier of quarterly minutes from the SCB – made up of education, health, police and social workers – charts the growth of grooming and predatory behaviour to near-epidemic proportions throughout the five years that Mr Wright was Rotherham’s cabinet member for children’s services, from 2005 until 2010. Although his attendance at the quarterly SCB meetings was not compulsory, it was part of the board’s responsibility to pass the minutes on to him – and part of his to read them. Sections of a dossier which shows that Shaun Wright was alerted to the scale of the scandal in Rotherham . Documents show between 2007 and 2010 alone, the number of sexually exploited children – mostly girls – coming to the notice of social services and youth workers each year increased more than tenfold from 45 to 483. Our evidence also shows that over five years the problem of sexual exploitation was frequently discussed, and that the rapidly growing scale of the problem was readily apparent. In the minutes and attached reports seen by The Mail on Sunday, the overwhelming magnitude of the problem is obvious as the numbers of young people in contact with either council staff or the specialist outreach youth workers of a group called Risky Business, grows out of control. Last night, Mr Wright failed to respond to messages. His spokeswoman said he was ‘unavailable’.","Some 1,400 young girls were abused by gangs of predominantly Asian men .

However, new documents show he knew of the problem in October 2005 ."
"As a three-star Michelin chef renowned for his whacky concoctions such as snail porridge, he wasn’t the obvious choice to create a picnic fit for the Queen. But that is exactly what Heston Blumenthal did. The world-renowned British chef conjured up a remarkable five-course menu for 12,000 lucky guests who secured free tickets for today’s Diamond Jubilee concert at Buckingham Palace. The classic hampers featured traditional British dishes such as coronation chicken and Eton mess with a Blumenthal twist – although, unfortunately, there wasn’t a puff of his trademark liquid nitrogen in sight. Lavish affair: A couple find a spot away from the crowds in the grounds of Buckingham Palace to enjoy their special five-course picnic . Guests began with a chilled country garden soup comprised of baby plum tomatoes and a mint-infused oil, followed by Lapsang Souchong tea-smoked Scottish salmon and Diamond Jubilee chicken. Heston was keen to include the chicken dish as it was originally devised to celebrate the Queen’s official crowning in 1953 and is, surprisingly, a particular favourite of the chef himself. Debby Smith, 43, from Manchester, gave a mixed reaction to Blumenthal's Diamond Jubilee chicken, an update of Coronation chicken which was created to mark the Queen's coronation in 1953. 'I tried the little chicken dish and made it into a sandwich. I'm not a lover of Coronation chicken but it's certainly edible.' ‘My family used to go for picnics in . Windsor Great park and I used to try and wolf it down before everyone . else. It’s just the ultimate curry,’ he said. His included a special secret blend of Indian spices with mayonnaise, shredded chicken, coriander and peppery nigella seeds. It was followed by a Sandringham Strawberry Crumble Crunch with fruit from the Queen’s own estate, meringue, cream and an oat-crumble topping as well as tiny chocolate cakes featuring gold crowns and topped with popping candy, lemon and caraway madeira cake and a cheeseboard. There was also vegetarian, dairy and gluten free options. Apparently the Queen tried each and every dish – which took six months to create with the help of royal head chef Mark Flanagan- and gave her seal of approval. Mr Blumenthal told the Mail: ‘Despite my name I am British through and through and very proud of it. Who would have thought when I was chopping onions a few years ago that I would now be cooking for the Queen.’ The hampers were provided by the Queen’s warrant holder, supermarket Waitrose. Chief executive officer Mark Price said: ‘Her Majesty has personally tasted every dish and has been involved in creating everything that goes into the hamper. Her attention to detail is legendary and we are very proud to be involved in creating them as our Jubilee gift to her.’ Heston's hamper: Coronation chicken, Heston style, crunch crudites, lemon and cardamon madeira cake, a cheeseboard featuring West Country farmhouse cheddar and Red Leicester crunch, and the Prince of Wales' Duchy Originals oat cakes .

"Pressure: George Osborne is being urged to cut fuel duty in his budget this month - but the signs are he will not . Petrol prices have hit an all-time high today as the cost of unleaded continues the march towards the £100 fill-up. Prices at the pump have reached 137.44p, beating the previous record 137.43p - set in May last year - by 0.01p. Diesel is up to 144.67p - another new record, said the AA. Last night the AA warned that this figure could rise further, and today's figure means the average family have seen the cost of filling up their car soar by £18 to more than £96 over the past two years. A diesel fill-up has already exceeded the £100 mark. The news increased pressure on Chancellor George Osborne to cut fuel duty again for the UK’s 33million motorists – but all the signals from the Treasury are that he will not. AA president Edmund King said: 'This new record for petrol and diesel just confirms what every family and business knows - fuel prices are hurting them badly and there seems no stopping them. 'We have asked the Chancellor to do what he can to protect the UK economy from fuel market volatility and record high prices which are stemming growth.' Mr King went on: 'There is no more give in family and business budgets despite them cutting back on fuel purchase and other spending so they can get to work and go about their business. 'Britain cannot get back on its feet if fuel prices hold drivers and business to ransom every time market sentiment takes hold.' It comes days after the Daily Mail revealed that the UK is the fuel tax capital of Europe. British motorists are shouldering the heaviest tax burden in the EU at the pumps, paying 60p in every pound in duty and VAT. The AA said pump prices were being pushed up by soaring oil and wholesale prices which, in turn, were driven by instability in the Middle East and ‘greedy speculators’. It expects up to 3p more to be added by the summer, taking average prices to 140.43p a litre. AA spokesman Luke Bosdet said: ‘A return to last year’s record petrol prices will confirm to drivers that 2012 is a carbon copy of 2011 – oil price rises stoked by concerns about the Middle East, boosted by stock market speculation. ‘UK motorists and businesses couldn’t afford these costs last year and they still can’t. Economic recovery will suffer, fuel demand and tax receipts will fall and firms will go bust. It feels like Groundhog Day, but with nothing to laugh about and a sense that the ordeal is getting worse with no way to prevent it.’ Soaring: The average petrol price is just a fraction under the record of 137.43p - while diesel has already broken through the record 143.04p per litre barrier set last year . Unleaded prices are just 0.09p a litre short of the record set in May 2011, following a 1.25p rise in the past week alone. Mr Bosdet added: ‘Speculators are driving up the prices at the pumps against a background of uncertainty in the Middle East. The market is being aggressively stoked up. There’s no transparency over pricing – it’s getting out of control.’ Two years ago, the average price of petrol was 112.74p per litre. Last night it was 137.34p, an increase of 24.6p per litre. Over that two-year period, the cost of filling up a Ford Mondeo with a 70-litre tank has soared from £78.92 to £96.14, well on the way to the average £100 fill-up, with some drivers of petrol cars at the most expensive filling stations already paying it. Pump misery: The cost of filling a 70-litre Ford Mondeo tank has now hit £96 . Drivers of diesel Mondeos are already enduring the ‘ton-up’ fill-up. On February 17 diesel broke through the record 143.04p per litre barrier also set in May last year and has been climbing to new highs ever since. Yesterday it was a record 144.6p per litre. The cost of filling up a diesel Mondeo has risen from £79.65 two years ago to £101.22 today. Mr Bosdet said: ‘The AA has written to the Chancellor calling for an investigation of the oil, refining, fuel product and retail markets to ensure UK families and business are protected from over-inflated prices and supply difficulties. ‘It has also called for an end to annual fuel duty hikes while the economy falters. This includes cancelling the planned rise in August.’ A Treasury spokesman said: ‘At the Autumn Statement, the Government took more action to help households with motoring costs by freezing fuel duty until August and scrapping a second planned rise altogether. ‘This came after our decision to cut fuel duty at Budget 2011, abolish the fuel duty escalator and replace it with a fair fuel stabiliser. ‘Petrol and diesel will be an average of 10p per litre cheaper than if we had proceeded with the escalator introduced in 2009.’ A 5p-a-litre discount on petrol and diesel prices comes into force this week on some remote Scottish islands and the Isles of Scilly. But local MPs have complained that prices have been jacked up in advance of the discount, so that motorists are no better off. Today's unwanted records follow a survey by the Countryside Alliance which showed that the price of diesel in rural filling stations is, on average, 4p more than in urban areas. The alliance said cars are becoming an 'unaffordable necessity' for many living in rural communities. The costliest diesel - at 146.9p a litre - was in Purbeck in Dorset and Ryedale in North Yorkshire. In contrast, diesel in Birmingham and in Dartford in south east London was 'only' 139.7p a litre. Overall, the alliance found that diesel in rural areas averaged 144p a litre, while in urban areas the average was 140p. Countryside Alliance executive chairman Barney White-Spunner said: 'Not only do people living in rural areas have to drive further to go to work, further to access essential services like schools, doctors and the supermarket, but they have to pay a lot more for their diesel to do so. 'The cost of fuel is a major concern for everyone who lives in the countryside, and cars are fast becoming an unaffordable necessity for many rural families. 'We urge the Chancellor to help the rural economy get back on its feet and to cut fuel duty in his forthcoming Budget.' The alliance survey follows findings earlier this week that UK motorists pay more in fuel tax than any other drivers in Europe. And a report by the Centre for Economics and Business Research has said that cutting fuel duty would create thousands of jobs and could be done at no loss to the Treasury. Campaign group FairFuelUK met Treasury Minister Chloe Smith this week, armed with the initial findings of the CEBR report. Ms Smith was expected to receive the full report today.","Diesel fill-up is already more than £100 per tank .

Managers:  Kwasi Appiah (Ghana) and Jurgen Klinsmann (USA)Key clash: John Boye v Jozy Altidore . Centre back Boye has been the subject of speculation linked him to Barcelona and has the perfect opportunity to show that he can mix it up against the bulky Altidore. The Sunderland striker struggled for form this season but two goals in a pre-World Cup friendly show he will still pose a danger upfront, particularly against defenders who give him any room to breathe.One to watch: Christian Atsu (Ghana) Despite only making his international debut two years ago, Atsu has quickly built up 21 caps for his country and will want to use the world stage to impress Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho. He has been dubbed the ‘African Messi’ by Ghanaians and will look to show off his pace on the counter.Head-to-head record: Played 1 Ghana wins 1 . Captain America: Clint Dempsey will lead the USA . Team News: . Ghana will be looking to complete a hat-trick of World Cup wins over the United States when the sides meet in Group G on Monday. The teams have been paired in the last three tournaments, with the Black Stars winning 2-1 in Germany and South Africa. But the USA come into the 2014 edition with greater confidence having reached number 13 in the FIFA rankings and topped CONCACAF's qualifying sector with ease. Victory this time would not only erase some of that past pain but also provide a solid base for Jurgen Klinsmann's side as they attempt to pip group favourites Germany and Portugal to a place in the last 16. Ghana's John Mensa, who played in the 2010 win over Monday's opponents as a late call-up, acknowledges the previous games between the two sides will add an extra edge to their meeting in Natal. USA coach Klinsmann has courted debate with his decision to omit the country's record goalscorer Landon Donovan from the squad. Donovan is a fans' favourite and has been hired to commentate on his former's team-mates on US television, providing a potentially distracting sub-plot. Ready for battle: Ghana's John Boye will try and stop Jozy Altidore of the USA . Ghana have met USA in each of their two previous participations in World Cups, winning 2-1 on both occasions (2006 group, 2010 second round). Indeed USA were knocked out of the 2010 World Cup by Ghana; the last team to face the same opponent in consecutive World Cup games was Scotland, who were eliminated by Brazil in 1990 before facing them in their 1998 opener (they didn’t qualify in 1994). This will also happen a few days before this match when the Netherlands face Spain. Four of Ghana’s previous nine World Cup goals have come against USA. The USA have only kept two clean sheets in their last 23 games at the World Cup. Ghana scored more goals than any other team in the 2014 African World Cup qualifiers (25). No player scored more goals than Ghana’s Asamoah Gyan in the 2014 African World Cup qualifiers (6). The former Sunderland man has also scored four and assisted two of Ghana’s nine World Cup goals, and netted the winner against USA in 2010. USA boss Jürgen Klinsmann played 17 games and scored 11 goals at the World Cup with Germany. This is his second World Cup as head-coach having led his home nation to third place in 2006. Landon Donovan has been left out of the USA Squad for the 2014 World Cup. He is USA’s top scorer at World Cups with five goals; he has scored three of their last four at the competition.","Ghana face the USA for the third World Cup in a row .

"'Embarrassment', 'occasionally' and 'necessary' have been named among the words Brits have most difficulty spelling. Researchers, who carried out a study among 2,000 adults, found more than half frequently have issues spelling commonly-used words. Others which we often struggle with are 'accommodate', 'questionnaire' and 'rhythm'. 'Conscience' causes many a Brit a headache, and the words 'occurrence', 'restaurant' and 'guarantee' are also tricky to master. Scroll down for video . Researchers, who carried out a study among 2,000 adults, found more than half frequently have issues spelling commonly-used words, such as 'embarrassment', 'occasionally' and 'necessary'. File picture . Also on the top 50 everyday words Brits struggle with were the words 'definite', 'separate' and 'weird'. While 'appearance', 'queue' and 'receive' cause many a person to scratch their head. The results of the study emphasised the average person's reliance on spelling assistance - 40 per cent confessed they completely rely on autocorrect technology to monitor their spelling in day-to-day communication. Over a fifth would panic if they were forced to abandon the use of autocorrect or spell-checking technology and rely on their own knowledge. But spelling mistakes still prove common and costly- just under a quarter of people have been embarrassed by a spelling mistake they made at work. Perils of technology: A total of 40 per cent of Britons put their declining spelling down to the fact that they rarely write things out by hand anymore. File picture . While spelling ability is often noticed by others - 48 per cent of people admit they can't help but judge people if their spelling is bad. A resounding nine in ten people think it's still absolutely crucial for a child to learn to spell properly. Over a fifth of those polled said they haven't paid attention to spelling since they were at school - in fact Brits were most likely to just Google a word to find the correct spelling if they needed it.

"Bret Easton Ellis has branded Millennials narcissistic, over-sensitive and sheltered in a damning 2,000-word analysis of 'Generation Wuss'. The writer who notably penned American Psycho sparked a social media outburst when he coined the phrase Generation Wuss to refer to those born after 1989. Now he has written an essay to defend his description, adding that he feels sorry for young people today. Damning: Bret Easton Ellis, 50, has written a 2,000-word analysis of 'over-sensitive' young people today . In the Vanity Fair article, he writes: 'When Millennials are criticized...they seem to collapse into a shame spiral and the person criticizing them is automatically labeled a hater, a contrarian, a troll.' He adds: 'My huge generalities touch on their over-sensitivity, their insistence that they are right despite the overwhelming proof that suggests they are not.' The 50-year-old also lays into news site BuzzFeed, which announced it will no longer publish any negative reviews. 'If this keeps spreading,' Easton Ellis writes, 'then what’s going to happen to culture?' Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr  are also condemned as factors that have fuelled the generation's sensitivity. 'If there doesn’t seem to be an economic way of elevating yourself,' he writes, 'then the currency of popularity is just the norm now and so this is why you want to have thousands and thousands of people liking you on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Tumbler (sic) —and you try desperately to be liked. 'The only way to elevate yourself in society is through your brand, your profile, your social media presence.' But Easton Ellis insists he is in fact sympathetic to members of Generation Wuss growing up in the wake of 9/11, two brutal wars, and an economic crisis - in a 'demeaning sexual atmosphere that places a relentless emphasis on good looks (Tinder being the most prevalent example)'. Generation Wuss: He says twenty-somethings like those depicted in HBO show Girls cannot take criticism . He adds that he has lived with a Millennial and understands that many of the struggles they are 'over-sensitive' about are very real - and the HBO series Girls strikes the balance between critique and sympathy. But he says he finds it difficult to maintain sympathy for twenty-somethings 'because Millennials can’t deal with that kind of cold-eye reality'. He added: 'This is why Generation Wuss only asks right now: please, please, please, only give positive feedback please.' The author lays the blame on the generation's parents who grew up in a cynical age - yet when it came to building their own families they tried to shroud their children from the harsh realities of life. He warns young people: 'People won’t like you, that person may not love you back, kids are really cruel, work sucks, it’s hard to be good at something, life is made up of failure and disappointment, you’re not talented, people suffer, people grow old, people die.' His words come after three years of tweeting, in which the author and screenplay-writer regularly mocked young people for being too sensitive. One tweet read: 'Typical Generation Wuss comment: ""You know, Twitter has really ruined you for me."" It's TWITTER. Get a f****** life'. And after a former fan tweeted, 'I just can't follow Bret Easton Ellis anymore. He's so pretentious that I hate myself for following him', he responded: 'Hey GENERATION WUSS: Grow a dick.'","American Psycho author brands those born after 1989 Generation Wuss .

"Ralf-Werner Dehmer, 50, claimed he tripped over his dog and severed the digits on a circular saw. However insurers said what happened was no accident . A German insurance agent who cut off his own finger and thumb to claim £1.2million in compensation has been found guilty of fraud after judges heard experts say what happened to him was no accident. A court in Norderstedt, near Hamburg, gave Ralf-Werner Dehmer, 50, a 22-month suspended sentence when he was found guilty of trying to defraud his insurers. Judges heard how Dehmer took out three seperate insurance policies - each one with a special clause covering hand and finger wounds - shortly before the 'accident' in February 2010. He was rushed to hospital from his home that month with the thumb and forefinger of his left hand missing. 'I tripped over my two dogs and fell into a circular saw,' he said. But police and insurance company officials smelled a rat. One report commissioned by an insurance fraud specialist said it was 'particularly astonishing' that the rest of his hand wasn't mangled. 'If I take out three insurance policies eight weeks before such a serious accident for such an irrational sum, something isn't right,' the prosecutor said. 'There's a lot of evidence against the accused. There was too little blood on the saw. An automatic car was ready to go. That number of coincidences can't be real.' The missing digits from his hand were not found in a police search of his basement workshop - his wife said she 'found' them in the snow outside a week later.

"New York Yankees superstar Alex Rodriguez admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs in an interview with federal agents investigating a Florida anti-aging clinic at the center of baseball's doping scandal, the Miami Herald reported on Wednesday. Rodriguez, 39, publicly has denied the use of banned substances from the Miami-area Biogenesis clinic, even as he concluded last week a one-year suspension by Major League Baseball for violating the league's doping program. But speaking to federal authorities in January, Rodriguez admitted to buying and using hormone-filled syringes and creams from the clinic, the Herald reported, citing a 15-page summary of the meeting. Scroll down for video . Career blow: New York Yankees superstar Alex Rodriguez admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs in an interview with federal agents, the Miami Herald reported on Wednesday . The Herald gained access to the documents as prosecutors pursue criminal charges against the clinic's owner and six others tied to one of sport's biggest doping scandals, including Rodriguez's cousin, Yuri Sucart. In the meeting, Rodriguez admitted to paying for and using banned substances, the Herald reported. Rodriguez injected human growth hormone into his stomach, according to the report reviewed by the newspaper, and described to federal authorities how the owner of the now-defunct clinic gave him tips on evading Major League Baseball's doping tests. Ron Berkowitz, Rodriguez's agent, could not immediately be reached for comment. MLB had no comment on the article.

A spokeswoman for the Miami field office of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration said she did not know what report the Herald cited, and declined further comment in the case. Federal prosecutors also declined to comment. Anthony Bosch, who owned the clinic where prosecutors allege professional athletes paid as much as $12,000 per month for testosterone-filled syringes and creams, pled guilty last month to a felony charge of conspiracy to distribute testosterone. Rodriguez who was recently reinstated to the Yankees roster, was only 18 years old when he made his major league debut with the Seattle Mariners in 1994. He established himself as one of baseball's top sluggers, driving in more than 100 runs in 14 seasons and hitting more than 30 home runs 14 times.

Unbeknownst to him, his father had two more children 16 years later in Wisconsin. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Ecstatic: John Pilotte, 47, and Susie Wilson, 31, ran at each other when they finally met for the first time . Embrace: Susie flew from Green Bay to New Orleans to meet John, who her father gave up for adoption . Discovery: They made contact after Susie found John on Facebook and called him on Thanksgiving 2011 . But it wasn't until Thanksgiving 2011 that he discovered his secret siblings when he received a phone call from Susie Wilson - who had found him on Facebook. 'I'm your sister,' she told him. John balked: 'I just said ""excuse me? I think you've got the wrong number!""' They talked for an hour, and it sparked an incredibly close friendship.

"It sounds like something out of Rudyard Kipling's Just So Stories - how the hippo got 20 terrapins on its back. But this was a real-life sight for holidaymakers in South Africa's Kruger National Park, who fell about laughing when they saw a fully-grown hippopotamus ferrying more than a dozen companions across a waterhole. Hippos have been known to attack wildebeest, lions and even crocodiles, but this benign creature appeared to have a soft spot for terrapins and let a whole family sunbathe on its back. Elaine de Klerk, 42, who captured the sight on camera, said: 'We couldn't stop laughing at him. 'I don't know why he allowed so many to climb aboard, but we think that they were using him as a rock to sunbathe. We've seen this before, but with only one or two terrapins - we couldn't believe what we were looking at.' Mrs de Klerk, who lives with her husband near the city of Durban, has now nicknamed the animal a 'pond taxi'. Hitching a lift: These terrapins jumped aboard a fully-grown hippopotamus in South Africa's Kruger Park, and the creature floated serenely without shaking them off .","Apparently gentle giant was lazing around in a waterhole in the Kruger National Park, South Africa .

"Former culture secretary Maria Miller has worked to stamp out revenge porn . Posting 'revenge pornography' online could lead to a jail term of up to 14 years, under tough new guidelines published today. The Crown Prosecution Service said uploading explicit images to spite an ex could break sex offence laws or even child protection legislation. Putting intimate photographs or videos of an under 18 online can carry a 10 year maximum sentence in ‘very serious cases’. But if intimate images are sent in a bid to force someone into sexual activity the sender could be hit with up to 14 years behind bars, the CPS said. Up to now many cases were considered under 'obscene publications laws' - which are harder to prove because they need to pass a high 'public interest threshold' and carry softer sentences. But prosecutors have moved to toughen up sentences against the 'nasty and invasive crime' amid growing concern over people humiliating their ex partners on Facebook and other internet sites out of spite. It came as figures revealed nine out 10 revenge porn victims  see their ex-partner escape punishment. Just six people have been cautioned or charged for uploading explicit pictures of their ex – despite 149 victims asking the police for help. The Crown Prosecution Service said anyone considering leaking explicit images of their ex partner should know they would be hauled before the courts. But the former Culture Secretary Maria Miller said the crackdown did not go far enough. Mrs Miller said a new law was needed to ban explicit photos and videos being posted on the internet out of spite - not just 'new guidance' to tackle the problem. She attacked the ‘existing mishmash of legislation’ which let men ridicule their former girlfriends online. Mrs Miller said the web could no longer be treated as the ‘wild west’ where anything goes. She said: ‘In the last two years numerous states in the US have been forced to pass legislation, to protect private citizens from the growing problem of “revenge pornography” – where private and intimate pictures taken as part of a relationship end up online after that relationship ends, with devastating results. ‘New figures just released by police forces in England show the number of people affected by “revenge pornography” in the UK is far greater than previously thought and that the majority of these victims are not protected under the law.’ She said a new law specifically banned ‘posting sexual images online, without the consent of the person depicted’. Mrs Miller said: ‘I would like the offence of posting this material to sit alongside voyeurism in the 2003 Sexual Offences Act to stop this emerging crime in its tracks.’ The Crown Prosecution Service today outlined new guidance designed to make it easier to punish ‘revenge pornography’ amid growing public concern over the issue. A spokesperson for the CPS said: ‘No one should have to suffer the hurt and humiliation of “revenge pornography” – a nasty and invasive crime that appears, anecdotally at least, to have increased as social media use has gone up. ‘The Crown Prosecution Service prosecutes these cases using a range of current laws, and we have now clarified our legal guidance to set out clearly how these cases should be brought to court. ‘Due to the very personal nature of “revenge pornography” prosecutors are being asked specifically to consider the impact on the victims involved. ‘The new guidance also makes clear that the context of each case needs to be considered alongside current guidelines to ensure that the most appropriate legislation is used when prosecuting.' Scroll down for video . Hannah Davison, 21, (right) was mortified when Christopher Todd (left) sent an intimate photo of her to her mother’s phone after their break-up . The CPS said 'those intent on attacking former partners in this way' needed to see they would be hauled before the courts for their online abuse. ‘Revenge pornography’ is typically sexually explicit media that is publically shared online without the consent of the pictured individual and is usually uploaded by ex-partners. ‘The images are often accompanied by personal information including the pictured individual’s full name, links to social media profiles and address, and are shared with the intent to cause distress or harm to the individual.’","Just 6 people have been punished for uploading explicit pictures of their ex .

"An ostrich-sized bird that is capable of disembowelling a human with its claws has been seen roaming around the English countryside. The South American rhea, which stands six feet tall and can run at 40mph, has been on the run for two years foiling all attempts to catch it. The giant flightless bird, which has six-inch claws and could kill with a single blow, was photographed by Steve Lynes near the RAF Odiham base in Hampshire. The flightless birds, also known as 'Nandu', can grow up to six feet tall and weigh up to four stone . Ron has been on the run for two years defeating all efforts by police, the RSPCA and landowners to catch it . The Rhea, nicknamed Ron, has survived two winters in the wild after escaping from captivity, although it is unclear where from. It has startled motorists by dashing in and out of traffic on a stretch of road between Long Sutton and Odiham, in Hampshire. In the wild, they live in the pampas regions where it is hot in summer and very cold in winter, which means they are ideally suited to the changeable British climate. The flightless birds, also known as 'Nandu' can grow up to six feet tall and weigh up to four stone. A statement from Hampshire police countrywatch said: 'Generally the bird keeps itself to itself and clearly appears to be coping with living in the wild. 'The RSPCA states that there are no concerns for its welfare.' A spokesman for the RSPCA told MailOnline: 'Rheas are large birds and have the potential to be dangerous as they are strong, fast and have sharp claws. 'We believe this one escaped from a local resident who owns a smallholding. 'Our advice to the general public is keep well away and call us or the police if they see the bird. 'We would not recommend that anyone attempts to restrain or catch a rhea themselves, as these birds are able to kick in any direction and may kick out if they feel threatened. If anyone does spot the rhea they should contact us.' In May, a rhea was shot by a gamekeeper after roaming around a golf course for more than a month after its escape from a smallholding near Royston, in Hertfordshire. It was shot because it was feared dangerous, but its owner Jo Clarke, said there was no need to kill it. Ms Clarke has kept rheas for many years – among her horses, sheep, geese, ducks and cats – in order to keep down the weeds on her 11 acres. The Common Rhea, also known as Rhea Americana or 'Nandu' is native to South American, especially Bolivia, and is often called the South American ostrich. In the wild, they live in the pampas regions where it is hot in summer and very cold in winter, which means they are ideally suited to the changeable British climate. They can grow up to six feet tall and weigh up to four stone, with the males being larger than the females. They are omnivores but mainly eat insects, shoots, leaves and grasses. Rheas have six-inch claws on their feet and large wings that are used in courtship, mating and aggressive displays. Male birds can bite or knock out a person with one blow from their claws, while female rheas are unlikely to be aggressive. They have a distinctive cry, which sounds more like a big cat's roar than a bird call. In South America, rheas, which can live for up to 40 years are farmed for their meat which is low in cholesterol, while in the UK they are increasingly popular as pets. Rheas are polygamous. Males incubate up to 60 eggs - laid by as many as 12 mates - in a single nest.","Common Rhea, native to South America, spotted in the English countryside .

"Ousted: Juan McFarland has been removed from the Alabama Baptist church he has led for 23 years . A pastor has revealed in a series of sermons that he has used drugs, has AIDS and knowingly had sex with parishioners in church grounds while suffering from the disease, according to reports. Following his series of confessions, Juan Demetrius McFarland has been removed from Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama as his stunned congregation tries to come to terms with his revelations. McFarland, who has led the church for 23 years, first revealed to worshipers in mid-September that he had contracted HIV in 2003 and was diagnosed with AIDS in 2008. At first, the congregation offered their sympathy and support. 'The church was very accepting of Reverend McFarland and was willing to help him in any way possible,' an unidentified church member told WSFA 12 News. But after he returned to the pulpit, he revealed that he had used drugs - including cocaine - while pastor and used church funds to pay for business trips that he then didn't take, AL.com reported. And there was more. 'He concealed from the church that he had knowingly engaged in adultery in the church building with female members of Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church while knowingly having AIDS,' said church deacon Nathan Williams Jr. Shocking: McFarland, pictured delivering a sermon at the church earlier this year, revealed that he had taken cocaine while pastor, misused church funds for trips he didn't take and had sex with churchgoers . Whether or not he told all of his sexual partners that he had HIV or AIDS is yet to be determined, but one church-goer said she would be undergoing tests to see if she had the disease, WSFA reported. 'My heart goes out to her because she's been a wonderful church member, and then for something like this to happen,' the church member said. 'The fact that he didn't tell them at all. That's a crime in itself.' Charges have not been filed against McFarland, 47, although some church members are calling for his prosecution. A former Shiloh deacon who heard his sermons told AL.com that McFarland is not taking medicine to treat his illness. After his most recent sermons, deacons voted on October 5 to remove him as pastor. On Sunday, Montgomery police were called after church members started fighting with each other but no one was removed. Williams said he thinks police were called on people who had voted the pastor out. Scene: After being removed from the church in Montgomery, Alabama (pictured), McFarland reportedly changed the locks and now other church leaders are seeking legal counsel . The spat has since continued, with McFarland and some newly appointed staff changing the locks on the church on Monday morning, AL.com reported. Williams told WSFA that leaders have obtained legal counsel to save the church. 'Our moves are going to come directly from counsel. We want peace and we want to do things right, legally,' Williams said. 'We are not looking to hurt him. We are looking to get the church back.' McFarland is also the Moderator with the Alabama Middle District Baptist Association, which includes 34 churches. Leaders indicated there are not yet any plans to remove him from this position.","Juan McFarland has been removed from Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama after deacons voted unanimously to oust him .

"A midwife with more than 20 years' experience may be able to return to her position despite being sacked for telling a woman in labour that she would 'get the baby out with a knife and fork'. Marion Owens, a senior nurse at Liverpool Women's Hospital, was dismissed after the foul-mouthed rant in which she also told the patient: 'I've been a midwife for 20 f****** years and no f***** is telling me how to f****** care for a f****** woman in labour'. Mrs Owens, who had worked at the hospital since 1993, admitted charges brought by the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) and agreed to be subjected to certain sanctions for three years. Marion Owens, a nurse at Liverpool Women's Hospital (pictured), was dismissed after the foul-mouthed rant . However, an NMC panel this week rejected the provisional agreement and ruled that Mrs Owens should face a fresh hearing because the case 'although serious, was at the lower end of the scale of misconduct'. It means that while she initially faced working under sanctions for three years due to her behaviour, she may be able to return to midwifery work as normal if given permission to do so by the panel. The tribunal heard that Mrs Owens had returned to work at the hospital following an absence when she launched the tirade on June 14, 2012. The CPD agreement told how the patient recounted Mrs Owens 'slurring her speech and behaving erratically'. The patient was not named in evidence of the case, but was instead referred to Patient A. The judgement read: 'Patient A refers to the registrant recounting a previous patient who had a hypnotist as their birth partner. 'She refers to the registrant then becoming animated and saying to her and her birth partner that she ""had been a midwife for 20 f****** years and no f***** is telling me how to f****** care for a f****** woman in labour"". 'The patient refers to her shock that a health professional would use this language in a clinical area. 'She also recounts feelings of concern when the registrant said to her ""I will get your baby out with a knife and fork"". The matter will now be listed for a fresh hearing with the panel from the Nursing and Midwifery Council (above) Mrs Owens, who also admitted failing to ensure that patients wore name bands, keeping timely notes, and using a drug to induce a patient before it had been prescribed, admitted 'her actions fell seriously short of what would be expected of a registered midwife' and that the language had been 'entirely inappropriate'. The NMC said there was no evidence to suggest any harm was caused to any of the patients in her care on June 14, 2012 and that Mrs Owens had displayed remorse and insight into her behaviour. Panel chair John Weedon said: '[The panel] was satisfied that a member of the public in full knowledge of the circumstances of the case, and being aware of the insight and remediation demonstrated, would not consider a finding of impairment necessary to uphold the reputation of the profession and maintain proper standards. 'In all the circumstances, the panel was unable to endorse the CPD agreement in relation to the finding of impairment.' Since May, 2013, Mrs Owens has worked as a nurse at Liverpool's Church View Care Home. The panel said it did not consider there was a 'real risk' of her behaviour being repeated. Mrs Owens, who had worked at the hospital for more than 20 years prior to the tirade of abuse, admitted charges brought by the Nursing and Midwifery Council and now faces a disciplinary hearing over her conduct . The matter will now be listed for a fresh hearing at a future date and if cleared, Mrs Owens may be able to return to her position as midwife. A spokesman for Liverpool Women's NHS Foundation Trust said: 'Following a comprehensive management investigation, the Trust can confirm that, whilst no direct patient harm was found to have been caused, the midwife in question was deemed to have displayed serious and significant failings in her professional duty of care. 'This investigation resulted in her dismissal from Liverpool Women's in December 2012 and the Trust also referred its findings to the midwife's professional body, the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC). 'Liverpool Women's NHS Foundation Trust is dedicated to providing safe, effective and compassionate care to all our women, their babies and their families. 'Any incidents that may impact on our ability to deliver those high standards are dealt with in a prompt and appropriate manner.'","Nurse Marion Owens had worked at Liverpool Women's Hospital for 20 years .

"A police officer shot and blinded in one eye during an arrest has posted a moving video diary of his recovery  - describing the attack as “one of those things.” Police sergeant Jon King, 48, was blasted twice in the face at close range after he and his colleagues were called to help paramedics detain a man under the Mental Health Act. The officer, who has 26 years’ service with the force, now faces the possibility of his career being over after being blinded in his right eye. Hero: Police sergeant Jon King, 48, started the video blog to chronicle his road to recovery after being shot during an arrest . The Staffordshire Police officer pictured with his wife, Lisa, and daughter, Frances . Speaking for the first time since the attack, he said: “I thought at first I was dead and the man had blown half my head off. “I was too scared to touch my face in case it wasn’t there. “It was dark but he was about 6ft away from me when he shot me. It knocked me straight off my feet. “When I got up and went past him he shot me again in the other eye but thankfully it just grazed it. He was arrested and I was taken to hospital. “When I was told I’d lost my right eye and might lose the sight in my left I thought immediately of David Rathband who was blinded by Raul Moat a couple of years ago. “I remember saying to a nurse ‘if I’m blind in both eyes I’m going to jump out the window’ and the way I felt at that moment I was serious. “Luckily, I can see out my left eye and, although my career might be over, I feel incredibly lucky that it wasn’t a lot worse.” The officer, who has racked up four commendations, including two bravery awards over his career, has started a video blog chronicling his recovery. Just hours after he uploaded it to YouTube on Thursday night it attracted a staggering 1,500 hits from people across the globe. On the video, which he filmed at his home in Cannock, Staffs., he said: “Hi everyone this is part one of my video adventure really. “I am a police officer who was shot two weeks ago in this eye (points to right eye) with a gas powered handgun. “Shot a little hard rubber bullet which went straight into my eye which basically smashed my eyeball. “I’ve had surgery on it but I’m completely blind in it.

Police sergeant Jon King was shot twice in the face during an arrest in Rugeley, Staffordshire . “This eye is OK and the bleed has gone. I think I’m going to have a prosthetic eye and what I will want to do is just post some videos up as we go along. “I’ve got an appointment in two weeks with a plastics team and then they are going to see what they can do for me. “So in a couple of weeks I’ll come back on and give you an update. “I’m not really going to go into the shooting side of it, that will be dealt with at court. “It’s just one of those things. “I’ve got 26 years’ service and those sort of things just happen. “So I will get back and put another one on and hopefully we’ll see some progress with this thing (points to right eye) Hero: Police sergeant Jon King, 48, started the video to chronicle his recovery after he was shot twice in the face during an arrest . “Thanks for watching.” A 34-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of “disengaging an air weapon” during the disturbance in Tyler Close, Rugeley, Staffordshire., at 7.30pm on October 19. Sgt King was rushed to the trauma unit at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham after the attack where surgeons battled to save his sight. Medics were unable to save his right eye and warned him he might lost the sight in his left after the second bullet grazed the back of it. The father-of-four, who is married to Lisa, 43, a detective constable for Staffordshire CID, added: “I absolutely love my job but I always knew something like this would happen one day. “If you put yourself in the frontline for 26 years, you will get hurt at some point. The fact my career, certainly in the frontline, is almost certainly over is a massive blow. “I just hope by putting my video blogs online I will be able to look back in the future and see how far I’ve come.” Shortly after the attack, Chief Inspector Stephen Morrey, of Staffordshire Police, condemned the shooting, saying Sgt King was injured “doing his duty.”","Police sergeant Jon King, 48, was shot twice in the face at close range .

"New York City developers have begun working to turn a desolate railroad storage yard in Manhattan into a upscale new neighborhood filled with office skyscrapers, modern apartment towers and a slew of restaurants, bars and entertainment venues. Developers, realtors and local officials on Tuesday held a groundbreaking ceremony for Hudson Yards’ first office tower -- a 48-story building scheduled to be finished by 2015. The $15 billion, 26-acre project on the far west side of Midtown Manhattan will eventually include an arts building and a public square, developers say. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which owns the property, is leasing the land to developers for $1 billion. Scroll down for video . Artist rendering: The Hudson Yards redevelopment project as it will be seen from those looking northeast on the Hudson River . Thankful proponent: New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, center, at the groundbreaking ceremony for the long anticipated and controversial Hudson Yards project . ‘This is the future of New York,’ said Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a big proponent of the Hudson Yards project. The city rezoned 60 blocks to accommodate the project, approved $106 million in property tax exemptions and issued $3 billion in bonds to pay for an extension of the 7 train subway that now goes to Times Square. The completion of Hudson Yards will take about a dozen years, developers and officials say. The project entails the construction of an $800 million platform to cover the existing railroad tracks. The new office tower in the works will not require that platform. For several years the Bloomberg administration has made efforts to revitalize the area, which was the focal point of an unsuccessful bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics. Developer Stephen Ross, chairman of the privately-owned real estate giant Related Companies, compared the Hudson Yards project to the creation of the Empire State Building, Rockefeller Center, Lincoln Center and other iconic New York structures. Related has tentative deals in place . for two new tenants to occupy the first tower, making the Kohn Pedersen . Fox-designed skyscraper more than 80 per cent committed to occupants, . Ross said as construction began. He declined to name the new tenants.

Artist rendering: This undated  rendering shows Hudson Yards as it will be seen looking west from Midtown Manhattan . Lots of land: The desolate railroad storage yard where construction is underway is the largest undeveloped property in Manhattan . U.S. luxury handbag producer Coach had previously agreed to relocate its headquarters to the new building, which will reach 47 stories and include 1.7 million square feet (158,000 square meters) of space, Bloomberg News reports. Related is also planning to build its own 13.3 million-square-foot complex in Hudson Yards. New York City's commercial real estate market had been severely impacted by the great recession, and some projects, including towers planned at the World Trade Center site, have struggled to find tenants. Mayor Bloomberg said that Tuesday’s groundbreaking shows that ‘we are moving forward’ ‘even in this challenging economy.’ The project will create an estimated 23,000 construction jobs and space for more than 40,000 people to live or work, the mayor said. But as with most big development projects, Hudson Yards also has its share of opponents and skeptics. Kathleen Treat, who chairs the Hell’s Kitchen Neighborhood Association, recently called the project 'Hong Kong on the Hudson,' a reference to the densely populated city in Asia with people living in clustered high-rises. Others, including Columbia Business School real estate professor Lynne Sagalyn, have questioned whether there will be enough tenants to make the project viable in the long run. The city had previously planned to build a new stadium for the New York Jets in the same location, but the proposal caused ongoing disagreement among residents, businesspeople and politicians, and the 'West side Stadium' fell short of state approval.

"Jack Cottle, 22, admitted driving a VW Polo onto the Brands Hatch track in Kent . A prankster faces jail after admitting driving a Volkswagen Polo at high-speed on to the Brands Hatch circuit during a race. Jack Cottle, 22, hit speeds of up to 100mph with two passengers on board after gatecrashing an endurance race at the famous track in Kent on June 14. Maidstone Crown Court heard he performed the stunt after being dared by friends in a 'foolish prank', putting the lives of racers in danger. Cottle, from Durgates in Wadhurst, East Sussex, pleaded guilty to 'causing a nuisance to the public by driving on to the race track at Brands Hatch whilst an endurance race was in progress'. The 1.2litre car belonged to his friend Saskia Fisk, 18, who was in the car with him at the time. His other friend, Zac Copson, 20, videoed the events on his mobile phone from the back seat as Miss Fisk screamed at him to stop. Cottle is seen driving into the circuit, bypassing security checks, and is seen going past mechanics in what looks like a pit lane before making his way on to the track itself. In the clip, Cottle, wearing a black T-shirt, says 'we’re going onto the track'. Miss Fisk, who is clutching a pair of large pink novelty glasses in the passenger seat, says: 'Jack please, I’m begging you, I’m serious, don’t go, stop it, come on.' But he ignores her terrified pleas and she is heard screaming and begging him to stop and at one point says ‘I can’t breathe’. She also tries to grab the steering wheel a couple of times as her voice becomes more hysterical. At the time of the incident, Cottle told MailOnline: 'People are blowing it out of all proportion. It was something out of the ordinary. 'You only live once and I live every day like it is my last. Now I'm getting slated for being different.' Scroll down for video . Ordeal: Terrified Saskia Fisk, 18, from Sevenoaks, Kent, was driven around Brands Hatch in her VW Polo by Cottle. The video shows her trying to grab the steering wheel . Jack Cottle, 21, pictured left, drove Miss Fisk's car onto the racetrack while Zac Copson, 20, pictured right, videoed the events on his mobile phone from the back seat . In the clip, Cottle (pictured) says 'we're going onto the track' and ignores his friend's terrified pleas to stop . Speaking shortly after the incident took place, Miss Fisk said that she had set off in her white VW Polo 1.2 to the track near West Kingsdown, Kent, a 20-minute drive from her family’s £625,000 detached home in Sevenoaks, after asking her parents’ permission. Her frightening experience began 90 minutes into the four-hour endurance race for VW Beetles on June 14. She told the Daily Mail at the time: ‘We were sitting in the car watching the race and they got bored and said wouldn’t it be funny if we raced round the track. I was like, “Yeah, it’d be really funny”. But I didn’t think they’d do it. Even when we were in the paddock I was saying stop. I begged him to stop. ‘I’m angry they’re saying I was egging them on. I was panicking and screaming. I was praying he would stop on the pit lane.’ Unbeknown to the men, Miss Fisk suffers from postural tachycardia syndrome which affects blood pressure. She said medics at the track had to calm her down. Prosecutor Keith Yardy told the court on Friday: 'Shortly before 4pm on June 14 this year, the race had been going for some three hours when the defendant drove a Volkswagen Polo into the pit lane with two passengers. The 22-year-old now faces a custodial sentence after committing the prank after being dared by friends . Prosecutor Keith Hardy said Cottle clearly put  'the race drivers at risk and endangering their safety' At the time, Cottle defended his actions and said 'people are blowing it out of all proportion. It was something out of the ordinary' 'He then entered the race track during the race, clearly putting the race drivers at risk and endangering their safety. 'As a result of his actions, the race was brought to a stop. He was interviewed. He said he was dared to do it and was sorry but would do it again.' Judge Martin Joy warned Cottle that a 'custodial sentence is on the cards' when he next appears in court on the week beginning November 17. Defence counsel Ailsa Williamson said Cottle was 'an immature man' but had the support of his family who attended court with him. She said: 'He was dared by friends. This was a foolish prank that should never have gone this far and he deeply regrets his actions.' Adjourning the case for a pre-sentence report before freeing Cottle on conditional bail, Judge Joy again warned him that a custodial sentence would be considered. The judge said: 'Motor racing is an inherently dangerous sport and quite plainly it was a matter that put persons at risk for their lives. You must understand that the court will be considering a custodial sentence.' Miss Fisk says 'Jack please, I’m begging you, I’m serious, don’t go, stop it, come on' as he laughs .

Orders for shares in 42 companies, which amounted to more than the size of Sweden's economy, were cancelled at 9.25am today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg from the Japan Securities Dealers Association. The biggest order was for Toyota Motor shares at over £1.2 billion, representing 57 per cent of the company's outstanding shares. Share orders worth over £380 billion were cancelled in Japan today after a 'fat finger' trading error .

"Playing video games in 3D can immerse players in an environment like never before. But a study has claimed that in so-doing, the violence in violent video games is amplified. This can cause anger in players more so than those who just played in 2D, suggesting the immersive effects of 3D gaming could be dangerous. A study by The Ohio State University asked people to play violent games in 3D (stock image shown). They found that the effect of 3D could be too immersive for some . The research was carried out by Professor of Communication and Psychology Brad Bushman at The Ohio State University and published in the journal Psychology of Popular Media Culture. Participants were 194 college students, about two-thirds of whom were women. All of the students played the video game Grand Theft Auto IV for 15 minutes. Half were instructed to play violently - kill as many people as possible in the game - and half played non-violently - they went bowling. Playing quick-paced action video games such as Call of Duty or Assassin's Creed can boost your ability to learn new motor skills, researchers have found. They say regular players seem to learn new sensorimotor skills, such as riding a bike or typing, more quickly than non-gamers do. And they say the skills are highly in demand, and useful for many careers - such as advanced surgery, for instance. The study was conducted by  The University of Toronto. They played on a 17-inch 2D screen, a 96-inch 2D screen or on a 96-inch 3D screen while wearing appropriate 3D glasses. Later, all participants reported their mood on a variety of dimensions, including anger. For example, they were asked to rate how angry, annoyed and furious they felt on a scale of one to five. Results showed that for those who played non-violently, it didn't matter if they played in 2D or 3D - their levels of anger were relatively low and unchanged. Those who played violently showed higher levels of anger than nonviolent players no matter how they played, 2D or 3D. But those who played violently on 3D were significantly angrier than those who played violently on the 2D systems. When people were asked to act violently in the game, they felt more angry in real life as well. And the effect was more apparent when playing in 3D rather than 2D. The study did not examine other forms of entertainment such as 3D movies. Shown is an image of someone using 3D glasses with the PlayStation Move . After playing the games, participants were asked several questions measuring how immersed they were in the game. For example, they were asked to rate on a scale of 1 to 7 how much they felt they 'were really 'there' in the game environment' and how much they felt like other characters in the game were real. Results showed that people who played in 3D felt more immersed in the game than did those who played in 2D, and that immersion was related to the increased anger felt by those who played violently. '3D gaming increases anger because the players felt more immersed in the violence when they played violent games,' said Professor Bushman. 'As the technology in video games improves, it has the ability to have stronger effects on players.' He added: 'The combination of violent content and immersive technology like 3D can be troublesome,' Bushman said. 'This is something that needs to be considered by everyone involved - electronics manufacturers, video game developers, consumers, parents and content ratings agencies.' Participants were 194 college students, about two-thirds of whom were women. All of the students played the video game Grand Theft Auto IV for 15 minutes.

"A pair of amorous donkeys who were separated because of complaints over their mating have been reunited at a zoo in Poland. Napoleon and Antosia had been together for 10 years when they got in trouble with outraged mothers who complained about their children having to watch them mate. Local conservative official Lydia Dudziak took up their cause and persuaded the director Stare Zoo in Poznan to have the animals put in separate pens. Napoleon, left, and Antosia, right, stand near each others at their home in Poznan, Poland. The two were separated a week ago because of an outcry over their mating, but have been reunited . However, after a petition was signed by almost 7,000 people, the lovebirds were brought back together today after their agonising week apart. Stare Zoo in Poznan, where the donkeys live . 'It was never our intention for any animals to feel uncomfortable because of their natural behaviours,' the zoo said in a statement. The forced break-up of the long-standing romance has become national news over the past few days - two Facebook pages were made in support of the donkeys with almost 10,000 likes between them - as well as pictures of Napoleon and Antosia in the act. Experts weighed in, saying the separation could hurt their psychological wellbeing, and politicians were asked about it on the country's leading news programmes. 'Animals separated by sex into different cages? It's complete idiocy,' said Stefan Niesiolowski, a lawmaker with the governing party, Civic Platform. Even the spokesman for Law and Justice, the conservative party that Ms Dudziak belongs to, would not come to her defence. 'It's a level of absurdity that has been crossed to such an extent that I don't even want to read or know about this,' Adam Hofman said yesterday evening. In their decade together, Napoleon and Antosia have produced six offspring, including two-month old Tadeusz.","Donkeys were together for 10 years before angry mothers split them up .

"Labour has slumped to the same level of support that saw Gordon Brown ousted from Number 10. The party, under Ed Miliband leadership, is back at 29 per cent in the polls, trailing the Conservatives on 30 per cent, according to a survey released by Lord Ashcroft this afternoon. In a further blow, more than a third of Labour voters would now prefer to see David Cameron as Prime Minister than Mr Miliband after the next election. The Labour Party is back at just 29 per cent in the polls - its lowest level since May 2010 when Gordon Brown lost the election . Among Labour supporters, 19 per cent are dissatisfied with Mr Cameron but would still prefer him as Prime Minister. A further 18 per cent are satisfied with the job he is doing in Number 10. The poll comes amid growing concern in the Labour Party over its dramatic slump  in Scotland, which one survey suggested could see Mr Miliband lose almost 40 seats north of the border. This week’s Ashcroft National Poll, conducted over the weekend, is the first time Labour has fallen below 30 per cent under Mr Miliband’s leadership. Ukip were down two points to 16 per cent, while the Liberal Democrats were up three to 10 cent - the first time they have broken into double figures in Lord Ashcroft’s surveys. The Greens, meanwhile, are up one point at 6 per cent and the SNP have 5 per cent, despite only standing in Scotland. Lord Ashcroft said Labour were ‘continuing their slow but unmistakeable decline from highs of 36 per cent in July and 35 per cent in early September’. He added: ‘This is the first week in which Labour have dropped below 30 per cent in my poll, and the second time the two leading parties have scored less than 60 per cent between them.’ Mr Miliband's personal ratings are hampering Labour's overall support, Lord Ashcroft's survey has suggested . While the Labour Party is at the same level of support as 2010, the Conservatives and Lib Dems have both seen their support collapse. Ukip and the Greens meanwhile have seen their support surge . In Lord Ashcroft’s poll on July 14, Labour were picking up 31 per cent of 2010 Lib Dem voters, while shedding just 12 per cent of their own supporters at the last election to UKIP and the Greens. This week, only 26 per cent of former Lib Dems naming a party said they would vote Labour, while 11 per cent had switched to UKIP and five per cent to the Greens. At the same time, the SNP’s share in Scotland has more than doubled, mostly at the expense of Labour. According to Lord Ashcroft there is further bad news for Labour as voters continue to prefer Mr Cameron as Prime Minister by wide margins. Overall 61 per cent said they preferred Mr Cameron as Prime Minister, whether they were satisfied or not with his performance. The Labour leader is facing an uphill battle to become Prime Minister after the next election, but has insisted Mr Cameron cannot win a majority . Less than a quarter (24 per cent, down four points) said they would rather see Mr Miliband as Prime Minister, including just one in five swing voters and only 13 per cent of UKIP supporters. Only 55 per cent of Labour voters said they would rather see Miliband in Number 10. One in four voters say they would be better off if the Tories were in power after the next election – compared to just 16 per cent who said a Labour government would leave them in a better position. A third of Ukip voters were much more likely to think they would be better off with the Conservatives than under Labour – with only six per cent of Nigel Farage supporters saying a Labour government would be better for them.","Labour are back to 29% in the polls, behind the Tories on 30% .

"Lady Tatiana Howard, who was fined £500 after admitting driving her black Porsche without due care or attention, when she struck a pedestrian . An aristocrat has been fined after running over a pedestrian while driving her Porsche to her King's Road furniture boutique on the wrong side of the road. Lady Tatiana Howard was fined £500 after striking David Laing on North End Road, West Kensington when she attempted to overtake a row of stationary cars on the way to her store Tatiana Tafur in Fulham. After being hit Mr Laing sustained injuries to his leg, neck and head and required hospital treatment. At Lavender Hill Magistrates Court, Lady Tatiana, 49, who lives in a £1million house in Burford, Oxfordshire, admitted driving her black Porsche Boxter without due care and attention. Bench chairwoman Cathy Jago told the mother-of-two: 'We have heard that you drove in a dangerous manner. 'You were driving on the wrong side of the road and that resulted in a pedestrian being hit by your vehicle and him being taken to hospital by ambulance.' Prosecutor Melanie Hardwick told the court that it was 10am when Mr Laing was crossing the road outside North End Medical Centre. She said: 'He says that as he approached the middle of the road he looked to his left and to his right and as he stepped out he was hit by the Porsche. 'The driver said she was rushing to get to work. 'Mr Laing received injuries to his shoulder, leg, neck and head as a result of being struck by the defendant. 'She got out of her car to ask if he was okay and an ambulance was called.' The court heard Lady Tatiana, who studied History of Art at Sotheby's, already has six penalty points on her driver's licence for using a mobile phone and speeding. Her lawyer Mr Mark Haslam told the court: 'The impact speed was in the region of 10mph and the injuries were not described as serious. 'The traffic was solid in two lanes and she wished to turn right into Star Road and pulled out of her lane, having checked there was no traffic coming towards her. Lady Tatiana was driving to her boutique furniture shop, Tatiana Tafur on the fashionable King's Road, pictured, when she struck the pedestrian in nearby North End Road in West Kensington . 'The pedestrian came from between vehicles, from behind a stationary white van and did not choose to use a pedestrian crossing. 'By being on the wrong side of the road she accepts that it was driving without due care and attention. 'All insurance issues have been settled and there was no significant personal injury claim,' added Mr Haslam. Asking the court not to impose six or more penalty points, which would result in an automatic ban, he said: 'She is a married lady and her husband works in London, where he lives during the week. Mr Laing was struck by Lady Tatiana's vehicle on North End Road, West Kensington, pictured . 'She has twin children, aged seven, and they go to school 18 miles away and there is no public transport. 'She works for her manufacturing company that designs furniture and employs four people, but it is not in the best financial health and the last account showed losses of £8,000. 'She works from home, but also drives to her work three times a week.' She was also ordered to pay £85 costs, a £50 victim surcharge and received five penalty points.","Lady Tatiana Howard was driving on North End Road, West Kensington .

"Life beyond the Earth seems 'inevitable' given the immensity of the universe, according to planetary scientist Dr Sara Seager (pictured) Astronomers are standing on a 'great threshold' of space exploration that could see evidence of extra-terrestrial life being discovered in the next 20 years, an expert has claimed. Life beyond the Earth seems 'inevitable' given the immensity of the universe, according to planetary scientist Dr Sara Seager. In the coming decades, chemical fingerprints of life written in the atmospheres of planets orbiting nearby stars could be found by the next generation of space telescopes. Writing in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Dr Seager, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), said: 'We can say with certainty that, for the first time in human history, we are finally on the verge of being able to search for signs of life beyond our solar system around the nearest hundreds of stars.' Astronomers now know that statistically, every star in our galaxy, the Milky Way, should have at least one planet, and small rocky worlds like the Earth are common. 'Our own galaxy has 100 billion stars and our universe has upwards of 100 billion galaxies - making the chance for life elsewhere seem inevitable based on sheer probability,' said Dr Seager. In the next decade or two, a handful of 'potentially habitable' exoplanets will have been found with atmospheres that can be studied in detail by sophisticated space telescopes. The first of these next generation telescopes will be Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) due to be launched in 2018. It will analyse the atmospheres of dozens of 'super-Earths' - rocky planets somewhat larger than our own planet - including several that could harbour life. Studying a planet's atmosphere for signs of life involves capturing starlight filtering through its gases. In the next decade or two, a handful of 'potentially habitable' exoplanets will have been found with atmospheres that can be studied in detail by sophisticated space telescopes. The first of these next generation telescopes will be Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (pictured) due to be launched in 2018 . Different elements absorb different wavelengths of light, providing information about the atmosphere's make-up. Living things, from bacteria to large animals, are expected to produce 'biosignature' gases that could be detected in a planet's atmosphere. They include oxygen, ozone, nitrous oxide, and methane. The problem faced by scientists is that some of these, such as methane, can be generated by geological processes as well as life. The likelihood of false positives could be reduced by searching for rarer biosignature gases more closely tied to living systems, such as dimethyl sulphide (DMS), and methanethiol, said Dr Seager. But she pointed out that observations using telescopes such as the JWST, which will focus on backlit transiting planets that happen to passing in front of their parent stars, will be limited. A 'starshade' is an umbrella-like screen tens of metres in diameter placed tens of thousands of kilometres in front of a space telescope lens. The starshade is designed to cast a shadow blocking out light from a star while leaving a planet's reflected light unaffected . Aliens are real - not little green men visiting Earth as depicted in movies, but rather microbial life in our own solar system and intelligent life beyond. That’s according to two leading Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (Seti) researchers, who yesterday took part in a hearing at the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology in Washington DC. During the talk dubbed ‘Astrobiology and the Search for Life in the Universe’ in May, the scientists laid out the evidence and reasoning for believing we are not alone. The speech was made by Dr Seth Shostak, Senior Astronomer at the Seti Institute in California, and Dr Dan Wethimer, Director of Seti Research. And, they added, with adequate support it is likely we will find alien life in some form or another within 20 years. Dr Wethimer said: ‘It would be bizarre if we are alone,’ he told the committee. ‘It would be a cramped mind that didn’t wonder what other life is out there.’ Maximising the chances of finding evidence of extraterrestrial life will require a technological leap to methods of directly imaging large numbers of exoplanets. Such an undertaking is daunting, given that directly imaging an Earth-like exoplanet is equivalent to picking out a firefly in the glare of a searchlight from a distance of 2,500 miles. Yet two techniques now under development could make direct imaging of Earth twins possible. One involves specialised optics to block out interfering starlight and reveal the presence of orbiting exoplanets. The other is the 'starshade' - an umbrella-like screen tens of metres in diameter placed tens of thousands of kilometres in front of a space telescope lens. The starshade is designed to cast a shadow blocking out light from a star while leaving a planet's reflected light unaffected. 'To be confident of finding a large enough pool of exoplanets to search for biosignature gases, we require the ability to directly image exoplanets orbiting 1,000 or more of the nearest sun-like stars,' said Dr Seager. She added: 'We stand on a great threshold in the human history of space exploration...If life is prevalent in our neighbourhood of the galaxy, it is within our reach to be the first generation in human history to finally cross this threshold and learn if there is life of any kind beyond Earth.' 'Our own galaxy has 100 billion stars and our universe has upwards of 100 billion galaxies - making the chance for life elsewhere seem inevitable based on sheer probability,' said Dr Seager.

"Attorney General Eric Holder's abrupt announcement that he intends to leave the Obama administration as soon as the president is able to find someone to take over for him was initiated by his doctor wife's concerns about his health, a news report revealed on Thursday. Holder was rushed in an ambulance to a Washington, D.C. hospital in February after feeling faint and having a shortness of breath. Doctors gave the Justice Department official the OK to return to work, but soon after the incident, rumors began swirling that Holder could leave the Obama administration before the end of the year. Politico Magazine reported on Thursday that 'under pressure' from his wife, Sharon Malone, an obstetrician and gynecologist, Holder decided to make the jump now before Republicans potentially take over the Senate in the Midterm elections and make it too difficult for the president to replace him. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Attorney General Eric Holder told attendees of a voting rights event during the 2014 Congressional Black Caucus Annual Legislative Conference in Washington, D.C. today that he has 'no intention of letting up' during his final days in office . Holder kisses his wife, Sharon Malone, right, after announcing his resignation at the White House yesterday. A news report today claims that Malone, a doctor, pressured her husband to leave the Justice Department because she was worried about his health . 'It was a quit-now or never-quit moment,' a former administration official told Politico. 'You didn’t want confirmation hearings in 2015 if the Republicans control the Senate. So if he didn’t do it now, there was no way he could ever do it.' Sources who claim to be familiar with the attorney general’s thinking told the Washington Post said Holder had thought about leaving earlier in tenure, at the height of a gun-walking scandal in 2012 and again last summer, but he didn't want to exit on bad note. Holder, one of only three original Obama administration secretaries, has seen no shortage of controversy in the six years he's served the president. From the Fast and Furious gun walking scandal that led to him being held in contempt by the House of Representatives to the Justice Department's crusade against Republican-passed voter identification laws, Holder, the fourth longest serving Attorney General in American history, has seen few periods of his tenure that were not marked by polarizing action. A hero to progressives and the African-American community, President Barack Obama lauded Holder's work to advance civil rights at a tearful press conference on Thursday afternoon. 'Under his watch,' Obama said, 'the department has brought a record number of prosecutions for human trafficking, and for hate crimes – because no one in America should be afraid to walk down the street because of the color of their skin, the love in their heart, the faith they practice, or the disabilities that they live with.' With years in his eyes, an emotional Holder took the podium on Thursday to say a few words about his six years on the job . Obama and Holder share an embrace after delivering remarks on Holder's resignation in the State Dining Room of the White House on Thursday . The first black attorney general has long been a thorn in conservative lawmaker's sides, however, they were vocal yesterday about their eagerness to see him go. He has 'chosen to politicize his office,' and 'he's just simply not done his job well,' House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Darrel Issa told Fox News' Megyn Kelly last night. Issa, who led the charge in the House to bring legal action against Holder, said he hoped the president would bring in a less divisive top cop. 'I think there's very little chance there'll be somebody similar that could be confirmed by the Senate for these last two years,' Issa said. 'Even if the Senate changes hands during the lame duck [session], they're not going to have a lightning rod like Eric Holder,' he predicted. Texas  Sen. John Cornyn shared a similar sentiment in a statement on Thursday. 'The nation deserves an attorney general whose loyalty to the justice system will trump loyalty to a political party, and I hope the president will nominate someone who will uphold the basic standards of honesty, transparency, and accountability that have been so glaringly absent in this Justice Department,' Cornyn. Undeterred by statements from his detractors in the last 24 hours, a defiant Holder promised friends and allies on Friday that he would keep fighting for the ideals they hold dear until his final day in office. At a Congressional Black Caucus event this morning Holder addressed the elephant in the room right off the bat and reminded attendees that his term as Attorney General 'has not ended.' 'OK? Let's just make that clear. It has not ended,' he said. I woke up today and I was still the Attorney General of the United States,' he added, eliciting laughter from the crowd who had gathered at the early morning panel to wish him goodbye. Noting that his time at Justice 'will draw to a close in the coming months,' Holder told his friends, 'I want you to know that my commitment to this work...will never waiver.' 'I have no intention of letting up, I have no intention of slowing down.' Holder said he was confident that the advocates in the room and the U.S. attorneys across the nation would carry on the fight for for equality. 'No matter what my path will be, no matter where I will be,' Holder said, he would continue to fight for equal justice. In a one-on-one with the Daily Beast today Holder said he’s 'not quite done thinking' about what his next move is, he suggested he will continue to work on criminal-justice reform, something Holder designated as his 'signature achievement' as head of the Justice Department. 'I’d like to continue being involved with issues that animated my time as attorney general—criminal-justice reform and civil rights especially,' Holder told the Daily Beast. 'I don’t just want to give speeches; I’d like to involve myself in this work in a systematic way.'","Holder was rushed in an ambulance to a Washington, D.C. hospital in February after feeling faint and having a shortness of breath .
A news report revealed Thursday that 'under pressure' from his wife, an obstetrician and gynecologist, Holder decided to leave his job .

"Relations between Downing Street and the Home Office were under growing strain last night as David Cameron responded to speculation about Theresa May’s leadership ambitions by suggesting he ignored such ‘rubbish’. The Prime Minister used a TV broadcast to say that he was not concerned about being a ‘popular guy’, adding: ‘It’s so vital that you look to the horizon and not tomorrow’s headlines, because there is a sort of daily battle of this story and that event. ‘It’s all rubbish. What matters is: Are you taking the right long-term decisions for the good of the country?’ Death stare: Cameron has dismissed the idea that Theresa May is positioning herself as his successor . His remarks were widely seen as reference to two weeks of stories claiming Mrs May is positioning herself to succeed him. For the second week running at Prime . Minister’s Questions, Labour leader Ed Miliband attempted to taunt Mr . Cameron over the swirling rumours– saying the Prime Minister had been . ‘overruled’ by the Home Secretary on the issue of a minimum price for . alcohol. Mrs May, who is hailed as Britain’s . answer to Angela Merkel by her allies, responded with what is becoming a . trademark ‘death stare’. Unusually, she did not take her seat . on the Government front bench for Prime Minister’s Questions, instead . watching proceedings from a position alongside the Speaker’s Chair. Not concerned: The Prime Minister has said he does not want to be the 'popular guy' in the eyes of the press . The Home Secretary’s allies are . infuriated by charges of disloyalty, insisting a weekend speech ranging . far beyond her brief which was interpreted as paving the way for a . future leadership bid was cleared personally in advance by Mr Cameron. They were outraged by a leak from . Tuesday’s political Cabinet revealing that she had been admonished by . name by Education Secretary Michael Gove. Downing Street was forced to disown a . report claiming that Mr Cameron had ‘long nurtured doubts about Theresa . May’s effectiveness as Home Secretary’, insisting he had always . regarded her as ‘first class’. ‘Say what you want about how sparkly . or otherwise she is, she has been effective and even her enemies would . concede that. This just makes them sound on another planet’ said one . supporter of Mrs May. But her camp was further enraged by . BBC political editor Nick Robinson quoting people close to the Prime . Minister as branding the Home Secretary ‘grotesquely naïve’. Members of the Prime Minister’s inner . circle, meanwhile, said they suspected the Home Office had leaked the . fact that it has killed off the Prime Minister’s plan to impose a 45p . per unit minimum price for alcohol. Mrs May and other ministers, . including her Liberal Democrat deputy Jeremy Browne and Commons leader . Andrew Lansley – had suggested the move would be politically suicidal at . a time when the cost of living is already rising. Some of the Home Secretary’s . colleagues agree that she has overstepped the mark, though her allies . have made clear she would do nothing to challenge Mr Cameron and would . only consider a leadership run if he quit after losing the next . election.","Cameron said he doesn't need to be popular in the eyes of the press .

"With its gentle drama and quaint childhood adventures, Little House On The Prairie painted a picture of wholesome family life in 19th century Midwest America. Set in the God-fearing town of Independence, Kansas, plotlines rarely ventured beyond the . realms of Sunday School and town gossip and real trouble meant somebody . being late for dinner. But behind these tales of youthful innocence that brought fame to the town across the world, lurks a ghoulish story of real-life abduction and serial killing that author Laura Ingalls Wilder neglected to mention. Some 17 miles south of Independence, the township of Osage became the scene of a brutal campaign of murder by a family that became known as the Bloody Benders. The family: John Sr spoke with a gruff, guttural voice that was barely understandable while his wife was apparently so unfriendly that her neighbors took to calling her 'She-Devil' The children: While their parents tended to keep themselves to themselves, John Jr. (left) and Kate (right) were known about the town of Osage and regularly attended Sunday church. She also claimed to be psychic healer . The family consisted of John 'Pa' Bender, 60, his wife Mrs. 'Ma' Bender (later referred to as Kate Sr. since no one knew her given name), 55, son John Jr. and daughter Kate. Originally immigrants from Europe, John Sr reportedly had such a gruff voice that, coupled with his strong foreign accent, him barely understandable while his wife was apparently so unfriendly that her neighbours took to calling her 'She-Devil'. While their parents tended to keep themselves to themselves, the children John Jr., and Kate, both in their 20s, were known about the town and regularly . attended Sunday church. Kate also claimed to be psychic healer. Television: The Little House on the Prairie ran from 1974 to 1983. Set in the God-fearing town of Independence, Kansas, plotlines rarely ventured beyond the realms of Sunday School and real trouble meant somebody being late for dinner . The family, believed to have been of German or Dutch origin, ran a bed and breakfast for travellers passing across the frontier. They lived in the back of their cabin. In the front, beginning in 1871, they operated a small inn and store. It was there that they took to murdering and robbing at least a dozen travellers who stayed at the lodging between 1871 and 1873. So many disappearances were reported over that period that it is unclear exactly how many victims there actually were. Mass grave: This photograph from 1873 shows the graves found behind the Bender farm. It was noticed that the Benders' garden was always freshly plowed but never planted . More bodies: This is a stereographic photo shows a grave found under a trap door at the Bender house. Around a dozen bodies were found, including various body parts . It is believed their method was to smash their guests over the head with a hammer during dinner from behind a strategically-placed curtain before tipping their body through a trap door into a made-to-measure cellar. One of the women would then leap on the victim and cut their throat to seal their death. Once in the cellar, they stripped the body, taking anything they could find of value, and later buried somewhere on the property, often in the orchard. It was noticed that the Benders’ garden was always freshly ploughed but never planted. Suspicions were aroused and rumours spread within the village after a number of locals went missing but no official inquiries were made. It was not until . Dr William York had vanished after . setting out in search of neighbour George Loncher and his daughter who . themselves had vanished after leaving Independence for a better life. Neither Mr Locher, his daughter, or Dr York were ever found. Dr York's brother, Kansas State Senator Alexander M. York, launched a hunt for his missing sibling but to no avail. On . April 3, Colonel York returned to the inn with armed men after a woman . fled the lodging claiming Ma Bender had threatened her with knives. House of horror: The Benders would smash their guests over the head with a hammer from behind a strategically-placed curtain before tipping their body through a trap door into a made-to-measure cellar . Ma allegedly could not understand . English while the younger Benders denied the claim. When York repeated . the allegation, Ma flew into a rage and branded the woman a witch who had . cursed her coffee and ordered the men to leave her house. It was this outburst that revealed for . the first time that 'her sense of the English language' was much better . than had been thought. Before York left, Kate bid him to pay . a second visit the next Friday night when she promised to use her . clairvoyant skills and contact the spirit world to help him find his . missing brother. The . men with York were convinced the Benders were guilty and wanted to hang . them all but York insisted that evidence must be found. However, as suspicions strengthened and the finger of blame pointed stoutly towards the family. As . more people vanished, a town meeting decided the perpetrators of the . crimes had to be found and a search of every home in the area was . authorised. Pa Bender and his son both attended the meeting. Then, . within two weeks of the meeting a passer by noticed the Benders' livestock had not been fed and it became clear the family had slipped . into the night, never to be seen again. Little Slaughterhouse on the Prairie: But behind tales of youthful innocence that brought fame to the area across the world, lurks a ghoulish story of real-life abduction and serial killing that author Laura Ingalls Wilder failed to mention . When the house was finally searched, their possessions were gone. What remained was a grim collection of more than a dozen bodies and various body parts buried in the property's grounds. One was even discovered in the well. The first to be found was that of Dr York. He was buried face down with his feet barely below the surface among trees in the orchard. As more corpses were unearthed, the true tally of their murderous spree gradually became clear. All victims but one had been hit over the head and their throats cut. Just the body of a young girl was found with no injuries sufficient to cause death. It was speculated that she had been strangled or buried alive alongside her mother. A state-wide manhunt was launched but the family was never found. Their true identities have been the source of speculation ever since. In the weeks following the discovery, 12 men 'of bad repute in general' were arrested, accused of  disposing of the victims' stolen goods. In Thayer, 12 miles north of the Bender inn, inquiries revealed that four people fitting the Benders' description had boarded a train for Humboldt, Kansas. The Humboldt station manager said that there the family split with . John Jr. and Kate taking a train south, and Ma and Pa Bender, . carrying a doghide trunk (possibly loaded with money), had taken a second train to St. Louis. A team of lawmen managed to pick up the family's trail as far as Texas and tailed them to El Paso and into the Chihuahua Desert. But they lost track in the end and were forced to give up and return home. In October 31, 1889, two women arrested for larceny in Niles, Michigan, were identified as Ma and Kate Bender. They were brought back to Kansas. But after being held for two months they were released on grounds of insufficient evidence against them. There were various alleged sightings since but none led to any arrests. There have been suggestions that they joined a troupe of outlaws in New mexico, others that they fled to the East Coast, even to Europe. In a speech at a book fair in a Detroit department store in 1937, Laura Ingalls Wilder spoke of how the murders affected the community in which she lived. 'The night of the day the bodies were found a neighbor rode up to our . house and talked earnestly with Pa,' she said. 'Pa took his rifle down from its . place over the door and said to Ma, ""The vigilantes are called out."" 'Then he saddled a horse and rode away with the neighbor. It was late the . next day when he came back and he never told us where he had been. 'For . several years there was more or less a hunt for the Benders and reports . that they had been seen here or there. At such times Pa always said in a . strange tone of finality, ""They will never be found.""'","Little House On The Prairie painted a picture of wholesome family life in 19th century Midwest America in the town of Independence, Kansas .

"Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall has become the latest celebrity to be exposed for investing in an alleged £1.2billion tax-avoidance scheme. The River Cottage TV chef was one of 229 individuals, including former BBC chairman Lord Grade, Britain’s highest-earning MP and footballers, who paid into Phoenix Film Partners LLP. Each put an average of £5.2million into the partnership that offered tax breaks for investing in Hollywood movies. Scroll down for video . Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, pictured, has become the latest celebrity to be exposed for investing in an alleged £1.2billion tax-avoidance scheme . Complex deals meant investors could claim substantial tax relief – potentially leaving them with thousands of pounds of profit. It was initially approved by HMRC, but officials wrote to Phoenix investors in May last year rejecting their claims for tax relief. Mr Fearnley-Whittingstall follows George Michael, Katie Melua, Sir Michael Caine, Gary Barlow and BBC presenter Anne Robinson who were all criticised for using a separate aggressive tax avoidance scheme in July. Phoenix used the investor loans to buy distribution and production rights to films including the 2010 re-make of the 1980s TV series The A-Team and Gulliver’ s Travels. Investors could make significant profits if the films prospered at the box office. However, Ingenious Media, which ran the partnership, admitted in 2011 that ‘box office performance had not met expectations’ and was unlikely to deliver ‘significant upside’. Regardless of the poor returns, investors were able to claim tax relief worth about half the cash they put in. Among those investing was Tory MP Geoffrey Cox QC, who earned around £400,000 last year in legal fees along with his £67,000 annual parliamentary salary. It is not known the exact amount that each investor put into the scheme or whether they have already claimed tax relief. Gary Barlow, left, and Lord Grade, right have also been criticised for paying into tax avoidance schemes . Mr Fearnley-Whittingstall said he left Phoenix in June after first joining in 2008 believing he was making a ‘bona fide’ investment in the British film industry. He added: ‘It seems from reports in the media that HMRC does have reservations about some of these types of investments. 'I always want to be transparent about and indeed comfortable with my investments and my tax affairs, so earlier this year I resigned my subscription to this particular investment and handed back all the tax gain I had made, plus interest, to HMRC. ‘Any earlier correspondence with HMRC was handled by my financial advisors at the time. I now have a new accountancy firm and financial advisor for my affairs.’ Mr Cox said he was advised that Phoenix ‘had been submitted to HMRC and had met with no objection or query’ and he had instructed his financial advisers that he ‘did not wish to be involved in aggressive tax avoidance’. Lord Grade said: ‘I did not regard this as tax avoidance. I wouldn’t have done it if it hadn’t been HMRC-approved.’ Ingenious denied that Phoenix, or any of its other film and music investment schemes, are tax-avoidance structures. A spokesman said Phoenix was a ‘bona fide film partnership’ that traded for ‘under six months before the capital was returned to partners in March 2009’. Phoenix is one of more than 1,200 alleged avoidance schemes identified by HMRC where investors are being forced to hand over unpaid tax before their disputes are settled by a tribunal.","River Cottage chef was one of 229 people paying into Phoenix Film Partners LLP .

"Shy Dahan allegedly used bogus bank paperwork to convince casino staff to give him credit to gamble. He denies one count of fraud by false representation . A businessman pretended to be a real estate tycoon and used bogus bank paperwork in order to gamble huge sums in a Mayfair casino, a court heard today. Shy Dahan, 33, allegedly used false Credit Suisse documents to mislead club staff into thinking he had more than £1million in the bank. Southwark Crown Court heard he produced papers from the Gibraltar arm of the bank in a bid to gain credit with the Playboy Club in Mayfair, London. The global bank had produced a letter for Dahan stating he had liquid assets of £1million after he duped them into believing he was the owner of the successful S Capital Group. Dahan, from Mayfair, and formerly of Tel Aviv in Israel, denies one count of fraud by false representation. It is alleged he joined the Park Lane club in November 2012, handed staff his Credit Suisse bank details and referred them to his website to convince them of his credit worthiness. An article on Dahan's website claimed he was someone who 'fulfils his dreams, turning visions into soaring skyscrapers and swarming estates'. It boasted that Dahan was a 'unique global entrepreneur' and a 'true visionary' with the 'Midas touch'. 'King Midas was a king in Greek mythology, anything he touched turned to gold,' said Prosecutor Simon Wild. 'In an email to the Playboy Club, he described himself as being the CEO of S Capital Group, he said he was the CEO and founder of S Capital Group and he referred the Playboy Club to the website.' But jurors heard the blurb about Dahan, his company and details of ongoing projects was directly lifted from a genuine real estate firm's website called Canada-Israel. Mr Wild added the website was 'designed to big up Mr Dahan and impress anybody that wanted to find out about him to see what a big deal he was, what a big player he was in the real estate business. 'It was a phony website designed to deceive all kinds of different people, indeed to show his credit worthiness and presumably that is the reason he referred the Playboy Club to it. 'He wanted to join the Playboy Club, apparently that is quite easy to do, you don't have to go through any hoops but in addition to being a mere member, the defendant also wanted to be allowed credit. 'That is to say to be allowed to cash cheques and to have credit.' Jurors were told Dahan wanted to gamble huge sums of cash without having it on his person. The court heard Dahan used false Credit Suisse bank documents to convince staff he had £1million in the bank . On November 27 in 2012, Dahan visited the London casino and produced the Credit Suisse letter, claiming that he had more than £1million in his account. His actual bank balance at the time the letter was produced was $439,000 - approximately £300,000. It is alleged the letter may have been produced with the help of a cohort at the bank. Mr Wild added: 'What it ends up being is he was allowed credit. 'He won lots, he lost lots, he won lots, he lost lots, in the end he ended up owing £230,000. 'Having told a lie about his means in the false letter, having referred them to the misleading website, he was allowed credit and he ended up owing them £230,000 - an amount which I think now has been paid back to them.' Dahan, of Mayfair, joined the Playboy Club on Old Park Lane in November 2012. Jurors were told he wanted to gamble huge sums without having cash on him .
