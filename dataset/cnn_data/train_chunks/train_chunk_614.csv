A former police officer has been found guilty today of his wife's murder after she was found shot dead in their burning home. Brett Seacat, 37, was accused of killing 34-year-old Vashti Seacat, 16 days after she filed for divorce in 2011. Her charred body was found next to a melted gas container on the remains of her bed, along with a .44-caliber pistol at their home in Kansas. Scroll down for video . Guilty verdict: Brett Seacat, pictured in court today, was found guilty of murdering his wife Vashti in 2011 at their Kansas home . A Kingman County jury on Tuesday found Seacat guilty of first-degree murder, aggravated arson and two counts of aggravated endangering a child. Seacat showed little emotion in court as he stood while the judge read the verdict after less than a day of deliberations by the jury. Victim: Vashti Seacat was found dead in a fire at her home in 2011, shortly after she filed for divorce from her husband . In closing arguments on Monday, prosecutors portrayed Brett Seacat as a manipulative man who used his law enforcement background to make it look like his wife shot herself. The defense tried to cast reasonable doubt by repeatedly pointing out that even an experienced coroner couldn't decide whether the death was suicide or homicide. Seacat is a former Sedgwick County deputy who was an instructor at the Kansas Law Enforcement Training Center when his wife's body was found. He and the couple's two sons, aged two and four, escaped from the fire. Prosecutors said Seacat shot his wife, then set their home on fire to cover it up. He had claimed that his wife was depressed and set fire to their family home in Kingman before shooting herself. Seacat is due to be sentenced on August 5 with the state seeking 50 years in prisoner for the former deputy. After escaping the blaze with the couple’s two children in 2011, Seacat called 911 and said his wife had committed suicide. Because of burns to the body, a . coroner could not determine whether the gunshot was self-inflicted. Posecutors alleged that Seacat killed his wife at about 4am and then set fire to their home to hide the evidence. The mother-of-two had filed for . divorce a couple of weeks before her death. Her husband had been served . with divorce papers in the days before the fire. Mrs Seacat had started making plans with her friends a week before her death on April 30, 2011. Relief: Julie Hostetler, mother of Vashti Seacat, hugs another family member after the guilty verdict was read . Justice served: Sydney Woodside, niece of Vashti Seacat, and her uncle Rich Forrest, brother of Vashti Seacat, hug in court on Tuesday . College friend Sarai Tobon said that Vashti had also made plans to go to a concert in Wichita and to take a trip to Mexico with her sister. 'I . didn’t see any signs of depression,' Ms Tobon said. 'She was saddened . by [the divorce], but at the same time she had this optimistic look . about her future.' Friend Jaime Arnold told the court during the trial about text . messages sent between her and Mrs Seacat the day before the fire, in . which they discussed Ms Arnold buying a treadmill from her, which she . was due to collect on the day of the fire. Another friend Jill Aaron told the court Mrs Seacat had said her husband threatened to run . away with their sons but denied that he ever . physically abused her. Trial: KBI agent Brian Carroll shows the court a photo of the bedroom Vashti Seacat's body was found . 'She was really nervous,' Ms Aaron said. 'I knew that she was terrified he would do something.' The court was also told by Ms Arnold that Brett Seacat was supposed to be out of the house by May 1, 2011. In . text messages sent to Ms Tobon on April 28, Mrs Seacat said her husband . was 'floored', 'angry' and 'sad' about the divorce and had agreed to . work on their marriage. The . messages from Mrs Seacat allegedly said her husband had told her he . would wait for her and take her back when she was ready. But Ms Tobon also testified that on more than one occasion in April 2011, Mrs Seacat had said she was worried her husband would take the boys and run away or kill himself.","Brett Seacat murdered wife Vashti, the mother of his two sons, 16 days after she filed for divorce in 2011 .

Sadly for the pensioner whose account received hundreds of millions of euros more than the intended transfer amount, the funds were quickly swept away again. And the boss of the bank clerk who made the error was fired for letting the mistake slip through. A court in the state of Hesse, central Germany, heard that the clerk was supposed to transfer just €62.40 (£53) from a bank account belonging to a retiree. But instead 'fell asleep for an instant, while pushing onto the number 2 key on the keyboard'. Error: The boss of a clerk who fell asleep while making a transfer - adding millions to a pensioner's account - was unfairly dismissed, according to a German court . That 'instant' resulted in a multimillion-euros transfer instead. In fact the pensioner received a huge €222,222,222.22 that day, according to the Telegraph. The bank discovered the mistake shortly afterwards and corrected the error, but the clerk's boss was fired. The case was taken to court by the 48-year-old female colleague - who was fired for the error last April. At that time she said she had examined more than 800 documents, most were checked in less than two seconds. The bank, which was not named in the ruling, published online, claimed the supervisor had tried to deceive her superiors by failing to properly check transfer payments. The Hesse Labour court ruled, however, that the plaintiff should have received a warning and not a dismissal and said she should be reinstated in her job. Although it was a 'terrible mistake' there was no evidence she had sought to cause deliberate harm to her employer, and she should be reinstated, the ruling said.

Duane Buck, 51, was convicted in Texas of killing his ex-girlfriend and a man in her apartment in July 1995 and has been on death row since. While his guilt is not being questioned, Buck's lawyers say the jury was unfairly influenced and that he should . receive a new sentencing hearing. Scroll down for video . Campaign: Duane Buck, 51, was convicted of killing his ex-girlfriend and a man in her apartment in July 1995 and has been on death row since . In 2011, Buck's attorneys appealed to the Supreme . Court and Texas Governor Rick Perry to block the execution, saying a . psychologist testified that black people were more likely to commit . violence. Psychologist Dr Walter Quijano, . who had been called by Buck's defense lawyer to testify about his future . threat to society, testified to this under cross-examination by the . prosecutor. He was asked: . 'You have determined that the sex factor, that a male is more violent . than a female because that’s just the way it is, and that the race . factor, black increases the future dangerousness for various complicated . reasons; is that correct?' Dr Quijano said: 'Yes.' The Supreme Court halted the execution and the justices said they would review an appeal in his case. In a new documentary on the case, Christana Swarns, director of the . criminal justice project for the NAACP legal defense fund, said: 'It’s a stunning and outrageous case. 'You have someone condemned to die because he is African American.' Buck's . case is one of six convictions that then Texas Attorney General John .

Christana Swarns, director of the criminal justice project for the NAACP legal defense fund, said: 'It's a stunning and outrageous case' In custody: Buck has been on death row since his conviction in 1995 . In the other five cases, new punishment hearings were held and each convict again was sentenced to die. State attorneys contend Buck's case was different from the others and that the racial reference was a small part of larger testimony about prison populations. Perry is a capital punishment supporter and as frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination his actions now are coming under closer scrutiny. The reprieve from the nation's highest court came nearly two hours into a six-hour window when Buck could have been taken to the death chamber. Buck was convicted of gunning down ex-girlfriend Debra Gardner, 32, and Kenneth Butler, 33, outside Houston on July, 30, 1995, a week after Buck and Gardner broke up. A third person, Buck's stepsister, Phyllis Taylor, also was wounded, though she has since forgiven Buck and sought for his death sentence to be commuted to life in prison. Buck's attorneys went to the Supreme Court after losing appeals in lower courts.A clemency request to the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, all of whom are Perry appointees, also failed. Now former Governor Mark White, prosecutor in the case Linda Geffin, members of the Texas legislature and retired prosecutors and judges are petitioning the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals for a new sentencing hearing.

Traditionally, interns are paid a pittance to do all the jobs no else wants to do in an effort to get experience in a competitive job market. At Google however, not only do interns work on developing projects, they are paid $6,000 a month and given a host of benefits including housing, gym membership, bowling and food - all for free. The web giant's student opportunities were already coveted, even before the release of Vince Vaughan and Owen Wilson's film The Internships this week. Open to opportunity: As competition for tech talent grows, Google offers internships that pay up to $6,000 . Rave reviews: Vince Vaughan and Owen Wilson in The Internship. Google is the highest-rated company for top intern experiences . Not only has Google topped Fortune 500's top U.S company to work for, it also has the highest-paying internships, according to Glassdoor. On average, interns are paid . $5,800 a month, although a specialized software engineer can make as much . as $6,700. Potential interns must commit to three months of full-time work, meaning most will make about $18,000 during their time at the Mountain View, California headquarters. 'Actually, it's not that surprising that . interns at a company like Google are getting paid so handsomely,' Scott Dobroski, from Glassdoor, told CNN Money. 'The . war for tech talent continues to rage on.' Microsoft and Amazon also pay interns more than $5,500 a month. In some cases, research interns at Microsoft are paid $7,000 a month, according to Glassdoor which compiles information sent in from employees and interns. The equivalent full-time salary for a Google intern is $72,000 - about $30,000 higher than the average starting salary for graduates. Figures from the National Association . of Colleges and Employers in January showed the average salary for . graduates working in their study field was $44,455.

In . addition to topping the highest paid intern list, Google also has one of the highest numbers of interns - taking 1,500 a year from nearly 40,000 applicants. It also has a reputation for an extreme interviewing process, although according to Business Insider, the company has prevented its interviewers from asking candidates questions such as 'How many cows are in Canada?' Candidates have to pass two 45-minute, highly technical phone interviews, where they can be asked to write code. Work experience: Intern Rohan Shah says Google workers are creative and active . Once accepted, they face interviews with up to five departments to determine where they will fit in best. Although interns are not allowed to discuss their time at Google afterwards, a 20-year-old University of Illinois student has offered insight into the competitive application process and life as an intern. Rohan Shah told Business Insider, . that three months and several interviews after applying for an . internship, he found himself at the Mountain View headquarters. Rohan was put up in free corporate housing, with three other interns from Argentina and Ukraine for roommates. And, with free shuttle buses, cycles to get around the headquarters and free food, the $6,000 a month pay was not wasted on basic living costs. He said after a week of being there he felt like he had worked for Google his entire life. Like . many other interns, he said the biggest perk was the endless free food . from 24 cafes offering everything from Mexican and Indian food, to salad . bars and burger joints. Rohan also caught a glimpse of Google co-founder Sergey Brin once, while he and three friends were at the on-site bowling alley.

A 36-year-old Florida man has been arrested for kidnapping a 14-year-old boy after meeting him via an online Playstation game and sending him explicit photos and text messages. Tony McLeod allegedly flew from Tampa to Escondido, California, and lured the boy to a Los Angeles airport, where the pair boarded a flight back to Tampa. Thankfully the boy's parents raised the alarm when he did not return home from school on Monday and police were on the ground in Tampa to meet the pair off the plane. Arrested: Tony McLeod, 36, flew from Florida to California then lured a 14-year-old boy back to Tampa with him after previously contacting the boy via an online PlayStation game . In the weeks prior to the kidnapping, they had begun to suspect . someone was preying on their son after finding sexually explicit . materials on his mobile phone from McLeod. The parents called McLeod's cell phone warning him to stay away from . their son and alerted police, but McLeod changed his phone number and began . to lay low, making it difficult for police to find him. The boy's parents were worried McLeod, who had initially contacted their son via an online Playstation game, was involved in his disappearance. Authorities were alerted to the boy's disappearance and police immediately gained the legal permissions required to track his cell phone. Intercepted: Due to some quick detective work, California police were able to alert their Tampa counterparts to the kidnapping and local police were at Tampa International Airport when the plane with McLeod and the boy landed . They tracked McLeod to Long Beach, California, before learning that he had boarded a non-stop flight for Tampa with the eighth grader. It's unclear exactly how McLeod lured the boy onto the six-hour-plus flight, but police say he is a 'very sophisticated predator'. 'It's mind-boggling...this person was particularly bold,' said Major Brian Dugan of the Tampa Police force. When the plane landed at 6:09am Tuesday, Tampa authorities were on the tarmac to arrest McLeod and take the boy into protection. 'I think when you go to a different state and you bring a 14-year-old boy back - and you're an adult and the cops are waiting for you on the runway...I think the gig is up,' said Dugan. McLeod is charged with kidnapping, interfering with custody, traveling to meet a minor and transmission of harmful material to a minor. 'This case originally came to our attention because of the family . monitoring the young man's phone, and even then this happened, which . just goes as a warning that you cannot monitor your children closely . enough when it comes to the internet,' an officer with Escondido .

'This kid, no one knows what was going to happen to him here in Tampa,' Dugan said. McLeod's neighbors were shocked by the news. 'He seemed like a nice guy.

A judge has ruled in favor of two interns who worked for an Oscar-winning film and filed suit against the film’s production company claiming it violated labor laws by not paying them. Judge William H. Pauley III of Manhattan Federal District Court ruled Tuesday that Alex Footman and Eric Glatt should have been paid like regular employees because they did the same work as regular employees. According to the judge, the internship on the set of Black Swan was not educational and merely served the benefit of Fox Searchlight Pictures by offering them free labor. Victory: A Federal District Court in Manhattan has ruled in favor of Alexander Footman, pictured, and Eric Glatt, who sued a production company for violating minimum wage laws with unpaid internships . The NY Times reports that about half of the one million internships worked by college undergraduates each year are unpaid, so the impact of this ruling could be broad and profound. ‘I’m absolutely thrilled,’ said Mr. Glatt told the Times. ‘I hope that this sends a very loud and clear message to employers and to students doing these internships, and to the colleges that are cooperating in creating this large pool of free labor — for most for-profit employers, this is illegal. It shouldn’t be up to the least powerful person in the arrangement to have to bring a lawsuit to stop this.’ While admitting that the two men benefited from their immersion in the entertainment industry and from potential future from an improved resume and job references, he called them ‘incidental to working in the office like any other employees and were not the result of internships intentionally structured to benefit them.’ Unfair: Eric Glatt is in his forties and has an MBA but wanted a foothold in the entertainment industry. He later came to see the way many get into the industry, through unpaid internships, as unfair and chose to sue . Footman worked full five-day weeks of up to 40 hours as a production intern on the film from October 2009 to February 2010. He was tasked with making coffee for the production team, keeping the coffee pot full, taking and distributing lunch orders, taking out the trash, cleaning the office and collecting receipts for expenses, according to the lawsuit. ‘Searchlight received the benefits of their unpaid work, which otherwise would have required paid employees,’ said the judge. Unfair? Black Swan (2011) grossed more than $300 million worldwide. The alleged Fox Searchlight pictures used unpaid interns to keep costs down and profits high, with no benefit to the the intern . A spokesman for Twentieth Century Fox told the Times, ‘We are very disappointed with the court’s rulings. We believe they are erroneous, and will seek to have them reversed.’ Black Swan cost $13 million to produce and grossed more than $300 million worldwide. The lawsuit claimed Fox Searchlight has been able to reduce its production costs 'by employing a steady stream of unpaid interns.' A lawyer for the two men said this is something they’d hoped, and believe will be, changed in the wake of the ruling. Ruling: Judge William H. Pauley III ruled that Fox Searchlight should have paid two interns on the movie because they were essentially regular employees . The lawsuit was the first of several at the time that saw unpaid interns who believed they’d been wronged by their employers fighting back. In one such suit in February of 2012, a former Hearst Magazines intern claimed she’d regularly worked in excess of 50 hours per week unpaid. Now, things could be looking up for the country’s interns. ‘Employers have already started to take a hard look at their internship programs,’ Attorney Rachel Bien said. ‘I think this decision will go far to discourage private companies from having unpaid internship programs.’ The ruling indicates that a class action suit involving other Fox interns may now move forward.","In a suit filed September 2011, Eric Glatt and Alex Footman claimed they worked as hard as paid Fox Searchlight Pictures employees and should be compensated accordingly .
Judge William H. Pauley III of a Federal District Court in Manhattan agreed and characterized the internship arrangement as largely only beneficial to the employer .

An hilarious YouTube video purporting to be a reference to support a job application for DreamWorks Pictures features 'CJ' in a convincing appeal for employment - even Steven Spielberg is apparently on his side. The video begins with a written explanation: 'In 2011, CJ applied for a job at DreamWorks. He sent in this video.' CJ wants to be a post-production production assistant at DreamWorks, and he believes he's got the chops for the job. But don't take his word for it - Steven Spielberg has a few things to say on his behalf. Living the dream: Christopher Woodring showed off his production skills by cleverly editing an old interview to make it look like he and Steven Spielberg had an intimate tete-a-tete regarding Woodring's job prospects . In a cleverly spliced old interview with Spielberg, CJ, who identifies himself as Christopher Woodring, extracts some high praise from the director, screenwriter, producer - and co-founder of DreamWorks movie studios. 'Why, hello there Steven Spielberg,' he says, glancing meaningfully at the camera. 'You look great, by the way... You haven't aged a day since 1993,' in reference to the interview footage, which appears to be an old BBC Face to Face interview from around the time of the release of Spielberg's acclaimed Schindler's List in 1993. CJ asks Spielberg if he could endorse him for a job at DreamWorks, to which Spielberg responds, 'I can. And I can without shame.' Aged well: It's unclear if Spielberg has seen the video, which uses an old BBC interview from 1993, but according to the video's conclusion, Woodring has been banned from working at DreamWorks . In response to CJ's question about his best qualities, Spielberg decides it's CJ's 'wondrous eyes', and the 'energy of Helen Hayes when she was in her 70s', referring to the American actress dubbed the First Lady of American Theater. 'That's a strange example,' say CJ. 'But yes, I have infectious energy, I'm kind of always working hard,' he concedes. When it comes to thinking of CJ's worst, Spielberg appears stumped. 'Take your time,' CJ encourages him gently. He can't come up with anything, so they move onto their friendship. Job seeker: CJ has not been successful in his bid for a job at Dreamworks so far, but the company has remained silent on whether or not Spielberg cried . 'We went out together, we went to each . other's houses together, we complain together- ' begins Spielberg. 'Mostly about George,' interjects CJ, referring to Spielberg's rival . George Lukas. 'Of course,' grins Spielberg. The . final part of the interview moves to a more emotional plane, as . Spielberg discusses his fear that CJ won't come and work at Dreamworks. 'Steven, if I don't come and work for you, will you cry?' asks CJ. 'Yes,' replies Spielberg softly, appearing to hold back deep emotion. To uplifting music, CJ appears with a glass of wine raised to the camera and text across the screen exhorts Dreamworks: . 'Hire Christopher Woodring as Post Production Assistant. Steven Spielberg will cry if you don't.' Incredibly, even after the amazing reference of Steven Spielberg and those wondrous eyes, it appears CJ has not been hired by Dreamworks. Perhaps he should put some feelers out to George Lukas.","Christopher Woodring made the hilarious video as a reference in support of a job application .

Then 18, she reported the attack but she says detectives Jerry Rittgarn and Sergeant Jeff Mason didn't believe her story, and ignored evidence including stained sheets, doctors reports detailing injuries to her wrists and abrasions on her genitals and DNA samples. She says the officers bullied her for hours, without a lawyer present, into recanting her account and, when she later tried to insist the rape did take place, she was charged $500 for false reporting.

O'Leary was convicted of five rapes, including the Lynnwood one, and is serving a 327-year sentence in a Colorado prison. Last week, D.M. filed a federal civil . rights suit against the city of Lynnwood, Rittgarn, Mason and Lynnwood . Police Chief Steven Jensen. In . it she claims the detectives ignored . her account of events and bullied her into saying the rape never . happened.

She also accuses them of threatening to . have her thrown out of her apartment, owned by an at-risk youth home . called Cocoon House, when she insisted it did take place. After the attack, she says she was forced to stand up in front of a group of teens at a Cocoon House-run program and confess that she'd lied about the rape, something which resulted in her having to see a councilor. The facility and two of its employees are also named in the lawsuit. Cocoon House CEO Cassie Franklin told the Seattle Times this week: 'Our hearts go out to D.M. and her family ... We strongly believe that Cocoon House and its employees acted appropriately on behalf of the client.' Jensen refused to comment to the newspaper because of the litigation and Rittgarn, who has since left the Lynnwood Police Department and now lives in San Diego, said he was unaware of the lawsuit and couldn't remember the case. Mason is still with the Lynnwood Police Department. The victim, who now lives in Wyoming, and her lawyer also declined to comment to the Seattle Times.","The woman, identified only as D.M., was gagged, bound and sexually assaulted in her Lynnwood, Washington, home by Marc O'Leary in 2008 .

Tragic: Sam Lee Morris, pictured, died after a group of teens pushed him into traffic on Saturday night . Police believe he made a weak attempt to fight off the culprits by swinging his grocery bag at them but got hit in the head and then pushed in front of a car. The driver of the car didn't stop, and authorities are now appealing for information on that person as well as the group of teens. Detectives are using surveillance video from the nearby Elisha Pease Elementary school and local businesses to search for clues. Fox 4 News reported they had made at least one arrest in the case. Morris' brother, Robert Morris, told the station he was shocked when he heard his brother had passed away, but wasn't surprised how it happened. He said teens regularly harass the elderly in the neighborhood and while his brother probably put up a fight, he would have been overpowered because of his age and disability. 'When that happened I'm sure he was trying to get away from him but he couldn't,' Morris, who was out of town at a funeral when the attack took place, said. Dallas News | myFOXdfw.com .

A British pensioner sentenced to death for drug smuggling by an Egyptian court on Monday claims he set up by a drug runner. Charles Ferndale, 74, is accused of attempting to smuggle three tons of the cannabis product . hashish, worth almost £3million into Egypt aboard his boat . and being part of an ‘international gang’. But Mr Ferndale insists that he thought he was helping to move a cargo of incense from Aden in Yemen to Aqaba in Jordan for an Egyptian friend who had lent him money for yacht fuel. Death row: Charles Ferndale, 74, is accused of attempting to smuggle three tons of the cannabis product hashish, worth almost £3million into Egypt . The pensioner, three men from the . Seychelles and one from Pakistan were arrested by armed police aboard a . vessel near the Red Sea coastal town of Marsa Alam in 2011. The Pakistani man is said to have fled the scene and to have been sentenced to death in absentia. Mr Ferndale gave an interview to The Daily Telegraph from his prison cell in Qena, in the desert halfway between Hurghada and Luxor. He had previously been held in Hurghada prison which he said had worse conditions. He admitted he had been a . 'fool' and made 'disastrous life decisions', but said insisted he was set up by an Egyptian friend he called 'Gamal.' A wildlife . conservationist in Pakistan, Mr Ferndale admitted he could not explain part of his life story 'because . it would get me killed'. Arrested: Charles Raymond Ferndale, a . 74-year-old British sailor is . among five people sentenced to death in Egypt for drug smuggling.  Two of the three Seychellois involved in the drug trafficking case:  Ronny Jean, left and right, Yvon Vinda . But he said he had no knowledge he was helping to transport 118  bags of cannabis product hashish. He told the newspaper he had picked up three crew . members from the Seychelles to sail to Aden in April 2011. It was there that he picked up the 'incense'  that he had agrreed to carry for Gamal - he claimed Gamal was, unbeknown to him, the . son of a prominent Egyptian drug–runner, and that he was being 'set up'. Dean Loze, the other Seychellois national convicted on charges of drug trafficking in Egypt . Mr Ferndale told the paper he was born in South Africa to a family of . antiapartheid activists. After moving to Britain to study art, he took citizenship and then in 1972 moved to Pakistan to pursue his vocation of . campaigning for wildlife - he ran a falcon sanctuary. He said he had adult children in Britain - he said he had made them take different surnames to protect them and although they knew where he was, he refused to discuss them. A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘We are opposed to the death penalty in all circumstances. Our consular team in Cairo are in contact with the British prisoner and we will do our utmost to prevent this execution.’ Ferndale, who is said to have been . living mostly in the Pakistan port city of Karachi, and those convicted . with him are expected to lodge an appeal against the sentence within the . next 28 days. Egyptian officials said yesterday . they believed the bags of hashish had originated in Pakistan although a . spokesman in the capital Islamabad said it was unaware of the case. Anti-death penalty campaigner Kim Manning Cooper, of Amnesty International UK, said: ‘This is extremely worrying news. ‘The death penalty is cruel and . unnecessary in all circumstances, but international standards clearly . stipulate that capital punishment should never be imposed in non-lethal . cases like this one. ‘We will be pressing for the sentence against Mr Ferndale and the others in this case to be commuted. ‘Executions were something we saw . almost every year in Egypt during Hosni Mubarak’s long authoritarian . rule. Egypt should immediately impose a complete moratorium on the death . penalty. Amnesty claims that 91  people were . sentenced to death in Egypt last year, although it is not thought that . anyone has been executed for two years. There have been no executions of Europeans for more than 20 years, officials in Cairo said. Arrest: The case dates back to 2011 when four of the defendants were arrested on board a ship near the Red Sea coastal town of Marsa Alam . Fine: The court in the city of Hurghada also imposed a fine of 85 million Egyptian pounds (£850,000) There is also concern over fair . trials in the country. A recent report claims that some 1,100 people . failed to get a fair trial from the Egyptian courts in the past year. In recent years, Ferndale has written . for both the British and Pakistani media on subjects including . terrorism, Al Qaeda, Osama Bin Laden, the Middle East and Afghanistan. He claims to have a degree from the Institute of Psychiatry in London and lists his occupation as charity worker. The other men convicted in Egypt were . named as Ronny Norman Jean, 41, Yvon John Vinda, 38, Dean Dominic Loze, . 27, all from the Seychelles, and Munawar Saeed Khan, 44, from Pakistan. Ferndale’s case mirrors in some ways the plight of British grandmother Lindsay Sandiford. She is in a Bali jail having been . sentenced to death – by firing squad – after being convicted of trying . to smuggle cocaine on to the holiday island in May 2012.

Runaway teacher Jeremy Forrest told a 14-year-old schoolgirl ‘I love you’, days before kissing her in his classroom, a court heard yesterday. A few weeks later, the married 30-year-old had sex with her at his cottage while his wife was away. He also researched the maximum jail sentence he could get for sleeping with his pupil, Lewes Crown Court was told. Teacher in the dock: Jeremy Forrest's 15-year-old pupil, giving evidence by videolink, described how their relationship had developed from a kiss in the classroom to sex at the cottage he shared with his wife . When he realised the affair was about . to be exposed he fled to France with his lover and spent eight days on . the run before being caught and returned to Britain, the jury heard. A filmed police interview with the schoolgirl soon after they were found last September was played to the court yesterday. In it, the teenager described how . after becoming close during a school trip to the US last February they . began exchanging frequent Twitter and text messages, which gradually . became more flirtatious. She said late in April 2012 he sent her a message on Twitter saying: ‘I’ve got something to tell you tomorrow.’ Educational establishment: In the days leading up to the kiss, the teenager said she attended Bishop Bell Church of England School (pictured) in Eastbourne, East Sussex, early - specifically to see him . The schoolgirl added: ‘I went into . school early in the morning. He just said he was in love with me. I said . the feeling is the same. That’s when things became serious.’ She described turning up early to school for four consecutive days in May until there was a time when they could be alone. Asked about their first kiss, she . said: ‘I do remember one day being in his classroom, it was just me and . him and he said, “I really want to kiss you”, and I said, “I really want . to kiss you too”, because that’s what I wanted. ‘It got to the point where there was only so much of a friendship you could have before it developed into something else. On trial: The girl was 14 at the time of the alleged kiss with 30-year-old Jeremy Forrest (pictured today outside Lewes Crown Court in East Sussex) ‘It ended up being in his classroom.’ Shortly after she turned 15, the maths teacher took her to his house in Ringmer, East Sussex, while his wife, Emily, was away. She said he showed her around the house, including the marital bedroom, before cooking her dinner. They watched TV together and spent the night side by side in the spare bedroom, but not having sex, the court heard. They continued to meet outside school . and exchange more intimate texts and photos, including one of her . dressed in just her underwear and a hooded top, the court heard. She said: ‘It got to the point where kissing each other like that, it became not enough.’ The youngster returned to Forrest’s . home in July last year, while Mrs Forrest was seeing her parents, and . this time they had sex for the first time, she said. She had told her . mother she was seeing a friend when it happened. The schoolgirl said: ‘The whole thing was pretty quick. When it came to it, I don’t think we spoke that much about it. ‘I remember after not feeling guilty . or that I had done anything wrong. We used contraception every single . time. Obviously it was a big thing for me. It should probably have been . bigger, but I was not that affected by it.’ She added that Forrest seemed nervous about having sex, but ‘after having sex for the first time there was pressure off’. They continued to have sex at his . home, in local hotels and in his Ford Fiesta and also went on day trips . to the Bluewater shopping centre near the M25 in Kent and Hastings in . East Sussex. She said ‘He wanted me to meet his parents. I think they’d seen a picture of me.’ On one occasion, she said Forrest told . her his wife had become angry after discovering the youngster’s nail . varnish at the marital home. She said Forrest had previously said he and his wife had split up. Entrance: Jeremy Forrest arrived at Lewes Crown Court today with a guard for the third day of his trial . He then told her how Mrs Forrest . reacted when she found the cosmetics, she said, adding: ‘She was angry, . because they had split up but they were still married, and that’s when . he told her he was seeing someone else. ‘The fact that he has a wife has . always been a problem for me. I was like, “Why are you with me?” You’re . meant to be in love with the person you marry.’ Pupils anger . The couple discussed their age gap and . the fact that he was a teacher, but to her it was never a major . concern, she said, adding: ‘I have never felt what me and Jeremy have . done was wrong, it feels so right. ‘I can understand why it’s wrong . because of the law but it didn’t feel wrong. To him, it wasn’t about age . and it didn’t matter to him what age I was because he just liked me as a . person. It didn’t worry me because we were in love. We still are. ‘If he was caught he could lose his . job and we would be separated from each other. It was an issue, but . something we knew in a few years wouldn’t be. ‘Because I’m 15 people think I don’t know what’s going through my head. I know my own mind, I know what I want.’ Forrest was also aware of the . consequences he faced and even looked up how long he could be jailed for . having sex with an underage pupil, she added. ‘Obviously he knew what could happen, losing his job and getting into trouble. That was just a risk he wanted to take.’ She said they would have minor rows about classmates talking to her or texting her because they thought she was single. Their secret relationship came to light after the police were tipped off and confiscated her phone, the court heard. Forrest picked up the schoolgirl the . following evening and they drove to Dover to catch a ferry, it was . alleged. She said: ‘I think he was panicking a lot, just the look on his . face. ‘He looked very anxious, very worried . and frustrated in a way because we knew we were going to be caught for . something that we didn’t think was wrong.’ On the ferry Forrest threw his phone . into the sea to prevent them being traced. They later drove to Paris . where they dumped their car before taking a train to Bordeaux where . Forrest began to relax. The schoolgirl said they did not watch . TV and had ‘no idea how big the story of their disappearance had become . in Britain’. She said: ‘It was more of a jokey thing, saying, “Will we . be on the news?”.’ But after spotting an online story . about them as he was checking football results on his local paper, he . began to panic again. ‘He said, “I’m going to go to prison. We are going . to be caught. I’m never going to see you again”,’ she said. ‘I had to reassure him a lot that everything was going to be fine. ‘He was just really worried that his family would disown him.’ Forrest was finally caught by local police after eight days on the run. Hearing: Lewes Crown Court (file picture) heard that police were alerted to the relationship after a tip-off . She said: ‘I was trying to break free . but he just stood there like it was expected. I mouthed “I love you” to . him and he mouthed it back.’ She saw him one last time as they were . driven away in separate cars from the police station after giving their . statements to French police. She said: ‘His face was just blank. He had no expression.’ Forrest denies one count of child abduction. The trial continues.

A boxer who threatened Muslims with acts of ‘insane violence’ on Facebook hours after Drummer Lee Rigby was hacked to death was jailed for four months today. Tony Perrin, 27, was arrested near his south London home after he posted his threats with a photo of himself wearing a balaclava and pointing a gun at the camera. Perrin, who used a Facebook page in the name of ‘Tony Croydon’, wrote on May 22 this year, just after the Woolwich execution: ‘I will do a lot worse than what took place yesterday and I have like minded people behind me’. In the post, Perrin encouraged his ‘fellow countrymen’ and ‘my beloved EDL’ to follow his lead. Image: Perrin had donned a balaclava and gripped an imitation weapon as he threatened Muslims with 'revenge' in a vile post put on Facebook after the death of Lee Rigby . He said: 'You Muslims aren’t the only people that make explosives and your (corr) not the only people willing to commit acts of insane violence. He concluded his message with hate with a variation on the EDL slogan, ‘Never surrender’, adding: ‘Revenge will be taken!’ The judge conceded that ‘what happened in Woolwich a few weeks ago shocked the whole nation’ but he said Perrin’s case was ‘abhorrent’. Jailing Perrin for four months Judge Clark said the aggravating factors were his ‘glorification of firearms’ and the incitement of ‘revenge attacks’. Perrin admitted that the handgun was only a BB gun and that he was drunk when he made the offensive post. He had also engaged with a Muslim online soon afterwards - a conversation which led him to take down his post. But by this time it had already gone ‘viral’ and the damage had been done. Perrin lost his job as a scaffolder as a result of the publicity surrounding the case. the court heard. Shameful: This is the grossly offensive message Perrin posted on Facebook in the 24 hours after Drummer Rigby died, which led to him being jailed today . His . previous convictions include possession of an imitation firearm with . intent to commit an indictable offence, dishonesty and attempted . robbery. But despite his support for the far . right group, it emerged at West London Magistrates Court that EDL . supporters have accused Perrin of ‘damaging the cause’. Perrin’s . solicitor told the court that he ‘has had telephone calls from members . of the EDL threatening him and telling him if he goes to prison he will . be assaulted’. The . reasons for the EDL threats are unclear but a page from the EDL news . reads: ‘As much as we are saddened by yesterday’s news from Woolwich, we . feel it is more important than ever to keep tabs on extremists on the . far right.

Getting out: Ryan Cleary, a member of the computer hacking group LulzSec, is to be released from prison despite possessing extreme child pornography . A hacker jailed for a global online rampage is to be freed within weeks despite being caught with sickening images of child abuse. The 172 images found on Ryan Cleary’s computers included a six-month-old baby being sexually tortured and six repulsive videos. More than 50 of the pictures were at level four, the second highest level of seriousness. Cleary, 21, was jailed for more than two years last month over the cyber attack on organisations including the NHS and Serious Organised Crime Agency. He was back in court yesterday to be sentenced over the child abuse images found when police investigating his hacking activities raided the home he shared with his mother in 2011. Sentencing guidelines say anyone caught with a similar amount of material could serve up to 18 months in prison. Judge Deborah Taylor admitted Cleary posed a ‘risk’ to children and ordered that he should never be alone with anyone under 16. But she said it was in the ‘public interest’ for him to serve a community order as he had already served a ‘substantial’ amount of time in custody. Because of his guilty pleas and the time served on remand or wearing an electronic tag, he will soon be released, Southwark Crown Court heard. The decision to spare Cleary a further term behind bars provoked anger from child protection campaigners. Claude Knights, director of charity Kidscape, said: ‘The making and possession of indecent images are horrendous crimes. Everything should be done to eliminate this trade. 'An important step would be to send out the strongest of messages to those that engage in it. Police probe: The detached home in Wickford, Essex, where Ryan Cleary was arrested by police in 2011 and officers found disturbing images on two computers . Decision: Judge Taylor admitted Cleary's: 'Images are such as would cause any right-minded person to be severely concerned', but still gave him a suspended sentence . ‘At a time when there are so many concerns about the dark side of the internet this sentence gives us very little reassurance.’ John Carr, an expert in combating child abuse images, said: ‘The sentencing guidelines are very clear. 'These type of images normally mean jail but it seems the courts are less and less likely to follow that advice. ‘This is another symptom of the crisis that is engulfing this area of policy because the number of offenders is so large.’ Cleary, known as ‘Viral’, was a leading member of the LulzSec hacking gang who targeted Sony and the CIA as well as the NHS and Serious Organised Crime Agency. The men dumped the personal details of hundreds of thousands of people on the internet and left a trail of destruction which cost at least £50million to fix. Last month he was jailed for two years and eight months for his role in the attacks during which the gang described themselves as ‘Gods of Cyberspace’. Yesterday Cleary, of Wickford, Essex, was ordered to serve a three-year community order, which includes a sex offenders’ treatment programme, for three charges related to child abuse images. Lulzsec members: Ryan Cleary, 21, left , and A-level student Mustafa Al-Bassam admitted their . role in bringing down websites which caused tens of millions of pounds . worth of damage . Hacking: Jake Davis, 20, from the Shetland Isles, left, and Ryan Ackroyd, right, were also involved . A sexual offences prevention order, which restricts his online access and bans him from speaking to people under 16 on the internet, was also imposed. Cleary was barred from working with children and placed on the sex offenders’ register for five years. Judge Taylor said: ‘Although the sentencing guidelines recommend an immediate custodial sentence, time has been served in any event.’ Ben Cooper, Cleary’s barrister, said he would be released ‘imminently’. Cleary had earlier admitted two counts of making and one count of producing indecent images of children. The court was told his life has been ‘blighted’ by mental health issues and self-harm and he split up with his girlfriend about six months ago. An earlier hearing heard he suffers from Asperger’s syndrome and his decision to access the material was linked to his hacking activities.","Ryan Cleary was in a team who waged an online war costing business £50m .

David Cameron will today launch a web campaign to pile pressure on Labour and the Lib Dems to drop their opposition to giving the public a say on the EU. The Prime Minister will risk coalition unity by urging voters in Lib Dem seats to bombard their MP with emails, web messages and tweets demanding they back a law on holding a referendum on Britain’s relationship with Brussels. And he will use the . Let Britain Decide to challenge Labour leader Ed Miliband and his MPs to support legislation on holding an in-out vote. Campaign: The Tory party has launched a stand-alone website which voters can use to pressure their MP into supporting an EU referendum . Speech: David Cameron used his long-awaited speech on the UK's relationship with the EU to promise an in-out referendum . The Tories have drafted a Bill committing to a referendum by the end of 2017. But the Lib Dems are opposed to the plan, and have refused to give it government time to be debated. Instead Conservative MP James Wharton will try to get it on to the statute book as a backbench Bill. But it stands no chance of becoming law with only the support of Tory MPs. Mr . Cameron has overseen the creation of a website which will allow voters . from across the country to quickly and easily fire off messages to their . local MP to demand they support the first referendum on Europe for 40 . years. It is hoped the . electronic onslaught will force Labour and Lib Dem MPs to defy their . party leaders - particularly in areas where the Tories’ pro-referendum . policy could prove deceive in a tight general election in 2015. The stand-alone campaign website at www.LetBritainDecide.com aims to ‘build public pressure, to give . people a voice, and to urge MPs from other parties to listen to their . constituents’. Pressure: Labour leader Ed Miliband faces calls from half of his shadow cabinet to drop opposition to a referendum while Lib Dem Nick Clegg admits it is only a matter of time until a vote is held . Tory party . chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘Britain deserves a vote. It’s been nearly . 40 years since the British people last had their say on Europe. People . feel the EU is heading in a direction they never signed up to. ‘That is why Conservatives want to give Britain a clear vote – in or out – before the end of 2017, after a full renegotiation. ‘A . draft Bill to make this happen will soon be debated by MPs – but, . crucially, it needs the support of other political parties to pass. Britain needs everyone to build public pressure on this.’ It . is understood the web initiative has been modelled on the 38 Degrees . campaign group, which pressured the government into banning animals from . circuses and abandoning plans to sell off forests. A . draft Bill released by the Tories poses the question: 'Do you think . that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?'. The . vote would be held before 31 December 2017, but the legislation stands . little chance of becoming law against opposition from the Lib Dems and . Labour. The Tory party has vowed to impose a . three-line whip on its MPs in an attempt to give the Bill the best . possible chance of becoming law. The stand-alone website will allow voters to send emails, tweets and Facebook messages to persuade their local MP to back a referendum . The Prime Minister has told his MPs they must scrap constituency meetings to make sure they are in Westminster for the vote on Mr Wharton's Bill. Mr Wharton said: ‘Fundamentally this is about democracy and trusting the people. ‘We must give the British people a choice on this important issue, and have an open and frank debate before that decision. ‘I hope that MPs from all sides will . back the Bill and show that they back democracy, and the right of their . constituents to decide on our future in the EU.’ Promise: Tory MP James Wharton's private members' bill would enshrine into law a a pledge to hold an in-out referendum on Europe . Half of the shadow cabinet reportedly want Mr Miliband to commit to an in-out vote ahead of the 2015 general election. They fear being portrayed as being unwilling to trust the British public. Growing . number of pro-Europeans also believe Britain could vote to leave the EU . unless they publicly back a referendum and start making the case to . stay in. The Prime Minister used a long-awaited speech in January to announce a future Tory government would seek to renegotiate a ‘fresh settlement’ with Brussels before staging an in-out referendum by the end of 2017. He promised he would campaign for Britain to stay in a reformed EU but added: ‘I say to the British people: This will be your decision.’ The dramatic pledge piled pressure on Labour and the Liberal Democrats, who argued it created uncertainty which could threaten investment in Britain. Last month the Tory party published a draft Bill legislating on holding an in-out vote before 2017. Mr Wharton topped a ballot of MPs to have the chance to take legislation through the Commons, and agreed to try to pass the EU Bill. However, both the Lib Dems and Labour have remained opposed to it. Mr Clegg, however, standing in for Mr Cameron at Prime Minister's Questions, surprised MPs when he said it was a question of 'when, not if' to hold an in/out referendum. And a Labour for a Referendum campaign has been launched, with the backing of more than 150 councillors and MPs, demanding Mr Miliband drop his opposition to giving the public a say. Millionaire Labour donor John Mills said: ‘I think the Labour Party would be unwise to rule out having a referendum before the run-up to the next general election. A lot can happen over the next two years.’","David Cameron orders online campaign against opponents of a referendum .

In the dock: Detective sergeant Peter Yeates was jailed at Portsmouth Crown Court after stealing at least £10,000 of mobile phones and electronic equipment . A policeman and uncle of murdered landscape architect Joanna Yeates stole gadgets worth thousands of pounds because her death left his life in ‘turmoil’, a judge heard yesterday. Detective Sergeant Peter Yeates admitted taking digital cameras and smartphones from police stations before selling them on the internet. The officer, who had been commended six times while working for a specialist crime unit, stole the confiscated stolen goods and lost property from storerooms. Portsmouth Crown Court heard yesterday that Yeates, 51, changed from being the ‘perfect policeman’ after the breakdown of his marriage and the murder of Joanna, who was also his goddaughter. Miss Yeates, 25, was killed by Dutch neighbour Vincent Tabak, who was jailed for life in 2011 after admitting strangling her. During police interviews, Yeates said her death affected him ‘significantly’. He had a breakdown in August 2011 and took several weeks off work to recover. Ian Lawrie QC, defending, said: ‘The tragedy of what happened to his goddaughter is one of a number of features over two and a half years where there were domestic issues. 'You can see the stark contrast between the man who was a perfect policeman for 20 years and the dramatic fall from grace. His sense of shame is considerable.’ Yeates, who was one of two officers with access to Dorset Police’s property store, sold 461 mobile phones to an online recycling firm from January 2009 to March last year, making more than £10,600. He took the items saying they were needed as props by the force’s major crime unit during operations. But investigators found he put 17 phones up for sale on the internet on the day 22 were taken from a store at Weymouth police station. Three digital cameras sold by Yeates on eBay came from the property store. Murder: The killing of Joanna Yeates by her neighbour Vincent Tabak shocked the country, and her uncle Peter said that and his marriage break-up left his life in turmoil . Well-spoken Yeates, who grew up in . colonial Rhodesia and was known by colleagues as ‘Posh Pete’ and ‘Yuppie . Yeates’, was arrested just three weeks from retirement in October last . year. He was charged days after retiring, . which meant he was able to keep his full pension, estimated to be worth . around £30,000 a year. He later admitted four counts of theft totalling £5,000. Judge Ian Pearson said: ‘It is a sad . day indeed when an officer of your standing appears before this court on . multiple offences of dishonesty. 'I take into account that during this . period of offending you were experiencing difficulties in your personal . life and that halfway through this time you had to deal with the tragic . murder of your niece. ‘Any offence carried out by a serving police officer causes damage to the faith the public have in our police forces.’ Yeates was jailed for 34 weeks, ordered to pay £500 costs, and told to return £8,000. More than 8,000 crimes take place . inside police stations each year, including the theft of police cars, . uniforms and even handcuffs.","Detective Sergeant Peter Yeates took electronics for 'operational reasons'

"By . Becky Barrow . PUBLISHED: . 04:41 EST, 12 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:14 EST, 12 June 2013 . More than a million  over-65s are still working –  double the number 20 years ago, official figures revealed yesterday. Many stay in employment beyond the retirement age because they need the income,  while others enjoy their job too much to quit. The figures, from the Office for National Statistics, show 1.03million people who are over state pension age are working – nearly one in ten. In 1992, the first year the ONS kept records, only 479,000 worked. Rise: In the last two decades the number of over-65s in work has risen sharply from around 430,000 to more than 1million today . Row: David Cameron and Ed Miliband clashed in the Commons today over the unemployment figures, with the Labour leader (right) warning that living standards are falling . Experts predict the number will continue to rise. Life expectancy has increased dramatically in the past 40 years, allowing workers to delay their retirement. Meanwhile pension values have plummeted and savings rates have hit rock bottom, meaning many cannot afford to retire. Others want to continue earning to help out their grown-up children. And many older workers insist they enjoy the social interaction, challenge, mental stimulation and sense of achievement that they get from their job. Joanne Segars, chief executive of the National Association of Pension Funds, said: ‘We are seeing big changes in the age profile of the typical workplace, and the process is far from over. ‘Workers are becoming more flexible about their retirement and the UK is moving away from a black-and-white model of being either a worker or a pensioner. ‘People are choosing to stay on at work for a few more years, or are working part-time. Unfortunately, many of these older workers would rather retire but find that they do not have the savings or pension to do so. ‘Uncertainty about the economy and historically low annuity rates are also prompting many of them to stay on the payroll for a bit longer.’ The trend is also fuelled by a change in the law allowing workers to stay in their jobs for as long as they want and not being forced out at 65, and the increase in the state pension age – to 66 for both men and women by 2020 – with further increases to follow. Bumpy: The uncertain recovery continues with a small increase in the unemployment rate to 71.6 per cent, still down on the 73 per cent peak five years ago . Benefits: Dole claimants fell last month but the numbers are still much higher than the levels seen before the financial crash and subsequent recession . Dot Gibson, of the National . Pensioners’ Convention, said: ‘This is just the latest evidence that . older people are struggling to manage on their pensions and are often . forced to carry on working as the only way to make ends meet. The unemployment rate varies from 6.2 per cent in the South West of England to 10.1 per cent in the North East, the ONS said. North East 131,000 unemployed (+4,000) unemployment rate 10.1% . North West 273,000 (-28,000) 7.9% . Yorkshire and the Humber 244,000 (-2,000) 8.9% . East Midlands 179,000 (+1,000) 7.8% . West Midlands 259,000 (+19,000) 9.4% . East of England 208,000 (+1,000) 6.7% . London 366,000 (+1,000) 8.5% . South East 297,000 (-2,000) 6.6% . South West 168,000 (+12,000) 6.2% . Wales 125,000 (-) 8.4% . Scotland 194,000 (-6,000) 7.1% . Northern Ireland 68,000 (-5,000) 7.8% . ‘But the answer isn’t to keep people . working when young people are struggling to find jobs.’ Malcolm McLean, . of pensions advisers Barnett Waddingham, said the knock-on effect of the . growing number of older workers was ‘a matter of great concern’. He warned: ‘Unless or until economic . stimulus can provide many more jobs, today’s unemployed may well become . the impoverished pensioners of the future.’ The ONS figures also showed UK . unemployment fell by 5,000 between February and April to 2.51million, . and there are a record number in work – 29.7million. The percentage of the working-age . population in employment is 71.5 per cent, compared with 50 per cent in . Greece and 54 per cent in Spain. Of the 432,000 extra jobs created in . the past year, nearly two-thirds have gone to women, who make up nearly . half the workforce – 13.8million. The continuing financial squeeze . means the number of stay-at-home mothers has dropped again, by 34,000 . between February and April. Job vacancies are the highest since the 2008 banking crisis, at 516,000. But Mark Beatson, chief economist at . the Chartered Instituted of Personnel and Development, said businesses . were struggling to find people with the right skills. The number of private sector jobs has risen sharply since a low of 22.5million after the 2008 financial crash .

A fire chief who swapped explicit pornographic pictures of children online is still entitled to a £150,000 pension payout. William Wyllie, 49, was suspended from his £46,900 job as a manager by Cumbria Fire Service after his arrest in October 2011. The married father had been leading a bizarre double life, swapping indecent images of children and cruising gay dating websites. Disgraced: Fire chief William Wyllie, 49, is set to receive a £150,000 pension payout . He protested his innocence, which . meant he could legally claim his full pay throughout his suspension, and . even received a pay increase when he was promoted. However, he dramatically went on to admit six child porn charges and was given a three-year community order. Lancaster Crown Court heard that . Wyllie, of Barrow, sent indecent images of children to London-based . prolific HIV-positive paedophile Steven King, who was jailed in 2011 for . four years for arranging to have sex with children as young as five. As a result of the King investigation, Wyllie’s home and car were searched and laptops, mobile phones and sim cards were seized. He initially denied nine charges relating to distributing and encouraging the making of indecent images of children.

He was sentenced to a three-year . community order, which will involve three years’ supervision and a sex . offender treatment programme. He was also put on the sex offenders’ register for five years and subject to a sexual offences prevention . order for the same period. Wyllie started working for Cumbria .

Fire service sources blasted Wyllie’s entitlement, labelling him a ‘crafty, evil man’ and said he didn’t deserve the money. TaxPayers’ Alliance chief executive Matthew Sinclair said: 'The news of his £150,000 pay-off just adds insult to injury. 'It is this kind of eye-watering golden goodbye that is unjustifiable in normal circumstances.

A former minister has warned that high-stakes casino-style gambling machines in betting shops cause violence which can spill out into the high street. Stephen Timms said the fixed odds betting terminals (FOBTs) – branded the crack cocaine of gambling – were so addictive that users were often sent into a fury if they did not win. He said one betting chain had been forced to upgrade the reinforcement of its machines because they had been damaged so often by angry users. And he claimed the violence and abuse they cause inside betting shops is being continued out on to the street. Risky: A Labour MP says high-stakes casino-style gambling machines in betting shops can cause street brawls. File picture . The former Treasury Minister was giving evidence at Thames Magistrates’ Court where bookmaker Paddy Power is challenging a decision to block a licence for a new shop in Newham, East London. Newham Council states that betting shops fuel violent crime, street drinking and underage gambling. It claims that bookmakers are  targeting poorer areas such as Newham with the roulette-style FOBTs, which can take stakes of up to £100 a spin every 20 seconds. Newark already has 81 betting shops, with 18 on one road alone. Mr Timms, the Labour MP for East Ham, said: ‘The proliferation of these shops and these very addictive  terminals within them is destroying people’s lives. We are seeing families broken up and houses repossessed. Stephen Timms says one betting chain was forced to reinforce the betting machine as punters were lashing out at them in anger . ‘What happens is that people who lose money in these shops become very angry. I’m told Paddy Power has had to upgrade the robustness of the machines because people so often try to bash them up. And that is what often spills out on to the high street.’ Mr Timms, now shadow minister of state for employment, added: ‘Betting shops attract anti-social behaviour, including street drinking. ‘Some people tell me they walk a considerable distance to avoid it. It’s intimidating and stops people using the high street for what it is meant to be used for: shopping.’ Mr Timms was a member of the Labour government that brought in the 2005 Gambling Act which many claim has led to the proliferation of the casino-style machines. However, he claimed the technology behind the machines has developed quicker than ministers at the time could have expected. He said: ‘As a Treasury Minister I formed the view there was quite a sense of responsibility within the betting industry. Now it seems to have been entirely lost since the proliferation of these machines.’Newham Council initially wanted to make this licensing decision a test case that could halt the tide of FOBTs taking over the high street. It had employed a private detective to compile evidence from inside betting shops in the borough on the use of the machines. The report found up to 82 per cent of customers in Newham betting shops used FOBTs. But District Judge Paul Goldspring has declined to hear the evidence, claiming the machines were the primary source of profit for any future betting shop.","Labour's Stephen Timms says the gambling machines can lead to violence .

Brutal attack: Steven Frogg has been jailed for 16 years after attempting to kill a four-year-old because he thought he 'turned into a demon' An unemployed drunk who tried to murder a four-year-old boy in a frenzied knife attack because he thought the child 'turned into a demon' has been jailed for 16 years today. The victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was found in a pool of blood after he was stabbed multiple times on Easter Monday, in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, last year. Police found Steven Frogg, 52, drunk and watching children's . television in his flat wearing blood-stained clothes and with the blade . and handle of a large kitchen knife lying nearby. Neighbours had alerted police and paramedics after they spotted the wounded boy in the street. He underwent emergency surgery for knife wounds to his head, neck, shoulder and both sides of his lower torso. The victim has made a good recovery but remains haunted by 'nightmares' about the attack. Frogg admitted attempted murder at Nottingham Crown Court. He claimed he picked up the knife to protect himself after the boy had appeared to him to have taken the form of a demon. The court heard the boy's father had left him with Frogg, while he went to a corner shop to buy food for their lunch. When the father last saw his son he was happily playing with kittens Frogg had at his home. The boy's parents are separated and he had been due to return to his mother on the day he was stabbed after spending a week with his father. The father had moved to his new home seven weeks before the attack and had befriended several of his neighbours, including Frogg. John Lloyd-Jones, prosecuting, told the court: 'The boy's father had left his son in the care of the defendant playing with kittens while he went shopping.' The prosecutor said the attack was an 'abuse of trust' by the defendant. Mr Lloyd-Jones added: 'The boy has made a very good recovery physically but mentally doesn't forget this incident and still has nightmares.' Nicholas Dean, defending, said of Frogg: 'He was a man who was previously inoffensive, gentle and reclusive who suddenly behaved in a bizarre and most frightening manner that is clearly in need ofexplanation. He claims that the boy had turned into a demon. 'He is a man of previous good character. He is someone who is genuinely puzzled by what he did.' Case: Nottingham Crown Court (pictured) heard that the boy victim managed to recover but still has nightmares about his terrible ordeal . Speaking at the time of the attack the victim's father told how he had left his animal-loving son, who he described as 'bright and sprightly', at Frogg's house playing with kittens while he went to buy tinned ravioli and bread for lunch. 'I had only been gone ten minutes. As I was walking home police cars and an ambulance came rushing down the street. I thought ""crikey, someone's in serious trouble"",' he said. 'A neighbour came up to me and told me something had happened to my boy and he had already been taken to hospital.' Passing sentence Judge Michael Stokes, QC, described the boy as 'lovely'. 'This was a child of four, bleeding as he was, screaming as he was, and you shut the door on him. Ten minutes later you called 999 claiming you had been attacked. 'The effects have been devastating, leaving markedly visible scars not to mention serious psychological damage. He is frightened of stairs, he sleepwalks, he suffers dreadful nightmares, all because of you.' Detective Sergeant Phil Sims said after: 'This was a frenzied and unthinkable attack on a very young child who thought he was safe in Frogg's care. 'Frogg not only inflicted a series of horrific injuries on the boy, but also left him for dead on the pavement right outside his flat. 'Thankfully the boy survived the attack and has since recovered but he carries scars both physically and psychologically. He is young and so I hope he has little memory of the events of that day, but I have no doubt his family, those members of the public who went to his aid, and the paramedics and police officers who attended the scene, will struggle to forget what they were faced with that day.'","Steven Frogg, 52, hacked at the victim before dumping him in the street .

Mark Golds has been found guilty of murdering his girlfriend Claire Parrish after he flew into a jealous rage when she tried to end their relationship . A killer who begged police to allow him to 'finish off' his victim after being arrested midway through a knife attack on his girlfriend has been found guilty of murder. Mark Golds, 46, flew into a jealous rage when his 37-year-old partner Claire Parrish attempted to end their relationship last July due to his 'violent and controlling nature'. The former nightclub bouncer grabbed a knife and inflicted multiple injuries on his partner at the couple’s home in Harlow, Essex. Golds was unanimously found guilty of murder by a jury at Chelmsford Crown Court yesterday. He was jailed for life today and told he must serve at least 15 years behind bars before he is considered for parole. Police rushed to the scene on the evening of July 15, 2012, and spent 10 minutes battling to arrest the powerful shaven-headed killer. PC Douglas Lyall told Chelmsford Crown Court that during the scuffle Golds said: 'Let me finish her off. The bread knife’s still in the room.' Ms Parrish, a mother of four, was immediately rushed to nearby Princess Alexandra Hospital where she died of blunt force trauma injuries to her abdomen. Her family have been left devastated by her tragic death and described Golds as a 'monster' in a statement read out following the guilty verdict. It said: 'Claire was a wonderful young woman. She was the best daughter you could hope for; an amazing mum and nanny who doted on her grandson. 'Mark Golds has not only taken a daughter, he has taken a loving sister, aunt, mum and nanny. 'Claire should have had so many years to watch her young family grow up, but they were brutally taken from her; leaving a family shattered and one which will never recover. 'These 10 months have been sheer hell. 'This monster has not only murdered Claire, but he has destroyed her family. One evil act, so many ruined lives.' Golds was unanimously found guilty of murder by a jury at Chelmsford Crown Court yesterday. He was due to be sentenced today . Senior Investigating Officer, DCI Stuart Hooper, said: 'Mark Golds is a controlling individual who verbally and physically abused Claire, controlling her over a long period of time until she could take no more. 'As a manipulative individual, he . could not face up to the misery he had caused her over the years despite . her being a loving partner and mother. 'She . had never once contacted the police to report his violent behaviour and . so, sadly, we never knew of her tormented life and so could not have . stopped her suffering. 'This monster has not only murdered Claire, but he has destroyed her family. One evil act, so many ruined lives' - Family of Claire Parrish . 'We only hope that those people, men or women, who are entwined in cruel and unhappy relationships with their partners have the courage to contact us and allow us to help them get out of such terrible times. 'In their bedroom that summer’s evening, Mark Golds turned on Claire in a ferocious and sustained attack which you would not want to imagine. 'He has shown no remorse ever since.' Today Judge Christopher Ball QC jailed Golds for life and ruled that he must not even be considered for parole until he has spent 15 years in jail. As he passed sentence Judge Ball told Golds: 'I have to make a judgement on when you attacked her whether you intended to kill her. I am satisfied that was your intention although you were suffering from illness. 'It was a combination of anger, temper, frustration and illness and you resolved to kill her and achieved that purpose.' Golds sat with his eyes closed in the dock dressed in black as sentence was passed. The judge continued : 'Claire Parrish died on July 15 last year at your hands - as a violence erupted in the home you shared with her. 'You brought on her much force and violence - a knife, fists and feet were used and she received multiple injuries from one of which she died. 'It's quite plain on the day in question you were unwell. You had been receiving treatment for many years for this personality disorder and yet in the weeks before this ceased your medication creating a risk of a mental disturbance being increased. 'You went to a family party - a situation you were plainly uncomfortable with and she enjoyed. The tension there led to the development of tension and a degree of volatility which resulted in her killing. 'You became involved in an argument - she didn't want to go home and you did - and tension escalated.' The judge said Golds was told by Ms Parrish that she was 'adamant' he had to go and an argument and violence developed. 'You took a knife from the kitchen with intent to harm her and assaulted her, cutting and stabbing her many times,' said the judge.","Mark Golds killed his girlfriend after she tried to end their relationship .

A Chinese spacecraft has blasted off today on a 15-day mission to an experimental space lab in the latest step towards the development of a space station. The Shenzhou 10 spacecraft was launched from a remote site in the Gobi desert in China's far west at 5.38pm (9.38am) under warm, clear blue skies, in images carried live on state television. Once in orbit, the craft will dock with the Tiangong (Heavenly Palace) 1, a trial space laboratory module, and the two male and one female astronauts will carry out various experiments and test the module's systems. Scroll down for video . The Long March 2F rocket carrying the Shenzhou 10 capsule blasts off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in Jiuquan, in north-west China's Gansu Province . The spectacle was accompanied by the usual outpouring of national pride and Communist Party propaganda, including children dressed as happy ethnic minorities waving off the three at the space centre . They will also give a lecture to students back on Earth. China successfully carried out its first manned docking exercise with Tiangong 1 last June, a milestone in an effort to acquire the technological and logistical skills to run a full space station that can house people for long periods. President Xi Jinping oversaw the launch personally, addressing the astronauts before they blasted off to wish them success, saying he was 'enormously happy' to be there. 'You are the pride of the Chinese people, and this mission is both glorious and sacred,' Xi said, according to state media. This mission will be the longest time Chinese astronauts have spent in space, and marks the second mission for lead astronaut Nie Haisheng. It is China's fifth manned space mission since 2003, and was accompanied by the usual outpouring of national pride and Communist Party propaganda, including children dressed as happy ethnic minorities waving off the three at the space centre. The Shenzhou 10 capsule carrying three astronauts lifted off on a 15-day mission to dock with a space lab and to educate young people about science . This mission will be the longest time Chinese astronauts have spent in space, and marks the second mission for lead astronaut Nie Haisheng . The Shenzhou 10 mission will be the latest show of China's growing prowess in space . However, some wondered why China was spending so much money exploring space when it was still a developing country with a plethora of more pressing issues, from food safety and pollution to the prevalence of workplace fire disasters. 'Why don't they spend this money solving China's real problems instead of wasting it like this?' wrote one user on China's popular Twitter-like service, Sina Weibo. China's space programme has come a long way since late leader Mao Zedong, founder of Communist China in 1949, lamented that the country could not even launch a potato into space. The three astronauts of the Shenzhou-10 manned spacecraft mission, Nie Haisheng (C), Zhang Xiaoguang (R) and Wang Yaping before blast off . But China is still far from catching up with the established space superpowers, the United States and Russia. Rendezvous and docking techniques such as those which China is only testing now were mastered by the United States and the former Soviet Union decades ago, and the 10.5 metre-long Tiangong 1 is a trial module, not a fully fledged space station. Still, the Shenzhou 10 mission will be the latest show of China's growing prowess in space and comes while budget restraints and shifting priorities have held back U.S. manned space launches. China also plans an unmanned moon landing and deployment of a moon rover. Scientists have raised the possibility of sending a man to the moon, but not before 2020. While Beijing insists its space programme is for peaceful purposes, a Pentagon report last month highlighted China's increasing space capabilities and said Beijing was pursuing a variety of activities aimed at preventing its adversaries from using space-based assets during a crisis. Fears of a space arms race with the United States and other powers mounted after China blew up one of its own weather satellites with a ground-based missile in January 2007.","It is China's fifth manned space mission since 2003 .

Downing Street said David Cameron had not yet booked a plane ticket for Qatada after the deal was sealed to allay fears that evidence extracted through torture will be used against the terror suspect at a retrial. Last month, Qatada unexpectedly volunteered to leave the country as soon as the treaty between the UK and Jordan is ratified by both countries. The deportation of radical Islamist cleric Abu Qatada took a step closer after the Jordanian government agreed a treaty with the UK . Home Secretary Theresa May announced in April that she had thrashed out a mutual assistance treaty with Jordan, guaranteeing Qatada the right to a fair trial. Human rights judges in Britain and Strasbourg had halted his removal to Jordan on the grounds some of the evidence used against him may have been obtained by torture. The agreement has now been approved by both houses of the Jordanian parliament but must still be signed off by the country's King Abdullah. The UK Government expects the treaty to be ratified in Britain by June 21. It does not name Qatada directly, but it states that any evidence used to prosecute someone who is to be deported cannot be used 'unless the prosecution in the receiving State proves beyond any doubt that the statement has been provided out of free-will and choice and was not obtained by torture or ill-treatment by the authorities of the receiving State'. Home Secretary Theresa May has pinned her hopes on the treaty to finally end the decade-long saga of government attempts to oust him . September 16 1993 - The Jordanian father of five claims asylum when he arrives in Britain on a forged passport. May 1998 - He applies for indefinite leave to remain in Britain. April 1999 - He is convicted in his absence on terror charges in Jordan and sentenced to life imprisonment. February 2001 . - He is arrested by anti-terror police over involvement in a plot to . bomb Strasbourg Christmas market. Officers find him in possession of . £170,000 in cash, including £805 in an envelope marked 'For the . mujahedin in Chechnya'. August 2005 - The preacher is arrested under immigration rules as the Government seeks to deport him to Jordan. April 2008 . - The Court of Appeal rules that deporting him would breach his human . rights because evidence used against him in Jordan may have been . obtained through torture. February 18 2009 . - In a landmark judgment, five Law Lords unanimously back the . Government's policy of removing terror suspects from Britain on the . basis of assurances from foreign governments. It is ruled he can be . deported to Jordan to face terror charges.April 18 2012 - Abu Qatada lodges an appeal - potentially delaying his deportation by months. March . 6 2013 - He is returned to jail over fears the terror suspect was . trying to communicate with associates, in breach of bail conditions. March 27 2013 . - Court of Appeal admits hate preacher is 'very dangerous' but rules . sending him to face a terror trial in Jordan would not be fair.April 17 2013 - Home Office says it will take its battle to the Supreme Court. April 23 2013 - Court of Appeal rejects government request to appeal. Asked whether Mr . Cameron had booked Qatada's plane ticket to Jordan, a Downing Street . spokesman said: 'Obviously the announcement . from Jordan today is good news but from our perspective the case is . still on-going and the Prime Minister is clear in his determination to . put Abu Qatada back on a plane to Jordan.' Ministers have been trying for a decade to send Qatada to Jordan, where he is accused of plotting a terrorist atrocity to coincide with the Millennium. His removal was originally approved by the British courts, only to be halted by the European Court of Human Rights last year. Judges in Strasbourg said he would not get a fair trial because some of the evidence used against him may have been obtained by torture. Controversially, Mrs May opted not to appeal against this verdict. Instead, she and her ministers secured personal promises from the Jordanian authorities there would be no use of torture evidence, and began the deportation process again in the UK legal system. But last November, the Special Immigration Appeals Commission said it was not satisfied with the assurances, and halted Qatada’s removal. The court said it must reflect the Strasbourg ruling. That decision was upheld by the Appeal Court and the same court refused permission for the Home Secretary to challenge the ruling in the Supreme Court. However the treaty with Jordan is seen as a major breakthrough in finally ending the logn and expensive saga. A Home Office spokesman said: 'The Government remains committed to securing Qatada's deportation as quickly as possible. 'We are pleased the Jordanian parliament has approved the treaty and we await its full ratification by the Jordanian government and the completion of ratification procedures in the UK.' Qatada is currently behind bars in London's Belmarsh prison after breaching a bail condition which restricts use of mobile phones and other communication devices. The Special Immigration Appeals Commission (Siac) previously heard that a USB stick understood to belong to Qatada's oldest son contained 'jihadist files' made by the ''media wing of al Qaida'. Qatada is also being investigated by Scotland Yard over suspected extremist material found during the search of his home. The Metropolitan Police passed on the material to Danish authorities to reportedly investigate a connection with a controversial Islamic publisher.","Jordanian parliament approves mutual assistance treaty .

Unhappy: School governor Gary Lynn has resigned and pulled both his children out of school after his 10-year-old Jacob was refused lunch over a 90p debt . Like many other schoolchildren, 10-year-old Jacob Lynn was looking forward to his school lunch. The hungry youngster was eyeing up chicken nuggets and chips after a tough morning in class. But after placing his order, the student was refused a meal by dinner ladies because it would have put his lunch . money account 90p in debt. Instead, Jacob burst into tears in front of his fellow pupils and was told to go to the playground. His father Gary has now resigned as school governor and . pulled both his children out of school. The 42-year-old is furious the school did not inform him of the shortfall and let his son go hungry 'like a scene from Oliver Twist'. Mr Lynn, a leisure industry manager, said: 'I couldn’t believe it, it is like going back to a Charles Dickens 19th century period novel the way he has been refused his dinner. 'To treat a young boy like that is just unforgivable, I would have expected to be contacted and would have paid the debt off. 'My wife and I both work full time and sometimes you just forget. For this to be taken out on my son when it is my fault is mad. 'The school meal is the highlight of most children’s day but for him to be left in tears is ridiculous, it is like neglect as he was in their care.' His son, Jacob, added: 'I was quite upset by the whole thing. 'It is a small thing to stop me having lunch, all I wanted to get was chicken nuggets and chips but they wouldn’t let me.' Angry: Mr Lynn claimed his son, Jacob, was in tears after he was refused the meal. The Hayes School in Paignton, Devon, is pictured . Canteen lunches at Hayes Primary School in Paignton, Devon, are funded through an online account system. Jacob shares a family account with his brother Harrison, eight, who also attends the school but normally takes packed lunches. When the incident happened last Friday, the account had just 80p in it - 90p short of the £1.70 required for a meal. Jacob fled the canteen in tears and was later given an apple by a dinner lady who felt sorry for him. Mr Lynn, of Paignton, said: 'He burst into tears in front of everybody and was told to go to the playground. Standing firm: The school has said the kitchen staff were abiding by the rules . 'A couple of minutes later a meal time assistant came out and gave him an apple because she felt sorry for him. 'I . was enraged, I went and spoke to the head teacher and said I would . settle any account, but it had transpired that if he had eaten on that . day the account would have only been into the red by 90p. 'The . head got back to me with an e-mail on Monday morning and said there was . a policy that if the child was in the red he would be denied a meal. 'I want this so called policy removed so that this cannot happen to any other children. 'It is not a policy that is written down, I tried to look for it on the school website but I can’t find it. 'My . wife was horrified by the whole thing too, we are both providing for . our family and when something like this happens it is ridiculous.' Mr Lynn and his wife Natalie, an NVQ assessor, have now removed both children from the school. Jacob will be home schooled until he begins at Churston Ferrers Grammar School in nearby Galmpton in September. Harrison is due to transfer Brixham Primary School next week. Mr Lynn has not received an apology and has now resigned as a governor after five years. He said: 'We all forget things and I hold my hands up. I don’t expect him to be fed for free but I expect to be told so I can clear my arrears. 'They are making the child suffer at the adults incompetence of not paying the bill. Common sense should have prevailed.' In an internal response, Sean Hindle, business manager at the academy status school said: 'The kitchen staff were abiding by the rules. 'They normally phone parents to let them know that their account doesn’t have any money, and that their child won’t get a lunch that day unless the account is credited.'

Support for the UK Independence Party has dropped sharply in the wake of its surprise local elections success. A new opinion poll today showed 12 per cent of people said they were backing Nigel Farage’s party, down from an 18 per cent spike last month. It suggests the party’s popularity is closely aligned to the media exposure it received in the run-up to council elections which saw it gain 139 seats. Dip: There has been a sharp drop in support for UKIP since the record peak of 18 per cent in May . The surge in support for the anti-EU party spooked the Tory party and forced David Cameron to rush forward plans to try to legislate to hold an in-out referendum on Britain’s relationship with Brussels. Today the Tory party launched an online campaign to get voters to pile pressure on Lib Dem and Labour MPs to back a backbench Bill which would guarantee a referendum before 2017. In the latest ICM/Guardian poll, support for Labour stood at 36 per cent, up two points on May. The Tories were up one point on 29 per cent and the Lib Dems up one on 12 per cent, suggesting all the main parties have gained from a six point drop in support for UKIP. It means Mr Farage’s party is still neck and neck with Nick Clegg’s Lib Dems, who have seen their support slump since joining the coalition. Battle: UKIP leader Nigel Farage has boasted his party is taking support from all the main parties, while David Cameron has launched an online campaign to hammer home the Tory promise to hold a referendum on Britain's relationship with Brussels . Tory rebel MP Andrew Bridgen accused Mr Cameron of pursuing policies which boost UKIP's support. 'By pressing ahead with gay marriage and delaying a promise on an EU referendum until he was forced to do so, Mr Cameron has fuelled the rise of UKIP,' he said at the weekend. 'We have created our own nemesis.' However voters still rate Mr Cameron and George Osborne more highly than Labour to run the economy, the poll found. When voters were asked to put aside party preference and concentrate on who could manage the economy properly, 35 per cent named the Prime Minister and Chancellor, while only 24 per cent chose Ed Miliband and Ed Balls. Less than half of those questioned said they believed Mr Cameron had the backing of his party following months of infighting, compared to 62 per cent at the end of last year. The Guardian said that ICM Research interviewed a random sample of 1,002 adults by phone between June 7 and 9.","UKIP poll rating falls from 18% to 12% in just a month .

With millions of tracks available to download in seconds, many feared digital music would kill the compilation album. But after a decade of decline, it is making a comeback. Compilations, typically a mix of chart hits covering all genres of music, now account for 21 per cent of all albums sold. Figures from the Official Charts Company show sales of compilation albums jumped 7.2 per cent in 2012 to 20.6million, compared to 19.2million in 2011. It reverses a trend which saw compilation sales decline after 2004, when iTunes was launched in the UK. The . albums are becoming increasingly popular in the digital downloads . market. The most popular include the Now That’s What I Call Music . series. Last week, the . second most popular compilation album was Eddie Stobart – Trucking . Songs, which includes hits from Queen, Meatloaf and ZZ Top. It is expected to reach the number one spot this week. Last year, 26 titles sold more than 100,000 copies, up from 18 the year before. Other popular releases include dance compilations – which made up 25 percent of all those sold – as well as more eclectic one-off compilations such as the Olympics opening ceremony album, Isles Of Wonder. Paul Williams, Head of Business Analysis . at Music Week, said: ‘Some predicted digital music stores like iTunes, . where millions of individual tracks are available, would kill the . compilation because fans could now create their own collections of hits. 'A revival in compilation sales shows the exact opposite has occurred. ‘However, . in the download market’s early years, demand did fall dramatically and . this could be because compilations are often bought by more casual music . fans who are also slower to adopt new formats and technologies. Sales have jumped after casual music buyers who are faithful to compilation albums switched from shops to digital . These same fans are finally going digital, but still need a ‘trusted guide’ of a compilation album to know what to buy rather than getting lost among the millions of track choices. Geoff Taylor of the British Phonographic Industry added: ‘Despite the availability of tracks as individual downloads, compilations – led by the Now series – are confounding expectations and performing better than ever. ‘Not only are music fans getting superb value from double and triple album titles brimming with hits, but a string of newly-themed albums have established themselves over the last year.’","Official Charts Company figures show compilation sales jumped 7.2% in 2012 .

Pakistan has threatened to ban Google from the country over an ongoing row about 'blasphemous' content on YouTube. The new Minister for IT and Telecommunications Anusha Rahman said unless YouTube, which is owned by Google, complies in removing clips that are deemed anti-Islamic it will block access to the search engine. The video sharing website has been banned in Pakistan for nine months after bosses at the internet giant refused to remove a trailer for low-budget film The Innocence of Muslims. IT Minister Anusha Rahman said it wants Google to set restrictions on YouTube before Pakistan unblocks YouTube which was banned after worldwide protests against anti-Islamic film that was uploaded on website . The controversial American-made film sparked worldwide protests last year amid fury at the portrayal of the Prophet Muhammad.

Colin Smith put on the fancy dress outfit, including a multi-coloured wig and red nose, and claimed to be collecting money in aid of cystic fibrosis victims. But when a landlord grew suspicious of the clown's 'scruffy' outfit, he called the police - and it soon emerged that Smith could not even remember which charity he was supposed to be collecting for. The fraudster has now been sentenced to a 12-month community order at Bury Magistrates' Court, and will have to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work. Busted: Colin Smith was arrested while claiming to collect money for charity dressed as a clown . Smith, 52, travelled 40 miles from his home in Liverpool last month to the Roebuck Hotel in Rochdale, where he asked landlord Anthony Dearden if he could carry out a collection in the bar for cystic fibrosis. Mr Dearden agreed, but when he asked the man for photographic identification Smith was only able to produce a handwritten Red Nose Day form. The landlord asked Smith to leave, and radioed town centre security warning other business owners to be careful of the bogus charity worker. Mr Dearden told magistrates: 'A gentleman came through the door dressed as a clown carrying a bucket. 'I asked him what he was collecting for, and he said cystic fibrosis. He was dressed as a clown, but he looked really scruffy. 'He didn't seem to me like he was doing it with any enthusiasm, like he meant it. He didn't look like somebody who wanted to be collecting for charity.' Punishment: The serial fraudster was handed a community order and sentenced to unpaid work . Police arrested Smith in the Rochdale town centre, and in a subsequent interview he insisted he never said he was collecting for cystic fibrosis and was in fact seeking donations for Red Nose Day - which took place in March. 'I can't remember saying I was collecting for cystic fibrosis, but it had been a long day - I may have said it,' he told officers. 'I have collected for cystic fibrosis before and raised money for them.' Prosecutor Karen Saffman asked jobless Smith why he did not have time to collect money on Red Nose Day itself, and questioned why he had spent such a large chunk of his £78-per-week in benefits on a train ticket to Rochdale. He said: 'I was going to collect money for Comic Relief - I was going to do it for a whole week across the North-West but this put the kibosh on it. 'If I walked out of my house dressed as a clown, I'd get attacked by the kids where I live.' Altercation: The incident happened in Rochdale, pictured, 40 miles from Smith's Liverpool home . Defending, Jeremy Hawthorn retorted: 'There are people who go up Mount Kilimanjaro for Cancer Relief - well, that's an awfully long way from home. Why can't they go up Scafell Pike?' It emerged during the trial that Smith had a series of similar convictions between 1996 and 2006 for fraud, which involved the forging of documents and fake collections in the name of cystic fibrosis. Smith was found guilty of being in possession of articles for use in fraud - namely a clown suit, collection bucket and charity collection form. Inspector Umer Khan said: 'This man has tried to abuse the trust and generosity of the town centre businesses and visitors for his personal gain. 'I hope this conviction will cause him to reflect and learn from his wrongdoing.'","Colin Smith went round hotel bar dressed as clown with collection bucket .

A humiliated Nick Clegg last night admitted he failed to respond vigorously enough to a series of sexual harassment complaints about his party’s former chief executive. The Deputy Prime Minister ‘made mistakes’ over the allegations against Lord Rennard, according to a highly critical report into attitudes to women among senior Liberal Democrats. Mr Clegg conceded that ‘women had been let down’ after the independent report said he should have ‘asked more questions’ when the claims – which Lord Rennard denies – arose five years ago. There were several missed chances to hold an investigation, the report added.The inquiry into the wider culture of the Liberal Democrats spanning two decades was launched after the Rennard claims surfaced earlier this year. Aside from the complaints by four women against the peer, witnesses reported 32 other sexual harassment and discrimination incidents – including one where a male parliamentarian had made inappropiate advances to a very young male worker. City fund manager Helena Morrissey – who wrote the report – yesterday admitted she was ‘shocked’ at the party’s failure to live up to its ideals of equality and liberty, adding: ‘You have got to practise what you preach’. Mrs Morrissey, who found evidence of ‘low level sexism’, said: ‘Mistakes were definitely made. They were made by Nick Clegg, Danny Alexander and Jo Swinson. 'You can make a mistake and learn  from them, it’s different from setting out to mislead or to do something wrong.’ But she added: ‘I am not exonerating Nick Clegg.’ A formal inquiry should have immediately been launched by Mr Clegg into the allegations of improper conduct involving Lord Rennard when they were raised by women in 2008, she said. Mr Clegg said the report made ‘sobering reading’ and said there was ‘no excuse’ for what had happened over 20 years in the party’s corridors of power. Lord Rennard has strenuously denied acting inappropriately towards women during his time as Lib Dem chief executive . A formal inquiry was triggered by the allegations surrounding Lord Rennard, pictured (left) after a meeting in Bangkok in 2010 and (right) at this year’s parliamentary pancake race . He added that it illustrated that . ‘stretching over a 20-year period a series of mistakes were made which . left a number of women feeling seriously let down and for that there is . absolutely no excuse whatsoever’. Mrs Morrissey also singled out Liberal Democrat ministers Jo Swinson and . Danny Alexander for adopting an ‘informal’ approach to the complaints . which was ‘ultimately not sufficient’. The inquiry was triggered by the allegations surrounding Lord Rennard . but it was widened to include how the party dealt with other complaints . of sexism and harassment. It spanned complaints from up to 20 years ago. Mrs Morrissey said it . would not be fair however to hold the party to the same standards for . events of decades ago that are expected today. Her report said former leader Charles Kennedy’s ‘relatively relaxed . management style’, compared to his predecessor Lord Ashdown’s, . ‘contributed to Chris Rennard’s power base’. Businesswoman Helena Morrissey said Mr Clegg should have ordered a formal inquiry into allegations of sexual harassment against Lord Rennard . Paul Burstow, the party’s chief whip at the time, was also told of the claims about Lord Rennard in 2008. But the allegations did not surface publicly until this year, when Channel 4 interviewed two alleged victims. At the time, the party denied that Mr Clegg had any knowledge of specific allegations about Lord Rennard. He was also quick to criticise the ‘self appointed detectives’ of the . media as newspapers also investigated the potential scandal. Mrs Morrissey said there had been ‘no malicious attempt’ to cover up the . claims but that the way they dealt with them had been ‘haphazard’. The . Deputy Prime Minister had not launched a formal inquiry because he . believed the alleged victims had not requested one and wanted to keep . their anonymity, she said. Mr Clegg told the inquiry: ‘The natural course of action had been to . challenge Chris [Lord Rennard] in respect of the allegations and this . was duly done. He then denied any wrongdoing and the affair was dropped . since none of the complainants wished to …substantiate their . allegation.’ Mrs Morrissey admitted she was ‘shocked’ by some of the complaints, such . as one Lib Dem councillor aggressively cornering a female staff member. Mrs Morrissey criticised the ‘tendency for the party to try to “handle” complaints rather than to fully and properly investigate them in a . timely, professional manner.’ Scotland Yard is investigating allegations against the peer – who has denied any wrongdoing. Lord Rennard declined to comment. Mr Clegg said he would implement all the recommendations made in Miss . Morrissey’s report ‘without delay’ and had asked her to check on . progress in 12 months. He admitted the party had to do more, adding: ‘We must be a party where . even a hint of sexism is taken seriously; where every allegation of . harassment is dealt with properly; and where there can be no fear that . power or position can be abused.’ Tim Farron, the party president, said the ‘warts and all’ report made ‘uncomfortable reading’. Mr Farron last night told Channel 4 News that he did not think any of . the ministers involved should resign over their failures as the party . now had a ‘gold standard’ for how to handle future complaints. Mrs Morrissey, chief executive of Newton Investment Management and a . mother of nine, said she nearly ‘threw in the towel’ on the inquiry when . she took one look at the LibDems’ labyrinthine structure. Her report called for a stronger anti-bullying strategy and a dedicated . office to deal with complaints. Activists should also be made to take . diversity courses to make them aware of any prejudices, she added. Several Lib Dem activists told Channel 4 News in February that Lord Rennard had made unwanted advances – claims that he denied. Although the alleged incidents happened years ago, the complainants came . forward after becoming concerned that he was involved in a candidate . training event this year. Mrs Morrissey’s report did not detail the specific allegations about Lord Rennard because they are being investigated by police.","Dozens of witnesses tell independent inquiry of chaotic way party was run .

"Private sector takes slack of public sector cuts . Rubbishes Ed Balls claims that job creation was 'complete fantasy' By . Business Reporters . PUBLISHED: . 19:24 EST, 12 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:25 EST, 12 June 2013 . More than 1.2million jobs have been created in the private sector under the Coalition. While the number of state workers has dropped by 614,000 since May 2010, the number in the private sector has jumped by 1.25million to a record 24.1million, the Office for National Statistics revealed. It makes a mockery of the claim by Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls in October 2011 that it was ‘a complete fantasy’ the private sector could mop up the jobs culled in the public sector. At current rates, two private-sector jobs are being created for every one lost in the public sector. Employment Minister Mark Hoban said: ‘It is a credit to the growth of British businesses up and down the country that we now have a record number of people employed in the private sector.’ The Government was ‘not complacent’ about a jobs market whose strength had consistently surprised economists as Britain’s weak economic recovery dragged on, he said. Despite a double-dip recession followed by a painfully slow recovery, their predictions that unemployment would rocket, possibly hitting three million, have been wide of the mark. Tory chairman Grant Shapps also praised the sharp rise in private- sector employment – up 46,000 between January and March while the public sector dropped by 22,000 – as ‘a credit to British businesses’. ‘Our priority now is to carry on getting more people into work, and to help everyone who wants to work hard and get on in life,’ he said. There is evidence that private- sector bosses have been freezing or cutting staff wages to save money instead making people redundant. Many workers are happy to accept a pay cut because they are so desperate to hold on to their job, the Institute for Fiscal Studies claimed yesterday. Rise: In the last two decades the number of over-65s in work has risen sharply from around 430,000 to more than 1million today . Bumpy: The uncertain recovery continues with a small increase in the unemployment rate to 71.6 per cent, still down on the 73 per cent peak five years ago . Benefits: Dole claimants fell last month but the numbers are still much higher than the levels seen before the financial crash and subsequent recession . ‘They attach more weight to staying in work (because their expected time to find another job is longer than in the past) than on securing higher wages,’ it said. The ONS said the average worker was getting a pay rise, if bonuses are excluded, of 0.9 per cent – far below inflation, currently 2.4 per cent. John Salt, a director of the website Totaljobs.com, said: ‘Businesses who have been treading water during the last three to four years of stagnant GDP figures can no longer afford to put off hiring and must capitalise on these signs of economic growth.’ The number of private sector jobs has risen sharply since a low of 22.5million after the 2008 financial crash . Spending cuts and a renewed focus on creating private sector jobs has seen the number of people working for the state tumble from 6.3million to 5.7million .","Private sector takes slack of public sector cuts .

"By . Steve Doughty, Social Affairs Correspondent . PUBLISHED: . 18:28 EST, 12 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:29 EST, 12 June 2013 . A senior Church of  England cleric was dubbed ‘divisive, unfair and wrong’ yesterday after suggesting older people should get less help from the state. Bishop of London Richard Chartres condemned the way today’s ‘fortunate generation’ of retirees are soaking up tax- payers’ money. He used a speech to say Government spending on so-called baby boomers – those born in the 20 years after the Second World War – ‘raises questions of intergenerational equity’. 'Divisive': Bishop Chartres has drawn criticism for a speech in which he suggested older people should get less help from the state . But the Bishop, who at 65 is himself a member of the group he criticises, has drawn rapid criticism from pension experts and pressure groups. Retirement fund specialist and author Dr Ros Altmann said: ‘What is forgotten is that this generation isn’t lucky. ‘They worked hard. They built up the economy. In reality the Government has taken advantage of them. ‘They come to the later stages of their lives after working and saving all their lives. ‘Younger people look on in envy at wealthy older people, and they think they are representative of an entire generation. But most people in their 60s and 70s are on or below average income.’ She added: ‘The idea of an intergenerational war is very dangerous to our social fabric. What young people should be doing is aspiring to be like their elders.’ Bishop Chartres, who is third in the hierarchy of the Church of England and who led the service for Margaret Thatcher’s funeral in April, said baby boomers were lucky to have seen huge improvements in their standard of living during their lives. 'Fortunate': The third in the hierarchy of the Church of England condemned the way retirees are soaking up taxpayers' money . However, state spending had more than doubled in 15 years and ‘much is absorbed by the fortunate generation to which I belong’ he added. His speech appeared to agree with some politicians and think tanks that spending on the elderly is unfair on the young and that older people could be  taxed out of larger homes. However, Neil Duncan- Jordan of the National Pensioners’ Convention said: ‘This is all a bit more complicated than the baby boomer bishop would like us to believe. ‘We should not be trying to divide one generation from another. ‘The Bishop of London thinks older people are a burden on the state. But they are the people who paid for the pensions of the generation before them, and now the working generation is paying their pensions. That is the way it has worked since 1948.’ Chris Jessop of health insurer AXA PPP said the total net contribution of older people in 2010 was estimated at about £40billion and is expected to grow to £75billion by 2030. 'Unfair': Retirement fund specialist Dr Ros Altmann said the Bishop most people in their 60s and 70s are on 'below average income' ‘We believe that this contribution will continue to grow with the older generation playing an even bigger part in the workforce and as such giving more back to society,’ he said. Michelle Mitchell of Age UK said: ‘It is important to see beyond the misconception that all older people have benefited from the boom years. ‘While a small minority are very wealthy, many more are struggling, despite having worked for decades, paid taxes and contributed to society. ‘Of those over 65, 1.7million are living in poverty with more just above the poverty line and struggling to get by.’","Bishop Richard Chartres condemns 'fortunate generation' of retirees .

Town hall chiefs are spending £150,000 on accurately measuring the amount of grass, shrubs and hedges that need cutting in all of their borough's green spaces, it was revealed today. Basildon Council in Essex said it needs the nine-month exercise ahead of a re-tendering next year - with English Landscapes, which has cut the grass since 2010, coming to the end of its contract. Land surveying firm Atlantic Geomatics, based in Penrith, Cumbria, has now been hired to measure the borough’s greenery so the council can specify how much grass must be mowed. Landscaping: Basildon Council in Essex said it needs the nine-month exercise ahead of a re-tendering next year - with English Landscapes, which has cut the grass since 2010, coming to the end of its contract . Nigel Smith, leader of Basildon’s opposition Labour group, which opposed the council privatising the service in 2010, said the expenditure ‘does sound like a bit of a shambles’. He added: ‘We opposed the privatisation of the contract in the first place, and I think we have been proved right. It would have been so much better if it was council staff carrying out these jobs. ‘One hundred and fifty thousand pounds is a load of money to be paying out on top of a contract to another company afterwards and you need to wonder about the competency of the council.’ The council said it must make sure that cutting contracts offered to companies are accurate. This means that £150,000 must be spent before a new grass cutting company can even be employed. The re-measuring exercise will take nine months to complete, and also includes an assessment of what obstacles - such as bollards and pylons - could hinder the new grass cutting efforts. The last re-measuring took place in 2008 . at a third of the cost - £45,000 - but Tory councillor Kevin Blake said . that this was a poor job that led to issues with the English Landscapes . contract. Kevin Blake, councillor for leisure . and arts, said: ‘It’s a lot of money, I make no bones about that, but . we’re talking about a huge project here. 'It . will go into the fine details rather than a finger in the air job. I . don’t want to spend £50,000 and then run into problems later down the . line. What you pay for is what you get.’ Eager gardener: The exercise is reminiscent of Mr Fussy from the Mr Men children's book series, who always insisted on ensuring every blade of his grass was straight and that his flowers all grew in a straight line . The council added that Atlantic . Geomatics has the specialist equipment required to carry out the . project, and it is a sophisticated process with the data being recorded . and stored electronically. The . council served 61 rectification notices and 40 default notices to . English Landscapes in a six-month period shortly after the grass-cutting . was privatised. TaxPayers' Alliance campaign manager Eleanor McGrath said: ‘Local residents will . be absolutely aghast at the amount of money Basildon Council is paying . these expensive contractors for this ludicrous project. ‘Taxpayers want to know that their . council is spending their hard-earned cash on frontline and essential . services, not on bizarre exercises like this. Basildon Council needs to . rethink its spending priorities at once, put local residents first and . deliver far better value for money for local residents.’ 'It does sound like a bit of a shambles' Nigel Smith, Basildon's Labour leader . The exercise is reminiscent of the green-fingered Mr Fussy . character from the Mr Men children's book series, who always insisted on ensuring . every blade of his grass was straight and that his flowers all grew in a . straight line. But a Basildon Council spokesman told MailOnline: ‘This is a major and vital piece of work that has to be done in preparation for the next tender exercise in 2014 which will be for a contract that has a value of up to £1.5million per year. 'We have to recount obstacles and re-measure shrubs and hedges across the entire Borough which is 42.5 sq miles. 'This is to make sure the information we have is up to date and will ensure that we get value for money from the next contract that we award, which is worth millions of pounds. 'The last re-measuring exercise took place in 2008 and cost around £45,000. However, the new re-measuring exercise is more expensive because it will be a much more sophisticated process, with information being recorded electronically.'","Basildon Council carrying out exercise ahead of a re-tendering next year .

Ireland's prime minister has revealed he has been sent letters written in blood and branded a murderer by opponents of his government's plans to allow limited access to abortion. Enda Kenny's government agreed draft legislation in April to allow for limited access to abortion where a woman's life is in danger, including the threat of suicide. It follows months of protests from both sides of the debate on an issue that has polarised the country for decades. Abused: Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny hopes to enact legislation on abortion before parliament adjourns in July . After some 40,000 people massed outside government offices in Dublin on Saturday in the largest anti-abortion demonstration in traditionally Roman Catholic Ireland's history, Kenny delivered a trenchant defence of the government's plans. 'I am now being branded by personnel around the country as being a murderer, that I am going to have on my soul the death of 20 million babies,' Kenny told parliament on Wednesday, detailing how he had been sent items of Catholic regalia and threatening messages. 'I'm getting medals, scapulars, plastic foetuses, letters written in blood, telephone calls all over the system and it's not confined to me.' A two-decade debate over how Ireland should deal with a Supreme Court ruling that abortion be permitted when a woman's life was in danger was re-opened last year after the death of a woman who was denied an abortion of her dying foetus. Pro-Life Campaigners gathered in Merrion Square, Dublin, as Ireland prepares to legislate and introduce regulations to allow abortion if there is a real and substantial risk to a woman's life, including the threat of suicide . The tragedy of Indian dentist Savita Halappanavar, who . died in October last year after being refused an abortion at an Irish hospital, shook the country and stirred up debate on the issue of abortion. Her inquest was held in April and following it Mrs Halappanavar's husband  hit out . at her 'horrendous, barbaric and inhuman' treatment she received. The jury ruled that Mrs Halappanavar's death was by medical misadventure, and set out a string of . recommendations to prevent a repeat of the tragedy. Speaking . after the hearing, her widower Praveen said that University Hospital . Galway had left her to die, and did nothing to help her until after she . had miscarried their baby. 'It was too late,' he said on the . couple's fifth wedding anniversary. 'The care she received was in no way . different to staying at home.' Mr Halappanavar says he is . considering further action through the European courts, arguing that the . hospital breached his wife's right to life. Mrs Halappanavar, 31, was 17 weeks . pregnant when admitted to University Hospital Galway on October 21 last . year with an inevitable miscarriage.  She died a week later after suffering a septic blood infection. Successive governments had sidestepped . acting on the ruling, the result of a challenge by a 14-year-old rape . victim in the so-called 'X-case' of 1992 to a constitutional amendment . nine years earlier that intended to ban abortion in all instances. Kenny . hopes to enact legislation before parliament adjourns in July despite . misgivings among some among his conservative Fine Gael party and a . concerted campaign by the Ireland's once powerful Catholic Church to put . pressure on lawmakers. In a strongly worded statement on Tuesday, the Catholic Bishops of Ireland accused the government of misleading people on the abortion legislation and said every citizen 'should be deeply concerned' by the radical changes proposed. Rocked by a series of child abuse scandals, the church's influence over society has waned since the 1980s and a younger, secular generation wants to end the practice of Irish women travelling to nearby Britain to terminate their pregnancies. Kenny, a regular mass goer who delivered a once-unthinkable rebuke to the Vatican over its handling of the scandals two years ago, said he did not agree with many of the statements that the bishops had made. 'My job as taoiseach (prime minister) is to lead the government in governing for the people of the country. That is not confined to any sector of the people, it is for all of the people,' he said to applause from some members of parliament. 'Therefore I am proud to stand here as a public representative, as a taoiseach who happens to be a Catholic but not a Catholic taoiseach.'","Enda Kenny's government agreed draft legislation in April .

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . PUBLISHED: . 19:51 EST, 12 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:51 EST, 12 June 2013 . GM crops could give pigs diseases, after scientists claimed those fed the so-called Frankenstein food had inflamed stomachs and heavier uteruses. The research is significant because the digestive system and organs of pigs are similar to those of humans, who eat the pork from the animals. A group of Britain’s biggest supermarkets recently ended a ban on the feeding of GM crops to pigs and other animals on farms in this country. GM-fed female pigs had on average a 25 per cent heavier uterus than non-GM-fed pigs - a sign of disease . The trial involved 168 newly-weaned pigs in a commercial piggery in America . Meat, milk and eggs from these animals is not labelled as having come from animals fed on GM crops. The latest study will embarrass the Government, which supports GM crops and food, based on assurances that they have been proven safe for humans and the environment. However, the research suggests this cannot be taken for granted. It was led by Dr Judy Carman, associate professor in health and the environment at Flinders University, Australia. She said GM-fed female pigs had on average a 25 per cent heavier uterus than non-GM-fed females, which is a possible indicator of disease. Also, severe inflammation in stomachs was markedly higher in pigs on a GM diet. Calling the results ‘striking’, she added: ‘We found these results in farm conditions, not in a laboratory, but with the benefit of strict scientific controls. We need to investigate if people are also getting digestive problems from eating GM crops.’ The trial involved 168 newly weaned pigs fed either GM soya and corn, or an equivalent non-GM diet. The pigs were reared under identical housing and feeding conditions, while they were slaughtered once they were over five months of age, which is normal for commercial production. They were autopsied by qualified veterinarians who worked ‘blind’ – they were not informed which pigs were fed on the GM diet and which were not. But Professor Tom Sanders, of  King’s College, London, said: ‘There were no differences in growth and mortality rates and pigs appeared in similar health.’ A Cambridge professor, David Spiegelhalter, said: ‘The  conclusions don’t stand up to statistical scrutiny.’ Iowa-based farmer and crop and livestock advisor Howard Vlieger, one of the coordinators of the study, said: ‘For as long as GM crops have been in the feed supply, we have seen increasing digestive and reproductive problems in animals. Now it is scientifically documented. Environment Minister Owen Paterson dismissed scepticism of GM as 'complete nonsense' ‘In some cases, animals eating GM crops are very aggressive. This is not surprising, given the scale of stomach irritation and inflammation now documented.’ The Biotechnology Industry Organisation said: ‘This study was authored by anti-biotech campaigners. Hundreds of independent studies found no difference between animals fed GM or non-GM diets.’ The news comes as Owen Paterson, Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, claims opposition to GM food should be cast aside in the interests of the economy and our ability to feed the world. Mr Paterson has dismissed scepticism of GM as ‘complete nonsense’. A spokesman said: ‘The world’s population is set to hit nine billion by 2050, and we must increase food production, minimise waste and boost competition. We must not ignore technologies, including GM, that can meet the challenge.’","Research significant because pigs organs are similar to humans .

"By . Ruth Styles . PUBLISHED: . 10:32 EST, 11 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:41 EST, 12 June 2013 . Tragically, for increasing numbers of couples, starting a family isn't as simple as it's supposed to be. Whether it's polycystic ovaries, a low sperm count or, worst of all, unexplained infertility, many are forced to make the heartbreaking decision to spend their savings on IVF or give up on their dreams of family life altogether. But a solution could be on the horizon courtesy of a groundbreaking new method called 'Neuroscientific Fertility Treatment', which is claimed to have results within 24 weeks. Healthy: Neuroscientific Fertility Treatment improves wellbeing as part of helping would-be mothers conceive . The new treatment focuses on removing mental blockages that prevent pregnancy and reducing the stress hormone cortisol, which can also impede conception. As well as improving patients' mental state, the treatment programme also helps boost physical health - creating the optimum conditions for conception. Other recommendations include having regular sex throughout the cycle in order to reduce pressure during fertile times and staying hydrated. Created by neuroscientist, Michael Arnold, the programme is totally natural and, according to Arnold, has a success rate of between 66 and 77 per cent depending on the reason for infertility. Other research carried out by Arnold and his team found that 75 per cent of couples who committed to at least 20 treatments over a six month period achieved a successful pregnancy, compared to just  32.3 per cent with IVF. Effective: According to Dr Arnold, 77 per cent of patients are pregnant within 9 months of having acupuncture . 1. Have regular intercourse . Research has shown that couples who have . regular intercourse (at least three times per week) throughout the cycle can double their chances of . getting pregnant. Couples who have intercourse that is mainly . concentrated around ovulation will take longer to conceive. The fertile . window is much larger than most people realise as both sperm eggs can . live for several days inside the womb, prior to fertilisation. What's . more, the stress caused by figuring out the 'most fertile time' can . actually reduce your chances of success. 2.  Stay hydrated . Flow is an essential principle of Five . Elements Acupuncture, which teaches that body, mind and emotions are interconnected as modern research in psychoneuroimmunology and . neuroscience is now corroborating. Staying adequately hydrated is . essential to maintain flow. For cells to function properly, for organ . systems to connect and work well together,  and  to maximise fertility, . drink at least 1 1/2 litres a day of filtered or bottled water. Your urine . should be a light yellow, straw-like colour. This prevents the . accumulation of unwanted and waste materials, which can lead to fatigue, . stress, blocks and stagnation in joints, gut, blood, body . organs, thoughts and feelings. 3. Eat breakfast every morning between seven and nine . Your body follows daily rhythms and . patterns. Certain organs have times of peak activity. For the stomach, . this time is between seven and nine every morning. At this time, the body is . most receptive to taking in vital nutrients. It is therefore essential . to ensure that you eat a good breakfast every morning. If this window is . missed, you will not be able to make up for it later in the day. Conversely the stomach is least active between seven and nine in the evening so this is . the worst time to have your biggest meal of the day. When people say . breakfast is the most important meal of the day they are not joking. To . maximise your nutrient intake follow the adage 'Breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince, dinner like a pauper'. 4. Forget five a day . Instead, you should be aiming for nine a day, as the natural antioxidants help protect . the egg, sperm and developing cells from daily damage. 5 . Make sure you're asleep by 11pm . Nighttime is when your body goes into . growth and repair mode. Healthy sperm and eggs develop and the whole . body regenerates. It is therefore essential that you make the most of . this period. It has been scientifically proven that the period between . 11pm and 8am is when the best sleep is possible. According to ancient Chinese wisdom, 11pm marks the start of a new phase of activity - . characterised by physical and mental rejuvenation. Obviously the odd . late night does you no harm but if you regularly go to bed after 11pm . your body will not get the full benefits of a good night's sleep. 6. Exercise for 30 minutes, three times per week . Regular exercise is essential to ensure . your body is in the optimum condition for conception to occur. Not only . does it stimulate the heart and circulatory system, it also increases . the body's capacity to take in and use oxygen. This is the vital . substance that every cell in the body needs to create energy and growth. Regular exercise also leads to reduced stress levels, which is another . vital ingredient in a successful pregnancy. 7. Get in touch with nature . With our busy lives and our concrete . cities, we tend to forget that, as human beings, we too are a part of nature. Five Elements Acupuncture is governed by the laws of nature and . puts us back in touch with our own unique nature. Healing is a natural . function. When you cut yourself you don't have to figure out how to make . the cut heal. Nature takes care of that. At least once a week  remind . yourself of this by taking a walk  in the countryside, a park or wood, . or just sitting by a river or flowing water. Look at the sky and listen . to the birds sing reconnect, slow down and appreciate being a part of nature. This restores balance and harmony to your body, emotions and . mind, and regulates body chemicals and hormones, essential for . fertility. Neuroscience now backs what we all instinctively know to be . true - that being in touch with nature is good for you. 8. Get your fat balance right . Sperm . health, hormone balance and healthy circulation all depend on it, so limit . saturated fat from intensively reared animals and include daily . well-chewed or ground seeds. Avoid foods fried at a high temperature and . all hydrogenated fats. Also take a purified fish oil, or safer . still an algae oil, supplement. 9. Avoid alcohol and caffeine . In men both have been shown to reduce fertility and make pregnancy take twice as long to achieve. 10. Get tested . Before people start the programme, we . test their hair for potentially harmful heavy metals which can hinder . fertility and run an adrenal stress test to help determine whether their cortisol and DHEA levels need support to optimise fertility. 11. Be mindful . To reduce your stress and cortisol . levels, restore balance to your internal organ systems, and maximise . fertility, it's essential to play the 'Inner Game of Health', so your . brain sends the right signals to your body. Take a moment, maybe a minute, out of every . hour when you are at work to become aware of your breath, check . through your body and notice how you are feeling. Accept this without . judgement  or evaluation, take one big deep breathe, exhale completely, . and move on. Even 20 to 30 seconds will help reduce stress,  rewire your . brain and promote healthy changes in your body. 12. Avoid environmental toxins where possible . In particular the hormone disrupting . chemical, BPA  found in plastics and lined tin cans, which may hinder . implantation. Especially avoid buying, storing and heating high fat . foods such as oils and cheese and acidic foods such as tinned tomatoes.

Greece's government was in crisis last night after a breathtaking decision to close down the country’s equivalent of the BBC. The conservative-led coalition appeared in danger of collapse – an outcome that could send Greece crashing out of the euro – after sending in police to end transmissions by the state-run broadcaster. Television and radio signals from the Hellenic Broadcasting Corp, or ERT, went dead early yesterday, hours after the government closed the corporation and fired its 2,700 workers, citing the need to cut ‘incredible waste’. The International Monetary Fund, European Union and European Central Bank had demanded that 2,000 public sector jobs be cut within months as the price of Greece’s bailout and place in the single currency. Scroll down to watch . The control room of the Greek National Television as technicians try to stay live on air following an announcement that the government has made a decision to close it . Greece state television ERT's employees gather in the station's headquarters in Agia Paraskevi after the government announced ERT's closure . ERT's workforce has occupied the broadcasting company's headquarters in protest against the government's decision . The Greek government said it planned to launch a new, slimmed-down broadcaster. Thousands of protesters gathered . outside the company's headquarters north of Athens as journalists defied . the order and continued a live Internet broadcast. Nonetheless, government spokesman Simos Kedikoglou - a former state TV journalist - described ERT as a 'haven of waste' and TV and radio signals went dead early today. 'ERT is a typical example of unique lack of transparency and incredible waste. And that ends today,' Kedikoglou said. 'It costs three to seven times as much . as other TV stations and four to six times the personnel - for a very . small viewership, about half that of an average private station.' He said its 2,500 employees will be compensated and the company will reopen 'as soon as possible' with a smaller workforce. Yesterday's announcement did not make immediately clear how long that would take. Employees of ERT kept on reporting live into the early morning at the television station's headquarters after the government announced its closure . Crowds gather to demonstrate outside the Greek public broadcasting company ERT after the Greek government halted its television and radio broadcasts . An estimated 10,000 people, including ERT employees, staged a mass demonstration outside the Channel's offices . It . is the first case of mass public sector layoffs in the recession-mired . country, which has pledged to cut 15,000 state jobs by 2015 as part of . its bailout commitments. Debt-stifled Greece has depended on rescue loans from its European partners and the International Monetary Fund since May 2010. In exchange, it imposed deeply resented . income cuts and tax hikes, which exacerbated a crippling recession and . forced tens of thousands of businesses to close, sending unemployment to . a record of 27 percent. The so-called 'troika' of the European . Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund has been . pressing the government to start a long-delayed program to fire civil . servants. Kedikoglou insisted the government had 'no need' to inform the troika officials of its decision. The European Commission said it had . not sought the closure of ERT but 'nor does the Commission question the . Greek government's mandate to manage the public sector.' Greece's POESY media union accused the government of sacrificing the broadcaster to appease its creditors. Yesterday afternoon the minister responsible for the media, Simos Kedikoglou, announced the deeply unpopular decision to immediately shut down the public television and radio broadcaster . After the announcement, thousands rushed to the main ERT headquarters in a northern Athens suburb to show their support for the broadcaster . 'Bailout . creditors are demanding civil service layoffs and the government, in . order to meet its obligations toward foreign monitors, is prepared to . sacrifice the public broadcasting corporation,' a union statement said. Unions . representing ERT workers at three terrestrial TV stations, one . satellite station and its national and regional radio network said they . would keep the stations on the air. Protesting . employees gathered at the company headquarters in the Athens suburb of . Aghia Paraskevi, together with opposition lawmakers and union leaders, . to oppose the move. Now Greece's two largest labor unions . called a 24-hour general strike on Thursday to protest the government's . decision that has shocked the public and triggered a political crisis. The civil servants' union ADEDY said it had called a strike and a series of protests to be held outside the ERT headquarters. The larger GSEE union was also meeting to ratify the decision and join the nationwide strike, officials from that union said. Journalist unions also launched rolling 24-hour strikes, halting private television news programs. The shock announcement widened cracks in . the year-old conservative-led governing coalition, with both minority . partners condemning the suspension of ERT. Protesters hang a banner, which reads 'Resistance', at ERA Patras, following to close the broadcaster and slash some 2,500 jobs as part of the country's cost-cutting drive . A government spokesman said the 2,500 employees will be compensated and the company will reopen 'as soon as possible' with a smaller workforce. Conservative Prime Minister Antonis Samaras faces stern opposition from his own coalition partners - the Socialist Pasok and Democratic Left party - for the decision. Left-wing opposition leader Alexis Tsipras slammed the closure as 'illegal' during an interview on ERT's online broadcast. 'Many times the word 'coup' is used as an exaggeration,' he said. 'In this case, it is not an exaggeration.' Tsipras said he would meet the . country's president later Wednesday and ask him to cancel an executive . order he signed allowing the government to close ERT. The decision to close ERT was announced during an inspection in Athens by officials from Greece's bailout creditors. The executive order to close ERT must be ratified by parliament within three months but cannot be approved without backing from the minority coalition lawmakers. The surprise closure of ERT is now one of the biggest crises to afflict the three-party coalition government since it was formed nearly a year ago. Despite tensions over a number of issues, notably related to the austerity measures demanded by Greece's international creditors, the coalition government has surprised many by surviving. It has also been credited with stabilizing the bailed out Greek economy and easing the threat of an exit from the euro. ERT started radio programming in the 1930s and television in the mid-1096s. Though it was widely regarded as reflecting government positions - it had a channel run by the military during the 1967-74 dictatorship - the broadcaster was also valued for showcasing regional and cultural content and for covering major sporting events such as the football World Cup and the Olympics. The BBC is one of the the largest broadcasters in the world by number of employees. The total average headcount of the BBC's service was 16,858 for the year ending 2011/12. Its work is primarily funded by a licence fee, which is paid by households, businesses and organisations who receive its live broadcasts. Last year the licence fee was £145.50 - this equated to £3,606m licence-fee funded services. This funded 10 UK-wide TV channels, national and regional TV services across the UK, 10 UK-wide radio networks, two national radio services each in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, 40 local radio stations in England and the BBC Online. In contrast, Greece's ERT employs around 2,700 people for its television and radio broadcasters. Around 88 per cent of ERT's funding comes from television licence fees. ERT operates two television networks with national coverage, one nationwide television network, two regional television stations, one worldwide satellite channel, and three digital channels. The company operates 19 regional radio stations, two worldwide radio stations, six national radio stations and three ERT-3 radio stations - two with local and one with worldwide coverage. It produces four musical ensembles and publishes Radiotileorasi, a weekly radio and television magazine.

Panicked: Barb Kasang was distraught after losing her wedding ring while working at the same job she'd shared with her husband for 28 years . While Anderson’s reaction was one of mild amusement, up in Chicago Barb Kasang was frantically searching for her diamond ring. ‘My whole marriage is tied up in my ring,’ Kasang told KATV. ‘It has a lot of special moments.’ Kasang and husband Stave have been married for 28 years. They met at Lovejoy, a manufacturer of transmission parts in Downers Grove, Illinois. In fact, they both still work there. And . that’s where Kasang, 51, noticed she’d lost her wedding ring while . washing her hands after working the shipping department. The same ring . her loving husband had been adding gems and bands to over the years. Long lost: Barb's husband had been adding stones and bands since they married. Barb was worried she accidentally shipped the ring while sending out boxes for work . Lost and found: That was last Monday in Chicago. On Wednesday, in Arkansas, Steve Anderson found a wedding ring in a box that had been shipped to his job . ‘I was worried, hurt and sad,’ she told the Chicago Tribune. ‘It was traumatic. I didn't even want to tell my husband.’ But she did tell him. ‘He was pretty calm,’ Kasang said. ‘He said, “Don't worry about it, we'll replace it.” But it's not the same. To me, it's not just a ring. It's like half of my life is in there.’ That was back on June 3. Two agonizing days passed. Good deed: 'I like to do what is right' said Anderson. He returned the ring and within a week of losing it, the ring was back on Barb's finger . Thankful: Barb, here with her husband, was thrilled. 'My heart's still pounding,' she said. 'You can't say enough about people like that.' Meanwhile, Anderson made his find and knew someone was out there worried. ‘I thought if it was real, someone would be really upset about it,’ he said. Anderson said he’d lost important things of his own in the past and been blessed to have them returned. ‘I think turnabout is fair play,’ he said. ‘The thing about it is, I like to do what is right.’ Then, on Wednesday, Kasang got a phone call. Anderson was on the line, he'd found her ring and tracked her down. By Friday, she was happily wearing her ring again. ‘My heart's still pounding,’ Kasang said. ‘We got lucky. He deserves a big blessing. There's some good people out there. You can't say enough about people like that. I think this man should really be praised.’ According to Anderson, though, there are just more honest people out there than we think.","650 miles away from the Chicago suburb where she accidentally sent it with a shipment while at work, Barb Kasang's beloved wedding ring was found by kind man in North Little Rock, Arkansas ."

She has been pivotal in Mulberry's success over the past six years but it was today announced that Emma Hill will be stepping down from her role as creative director for the British brand. According to trade magazine WWD, the 42-year-old quit over 'disagreements with management over creative and operational strategy'. British-born Ms Hill joined Mulberry in 2007 and was credited with turning the Somerset-based firm from a trusted briefcase and wallet maker into an international fashion powerhouse with a clutch of celebrity fans, including the Duchess of Cambridge. Departure: Emma Hill has stepped down from her role as creative director of Mulberry . Magic: Hill with Alexa Chung, whose namesake bag became a global success . Profits soared as its Alexa and Del Rey . designs (named after TV presenter Alexa Chung and singer Lana del Rey) were picked up by A-list stars around the world. Last year Ms Hill was made a CBE for her services to British fashion. She joined Mulberry after previously working on accessories at Burberry, Marc Jacobs and Gap. As she now moves on again, she is yet to comment on her reasons for leaving and what her next role will be. A spokeswoman for the company declined to comment on the claim that Ms Hill had fallen out with the management. In a statement the brand said: 'Mulberry confirms . that Emma has informed the company that she wishes to leave after a very . successful period at Mulberry during which she has built a strong and . talented creative team working for her. 'The timing of her departure is currently under discussion and has yet to be finalised.' Honours: Hill was awarded a CBE in November last year .

The company said its main spring/summer . collection for 2014 had been completed and that Ms Hill was continuing . to work in the business finalising the London Fashion Week collection to . be launched in September. Ms Hill's departure comes after Bruno Guillon took over as chief executive a year ago. He said at the time that he wanted to work towards getting the 'right balance' between Mulberry’s long-term aspirations and its short-term performance. Success: Hill's catwalk shows, held at London's Claridge's Hotel, became one of the most sought-after tickets of London Fashion Week . Seal of approval: U.S. Vogue editor Anna Wintour (centre, in sunglasses) attended the Mulberry A/W13 show at Claridge's last year - a sure sign Hill had made Mulberry relevant in the global market . However, Mulberry's profits have fallen in the last year and on Thursday it is expected to reveal it has been . hit by tougher markets in Asia and a post-Christmas fall in tourist . spending. Analysts expect pre-tax profits for the year to the end of March to fall to £26 million from last year's £36 million when results are announced later this week. Investors' hopes that Mulberry can regain momentum after better results from other luxury goods brands may be hit by Ms Hill's departure.

"By . Geoffrey Levy . PUBLISHED: . 18:11 EST, 11 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:30 EST, 12 June 2013 . Character: Sir Henry Cecil, one of the greatest racehorse trainers of all time died yesterday at the age of 70 . Side by side the two figures — one very tall and elegant, the other diminutive and stocky — walked stiffly across the paddock to the horse that one had trained and the other was about to ride in the big race. All around them at Glorious Goodwood races there were tense and almost disbelieving faces as the trainer gave his jockey a routine ‘leg-up’ into the saddle. This was a very different kind of race-day tension, one that even in the libidinous, hot‑breath world of horses and riders, Jilly Cooper and Dick Francis might have had difficulty describing. For the gossip had spread like a hot race tip: everyone knew that just a few hours earlier, the trainer, the elegant aristocrat Henry Cecil, had terminated the contract of his stable jockey Kieren Fallon, son of an Irish plasterer, for sleeping with his wife Natalie after romping in a shower — a claim the jockey has always vehemently denied. It was too late to change riders, though. Yesterday Sir Henry died of cancer at the age of 70, bringing to a close a life marked almost as much by scandal as by his achievements as one of the greatest racehorse trainers the sport of kings has ever known. ‘Good with fillies,’ was the running joke in the racing world, for Henry Cecil, something of a dandy, was himself no innocent when it came to illicit relationships. In recent times he trained the  extraordinary Frankel, owned by Prince Khalid Abdullah of Saudia Arabia, to win 14 races without defeat. Dying of stomach cancer, and very weak, Cecil lived to see this unique stallion proclaimed the finest racehorse in the world. Friends are convinced that the chain-smoking dandy in colourful waistcoats and Gucci loafers (who would sometimes give his handmade shirts away at the end of the season to more needy racing folk) was sustained through his illness by the thrill of working with the best horse anyone had seen in his lifetime. With wife number one: Sir Cecil's first marriage was to Julie Murless, the daughter of another racehorse trainer Sir Noel Murless . Henry Cecil had been at the top — but  he’d also been almost to the bottom and close to bankruptcy. He never lost faith in himself, though: he said that utter self-confidence was the only thing he was good at. Before horses, he’d never thrived at anything, even failing the entrance exam to Eton. His father, younger brother of the 3rd Lord Amherst of Hackney, was killed in action in World War II, and Henry was still a baby when his widowed 27-year-old mother married the famous trainer Sir Cecil Boyd-Rochfort, who was 57. Until then Sir Cecil, who trained the Queen’s horses, had been viewed as a confirmed bachelor, but he set about teaching his stepson everything he could about training horses. It was a profession that was to lead Henry Cecil into a series of extraordinary social scandals. At first, it seemed like the perfect racing partnership when Henry married Julie Murless, daughter of another knighted trainer of the post-war years, Sir Noel Murless. Sir Noel’s wedding gift to them was Warren Place, his famous racing establishment on the edge of Newmarket. With wife number two: Sir Cecil married second wife Natalie when she was aged 23 and he was 48 . And it was not long before Henry Cecil was training the first of his 25 classic winners — including four Epsom Derbys — and attracting the richest and most ambitious owners. Among them was the most ambitious  of them all, Dubai’s fabulously wealthy Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. By the late Eighties, Henry and Julie had been married some 23 years and had a son and a daughter. That was when Natalie Payne, the daughter of a doctor, arrived in his life. It was at the staff Christmas party in 1989 that the languorously good-looking Henry and the pretty Natalie, always so fetching in her breeches, got talking over a glass of wine. She was running a breaking yard for young horses near Newmarket and Cecil took his yearlings to her. The following spring he took her to the horse sales. By the end of the year, his 24-year marriage to Julie had been dissolved. Incredibly, and with astonishing loyalty to owners such as Sheik Mohammed — who would have been mortified for Warren Place to be broken up in a division of marital property — it was Julie who agreed to move out of the home where she had grown up. She started a training establishment of her own in Newmarket. Cecil’s  head lad Paddy Rudkin, meanwhile, was so disgusted by the goings-on that he left. Wife number three: Jane was Sir Henry's secretary before they married five years ago . Henry had already been champion trainer nine times by then. He would win that title only once more, in 1993. The previous year, aged 48, he had married 23-year-old Natalie. And with her arrival, things had changed at the yard considered to be the ‘pinnacle of British racing’. No one objected when the new Mrs Cecil redecorated Warren Place to her own taste, but other things were being changed, such as the type of food the horses were getting. Sheik Mohammed grew increasingly unhappy, so much so that in 1995 he removed all 40 of his horses that were in training with Cecil — a major blow. A story was put out that he was angry because he hadn’t been told that one of his horses was injured, but another version was that the trainer’s wife was interfering, and the Sheik — the biggest owner in Britain — refused to put up with it. It was a hammer-blow to Henry Cecil, who had to build up his reputation all over again. He hadn’t lost his talent, and he had other wealthy owners, but his image was damaged. A year later, the tough and personable Irish jockey Kieren Fallon arrived to work for Cecil, and was soon riding winners and was proclaimed champion jockey. Not surprisingly, after the Sheik’s sudden departure, Natalie Cecil’s new-found influence with the horses was much diminished. As Henry concentrated on re-establishing himself as the best in the business, the marriage began to disintegrate. Passed away: Sir Henry Cecil, who trained Frankel during his glittering career, has died age 70 . Success: Cecil in 2011 with horse Frankel and jockey Tom Queally after winning the Qipco 2000 Guineas Stakes . Within the intimate horsey fraternity of the racing town, some people, especially old friends of Henry’s former wife Julie, had always been hostile to Natalie. Now, they could be openly aggressive. Cecil’s response was not to remonstrate with his old friends and racing colleagues, but to tell his new wife that she ‘had to earn their respect’. She began drinking and putting on weight, then fought the resulting depression with more alcohol, diet pills and Prozac. It was on a visit to Ireland to look at some horses in 1999 that she had a one-night stand with someone she later described as ‘a leading jockey’. Until then, she said: ‘I had been 100  per cent faithful. I met someone who made me laugh ... one thing led  to another.’ They had sex in a shower and more sex in the bedroom. To her dismay and Henry Cecil’s mortification, the story found its way — via a friend in whom she had confided — on to the front page of the News of the World. The following day, Cecil sacked Kieren Fallon for unspecified ‘personal reasons’, though Fallon denied he was the jockey involved. Record breaker: Cecil, pictured with the Queen in 1985, has the most winners at Royal Ascot . Honoured: Cecil was knighted in 2011 for services to horse racing . As for Natalie, she said: ‘I’ll always . regret it because I had let myself down. I told Henry what had happened . before the article appeared. He was understanding and said: “We do . these things when we are low.” ’ Henry . Cecil must have been pretty low himself when, some time after this, he . paid a prostitute called Claire Jacobs £800 to spend the night with him . at the Grand Hotel in Brighton. And, yes, this also made the front page . of the News of the World. Natalie, . fighting her addictions in The Priory clinic in South-West London at . the time, was shown the newspaper by a fellow patient. Then Henry . arrived, carrying a teddy and hoping in vain for a reconciliation. She . had a few words with him — ‘a few loud words’. He issued a statement . admitting being with Miss Jacobs all night, but denying they ‘had sex’. Couple: But Cecil divorced second wife Natalie after mutual allegations of infidelity . It . was all so very messy and, for his friends, so disappointing that the . seamier side of this genial and generous man should overshadow his . genius with horses. There . are various theories about why his career slumped to crisis level after . the turn of the century, when he slipped out of fashion with some of the . newer owners. Some say they simply went for younger trainers; others insist Cecil was seen by many as ‘soiled goods’. His yard, once filled with 200 racehorses, was down to just 50 and he had difficulty making ends meet. One . important owner stood by him through thick and thin. This was Prince . Khalid, a highly dignified man.   Among the horses he gave him to train . was one called Frankel, who turned out to be a wonder horse. And, in 2011, in the Queen’s Birthday Honours, Henry Cecil was knighted. Sir . Henry’s climb back to the top began before Frankel, however. Friends . believe it had much to do with the support of his third wife, Jane, who . was his secretary before they married five years ago. So what happened to the others? First . wife Julie has retired from training and still lives in Newmarket. Natalie, who has never confirmed the identity of her one-night-stand . ‘leading jockey’, now lives quietly  in Chelsea. Kieren . Fallon took legal action against Cecil and in an out-of-court . settlement is understood to have got £200,000 for loss of earnings. He . is  still riding. As for . that horse Fallon rode that day at Glorious Goodwood when he and Henry . Cecil stood side by side for the last time — it came nowhere.

Historic county names that date back nearly 1,000 years will be brought back to life as part of an effort to champion the 'local history that makes us who we are'. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles  has pledged to formally recognise 'abolished' county names such as Cumberland, Huntingdonshire and Westmorland. The names disappeared during Edward Heath's government in 1972, but could be seen across the country again if councils erect signs bearing their names. Communities Minister Eric Pickles has pledged to bring back historic county names that date back nearly 1,000 years . The move is being seen as a symbolic gesture to celebrate St George’s Day. Mr Pickles wants residents and local authorities to start using the historic names as much as possible to remind ourselves of the 'tapestry' of England. As part of the initiative, the Government has now set up an online map to allow people to see the layout of the historic counties. Mr Pickles said: 'No Westminster officials or European bureaucrats can remove people’s loyalty to the country they were born in. 'From Cumberland to Huntingdonshire . or Middlesex to Westmorland, our local history makes us who we are and . do what we do. It’s all part of being English. The tapestry of England’s counties binds our nation together.' Lost over time: A map of the historic counties of England which shows where the abolished ones of Cumberland, Westmorland, Huntingdonshire and Middlesex used to be located . How they are now: This image shows the metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties map which came into existence after the reforms under the Local Government Act 1972 . He said the current government has . 'binned the arbitrary Government Office Euro-Regions' and was instead . 'championing England’s traditional local identities which continue to . run deep'. He added: 'Administrative restructuring by previous governments has sought to suppress and undermine such local identities. 'Today, . on St George's Day, we commemorate our patron saint and formally . acknowledge the continuing role of our traditional counties in England’s . public and cultural life.' Rupert Barnes, the vice-chairman of the Association of British Counties, welcomed the move, saying: 'The counties are the basic tapestry on which countless generations have made their lives. The move is being seen as a symbolic gesture to celebrate St George¿s Day . 'They have shaped our identities and our view of ourselves and have remained a constant throughout centuries of change to become a vital part of British culture, geography and heritage. 'The counties predate any transient lines drawn for convenience or administration and predate the kingdom itself, rooted in history and cultural identity, so that the ancient counties are of the people not of the state. 'Statutes on administration have respectfully left the ancient counties alone. 'This pattern of the counties brought down to us through the centuries then is the pattern around which the nation has grown and grown great, and worthy of celebration.' WESTMORLAND . The Normans conquered this county in 1092 and created the baronies of Kendal and Westmorland, which were then formed into the single county of Westmorland in 1226. It formed an administrative county in 1889 under the Local Government Act 1888 until 1974, after which it became part of the county of Cumbria. But there is still the Westmorland Gazette or the Westmorland Shopping Centre in Kendal.MIDDLESEX . The county ceased as an administrative council in 1965. The former area now corresponds too much of Greater London and parts of Berkshire, Hertfordshire and Surrey. Middlesex is still used in the names of organisations based in the area, such as Middlesex County Cricket Club and Middlesex University.CUMBERLAND . This is an historic county of North West England that had an administrative function from the 12th century until 1974. The first record of 'Cumberland' was in 945. In 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, the council was abolished and combined with parts of Lancashire and the West Riding of Yorkshire to form part of the new county of Cumbria. But the name continues today most famously as in Cumberland sausage, the HMS Cumberland, nicknamed 'the fighting sausage', the Cumberland County Cricket Club, and as the local newspaper The Cumberland News.HUNTINGDONSHIRE . This former area covers Huntingdon, St Ives, Godmanchester, St Neots, and Ramsey and formed an administrative county between 1889 and 1965. Under the Local Government Act 1972, Huntingdon and Peterborough merged to form the new non-metropolitan county of Cambridgeshire.

A Confederate battle flag hanging inside the old North Carolina State Capitol to mark the sesquicentennial of the Civil War last week is being taken down after upset by civil rights leaders. The decision was announced hours after a story ran about the flag that explained it as part of an historical display intended to replicate how the antebellum building appeared in 1863. The flag had been planned to hang in the House chamber until April 2015, the 150th anniversary of the arrival of federal troops in Raleigh before its forced removal. Removed: A Confederate flag is seen on display at the Old Capitol, which houses the governor's office and still hosts numerous government events, making it therefore inappropriate for its hanging according to some . 'This is a temporary exhibit in an historic site, but I've learned the governor's administration is going to use the old House chamber as working space,' Cultural Resources Secretary Susan Kluttz said on Friday night. 'Given that information, this display will end this weekend rather than April of 2015.' Kim Genardo, the spokeswoman for Gov. Pat McCrory, said the exhibit that includes the Confederate battle flag will be relocated, possibly across the street to the N.C. Museum of History. The decision was a quick about-face for the McCrory administration, which initially defended the display. But many people see the flag as a potent reminder of racial discrimination and bigotry, calling it a flag of white supremacy. State Historic Sites Director Keith Hardison had said on Thursday the flag should be viewed in what he called the proper historical context. 'Our goal is not to create issues,' said Hardison, a Civil War re-enactor and history buff. 'Our goal is to help people understand issues of the past. ... If you refuse to put something that someone might object to or have a concern with in the exhibit, then you are basically censoring history.' Reflection: The flag is being taken down one week after its placement inside the capitol as part of a historical display intended to replicate how the antebellum building appeared in 1863 . North Carolina NAACP president Rev. William Barber was shocked on Friday when he was shown a photo of the flag by the AP. 'He is right that it has a historical context,' Barber said. 'But what is that history? The history of racism. The history of lynchings. The history of death. The history of slavery. If you say that shouldn't be offensive, then either you don't know the history, or you are denying the history.' Sessions of the General Assembly moved to a newer building a half-century ago, but the old Capitol building is still routinely used as a venue for official state government events. McCrory's office is on the first floor, as are the offices of his chief of staff and communications staff. The Republican governor was in the House chamber where the Confederate flag hangs as recently as Thursday, when he presided over the swearing-in ceremony of his new Highway Patrol commander. The presentation of the Confederate . battle flag at state government buildings has long been an issue of . debate throughout the South. For more than a decade, the NAACP has urged . its members to boycott South Carolina because of that state's display . of the flag on the State House grounds. Battle flag: Many people see the flag, the Confederacy's battle flag seen waving below the United States', as a potent reminder of racial discrimination and bigotry, calling it a flag of white supremacy . Prior to taking his current job in North Carolina in 2006, Hardison worked as director at the Mississippi home of Confederate President Jefferson Davis, which is operated as a museum and library owned by the Sons of Confederate Veterans. The group has led the fight in the South for the proud display of the Confederate flag, which it contends is a symbol of heritage, not hate. Hardison said the battle flag was displayed with other flags described in the diary of a North Carolina woman who visited the Capitol in 1863. A large U.S. flag displayed in the Senate chamber is reminiscent of a trophy of war captured from Union troops at the Battle of Plymouth. 'I thought, wouldn't it be wonderful to recreate this?' Hardison said. 'I think we were all thinking along the same vein. ... The Capitol is both a working seat of government, in that the governor and his staff has his office there. But it is also a museum.' Hardison pointed out that the national . flag used by the Confederate government, with its circle of white stars . and red and white stripes, is still flown over the State Capitol dome . each year on Confederate Memorial Day. The more familiar blood-red . battle flag, featuring a blue 'X'' studded with white stars, was used by . the rebel military. National flag: The First National flag of the Confederate States of America, pictured, is annually flown over North Carolina's capitol to commemorate Confederate Memorial Day in May . David Goldfield, a history professor at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte and author of the book 'Still Fighting the Civil War,' said the battle flag can hold starkly different meanings depending on a person's social perspective. 'The history of the Confederate battle flag, how it was designed and formulated, how it has been used through the years, clearly states that it is a flag of white supremacy,' Goldfield said. 'I know current Sons of Confederate Veterans would dispute that, saying “Hey, I'm not a racist.” But the fact remains that the battle flag was used by a country that had as its foundation the protection and extension of human bondage.' The NAACP's Barber said the McCrory administration eventually made the right call, but questioned how the decision to hang the flag was made in the first place. 'A flag should represent a banner of unity, not division,' Barber said. 'A substantive symbol and sign of our best history, not our worse. We cannot deny history but neither can we attempt to revision it in a way that glorifies the shameful and attempts to make noble that which is ignoble.'","Confederate battle flag was hanging inside the old North Carolina State Capitol this week to mark the sesquicentennial of the Civil War .

The multi-platinum Hips Don’t Lie singer failed to guide even one contestant into the final on her first and only run with the talent show. But the Latin bombshell was not the only ‘small and humble’ one – she gained a partner in defeat when Adam Levine’s final contestant was simultaneously eliminated too. Scroll down for video . End of the road: Adam Levine and Shakira's remaining contestants on The Voice were booted out on Tuesday's show . Shakira has received mixed reviews for her banter and coaching choices on the primetime programme and the mum-of-one looked genuinely crestfallen when her final girl, Sasha Allen, was knocked out. Despite Shakira’s confidence in her protégée's  ‘phenomenal voice’ Sasha, a young mother from New York, was booted out by the voting public. ‘She works so hard and has so much determination, and that’s what it takes to make it in this industry,’ said the Columbian songstress before Sasha was sent home. Maroon 5 frontman Adam Levine also suffered a blow when his last donkey in the race, a blonde who models herself on Dolly Parton, albeit without the songwriting ability, was rejected too. Oh brother: The Swon siblings looked doomed as they were up against favourite Sasha Allen . Enough to make your nose bleed: Blake was feeling the pressure just before the lucky act staying in was announced . The Moves Like Jagger singer has spent weeks waxing lyrical about Texan girl Amber Carrington and repeatedly tried to convince viewers of her ‘talent’. ‘One of the best things about Amber is that she can do anything…the luxury of having Amber on your team is that she can do anything,’ he said before she was ejected from the competition. The double elimination left notorious ‘booze lover’ Blake Shelton in top place with two contestants left - Country music cutie Danielle Bradbery, 16, and the Oklahoma-based duo The Swon Brothers. ‘I have been lucky this year, I have two acts with superstar potential,’ grinned The Dreamer singer, 36, who is married to fellow musician Miranda Lambert. R&B singerUsher was left with his self-confessed ‘nerd’ and hot favourite to win Michelle Chamuel. Don't cry: Sasha Allen was less than pleased after her hopes of stardom were dashed by the audience vote . Out of the race: Adam's final hope Amber Carrington proved to be more of a donkey than a thoroughbred . Rubbing it in: Blake Shelton could not help but savour the moment after two of his acts made the final . Michelle is also one of Shakira’s darlings, Adam keeps saying he’s ‘in love with her’ and as the weeks grow the humble singer seems to gradually grow in confidence. But the bespectacled Massachusetts native still looked shocked when she discovered she was the first contestant to be saved from elimination by the voters. ‘It’s crazy, every single person on this show is so talented that my brain is just like ‘wait…what’s happening?’ She mumbled afterwards to host Christina Milian. ‘Michelle is a winner… it’s about connecting yourself to a real emotion and she does that,’ purred Usher, an eight-time Grammy winner and new judge for The Voice. Meanwhile lightly regarded four-piece Fall Out Boy dropped in to play the drum-heavy track My Songs from their new album. Talent scout: Perhaps the country favourite should give up music so he can find new acts . Piece of Swon cake: Jolly Blake ran up to his charges to congratulate them after the results were announced . Laurel and Hardy: The two jokers could only comfort each other after their high profile humiliation . Towards the end of the tune alternative music-lover Michelle jumped on stage to join in. In keeping with the show’s tradition for reeling in former contestants Team Ce Lo’s former student Nicholas David hit the stage. The heavily bearded dad of three, hailed as one of the most talented contestants from last season, played a soulful new tune, Say Goodbye. Then Tony Lucca, a Team Adam finalist from The Voice’s second season, played his soft rock single Never Gonna Let You Go. Wearing a bowler hat Tony was keen to praise the Overexposed rock star in boosting his music career. ‘Adam is a man of his word, he signed me to 222 Records and he’s taking me out with Maroon 5, we’re going to tour with them in September,’ he said, speaking of the lable that his former mentor runs. Specs appeal: Usher wore a pair of lucky glasses and they paid off as Michelle Chamuel romped through . Enjoying the show: Usher was then able to watch with detached amusement as his fellow mentors were put through the wringer . ‘We really vibed together and became really close really quickly,’ agreed the tattooed ‘metrosexual’ from the coaches panel. Before Amber and Sasha were guillotined the top five sang a final tune together – a muted version of Every Rose Has Its Thorn by glam metal band Poison. Scottish rocker Terry McDermott from Team Blake season three showed off his prolonged sideburns while singing his break-up ballad Pictures. 'I have pictures of Blake all over my mantle piece at home but I’ve been asked to take them down because they are inappropriate,’ he joked. Getting the acts together: They managed to overcome the fear of the chop to deliver a limp performance of Every Rose Has Its Thorn . Jock idol: Scottish rocker Terry McDermott delivered a Tartan Special performance of Pictures . ‘Every time I hear you sing I get excited,’ said Blake, grinning. The contestants and coaches were given a chance to mock the each other - leading to myriad jokes about Usher’s eccentric fashion taste and Blake’s southern-gent accent. Dressed up to imitate Usher Shakira pouted out one of his favourite mottos: ‘Luck favours the prepared.’ Adam Levine’s tattoos were also a hot topic for jest. ‘Adam’s tattoos are not real,’ said Blake. The two wallies: The Swon Brothers proved to be more Little and Large than Morcambe and Wise . Take that: Shakira will be disappointed to end in failure with no acts making it through to the grand finale . ‘I’ve seen him without the tattoos and he has a farmer’s tan,’ he laughed. ‘Well Blake has a tattoo of deer poop on a trail,’ shot back Adam in his defense. The Swon brothers giggled that Blake has a ‘laugh like Santa Claus’ but he got his own back by making them wear duplicates of Shakira’s skimpy cutaway leotard. 'Unless you are Shakira you’d have to be stupid to wear that,’ hooted the Nashville . crooner. Next week the contestants will battle it out to win the public’s heart in the season finale, where Christina Aguilera and Cher, 67, will be the special guest stars.

Mayor Bloomberg has painted an unsettling picture for New Yorkers, one where Hurricane Sandy was just a paltry beginning of what could be a city increasingly devastated by the effects of global warming. Following some startling figures released by city officials—that, for instance, by the 2050s, 800,000 people could be living in a flood zone that would cover a quarter of the land, with temperatures steadily rising—Bloomberg spoke Tuesday on the risks to New York City from future storms like Sandy. The mayor also took such discussions a step further by meeting, head on, the problem of a rapidly changing environment in New York City as a whole. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO... Even worse: Hurricane Sandy, which caused the biggest storm surge ever in NYC, was likely just the start of major and widespread climate change affects on New York according to fresh New York City and FEMA data . And with projections that local waters could within decades be a foot to 2.5 feet higher than they are today, which would leave 8 percent of the city's coastline flooding just from high tides, the mayor’s decision to speak out on the issue comes as no surprise. 'Piece by piece, over many years and even decades, we can build a city that's capable of preparing better, withstanding more and overcoming anything,' he said. Among Bloomberg's suggestions were for removable flood walls to be set up for much of lower Manhattan, a 15-to-20-foot levee to guard part of Staten Island, and a system of gates and levees to protect a Brooklyn creek. 'This plan is incredibly ambitious,' Bloomberg said of his proposed $20 billion plan. 'This is urgent work, and it must begin now.' Under water: Hurricane Sandy caused massive flooding in the New York area. New studies say to expect a lot more in the coming decades. Bloomberg has proposed a $20 plan to stem such disaster . Scary possibilities: Rising sea levels could push storm surges like the unprecedented one seen by Hurricane Sandy even higher. A map indicates the lower lying areas into which rising tides would flow. Bloomberg wants to build infrastructure to stop it . The recommendations drew from updated predictions from the New York City Panel on Climate Change, a scientists' group convened by the city. Updated numbers from 2009 data, which themselves looked grim, show equally shocking outcomes from climate change in New York...but the changes will come even sooner. By 2050, New Yorkers could expect: . Coastal water levels up to 1 to 2.5 feet higher. Which means 8 percent of the coastline could be flooded just from high tide. And 800,000 people could live within a 100-year-floodplain. The average day could be 4 to 7 degrees hotter. The temperature could be at or over 90 degrees Fahrenheit for some 57 days a year. The average day could be 4 degrees to nearly 7 degrees Fahrenheit hotter by mid-century, the panel estimates in data Pinsky and Holloway discussed Monday. A once-in-a-century storm would likely spur a surge 5 feet or more higher than did Sandy, which sent a record 14-foot storm tide gushing into lower Manhattan. City Hall, the state government and others have released warnings over the years about climate risks. The city has required some new developments in flood zones to be elevated and has restored wetlands as natural barriers, among other steps. ‘Sandy, obviously, increased the urgency of dealing with this and the need to plan and start to take concrete steps,’ Holloway said. The new projections echo 2009 estimates from the climate change panel, but the timeframe for some upper-end possibilities has moved up from the 2080s to mid-century. Soaked: Low-lying areas were especially hard hit by Sandy. City officials have now released data that such areas--up to 8 percent of the city--could be flooded just at high tide by 2050 . Preparation: 'Piece by piece, over many years and even decades, we can build a city that's capable of preparing better, withstanding more and overcoming anything,' said Mayor Bloomberg June 11 . ‘The overall numbers are similar, but . we have more compelling evidence now that (a more severe scenario from . 2009) is looking like a more realistic possibility now,’ due to improved . computer models and more evidence that some ice sheets are melting, . said Radley Horton, a climate scientist with Columbia University's Earth Institute and a researcher with the city climate panel. Meanwhile, the Federal Emergency . Management Agency released revisions Monday to proposed new flood zone . maps for the city. About 218,000 people and 35,000 buildings are in the . current once-in-100-year flood zone, drawn in the 1980s. Sooner than later: Bloomberg tours storm-ravaged Queens. The administration is now addressing fears of future vulnerabilities from storms and other weather due to newer, scarier climate change data . The new maps roughly double those numbers, though the revision shifts about 5,800 structures from a subset called the V zone - the area expected to suffer the worst damage - to a less stringent zone. A roughly two-year review is expected before new maps become official. Scientists have reached a consensus on global warming but still debate how severe the effects will be.","Waters could be 1 to 2.5 feet higher in New York City by 2050, according to updated data from city researchers .

Wallwork, 46, said: 'He's had the ponytail since he was a toddler, it . is natural to him. It would be like cutting someone's finger off. I've . spoken to the head and he says it's got to come off. 'They asked me if it is a . religious thing. It's not but it is what my son believes. 'It's all . right for girls but not for lads, it's infringement of human rights. 'No one else has complained about it, . he's not hurting anyone and it's not distracting him or anyone else in . lessons. If he had a pink Mohican I could understand it, but it's just a . small pony tail.' Unfair: The schoolboy's father insists making Connor learn at home breaches his human rights .

Gone With The Wind star Vivien Leigh was twice deemed unsuitable for a damehood – with her fragile mental health and scandalous affairs possible reasons for the snub. Two unidentified experts who were asked to consider Leigh’s suitability vetoed the honour when she was twice considered in 1952 and 1954. They deemed the actress – who had fallen for Sir Laurence Olivier when married, and also had an affair with actor Peter Finch – suitable only for a lower-ranking CBE. In the end she was not honoured at all. The comments are revealed in Cabinet Office papers obtained by this newspaper under Freedom of Information laws. It is not clear whether the individuals quoted were civil servants, politicians or other experts consulted as part of the honours process. One of the pair writes: ‘There are contrary opinions about her merits as an actress. 'Personally I think she is underrated, and see no reason why she should not have a CBE [Commander of the British Empire] but certainly not a DBE [Dame Commander of the British Empire].’ The other wrote: ‘I am a great admirer of Vivien Leigh as an actress both stage and film. ‘Apart from her gifts as an actress, she has won great public admiration for the courage with which she has in recent years faced illness. ‘Personally I doubt whether she is at present quite what may be called “The Dame Class”, eg Edith Evans, Sybil Thorndike. I, therefore, venture to express the view that CBE appears to be more appropriate than DBE.’ The star was 39 at the time of the first snub and was enjoying huge international acclaim for her performances in the film and stage versions of the Tennessee Williams classic A Streetcar Named Desire. But she had suffered from lifelong depression and had  previously taken an overdose on the set of Gone With The Wind in 1938 – the film in which Clark Gable as Rhett Butler famously told her: ‘Frankly, my dear, I don’t give a damn.’ In 1953 she went on to suffer a complete mental breakdown after having an affair with co-star Finch while filming Elephant Walk. She was replaced in her role by Elizabeth Taylor and admitted to a psychiatric hospital. Vivien Leigh curtseys to the Queen Mother at the Variety Club in 1954 next to husband Sir Laurence Olivier and Dame Sybil Thornduke . Leigh’s biographer Hugo Vickers believes that legendary actor Olivier could have been behind at least one snub. He said: ‘I think it quite possible that she was turned down because she was too beautiful and too feminine. She clearly didn’t fit the idea of a theatrical Dame at that time. ‘But these individuals would have been aware that she had health problems and that she had been married twice. Clearly these things still mattered in the Fifties. 'I just wonder if Olivier himself had any input into the matter, because he was such a powerful figure in the theatre world. 'He was jealous of her always and so beastly to her basically that he could easily have said, “I don’t think she would want such a thing.” ’ Mr Vickers said it is unlikely the actress, who was married to Olivier from 1940 to 1960, would have been aware of or bothered by the snub. The newly released papers also show . that the CBE bestowed on Lord Of The Flies author William Golding was . delayed for a year because officials sent a letter informing him of the . honour to the wrong address. And actor Dirk Bogarde was knighted in 1992 only because his career was almost over and that the honour was ‘overdue’. A . Downing Street memo dated July 12, 1965, and headed Honours – In . Confidence states: ‘William Golding will presumably remain on the list . for consideration and should, in my view, automatically, go into the . next list: it can hardly be held against him that we were not able to . deliver the letter offering his CBE in the birthday [honours] list.’ Leigh fell for Olivier, left, when she was already married - and cheated on Olivier with Peter Finch, right . Of Bogarde’s, one official notes the actor ‘is described by the British Film Institute as a legendary talent, he is now close to the end of his acting career. An honour is overdue’. The papers show that political affiliations appear regularly to have influenced decision-making behind honours. Labour Prime Minister James Callaghan blocked a CBE for the Right-wing author Kingsley Amis in the 1979 Honours List. A Downing Street minute dated November 20, 1978, reads: ‘The Prime Minister has given consideration to his recommendations for the New Year Honours List 1979. The Prime Minister does not wish to include Kingsley Amis.’ Amis was later knighted in 1990 when Tory Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister.","Leigh was considered for a damehood in 1952 and 1954 .

Montri told reporters the lions were shipped legally and were waiting to be transferred to a zoo in Thailand's northeast.

While the country is signed up to a convention regulating international trade in endangered species, Thai law does not extend protection to many alien species. Other species seized included baboons, tortoises, sugar gliders and peacocks.  Police also found a hornbill and a leopard, both protected by Thai law, which were packed in a box and were scheduled to be delivered to clients on Monday. The police spokesman said: 'We have been monitoring the location for a few days after the neighbors complained about the noise from the animals, and if you looked through the gate, you could spot lions in the cage.'

A television executive and his young daughter might have been saved if their speedboat’s ‘kill cord’ safety device had been properly used, it was claimed last night. Nick Milligan, 51, a doting father and senior Sky TV boss, and eight-year- old daughter Emily died when they were run over by the out-of-control powerboat. His yoga-teacher wife Victoria, 41, and their four-year-old son Kit both face losing their legs from ‘life-changing’ wounds caused by the £60,000 craft’s propeller. Scroll down for video . Nick Milligan and his eight-year-old daughter Emily (far left) were killed and the rest of the family - wife Victoria and children Amber, Olivia and Kit - are in hospital after being injured when they were thrown from their boat which then ran over them with its propeller . Their two other children, Amber, 12, and Olivia, ten, suffered less serious injuries in the Bank Holiday weekend horror in Padstow, Cornwall – where the London family owns a ‘dream’ holiday house. Mr Milligan’s brother Max paid emotional tribute to ‘an extremely loving father and husband, son and brother, who doted on his family’. Police said the death toll would have been ‘far worse’ but for heroic watersports instructor Charlie Toogood, who risked his life to leap into the runaway powerboat from another boat, and stop its engine. 'Coastguards praised his ‘incredible seamanship and bravery’. The family of six were flung into the water as their 300-horsepower Cobra boat spun out of control in the Camel Estuary half a mile from land at 3.50pm on Sunday. Hundreds of holidaymakers watched in horror as the empty craft raced round in circles, its propellers slashing the helpless victims and turning the water ‘red with blood’. Padstow harbourmaster Rob Atkinson suggested the disaster could have been averted if the boat’s ‘kill cord’ – a device which shuts down the engine if the skipper goes overboard – had been used. Father: BSkyB executive Nicholas Milligan, 51, has been named as the man who was killed by a runaway speedboat in Padstow yesterday . Photographs of the speedboat being taken away by Coastguards showed the kill cord still in place, apparently unused. It . is supposed to be attached to the skipper’s leg and operates . as a ‘dead man’s handle’, effectively yanking out the ignition key and . cutting the throttle if the helmsman is thrown from the craft. Mr . Atkinson said: ‘Please, please, please, when you have a boat fitted . with a kill cord, make sure the kill cord is operating correctly and . make sure it is attached to you because if you go out of the boat, it . will stop the engine and it will prevent tragedies like this happening.’ Police said the kill cord – and whether or not it had been used – was a ‘key focus’ of their investigation. TV executive Mr Milligan – a co-founder of Channel 5 who went on to become the managing director of Sky Media – built a dream beach house a few years ago in Trebetherick, which is on the other side  of the estuary from Padstow, said his brother. Mr Milligan described it in 2011 as his ‘most treasured possession’. Witness Simon Lewins, from Wadebridge, said: ‘We saw a boat coming up the estuary and it seemed to take a right turn. As it took the turn it flopped and the people in the boat went out in the water and then the boat went round in circles and it seemed to come back into the group on three or four occasions. ‘We heard screaming and saw seagulls coming into the water, it wasn’t good. ‘As this happens the boat was taking ever-decreasing circles with nobody in it because they were all in the water and it was slowing and it kept going for ten, 15 minutes.’ Aftermath: An amateur video showing the empty speedboat out of control at Padstow shortly after the fatal incident . Danger: The boat was completely out of control following the incident in Padstow, Cornwall, on Bank Holiday Sunday . Bravery: The video, filmed from the shore, shows Mr Toogood jumping on to the speedboat . Padstow resident Martin Jenkins, 63, added: ‘It looked terrible. The water was filled with blood like a horror film.’ Three RNLI lifeboats were sent to the scene as well as search and rescue helicopters. The four survivors of the accident were flown to Derriford hospital in Plymouth. Detective Superintendent Jim Colwell, of Devon and Cornwall Police, thanked members of the public including a kayaker who had tried to protect the stricken  family from the circling powerboat, adding: ‘Everyone’s assistance undoubtedly saved lives.’ He said six life jackets had been recovered from the scene of the tragedy. He would not say whether they had been worn or not. He said the mother and son had received ‘serious leg injuries which may result in life-changing implications’. The two older daughters were said to be ‘recovering well’. About 25 police officers have been assigned to the investigation into the accident, and are preparing reports for the local coroner. Speedboats are common sights around the harbour area in the popular tourist destination, nicknamed ‘Padstein’ because it is the home of celebrity chef Rick Stein. He tweeted: ‘Our thoughts are with the injured and bereaved involved in the tragic accident.’","Nick Milligan, 51, who worked for BSkyB, died with daughter Emily, eight .

Naki'o was left abandoned at a foreclosed Nebraska home when he was a young and was found alone, frozen into a puddle of icy water in the cellar . Naki'o is the first dog to be fitted with a complete set of bionic paws that work naturally to allow him to run, jump and even swim . It was a tough existence for Naki’o, he couldn’t walk and play with other dogs due to the pain it caused him and instead had to crawl along on his belly. Fortunately for Naki'o he meet veterinarian assistant Christie Pace of Colorado Springs, Colo. who was looking for an animal she could help. ‘I have a soft spot for rescue animals in general. I was looking for something different, unique. I wanted to make more of a difference than a regular dog. I knew I could help him out,’ she told ABC. She adopted Naki’o when he was 8-weeks-old and then set about organizing a fundraiser to pay for him to have his two back legs fitted with prosthetics. Christie adopted Naki¿o when he was 8-weeks-old and set about organizing a fundraiser to pay for him to have his prosthetics . He took to these so enthusiastically, that the company who fitted them decided to complete the process free of charge. ‘When we saw how good he was doing with his back leg prosthetics and how he was struggling to use his front legs it was very simple to say, “we gotta keep with him.” He could do much better with all four prosthetics on,’ said Martin Kaufmann, owner of Orthopets, a Denver company that specializes in pet prosthetics. Naki'o is the first dog to be fitted with a complete set of bionic paws that work naturally to allow him to run, jump and even swim. At first walking on all four prosthetics was challenging, but Naki’o adapted quickly, learning how to use the devices as though they were his natural legs. New lease of life: Naki’o’s devices are made with mountain bike tires . Naki'o was taken to an animal rescue center and under their care his paws healed to rounded stumps . After just a few days he was running and bounding along. The prosthetics are built to mimic the muscle and bone of dog limbs, allowing them to do everything a normal dog would do. Christie is amazed at her pet’s motivation and joy for life. 'Naki’o can now not only chase after a ball with other dogs, but he can beat them to the catch!' In recent years, veterinarian medicine has advanced by leaps – with not just braces and prosthetics, but also implants - metal rods fused to the animals' own bone and then attached to an artificial paw. One prosthetic can however cost anywhere from $1,000 to $3,000.

Father's Day is approaching. A time to celebrate the huge contribution made to family life by the nation's dads. A special moment of the year to say thanks for all the sacrifices made, for the hard work, for the long hours of parenthood freely given but rarely acknowledged. An opportunity to salute the simple, quiet nobility of being a father. Or to put it another way. To run the dad-flag up the dad-pole in the kingdom of dad-dom. Somebody's got to do it! For somehow, in both big and small ways, in unwitting behaviours that corrode society, fathers and fatherhood have become a laughing stock. In a new study, parents have criticised what is being labelled as Homer Simpson Syndrome; the endless casual contempt shown to fathers depicted on television programmes and in advertising, particularly in the messages and entertainment aimed at children. A Netmums survey released this week revealed growing dissatisfaction and alarm at the way fathers are routinely portrayed as bungling fools and worse. The report singled out Peppa Pig's unshaven, overweight and hopeless father, Daddy Pig; bad role model Fred Flintstone of the Bedrock community; and of course perennial loser Homer Simpson as particularly damaging to children's perception of fatherhood. One can see their point. Daddy Pig is called fat by his daughter. He cannot read without his glasses and cannot map read at all. Idiot! On a trip to the supermarket, he defies perfect, health-conscious Mummy Pig by sneaking a chocolate cake into the trolley. Oink, oink! When Daddy takes them to his office, the kids are not impressed by his job. There are even moments when Peppa seems to favour her little brother George over her daddy. Meanwhile, The Flintstones' Fred Flintstone deludes himself that it is he, not wife Wilma, who is king of the family cave. He loses his temper easily, loves lounging around the cave in his underpants and has a gambling problem. Homer Simpson. Where do we start?  Homer has many failings, but is generally depicted as a dad who has the brainpower of a gnat. He also eats too many doughnuts, drinks too many beers and is generally a bad influence on his kids. Yes, of course it is only meant as fun, with scriptwriters wringing out every last laugh from a juicy comic stereotype - but millions and millions of children watch and absorb these calamity dad-escapades without having the sophistication or the ability to contextualise these imaginary adventures. And not everyone can see the joke. Boys night out: Archetypal bad father Fred Flintstone with best mate Barney Rubble, and Daddy Pig (right), who is fat, cannot read and is, in short, an idiot . An overwhelming 93 per cent of mums and dads who took part in the Netmums poll said that the way fathers appear on television, as well as in books and on adverts, bears no relation to their real-life contribution to family life. More than half agreed society was becoming 'more appreciative of how important a dad's role is' and that fathers are 'much closer to their kids than in the past'. Nine in ten dads said they felt they were working harder than their own fathers to be a good parent. Two-thirds said they were proud to work harder to support their family and a similar proportion are 'happier and more settled' than before they had children. Despite all their efforts, however, dads have to sit back and watch themselves being endlessly lampooned on television as not much more than lazy sperm donors. Half of them complained that too many families on television were either shown with feckless fathers - or with no father figures in sight at all. The insidious message that men are witless and pointless, mere playthings to be stamped on by the entire family is broadcast over and over again. This seems not only unfair, but quite extraordinary. At a time when there is a real need for strong, male role models, fathers are undermined to such an extent that they are often regarded as amusing appendages of no real use to the family. Perhaps even as a luxury - or a hindrance - that mum can do without. Is this just a harmless jest? Or a form of discrimination and on-screen bullying that mothers would not accept - not for one minute! - if it was routinely applied to them. To be fair, at least Daddy Pig, Fred Flintstone and Homer have some virtues. Despite their faults, they are all loving fathers and faithful husbands. They all have jobs, too. And whether at the architect's office, the Slate Rock And Gravel Company or the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, they are family providers who - literally in one case - bring home the bacon. They might be a few rashers short every week, but they are trying their best. Yet their ineptitude is unrelenting. At home it is always the mother figure - long-suffering Mummy Pig, Wilma or Marge - who gallop to the rescue to fix everything he messes up. The more this image takes hold, the more the role of the father in the family unit is marginalised and the more hurtful this will be to society. For academic studies repeatedly show that children with involved fathers do far better at school, have a much lower chance of getting involved in crime and have better mental health. So shouldn't we be celebrating and encouraging what dads do, instead of mocking them as useless twits who can't change a nappy, mop a floor or unload the dishwasher without causing a tsunami of chaos? Useless dads are not confined to the simple storylines of children's television, either. Father figures: A record 227,000 men were classed as stay-at-home fathers last year according to the Office for National Statistics . Telly adverts must shoulder their share of the blame. We're all familiar with the annual Christmas advertising campaigns - the ones from Boots in particular - that depict mothers as the only members of the family who are competent and organised enough to arrange the festivities, right down to the Sellotape and the stuffing. Few adverts show fathers in charge of the home front, keeping calm and carrying on. Sometimes it gets too much. Last year, a group of fathers in America forced Huggies to withdraw a campaign for their disposable nappies. The dads were outraged at being depicted as 'clueless' or too busy watching football to check their babies. It was the dads, not the nappies, who were being put on trial. There is no escape from the bad dad. Television sit-coms on both sides of the Atlantic are stuffed with men behaving badly. Good parenting: Nine in ten dads who responded to the survey said they felt they were working harder than their own fathers to be a good parent . In My Family, one of the longest running series on the BBC, grumpy, hapless Ben (Robert Lindsay) was bossed about by his wife (Zoe Wanamaker), regularly fleeced for money by his kids and always outfoxed in his perennial bid to relax on the sofa at home. Outnumbered shows dad Pete outsmarted by his three kids, while Shameless father-of-six Frank Gallagher is an ex-convict unemployed alcoholic prone to drunken rants. Modern Family's Phil Dunphy is always leading his family straight towards the jaws of calamity ('What's the plan, Phil?') while shows such as Malcolm In The Middle and Everybody Loves Raymond also feature dads of spectacular incompetence. Meanwhile, who is the doofus under the roofus of Downton Abbey? Need you ask. Adrift amongst a family of strong, powerful and scheming woman, it is daffy Lord Grantham (Hugh Bonneville) who is hapless enough to have lost the family fortune, snogged the maid in a cupboard and is unable to put a jacket on or brush the dandruff off his shoulders without help. All is not fair with dads on the family front. The point is, many of the jokes aimed at fathers would be banned if they were aimed at women, ethnic minorities or religious groups. It seems hardly just; particularly as so many dads are devoted, hardworking and would do anything for their families. Back in the Fifties, fathers were always the authority figure, the head of the tribe. In comparison, today's dads are demonised and sidelined just too much - yes, even you, Homer Simpson. And particularly on Father's Day, their day of days, can they expect to be properly honoured instead of being treated as an under-appreciated resource in the family, rather like a hat stand in the hallway during summer? Yes they can. Because industry statistics show that it is mothers who usually purchase gifts and cards on behalf of the children.

Andrew Woodhouse has been charged with GBH after he says he fought off suspected thieves who were raiding his premises . A businessman who confronted suspected burglars raiding his premises at night could be jailed after he grabbed one of the gang’s weapons and used it to fight back. Andrew Woodhouse, 43, claims he was chasing thieves off his property when one of them ‘came at’ him with a wooden stick. In the scuffle, he managed to grab the stick and used it to injure the man’s legs before holding him down and screaming at his wife to call the police. After a series of burglaries at his paving firm in Abergavenny, South Wales, Mr Woodhouse thought he might finally have helped to bring one of the robbers to justice. But then police arrested Mr Woodhouse as well and held him in a cell for 18 hours. He has been charged with grievous bodily harm with intent and will appear before magistrates on Thursday, along with the two men he apprehended. ‘I was scared. It was pitch dark, they had hoods on and I was getting hit,’ the father of five said last night. ‘I can’t see what else I could have done. I thought it was a man’s right to protect his property. I’ll fight to clear my name.’ While the law was changed a few months ago to protect those who use force against burglars, the rules apply only at home, not if thieves are chased outside. Mr Woodhouse’s case has led to calls for the Crown Prosecution Service to show ‘common sense’ in dealing with those who defend themselves outside, with MPs calling the decision to prosecute him ‘astonishing’. If found guilty, he could face a sentence of life imprisonment. Mr Woodhouse was in bed with his wife . Lisa at their detached home in the village of Govilon when his burglar . alarm went off at about 12.30am. The alarm is fitted to his business . premises on an industrial estate a mile from his six-bedroom £350,000 . home. He drove to the . estate, where he saw two men trying to steal diesel from the engines of . his fleet of vehicles. His wife, 42, said: ‘He shouted at them to stop . and when they turned and ran he chased them. Mr Woodhouse was in bed with his wife at their home in Govilon, pictured, when the burglar alarm sounded to say his business premises one mile away had been broken into . ‘One of them turned and faced Andrew. He was holding a stick. Andrew defended himself, he grabbed the stick off the bloke and whacked him with it. ‘The fellow was on the floor screaming at him. It all happened so quick, it was dark, I’m not sure anyone knew what was really going on.’ As Mr Woodhouse held Kevin Green, 52, the other alleged burglar, Timothy Cross, 31, is said to have returned with a third man, both carrying planks. Mrs Woodhouse had, by this time, also driven to the scene. She said: ‘When I got there Andrew was chasing one of the chaps. He saw me and shouted, “Get the police, get the police”. Monmouth MP David Davies said he would raise the issue in Parliament . ‘The police arrived and Andrew admitted he’d whacked the chap with the stick. The police said he had two broken legs and a broken wrist. They arrested Andrew and took him into custody. I didn’t see him until 6pm the next day.’ Police charged Mr Woodhouse with causing grievous bodily harm with intent because he used ‘unreasonable’ force. His wife said: ‘I fail to see where there was any intent on Andrew’s part. He didn’t intend to get up in the middle of the night to assault anyone. All he did was protect his property. ‘People may think he took the law into his own hands but what was he supposed to do, stand by and watch?’ Mr Woodhouse employs six staff including two of his sons at the family business, which was set up 20 years ago. The firm has lost £15,000 in recent years to thefts of diesel and tools. There is much support for him locally. He claims to have collected about 50 character references, including ones from a policeman and a priest. MPs are calling on the CPS to drop the case against Mr Woodhouse and his local MP, Tory David Davies, said he would raise the issue in Parliament. ‘If someone came at him with a piece of wood, my sympathy is with the hard-working businessman, not with the people breaking into his property,’ he added. Gwent Police said the 52-year-old man arrested at the scene had been taken to hospital with ‘serious leg and arm injuries’. A spokesman added that the decision to charge Mr Woodhouse was taken after CPS advice.

An end-of-exams party held at a £1million country house descended into a riot when 150 gatecrashers turned up after reading about it on Facebook. Jacob Little, 17, posted a private invitation to the event on the social networking site – expecting only his friends to turn up. What was supposed to be a private gathering soon descended into chaos, with unwelcome guests turning up in droves. His parents, who were on holiday, had given their son permission to host a small celebration at their house in Copthorne, Surrey. A party organised via Facebook turned into 'a riot' at a secluded guest house after 150 gatecrashers turned up . Police - reportedly armed with tasers and batons - tried to contain a mob of teenagers at the party as it descended into chaos . The . teenager who organised the private party admitted it had 'just got out . of hand' while one reveller compared the chaos the night descended into . as 'just like Project X' - a comedy film about a debauched teen house . party. A police helicopter was scrambled along with cars, dog handlers and officers armed with batons and tasers as they struggled to bring the party - believed to have been organised to celebrate the end of GCSE exams - under control. Missiles were hurled at officers and several police cars were damaged, and a female officer also had to be treated by paramedics after she was injured in the fray. It is believed neighbours had called police after becoming concerned at the volume and the growing numbers of guests. Jacob Little said: 'The Facebook group that I set up to invite people was set to private, which, to be honest, I thought would be fine to make sure only people I wanted there came. 'But it was gate-crashed by people I didn't know. The police said that people were here from as far away as Guildford, but people from Crawley were here too, which was weird because most of the people that I invited were college friends from Haywards Heath.' The student added: 'From what I have heard the people who gate-crashed were bottling people (police) and chanting songs. 'People were standing in the road at the front of the house and calling up other people to invite others to come. 'It just got out of hand and when police arrived I was told to get everyone I wanted to stay, inside the house.' Jacob's parents were abroad in Poland at the time on holiday when the party was held, with their permission, at the large property.

A police helicopter was scrambled along with cars, dog handlers and officers as they struggled to bring the party - believed to have been organised to celebrate the end of GCSE exams - under control . Police were called in by Jacob's . furious father, Tony Little, who telephoned from Poland after a . neighbour he had asked to keep an eye on the property alerted him to . what was going on. One of the 17-year-olds who attended the party said he found out via Facebook. He said: 'It was bad. There wasn’t any trouble until the police turned up. Then people kicked off and it all got out of hand. 'There were probably about 30 police cars and  a couple of people got bitten by dogs. Then the helicopter turned up. 'The police came about 11pm but the riot was still going on until 2am. 'We had a mate who wasn’t drinking so was driving, but we couldn’t get out of the house and back on the lane to get to his car. 'People were throwing bottles. We had to hide under a table out of the way. It was bad.

When the MailOnline contacted the . house - owned by Sally Smyth and Tony Little - someone claiming to be Ms . Smyth's son said they 'were still away'. He . insisted it had not been his party but added: 'My parents are still . away. You have no idea how much damage this is causing us.' A Surrey Police spokesman said three arrests had been made and they were still appealing for witnesses. Some of the party goers claim they were bitten by police dogs during the riot - which reportedly continued for three hours . The party was held at a guest house which was used for Gatwick airport passengers in Domewood, a private estate on the Surrey and West Sussex borders . Inspector Paul Grove, said: 'This . incident demonstrates the dangers which police officers face on a daily . basis and a full investigation will now follow to find those responsible . for the disturbance in a bid to bring them to justice. 'Surrey . Police will not tolerate such violent behaviour against officers and . members of the public and thankfully no-one was seriously injured. 'I would urge anyone who has information on this incident to contact . officers and any information passed to us will be treated in the . strictest of confidence.'

But in the parrot world, it may be a way of striking up a conversation. Scientists believe that parakeets found in the Costa Rican forests mimic each other to begin 'discussions' about creating new flocks and who will be boss. 'Discussions': Scientists believe orange-fronted parakeets mimic fellow birds to initiate 'conversations' The theory comes from a study of orange-fronted parakeets that live in constantly changing flocks. University of Copenhagen researchers showed that the birds, which are green with orange foreheads, are more likely to respond to a call that sounds like their own. They also reply more quickly. This suggests that mimicry is used to initiate 'conversations', the journal PLoS ONE reports. In the wild, these may be negotiations on the joining and merging of flocks. Males may also use the process to establish the pecking order of the new flock, with the willing mimic perhaps more likely to be sub-ordinate. Researcher Thorsten Balsby said: 'It might mean a negotiation on dominance and who is going to lead the fused flock.' Mimicry: The orange fronted parakeets are found in the forests of Costa Rica . Dr Balsby believes that some other species of parrot use mimicry for a similar purpose. However, parrot owners should take note. The . researcher says that as pet birds are usually taught the sounds they . mimic, any speech cannot be taken as an attempt to initiate conversation . with their owner. And . while orange-fronted parakeets excel at mimicking members of their own . species, they are poor at replicating the human voice.","Researchers studied parakeets that live in constantly changing flocks in Costa Rican forests .

"By . Keeba Roy . PUBLISHED: . 16:57 EST, 8 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:21 EST, 8 June 2013 . From the great Italian painter Leonardo da Vinci to the science-fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke, history is packed with great visionaries who have obsessed over what life will be like in the future. These thinkers, with varying degrees of success, have tried to envisage such matters as how our modes of transport, means of communication and homes will look in years to come. Bristol architect Andrew Kenyon joined this long line of visionaries when, back in the early 1990s, he entered a competition to design a house for the future. Bright idea: The prize-winning property, on the market for £345,000, was constructed to reflect what future dwellings would look like . His glass-and-timber design triumphed and the house was built in a quiet cul-de-sac in the town of Cumbernauld between Glasgow and Edinburgh. Fifteen or so years later, the decision of the competition’s judges seems vindicated. The house, which stands amid rows of typical  suburban houses in Scotland’s central belt,  still resembles a home fit for the future. ‘We fell in love with it because it was different,’ says Stevie Pazikas, 51 – who with his partner, childcare assessor Karen Hillis, 45 – has lived in the house since buying it in 2008. They have now decided to downsize to concentrate on his electrical-contractor business, and the property is on the market for offers in the region of £345,000. The dominating feature of the house is its glass atrium. Besides the clear aesthetic value of this vast structure, Kenyon obviously realised that energy conservation would be a key concern for people in years ahead and designed this section with that in mind. Open air: The atrium in the house, located between Glasgow and Edinburgh, has a glass ceiling and a staircase leading to the mezzanine home office . The air in the atrium is warmed by the sun, so the whole house can be heated by opening the doors adjoining this space, and there are vents in the glass roof to help control the temperature. Thanks to this – plus the facts that the hot water pipes run under the floor and the  walls are very well-insulated – Stevie and Karen’s heating bills are well below average for this area. In keeping with the sustainability theme, all the timber in the house came from managed forests and the pond in the garden is filled with rainwater that is collected from the roof. Stevie has used his background as an electrical engineer to install a coloured lighting system so that the atrium is not just an impressive feature in the day. ‘The house takes on a completely different personality at night: it becomes soothing and calming and has almost a gothic castle feel,’ says Karen. Besides this, the couple have done little to the house in the five years they have lived there, leaving Kenyon’s vision to live up to its futuristic promise. They did, however, find the interiors were ‘a little twee’ when they bought it. ‘Curtains were hiding the woodwork and brickwork and rugs were hiding the beautiful Amtico flooring,’ says Karen. ‘We felt it needed updating to suit the architectural aspects of the house and its features, such as its high windows and ceilings.’ Time to downsize: Mr Stevie Pazikas and Miss Karen Hillis in their home in Cumbernauld, which they have decided to sell for business reasons . They say it is an ideal dwelling for social occasions with one side – which they jokingly refer to as the ‘West Wing’ – containing three bedrooms and two bathrooms, while the rest of the property includes a variety of living areas from a dine-in kitchen to a home office, which sits on a mezzanine level. ‘It is a great house for parties, especially in the summer when you can fold back the glass wall in the atrium and allow your guests access to the garden,’ says Karen. And while their house may stand out from the rest in the area, the couple feel part of a warm community. ‘We have a great social life here.’ says Stevie. ‘Our neighbours have become friends and we often get together for dinner.’ The house is also ideal for golf enthusiasts as it is situated in the middle of the Seve Ballesteros-designed Westerwood course. Prospective buyers will also be interested to learn of the merits of Cumbernauld, which is a mere 25-minute drive from Glasgow and, with its range of shops, restaurants and theatre, has plenty to offer in its own right. Katrina Maxwell of selling agents K Property says: ‘This is an exceptional, award-winning home set in the heart of Westerwood. ‘It must be viewed to be fully appreciated.’ lk-property.co.uk, 01236 455110 .","Award winning futuristic home on the market for £345,000 .

Tragic: Marlene Blakey, 68, was killed in Newcastle when a single decker bus careered across the road and smashed into the bus stop she was stood at. It is alleged the driver fell asleep at the wheel . A church-going pensioner was killed after a bus driver careered onto the wrong side of the road and crashed into her after falling asleep at the wheel, a court has heard. Stagecoach driver Robert Faichen, 54, had been suffering from undiagnosed sleep apnoea and was not 'with it' when he ploughed into Marlene Blakey, 68. The pensioner had just attended a morning service at Prudhoe Street Mission in Newcastle when the single . decker bus hit her from . behind while she waited for a bus. Ms Blakey was rushed to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle but later died of injuries to her chest and pelvis. Faichen, of Blakelaw, Newcastle, was arrested and charged and has pleaded not guilty to causing death by careless driving. Michael Hodson, prosecuting, told his trial at Newcastle Crown Court yesterday: 'The bus veered across the road into first the car lane and then into the opposite lane and collided with Marlene Blakey, a 68-year-old woman who was waiting for her bus. 'The crown say each driver, including the stagecoach bus driver who is the defendant in this case, has a responsibility to come to the road fit to drive with no impairment to his skills that he knows of that may endanger people. 'This defendant had a problem with sleeping at the time of this incident. 'He got two and a half to five hours sleep on average. This makes him prone to being sleepy during the day which he is aware.' Jurors heard yesterday how after he was arrested, Faichen told police of his sleeping problems, saying that on average he would sleep between two and a half and five hours a night, interrupted by four to five visits to the toilet. Accused: Bus driver Robert Faichen, 54, pictured, allegedly killed church going pensioner Marlene Blakey at a bus stop in Newcastle after falling asleep at the wheel , a court has heard . Collision: The pensioner had just attended a morning service at Prudhoe Street Mission in Newcastle when the single decker bus hit her from behind on Westgate Road, pictured . The prosecution claim that Faichen’s sleeping problems were worsened on the night before the accident by his drinking, whereby he consumed three pints and a double brandy, causing him to be abnormally tired on the day of the accident. They also claim that if Faichen had informed his employers of his health problems they would have stopped him driving and the tragedy, which happened on December 4, 2011, would have been avoided. Sleep apnoea is characterised by pauses in breathing or moments of very low breathing during sleep. Each pause in breathing can last for about ten seconds to minutes and in some cases can occur five to 30 times within an hour. Those who suffer with sleep apnoea are not usually aware of having problems with breathing, even when they wake up. Sufferers can become fatigued during the day, have slow reaction times and vision problems. Treatment can often begin with behavioural therapy. Doctors often tell patients to avoid alcohol, sleeping pills, and other sedatives. The onset of sleep apnoea is most common in people aged 35 to 54. However, it can affect people of all ages. It is estimated that around 4 per cent of middle-aged men and 2 per cent of middle-aged women suffer from the condition. Newcastle Crown Court heard that during his police interview, Faichen admitted to on occasion falling asleep during the day 'within minutes'. After the accident, he was diagnosed with sleep apnoea, a condition in which the sufferer can stop breathing for short periods during sleep, causing them to repeatedly wake throughout the night. Mr Hodson continued: 'Being sleepy is a normal condition. It’s self preservation because being sleepy gives us notice that we need to find a place of safety. 'Sleep does not overcome us unexpectedly or suddenly or we would would be falling about in the streets. 'If he had talked to his employers and told them how he was, do you not think they would have stopped him driving? 'The defendant had been suffering from significant periods of sleepiness. 'He drove passengers in a bus at that time knowing that he was in danger of becoming drowsy, having to fight his drowsiness and perhaps falling asleep.' Witness statements from passengers told how Faichen had 'not looked right' and had 'looked blank' as they boarded the bus. Eye witnesses told how the bus had drifted in a 'gradual curve' across the road before hitting Ms Blakey. The trial continues.

A giant lizard that lived up to 40 million years ago in the hot tropical forests of Southeast Asia has been named after The Doors' frontman Jim Morrison. The 'lizard king' dubbed Barbaturex morrisoni was six-foot long and weighed around 68 pounds - more than an average nine-year-old boy - and is thought to be one of the biggest known lizards ever to have lived on land. Scientists from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln christened the lizard after Morrison because he was known as the Lizard King, taken from his famous lyric ‘I am the lizard king, I can do anything' from the 1970 musical and poetry piece Celebration of the Lizard. This artist's impression shows Barbatuex Morrisoni, which means 'Morrison's bearded king'. It was named after Jim Morrison, the singer of The Doors whose nickname was the Lizard King. This giant lizard roamed the tropical forests of Asia up to 40 million years ago and is believed to be one of the biggest known lizards ever to have lived on land. The lizard provides important clues about the evolution of plant-eating reptiles . American singer Jim Morrison was the frontman for band The Doors in the 1970s. His nickname was the Lizard King, taken from a lyric in the musical and poetry piece Celebration of the Lizard. This was the inspiration for the scientists at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln when choosing a name for a lizard that lived up to 40 million years ago. The scientists have been studying fossils of the lizard discovered in Burma to learn more about the mammal and the time in which it lived . The Barbaturex morrisoni lizard lived between 36 and 40 million years ago in Southeast Asia. Fossils of the giant lizard were originally discovered in Myanmar in Burma scientists from University of Iowa and Duke University in the 1970s. Paleontologists from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln have only recently began studying them. The jaw of Barbaturex morrisoni had ridges along the inside of its mouth that suggest the animal may have a had a skin flap in its throat. This suggests that the lizard was a plant-eater. It is thought to have been around six-foot long from nose to tail. And scientists believe it would have weighed about 68 pounds. The lizard is thought to have resembled modern-day bearded dragons, but around six times the size. It also had bones that are characteristic of chameleons and spiny-tailed lizards. The giant lizard's genus name Barbaturex means 'bearded king.' Barbaturex morrisoni was bigger than most of the mammals it would have lived with. This lack of predators and competitors meant it could grow bigger than other mammals. Dr Jason Head, an assistant professor of Earth and Atmospheric sciences at UNL and a . curator in the University of Nebraska State Museum of Natural History's . Division of Vertebrate Paleontology studied the fossils. Head worked with Patricia Holroyd of University of California at . Berkeley, Gregg Gunnell of Duke University, and Russell Ciochon of the . University of Iowa on identifying and analysing the lizard. Ciochon originally found the lizard's fossils in Myanmar, Burma in the 1970s. But paleontologists from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln only began studying them recently. The discovery provides important new clues on the evolution of plant-eating . reptiles. Barbaturex morrisoni was a herbivore . but would have lived among both plant and meat-eating mammals around 36 . to 40 millions years ago. Dr Head first noticed the creature's bones were characteristic of a group of . modern lizards that includes bearded dragons, chameleons and plant . eaters like spiny-tailed lizards. The jaw of the Barbaturex morrisoni had ridges along the inside of its mouth that suggest the animal may have a had a skin flap in its throat. This suggests that the lizard was a plant-eater. It is thought to have been around six-foot long from nose to tail . weighed about 68 pounds . He said: 'I thought 'that's neat. Based on its teeth, it's a plant-eating lizard from a time period and a . place from which we don't have a lot of information.' 'But when I . started studying its modern relatives I realised just how big this . lizard was. 'It struck me we had something here that was quite large - . and quite unique.' He also noticed ridges on the underside of the jaw . that strongly suggested the lizard supported soft tissues, much like the . multicolored chin flaps and dewlaps that give some modern lizards a . bearded appearance. The Barbaturex morrisoni would have therefore resembled a modern-day bearded dragon, but at six times the size. Asked about his decision to name the lizard after Jim Morrison, Dr Head added: 'I was listening to The Doors quite a bit during the research. 'Some . of their musical imagery includes reptiles and ancient places - and Jim . Morrison was of course The Lizard King - so it all kind of came . together.' Jason Head from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln holds a fossil and fossil cast from the jawbone of Barbaturex morrisoni, a giant ancient lizard named after The Doors musician Jim Morrison. On either side of Head are a mounted sailfin lizard that was closely related to Barbaturex and a skeleton of a modern plant-eating iguana . In modern-day environments plant-eating lizards such as iguanas and agamids are much smaller than large mammal herbivores. The largest lizards, such as the giant, carnivorous Komodo Dragon, are . limited to islands that are light on mammal predators. Dr Head said it's not known if lizards are limited in size by competition with mammals or by temperatures of modern climates. 'You can't fully understand . the evolution of ecosystems in the modern world without looking at the . ones that preceded them. 'We would've never known this by looking at lizards today. The Barbaturex morrisoni would have resembled a modern-day bearded dragon, pictured left, because of chin flaps and its shape, but is thought to have been six times the size. The name Barbaturex morrisoni also means 'Morrison's bearded king'. Ridges in the Barbaturex morrisoni's mouth suggest it was a plant-eater like the iguana, pictured right . 'By going back in time using the fossil record, we can find unique information on the origin of modern ecosystems.'

The disgraced former head of the International Monetary Fund was on the red carpet at Cannes with new companion, Myriam L’Aouffir. It was confirmation that the pair are together, following his split last year from his long-suffering wife of 20 years, Anne Sinclair. Unveiled: Former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn and Myriam L'Aouffir pose on the red carpet as they arrive for a screening in Cannes . Movie date: The couple attended a screening of 'Plein Soleil' during the Cannes Film Festival . The pair were rumoured last September to have started dating but this appearance appeared to be the first public confirmation. They attended  the screening of a French film, Full Sun, starring veteran actor Alain Delon. At 43 years-old, Miss L’Aouffir is 20 years younger than her infamous economist boyfriend. Like Mr Strauss-Kahn, she comes from a Moroccan background, and is also believed to be estranged from her husband, with whom she has two children. She works in marketing. Strauss-Kahn faced a series of accusations over sexual abuse and pimping . Mr Strauss-Kahn last December agreed a financial settlement with the hotel maid whose 2011 allegation of sexual assault forced him to resign from the International Monetary Fund. Strauss-Kahn - once tipped as a Socialist French president - was accused of trying to rape chambermaid Nafissatou Diallo at a Sofitel Hotel in New York. After being held in the city’s notorious Rikers Island prison, criminal charges were dropped. He then returned to France last year only to face accusations of sexually abusing a young French writer. French judges agreed there was a case against Strauss-Kahn, but had to drop it because the alleged attack happened more than a decade ago. Strauss-Kahn was then charged with conspiring with pimps in Lille, northern France, to procure girls for sex parties around the world. His interest in movies may be soon tested however. A film starring Jacqueline Bisset - who plays his former wife - and Gerard Depardieu as Mr Strauss-Kahn which recreates the drama around the 2011 incident is expected to be released later this year. Mr Strauss-Kahn’s New York arrest ultimately destroyed his ambitions for the French presidency. A gifted orator, fluent in English and German, the silver-haired high-flier had been seen as a likely challenger to president Nicolas Sarkozy in the 2012 election, won by Francois Hollande. Common heritage: Like Mr Strauss-Kahn, Miss L'Aouffir comes from a Moroccan background and is also believed to be estranged from her husband . Probes: As well as two sex abuse allegations, he was also accused of conspiring with pimps . Dominique Strauss-Kahn is split from his wife, Anne Sinclair.

Astronomers in the Netherlands have, for the first time, observed a comet factory around a young star. Particles around the young star grow by clumping together, solving a long-standing mystery about how dust particles in discs form comets or planets. The ‘dust trap’ was found by Nienke van der Marel, a PhD student at Leiden Observatory using the new Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). This artist's impression shows the dust trap in the system Oph-IRS 48. The dust trap provides a safe haven for the tiny rocks in the disc, allowing them to clump together and grow to sizes that allow them to survive on their own . Earlier observations using ESO’s Very Large Telescope had already shown that the small dust particles also form a similar ring structure. But the ALMA view of where the larger dust particles were found was very different. ‘At first, the shape of the dust in the image was a complete surprise for us,’ said van der Marel. ‘Instead of the ring we had expected to see, we found a very clear cashew-nut shape. 'We had to convince ourselves that this feature was real, but the strong signal and sharpness of the ALMA observations left no doubt about the structure. Suddenly we realised what we had found.’ The 'dust trap' was observed by Nienke van der Marel, a PhD student at Leiden Observatory in the Netherlands using the new Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Earlier observations using ESO's Very Large Telescope had already shown that the small dust particles also form a similar ring structure . Marel saw an area . circled by a ring of gas with a central hole that was probably created . by an unseen planet or companion star. What had been discovered was a region where bigger dust grains were trapped and could grow much larger by colliding and sticking together. This was a dust trap- just what the theorists were looking for. ‘It’s likely that we are looking at a kind of comet factory because the particles can grow in this dust trap up to cometary sizes of a few kilometres,’ said Marel. Artist's impression of the proposed disk structure of Oph IRS 48. The brown spots represent the large and small grains. The larger grains detected by ALMA are concentrated in the dust trap at the bottom of the image. The blue represents the distribution of carbon monoxide gas. The gap in is shown with the proposed planetary body that is sweeping the area clear and providing the conditions necessary to form the dust trap . ‘The dust is not likely to form full-sized planets at this distance from the star. But in the near future ALMA will be able to observe dust traps closer to their parent stars, where the same mechanisms are at work. ‘Such dust traps really would be the cradles for new-born planets.’ The dust trap forms as bigger dust particles move in the direction of higher pressure. Separate computer models have shown that such a high pressure region can originate from the motions of the gas at the edge of a gas hole- just like the one found in this disc. ‘Around the time that these observations were obtained, we were working on models predicting exactly these kinds of structures: a very lucky coincidence,’ said Cornelis Dullemond from the Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics in Heidelberg. This image from ALMA shows the dust trap in the disc that surrounds the system Oph-IRS 48. The dust trap provides a safe haven for tiny particles in the disc, allowing them to clump together and grow to sizes that allow them to survive on their own . The green region shows where the larger particles are located (millimetre-sized) and is the dust trap seen discovered by ALMA. The orange ring shows observations of much finer dust particles (micron-sized) using the VISIR instrument on ESO's Very Large Telescope .","Astronomers in the Netherlands have, for the first time, observed what they believe to be a comet factory .

One in five adults in the UK wants to ban Google Glass completely because of privacy concerns, according to new research. Researchers based in London surveyed 4,000 adults about the rise of wearable technology. Despite 18 per cent of those questioned saying they plan to buy Google Glass when it goes on sale next year, 51 per cent expressed serious privacy concerns about the device and 69 per cent demanded greater regulation. One in five adults in the UK wants to ban Google Glass completely, according to new research. 4,000 adults who were asked about the rise of wearable technology expressed privacy concerns about the devices . Earlier this month the first pornographic app for . Google Glass was released before being quickly banned. Adult app store MiKandi, makers of the headmounted pornography, were told by Google to remove the app and have been prohibited from making any such content. The 'T*** . & Glass,' app was downloaded . from the developer's website by 17 Google Glass owners on its debut day, . while the site was visited by some 10,000 people. The app allowed viewers to browse adult content and, with Glass’s capability of displaying and recording, the app also reportedly allowed users to record and upload their own intimate content. The study was . commissioned by web hosting company Rackspace with the Centre for Creative . and Social Technology (CAST) at Goldsmiths, University of London. They asked 2,000 UK adults and 2,000 adults in the U.S. their thoughts on wearable technology including whether they would buy devices, such as Google Glass, how they think they would use it, and what their biggest concerns were. More than half (51 per cent) of all the adults asked expressed serious privacy concerns about using wearable technology, with 53 per cent of UK adults likening it to TV show ‘Big Brother’. Around two thirds of all participants - 61 per cent - think Google Glass and wearable cameras should . be regulated, while 20 per cent think it . should be banned altogether. Respondents in the UK demand greater regulation, 69 per cent, compared to 55 per cent in the US. 'As with all new products that are cutting edge, there is always the question of how current laws, combined with consumer expectations, fit in with the product', says John Haggis, digital media lawyer at London-based media law firm Sheridans. 'When wearable technologies interact with other people and the environment around the user, then potential privacy or copyright issues can arise.' A model for adult app store MiKandi is shown wearing Google Glass. The company released the device's first pornography app called 'T*** & Glass' Monday but it was promptly shut down by Google. Privacy campaigners are concerned about such adult content leading to malware and other risks on wearable technology . 'The challenge for manufacturers of . wearable technologies is ensuring that where the device has the . potential to infringe another person’s rights, that the user is made . aware of how they should be using the device and also for other people . to recognise when the device is being used in a manner which they may . object, such as surreptitious videoing or photographing of people.' 'Hopefully manufacturers will take the . lead in this area so that new regulations are not needed. 'But it . shouldn’t come as a surprise if law makers decide to act to both compel . manufacturers to take privacy and other concerns into consideration when . developing these products, and also to protect people’s expectations of . privacy.' Nick Pickles, director of privacy . and civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch, added: 'The danger . with Google Glass is that the camera is seeing what you see, all the . time, while the microphone allows nearby conversations to be . eavesdropped on. How Glass works: A German designer created this infographic to show how the eyewear projects an image . 'It . is impossible to guarantee against these devices being hacked, so it . would be surprising if people are allowed to wear them anywhere like . Government buildings or in businesses that handle sensitive intellectual . property. 'While it’s . still dangerous to have a situation where someone could use glass . without permission from the other people who are being monitored by the . device, the implications of them being controlled by an unknown third . party would make phone hacking look like a minor blip. 'Google . Glass offers a uniquely detailed view of your life and your . surroundings and while Google’s main interest is selling advertising, . there are a whole range of reasons why other people might seek to do all . they can to get access to a device. 'The only way to protect yourself and the people around you is to not wear them.' In May, Google's Glass wearable computer was hacked so video and audio can be transmitted online to anyone. The infographic also reveals how Glass is focused so the image always appears sharp . Hackers are able to remotely watch and hear everything a wearer does, and . the hackers recently warned 'nothing is safe once your Glass has been hacked.' Although . Glass does not go on sale to the public until next year, the attack . raises major security and privacy questions over Google's plans for the . device. Despite the negative responses to the Rackspace study, an average of 18 per cent intend to buy Google Glass when it . goes on sale in 2014 - 21 per cent  of Americans and 15 per cent of . Brits. 71 per cent of Brits believe that these cloud-powered devices have . enhanced their lives in some way and 12 per cent of UK adults are already using wearable devices to improve their love life. Last week the first marriage proposal using Google Glass was recorded at Leeds Castle in Kent. Whereas 63 per cent of UK and 71 per cent of American respondents said that wearable technology has improved their health and fitness. The CAST study also revealed seven distinct profiles of people who use wearable technology. Another example of wearable technology is smart watches. This mockup of the much-rumoured iWatch was created by MacUser magazine. It is expected to link to an iPhone, and compete with Google's Glass in the wearable computer market . Curious users have no particular health, fitness, food, mood or emotional need for wearable technology. They are simply interested in what happens when they 'play' with these devices. Controllers tend to see everything in their life as 'a selection of parts contributing towards an overall ecosystem.' They will only purchase the device . once they know that it will do what they want it to do and they can . manage their data the way that they want to . The Quantified Selfer wants to track everything they do. Self Medics use wearable devices to take control over health and well-being. Google Glass was hacked earlier this year. Robert Scoble, a tech blogger, tweeted a picture of himself in the shower with Google Glass, which led to experts warning 'private moments' such as these could be seen by hackers. These reports have led to more than half of people asked in a recent study expressing serious privacy concerns about the device, and 69 per cent of UK adults calling for more regulation . Self Medics also often use multiple apps and devices to get an accurate account of their health. Finish line Fanatics love the idea of . the device and are really excited at the start, yet once they realise it . needs to be calibrated, charged, synced and sometimes needs them to . manually add data, the shine wears off. To the Transition Entrepreneur his . phone is classed as a form of ‘wearable tech’ because he always has it . on him, so he needs more from any other gadgets to make them all link . together. And finally, the Ubiquitous Future users are children who will grow up with the next generation of wearable technology and not know any different. The respondents were also asked about future technologies. 32 per cent of respondents said they are most excited about the arrival of nanotechnology such as microscopic ‘robots’ that could, for example, travel through blood and turn off cancer cells. 29 per cent admitted they are excited about the introduction of bionic limbs, a common feature in movies such as i-Robot and Bicentennial Man.

An archaeological row over when exactly mankind began leaving Africa has intensified with a new study dismissing one of the main theories. New genetic and archaeological findings suggest mankind only left Africa within the last 60,000 years rather than up to 120,000 years ago, according to a study. The two main theories for the timing of exodus put it either side of the Mount Toba supereruption of about 74,000 years ago but one of them, according to the study, is worthless. Lake Toba was formed from a volcanic eruption 74,000 years ago but did mankind leave Africa before it or afterwards? The eruption forms the fault-line between scientific theories on when people started colonising South East Asia. In an unusually strong scientific put-down, archaeologists involved in the latest study claim the theory that Man left Africa the before the volcanic eruption has 'no evidence'. Genetic evidence, they say, only backs up the idea that man left Africa within the last 60,000 years. Had colonisation of South East Asia and other parts of the world taken place much earlier, there would have been genetic traces surviving today. The 'lack of any discernable evidence' of such genetic traces, said the researchers, 'poses a final obstacle to the hypothesis of an early, pre-Toba modern human colonization of South Asia'. Stone tools and symbols like perforated beads and artistic engravings that had previously been used to support the pre-Toba theory actually date from 25,000 years after the eruption, they said. Prof Sir Paul Mellars, from the University of Cambridge, and other researchers presented their findings in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 'We find no evidence, either genetic or archaeological, for a very early modern human colonization of South Asia, before the Toba eruption,' they concluded. A view of Lake Toba which is 55 miles long and up to 1,600 feet deep. It was formed by a supervolcano 74,000 years ago. Ash from the volcano has been found thousands of miles away may have caused a nuclear winter. 'All of the available evidence supports a much later colonization beginning 50–55 ka [50-55,000 years ago. The eruption of Mount Toba in Sumatra 74,000 years ago is the biggest for the last two million years. It spewed out ten billion tons of ash . and left a huge hole in the ground which today forms Lake Toba - . fifty-five miles long, twenty miles wide and over 1600 feet deep. At the centre is Samosir Island - a popular tourist spot and the largest island-within-an-island in the world. 'We see no reason to believe that the initial modern human colonization of South and Southeast Asia was distinct from the process that is now well documented for effectively all of the other regions of Eurasia from 60 ka [60,000 years ago] onward.' They said in their summary: 'We show here this ""pre-Toba"" dispersal model is in serious conflict with both the most recent genetic evidence from both Africa and Asia and the archaeological evidence from South Asian sites. 'We present an alternative model based on a combination of genetic analyses and recent archaeological evidence from South Asia and Africa. 'These data support a coastally oriented dispersal of modern humans from eastern Africa to southern Asia about 60,000 to 50,000 years ago.'","Researchers dismiss alternative out of Africa theory has having 'no evidence'

Future: Wilson is now on solids with staff at the animal sanctuary hoping to reintroduce him back to the family who rejected him . Protective: Kimi is very protective of Wilson and will growl if anybody goes near him - treating him as if he was a puppy . Sad: The unusual 'mother and son' partnership are sure to miss each other when they are eventually separated . 'He took to the milk and . within a few days Kimi had literally taken over as mother.

"By . Rob Waugh . UPDATED: . 08:53 EST, 25 January 2012 . Debate has raged for 150 years over whether archaeopteryx it is a 'missing link' between dinosaurs and birds. Researchers at Brown University scanned its feathers - and found they were black and rigid . Scientists have used a powerful microscope to image a feather from a dinosaur long thought to be a 'missing link' in the evolution of birds - and discovered it had rigid, black feathers just like today's birds. Since its discovery 150 years ago, scientists have puzzled over whether the winged dinosaur Archaeopteryx is the missing link between dinosaurs and birds - and the moment when powered flight evolved. Much of the debate has focused on the iconic creature's wings and the mystery of whether — and how well — it could fly. The Archaeopteryx feather was discovered . in a limestone deposit in Germany in 1861, a few years after the . publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species - and paleontologists have debated about it ever since. An international team of researchers at Brown University have found conclusive proof that the creature's wings were black - and that the rigid wing feathers could have helped the creature flap and glide. Whether or not it could actually take off under its own power remains a mystery. The tiny dinosaur was only around the size of a raven, and its colour would have made it resemble one. The team also learned from its examination that Archaeopteryx's feather structure is identical to that of living birds, a discovery that shows modern wing feathers had evolved as early as 150 million years ago in the Jurassic period. The study appears in the journal Nature Communications. 'If Archaeopteryx was flapping or gliding, the presence of these cells would have given the feathers additional structural support,' said Ryan Carney, an evolutionary biologist at Brown and the paper's lead author. 'This would have been advantageous during this early evolutionary stage of dinosaur flight.' Paleontologists have long been excited about the fossil and other Archaeopteryx specimens, thinking they place the dinosaur at the base of the bird evolutionary tree. The traits that make Archaeopteryx an evolutionary intermediate between dinosaurs and birds, scientists say, are the combination of reptilian features (teeth, clawed fingers, and a bony tail) and avian features (feathered wings and a wishbone). After two unsuccessful attempts to image the melanosomes, the group tried a more powerful type of scanning electron microscope at Zeiss, where the group located patches of hundreds of the structures still encased in the fossilized feather. An earlier artist's impression of Archaeopteryx: The traits that make Archaeopteryx an evolutionary intermediate between dinosaurs and birds, scientists say, are the combination of reptilian features (teeth, clawed fingers, and a bony tail) and avian features (feathered wings and a wishbone) 'The third time was the charm, and we finally found the keys to unlocking the feather's original color, hidden in the rock for the past 150 million years,' said Carney, a graduate student in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, studying with Stephen Gatesy. Melanosomes had long been known to be present in other fossil feathers, but had been misidentified as bacteria. In 2006, coauthor Jakob Vinther, then a graduate student at Yale, discovered melanin preserved in the ink sac of a fossilized squid. 'This made me think that melanin could be fossilized in many other fossils such as feathers,' said Vinther, now a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Texas–Austin. 'I realized that I had opened a whole new chapter of what we can do to understand the nature of extinct feathered dinosaurs and birds.' The team measured the length and width of the sausage-shaped melanosomes, roughly 1 micron long and 250 nanometers wide. To determine the melanosome's color, Akron researchers Matthew Shawkey and Liliana D'Alba statistically compared Archaeopteryx's melanosomes with those found in 87 species of living birds, representing four feather classes: black, gray, brown, and a type found in penguins. 'What we found was that the feather was predicted to be black with 95 percent certainty,' Carney said.What the pigment was used for is less clear. The black color of the Archaeopteryx wing feather may have served to regulate body temperature, act as camouflage or be employed for display. But it could have been for flight, too. 'We can't say it's proof that Archaeopteryx was a flier. But what we can say is that in modern bird feathers, these melanosomes provide additional strength and resistance to abrasion from flight, which is why wing feathers and their tips are the most likely areas to be pigmented,' Carney said. 'With Archaeopteryx, as with birds today, the melanosomes we found would have provided similar structural advantages, regardless of whether the pigmentation initially evolved for another purpose.'","Archaeopteryx had rigid, black feathers .

Paedophile: Michael Jackson abducted, tied up and sexually assaulted a 10-year-old boy . A convicted paedophile snatched a boy of ten off the street in broad daylight with the warning: ‘If you scream, I’m gonna kill ya.’ Former pirate radio DJ Michael Jackson watched the boy walk past his apartment to a shop to buy a fizzy drink, then lay in wait for him to return. After grabbing him from behind and warning him he would die if he did not keep quiet, Jackson marched the boy back to his housing association flat, bound him with rope and duct-tape and shoved him into an airing cupboard with a pillow case over his head. Jackson, 50, is then said to have groped the boy, repeatedly threatening to kill him if he made a noise. The terrified child was found more than three hours later – naked from the waist down and begging for help – after he managed to free some of his bonds to shuffle to a window when Jackson went out. He was seen by a family friend who had been helping to search for him, and told them: ‘I’ve been kidnapped, the man’s gone and left me.’ Twice-married Jackson was arrested later that day at the home of a friend where he had gone to play computer games. Police believe he had left his flat in Oldbury, West Midlands – which was run by a housing association which works to help resettle  ex-offenders – to build himself an alibi with the intention of returning later to molest the boy. Just four days before the kidnap last November, Jackson had failed in an attempt to snatch the same child, who lived 250 yards from his flat, chasing him to his front door. While police were investigating the second incident, a ten-year-old girl came forward to reveal how two months earlier, Jackson had lured her to his flat to look at his goldfish and, under the pretext of a ‘cops and robbers game’, tied her up before photographing her. Although no sexual assault took place, prosecutors believe Jackson’s motives had been sexual.Jackson, who has at least one grown-up child, has a criminal history stretching back to 1976 with 20 convictions for 73 offences.

President Obama held a surprise secret meeting with several reporters at the White House on Monday, as he seeks to placate the press over a series of recent scandals. While off-the-record meetings are not new at the White House, it wasn't until the selected reporters were already in the meeting that the President arrived. The briefing had originally been listed as a briefing by White House Chief of Staff, Denis McDonough. Clandestine: Barack Obama in the Oval Office. The President joined reporters for an off-the-record meeting . The Obama Administration has been criticized in the past week after details of the NSA's surveillance were leaked. The revelations come after reports of the Department Justice collecting Associated Press phone records, and the IRS allegedly targeting right-wing groups. About 24 reporters attended the meeting, . where they were given direct access to the President as he discussed his . thoughts on recent events - although they were not able to report what was said. When the Justice Department had attempted to hold a similar briefing in the wake of the revelation that it had collected phone records from Associated Press reporters, several news publications protested, and the New York Times refused publicly to attend. With Monday's unexpected meeting, New York Times reporter . Peter Baker said if he had known President Obama would be attending, he and his editors would have . reconsidered whether to go to the briefing. Pressure: President Obama is facing tough questions after revelations about national surveillance programs . 'Our concern about . off-the-record sessions with the President is that they not become . substitutes for opportunities to ask questions and get answers on the . record which, after all, is our job,' Mr Baker told Buzzfeed. Secret briefings have been a common feature at the White House, since John F Kennedy used to entertain his favored reporters in his office. After the off-the-record meeting, reporters . who attended told Buzzfeed it had been a valuable experience in . understanding the President's thoughts, even if they were unable to share . their insight with readers. The most recent leak to affect the White House was the revelations about phone record and internet surveillance. On Friday, the President had sought to address fears over the national security programs. One  involves the collection of . U.S. Verizon customers phone records. The other, dubbed PRISM, . allows the government to see the internet searches of foreign nationals . overseas who use any of nine U.S.-based internet providers such as . Microsoft and Google. 'My assessment and my team's assessment was that [the programs] help us prevent terrorist attacks and that the modest encroachments on privacy that are involved in getting phone numbers or duration [of calls] without a name attached... It was worth us doing,' he said. In his statement at the White House he said Congress had approved the two programs. 'I . think it’s important to understand that you can’t have 100 per cent . security and then have 100 per cent privacy and zero inconvenience,' the . President said. Tradition: Secret meetings with the press have been a feature of the White House since John F Kennedy's days . At a briefing on Tuesday, intelligence officials sought to convince House lawmakers that the  collection of phone records and internet usage was necessary and did not trample on privacy rights. However, the American Civil Liberties Union asked a New York court on Tuesday to demand that the Obama administration end the program and purge the records it has collected. Polls by the Washington Post and Pew Research Center showed a majority of Americans support some aspects of the spy programs, putting the need to investigate terrorist threats over the need to protect personal privacy, according to Associated Press.","Journalists were already in private meeting when President arrived .

A two-year-old girl died of septicaemia just hours after doctors discharged her from hospital - telling her mother she was just being paranoid. Brooklyn Harrold was taken to Northampton General Hospital on May 9 this year suffering from a high temperature. Her mother, Leanne, 20, claims she was kept waiting for five hours while she begged doctors to do a chest X-ray or refer her daughter to Birmingham Children’s Hospital. Brooklyn Harrold, 2, died of septicaemia just hours after she was discharged from Northampton General Hospital without even having had a full blood test, her mother, Leanne, claims . She was kept in overnight but discharged at 9pm the next day - even though her mother believes no full blood test had been carried out. Ms Harrold said staff told her they suspected her daughter had gastroenteritis and even called her a ‘paranoid mother’ when she begged medics to re-examine Brooklyn. But less than 24 hours after the tot was taken back to her grandparents’ house, an ambulance was called to take her back to the same hospital. A full blood test was then carried out on the toddler and preparations were made to transfer her to Birmingham Children’s Hospital. In order to get a ventilation tube into Brooklyn, doctors allegedly told her mother they had to put her in an induced coma, but she died minutes after being sedated. The toddler had a history of medical problems as she was born with truncus arteriosus - a rare heart disease that caused her to have one large artery instead of two - and needed an operation to install a tube which connected the organ to her lungs. Her mother, Leanne, 20, took Brooklyn to the hospital after she developed a high fever but had to wait for five hours before she was seen by a doctor and admitted . It is not yet known how she developed blood poisoning but it is thought she might have had a liver infection which developed into septicaemia. Ms Harrold, who lives in Northampton, said she is taking legal action against the hospital as she felt the standard of treatment Brooklyn received was ‘unacceptable’. She said: ‘I got her up on the Saturday morning and she was yellow. She was as yellow as a banana skin - I was freaking out. ‘I got a taxi to my mum’s, and she took one look at Brooklyn and rang an ambulance. ‘Her whole body was swollen and you couldn’t pick her up because she would scream. Brooklyn was then discharged the next day despite the fact her temperature was still 'sky high'. Ms Harrold also claims that doctors accused her of being 'paranoid' Just 24 hours after she was discharged, Brooklyn turned yellow and was rushed back to the hospital by ambulance where it was decided that she should be transferred to Birmingham Children's Hospital . ‘Her heart consultant was waiting for her at Northampton General Hospital and they said they wanted to refer her to Birmingham Children’s Hospital. ‘I said that’s fine, I wanted this done two days ago on Thursday. ‘They said they needed to put her in a coma and put her on life support to get her there. ‘She died for three minutes when they were trying to get the tube into her and they massaged her heart to get her back. ‘But she died after they had done it and they couldn’t save her. She died shortly after being put in an induced coma to prepare her for transfer for Birmingham Children's Hospital. Brooklyn suffered from a rare heart condition and had to have surgery at 10-months (pictured) Her great-grandfather, Michael Diggin, believes she was treated differently by staff because of her heart condition and that she could have been saved if they had reacted more quickly . ‘I am going to sue. Her consultant is doing an investigation and I am going to get myself a solicitor. ‘On the Thursday they kept her waiting in Paddington Ward (at Northampton General Hospital) for five hours and then a doctor came and listened to her chest and breathing. ‘They said they didn’t need to do blood tests and they left her sitting in the waiting room for another two-and-a-half hours. ‘She was really struggling by this point, her heart beat was jumping through her chest. ‘Seven times I asked for heart scans and chest X-rays on the Friday and asked for someone who knew about Brooklyn’s condition. ‘They kept telling me ""no, no, no"". I said I wanted her transferred to Birmingham Children’s Hospital but Paddington Ward said she didn’t need to go there and that they were sending her home. Ms Harrold says that Brooklyn's sister, Tia, 4 (pictured), keeps asking when she is going to see her sister again and does not understand what has happened . ‘They sent her home at 10pm and it was freezing cold. When my nan picked us up, she said “that baby looks really ill”.’ Ms Harrold added: ‘I’m disgusted at the treatment Brooklyn received. I think it could have been better. ‘Her sister is distraught and keeps asking when she is going to see Brooklyn. ‘I have taken her to Brooklyn’s grave, but I can’t explain what has happened to a four-year-old. ‘At the time they told me I was a paranoid mother, but I feared for my daughter’s health.’ The results from the blood test carried out by the hospital on May 11 later revealed Brooklyn was suffering from septicaemia - which has been put on her death certificate. Northampton General Hospital is carrying out an investigation into the circumstances surrounding Brooklyn's death but Ms Harrold says that she is going to sue the hospital . Brooklyn’s great-grandfather Michael Diggin said he believed she had been treated differently by staff due to her history of heart problems. He said: ‘It was probably 50/50 that she may die of septicaemia, but if you catch it earlier you enhance the chances of survival. ‘I believe they lost a 36-hour window to treat her with antibiotics.’ A spokesman for Northampton General Hospital said a full investigation had been launched into the circumstances surrounding Brooklyn’s death. He said: ‘We offer our sincere condolences to Brooklyn’s family for their tragic loss. ‘We will be discussing the results of that investigation with the family when it is complete. ‘It would not be appropriate for us to comment further at this time.’ A spokesman for the Northamptonshire County Coroner said no inquest was due to be held into Brooklyn’s death.","Brooklyn Harrold was taken to Northampton General Hospital with a fever .

Nearly 209,000 falls were recorded in hospitals in England last year, with 900 patients suffering severe harm such as hip fractures and head injuries, and 90 patients dying. Many elderly patients worry about pressing the call button for help in going to the bathroom because they do not want to be any trouble. Don't want to be any trouble: Two elderly patients a week are dying in hospital because of falls according to a new report . New guidelines from NICE – the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence – say medics must encourage vulnerable patients to use the bedside calling system. Damien Longson, a consultant psychiatrist who led the NICE panel, said: ‘Many patients who need extra support in carrying out simple tasks, such as reaching to get a drink or going to the bathroom, do not wish to make a fuss or to be seen as a burden to staff. ‘This can lead to them attempting to carry out these activities independently, which puts them at a greater risk of falling. In doing so, they can cause themselves significant harm and end up staying longer in hospital than they otherwise would have needed to. ‘The NICE guideline advises doctors and nurses to reassure their patients that it is OK for them to press the call button, and that they are there to help them if needed.’ Vulnerable: Doctors are advised to consider all patients aged over 65 to be at high risk of falling over . Nurses and doctors are advised to consider all patients aged 65 years and older to be at high risk of  falling over. The same warning goes for those of 50 and above with dementia, stroke, vision or hearing problems and other underlying conditions. Doctors and nurses should create a plan to cut each patient’s chances of falling while in their care – for example by adjusting their medication, offering alternative footwear and helping them go to the lavatory. Research shows the psychological impact of falling can have a devastating effect on the confidence and independence of older people, often increasing feelings of isolation and depression. Half of those with a hip fracture never regain their former level of function and one in five die within three months. Hard to recover: Half of those with a hip fracture never regain their former level of function and one in five die within three months . Mark Baker, of the centre for clinical practice at NICE, said: ‘Falling over is a serious problem in hospitals, and unfortunately their likelihood increases with age as people become frailer. 'They can cause distress, pain, injury, a loss of confidence and independence, and in some cases, death. ‘While it would be virtually impossible to prevent all hospital falls from happening, our guideline calls for doctors and nurses to address the issues that will reduce the risk of their patients suffering avoidable harm. No two patients are the same and so a “one size fits all” approach will not work.’ Hospital staff will be asked to consider factors that make a fall more likely, such as previous mishaps, types of medication and eyesight or balance problems. Peter Carter, of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ‘Falls can make an already distressing time even more difficult for vulnerable patients, and any advice and support which helps reduce these incidents is good news for staff and patients.’ Michelle Mitchell, of Age UK, said the consequences of a fall in later life can be devastating for patients. She added: ‘In addition to the pain caused to the individual, falls cost around £6million a day in hospital and social care costs. ‘Implementing these new guidelines to reduce falls in hospitals must be a priority for our Health Service, not only to improve patient safety, but to help save precious NHS resources.’","Almost 209,000 falls were recorded in England's hospitals last year .

Legoland used to be a happy place, but a recent study has found that Lego's Minifigures, those little plastic figurines, are visibly less cheery than they used to be, with faces expressing emotions such as confusion, anger and fear. Dr Christoph Bartneck, a robot expert at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand, and a colleague studied a subset of all 6000 Minifigures from 1975 to 2010 and found that from the early Nineties onwards, Lego's mini-figures' facials expressions have been diversifying from consistently happy smiles to expressions reflecting greater conflict. Bartneck's study considered the range of facial expressions across various Lego sets – now often part of themes such as Star Wars, pirates or Harry Potter. Sad-face: According to Christoph Bartneck (pictured) of Canterbury University in New Zealand, Lego Minifigures are not the sunny, perpetually happy little plastic people they once were . They chose Lego because of the company's age: 'This gives us a real opportunity to see within one company's product and how it has changed,' Bartneck told Australia's ABC702 radio. 'What we observed is that the proportion of faces being introduced every year is changing in the sense of their facial expressions. Until the early '90s there were just a couple of faces and they were pretty much smiling, then they added beards and sunglasses... somewhere around the 2000s it exploded, we have so many different types of faces.' Bartneck writes in the paper, 'Our cluster analysis shows that toy design has become a more complex design space in which the imaginary world of play does not only consist of a simple division of good versus evil, but a world in which heroes are scared and villains can have superior smile.' Bartneck and his colleague charted the expressions beneath the plastic helmets of hair to illustrate just how much grumpier the two-inch Minifigures have become over the years. In the mid-'90s, about 80 per cent of the figures were happy-go-lucky. By 2010, about 50 per cent of the figurines were distinctly less cheerful. 'It is important to study how to create appropriate expressions and how these expressions are perceived by the users. Children's toys and how they are perceived can have a significant impact on children,' Bartneck told the Guardian. Attitude adjustment: It's not just the bad characters who look scared, or the good characters who look smug among the 6000 Lego Minifigures that exist, reflecting a more realistic range of human emotions . Bartneck identified the range of expressions now shown on Minifigures' faces as disdain, confidence, concern, fear, happiness, and anger. 'We cannot help but wonder how the move from only positive faces to an increasing number of negative faces impacts on how children play,' he said. So is it a good thing that Lego faces now reflect a full range of human emotions? 'It would be silly to live in a toy world where everyone is smiling all the time,' said Bartneck to ABC702. 'Children need to play out conflicts, our world is full of conflicts. You fight with your brothers and sisters, you have some arguments with you parents and of course it's necessary that children learn through playing to deal with conflict.' Grim: This stately character clearly has a lot weighing on his mind . Bartneck says his study can't tell us whether or not the changing themes in Lego is bad for our children or not. 'But I can reflect on it,' he said. 'This discussion is not just with Minifigures, it's actually a wider discussion. For example, do computer games actually result in violent behavior? It's a bit of a chicken and egg situation - is it the games that make children violent or is it the violent kids who like these kind of games?' he said to ABC702. Bartneck thinks the real cause for concern lies in the lack of creativity now required in Lego games. While children used to build their own fantasy worlds out of Lego, now they're given the theme, the characters and the story. 'You have Star Wars and you replay someone else's fantasy, versus using Lego to create your own little houses, your own little world and be then much more creative in that way,' he said. Lighten up: These Storm Trooper minifigures are a part of the Lego Star Wars set, one of many conflict-based Lego sets available . Bartneck notes the changes of facial expressions are a reflection of the market - Lego sets are becoming more conflict-oriented because of the stories they're telling. The traditional Lego sets Bartneck used to play with as a child are still available - it's just that kids want Batman, Lord of the Rings and Star Wars-themed sets. He believes the Lego company should be careful not to overuse negative expressions, and reconsider its focus on conflict-based themes. 'Lego might not be able to hold on to its highly positive reputation,' he writes in the paper. 'The children that grow up with Lego today will remember not only smileys, but also anger and fear in the Minifigures’ faces. Designers of agent faces should take great care to design the expressions and to test their effect since toys play an important role in the development of children.' About face: Lego Minifigures' faces have changed since the '90s to reflect a range of human emotions including disdain, confidence, concern, fear, happiness and anger . Bartneck points out that the influx of film and TV-based themes in Lego was necessary for the company to survive - indeed, its Star Wars-themed set saved the company - but that the company should take care to make the Minifigures look comic rather than realistic. 'The example of the Minifigures shows that to appeal to users it is necessary to offer a wide range of emotional expressions that connects to the complex interaction scenarios of today’s users. Instead of focusing on highly realistic expressions, it may be worthwhile to increase the variability of expressions. A comic style expression is sufficient to convey a full spectrum of emotions and intensities,' he writes. For their part, Lego says the company vigorously tests each Lego Minifigure before it is put into production. Roar Rude Trangbæk, communications manager for Lego, told the Guardian that every toy was tested by a range of expert children, while child psychiatrists, parents and teachers were also consulted. The company's research found that children, especially boys, enjoy playing out conflicts between characters, he said. 'The conflict between good and evil is nothing new,' said Trangbæk. 'But the characters always have classic Lego humor – the good guys always win in the end.' He suggested if parents are worried about the face of one of their children's Minifigures, there's an easy solution: pulling off the Minifigure's head and replacing it with another more pleasing visage. Bartneck will present his findings at the first International Conference on Human-Agent Interaction in Sapporo, Japan, in August.","Lego's Minifigures' faces used to be universally happy, but now depict a range of negative emotions, too .

Judge: Constance Briscoe is to be charged with two counts of intending to pervert the course of justice . One of Britain’s best known woman judges was charged with perverting the course of justice yesterday over the Chris Huhne speeding affair. Constance Briscoe, 56, is accused of lying in statements to Essex Police. The barrister and part-time judge was a friend and neighbour of Vicky Pryce, the disgraced Lib Dem politician’s ex-wife. Prosecutors accuse Briscoe of misleading police by falsely claiming she had no dealings with the Press. She faces charges of providing inaccurate statements to detectives and altering a copy of a witness statement before claiming it was correct. Briscoe, who has been suspended from the judiciary pending the investigation, vowed to clear her name. In a statement, she said: ‘I am deeply distressed at the decision of the Crown Prosecution Service to charge me today. I have not committed the offences alleged and I will fight the allegations in court. 'There is a great deal more I would like to say but I have been advised that I should not do so at this stage.’ She is  due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court in central London on June 24. Both Pryce and former Energy Secretary  Huhne received eight-month sentences after it emerged that she had taken speeding points for her former husband a decade ago. Huhne pleaded guilty on the first day of a planned joint trial in February, and economist Pryce was later convicted by a jury.

John Bercow has been accused of encouraging groaning of a Lib Dem MP every time he is called to speak in the Commons. Cambridge MP Dr Julian Huppert claims the abuse he receives across the green benches amounts to workplace bullying which sets a ‘very bad example’ to the viewing public. But analysis of Mr Bercow’s role in the abuse reveals his frequent mock surprise at heckling from the Labour side and repeatedly referring him to him as ‘the good doctor’. Bullying: Lib Dem Dr Julian Huppert has complained about the abuse and groans which greet his every appearance in the Commons but Speaker John Bercow is accused of not helping with his references to the 'good doctor' Dr Huppert has gained a reputation in Westminster for long-winded questions and interventions in debates. He riled long-serving MPs when he arrived in the Commons in 2010 by suggesting they all needed to be sent on a crash course in basic scientific techniques. But his every appearance in the Commons is now greeted with a chorus of abuse even before he has spoken. Mr Bercow appears to join in with the teasing. While he calls most MPs to ask a questions simply by shouting their name, this week he announced Dr Huppert with: ‘Time for a dose from the doctor.' One MP today claimed Mr Bercow’s behaviour ‘doesn’t help’ to curtail the abuse. Julian Huppert is one of the most frequent speakers in the Commons, but his interventions are often long and fail to hold the attention of other MPs. Here is an example of some of his contributions: . 'I dare say that I have occasionally done things that are “capable” of annoying other people in this Chamber; I am sure we all have.' 10 June 2013'If the hon. Lady listened more and spoke less, she would hear what I am going to say.' To Labour's transport spokesman Maria Eagle 16 May 2012'A number of people said that they had become interested in politics as a result of following Twitter and receiving tweets from myself.' 13 October 2011 . Dr Huppert would not be drawn specifically on the Speaker’s role in the bullying, but told The Times the joke had gone too far. He said: ‘I think it's an example of how badly behaved Prime Minister's Questions are. ‘There are people shouting and talking in a deeply discourteous way. ""It is perfectly reasonable to respond to what people are saying but I think the atmosphere is far too often [about] trying to shout down people and that's a very bad example for everybody.’ He tried to put a brave face on the attention he now receives. ‘You have to have a bit of a thick skin. In some ways it's better to be noticed than ignored.’ At Prime Minister’s Questions yesterday Dr Huppert had only got 14 words into asking David Cameron about carers week before Mr Bercow was forced to intervene to silence the wall of jeers. Hansard, the official record of Commons debates, often records groans of ‘Oh no!’ from MPs when Dr Huppert is called. However, there are some who believe Dr Huppert’s striking appearance – he has a ginger goatee beard – and manner may rile and amuse his opponents. Last month his local paper questioned why his contributions to Parliament were met with such mirth. Daniel Zeichner, his Labour opponent in the city, told the Cambridge News: ‘Parliamentary behaviour is quite often pretty poor and I wouldn’t encourage that kind of behaviour. ‘But, having said that, Julian can sometimes be a touch annoying.’ SNP MP Angus MacNeil said that that MPs' behaviour amounted to ‘collective bullying’ and claimed that Mr Bercow ‘doesn't help’. He said: ‘For whatever reason, people are picking on him because he's brighter than them or because he has red hair. ‘Before the man has opened his mouth this nonsense has started. It's very unedifying,’ he told The Times. Julian Huppert addresses the Commons . Regular observers of Parliament know that Commons Speaker John Bercow enjoys having his say. All he has to do is call out an MP's name, but he rarely misses the chance to comment on the groans which greet Julian Huppert - which only seems to encourage them:'Order. It is very discourteous of the House to issue a collective groan - notably on the Opposition Benches. It is quite inexplicable. I have called the good doctor; let us hear from the good doctor.' 13 February 2013 . 'I have a choice on the Lib Dem Benches between two doctors. Let us hear from the good Dr Julian Huppert.' 25 March 2013 . 'Members on both sides are very discourteous to the good doctor. I cannot for the life of me fathom why there are groans whenever I call the good doctor, but it is very unsatisfactory.' 24 April 2013 . 'I call Dr Julian Huppert. If he can speak more briefly—he does not have to—more Members will get in.' 21 May 2013 . 'I am looking for a sharp mind and pithy expression, and I need look no further than Dr Julian Huppert.' 3 June 2013 . 'Time for a dose from the doctor.' 10 June 2013 .

She is battling her late father's relatives, claiming she was the victim of a 'conspiracy' to cut her out of inheriting more than £500,000 . A woman claims her father’s relatives conspired to cut her out of a £500,000 inheritance because she ‘shamed their family’ by being born out of wedlock. Chloe Brennan says her father’s siblings ‘never liked her and didn’t want to know her’. The mother of two claims her half-French father, Francoise Devillebichot, ‘treated her like a princess’ and promised she would never have to worry about money again after he died. But when Mr Devillebichot died of throat cancer in 2011, aged 65, Mrs Brennan, 40, was shocked to find he had signed a will on his deathbed. That left the bulk of his £620,000 estate – including his home in Harrow, north London, and a flat in Cannes – to his sisters Anne and Lucille, his brother  Phillippe and the children of a third sister, Jackie. Mrs Brennan, who is her late father’s only child, wants the High Court to rule the will invalid and hand Mr Devillebichot’s entire fortune to her. She told the court how her paternal grandfather, Georges Devillebichot, was a top French diplomat who lived in London and married an English girl, setting up home in Knightsbridge and raising their four children. She said this auspicious upbringing led to her father’s siblings feeling ‘shame’ and ‘unfounded hostility’ when she was born illegitimate. Mrs Brennan, of Reading, told Judge Mark Herbert QC she had to take a DNA test following her father’s death to ‘prove her heritage’. In the will she was left £100,000. But Mrs Brennan insisted that on her wedding day her father promised her his worldly goods and she ‘fears the will is in fact a forgery’. She claims Jackie and Anne, together with their cousins Anthony Prior and Andrew Prior – the executors of the estate – were ‘part of a conspiracy to fraudulently propound an invalid will’. They deny those accusations, along with claims the siblings exerted ‘undue influence’ on their dying brother to get him to make the will. Mrs Brennan told the court: ‘I contend that the siblings took advantage of my father’s admission to hospital and indisposition by making and arranging the will. ‘If he did sign the will, he was . compelled to sign any document put before him, without ever knowing the . full and real contents of it or its implications. ‘The circumstances around the making . of the will raise suspicion. It was made when my father was admitted to . hospital and the siblings were told he had seven days to live. I wasn’t . contacted. The next day he signed the will, effectively excluding his . only daughter, directly contrary to previous discussions with me. Ms Brennan's cousins Anthony Prior - a magistrate and executor of the will - and Andrew Prior outside London's High Court. She accuses the pair of taking part in the conspiracy against her . ‘I believe that there is a suspicion or doubt that this will was invalid and hope the court will reach the same conclusion.’ Luke Harris, representing Mr Devillebichot’s siblings, said the way the will divided the assets was ‘perfectly understandable’. He added the £100,000 gift to Mrs . Brennan, far from being shocking, ‘reflected his favourable treatment of . his daughter during his life’. Cross-examining Mrs Brennan, he said: ‘He was getting tired of giving you money.’ Mr Harris told the court: ‘The will is . rational on its face. The evidential burden is upon Mrs Brennan to . raise a real doubt about capacity. It is submitted that she has clearly . failed to discharge that burden. ‘There is certainly no evidence that . raises even a prima facie case that the Priors, Anne and Jackie have . forged or falsely propounded the will or conspired to commit forgery. ‘The Priors are both respectable . members of society. It is inherently unlikely that two such individuals . would come to court to lie.’ The hearing continues.

It is unclear if the high-ranking detective, who quit his job last month, applied to be a contestant on the . reality TV show while working for the Metropolitan Police.

A daughter has been ordered today to repay at least £290,000 into her dead mother's estate after a top judge ruled that she had unintentionally exerted ‘undue influence’ over the widow. Susan Burbidge, 47, was . locked in a bitter legal war with her brothers and other family members . over cash and property transfers made to her from her mother Phyllis . Hart in the year before she died. In an acrimonious and enormously costly . High Court struggle, her brothers, Ken and Paul Hart, accused Mrs Burbidge of . taking control of their 'vulnerable' 86-year-old mother’s finances in the months . before her death in 2008. Legal battle: Susan Burbidge (right) has been ordered to pay back hundreds of thousands of pounds into her dead mother's estate after a legal battle with brothers Kenneth Hart (left) and Paul Hart . However she said she bore the burden . of looking after Mrs Hart and that her brother Ken stopped visiting her . and did not send flowers on Mother's Day. Judge Sir William Blackburne today . acquitted Mrs Burbidge of any conscious wrong-doing, but said that her . 'relationship of influence' over mother cast doubt on whether the pensioner’s generosity came from her own free will. In a ruling which . represents a financial catastrophe for Susan and her husband Brian, the . judge expressed ‘real concern’ that Phyllis had not ‘really understood’ the many letters she signed shortly before her death. He . said that Phyllis’s gifts to her daughter ‘called for an explanation’ and that Susan had failed to convince him that her mother appreciated . exactly what she was doing and was acting ‘fully independently’. Although . Susan paid £410,000 into Mrs Hart's estate before the case hit court, . the ruling means she must pay back the balance of what her mother gave . her, at least £290,000. The judge ruled that her brothers and . her mother’s other heirs should be in the same position they would have . been in had the gifts never been made. During the eight-day case, Mrs . Burbidge had vehemently denied she was out to get as much of the estate . as she could and insisted she only ever had her mother’s best interests . at heart. She said of her . brothers: 'We didn’t get on. I didn’t like the way they treated mum. It . upset mum and I was incredibly protective of mum. The only thing I was . protective of was my mother. Family feud: Judge Sir William Blackburne today acquitted Mrs Burbidge at the High Court (pictured) of any conscious wrongdoing but said he was not convinced her mother made the gifts of her own free will . 'My . aim where mum was concerned was to make sure that, in her last few . years of life, she was happy; that she wasn’t left on her own. 'It was for me to look after mum and make sure she was OK. That was my intention.' The court heard Mrs Hart, who lived . in Upton, Poole, until the final year of her life, inherited the . £1million-plus estate when her husband Ernest, who had a successful . marquee business, died in 2005. Ken Hart, 67, of Poole, claimed that, . by 2007, his mother was increasingly under the influence of his sister . and denied that he had in any way neglected his filial duties. He said he had been working long hours and had done his best to keep in touch when she moved house during her final year. He previously said in court that his mother was a . 'good woman and housewife' but claimed she 'could not make up her mind . about anything' - even when it came to choosing her own curtains. Claims: Mrs Burbidge said her brother Ken didn't send flowers on Mother's Day . And she had no idea about financial matters, he told the court. Tension was already building within . the family after Phyllis announced the previous year that she was . transferring part of the company's business premises to Susan, the court . heard. The brothers' lawyers say that, by the . time of Phyllis's death, nearly everything her husband had left her - . valued at over £1million - had been transferred to Susan Burbidge and her . husband Brian, subject to an 'unsigned loan agreement' that the couple . would pay back £410,000 into her estate. Mrs Burbidge's barrister, Paul Emmerson, . suggested that Kenneth had succeeded in 'alienating' his mother, who had . become increasingly 'angry and bitter' at his apparent indifference. Ruling on the case today, Sir William . said all the witnesses in the case had tried to speak honestly about . events as they saw them and that there had been no conscious wrong-doing . in Mrs Burbidge’s dealings with her mother. However, . he concluded: 'I am left at the end of the day with a real concern as . to whether Phyllis really understood the many letters that went out . under her signature. 'Even . if, contrary to the evidence, Phyllis did fully understand what she was . doing and fully intended to act as she did, the question remains, was what she did the result of the exercise of an independent will?' Emphasising . the relationship of trust and reliance between mother and daughter, he . concluded: 'At the end of the day it is for Susan to persuade me that . her mother was acting fully independently of this undue influence. I am . not persuaded that she was.'","Judge acquitted Susan Burbidge, of Poole, of any conscious wrongdoing .

"By . James Chapman, Daily Mail Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 02:38 EST, 13 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:49 EST, 13 June 2013 . Steel: Home Secretary Theresa May, pictured leaving Number 10 this week, urged the Tory party not to buckle . Theresa May has cast herself as the Tories’ new Iron Lady, telling colleagues pushing through unpopular spending cuts and reforms: ‘Whatever you do, don’t buckle.’ In another speech ranging far beyond her Home Office brief, the most senior woman in the Government insisted it was possible to do ‘more for less’ across the public sector – highlighting welfare, defence and local government. Mrs May also suggested the Government had to do more to stand up to vested interests in the private sector – particularly banks and big utilities. ‘Big, unaccountable businesses that manipulate markets or abuse their monopoly positions should also be in our sights. 'Whether it’s the banking sector, where customers find it difficult to switch companies, or the big utility firms, with their opaque pricing plans, or the oil industry, which stands accused of price fixing by whistleblowers, we should be as tough with the private sector as we are with the public sector,’ the Home Secretary said. In a speech to the centre-Right think tank Reform, Mrs May, who has been careful not to stray from her brief since speculation about her leadership ambitions erupted earlier this year, sketched out a broad platform for a Tory victory in 2015. The steely Home Secretary, hailed as ‘Britain’s Angela Merkel’ by her allies, said the Conservatives’ mission went far beyond the elimination of the vast budget deficit left behind by Labour. She pointed out that her party had questioned the level of Labour’s public spending as long ago as the 2001 election campaign but ‘sadly our argument fell on deaf ears, and we all know what came next’. A senior Tory minister today fuelled speculation that Theresa May is positioning herself as a future party leader. In the Commons Labour MP John Spellar (Warley) said Mrs May could benefit from persuading police forces to buy more British vehicles, as he urged Government departments to back the country's car industry. Mr Spellar: 'Will you talk to the Home Secretary and get her to back British industry? It might even help her leadership ambitions.' Mr Fallon prompted cheers from the Commons as he replied: 'They may not need that much help.' ‘High taxes, a structural deficit, . unreformed public services and an unbalanced economy meant that when the . crash came, Britain wasn’t ready,’ she added. Mrs . May said there was ‘no other way’ than fundamental reform of the public . sector and pointed to her own success in reducing crime, while slashing . budgets. ‘When we said we . would cut central government police budgets by twenty per cent in real . terms over four years, the critics – not just the Labour Party, but . ACPO, the Police Federation and many academics – were united. Frontline . policing would be decimated and crime would go up. 'But in fact, the opposite happened – crime is down by more than ten per cent since the election,’ she said. ‘That crime is down is thanks to the efforts of thousands of officers up and down the country and the leadership of chief constables, but it’s also down to police reform. Mrs May pointed to measures to make . police more accountable via beat meetings, crime maps and elected . commissioners, and the abolition of national targets and the . introduction of greater flexibility in police employment. ‘We’re delivering more with less,’ she insisted. The . Home Secretary said the Tories had to ‘make sure that the debate in . this country never returns to the false choice of more spending or worse . services’. She went on: . 'We have to reassure people about our motives and our values. We have to . show them that we’re committed to universal public services and we must . never appear to be doctrinaire about what we’re doing. 'We . have to be clear that we’re reducing spending on public services not . because we care little for them, but because we have to for the sake of . our economy.' Pointer: Mrs May set out what David Cameron needed to do to win back support and reassure voters he holds Conservative values . Urging Cabinet colleagues not to waver in the teeth of opposition to reforms, she said: ‘Difficult decisions often mean upsetting people – especially when the change involves pay and conditions. But that doesn’t mean you can shirk them. ‘You have to decide what is in the national interest and do it. Keep making your case, always remind people of what you’re trying to achieve, what’s the end objective, but whatever you do, don’t buckle.’ Mrs May would not countenance any sort of leadership challenge to David Cameron, and has repeatedly stressed her loyalty to him. However, she is understood to regard Boris Johnson as ‘faintly ridiculous’ and is determined to prevent him becoming leader in the event of the Tories losing the next election.","Home Secretary ranges far beyond her brief with rallying cry to Cabinet .

Web security firm Kaspersky said 23 per cent of searches its software blocked in the UK in the first five months of this year were for pornography. A quarter of children who try to get around parental controls on the internet are looking for porn (picture posed by model) The parent-installed software sends data to the company each time it blocks access to a malicious site if the customer has not opted out of supplying such information. Of nearly 30,000 blocked searches, 23.3 per cent were for porn sites, 19.6 per cent for online stores and 16.1 per cent for social networking sites. It also blocked online gaming sites (5.9 per cent), gambling sites (3.0 per cent) and information about weapons (2.9 per cent). The research, also carried out by Kaspersky on its international customer base, recorded more than 25million attempts to access online porn globally in the last month alone. Other subjects blocked included online gaming sites, gambling sites and information about weapons . The Mail is campaigning for internet providers to automatically block access to porn, with an optional opt-in, rather than parents having to rely on software such as Kaspersky to limit access. At a debate organised by think tank the Policy Exchange in London yesterday, politicians and medical professionals discussed the increasing harm unbridled access to porn is having on teenagers. John Woods, a consultant psychotherapist at the NHS Portman Clinic in London who treats young men and women addicted to porn, told the audience about a 16-year-old patient who sexually assaulted his younger next-door neighbour after becoming addicted to porn. ‘All day he was thinking about the imagery,’ he said. ‘He felt he was losing touch with reality. The relief only came when he switched his computer back on again.’ Gail Dines, professor of sociology and women’s studies at Wheelock College in Boston, said: ‘Asking a family to deal with the porn use of their child is like telling a mother that their children should not breathe in pollution.’","Web security firm Kaspersky said 23 per cent of blocked searches in the UK were for porn and recorded 25million attempts to access porn globally .

Still at it: Gangster 'Mad' Frankie Fraser, 89, has been given an ASBO for arguing at his care home . He was jailed for the first time  at 13, after stealing a packet of cigarettes. More than seven decades later, it seems ‘Mad’ Frankie Fraser has no intention of giving up his notorious career of crime. The East End gangster, now 89, was given an Asbo for arguing with another pensioner at his care home. His son, David, said staff called police because they feared the ‘screaming and shouting’ would escalate. He explained yesterday: ‘They were always rowing and it ended up with the police being called. 'The other man had dementia and was not all there. All he did was bark back at him. ‘He said it was about rowing as they were all screaming and shouting at each other. 'My dad ended up with an Asbo, but he was not the only person to get one. He laughed about it. 'They said it was effectively a warning. It didn’t make much difference to him and he carried on as he normally did. It was a really funny turnout.' The anti-social behaviour order was issued two years ago after Fraser was admitted to sheltered accommodation in Bermondsey, South East London, when living alone became ‘too much for him’, his family said. Frail: Fraser (centre) attends the funeral of his former gangland boss Charlie Richardson last October . Reunion: Frankie had connections with the Krays. Here he is pictured greeting Reggie Kray at the funeral of his older brother Charles Junior in 2000 . History: As well as knowing the Krays, Fraser dated Marilyn Wisbey (pictured with him in 1997) - daughter of Great Train Robber Tom Wisbey. The picture to the right shows him in 1956 before he was jailed for seven years . Fraser is one of the last surviving . ‘celebrity criminals’. He has spent 42 years – almost half his life – in . prison for 26 offences. He was a member of the Richardson gang, and widely feared in London’s underworld. Yesterday David said his father was in poor health, and described the Asbo as ‘like something out of a comedy sketch’. Fraser now lives in another nursing home in Southwark, just a few miles from his regular haunts during his criminal career. His son added: ‘There are no problems . now and the other people in the home are very protective of him. He’s . quite popular among them because he likes to treat them if he gets a few . quid.

A Minnesota appellate court upheld the conviction of a domestic violence victim who was charged with a DWI after fleeing her husband while drunk. Jennifer Marie Axelberg appealed her conviction on the grounds that she was fleeing for her life from her abusive husband, but the Minnesota Court of Appeals refused such a 'necessity defense' on Monday, saying Axelberg was risking her own injury and that of others by driving while intoxicated, according to KMSP-TV. Axelberg was charged for driving while intoxicated and her license was revoked after she drove with a .18 blood alcohol level to flee her husband who had just hit her twice in the head. Defense: Jennifer Marie Axelberg, left, said she drove while intoxicated because she was afraid her husband Jason Axelberg, right, was going to hit her again . Shattered: Jason Axelberg, left, was arrested after hitting his wife Jennifer Marie Axelberg and smashing her car's windshield, right, when she tried to flee for her life . The 'necessity defense' is often applied in cases where victims injure their attackers or homeowners hurt intruders. To successfully use such a defense, Axelberg had to prove she had no option but to break the law and that she would have been injured if she didn't drive drunk. In May 2011, she and and her husband Jason Axelberg were on vacation when they got into a spat after drinking. They were at their family cabin near Mora, Minn., when Mr Axelberg pushed his wife in the chest and hit her head twice. Fearing more abuse, Axelberg got into the car and locked the doors. Her husband climbed onto her car and smashed her windshield. Thinking he might get in the car and hurt her, Axelberg drove away—even though she was drunk. Someone called police and Mr Axelberg was arrested for domestic assault and disorderly conduct. He pleaded guilty to both charges later. But Axelberg was also arrested and her license was revoked. While Axelberg's license has since been reinstated, she's been trying to clear her record 'out of principle', KMSP-TV reported. The district court refused the necessity defense and the Minnesota Court of Appeals upheld the district court's decision on Monday. Reconciled: Jennifer Axelberg, top left center, and her husband Jason Axelberg, top right center, are back together and sober after Mr Axelberg was arrested for domestic violence . In the majority opinion of the court, Judge Randolph W Peterson did acknowledge Axelberg was threatened with physical harm, but he concludes she only created more risk to herself and others by driving intoxicated. 'Appellant was threatened with physical injury by her husband,' Peterson said. 'But, by driving while impaired, appellant created the very risk of physical injury to herself and to other highway users that the implied-consent statute is intended to prevent.' In a dissenting opinion, Judge Margaret H Chutich wrote that 'Axelberg reasonably feared for her safety'. 'A review of the district court record suggests that Axelberg had ""no legal alternative to breaking the law,"" ""the harm to be prevented [was] imminent,"" and ""a direct, causal connection [existed] between breaking the law and preventing the harm,""' Chutich wrote. '...I would therefore reverse the district court's decision and remand for further findings on whether the facts of Axelberg's case meet the demanding requirements of the necessity defense.' Axelberg's attorney, Ryan M Pacyga, is planning on filing an appeal with the state Supreme Court. Axelberg and her husband have since reconciled and are both sober. She told City Pages last summer that she still thinks she made the right decision. 'I'm alive today,' she said. Mr Axelberg also told City Page that if she didn't drive away, 'probably would've hit her more'.","A woman has lost her case arguing that she only drove after consuming alcohol because she was fleeing an abusive husband .

Libraries should pay authors a fair sum each time they lend out an e-book or writers will go bust, a leading novelist claimed today. Philip Pullman, best-selling writer of the His Dark Materials children's fantasy trilogy, says authors could lose up to two-thirds of their income and even be forced to give up writing altogether if hard copies of books in libraries are replaced by e-books. A new reporty by the Society of Authors, of which Mr Pullman is President-elect, warns: 'There is a risk that e-books have the potential to undermine the perceived value of books generally to a point below which [writing] ceases to be commercially valuable. 'The risk is even higher with e-lending.' Author Philip Pullman says writers must be paid fairly when e-books of their work are borrowed from libraries . As President-elect of the Society of . Authors, Mr Pullman is leading a campaign to force publishers and the . Government to make sure writers are paid properly when electronic . versions of their work are borrowed from public libraries. E-books are a growing trend, with consumer sales up more than 130 per cent last year.  The Society of Authors estimates that more than half a million e-books were lent out through libraries in the first 10 months of last year. But, the society says, authors are not seeing income from that stream. Under the current royalty system, authors are paid about 6p by the Government each time a paper version of their book is borrowed from a library, but paid nothing when a e-version is borrowed. The society has also discovered that publishers may be unintentionally underpaying writers for e-book loans, meaning they could be losing out twice over. Mr Pullman said: 'New media and new forms of buying and lending are all very interesting, for all kinds of reasons, but one principle remains unchanged: authors must be paid fairly for their work. 'Any arrangement that doesn't acknowledge that principle is a bad one, and needs to be changed. That is our whole argument.' Philip Pullman's award-winning His Dark Materials trilogy includes Northern Lights and The Amber Spyglass . The society, which was founded in . 1884 and has more than 9,000 members, says publishers must reimburse . writers who have been underpaid, with interest on what they are owed, . and ensure that publishing contracts are correctly interpreted so . writers are paid what they are due in future. It also wants the Government to ensure e-books are covered by the Public Lending Right (PLR) scheme. In a report out today, the society says most authors - for whom the average wage is £12,000 - already 'struggle to make ends meet', adding: . 'Advances have fallen while more unpaid work is expected of authors in marketing and publicising their work, including appearances and use of social media.' The report adds: 'PLR provides a significant and much-valued part of many authors' incomes...It amounts to a total of around £6m per year.' Anne Sebba, chairman of the society's management committee, said: 'Authors are keen to embrace the opportunities offered by digital publishing and want to support libraries by offering their eBooks for lending. 'However, we need to ensure that authors are paid sufficient money from digital to enable them to keep writing.'","Philip Pullman leading campaign to ensure writers are paid for e-books .

Oxygen tanks sit in one corner, while a drip stand is set up in another. But in the chaotic, hospital-like room in which Michael Jackson died, the oddest thing of all is behind that drip stand – an apparent shrine for babies. New photographs released of the singer’s huge and ornately decorated bedroom at his Los Angeles mansion reveal a dresser top crammed with portraits of unidentified young children. Across the front is a placard bearing a photograph of a smiling little boy and the caption ‘sweet baby’. Some of the images on the dresser top have been turned into plates. The identities of the babies are unclear, although at least some of the pictures may be of Jackson’s three children – Prince, Paris and Blanket. The pictures, released this week by Los Angeles police, have been shown to jurors considering a multi-million pound compensation claim by Jackson’s mother, Katherine, against his tour promoters AEG Live. She claims the company failed to investigate properly Jackson’s personal doctor, Conrad Murray, and missed warning signs about the singer’s health before his death in 2009. Numbing: Local anaesthetic Lidocaine, used to lessen the pain of injections . Murray was jailed for four years for involuntary manslaughter in 2011 after giving Jackson, 50, a lethal dose of the powerful hypnotic anaesthetic Propofol. Drug addiction: King of pop Michael Jackson . Some pictures showing the shocking state of Jackson’s bedroom were released at Murray’s trial. But these new photographs reveal the true extent of his tragic decline into prescription drug dependency. Bottles of Propofol were found all over the bedroom. An empty one was lying discarded on the floor, along with a used bottle of flumazenil. The latter is used to offset the excessive drowsiness brought on by other drugs Jackson was taking. A list of nearby 24-hour pharmacies was also found in the room. The trial is revealing new evidence of the extent to which Jackson’s medical care was alarming those around him. On Monday, jurors were shown an email from Randy Phillips, the chief executive of AEG Live. In it he expressed serious concerns about the treatment Jackson was receiving from his dermatologist, Arnold Klein. The company was ‘scared to death’ of drug injections he was receiving, Mr Phillips wrote. The email was sent in response to a £33,000 medical bill Mr Klein had sent to Jackson’s manager. The treatments included shots of cosmetic drugs including Restalyne and Botox, as well as other unidentified intra-muscular injections.","Photos of the singer's Los Angeles mansion reveal his chaotic bedroom .

Children whose mothers work during their early years do not fare worse at school, according to comprehensive new research. The study found no link between mothers who continue their careers and children performing less well academically – debunking a common parenting myth. The research analysed six different studies over the past four decades looking at around 40,000 children. The report attributed the academic improvement in children with working mothers to better childcare . It showed that children born since the mid-90s whose mothers worked during their early years fared just as well as those whose mothers did not. However, those born to career mothers in the 1970s, 80s and early 90s did suffer a disadvantage, according to the research. Children born in 2000 or 2001 showed no significant difference in cognitive ability or behaviour at the age of five whether their mothers had gone out to work or not in their first year. Studies of previous decades showed children’s literacy and numeracy levels were around two percentage points lower when mothers worked. Parenting groups said the report should ‘put an end to some of the emotional baggage’ for mothers deciding whether or not to return to work. Fiona Weir, chief executive of the single-parent charity Gingerbread, said: ‘It’s clear that the changes in maternity leave and greater availability of childcare have played a big role in enabling parents to balance work and family. The report comes as Parliament debates proposals to cut the ratio of childcare workers to children . ‘However, for single parents in particular, the crippling cost of childcare and a shortage of family-friendly jobs are making it very difficult for those who do want to return to work.’ The report’s authors attributed the improvement in the academic performances of children with working mothers to the expansion of childcare in the 1990s. Professor Heather Joshi, of the University of London’s Centre for Longitudinal Studies, told the Independent: ‘There has traditionally been a concern that the employment of mothers comes at the expense of child development. ‘But as the percentage of mothers in work has gone up, any impact on children has diminished. ‘The most obvious thing that changed in the 90s was the New Labour government, which started taking childcare seriously as an area of public concern. ‘In the 80s, childcare was either something that only very rich families could purchase or very poor families got offered because their child was at risk, so everyone else in the middle had to make do with informal arrangements.’ The report comes as Parliament debates controversial proposals to cut the ratio of childcare workers to children. And Prof Joshi warned the proposals could reverse the progress evidenced in the report. She added: ‘This wouldn’t have happened without a big expansion of childcare and if anything happens to funds available for childcare, there may be consequences.’ Sharon Hodgson, shadow children's minister, said the research demonstrated the ‘great strides’ Labour made in raising the quality of childcare. She added: ‘The Government’s plans to cut the number of staff needed to look after children risk putting those improvements into reverse.’ The research will be presented in central London today at a Campaign for Social Science event on longitudinal studies attended by universities and science minister, David Willetts. On the proposed childcare reforms, a Department for Education spokeswoman said: ‘Parents want to be able to go out to work confident in the knowledge that their children are being well looked after. ‘Quality is central to our childcare reforms which will give parents more choice and ensure their young children have the best start in life.’","No link between career mothers and child's school performance, study finds .

A popular Jeep off-roader favoured by thousands of British school-run families is at the centre of a major fire safety row after U.S. officials blamed it for more than 50 deaths. Car bosses have refused U.S. government demands to recall nearly three million of the 4X4s over 'deadly problems'. Defiant Chrysler is refusing to recall about 2.7 million of the Jeeps which safety officials says are at risk of a fuel tank fire in a rear-end collision. The siting of the 4X4s fuel tank is a 'defect' which poses an 'unreasonable risk to safety,' say safety chiefs – a charge which Chrysler rejects. Some 23,511 of the Jeep Grand Cherokees made between 1993 and 2004 are still on the road in the UK . The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has now sent Chrysler a letter asking that the company voluntarily recall Jeep Grand Cherokees - which were also sold in Britain – between 1993  and 2004. Some 23,511 of the Jeep Grand Cherokees from this period are still on the road in the UK, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and traders. The recall request also affects the Jeep Liberty built between 2002 and 2007, which was not sold in the UK. NHTSA found at least 32 rear-impact crashes and fires in Grand Cherokees that caused 44 deaths. It also found at least five rear crashes in Libertys, causing seven deaths. The fire row between Chrysler, its parent company Fiat, and government safety chiefs was the lead item on prime time news broadcasts in the U.S., including ABC News. Chrysler Group LLC, which is now majority-owned by Italy's Fiat SpA insisted in a statement on Tuesday that the Jeeps are safe and it 'does not intend to recall the vehicles'. Such a refusal by a car company is rare. And though the NHTSA can order a recall but needs a court order to enforce it. David Strickland, the safety agency's administrator, said in a statement that he hopes Chrysler will reconsider its decision. Will it be recalled? The 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited . Chrysler Group LLC, which is now majority-owned by Italy's Fiat SpA insisted in a statement on Tuesday that the Jeeps are safe . 'Our data shows that these vehicles may contain a defect that presents an unreasonable risk to safety,' he said. U.S. car safety chiefs opened an investigation into the Jeeps in August 2010 at the request of the Center for Auto Safety in Washington. They found that the Jeeps' fuel tanks can fail when hit from the rear, leak fuel and cause fires if there's an ignition source. The positioning of the tanks behind the rear axle and their height above the road is a design defect,  it said in a letter to Chrysler dated Monday. Chrysler moved the fuel tanks on the Grand Cherokee ahead of the rear axle in 2005, and did the same thing with the Liberty in 2007. NHTSA said the older Jeeps performed poorly when compared with all but one similar vehicle from the 1993 to 2007 model years: 'Particularly in terms of fatalities, fires without fatalities, and fuel leaks in rear-end impacts and crashes.' The agency calculated that the older Grand Cherokees and Libertys have fatal crash rates that are about double those of similar vehicles. It asks Chrysler to recall the vehicles and 'implement a remedy action that improves their performance in rear-impacts and crashes'. Car-makers  usually agree to a recall request, partly to avoid bad publicity. In the last three years, Chrysler has conducted 52 recalls. But Chrysler insists  its review of nearly 30 years of data shows a low number of rear-impact crashes involving fire or a fuel leak in the affected Jeeps and that the the recall request  is based on an 'incomplete analysis of the underlying data'. Chrysler Group LLC chairman and chief executive Sergio Marchionne insisted: 'The company stands behind the quality of its vehicles. 'All of us remain committed to continue working with NHTSA to provide information confirming the safety of these vehicles.' The row comes as Chrysler prepares to launch the latest new generation of its Jeep Grand Cherokee which is unaffected by the safety scare. 'NHTSA seems to be holding Chrysler Group to a new standard for fuel tank integrity that does not exist now and did not exist when the Jeep vehicles were manufactured,' the company said. The dispute leaves owners of the affected Grand Cherokees and Libertys waiting for government or court action. It also leaves Chrysler open to the risk of big liability if there are more crashes and injuries linked to the fuel tanks, said Logan Robinson, a University of Detroit Mercy law professor and former Chrysler corporate counsel. Lawyers could argue that if Chrysler had recalled the Jeeps, people wouldn't have been hurt, he said. But that liability would be limited if Chrysler beats NHTSA in court and a judge rules the company didn't sell defective vehicles, said Robinson. Chrysler called the older Grand Cherokees and Libertys 'among the safest vehicles of their era'  saying they met all federal safety standards in effect when they were built. NHTSA's letter concedes this but adds: 'The existence of a minimum standard does not require NHTSA to ignore deadly problems.' Chrysler has until June 18 to respond to the safety administration's letter. NHTSA has the authority to fine companies if slow to provide data or recall vehicles. The agency fined Toyota Motor Corp. a record $66million for failing to quickly report problems and for delaying a recall. Toyota paid the fine without admitting it violated the law.","Car bosses refuse demands to recall nearly three million 4X4s .

City watchdogs are probing allegations that foreign exchange rates are being rigged by traders. The accusations are a fresh blow to financial markets already embroiled in the Libor rate-fixing scandal - which has seen Barclays and RBS handed heavy fines . The market in natural gas faces a probe into manipulation of prices, and questions have been raised over oil and petrol prices. The £3trillion a day foreign exchange rate market is not regulated but the big players like banks are supervised by the Financial Conduct Authority. A spokesman for the watchdog said: 'We are looking into this but we can't comment any further at this moment'. The Bloomberg story reports claims that bank employees have been 'front-running' client orders and rigging WM/Reuters foreign exchange rates by pushing through trades before and during 60-second windows when benchmarks are set. Whistleblowing traders say that the alleged practices have been occurring on a daily basis for at least a decade, and have affected the value of funds and the complex financial instruments known as derivatives, according to Bloomberg. It also quotes an industry insider who likens the foreign exchange market to 'the Wild West'. RBS also had to stump up £390million for its part in the Libor scandal . While rates are not followed by ordinary investors directly, they are used by fund managers to calculate their holdings and index providers like FTSE Group and MSCI to track stocks and bonds. This means their movements can affect the value of pension and savings accounts. Barclays was hit with a £290million fine for manipulating the Libor interest rate last summer, when lurid emails were released showing how its traders boasted about their activities. RBS also had to stump up £390million for its part in the scandal. Meanwhile, BP and Royal Dutch Shell saw their offices raided last month as the European Commission launched an investigation into oil price fixing. The Commission said it was concerned there has been collusion aimed at manipulating the prices of not only oil, but also petrol and biofuels. Energy companies are also being investigated after accusations by a whistleblower that traders manipulated the wholesale gas price to boost profits, potentially pushing household bills higher.","Bank staff accused of making trades before processing customer orders .

Four women found dead last week at a crime-plagued Tulsa, Oklahoma, apartment complex were each killed by a gunshot wound to the head, according to the state's Medical Examiner's Office. Full autopsy reports are still pending in the gruesome massacre of 23-year-old twin sisters Rebeika Powell and Kayetie Melchor, 33-year-old Misty Nunley and 55-year-old Julie Jackson. Investigators have not revealed how the women knew each other or why they may have been targeted. Mystery: Police have not yet determined a suspect or a motive in the killings, which occurred in a crime-ridden area of Tulsa . Joseph Tillman, 33, was arrested on January 8 on unrelated charges but police claim he is 'at a minimum' a witness in the apartment shooting. He was taken into custody during a traffic stop in Independence, Kansas, on an outstanding warrant for a domestic assault and battery case. He hasn't been charged or arrested in . the quadruple murder, though a judge increased his bond on Wednesday from . $11,000 to $250,000. He is being held on unrelated charges in the Tulsa County jail. Police told the Tulsa World last week . that Tillman has been 'known to frequent' the 61st Street and Peoria . Avenue area, a crime-ridden location and the scene of the horrific . murders. Caught: Joseph Tillman, a 'person of interest' in the grisly murder, was taken into custody on January 8 in Kansas . The man's arrest came just after a mother of one of the victims spoke out about how her daughter was getting her life back together when it was tragically cut short. Misty Nunley's mother, Cheryl Nunley, . said her 33-year-old daughter had befriended Rebeika Powell and had been . staying with her on and off in the apartment for the week preceding the . slayings. Back on track: The mother of Misty Nunley, pictured, said her 33-year-old daughter was putting her life back together . She said she called her daughter nearly every morning to check in, and spoke to her on January 7 - just hours before the women were found shot to death. 'She had positive people back in her . life,' Cheryl Nunley told The Associated Press, holding back tears while . sitting with family and friends in a tiny apartment a few blocks away . from the crime scene. 'She's not perfect. She ran around . with some people she shouldn't have been running around with, but she . was getting her life back together.' Misty Nunley was found murdered along with the twins - both mothers of young children - and Julie Jackson, 55. Also in the apartment was a 3-year-old boy who is believed to have witnessed the entire shooting. He was unharmed. Detectives and officers were 'beating the bushes' to figure out what happened, police spokesman Leland Ashley said last week.

Rescue: A man has died after his car went off a cliff and landed at the water's edge in Newquay, Cornwall, this morning . The car landed near a lifeboat slipway and a group of caves known as the Tea Caverns. Residents said the man must have driven through a pay-and-display car park and then off a path in order to reach the spot.

He looked like he had a lot of facial injuries and the structure of the car was really messed up.' It is not known exactly when the car plunged from the sheer cliffs and formal identification has not taken place. The kayaker added: 'The next thing I get over to the car and there's a young lad hanging out the passenger side window. 'The air con sounded like it was still running and the wind screen wipers were going. I shouted to him to try and get a response but there was nothing so I dialled 999 straight away.

A hairdresser on a night out suffered 'terrifying' burns after drinking a girly cocktail which had been contaminated with bleach. Lauren Murphy says she thought she was going to die after she took a sip of the 'pink kangaroo' drink while celebrating her mother's 50th birthday in a Tyneside bar. She and her friends have now received a pay-out from the insurers of the bar responsible, more than two years after their harrowing ordeal. Ordeal: Lauren Murphy was poisoned by a cocktail which had been contaminated by bleach . Miss Murphy, 22, was out with her mother and friends in February 2011 at the Raffles and Dantes bar in South Shields, which has since closed down. One of the group ordered a pink kangaroo, made with tequila, vodka, cider, cranberry juice and orange juice. Tests later established that the drink had been contaminated with bleach, which is frequently used for cleaning bar pipes. One woman vomited immediately after taking a gulp, while others suffered throat burns and ran to the toilet to wash out their mouths. Miss Murphy said: 'I went in the toilets and my friend was nearly passed out because she had swallowed her sip all the way down. 'The police were called and I gave my drink to the officer. By this time everyone was getting burns and I had bleach stains on my black dress. 'Three ambulances turned up and they shut the bar and we were taken to hospital.' Night out: The incident took place at Raffles and Dantes bar in South Shields, pictured, which is now closed . She took more than a month to recover from the poisoning, and has suffered from heartburn ever since. 'I couldn't swallow properly for six weeks,' she added. 'My mouth was swollen and my tongue piercing became all shiny. 'It felt like a ball of fire inside, it was terrifying - I thought I was going to die.' Five women won £2,500 compensation each from the bar's insurer in an out-of-court settlement. Their lawyer Steven Thomson said: 'We are delighted to have secured a settlement on behalf of our clients but disappointed a settlement could not have been reached without us having to issue court proceedings. 'As a result, this process has taken far longer than it ought to have done, but at least now my clients can put this horrendous incident behind them. 'Many tens of thousands of drinks are bought on Tyneside every weekend and in each case, the customer puts their trust in the bar or pub that the product will be safe to drink. 'I hope lessons will be learned from this incident that the safety of customers always has to be at the very top of the list of priorities.'","Lauren Murphy, 22, was at South Shields bar celebrating mother's birthday .

The princess managed to convince the officer who pulled her over on Tuesday that her car had special permission to use bus lanes.

'Or if there . could be an exception for cars from the Royal Court driving in the . public lanes' She now faces a fine of 1,000 krona (£100) on the basis that only her father,  the king of Sweden King Carl XVI Gustaf, has immunity in such cases. However, according to the Aftonbladet newspaper, the controversy is not yet over. Royal . Court spokesman Bertil Ternert argued that even though Madeleine . herself does not have immunity, her royal car has special permission to . use the public transit lanes.

Forget about demolishing that glass ceiling — women in the Senate are finally getting a much-needed update to their bathroom. Female senators have been forced to share a two-stall facility for 20 years, causing lines and headaches. But now that the Senate boasts 20 lady lawmakers, construction crews will expand the small bathroom after August recess, The Washington Post reported. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat from New Hampshire, tweeted the renovations were 'a sign of the progress we are making'. Historic: The Senate is getting a new, larger bathroom for this Congress' record number of female lawmakers . 'We’re even going to have a window,' Shaheen told the Post. Ever since their numbers increased, the small size of the bathroom—the only one located just off the floor—became a 'running joke' for the group of senators, the Post said. 'For the first time, there was a traffic jam in the Senate women’s bathroom,' Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, said a week after the election according to the Post. 'There were five of us in there, and there are only two stalls.' Klobuchar added the increase in female senators was 'wonderful', adding the group has dinners every other month. The New York Times reported the group is even using the bathroom problem to their advantage. Sen. Debbie Stabenow, a Democrat from Michigan, said that she and Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat from North Dakota, strategized on a new farm bill while waiting in line. 'It’s a good problem to have,' Stebenow told the Times. 'We have enough of us now that we can negotiate in the ladies' room.' Women have come a long way since the first female senator was elected in 1922. Progress: Female senators have been forced to share a small, two-stall bathroom just off the Senate floor since 1993 . When Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington state, was sworn-in 20 years ago, females didn't even have the cramped bathroom. She told seattlepi.com that the only bathroom off the Senate floor was for men. 'We had to go upstairs and down a long hall,' Murray said. Eventually in 1993 a small, two-stall, restroom was constructed using space in from the men's facility, according to the Times. It was bearable when there were less than 10 female senators. 'It’s no longer convenient: There’s a line,' Murray told seattlepi.com. The women in the House of Representatives got their own update in 2011, when Speaker John A. Boehner, an Ohio Republican, directed the Architect of the Capitol to construct a female restroom adjacent to the House floor. Before construction, female representatives had to walk 'the length of a football field' for a toilet, according to the Times. 'It’s terrific to have this here,' Rep. Virginia Foxx, a .

Prosecutors are still seeking the death penalty for Jodi Arias despite a jury being unable to reach a verdict on whether she should be executed. Arias, a former waitress from California, . was found guilty last month of killing Travis Alexander, whose body was . found slumped in the shower of his Phoenix-area home in June 2008. He . had been stabbed 27 times, had his throat slashed and was shot in the . face. Prosecutors have revealed they will still pursue a death penalty for Jodi Arias, pictured here before the jury's non-decision in her sentencing was handed down . Arias says the killing was self-defense, and that on the day of Alexander's death, he attacked her and she was forced to fight for her life. However, no other evidence - other than Arias' accounts - has been presented at trial showing Alexander had ever been physically violent. Authorities say Arias planned the attack. She initially denied involvement then blamed it on masked intruders. Two years after her arrest, she said it was self-defense. Following the deadlock, the jury foreman claimed he is has been threatened with hate mail, with strangers saying they will kill him for failing to sentence Arias to death. 'Today I read hate mail my dad had gotten,' the son of foreman William Zervakos wrote on his blog. 'Some person had sent him a threatening message complete with his email address, full name, and phone number (which at the very least means that this guy should retake Hate Mail 101).' Heartbroken: Travis Alexander's relatives, including his sister Tanisha (right) were a constant presence at the trial and they were moved to tears when they heard that it would drag on for more months . The state of Arizona now has the . option of retrying the sentencing phase of the trial, which would . require a new jury be empanelled, NBCNews.com reported. If there is another deadlock, a judge . would sentence Arias to natural life in prison, or life with the . possibility of parole after 25 years. Maricopa County Attorney Bill . Montgomery told reporters prosecutors would ask a new sentencing jury to . do what the previous one could not - put Arias to death. 'At this point, we are still preparing to move forward to retry the penalty phase,' Montgomery told a news conference. New target: William 'Bill' Zervakos has received death threats in the wake of the Jodi Arias trail where he and the other jury members failed to punish her with the death penalty . Mr Zervakos has previously explained that the jury aced a decision that was wrenching and real, with implications that could haunt them forever. He said the jury struggled with one . specific question in their private deliberations: How heinous of a . killing deserves a similar fate? 'The . system we think is flawed in that sense because this was not a case of a . Jeffrey Dahmer or Charles Manson,' Zervakos told The Associated Press. 'It was a brutal no-win situation. ... I think that's kind of unfair,' the 69-year-old added. 'We're . not lawyers. We can't interpret the law. We're mere mortals. And I will . tell you I've never felt more mere as a mortal than I felt for the last . five months.' Zervakos . said the most difficult time of the entire trial was hearing directly . from victim's family as his brother and sister tearfully explained how . his killing has shattered their lives. 'There was no sound in that jury room for a long time after that because you hurt so bad for these people,' he said. 'But that wasn't evidence. That's what . made it so hard.... This wasn't about them. This was a decision whether . we're going to tell somebody they were going to be put to death or . spend the rest of their life in prison.' Zervakos . described a deliberations room full of tears and spinning moral . compasses as each juror struggled to come to grips with their own . beliefs about what factors - including Arias' young age at the time of . the killing and her lack of criminal history - should cause them to show . mercy and spare her life. 'You've . got Travis Alexander's family devastated, that he was killed, that he . was brutally killed. You've got Jodi Arias' family sitting in there, . both families sitting and seeing these humiliating images and listening . to unbelievably lurid private details of their lives, and you've got a . woman whose life is over, too,' Zervakos said. 'I mean, who's winning in this situation? And we were stuck in the middle.' Zervakos . declined to discuss his thoughts or those of other jurors on whether . Arias should have been sentenced to death or life. But he said he was . torn between her two personas: a killer and an average young woman . struggling through life. 'You heard (prosecutor Juan) Martinez say she was only 27.... She's old enough that she should have known better,' Zervakos said. 'I didn't look at it that way. I'm looking at 27 years of an absolutely normal everyday young woman that was living a life that was perfectly normal. 'Then something changed the trajectory of her life after meeting Travis Alexander, and it spiraled downhill from there.'","State of Arizona now has the .

A Kentucky family has spoken out against the thieves who ransacked their home while they were attending their murdered son's funeral. Cindy and Dennis Higdon were already heartbroken from the tragic death of their 20-year-old son when they came home to find thieves had taken some of his keepsakes along with jewelry, guns and laptops. Police said these heartless criminals are part of a growing trend of thieves who stalk the local obituaries to discover when families won't be home, according to TODAY. Kentucky men Michael Acord, 41, and Timothy Terry, 44, are currently locked up for breaking into the Higdon's home last June while the family was in mourning. Police believe the pair found their target in the local paper's obituary of Christian Higdon, 20, who was murdered last summer. Heartless: After Christian Higdon, pictured with his son Jayden Eli, was murdered in June 2012, his parents came home to find their home had been burgled . Criminals: Michael Acord, left, and Timothy . Terry, right, are currently serving time for stealing from the Higdons' home while they were at their son's funeral . Acord and Terry were arrested after they pawned items stolen from the Higdons, according to the Kentucky State Police. Another man, James Parrett, 43, is also serving time for pawning items stolen from another Kentucky woman in who was at her husband's funeral during the crime. Police said several firearms, medication knives and at least 30 gold pocket watches were taken from Normalee Skees' home in March 2012. 'It's like, you already felt like you're at the lowest point you could be and ... it's like I just fell to the ground,' Cindy Higdon told TODAY. Christian, of Clarkson, Ky., died of blunt force trauma on an early afternoon last June, according to the Grayson County News Gazette. Police believe he was bludgeoned to death with the blunt side of a hatchet by 25-year-old Jamie Byon Columbus Wagers after an argument in Elizabethtown, Ky. Wagers pleaded not guilty to murder and his trial is set to begin this August, according to court records. In several news reports, family members said Christian struggled with drug use. He was one of five children the Higdon's have adopted and the second to die young. When she was nine, Jenna Higdon died in a car accident, they told WHASS11. He was survived by a young son. Happier times: After their son Christian, top middle, was murdered, theives targeted Dennis and Cindy Higdon, top right . Murdered: Christian Higdon, 20, left, was . murdered with a hatchet, police said. Jamie Byon Columbus Wagers, right, . is on trial for murder in August . Christian's obituary was published in a local paper, The News-Enterprise, on June 19, 2012. Listing visitation, funeral and prayer service times for the following day, police said the obituary made it easy for Acord and Terry to target the Hidgon's home. 'It is a sick feeling to think that that person sat and literally watched us go through hell,' Cindy Higdon told WHAS11. 'Stuff strewn everywhere, they went through everything we own, every cabinet, everything we own,' Dennis Higdon said. Kentucky State Police said a jewelry box, four long guns, two frills, a GPS, three laptops, an Xbox 360 Kinect, a Nintendo Wii game console and a few hundred dollars were taken from the Higdon's home. The thieves were nabbed when Acord tried to pawn an item with a serial number at Elizabethtown Dixie Jewelry and Loan. An employee, Tyler Wright, told WAVE News the serial number was entered in an internal database and he called the police. 'It makes us feel great knowing we're able to help catch the bad apples,' Wright said. When Acord and Terry were arrested, everything was returned but one laptop, according to WAVE News. Robber: James Parrett is serving time in Kentucky for stealing from a widow while she was at her husband's funeral . 'It was very rewarding to call the Higdon family and be able to tell them that we got most of their stuff back and arrested those responsible for their break-in,' Kentucky State Police Det. Ryan Johnson said in a statement. 'Many of the items stolen were sentimental to them and were reminders of their son, Christian. They were pleased to say the least.' 'It's an awesome sense of relief knowing these guys are arrested,' Dennis Higdon told WAVE News. 'Not only for ourselves, but for other who have been in the same situation.' Skees, whose home was burgled after her husband died, said: 'I am very relieved that they were caught.' During and after the investigation, police called the crime 'pathetic', describing the thieves as 'low lives'. 'It's pathetic that people have to stoop to that level. Especially when a family is in a time of mourning,' Norman Chaffins, of the Kentucky State Police told WDRB. 'Taking them and basically kicking someone while they're down. I think in both of these cases, that's exactly what they did.' Tragedy: The thieves stole some keepsakes Christian Higdon's family were using to remember their son . After the burglaries, local residents began to watch their neighbors' homes during funerals, WDRB reported. But police said the problem might be more widespread. Near Seattle, Wash., thieves broke into 10 homes while families were attending funerals, amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars stolen, according to TODAY. 'It's heinous,' said Det. Margaret Ludwig from Snohomish County, which investigated so-called 'obituary burglarers' in the area in April 2012. 'It's reprehensible.' Police are now advising grieving families to publish less personal information in obituaries or have a friend stay at the home during the funeral services. 'It's like, please, have a heart,' Cindy Higdon told TODAY. 'I mean, think about the people you're doing this to, what they're already going through.'","Kentucky residents Cindy and Dennis Higdon came home after their son's funeral to find jewelry, guns and electronics missing .

Charges: Yoselyn Ortega, 50, is charged with murdering two-year-old Leo and six-year-old Lulu last October . A nanny accused of stabbing two young children to death in an Upper West Side apartment has claimed someone else killed them. Yoselyn Ortega, 50, is charged with murdering two-year-old Leo and six-year-old Lulu last October. Police said they found Ortega in the bathroom of her employer's Manhattan apartment with the children's bodies nearby in a pool of blood. Ortega had stabbed herself in the throat. 'I didn’t do that,' Yoselyn Ortega insisted in jailhouse interview with New York Daily News. 'Someone else did.' Ortega, who worked as nanny for Marina and Kevin Krim, did not say who else could be responsible for murdering the children. Ortega, Lucia and Leo had been due to . meet Mrs Krim and Nessie at a dance studio, but the mother became . concerned when they failed to turn up and returned to the home. After learning from the doorman that . the nanny had not left the building, Mrs Krim frantically searched the . apartment and came across the grisly scene in the bathroom. Ortega's suicide bid failed and she was put in a medically-induced coma. When . questioned by police after awaking from the coma, the nanny attempted . to paint Mrs Krim in a bad light, shifting part of the blame for the . tragedy on her. Ortega, . who had told neighbors and family that she was short of money, revealed . she resented her employers because they kept telling her what to do and . asked her to do the housework. Plea: Jocelyn Ortega, pictured centre, has pleaded not guilty to killing six-year-old Lucia Krim (right) and her two-year-old brother Leo while they were in her care at their Manhattan home . 'She said something like, ""I'm paid . to watch the children, not clean up and do housework"",' a . law-enforcement source said of Ortega’s statements to police after she . woke from the coma. Yoselyn became extremely animated . when she discussed the incident with police, telling officers that  she . had numerous disagreements with mother Marina about how the kids were . being cared for. Reports claimed Marina didn't think . Yoselyn was interacting with the kids enough and was giving them junk . food. Loss: Two-year-old Leo and his big sister Lulu, six, were found in a pool of blood in the family's home . Victims: Only Nessie, whose picture has been pixelated, escaped harm as she was with her mother . The Krims were also reportedly worried about Ortega's job . performance in the weeks leading up to the killings and had told her . that if she didn't improve, they might need to replace her. But the Krims' extended family . dispute they treated her poorly, explaining that they paid for her to . travel on holidays and even visited her family in the Dominican . Republic. In April, Ortega, was ruled fit to . stand trial and will now face a jury for two counts of first-degree . murder and two counts of second-degree murder. She has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Family: Lulu is pictured with her father Kevin Krim and mother Marina Krim, who found her children stabbed in the bathtub and their nanny with a slit throat and wrists on the bathroom floor . Last month the Krim's revealed they are expecting a baby boy in October, . 'Hello everyone, We are very happy to let you know that Marina is expecting a baby in the fall,' read the message on the Lulu & Leo Fund. 'Nessie can’t wait to welcome her new baby brother. We are filled with many emotions as we look to the future, but the most important one is hope. We are very grateful to you all for your amazing support.' In January, Mr Krim, an executive at America's CNBC television station, said that they are drawing strength from their remaining child. He said: 'Marina and I couldn't be more proud of her - she is very smart, beautiful and tough. And she's grown so much over the past two months. She saves us every day.'

'With the building collapse a week ago, we have now lost seven lives in connection with this tragedy,' Deputy Mayor Everett Gillison said at a news conference, adding that Wagenhoffer leaves behind a wife and son. He added: 'This man did nothing wrong. The department did what it was supposed to do.' Department employees were informed of the death Thursday morning. Wagenhoffer was a 16-year city employee who had started with the Department of Public Property and worked his way up through the ranks to building inspector, according to city officials. He had worked until 3pm. Wednesday. The department’s head, Carlton Williams, said Wagenhoffer did everything he could to protect people. 'We strive to protect our citizens by enforcing the building codes. And that’s what Ron did,' Williams said. 'He was a dedicated civil servant who loved his job.' Speaking of Wagenhoffer's behavior after the collapse, Gillison said that 'everybody knew he had taken it hard,' but the 16-year department veteran continued working without even taking a leave of absence.

A mother and her 10-year-old daughter returned home Tuesday after surviving a 250-foot crash into a Tennessee ravine earlier this month. Rebecca Likens, 29, was driving her two daughters, 9 and 10, and an 18-month-old granddaughter along State Highway 10 in Macon County when she went over the guardrail to avoid hitting another car who veered into her lane. Though the car plummeted 250 to 300 feet into a creek, Likens and the children sustained only non-life-threatening injuries, according to the Macon County Times. 'All I could think about was getting of its way 'cause if I hit it head-on, it would have killed me and my kids,' Likens told WSMV. Saved: Rebecca Likens, bottom middle, survived a 250-foot crash into a ravine along with her two children and granddaughter . Survivors: Rebecca Likens' 10-year-old daughter and 1-year-old granddaughter, seen here in the hospital, survived the crash . Wreckage: When Rebecca Likens first saw her car after crashing it down a 250-foot ravine, she said God was with her because otherwise 'I don't think anybody would have survived' When she saw the oncoming car, Likens pulled right and dropped slightly off the road. She then turned left, over correcting, causing her to 'slingshot' across the highway and into the ravine. Immediately after the June 4 crash, Likens could only think of her children. 'I got them out of the car immediately,' she said. 'I was really concerned that the car would explode' Likens called her brother-in-law, who called police. At first, emergency personnel and Likens' family couldn't find the wreckage in the ravine's tree cover. First responders were finally able to help when they heard the family's screams for help. 'Then we kept looking for her and couldn’t find her. When I started driving back up the hill, I went with my windows down, because me and the ambulance had gone all the way to the bottom of the [Hwy 10] hill and couldn’t see anything,' Tennessee Highway Patrol Trooper Danny Fisher told the Times. 'Then I came back up with my windows down, and I could hear them screaming.' Strong: Rebecca Likens' 10-year-old daughter broke an arm and a leg after the ravine crash . Likens' husband, Donald Likens, arrived with his son around the same time as highway patrol. 'We were driving through here with my door open hollering for them,' Likens' husband told WSMV. 'I finally heard them screaming from the bottom of the ravine.' Likens' husband and son scaled the guardrail to get down the ravine after their family. 'I went down there as fast as I could,' Likens' husband said. A dozen emergency personnel followed them down. 'They carried the two youngest children up in their arms, and then they had to use a rope and basket system for the oldest child and the mother, due to their injuries,' Fisher told the Times. Likens was treated for a possible spinal injury from the crash. Her 10-year-old daughter had a broken arm and leg, as well as a blood clot in her lung, according to a Facebook post by her father. Likens also had three broken ribs and a separated shoulder, according to her Facebook. They returned home Tuesday. The two youngest children were treated with minor injuries. Likens said she always makes her children wear seat belts. She tells WSMV that's probably what save their lives. 'Lucky...the kids were strapped in, if they hadn’t been they would have been flying all over the place; that’s what kept them in the vehicle till it reached the bottom,' Lafayette Constable Tom Dallas told the Times. Totaled: The front of Rebecca Likens' car after she crashed it into a ravine to avoid a head-on collision . Shattered: Rebecca Likens said her children and granddaughter would have probably died in the crash if they weren't wearing their seat belts . In Facebook posts since the crash, Likens thanked God, as well as friends and family. 'I just want to tell everyone ty for there prays still keep praying for my daughter and the ones who was there getting us out of the bluff and I also want to thank my church family for being there at the hospital thank you,' she wrote. Likens' husband also went online to post his gratitude. 'i would like to thank the lord for watching over my family they made it thu the wreak and are home doing better,' he wrote in one Facebook post. 'THANK YOU JESUS.' 'i would like to thank all the people that helped at the wreck and thanks to ever one for all calls most of all for all the prayers thanks,' Donald Likens wrote in another post.

These are the shocking images which further detail Michael Jackson's tragic spiral into prescription pill dependency, revealed as his family pursue a lawsuit against his concert promoters. The evidence pictures, released by the Los Angeles Police Department this week, show numerous pill bottles, oxygen tanks and medical supplies littered around the superstar's bedroom at the time of his death on June 25, 2009. One image, which was not among the dozens of pictures shown as part of the Conrad Murray manslaughter trial, reveals a metal stand  with a hanging bag of intravenous fluids attached. In the background are numerous portraits of unidentified babies along with a small picture of Charlie Chaplin. Several canisters of what appears to be oxygen stand next to a wooden dresser topped with gilded mirror. Unseen: New evidence pictures of Jackson's bedroom were released this week including this shot of an IV bag, oxygen canisters and a bizarre series of baby portraits . Stash: A medical bag, believed to be Dr Conrad Murray's is tucked away in Jackson's grand closet . Emptied: Several empty pill bottles could be seen rolling around the floor of Jackson's opulent room . Michael Jackson's mother Katherine is suing AEG Live, . claiming it failed to properly investigate her son's personal doctor . Conrad Murray and missed warning signs about his failing health. Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in 2011 after giving Jackson a lethal dose of the anesthetic propofol. In the new photo collection, prescription pill bottles are seen lined up on a nightstand alongside over-the-counter products and a bottle of water while empty containers roll around on the floor. Along with propofol, the names of drugs Diazepam and Lidocaine are marked on some bottles' labels. In one telling image, which appears to have been taken in a car, there is a list of nearby 24-hour pharmacies and the phone numbers. Conrad Murray's medical bag is also indicated in one picture, according to RadarOnline, stashed high in a closet in the superstar's dressing room. There are also similar images from Murray's trial including shots of Jackson's iconic embroidered jackets hanging in a closet and stacks of movies on a nightstand. Close at hand: A list of the nearby pharmacies was discovered on what appears to be a car seat . Tragic demise: The new round of photographs from the bedroom of Michael Jackson after he died in 2009 were submitted into evidence at his wrongful death trial this week . The shocking new set of images came . as jurors in the Jackson case were shown an email on Monday in which the . top executive at AEG Live LLC expressed grave concerns about treatments . Jackson was receiving from his longtime dermatologist. The email sent by AEG Live CEO Randy Phillips said the company was 'scared to death' of drug injections given to Jackson. Phillips told jurors that the email . was a response to a $48,000 bill that Jackson's manager received for the . treatments by Dr Arnold Klein. 'He scares us to death because he is shooting him up with something,' Phillips wrote. Medicated: Jackson's bedroom was an array of prescription pill bottles and over-the-counter drugs at the time of his death in June 2009 . Dependency: Four bottles of Propofol and a variety of other drugs line Jackson's night stand . The end: Michael Jackson died of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication after suffering a cardiac arrest at his home in LA in 2009 . Heavy dosage: A medical bag full of bottles that was found in the medical superstar's bedroom . The email was sent to Jackson's business manager Michael Kane after a meeting was held at the singer's house to address his health and missed rehearsals. The treatments included numerous shots of cosmetic drugs such as Restalyne and botox, as well as other unidentified intramuscular shots, Phillips said, citing the bill. Klein's attorney has defended the doctor's treatment of Jackson. AEG denies any wrongdoing, and Phillips and other executives have testified during the trial that it would have been inappropriate to ask about or intervene in Jackson's medical care. Phillips was told by a judge to answer questions posed by a lawyer for Katherine Jackson without arguing and that his demeanor might be hurting his case. Immense talent: Michael Jackson speaks at a news conference in London on March 2009 ahead of his scheduled shows for AEG. He would never perform and died three months later . Waste: Various empty bottles and medical supplies were found in the room following the singer's death almost four years ago . Investigation: Police quickly arrived on the scene at Jackson's mansion following his tragic death in 2009 . Jurors were sent from the courtroom before Superior Court Judge Yvette Palazuelos addressed Phillips, who has sparred with attorney Brian Panish throughout his testimony. The lawyers have been repeatedly warned by the judge about the behavior. 'Arguing with the lawyers isn't really going to help,' Palazuelos told Phillips. 'It's not going to help your case. It's not going to help anybody.' Phillips said Panish was repeatedly asking him questions about the same subject. 'I'm just trying not to say the wrong thing,' Phillips said. The admonition by the judge came after Panish asked Phillips about characterizations of Murray that Phillips made in an email sent five days before the singer died. Overdose: The singer died at home, aged 50, from Propofol intoxication . Concoction: Jackson had been taking a variety of prescription pills and remedies at the time of his death . Phillips acknowledged that some of the statements - including that AEG Live had checked out Murray and that the former cardiologist didn't need the job - turned out not to be true. When Panish asked if Phillips had acknowledged that some of his statements to the director of Jackson's This Is It shows weren't true, the executive said: 'Honestly, only to stop you from badgering me, yes.' Palazuelos briefly stopped the testimony and issued the warning. Jessica Stebbins Bina, a defense attorney for AEG Live, said some of Panish's questions had been argumentative. The judge disagreed.

Scroll down for video . Swagger: if you're trying to blend in with shoppers at high-end jewelery stores, it's best to dress the part . The suspect then examined the two necklaces after the clerk put them on top of the counter so he could get a better look. The thief is then seen casually leaning on the counter as he continues to examine the pricey lavaliers - and that's when the clerk made a costly mistake. As the crook is looking at the two necklaces, he turns his back and briefly walks away - and that's when the thief took off with nearly $100,000 in diamonds. The grab: the suspect waits for the clerk to turn his back before taking off with the necklaces . This is just the latest in a string of high-end jewelery thefts in Manhattan this year. According to a New York Post report, on May 1, a couple managed to lift a $177,000 watch from the Porsche Design store.

The brothers of the Cleveland kidnapping suspect Ariel Castro appear distraught and angry in a newly released police video from the day that they were booked into jail along with their brother. The video, obtained by WKYC.com, shows Onil Castro, 50, waving his hands and appearing to shout at his brother as they were booked. At one point, he smacks his head into a glass window several times. Onil and brother Pedro Castro were later released from jail. The video was taken several hours after Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight were found alive in Ariel Castro's home on Seymour Avenue in Cleveland. They had been held captive for a decade in Ariel Castro's home on Seymour Avenue in Cleveland.

The brothers spoke of how they had no idea why they were . being arrested. They also revealed that prior to the arrests, they had . seen the daughter that Ariel fathered with Amanda Berry during her . captivity. On two different . occasions they saw Ariel bring the young girl to fast food restaurants- . one time at McDonald's and another at Burger King. Each time, he said . that the girl was his girlfriend's daughter. Onil Castro was in . the car with his brother Ariel when police pulled them over in a . McDonalds parking lot and his first thought was that Ariel had run a red . light. Pedro Castro was woken up at his home by police, and he thought . that they were arresting him for an outstanding open container warrant. They . were both far off base, as they only learned when they arrived at the . police station and were questioned separately about the three young . women that Ariel had secretly kept in his house. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Onil Castro, pictured center, and Pedro Castro, right, sat down with CNN's Martin Savidge, left, in their first interview since they were accused of being involved in the Cleveland kidnappings case . Released: The brothers were accused of being involved in the abductions, but have since been released after authorities concluded they had nothing to do with it . WATCH MORE AT CNN.COM. Pedro said that once at the station, he asked what he was being charged with and a police officer wrote the word 'kidnapping' down on a piece of paper and handed it to him. 'I didn't have my reading glasses, I looked and I said, ""Oh, open containers."" She said 2No, read it again."" And I said ""Oh!  Kidnapping!  What's this?  Kidnapping? I'm thinking kidnapping. Who did I kidnap?""' he told CNN. Pedro was similarly confused, and the only one to have a clue of what was going on was Ariel, who remains behind bars after his bail was set at $8million. 'He goes ""Onil, I'm sorry. You didn't know nothing about this, Onil. I'm sorry, Onil."" And that was it. And then that's when I broke down on my way over there. I said, ""What did my brother do? What did he do?""' Onil told CNN. Set up: Onil Castro (seen at his arrest at left and during the interview at right) was with his brother Ariel when police pulled them over in a McDonalds parking lot, and he said that maybe Ariel wanted to be caught . 'When he walked past me, he goes, ""Onil, you're never going to see me again. I love you bro."" And that was it. And he put his fist up for a bump.' They consider their brother to be a 'monster' and said that one of the worst moments for them came when they realized that Gina DeJesus was one of the kidnapping victims since they are friends with her father, Felix. 'I knew him for a long time and when I found out that Arial had Gina, I  just broke down its just shocking. Ariel, we know this guy for a long time and you got his daughter and you go round like nothing, you even went to the vigils, you had posters, you give his mama  a hug and you got his daughters captive?' Pedro said in disbelief in the interview that aired Monday morning. Pedro told of how one time he saw Ariel bring a young girl to the local McDonalds- the girl that is now known to be Jocelyn who the 52-year-old fathered with his kidnapping victim Amanda Berry. 'I seen Ariel with a little girl at McDonald's and I asked him who's that and he said ""This is a girlfriend's of mine,""' Pedro Castro told CNN. In the dark: Pedro Castro described how on the few occasions they went to their brother Ariel's house, he would keep them in the kitchen or outside on the steps . When he saw the . same young girl at Burger King with Ariel on a different occasion, he . asked where the mother was but Ariel just said she was busy. The brothers said . that they had no inkling about the years of abuse that went on at their . brother's house because they never had a thorough tour of his home on . Seymour Avenue. On . the rare occasions that they did visit his home, they stayed in the . kitchen and could not see into the other areas because Ariel had put up . curtains blocking the other rooms. He explained that it was a energy . saving technique. 'The . reason why we would go in the kitchen, because he had alcohol. And he . would take me in the kitchen, give me a shot,' Pedro said. Signs: In a photograph taken in 2001, suspect Ariel Castro stands with a former girlfriend in front of a padlocked door, which led to the basement, at his home on Seymore Avenue, Cleveland . 'House of horrors': Anthony Castro and his father stand in front of the door to the basement in 2001 . Other ways that he would keep his guests from suspecting any criminal activity was to constantly have a radio or TV on so that it would drown out any background noise, and they would never spend much time actually indoors, opting to eat out on the steps instead. The brothers, who were arrested along with Ariel Castro but later released due to a lack of evidence, say that since their release from prison, they have been faced with online death threats, a break-in at one of their homes, and vandalism. Busted: Ariel Castro is facing kidnapping and rape charges, and his brothers say they would have turned him in sooner had they known . When asked by CNN reporter Martin Savidge if the public would always suspect they had a role in the kidnappings, they answered 'yes' in unison. Onil Castro said: 'The people out there who know me, they know that Onil Castro is not that person, has nothing to do with that - would never even think of something like that. I was a very liked person [before the arrest], never had any enemies. '[There is] no . reason for anybody to think that I would ever do something like that. It . was a shock to all my friends. They couldn’t believe it.' Pedro Castro . added: 'I couldn’t never think of doing anything like that. If I knew . that my brother was doing this, in a minute I would have called the . cops; cause that ain’t right. But yeah, it’s going to haunt me down. Cause people are going to think Pedro had something to do with this and . pedro don’t have anything to  do this. They said that even though Castro is their brother, they would have had no choice but to turn him in - had they known. 'If I knew, I would have reported it, brother or no brother.' The brothers spoke amid new revelations of odd behavior at the Castro house in the days prior to the women's escape. Mark Sanchez, who lives in the neighborhood and shares Castro's affinity for the bass guitar, told The Daily Telegraph that he was at Castro's home on May 2 when he heard weird thudding sounds coming from the floor above. Mr Sanchez also saw a little girl at one point whom he claimed he had never seen before. Castro explained that the child was his granddaughter. Free: A neighbor got a picture of Amanda Berry as she escaped the home last Monday with her six-year-old daughter, who the kidnapper's brothers previously saw with Ariel on trips to McDonalds . Freed: Amanda Berry (center), Gina DeJesus . (left) and Michelle Knight (right) were held captive for ten years after . being abducting from the street between 2002 and 2004 . Escape route: The women escaped through the front door of Castro's home after a neighbor helped them . Days later, he was horrified to learn about what had been going on in the house for more than a decade. Mr Sanchez told the paper that he would always have to arrange plans to hang out with Castro in advance - because he never answered the door if he showed up without letting Castro know first. He told the Telegraph: 'I have to say the guy was a demon but he played it real cool. It was the first time that I heard any noise.' Ariel Castro is suspected of holding the women captive in his home for a decade. Authorities say he kidnapped all three women - Michelle Knight, Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus, raped them and fathered a child with one. The women were found May 6 after one escaped and called 911.

One is reported dead and 73 confirmed injured after an explosion at a Louisiana chemical plant started a massive blaze. Louisiana State Police say there was an explosion at a plant in the town of Geismar and footage showed thick, black smoke pouring from a huge fire at the facility. The fire broke out Thursday morning around 8:30am at the Williams Olefins plant about 20 miles from Louisiana capital Baton Rouge. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Explosion: A fire started by an explosion broke out at a Louisiana chemical plant Thursday morning and injured 64, some critically. One was reported dead . Louisiana's health department said 73 people were treated at hospitals for injuries ranging from minor to critical following the explosion. The cause is not yet known, but witnesses told WVLA that a fireball rose 300 feet into the air and the ground shook at neighboring plants. In a press conference, State police Capt. Doug Cain confirmed one victim was pulled from the facility dead. Several burn victims were treated at the scene and at a triage unit set up at nearby Iberville High School. The company said the blast happened at 8:37 a.m. at the plant in an industrial area of Geismar, a Mississippi River community about 20 miles southeast of Baton Rouge. By 10:30am, police had blocked off area surface roads and highways. Victims: Officials said at least injured at the petrochemical plant explosion at 8:30 Thursday morning. The fire was out by 11am . Cain said all of the plant's more than 300 workers had been accounted for by Thursday afternoon. At a roadblock several miles away from . the plant, where family members waited anxiously to hear about loved . ones, flames were easily visible above the trees. The fire is now fully contained, though fire can still be seen rising from the plant's tall smokestacks, which WVLA described as a 'slow burn' of remaining chemicals. Remnants: Smoke poured from the Williams Olefins plant after the initial fire was contained in what was called a 'controlled burn.' 'The chemicals are burning off,' J.B. Slaton, Louisiana State Police, said. 'They’re not leaving a compound, they’re not going into the air, they’re burning off.' Early tests did not indicate . dangerous levels of any chemicals around the plant, according to DEQ . spokesperson Jean Kelly, who called the blaze an 'ethylene fire.' However, a hazmat team was reportedly . on the scene to decontaminate the area and nearby residents were told . to remain indoors with doors and windows closed. A contract worker, Daniel Cuthbertson, 34, described a scene of ""mass hysteria"" immediately after the explosion, with workers scrambling over gates to get out of the plant. 'God was with me today because I know when I looked back, I barely made it. I know somebody was hurt.

He drove to a nearby gas station and saw flames 100 to 200 feet high. 'It was scary,' he said. Workers at the nearby plants were told to shelter in place after the blast, an order that was later lifted. The company's website says the plant puts out about 1.3 billion pounds of ethylene and 90 million pounds of polymer grade propylene a year. The plant makes highly flammable gases that are basic building blocks in the petrochemical industry.","The blast at a Geismar, Louisiana petrochemical plant ignited a massive blaze .

A pet-obsessed mother and  daughter have been banned from  keeping animals for a decade after 87 cats were discovered in their three-bedroom semi. Stunned RSPCA inspectors found an ‘unbearable’ scene of animal cruelty after being tipped off by neighbours about a foul smell coming from the house. Inspectors said cats were crammed in almost every corner of the house, including the loft. Scroll down for video . Unbearable scene: inspectors described the scene of the home 87 cats as unbearable after neighbours complained about the smell . Most of the cats discovered by RSPCA inspectors in the house were sick and underweight. Here some of their food bowls can be seen lined up on a kitchen work surface . Margaret and Kara Foster were both ordered to pay £500 while Kara was told to carry out community service . Following the RSPCA search, 13 of the cats had to put down to end their suffering. Margaret Foster, 65, and her daughter . Kara, 20, were also handed suspended prison sentences after they pleaded . guilty to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to animals and . admitted 13 charges of failing to ensure their welfare. Kevin McCole, prosecuting for the . RSPCA, told Leicester magistrates: ‘Most of the cats were extremely . thin, many had severe problems with their eyes caused by fighting and . infections and some had to have their eyes removed as a result. Two of the cats lie amid piles of rubbish after being discovered in the three-bedroom house . The home in Leicester was described by RSPCA inspectors as 'unbearable' Inspectors found litter-trays overflowing, and general filth throughout the house . ‘All were in need of urgent veterinary treatment. ‘Sadly, 13 were in such a poor state . of health they had to be put to sleep to end their suffering. The others . were nursed back to health and rehomed.’ RSPCA inspector Sally Kearns . told the court: ‘It was absolutely unbearable to see. The cats had not . been neutered and the situation had spiralled out of control, with lots . of breeding. ‘There were far too many cats for anyone to care for properly. ‘There were cats everywhere I looked – . in corners, behind furniture and even in the ceiling. Most were in a . pitiful state, extremely thin and with lots of eye problems.’ The court heard the RSPCA visited the . Fosters in February and March last year but were not allowed full . access. Inspectors were told there were six to nine cats and the house . was cleaned daily. But six months later police went to the house on an . unrelated matter and alerted the RSPCA to the true scale of the problem. A cat sits on top of a cupboard in the house where some of the pets were taking refuge in the attic . Thirteen of the cats were so ill as a result of the neglect they suffered that they had to be put down . The large number of cats is a result of breeding that got out of control and the Fosters' inability to pay for vets' bills . Rebecca Plant, defending the Fosters, . said being prosecuted was a ‘relief’ for the pair, who spent £200 a week . from their benefits on cat food. She said that they tried to get as . many of the animals neutered as they could but had run up debts in their . own names and then used other names at vets to avoid fees they could . not afford. Miss Plant added: ‘The house was cleaned from top to bottom daily.’ She said the cats were kept inside all . the time and the Fosters led ‘a reclusive existence’ because they . feared they would lose their home if the situation became known.

A Pennsylvania couple have avoided jail time after pleading guilty to charges in Indiana for driving cross country with five of their children inside a rented moving truck's unheated cargo area. A Henry County judge on Tuesday sentenced David Detjen, 41, and his 40-year-old wife, Rebecca, of Fairmont City, Pennsylvania, each to 18 months of probation after accepting their guilty pleas to felony child neglect. The Detjens were arrested last November at an Interstate 70 truck stop near New Castle as they were driving to California in search of work and a new life. Parents: Rebecca Detjen, left, and her husband, David, right, were charged with child neglect after police say the two put five of their seven children in the back of a moving truck en route from Pennsylvania to California . Outcome: David Detjen (center) and his wife, Rebecca (right), were each sentenced to 18 months of probation after pleading guilty to felony child neglect . Mother speaks: When asked by a reporter whether she thought their sentence was fair, Mrs Detjen answered that she did not know . Police said their children ranging in . age from 9 to 18 were in the freezing cargo area with 18 caged cats. Temperatures were in the 30s and police say the back of the truck . smelled of urine and gasoline. The Detjens pleaded guilty in May to felony neglect of a dependent carrying an 18-month prison sentence. Judge Mary Willis said during . Tuesday's hearing that she was aware of the parents' criminal record, . including a 2005 child endangerment conviction for both parents and a . 1990 child molestation conviction for the father, who was also found . guilty of retail theft in 2001, the Muncie Star Press reported. Under the plea deal, the couple received suspended 18-month jail sentences, minus four days served in an Indiana county jail. 'The facts and circumstances of this case were troubling,' the judge said in court. 'Poor decisions were made.' However, since their arrest last . November, Willis said that the Detjens have cooperated with child . services both in Indiana and Pennsylvania, and have made strides to . improve their parenting skills. The couple's case drew national . attention, with the Detjens receiving offers of financial assistance from . sympathetic strangers. A Texas resident even paid $20,000 to bond out . the couple. Outside the courtroom, the Detjens declined to comment on the outcome of the case. When asked by an RTV6 reporter if she considered their sentence to be fair, Mrs Detjen replied: 'I don't know. I'm not even from here.' Transport: Five of the couple's seven children and 15 . cats were riding inside the unheated cargo area of the 24-foot Budget . moving truck which before it was stopped by police in Indiana . Mess on wheels: The back of the truck was piled with the family's belongings, boxes, sleeping bags, appliances and a gas can . The Pennsylvania couple were arrested . November 28, 2012, in Indiana after a trooper found five of their seven . children riding in the back of a Budget moving truck along with the . family’s 15 cats en route to California more than 2,000 away. Sgt. John Bowling said the Detjens were traveling to San Bernardino, where the unemployed husband had a job prospect. The couple were jailed on child neglect charges after their arrest at an eastern Indiana truck stop. Bowling said Detjen told officers he knew putting his kids and pets in the unheated back of the truck ‘was kind of a stupid idea, but it was sort of a last resort.’ Acting on a tip from the family's relative, State Trooper Nick Razor stopped the 24-foot Budget on Interstate 70 at around 10pm. Inside the cab, the Detjens were seating beside two of their children aged 14 and 15 years old. When the officer went to the back of the vehicle and pulled the roll-up door, he discovered inside the couple's 18-year-old daughter and her four siblings ranging in age from nine to 17. Two of the kids were seated on top of boxes stacked high in the cargo area. Happier times: The couple, pictured far left with their large family, lived in Fairmount City, Pennsylvania, before the husband lost his job . Last-ditch effort: The family were en route to San Bernardino, Californoia, more than 2,000 miles away where David Detjan, center back, had a job prospect . The children, dressed in heavy clothing against the bone-chilling 20-degree weather, were traveling inside the unheated cargo area crammed with the family's belongings, boxes, sleeping bags, appliances, a filled gas can and 15 caged cats, The Smoking Gun reported. Police found two cell phones in the back, leading to believe that the children used the devices to communicate with their parents in the cabin. By the time they were stopped, the Detjens were on the road for about seven hours, driving nearly 400 miles. Following the couple's arrest, the children were placed in the custody of Child Protective Services, while the pets were handed over to Henry County Animal Control. Bad idea: Mr Detjan told police that placing his children in the freezing cargo area was 'stupid,' but he had no choice . ‘They were down on their luck for sure,’ Bowling told the Indianapolis Star. ‘They didn’t have a car. This was a last-ditch effort to follow up on a possible job in San Bernardino. But it still was an unwise decision.’ The Detjens' children have since been reunited with their parents.","David and Rebecca Detjen received 18-month suspended sentences after pleading guilty to felony child neglect .

Britain's fine weather looks set to be over for the foreseeable future as forecasters warn the unsettled and wet conditions could last until the end of July and into August. The last two weeks of hot, clear days have been replaced by erratic conditions, including rain and high winds of up to 40mph, interspersed with pockets of warm, sunny and dry periods. Forecasters have attributed the unpredictable stretch - which is being caused by a south shifting jet stream - to just another 'typical British summer'. The Great Marquess steam locomotive cuts her way across gloomy skies on her maiden 'Fellsman' voyage of the year over Ribblehead Viaduct in North Yorkshire. It comes as forecasters warn the unsettled and wet conditions could last until the end of July and into August . It is one of the most scenic railway routes in Britain, the Settle to Carlisle line. But passengers would have been able to see little of their beautiful surroundings thanks to the 'typically British' summer we have been experiencing - caused by a south shifting jet stream . Jet streams are belts of fast flowing, narrow air currents found in the atmosphere, formed near air masses with significantly different temperatures . The 'blink and you'd miss it summer' is . the latest in six months of unsettled weather, including a particularly . bitter winter, and unseasonably cold Spring - which saw the coldest .

UK, and tends to be further south in the winter and further north in the . summer. But it has been sitting further south than is normal for this time of year, which is why the UK looks set to experience a wet summer. BBC weather forecaster Paul Hudson wrote on his blog about the work of Professor Hubert Lamb, who noted a yearly change of pattern from around the middle of June. He called it the ‘return of the westerlies’; and means a 'typical British Summer' sees unsettled weather last well into July and August. He wrote: 'Lamb’s work effectively describes a typical British summer; one in which long spells of fine settled weather are the exception rather than the rule.

'Although it’s early days, there are already indications that this summer is starting to resemble one of Professor Lamb’s typical British summers.' A Met Office spokesman said what we were experiencing was indeed a 'typical British summer'. He said: 'The weather can be best summed up over the course of the day as quite unsettled, a few places experiencing dry, bright spells, and temperatures will be quite decent when the sun does come out - with highs of around 22 degrees. 'There is rain clearing out of Scotland, heading into the South West moving along the south coast into the afternoon - turning into heavy rain throughout the evening. 'There will also be more rain overnight in places and it will windy as well along the western coast, with gusts of between 35-40mph.

A . band of high pressure is blocking the path of the jet stream, meaning . that the present weather conditions will stay until this pressure moves. 'The jet stream is a narrow band of fast moving wind high up in the atmosphere, which effectively can steer in low pressure systems off the Atlantic which then get caught up in this area . 'Where that jet stream sits is important. If it is to the north, we get settled conditions. 'To the south we get unsettled conditions sent to us. 'At the moment it is sitting more or less over us or just to the south. 'We will see some bright spells in between, where it is sunny with some pretty decent temperatures, but the weather is moving through quite quickly.

The judge asked Mr Counelis about a remark posted to the Coffee Party Progressives Facebook page in March, according to the Daily News.

He replied: 'No. Best to avoid, at times,' and said he had not formed an opinion on the case. The Coffee Party Progressives Facebook page showed a person matching the potential juror's identity had written an inflammatory comment in response to a posting about the case. After declaring that justice was coming, the Facebook comment alleged a conspiracy involving Zimmerman and local police. 'With the noise we made…it couldn't be covered up,' the commenter said.

A strike by militant French air traffic controllers has left thousands of British tourists and business travellers stranded across Europe. Most major French cities were affected and the knock-on effect is likely to continue into today. Hundreds of services to and from British airports heading for destinations such as Paris, Lyon, Nice,  Toulouse and Marseilles were cancelled yesterday. Nice airport is one of those affected by the air traffic controller's strike that has left thousands of Brits stranded . Flights that cross French airspace were also cancelled or delayed, including holiday destinations in Spain and Portugal. In another black day for the country’s . socialist government, many air traffic controllers stayed at home for . the second day prompting French aviation bosses to order all airlines . using French airports to cancel 50 per cent of their services. Last night Greek air traffic . controllers were reported by airlines to be calling a ‘siesta strike’ – . from noon to 2pm today – which will disrupt and delay some flights. Controllers in both countries are protesting against a planned overhaul . of aviation by the European Commission to create what has been nicknamed . ‘a single European sky’. They fear this plan to centralise air traffic . control across the EU will lead to job losses. Low cost carrier easyJet was yesterday forced to cancel 200 flights – of which 92 were to or from the UK – because of the chaos. Ryanair said around 400 of its flights . had been cancelled across Europe, including many to and from Britain. British Airways cancelled 24 UK flights. All said they hoped to run a . ‘near normal’ service today. The militancy is due to spread to . French railways. French rail unions threatened to cancel up to 70 per . cent of services in protest at reform of their working practices. Easyjet has had to cancel 128 flights due to the industrial action, forcing thousands to make other plans . These include high speed TGV services, with the stoppages due to start last night and to continue into tomorrow. But Eurostar services from London to . Paris are not expected to be affected. Passengers reported a mixed bag . of help from airlines. EasyJet said it had booked 1,800 hotel rooms for . stranded passengers before the strike. But Ryanair customers who contacted . the Daily Mail spoke of ‘shocking customer service’ and a ‘couldn’t care . less’ attitude’ and said they had paid out hundreds of pounds for their . own hotel rooms.

The origins of the iconic royal yacht Britannia have been laid bare after the release of the original sketches for the design of the ship's interior. 60 years after her launch, drawings of Britannia's state rooms by architect Sir Hugh Casson have been handed over to a trust by his daughter. The renowned designer was appointed by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, who welcomed the opportunity to put their own stamp on the yacht to mark the beginning of a new era. Designs: These sketches by Sir Hugh Casson depict the original plans for the royal yacht Britannia; this is the Queen's personal study on board the vessel . Collection: The architect's daughter has given the drawings, such as this one which also shows the Queen's study, to the Royal Yacht Britannia Trust . Unchanged: As this photograph of the Queen's study shows, the designs remain largely intact . Britannia was launched in 1953, two months before Her Majesty's coronation, and clocked up more than one million miles until she was decommissioned in 1997. Sir Hugh was commissioned to put forward ideas after the royal couple rejected the designs put forward by the yacht’s builders. They wanted the ship to be a 'home from home' whose contemporary style would be a contrast to their ornate palaces. Among the rooms kitted out by Sir Hugh were the Queen's study, the sun room and the grand staircase - and the designs have remained unchanced for six decades since. He had been selected for the job after impressing the Duke of Edinburgh in his role as the director of architecture at the Festival of Britain in 1948. Relaxed: Rooms like the main drawing room were meant to be much more laid-back than the royal palaces . Classic design: Sir Hugh's vision for the main drawing room and other areas of the ship were forward-thinking . Intimate: This drawing shows the design for Prince Philip's bedroom on board the royal yacht . Domestic: The Duke of Edinburgh's bedroom on Britannia, which was decommissioned in 1997 . His daughter, Carola Zogolovitch, has now presented the 10 photographic slides of the sketches to the Royal Yacht Britannia Trust for the first time. Mrs Zogolovitch said: 'When Britannia was commissioned the yacht’s builders had presented to the Queen their ideas for the interior of the yacht in the style of an Atlantic liner. 'The Duke, a Navy man, didn’t want that. He said he wanted something simple. 'My father had been director of architecture and really the impresario at the Festival of Britain. Because the Duke of Edinburgh was so interested in anything that was progressive and new he thought father would be the perfect person to consult. Sun room and bar: The royal couple were said to love spending time on board Britannia . Leisure space: The sun room and bar area as they appear now on the yacht, which is moored in the Firth of Forth . Office: Prince Philip's study, which he commissioned personally from Sir Hugh Casson . Room: The Duke of Edinburgh's study today, 16 years after Britannia left active service . 'Britannia was the first opportunity for the newly crowned Queen and her husband to make something of their own, to their own taste. 'Britannia wasn’t inherited - it was something they could put their own stamp on. It was a floating palace so it needed to be quite formal, but it was also very relaxed. 'The Queen and the Duke were were young at the time and they didn’t want Victorian interiors like at Buckingham Palace. They wanted something that wasn’t too elaborate. 'My father understood what they wanted, and the fact that the rooms have not been changed in 60 years is testament to his designs. 'They were contemporary designs that have stood the test of time. The yacht is like a time capsule.' Iconic: The grand staircase, which was designed by Sir Hugh in a contemporary 1950s style . Out of use: Britannia now stands decommissioned in Leith, on the Firth of Forth . Bob Downie, chief executive of the Royal Yacht Britannia, said: 'The sketches are a fantastic and fascinating piece of Britannia’s history. 'We are very grateful to have received them and to be able to show them off to our visitors.' Sir Hugh went on to form a close friendship with the Royal Family, designing interiors at Windsor Castle and Buckingham Palace. He also enjoyed several trips on Britannia as a guest of the Queen Mother. Britannia was launched at John Brown’s Shipyard in Clydebank on April 16, 1953, two months before the Queen’s coronation and the conquering of Mount Everest. On royal tours the 410ft yacht boasted a crew of 220 yachtsmen, 21 officers, three season officers and a 26-strong Royal Marine band. She was decommissioned in Portsmouth on December 11, 1997, after 44 years in service, an occasion which is said to have brought tears to the Queen's eyes. Britannia is now moored on the Firth of Forth, and can be visited from the town of Leith.","Sir Hugh Casson drew designs for interior rooms of royal yacht .

Executed: William Van Poyck, 58, of Florida, was pronounced dead at . 7.24pm, 23 minutes after the injection process began at the State Prison . Van Poyck declined a final meal and was visited on Wednesday by his sister, four friends and a spiritual adviser. Van Poyck's case garnered international attention because he published three books and maintained a blog while on death row. He even wrote recently about his pending execution. The family of the slain guard, Fred Griffis, has said in interviews that they were frustrated that news stories focused on Van Poyck, the crime and his writings - and not Griffis.

In 1999, Valdes was stomped to death in prison. Seven guards were charged with his death, but none were convicted. Following Valdes' death, Van Poyck was moved to Sussex State Prison in Virginia for his safety. That's where he wrote a 324-page autobiography, A Checkered Past: A Memoir, saying his purpose was not to elicit sympathy but 'to put a human face on me and convicts in general'. Van Poyck went on to write two novels. He won awards for his writing and kept a blog since 2005 by writing letters to his sister Lisa Van Poyck, who posted them online. 'He is deeply remorseful for the ending of Fred Griffis' life,' Lisa Van Poyck told The Associated Press on Tuesday. 'He is guilty of a crime of trying to break somebody out of a prison transport van - he had no intention of hurting anyone.'","William Van Poyck, 58, of Florida, was pronounced dead at 7.24 pm in Florida State Prison .

According to the Cecil Daily, court records do not directly describe Madden as the 'person of interest' but a passage in the charging document reads: 'A resident of that location, Richard Eugene Madden, Jr., was of the last known persons to see the victim.' Kami, who lived in Charlestown, Maryland, with her mother, stepfather and two younger siblings, was staying at her so-called grandparents' home for the weekend. No other family members were with her. Last night, her devastated stepfather called the little girl's death 'an inside job.' 'With all the information that I've gotten it has to be an inside job,' Ricky Dean told WBAL-TV.

Outraged fans took to Facebook this week after the Home & Garden Channel suggested using an American flag as a tablecloth for a Fourth of July party. As part of a slideshow on its website titled 'Simply Chic Fourth of July Entertaining Ideas', Ole Glory was pictured underneath plates of fruit and a bowl of lemonade. 'Drape a large American flag over the table as a bright and festive table runner. Use a nylon flag so spills can be easily wiped off and the flag can later be hung with pride on a flag pole,' the caption read, according to multiple posts on Facebook. 'Disrespectful': HGTV viewers were outraged after the channel suggested using an American flag as a tablecloth during Forth of July parties in a slideshow on their website . Apology: HGTV responded on Facebook to the dozens of post decrying their suggestion that the American flag could be used as a tablecloth during parties . 'Using an American flag as a table cloth dishonors all Americans who love . Old Glory — especially those who gave their lives defending it. No one . dies for a table cloth,' one post wrote on the channel's page. After dozens of posts decrying the suggestion, HGTV issued an apology on their Facebook page Wednesday afternoon and removed the image from the slideshow. 'HGTV Fans, regarding the recent article that appeared on our website...This was a regrettable use of our flag and it never should have happened,' the channel's apology read. 'We sincerely apologize and have removed the post from our website. We want to assure our fans that HGTV is proud of the American flag and everything it symbolizes for our people.' Before the apology was posted, Facebook users were enraged. 'Many heroes died protecting the USA flag. and you show that level of disrespect for it?!! . its NOT a decoration!! it should be shown respect and dignity, not a spill catcher,' one post read. Many noted they served in the military, lost someone in the military or have family and friends who are veterans or currently serving. Respect: One user tells HGTV the American flag is 'not a tablecloth' and demands the channel respect Ole Glory . Party: The suggestion was posted in a slideshow called 'Simply Chic Fourth of July Entertaining Ideas' that had other, less offensive, decorating suggestions like this traditional tablecloth . 'HGTV, boy did you mess up when you used the American flag as a tablecloth,' one HGTV reader posted. 'As the mother of a fallen soldier, I am offended that the American flag means so little to HGTV.' 'After recently seeing a flag draped over my husband's casket I can't imagine setting one out as a tablecloth,' another said. Many pointed out that the flag's use in the picture appeared to have violated U.S. Code, which says 'no disrespect should be shown to the flag of the United States of America'. U.S. Code also stipulates that the flag should never touch anything beneath it, like a table. 'The flag should never be fastened, displayed, used, or stored in such a manner as to permit it to be easily torn, soiled, or damaged in any way,' the code also stipulates. While there is no punishment for violating flag code, as a tablecloth for a party, it's likely a flag would be spilled on—which HGTV even noted in the original caption. Many on Facebook didn't appear satisfied by the apology. 'Until I see in the news that you have fired the people responsible for using the American flag as a tablecloth, I will not even consider tuning in to your channel,' wrote one commenter. '...So many people are so totally clueless how insulting, how disrespectful, and how unamerican this is.' Other users noted this Friday is Flag Day.","'Use a nylon flag so spills .

One in three of us is gambling with our health by eating food that is past its ‘use by’ date, food watchdogs warn today. Another one in three happily consume food that has dropped on the floor, while one in five admit they don’t wash their hands before preparing a meal. The Food Standards Agency, which came up with the findings, says the nation needs to clean up its kitchen habits to tackle a food poisoning epidemic that strikes down more than 1.7million a year. Danger: A third of people eat food that is past its 'use by' date despite tests showing food poisoning bacteria is found on two thirds of fresh chicken sold on the high street (FILE PHOTO) Most concern surrounds campylobacter, which infects as many as 460,000 Britons every year, leading to 100 deaths. Official research by the Food Standards Agency shows the bug can be found on as many as two thirds of all fresh chicken on sale on the high street. Other concerns are salmonella, E.coli and Listeria, which is a particular risk to pregnant women and babies in the womb. The FSA found that 85 per cent of people check the safety of food using the ‘sniff test’, while 68 per cent rely on checking the colour. However, the watchdog said neither of these offer a reliable guide to safety and urged the public to stick by the ‘use by’ date, which relates to safety and are based on scientific testing. More than 40 per cent of those questioned said they would eat food after its ‘use by’ date. Such is the concern about food poisoning that watchdogs in the UK and the EU are working on controversial plans to allow fresh meat to be sprayed with lactic acid to kill off harmful bugs. A survey by Which? found 60  per cent of shoppers would be ‘unlikely’ to buy chicken that had been sprayed or washed with the mild acid. The EU has already given approval for lactic acid to be used on beef carcasses and it is consulting on extending this to chicken and other meat. FSA food safety expert, Bob Martin, said: ‘By not washing their hands before preparing food at home, or ignoring ‘use by’ dates, people could be setting themselves and their friends or family up for a bout of really unpleasant illness.’ The watchdog has set up a Kitchen Check on its website to provide guidance on how to ensure food is safe.","A third of people would also eat food that has been on the floor .

A study claims that adults should make sure they get a daily dose of the vegetable oil that chips are often cooked in. The research revealed that basic cooking oil, popularly used for frying fish, cooking chips and roasting potatoes in millions of homes, is healthier than previously thought. Basic cooking oil, popularly used for frying fish, cooking chips and roasting potatoes, is healthier than previously thought as it contains omega-6 fatty acid, linoleic acid . It showed that everyone should be getting up to four tablespoons a day in order to protect their heart, U.S. researchers said, after conducting 15 clinical trials on 500 adults. Vegetable oil is, typically, made from plants like sunflower, corn or soy and used in both commercial, mass produced cooking and in the home. It is most commonly an alternative to animal-based fats and both cheaper and more practical for day to day cooking than expensive and trendy virgin olive oils, for instance. The new research by food scientists from the University of Missouri suggests a daily dose, similar to the current average, is actually good for the heart not bad for it. Vegetable oil, they say, contains an omega-6 fatty acid called linoleic acid (LA) which reduces blood cholesterol levels and lowers the risk of heart disease. The results of their clinical trials on humans found no evidence that LA ‘promotes inflammation’, contradicting a previous study that was conducted on animals, they said. The full paper, to be published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics is just the latest in the see-sawing of medical opinion about vegetable oil. Such oils used to be welcomed as an alternative to the kind of lard and animal fats which had previously been used to fry and roast food. Linoleic acid reduces cholesterol levels meaning that it decreases a person's risk of developing heart disease . The boom in junk food from the 1970s saw many health experts claim people were consuming too much oil in their diets as they tucked in to burgers, fries and pizzas. It has also helped fuel the rise in sales of alternative but expensive trendy oils from virgin olive to walnut. Lead researcher, nutritionist Professor Kevin Fritsche, said humans respond differently to vegetable oil, adding: ‘In the field of nutrition and health, animals aren’t people. ‘We’re not saying that you should just go out and consume vegetable oil freely. ‘However, our evidence does suggest that you can achieve a heart-healthy diet by using soybean, canola, corn and sunflower oils instead of animal-based fats when cooking.’ The clinical tests looked at the bodily reactions to adults consuming a variety of different fats, including vegetable oils. It found the type of inflammation that leads to heart disease was most likely to be a result of too much animal fat rather than vegetable oil, said the researchers. Professor Fritsche said: ‘Some previous studies have shown that inflammation, which is an immune response in the body, can occur when certain fats are consumed. ‘We’ve come to realise that this inflammation, which can occur anywhere in the body, can cause or promote chronic diseases. ‘We know that animal fats can encourage inflammation, but in this study, we’ve been able to rule out vegetable oil as a cause.’ He added: ‘Consumers are regularly bombarded with warnings about what foods they should avoid. ‘While limiting the overall fat intake is also part of the current nutrition recommendations, we hope people will feel comfortable cooking with vegetable oils.’","People should consume up to four tablespoons of vegetable oil a day .

A test used for heart disease is 'flawed' and may be leading to thousands of patients being given the wrong treatment, an expert has warned. Professor Nick Curzen said that x-rays for angina - a painful tightening of the chest - give inaccurate results in a quarter of all patients. The tests, called angiograms, involve patients being given a local anaesthetic while a long tube is inserted into their groin or arm up to the coronary artery in the heart. Flawed: According to Professor Curzen, angiograms are inaccurate in 26 per cent of cases . A dye is then passed through the tube while a series of x-rays are taken which show up any blockages in the arteries. Professor Curzen, a consultant cardiologist at Southampton General Hospital, said the x-rays do not give a precise reading on whether blood flow is restricted. He said angiograms should be used alongside another procedure which involves inserting a tiny wire into arteries which measure the blood pressure. Professor Curzen carried out a trial on 200 patients which showed that angiograms led to the wrong treatment in 26 per cent of cases. During the trial patients were given angiograms and doctors then decided on their treatment. They then underwent the second procedure, a fractional flow reserve test, and doctors were asked if they would change the treatment. In 26 per cent of cases they did. Faulty: The test is supposed to pick up arterial blockages such as the one above but doesn't always get it right . Professor Curzen said: 'The results indicate management of patients with stable angina by angiogram alone is probably flawed and treatment would be much more tailored to the individual through routine use of a FFR pressure test at the diagnostic stage.' He now wants to conduct a much larger trial in the hope it will lead to a 'major change' in the way tests are done. About one in seven men and one in 12 women over 65 suffer from angina although it is also common in patients in their fifties. It occurs when the arteries supplying blood to the heart become narrowed resulting in a heavy, tight pain that can spread to the arms and neck. Angina is a form of heart disease and patients may go on to suffer heart attacks and strokes if it is not properly treated. Patients are given a spray or pills to take once an attack starts and other drugs to help prevent them.","Angiograms are inaccurate 26% of the time says Professor Nick Curzen .

A toddler facing death after being ravaged by a flesh-eating bug was told by his heart- broken mother that he could ‘go’ if he wanted to. Lucy Dove gently whispered the words into 18-month-old Frankie Mould’s ear because she couldn’t bear to see him suffer any more. Her son had been through a nine-and-a-half hour operation to remove skin and tissue from his back and thigh, but doctors did not think he would survive the night and had told his parents to hope for a miracle. Although the odds were stacked against him, Frankie showed extraordinary resilience to battle back from the brink – and is now home from hospital after six weeks of treatment. ‘He is doing well at the moment and we are so happy that he is alive,’ said Miss Dove from Sunderland. ‘We weren’t religious, but we are now. When doctors haven’t got any hope what are you left with? We started praying to save him and our prayers were answered.’ Frankie is thought to have got the necrotising fasciitis bug from a graze to his forehead a few weeks earlier. Bacteria got into his body, lay dormant and then ran wild. At one point a nurse told Miss Dove, 25, and the boy’s father Wayne Mould, also 25, that he was ‘the sickest boy in the country’. Getting better all the time: Frankie was left in a coma after suffering from a horrific flesh-eating bug . Happy toddler: Frankie is recovering with help from his mother Lucy . Frankie was put in a drug-induced coma for 12 days to help his body fight for life. He had a second operation lasting five hours to remove more infected tissue and then had skin graft surgery to repair the terrible damage caused by the bug. Skin was taken from his legs and trunk and stretched across his back and damaged thigh. The terrifying bug was stopped just in time and the prompt treatment at Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary has been a success. Amazing recovery: Frankie was put in a drug-induced coma for 12 days to help his body fight for life . Shock: Frankie's illness was thought to have started from a graze to his forehead, where the bacteria got into his body . The family’s ordeal began on April 8 when Frankie developed flu-like symptoms and behaved ‘strangely’ as if he was in agony. His mother took him to the local casualty unit and noticed a lump on his back – the first outward sign of the bug that was attacking his tissue below the surface. Frankie was transferred to the RVI where he had the first marathon operation to cut out the infected areas and was then put into the intensive care unit. Marathon operation: Frankie had a five-hour procedure to have a skin graft over his infected leg and back . Miss Dove, a mother of two, said: ‘They were saying they needed a miracle and having to take it minute by minute. ‘Being a mum you have to put your children first, and I thought, “is it selfish of me to want him to get through this, because of the damage to his body?” We were told bad things all the time so I whispered in his ear, “Frankie, if you want to go, you go.” But he didn’t want to go and stayed stable throughout. He is so tough.’ Peter Hodgkinson, consultant plastic surgeon in charge of his treatment, said the skin grafts ‘were healing beautifully’. Full of energy: Frankie will continue to need treatment but his skin is healing quickly . The skin is swathed in bandages but Frankie is full of energy, although he will need treatment until he is grown. Miss Dove and Mr Mould, who works for a car dealership, are just grateful to the doctors. ‘The infection was spreading at a frightening rate,’ said Miss Dove. ‘I’m convinced their speedy action saved his life.’ There are 500 cases of necrotising fasciitis a year in the UK.","18-month-old Frankie Mould had to be put in a coma for 12 days .

A two-year-old boy from Wales is the only person in the world to be diagnosed with an illness so rare doctors do not even have a name for it. Alfie Jones, from Bridgend, Wales, baffled doctors when he was born due to his unprecedented number of different health problems, which include a hole in the heart, deafness and partial blindness. Doctors have simply called Alfie’s illness an ‘unbalanced chromosome rearrangement’ which has never before been diagnosed. Alfie is unlikely to ever learn to walk due to his dislocated hips and has not learned to talk, but his mother Marie, 37, says her son is ‘a little ray of sunshine.’ She said: ‘Despite everything that's wrong with Alfie, he is a very happy, content little man who is loved and adored by all who meet him. ‘We have got to the stage where we look beyond his condition and see him as just our son and I love him so much, . ‘We were having some problems as a family before Alfie came along but he made us stop and think about what is important. ‘He is the glue that holds our family together.’ Doctors confirmed no one anywhere in the world has been diagnosed with condition which affects chromosomes number 11 and 15. Marie and husband Ken, 43, say that medical experts have been unable to tell them how long Alfie will live for. Despite the uncertain future, the couple say they are the luckiest parents in the world to have a son like him – especially as he has just learned to smile. Marie, a mother-of-six said: ‘The first question we wanted to ask was how long is he going to live but nobody knows because there have been no previous cases. Multi-problematic: Alfie, with his parents Marie and Ken, is unlikely to ever learn to walk, is deaf and partially blind . ‘The doctors have told us he is unique, they've never seen anything like it before. We don't really know what to expect in the future.’ Marie and her husband are trying to raise £20,000 to pay for a sensory room and everyday equipment vital for Alfie's survival and happiness. Marie said: ‘If we get the funds together to put the right amounts of input in then we hope Alfie will live a long and happy life.’ Community paediatrician Dr Elaine English, based at Bridgend's Princess of Wales Hospital, said: ‘I have never seen the condition Alfie has and would not expect to again. ‘He is a really cheery chappie.

Dale Cregan, 30, who was told by a judge yesterday that he would spend the rest of his life in prison, was on bail when he gunned down two female police officers in an act of ‘pre-meditated savagery’. Just weeks after going on the run after killing two gangland rivals, high-living drug dealer Cregan lured WPCs Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes into a ‘calculated trap’ by reporting a burglary. Scroll down for videos . Paul Bone, the father of murdered WPC Fiona Bone, spoke of his fears that Dale Cregan, the man who murdered his daughter, will one day go free . Dale Cregan will spend the rest of his life in prison . And as they walked up the driveway, he emerged from the front door and mowed them both down in a hail of bullets. He then hurled his ‘calling card’ grenade at the dying officers and drove to the nearest police station to hand himself in. Last night the family of PC Bone, 32, said Cregan should be hanged. Her father, Paul Bone, said: ‘One of the problems is when they did away with hanging, in the 60s, we were told life would mean life, now it’s very flexible, or life is a very flexible sentence.’ The brutal slaying of the two officers took the number of policewomen killed in the line of duty to ten and also brought to an end one of the biggest manhunts in British history. Yesterday, as Cregan was told he will . spend the rest of his life behind bars, for the WPC murders and the . gangland killings of David Short, 46, and his son Mark, 23, it emerged . that: . Yesterday . Judge Timothy Holroyde  QC told him: ‘You pursued the officers with . cold-blooded and ruthless determination to end their lives. You acted . with pre-meditated savagery. You will never be released from prison.’ Dedication: PC Fiona Bone (left), 32, and PC Nicola Hughes (right), 23, were gunned down by Cregan . Home Secretary Theresa May said: ‘Cregan is a despicable individual. I am pleased he’s been sentenced to spend the rest of his life behind bars.’ Ian Hanson, of the Greater Manchester Police Federation, added: ‘Dale Cregan is an abomination upon our society and in my view he has forfeited the right to walk the streets for the rest of his life. 'I hope that he dies in prison many years from now a sad, lonely old man, having spent decades staring at a cell door, after which he can rot in hell for all eternity.‘ . The Chief Constable of Greater Manchester, Sir Peter Fahy, defended the decision to release Cregan on  bail following the first Short murder, saying the force had insufficient  evidence to charge him. Cregan’s killing spree began after a row in a pub between two rival crime families in Greater Manchester. In . May last year, the Short family were in the Cotton Tree pub in . Droylsden, Manchester. Last orders had been called when Cregan – wearing . a balaclava – entered the room and fired seven shots, hitting Mark . Short and three other men. Gareth Cleminson (left),  boyfriend of Nicola Hughes, and Sam Hughes, brother of Nicola Hughes, outside Preston Crown Court react outside Preston Crown Court where Dale Cregan was told he will die in prison . In August, David Short was at home when Cregan and accomplice Anthony Wilkinson turned up armed to the teeth. Firing at will they chased him through the house and out into the garden, hitting him numerous times before finally throwing a grenade. The couple who were held hostage in their own home by killer Cregan have spoken of their terror as he gunned down two policewomen outside their house. It was on Alan Whitwell and his partner Lisa McIntosh’s driveway that Cregan shot victims Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone. ‘I saw the gun in his hand, and he mumbled something about the police,’ Alan, 34, told The Sun. ‘I heard the front door open and then just head “Bam!” The shots seemed to go on forever.’ The barber from Hattersley, Greater Manchester, who had met Dale Cregan a few times through mutual friends, describes his horror when he saw Cregan pull the pin out of a grenade and throw it back towards the house, saying it was ‘like a scene from Terminator’. ‘There was blood everywhere, I wanted to be sick.’Cregan had turned up at the house the night before the brutal murders demanding a haircut from barber Alan. Mistaking him for a colleague, Alan let the killer inside after which Cregan threatened him with the grenade. The murders of Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone came after Alan, Lisa and her seven-year-old daughter had been held hostage for 12 hours. The grenade caused ‘devastating’ injuries to Mr Short’s torso and he died instantly. Cregan fled and a massive manhunt was launched. On September 18, police received a phone call reporting a burglary at a house in a quiet cul-de-sac in Hattersley, Greater Manchester. Using the name Adam Gartree, Cregan said a man had thrown a concrete slab through his window and run off. When the call handler told him someone would investigate the matter, he replied: ‘I’ll be waiting.’ WPCs Bone and Hughes, who were both unarmed, were sent to investigate the call, but as they approached the house the front door opened and they were confronted by Cregan. Protected by their body armour, neither officer was initially injured but they were soon mown down in the hail of 32 bullets. Just 31 seconds after arriving at the house, both officers lay dead or dying. After handing himself in, Cregan was asked whether he had any weapons on him. He replied: ‘I dropped the gun at the scene and I’ve murdered two police officers.’ Cregan had 17 previous convictions – many for violence – stretching back to 2000. He hardly saw his father, Paul, a tool setter, who left the family when Cregan was a boy and, ironically, set up home with police officer Deborah Tanswell. Not long after leaving Littlemoss High School in Droylsden, Cregan took to drug dealing and boasted of earning up to £20,000 a week. He drove a Mercedes Jeep and enjoyed business-class flights and holidays in the West Indies and the Far East. Of Cregan’s associates, Wilkinson, 34, was jailed for a minimum of 35 years; Luke Livesey, 28, Damian Gorman, 38, and Jermaine Ward, 24, to a minimum of 33 years; and Mohammed Imran Ali, 32, to seven years for assisting an offender.","Multiple murderer Dale Cregan was jailed for life yesterday .

RBS outgoing chief Stephen Hester was removed in a 'coup' staged by George Osborne . Royal Bank of Scotland’s new boss will be ordered to lend billions more to struggling businesses after George Osborne staged a ‘coup’ to remove its chief executive Stephen Hester. A day after Mr Hester’s departure was announced, the troubled banking giant was the biggest faller on the FTSE100, initially losing more than 6 per cent of its value in early trading. Shares rallied later but £650million was wiped off the value of the bank, which is 81 per cent owned by the taxpayer, following George Osborne’s political gamble. City concern was intensified by speculation the bank’s chairman, Sir Philip Hampton, could follow Mr Hester through the exit door next year. The Treasury denied Labour claims that Mr Hester had been removed to pave the way for a pre-election ‘fire sale’ of RBS, which received a £45billion taxpayer bailout. But ministers did make it clear the new regime at RBS would be expected to increase lending to Britain’s small businesses. Treasury minister Sajid Javid told MPs that small business lending would become ‘even more prominent in RBS’s strategy’. Last night David Cameron told the financial website Bloomberg that voters were more interested in getting their money back than a quick return to the private sector. ‘It will take time, because this is a bank that is still healing,’ the Prime Minister said. ‘As for when we get it back into the private sector, I just have two very simple concerns – one is we must make sure this bank contributes to the recovery of the UK economy. 'Secondly, people put their money in. I want them to get their money out.’ A total of £650million was wiped off the value of RBS after George Osborne's political gamble . Vince Cable (pictured with Osborne) launched an attack on RBS's lending record . What happens now to RBS? George Osborne believes it is time for RBS to move from the ‘rescue phase’ to the ‘next stage’. This means preparing the bank for a return to the private sector and making it lend more to business to boost the economy. The future for both RBS and Lloyds banking group will be made clear next week when the Chancellor gives his annual speech at Mansion House in London on the state of the economy. What are the privatisation options?One is to test the market in the near future by selling off a tranche of RBS shares to taxpayers – similar to the ‘Tell Sid’ privatisation of British Telecom in the 1980s. Another option is to divide RBS before privatisation. It would be split into a ‘good bank’, which would lend to businesses and households and a ‘bad bank’ which would contain all the toxic assets, and dispose of them separately. This proposal is supported by several members of the Banking Commission, including Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and former chancellor Lord Lawson. What does the Chancellor think?Mr Osborne has made it clear in the past that he is opposed to splitting the bank in two, as it would be expensive, time-consuming and complex. But some believe he may warm to the idea if its forces RBS to lend more. Will taxpayers get their money back? This is the big question. Taxpayers are currently sitting on a £17billion loss on their 81 per cent stake in RBS. They may yet get the bulk of their money back but there is growing speculation the Coalition is softening up the public to sell shares at a loss, pinning the blame on the last Labour government for paying too much for its stake in RBS and Lloyds when they were bailed out during the financial crisis. RBS has indicated it wants to start selling off shares by the end of next year. But Treasury insiders are now insisting there is ‘no rush’. Earlier this week Business Secretary . Vince Cable launched an attack on the bank’s lending record, saying . entrepreneurs were becoming even ‘angrier’ at the lack of available . credit. RBS remains Britain’s biggest business . lender. But despite pressure from ministers, the bank’s net lending has . fallen by £4billion in the last 12 months. Mr Cable said the economy was . being held back by ‘this highly centralised, dysfunctional banking . structure’. Mr Hester yesterday defended RBS’s lending record, saying the bank had done a ‘terrific job’ and was ‘pulling its weight’ on lending. The major banks insist they are willing to lend and warn that using credit to prop up unviable firms will end in trouble. But the Chancellor is understood to have come round to the viewpoint of Mr Cable, who has long seen the refusal of the banks to lend as a major barrier to economic growth. The Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards is also expected to call for RBS and other major banks to increase their small business lending when it publishes its long-awaited report on the future of the industry next week. Speaking in the Commons, the Commission’s Tory chairman Andrew Tyrie said: ‘They need an RBS that is fully functioning for the first time in many years.’ Mr Javid said Mr Osborne had not been ‘directly involved’ in meeting Mr Hester to discuss his removal. But Mr Hester did not deny speculation the two men did not get on, revealing they had not spoken for three months. Lord . Myners, the former City minister, told the BBC Mr Osborne had made Mr . Hester’s position ‘close to impossible’ and that the board – dominated . by UKFI, which manages the Government’s shareholding – was ‘doing the . bidding’ of the Chancellor. Mr . Hester, who will leave at the end of this year with a pay-off worth up . to £5.6million, was widely praised for bringing RBS back from the brink . of collapse. RBS yesterday confirmed it was shedding 2,000 jobs from its investment banking arm.","RBS chief executive Stephen Hester forced out in a George Osborne 'coup'

A ‘no win, no fee’ legal firm that supported a prison inmate’s fraudulent compensation claim has come under fierce attack from a judge. Noel Jennings, 23, lied that he had gashed his head after slipping on a wet floor outside his cell in an attempt to deceive a prison into paying him £6,000. In reality he had sustained the injury play-fighting with another inmate and his lie was exposed when he was recorded bragging about the plan to his girlfriend in a telephone call from prison. Jailing the serial criminal for two years for perverting the course of justice, Judge Martin Steiger QC attacked the solicitors that backed his case. He added that ‘the prison governor would be fully justified in banning’ Taylor Legal from representing inmates at the jail for ‘taking no steps to find out this was a deceitful claim’. Prison officials are understood to have reported the firm to the Solicitors Regulation Authority. Judge Steiger told Jennings: ‘Prisoners making false claims for damages through solicitors or otherwise will be heavily penalised.’ Manchester Crown Court heard that Jennings, who has 20 previous convictions, was serving time for burglary at Strangeways jail in Manchester when he suffered the 2 inch gash in a fight. The injury was caused when he attempted to butt a fellow inmate but instead cut his head on the door of his cell. Katie Jones, prosecuting, said Jennings’s cell was next to the showers, so he ‘hatched a plan’ to try to con money from the jail by blaming it on a slippery floor. But five days after the incident last December, during routine monitoring of prisoners’ phone calls, Jennings was overheard telling his girlfriend how he planned to make thousands from the scam. Despite this, the prison continued to . investigate the complaint, and so Jennings repeated the lie to a health . and safety officer and instructed Taylor Legal to pursue his claim for . £6,000 damages. In February the firm wrote to prison . bosses alleging negligence. Jennings was arrested after being confronted . with the incriminating phone call. The 23-year-old, who has 20 previous convictions, was serving time for burglary when he hatched the plan in Strangeways to scam cash from HMP Manchester last December . In a police interview he admitted: ‘I . thought because the showers were leaking I could make some money out of . it because there was nothing there to say that the floor was wet.’ Prison staff said that at worst the . floor might have been ‘slightly dampened’ from inmates walking from the . showers back to their cells. Dan Gaskell, defending, described . Jennings’s claim as ‘an act of stupidity’, adding: ‘Whether the claim . would have got anywhere in the long run remains to be seen.’ Jennings, of Wythenshawe, Manchester, also admitted robbery. Taylor Legal’s director, Glyn Taylor, . said: ‘We are carrying out an internal inquiry and will co-operate . fully with any investigation by the Solicitors Regulation Authority.’ According to its website, the firm is a small practice specialising in personal injury and mis-selling claims. It is understood not to carry out . regular work with prisoners and is likely to tell any inquiry it had no . reason not to take Jennings’s account in good faith. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has . announced a crackdown on claims by serving prisoners, including . stripping them of legal aid for ‘unnecessary’ complaints. He says the move would mean 11,000 fewer cases annually and save the taxpayer £4million.","Noel Jennings attempted to sue Strangeways jail for thousands .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 18:56 EST, 9 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:49 EST, 10 June 2013 . A former NHS employee has described the hospital where her elderly father died as the worst she had encountered during her 30-year career. James Bollen, 92, died last week after contracting three illnesses during a four-week stay at Weston General Hospital in Somerset. The pensioner, whose family said he had always feared he would die on one of its wards, had been admitted to the hospital in Weston-super-Mare with norovirus. James Bollen, with wife Susanne, contracted three illnesses including boils after being admitted to Weston General Hospital . Jane Gill said the ward her father died on was the worst she had seen in her 30 years working in the NHS . His daughter Jane Gill said the hospital was ‘filthy’ and understaffed. The former senior pharmacy technician, who has worked at ten hospitals, said: ‘I have never seen such disregard for patients, relatives and a lack of cleanliness. ‘I have been retired five years having worked in a chemotherapy ward and know how important hygiene is.’ Mrs Gill, 53, from Yatton, north Somerset, claims her father went without food or water in the month during his stay and accused the hospital of ‘starving him to death’. She said she passed out from shock when she went to identify his ‘emaciated’ body. She said: ‘The lack of dignity and care shown to him was appalling. ‘They denied him food, they didn’t care. When I went to identify him he was in a dirty gown, unshaven and I was so shocked I passed out. ‘Nine days before he went into hospital he was told he was in excellent condition for a 92-year-old. ‘I didn’t recognise him four weeks [later]. He was thin and emaciated. He looked like he had come out of a concentration camp.’ Her father had an IV drip which was on ‘sporadically’, she said. After two weeks he was given a feeding tube. Mr Bollen’s widow, Susanne, said by the end she hardly recognised her husband of 62 years and regretted the trust did not agree to move him to another hospital, as the family requested. She said: ‘The last thing he said to me was, “Food, food.” I’ll never forget that.’ Mrs Gill, a full-time carer who lives with her husband Melvin, has called for an inquest and fears the hospital could turn into ‘another Mid-Staffs’. She added: ‘I worked in hospitals for 30 years, I know how they should look and I’ve never seen anything like it at Weston, it was disgusting.’ It is understood Weston General Hospital is for sale as bosses struggle to deal with a £3.5million deficit. Mr Bollen, who suffered from Parkinson’s Disease, was taken there on April 29 after catching the norovirus. His health improved but after moving on to the Kewstoke Ward he contracted hospital pneumonia, septicaemia and boils. Mrs Gill said her father, pictured left on his wedding day in 1950 and right on his 90th birthday, always feared he would die in the hospital and claims he went without food and water during his one month stay . Mrs Gill said the family have complained to the trust that runs Weston General Hospital. The trust said it had invested £1.7million on improving staff levels . Mrs Gill said the illnesses’ specialist nurse was on leave without cover arranged. ‘I kept saying he needs his Parkinson’s medication, he needs food, he needs water,’ she said. Mr Bollen also could not reach an alarm to call nurses and was out of sight of their work station. Mrs Gill does not believe her father was on the Liverpool Care Pathway.

Settling down in her kitchen with a cup of tea one morning last October, mother-of-two Mandy Brazil sat back and switched on Lorraine. It is a routine she has performed hundreds of times before - but this time it would save her life. After watching a special edition dedicated to spotting hidden signs of breast cancer, Mrs Brazil became concerned she might be showing symptoms of the disease and immediately booked herself an appointment with her GP. Mandy Brazil, 47, was diagnosed with breast cancer after seeing the symptoms on a special edition of morning TV show, Lorraine. After watching the programme she immediately made an appointment with her GP . Mrs Brazil (pictured before her diagnosis) realised she had the symptoms mentioned on the programme - these included a nipple suddenly inverting, dimpling around the nipple and pain in the breasts or armpits . Tests subsequently revealed she did, in fact, have a tumour and after chemotherapy and surgery she is now celebrating defeating cancer because she caught it early. A lump or an area of thickened tissue in the breast. A change in the size or shape of one or both breasts. Discharge from either nipple. A lump or swelling in the armpit. Dimpling of the skin of the breast. A rash on or around the nipple. Changes to the appearance of the nipple. Pain in the breasts or armpits. Source: NHS Choices . Mrs Brazil, who owns a lighting business with husband Glen, 51, says she owes her survival to Lorraine Kelly and Dr Hilary Jones, the on-screen expert with whom she discussed breast cancer on the show. ‘If it hadn’t been for me watching that edition of Lorraine I might have waited to go to the doctor and the cancer would have spread without me knowing,’ she said. ‘I now say that Lorraine and Dr Hilary saved my life.’ Mrs Brazil, 47, had ignored her . symptoms for months until she watched the ITV show that morning last . autumn, in which Lorraine, 53 - who has long supported cancer charities - . urged viewers to check themselves for abnormalities. As . part of a ‘breast awareness week’, the show discussed hidden symptoms - . such as women suddenly developing an inverted nipple, dimpling around . the nipple and unusual pain in the breasts or armpits. Mrs Brazil (pictured with husband, Glen, before her diagnosis) has endured surgery to remove the tumour, chemotherapy and radiotherapy . Mrs Brazil, from Redditch in . Worcestershire, was concerned she had two of the three symptoms and . booked an appointment with her GP. She was then referred to a specialist . and had a mammogram which revealed she had a 10p-sized cancerous tumour . behind her right nipple. She was treated with chemotherapy and had the tumour removed by operation in November. As a result of catching the cancer early, Mandy avoided having a full mastectomy. Yesterday she described the moment it dawned on her that she might have breast cancer. Mrs Brazil says she owes her survival to Lorraine Kelly (left) and . Dr Hilary Jones (right). During the show, Lorraine discussed breast cancer with the on-screen expert . ‘I generally always have the telly on . in the background in the morning while I’m pottering about in the . kitchen and settle down with a cuppa to watch Lorraine. ‘At . that time they were doing a breast awareness week and Dr Hilary Jones . was being interviewed and explained the symptoms and warning signs. ‘I . knew myself there was something wrong but had tried to ignore it up . until that point - I didn’t have any lumps so I thought it couldn’t be . cancer. ‘But they started talking about three different symptoms and I realised that I ticked two on the list.’ She added ‘Watching Lorraine and Dr Hilary gave me the nudge I needed. I said to my husband: “I need to get this looked at”. ‘I . thought: “I’ve got to face up to this” but when I got the news that . they had found a tumour my feet didn’t quite touch the floor. ‘They found cancerous cells in my lymph nodes so got me straight on to the chemotherapy. Mrs Brazil is going to appear on Lorraine next week to thank the presenter and Dr Hilary Jones for saving her life . ‘Luckily my body responded really well to the treatment and I only had to have a lumpectomy rather than a breast removal which was a huge relief.’ Last week Mrs Brazil completed an intensive course of radiotherapy to reduce the risk of the cancer coming back. To mark the end of her treatment, her daughter Kelly, 26, is running in her local Race for Life this Sunday to raise money for Cancer Research. And next week, Mrs Brazil is joining Lorraine on the sofa to thank her and Dr Hilary in person. ‘I’m so grateful to them. I think I’ll give them both a big hug. I just hope women everywhere check themselves regularly. It takes five minutes but can save your life,’ she added.","Mandy Brazil, 47, saw edition of Lorraine dedicated to highlighting symptoms .

Extraordinary: Alan Whitwell, pictured leaving the Dale Cregan trial, told how the killer arrived at his house and demanded a haircut and a bath . A barber has today told how after five weeks on the run, serial killer Dale Cregan arrived at his home demanding a haircut saying: 'I want to look good in court'. Alan Whitwell, 34, was held captive with his girlfriend and her daughter in their Manchester house, while the one-eyed gangster plotted to murder the police. On his 'last night of freedom' before gunning down PCs Nicola Hughes, 23, and Fiona Bone, 32, Cregan celebrated with 'beer and cigars' and placed a grenade on . the mantlepiece and his gun on the arm of the sofa. Cregan then demanded a haircut before he started his killing spree, but Mr Whitwell feared he might be killed because he didn't have his cutting equipment with him. 'He was asking for a ""chop"" but my clippers were in my shop. I thought I was going to die because I didn't have my clippers,' he told The Sun. After using scissors to trim Cregan's hair and beard in the back garden, he then ran Cregan a bath. The next morning, September 18 2012, Cregan called 999 from Alan's bedroom to report a hoax burglary at the home in Hattersley, Greater Manchester, telling a call handler a concrete slab had been thrown through a window. He calmly ended the five-minute conversation by saying: 'I'll be waiting', before shooting the police officers more than 30 times when they arrived, before throwing a grenade at them while they lay dying on the lawn. Attack: Dale Cregan had forced his way into Alan Whitwell's home (pictured) and late gunned down the police outside . Mr Whitwell said when it happened it was like 'a scene from The Terminator'. 'I saw the gun in his hand and he mumbled something about the police. I heard the front door open and then just heard ‘Bam!’ he told The Sun. 'The shots seemed to go on for ever. Then I saw him pull the pin out of the grenade and throw it back towards the house. 'I thought the house was going to fall to bits because the boom was just incredible. ‘I can still hear the noise of the gun . being fired. I then heard a massive explosion. It shook the house. I . immediately thought it was the grenade he had brought with him.’ Home: Forensic officers last September at the scene close to where police constables Fiona Bone, 32, and Nicola Hughes, 23, where shot dead by Dale Cregan in Hattersley, Greater Manchester . Evidence: A Glock handgun (right) found at the scene of the murders committed by Dale Cregan (left), 30. Barber Alan Whitwell said the scene unfolded like something from the Terminator film series . Cregan then dumped his glock handgun beside the bodies before handing himself at the local police station and said: 'I’ve murdered two police officers'. A day earlier Cregan had arrived at Mr Whitwell's and then forced his way in through the back door. ‘I was really scared. I was immediately horrified and feared for my life. Dale Cregan was the last person I expected to be at my home,' he told Preston Crown Court. ‘I knew Dale Cregan was wanted by the police for murders. He just walked in and said, ‘Get in.’ He said to me, ""Do as I say"" and basically saying if you don’t you will get hurt.’ Mr Whitwell then went upstairs to tell his girlfriend what was happening and she was ‘absolutely petrified’ and only knew Cregan from what she had seen on the TV. Killings: Cregan shot Pc Nicola Hughes (left) eight times, including three strikes to the head as she lay on the . ground. Pc Fiona Bone (right) was hit up to eight times after she . managed to draw and fire her Taser . Scene: Cregan discharged 32 bullets in total in barely half a minute. He then left his 'calling card' of a military grenade which he threw it onto the path where the two officers lay . Mr Whitwell told the court: ‘Dale then pulled out a grenade then placed that on the fireplace. I was terrified. If someone has got a gun and a grenade I will do whatever they want.’ ‘Throughout this incident we were in shock and fear, I honestly believed one of us would be killed if we had not done as we were told. ‘Cregan had a gun and grenade while at my house. I was just going to do whatever he said or told me to do so he would go away as soon as possible.’ He said Cregan made a number of phone calls in an attempt to get some cocaine and then sent out for beer, cigarettes and two big cigars. Mr Whitwell, who said Cregan was looking at a laptop, said: ‘Cregan spoke about the incidents he had already been involved in, about how he had done it,’ said Mr Whitwell. Towards dawn Cregan then took a bath in at the house and asked the hairdresser to cut his hair before putting on a set of clean clothes. Around 5.30am the next morning Mr Whitwell went to work, to keep the appearance of normality, but he came back home as he was worrying about his family. By now Cregan had finalised his plan and phoned up the police reporting a spurious burglary to lay a trap for officers.","Alan Whitwell was held captive by killer on his 'last night of freedom'

The account is managed by Arias' friend, Donavan Bering, who updates the account with messages from Arias after speaking to the accused killer on the phone, Fox reported.

Another . reads, 'Those afflicted with Little Man's Syndrome taint society's . perception of genuinely good men who happen to be vertically . challenged.' On Wednesday . night, Bering reportedly posted a link to Arias' personal website, where . she is selling and holding auctions for artwork. Arias says the killing was self-defense, and that on the day of Travis Alexander's death in June 2008 at his suburban Phoenix home, he attacked her and she was forced to fight for her life. However, no other evidence — other than Arias' accounts — has been presented at trial showing Alexander had ever been physically violent. Authorities say Arias planned the attack.

Many . of the injured were taken to the nearby Nobles Hospital. None of the . people involved are thought to have suffered life-threatening injuries. Bray Hill is one of the most difficult bits of the 37.7 mile race track which snakes its way round the islands. The annual Isle of Man TT and Manx Grand Prix have claimed the lives of 50 racers and spectators since the year 2000. Japanese racer Yoshinari Matsushit, 43, was the most recent person to die when he crashed in a qualifying session 10 days ago. In the last 13 years, 45 riders have been killed, two spectators and three officials. The Manx Grand Prix is held in August and is for amateur riders. Last year racers Trevor Ferguson and Steve Osborne died in the August event. In 2007, two spectators and a rider were killed in the Isle of Man TT. Dean Jacob, 33, and Gregory Kenzig, 52, from Australia were both died after being hit at the side of the track. Racer Marc Ramsbotham, 34, also died at the scene. Riders have to bend to the left as they travel downhill before flicking to the right as it rises again with a bump at the bottom of the hill. The best riders tackle the section at speeds approaching 200mph. Eyewitness Phil Bancroft Tweeted that several people were badly hurt and he had been hit by bits of broken bike. He wrote: 'I'm ok. Just. Shaking like a leaf. Bike heading for me. Just ducked. Hit by bits of bike. Ok thou. 'Some people badly injured. I'm off home the long way around.' An Isle of Man police spokesman said: 'As you will be aware there was an incident in racing on the first lap of the senior at Bray Hill which involved the race being red flagged. 'A number of casualties were taken to hospital. Injuries in some cases were serious but are not believed to be life threatening. 'We are now looking at a 4.30pm start for racing, a full six laps which will take us obviously over two hours of racing. 'It looks like it will be 7pm before we get the roads open.'

He was also 2008 Motegi Endurance race winner. The time trial event is held on a 15 mile track on public roads. The future of the event has repeatedly been called into question because of safety concerns. Every year on 'Mad Sunday' the racetrack is open up to all motorbike riders so they can try out the same tarmac as the professionals.

Former Cleveland Police Authority chairman Dave McLuckie (above) is facing a charge of perverting the course of justice after being accused of asking a friend to take his speeding points . A former police chief persuaded a friend to take speeding points for him so he would avoid jeopardising his chances of the top job, a court heard today. Dave McLuckie, then vice-chairman of Cleveland Police Authority but on the brink of becoming chairman, needed a 'big favour' to help him avoid a driving ban, Newcastle Crown Court heard. The 51-year-old, from North . Yorkshire, denies perverting the course of justice after being accused of asking his late friend Maurice Ward to take his three speeding points instead. Mr McLuckie was caught doing 36mph in a . 30mph zone in Cleveland in April 2005 in his black Peugeot. He already had nine points on his licence for speeding and was facing a ban if he got three more, the jury heard. Suspicion was only raised after Mr Ward died of cancer in 2012 and details of what he did for Mr McLuckie were discovered in his diary by his widow, prosecutor Nick Dry told the jury. Mr Ward's daughter Donna told a local councillor about her discovery and the police were informed. But Mr McLuckie told police after his arrest the allegation was 'motivated by malice' after the pair's friendship had 'soured'. Mr Ward felt the police authority chairman had not visited him in hospital when he fell ill with the disease in 2007, the court heard. Mr Dry said: 'The . defendant was the vice chairman of the Cleveland Police Authority with . the view to making the step up to being chairman. 'He also had nine points on his . licence all accrued for previous speeding offences, a further three . would lead to a driving disqualification. 'In . this circumstance the defendant turned to his then-friend Maurice Ward . and asked him to do a big favour by taking the points and Mr Ward’s . licence was endorsed.' Mr Dry added Mr . McLuckie didn't specifically deny being the driver, but claimed he had . spoken to Mr Ward who agreed he had probably been driving the car . on that occasion. The car was registered and insured in Mr McLuckie's name. Mrs . Ward told the court the two families knew each other from living in the same village in Cleveland. Her son began a relationship with .

A company called 4Sphere is putting a new  - pardon the pun - spin on a 5,500-year-old classic: the wheel. Wheels, as most everyone knows, are round. But not 4Sphere's Shark Wheel - rather, a Shark Wheel, designed for skateboards, is formed around a cubed center, which its inventor claims allows it to ride faster and smoother than your traditional round skateboard wheel. In other words, the company has literally reinvented the wheel. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Behold! The wheel - reinvented . Shark Wheels . 'When used on hard surfaces, the Shark Wheel produces a low friction profile similar to a high performance, low rolling resistance tire,' the company says on its Kickstarter page. 'This allows for less energy to be used as the contact patch is very small.  Conversely, a wheel that would normally work well as a low resistance wheel would perform poorly in something like soft sand.' Shark Wheels are made up of three, helical-shaped strips that, when rolling, form a sine wave pattern when they make contact with the ground. This pattern allows the wheel to roll faster than a traditional round wheel, the company claims, and provides better handling on rough, wet terrain. The man who reinvented the wheel: David Patrick says he's been an avid skateboarder all his life . 'It kept on going': Patrick says he dropped this 'rectangle' accidentally and noticed that it rolled . 'When encountering soft surfaces, the patented design of the Shark Wheel . produces a much wider, high friction profile which creates a wide . surface area and unsurpassed grip, the company says. 'This ability to travel on soft . surfaces is very similar to the way a sidewinder snake moves through the . sand.' Shark Wheel inventor David Patrick says he got the idea for the wheel when he used six different shapes to form a perfect cube. He dropped the cube accidentally and it rolled. 'Not only did it roll,' he says in a promotional video for the Shark Wheel, 'it kept on going. The helix shape of it was perfectly balanced so no matter what the terrain, it kept on going.' Shark Wheels . Lame: round wheels are sooo 3000 B.C. Sidewinder: Patrick says the Shark Wheel works similar to how a 'sidewinder snake moves through the sand' The company recently started a campaign on Kickstarter - an online fundraising website where the general public can contribute money to creative ideas - that already has garnered more than $30,000 in 10 days. The company's initial fundraising goal was $10,000. Patrick says the company already has plans for the wheel designed and tested. He says it will use the money from Kickstarter to start mass-producing the square-shaped wheels soon.","'Shark Wheels' are made of three, helical-shaped strips that, when rolling, form a sine wave pattern when they make contact with the ground .

Fined: Michael Peck, 79, found a £70 parking ticket on his broken-down car windscreen after he briefly left it unattended to call for help . A pensioner hit with a parking ticket when he briefly left his broken-down car unattended while he called for help says the fine is 'a sad reflection of the selfish society we live in'. Michael Peck, 79, was just yards away from his doctors' surgery when his car ran out of petrol and stalled in the middle of the road in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex. The grandfather-of-four then spent more than five minutes trying to push his light blue Hyundai IX20 off the road to make sure it was no longer a hazard to other motorists before heading to a nearby newsagents to phone for help. But he was left stunned when he returned a few minutes later to find a 'jobsworth' traffic warden had left a £70 ticket on his car windscreen for blocking the carriageway. The retired financial advisor said: 'When I grew up, if the village bobby had come along and found a driver in that predicament, his instinct would have been to take off his jacket, roll up his sleeves and help move the car. 'This jobsworth clearly must have seen me struggling - yet instead of helping he was more concerned about the money that could be made. 'It is a sad reflection of the way that we live in a very selfish society - it reflects the lack of civility and common courtesy.' Mr Peck now plans to protest against the £70 fine issued by the warden employed by Southend Council. Mr Peck, who lives with long-term partner, Kathy, 68, added: 'It was annoying because a couple of more able-bodied, younger men were laughing at my efforts to move the car rather than try to help me. 'It took an almighty effort to move the car - it must weigh a tonne - and I was absolutely shattered as it was one heck of an effort. Destination: Mr Peck was just yards away from the car park entrance of his doctor's surgery in Leigh-On-Sea, Essex, when his car ran out of petrol and stalled in the middle of the road . Rules of the road: Mr Peck was given the ticket for causing an obstruction to other motorists by blocking the carriageway on Rayleigh Road, pictured, in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex . 'I got it as far as the sleeping policeman - the traffic hump in the road - and then I could not get any further. 'It was an amazing effort to push it as far as I did - and where it stopped certainly was not obstructing anybody and then I went to call Kathy to bring some petrol from the lawnmower. 'As I was stood in the shop, the newsagent said ""someone is fiddling with your windscreen"" and by the time I got out to the car, the ticket had been slapped on there - I think he may have been on a scooter as it was that fast.' Derek Kenyon, Southend Council’s parking manager, said: 'If anyone wishes to challenge a penalty charge notice, then there are set procedures to follow, laid down by the Department of Transport. 'If there is a claim that a vehicle has broken down, then we would need evidence to support that - such as the relevant repair bill or details from breakdown assistance services.' Appeal: Mr Peck found the ticket on his windscreen after he briefly left his vehicle to call for help. He plans to appeal against the £70 fine issued by a warden employed by Southend Council .","Michael Peck's Hyundai ran out of petrol just yards from his doctors' surgery .

As the cultural safeguards of Shakespeare’s hometown, the lofty folk of Stratford-upon-Avon pride themselves on the very highest standards of taste. So when swan-shaped plastic pedalos were suggested for the River Avon, Town Hall bosses were mortified, declaring: ‘We’re not Stratford-on-Blackpool'. While their actions may have spared residents the sight of the ‘plastic monstrosities’, their comments have also resulted in an almighty row between the two cities. 'Plastic monstrosities': Politicians and residents welcomed Stratford-upon-Avon's decision to reject the swan pedalos . Dispute: The swan boats have proved popular in nearby Warwick but councillors in Stratford-upon-Avon do not approve . Blackpool tourist bosses have now hit back at the ‘cheap shot’, while the those in Stratford are refusing to apologise. ‘The people of Stratford are not being snobby, but Stratford is not Blackpool,’ the former mayor said yesterday. ‘We have a cultural and historical status to uphold, and these ginormous swans are not a part of that.’ Boating bosses had applied to Stratford District Council to replace four motor boats for public hire with the two-metre high plastic swan pedalos. Row: Tourist bosses in Blackpool have hit back at the comments by Stratford-upon-Avon councillors calling it 'a cheap joke' Despite the swans being used just nine miles down the river, in front of Warwick castle, the council rejected the application, deciding the boats were 'not in keeping with the historical or cultural nature of the town’. The decision was welcomed by residents and local politicians. Former Mayor of Stratford Cyril . Bennis, said: ‘I'm very pleased with the council's decision. These huge . gigantic swans are totally out of keeping with our river environment. 'They're totally void of all common decency. This is Stratford-upon-Avon, . not Stratford-on-Blackpool. ‘I have no objection to swans - I've been the official keeper of the swans in Stratford for more than 30 years. ‘But . these plastic monstrosities cannot be allowed in our towns. They have . their place, but it's different strokes for different folk.’ Blackpool council . chiefs are furious about the comments, calling them a ‘cheap shot’ and . saying residents in Stratford are ‘looking down their noses’. Conservative Councillor Tony Lee, a . former Deputy Mayor for Blackpool, said: ‘It winds me up. 'We know it's . not the best place in the world for jobs and the weather isn't always . perfect here but there's some lovely places to stay and lovely things to . do here. ‘I think it's most . rude. We have got so much to offer here. Everyone passes opinions but I bet he's never even been here.'

Reverend Caroline Wright was among 250 women who agreed to take part in the photoshoot to raise money for charity . A female priest has spoken of how she had no hesitation at all before stripping off and posing topless for a charity wallpaper. Reverend Caroline Wright, an associate priest at St Michael’s Church in Smethcote, Shropshire, was among 250 women who agreed to take part in the photoshoot to raise money for breast awareness charity Coppafeel. The 65-year-old, who conducts weddings and funerals and plays the organ at the rural 12th century church, said the topless photo shoot by local artist Sam Powley was 'great fun'. Reverend Wright, who is a grandmother of 12 and has been ordained for four years, said she had no hesitation in taking part in the project - but she is not revealing where she is on the wallpaper. She said: 'Body awareness in young women is so important. I didn’t even think about the fact I was a priest until I bumped into a parishioner at the photoshoot. 'The thought of exposing myself in a perfectly secure environment didn’t bother me in the least. I looked around the room and saw all those women together, different ages, shapes and sizes and it was really powerful and great fun. 'We all need to love our bodies. If we love them we don’t treat them badly. I do think the way the project was done was reverential in that sense - we are all made in God’s image. 'Sam’s wallpaper makes you realise how unique and individual we all are.' Reverend Wright signed up for the photoshoot after seeing the 38-year-old artist's plea for female volunteers on Facebook. Ms Powley spent eight months photographing hundreds of women’s breasts at Shrewsbury Coffeehouse and other venues in Hertfordshire, North Wales and Birmingham. She then put the pictures together to form a sheet of wallpaper, which was unveiled at her fine art degree show at Birmingham City University this week. Reverend Wright said she had no hesitation in taking part in the project . The paper has now gone on sale for . £100 a roll, with a quarter of the profits going to the charity . Coppafeel, which sends teams out to festivals to teach young people how . to examine their breasts. She said: 'I’m really pleased with the result and I’m chuffed that people are reacting to it in such a lovely positive way. 'I wanted to celebrate the female . form. The most important part of the project is not the boobs on the . wall, it’s the relationship between me and the subjects. 'So many people found it cathartic and liberating, a really important, emotive thing to be part of. 'I . started off thinking many women didn’t really like their boobs but I’ve . been really interested to find just how many people love them.' Anni . Holden, director of communications for the Hereford Diocese, said it was important as many people as possible got involved in supporting the cause. She said: 'It is equally as important to . our female priests as for other ladies. Reverend Wright conducts weddings and funerals and plays the organ at St Michael's Church in Smethcote, Shropshire . 'We would like to see any of our priests getting involved in anything supporting breast cancer charities.' Other women who took part in the . project included transgender Tessa Curtis, 54, from Worcester, who said . her breasts were 'in progress'. She said: 'I am taking medication and they are growing but I was a bit concerned I might not qualify. 'I was worried the presence of a . transgender person might cause offence but I wanted to support it. I . went on my own and was made to feel very welcome as part of the . sisterhood. It was very interesting and enjoyable.' 'I didn’t even think about the fact I was a priest until I bumped into a parishioner at the photoshoot' - Reverend Caroline Wright . Helen Nicell, 51, from Watford, said her family had been 'plagued' by cancer so she wanted to support the project. She found a lump in her own breast on . the day her mum died of breast cancer and has also lost her husband and . dad to the disease. She had a mastectomy in 2010, but a further growth was detected in her spine last year. She said: 'Going to a topless photoshoot with just one boob was quite out there. 'Breast . cancer is something we are all very concerned about in our family. I . discovered my own when I found my nipple had completely changed shape. 'Self-checking . is so important.

Former Conservative Shropshire councillor Karen Burgoyne, 49, said she was pleased she took part. She added: 'You feel a glow of confidence afterwards. Everybody went in nervous but came out smiling. Cancer touches so many lives, I wanted to do my bit.' Ms Powley's daughter Daisy Pooley-Tolkien, 20, from Cambridge also took part in the topless shoot. She said: 'Boobs are something that can be objectified or appreciated and my mum has really shown the appreciation side. 'I found it very hard to accept that I had inverted nipples when I was a teenager. This was really my way of saying, you know what, I really don’t care any more. It isn’t just me - I’m not a complete freak.' Ms Powley now hopes the paper might be showcased by a major high street store and would also like to see it papering the walls of bathrooms across the country. She has already raised more than £2,000 for Coppafeel and will be taking orders for the wallpaper via her website boobwallpaper.com from the end of the week.","Elaborate wallpaper designed to raise money for charity Coppafeel .

Historians seeking to identify a troop of fallen World War One soldiers could be one step closer to cracking the 99 year mystery after tracing the descendant of a young man killed in France in 1914. The group of unknown soldiers, who fell during heavy gunfire during a battle in Beaucamps-Ligny, France, could be identified thanks to DNA provided by the great-nephew of Private Frederick Thompson, who was reported missing in action at the age of 20. It is believed Private Frederick could be one of the 15 found at the site in France in 2009. Now, his great-nephew Eric Saunders, 61, . from Worcester, has submitted a DNA sample in the hope it matches with . one of the sets of remains and proves it belongs to his relative. Eric Saunders has submitted a DNA sample in the hope it will confirm one of the sets of remains of soldiers found in Beaucamps-Ligny, France, belongs to his great uncle . Private Frederick Thompson (left and right, with his wife) was reported missing in 1914 at the age of 20. Historians believe he could be one of the 15 soldiers found in Beaucamps-Ligny, France, in 2009 . And historians from the Commonwealth War Grave Commission hope that after the DNA testing has been undertaken, they will finally be able to discover their identities and give them a military funeral 100 years on. The remains of the soldiers were uncovered by farmers digging up sewers in 2009. Private Frederick Thompson, killed in action early in the First World War, may be identified nearly a century after his death . Archaeologists uncovered partial skeletal remains of 15 men - alongside toothbrushes, and brass buttons proving the men belonged to the 2nd Battalion York and Lancaster Regiment - after their remains were uncovered by farmers digging up sewers in 2009. One young soldier, Private Frederick Thompson, killed in action early in the First World War may be identified nearly a century after his death, from DNA provided by his great-nephew, in one of the first DNA tests on the soldier's remains. The commission managed to track down Private Thompson’s closest living relative, his great nephew Mr Saunders, and they are now awaiting the results of his DNA test to see if Private Thompson will be the first unknown soldier to be identified. Mr Saunders said: 'I had no idea that any of my relatives served in the Great War. I feel immensely proud to discover that my great uncle fought for his country. 'I was stunned to discover that he had been killed at the age of just 20. 'I have grandchildren that age myself, and I can’t even begin to imagine what those soldier’s poor mothers went through. 'I know it happened to a lot of people but it really hits home to find out that happened to one of my own relatives. 'I didn’t really know anything about my mother’s side of the family. We were both shocked. The number of discoveries of remains varies from year to year, but since 2003 the Commonwealth War Graves Commission has dealt with an average of about 18 cases each year. Over the last decade the highest number of discoveries was in 2007 when 24 cases were found, while the lowest was 12 cases in 2011. Each case can involve multiple sets of remains - bomber crews for example commonly involve seven casualties - but generally discoveries are of one or two casualties at a time. The most common cause of discoveries are building work or farmers ploughing fields. The vast majority of cases are in France and Belgium . In all instances, the responsibility for investigation and identification rests with the relevant service authority - the armed forces of the country for which the individual was serving. The commission’s responsibility begins when the remains are handed over for burial. The commission then identifies the appropriate cemetery - usually the closest Commonwealth War Cemetery in which there is space - manufacture the headstone, prepare the grave and care for the individual in perpetuity once the burial has taken place. 'I was very keen to give a DNA sample to try and prove the identity of these unknown heroes. 'I’ve . been told it may take several months to come back with a result, but I . hope I can do my bit to give those men the proper funeral they deserve. 'I’ve said that I would like to attend the funeral ceremony for the men, even if it turns out not to be my uncle’s remains. I feel as though I have a bond with those men now.' The 2nd Battalion York and Lancaster Regiment had been based in Ireland at the outbreak of the war, landing in France on September 9, 1914, and taking part in the Battle of Armentihres. The battalion then headed to fight with the 6th Division along a line from Preniesques to Radinghem in an action that lasted from October 20 to 31. All the men will be laid to rest in the same graveyard with full military honours, to mark the centenary of their deaths in October 2014. An MOD spokesman said: 'The use of DNA can in some cases enable us to confirm the identity of remains that are discovered, but after many decades results may be inconclusive. We always take steps to make families fully aware of this possibility. 'DNA testing is only used where there is a realistic chance of a positive match being obtained and may not be appropriate in all cases. 'The JCCC Historic Casework team undertakes a unique and essential role in investigating where remains of British Service Personnel are found on wartime battlefields and is always mindful that their work often closes a chapter for families who have lost loved ones many years ago.'

Joseph Miley has been suspended by the Army after an investigation intosexual misconduct . The Army has suspended a top commander for sexual misconduct after a five-month investigation into claims that he had condoned romantic affairs among his troops and promoted a sexy pinup calendar of female soldiers. Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Miley, commander of the 49th Missile Defense Battalion at Fort Greely, Alaska, will remain on suspension until his case is reviewed by higher-ups who determine what further action is needed, Politico reported. The Army began investigating Miley in January for his involvement in the pinup calendar, which featured scantily clad women - including his wife and female troops - posing in sexually suggestive ways. His wife's spread shows her wearing . only lacy underwear and red heels, while her chest is covered by an old . vinyl record. The proceeds from the calendar were donated to the . American Cancer Society. When investigators dug deeper, they . found reason to believe that Miley had also been encouraging sexual . affairs among his troops. Soldiers at the anti-ballistic . missile base claimed he had created a 'toxic environment' by turning a . blind eye to cases of sexual misconduct. At least 16 women serve at Fort . Greely, a launch site for anti-ballistic-missile missiles, such as the . ones the U.S. fears are being developed in Iran and North Korea. Target: Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Miley's wife, Tracey, featured as the August picture on a racy calender he approved of women at the base . Military officials told NBC News that . by allegedly condoning the behavior Lieutenant Colonel Miley had, in . effect, created an 'open season' when it came to sexual activity among . troops. One official said: 'It's as if that was the only thing to do' at the remote base. It comes as the Department of Defense . increases its efforts to prevent sexual assault, after reporting this . month that the number of cases has increased in the past year. Figures released by the Department of . Defense estimate there were 26,000 cases of unwanted sexual contact, . from groping to rape, in 2012. This was a 35 per cent rise in the number . of cases reported in 2010. Two Army officers assigned to prevent . sexual assault are also currently under investigation for alleged . attacks, according to CNN.

In Arlington, an Air Force officer . responsible for an assault prevention unit has been charged with sexual . battery after allegedly fondling a woman in the car park near his . office. A Fort Bragg soldier who helps run . the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program at the North Carolina . base, said sexual assault damaged the strong bonds within the Army. 'This crime of violence, soldier upon soldier, it breaks your trust,' Sgt First Class Josalette R. Simmons, said.

It's a tradition going back a quarter of a century, but really not one where you want to spill the red wine. Thousands of foodies dressed from head to toe in sparkling white converged on Paris last night to quaff champagne and eat fine foods together as the annual Diner en Blanc celebrated its 25th birthday. Diners, who had signed up for the event were kept in the dark as to the location of the giant dinner party right up until the last minute, but were told to make their way to either the Trocadéro or the grounds of the Louvre via email earlier in the evening. Diner en Blanc: People, all dressed up in white, have a dinner on the Trocadero square in front of the Eiffel Tower in Paris . All white: Diners also gathered at the Louvre to celebrate the 25th birthday of the Diner en Blanc tradition that has now spread worldwide . Celebration: Diners have to dress head to toe in white and bring a picnic table and white table cloth to the event . Come dine with us: More than 15,000 people were expected to attended for dinner but only invited guests are allowed a seat . Within the hour, row upon row of picnic tables - complete with white table cloths - were set up, wine was uncorked and revellers began sharing food at the spectacular event. Guests enjoyed their dinner against the backdrop of the Eiffel Tower and the city's most iconic museum until midnight, when they pack up their rubbish and leave. The tradition began in 1988 when a group of ten friends decided they wanted to eat at a forbidden spot in the French capital. But they ended up dining as a 200 strong flash mob at the Jardins de Bagatelle, a favourite spot of French royalty including Marie Antoinette. Al fresco dining: Diners were only told the venue of the 'flashmob' dinner by email shortly before dinner started and within an hour, thousands had descended within their tables . Eat to the beat: A band entertains diners who ate al fresco in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower last night . Fine dining: Guests wore all their finest white clothes, brought china plates and bottles of champagne to toast Diner en Blanc's birthday . Packed in: Tables were arranged in rows with men supposed to sit on one side and women seated on the other and guests can only be seated once everyone in their row has set up their table . Since then the event has gone global with versions of the dinner taking place in European cities such as Milan and Barcelona and much further afield in more than a dozen locations in the US, Canada, Singapore and even Rwanda and the Ivory Coast. The craze finally made the short journey from its Paris home across the Channel to London only last September when thousands of diners converged on the South Piazza of Covent Garden. But the Paris version remains the tradition's definitive one. Each year the guest list exceeds 15,000 say organisers and past dinners have taken place at such illustrious settings as the Pont des Arts, the grounds of the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre and the Palace of Versailles.

A massive line of storms packing hail, lightning and tree-toppling winds rolled through the Midwest on Wednesday evening driving people into basements for shelter, tearing down power lines and causing flooding in low-lying areas. Forecasters predicted that by the time the storms were done, they could affect more than one in five Americans from Iowa to Maryland. In addition to tornadoes, lightning and . large hail, meteorologists warned about the possibility of a derecho -  a . storm of strong straight-line winds spanning at least 240 miles.

Powerful: Lightning strikes the Willis Tower in downtown Chicago on June 12 - a massive storm with heavy rain, high winds, hail and possible tornadoes is expected to move into much of the Midwest today . Looming: A wall cloud, containing a reported funnel cloud, passes over the Wanatah, Indiana area as a line of severe storm moves through the area today . A firefighter fights a blaze in a garage in the Black Forest area, of Colorado Springs, Colorado . The ferocious weather came as a wildfire fueled by hot temperatures, gusty winds and thick, bone-dry forests destroyed 92 homes and prompted more than 7,000 residents northeast of Colorado Springs to flee, sheriff's official said on Wednesday. A separate Colorado wildfire to the south has destroyed 20 structures, including some in Royal Gorge Bridge & Park, and prompted evacuations of about 250 residents and nearly 1,000 inmates at a medium-security prison. To the north, another fire burned in Rocky Mountain National Park. Wildfires also were burning in New Mexico, Oregon and California, where a smokejumper was killed fighting one of dozens of lightning-sparked fires. Crews were so busy battling blazes across the West that the U.S. Forest Service said it was mobilizing a pair of Defense Department cargo planes to help - a step taken only when all of the Forest Service's contracted tankers already are in use. No other injuries or deaths have been reported at this time. Midwestern . Fierce: Lightning emerges from a storm cloud over Clear Lake illuminating a lone cypress tree in LaPorte, Indiana . Take cover: A wall cloud in northern Allen County drops what appears to be a funnel cloud on Wednesday just north of Fort Wayne, Indiana . In the Midwest, small tornadoes were reported in parts of Iowa and in Illinois. In Iowa, at least two businesses and a . home were 'completely damaged,' authorities said. In the small town of Belmond, Iowa, . about 90 miles north of Des Moines, Duwayne Abel, owner of Cattleman's . Steaks & Provisions restaurant, said a tornado swept through his . business' parking lot and demolished part of the building. No one was in . the restaurant at the time. 'I was, oh, eight miles west of town . and I looked toward town and I could see a funnel cloud, having no idea . it was exactly where our restaurant was,' Mr Abel said. His wife and an employee were able to get out of the restaurant and sought shelter in a basement. A . storm ripped through a farm in rural Alexander, destroying a motor . home. Tens of thousands of people across the Upper Midwest lost power. 'We're just happy that we don't have reports of injuries or fatalities,' said Stephanie Bond with Iowa Homeland Security and Emergency Management. 'We just hope the extent of the damage is minimal.' By late Wednesday, a derecho hadn't developed, but conditions were still ripe for one, with more storms expected overnight, said Greg Carbin of the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. However he added that 'with each hour that goes by, it's less likely'. Derechoes, with winds of at least 58 mph, occur about once a year in the Midwest. Rarer than tornadoes but with weaker winds, derechoes produce damage over a much wider area. A derecho is a widespread, long-lived wind storm that is associated with a band of rapidly moving showers or thunderstorms. Last year's historic storm saw widespread destruction and meteorologists fear it could be happening again, possibly affecting 64 million people in 10 states. In 2012, a record-breaking derecho caused $1 billion in damage from Chicago to Washington. Over 4 million were without power after the June 29, 2012 storm across 11 states. To be classified as a derecho, the line of storms must travel at least 240 miles and include wind gusts of at least 58 mph. 2012's storm saw winds as great as 100 mph. It can produce destruction similar to that of tornadoes, while the damage typically is directed in one direction. As a result, the term 'straight-line wind damage' is sometimes used to describe the phenomenon. Tornadoes and a derecho can happen at the same time. Straight-line winds lack the rotation that twisters have but they can still cause considerable damage as they blow down trees and other objects. In Wisconsin, authorities said thunderstorms packing heavy rain and high winds caused a Walmart roof to partially collapse. Lake Delton Fire Chief Darren Jorgenson says two employees had minor injuries, but no customers were hurt. Street flooding was reported in parts of the village of Boscobel in Grant County. Even before the storms moved through, officials postponed Wednesday night's Chicago White Sox game against the Toronto Blue Jays and canceled a symphony concert at the city's downtown Millennium Park. The Metra commuter rail system temporarily halted all inbound and outbound trains, and Northwestern University canceled classes and finals at its campuses in Chicago and suburban Evanston. Airlines canceled more than 120 flights at O'Hare International Airport. In Indiana, the warnings prompted the Northern Indiana Public Service Co. to increase staff at its customer call center and to schedule extra work crews for any power outages. Golf-ball sized hail damaged some cars. Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency spokesman Cory Angell said a standby worker was added at the emergency operations center in Harrisburg and officials had ensured two National Guard helicopters were ready if needed for water rescues.

Wild weather: Friends and family helps clean up a farm owned by Ken and Sandy Dorenkamp after a tornado struck the area in rural Alexander, Iowa . Flood risk: Sarah Sturino wades to her vehicle in downtown Kenosha, Wisconsin, after a thunderstorm dumped at least a half-inch of water . Last year, a derecho caused at least $1 billion in damage from Chicago to Washington, killing 13 people and leaving more than 4 million people without power, according to the weather service. Winds reached nearly 100 mph in some places and in addition to the 13 people who died from downed trees, an additional 34 people died from the heat wave that followed in areas without power. For Washington, Philadelphia and parts of the Mid-Atlantic the big storm risk continues and even increases a little on Thursday, according to the weather service. Ordeal: Ken and Sandy Dorenkamp's motor home was destroyed after a tornado struck the area leaving upturned trucks and extensive damage . Batten down the hatches: Lightning sparks over downtown Chicago as dozens of flights were canceled at O'Hare Airport . The term derecho was coined in 1888, said Ken Pryor, a research meteorologist at the Center for Satellite Applications and Research at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in College Park, Md. The word is Spanish for 'straight ahead' or 'direct,' Pryor said. he structure of a derecho-producing storm looks distinctive in radar and satellite imagery, Pryor said. 'The systems are very large and have signatures that are very extreme,' he said. 'You get large areas of very cold cloud tops that you typically wouldn't see with an ordinary thunderstorm complex. The storms take on a comma or a bow shape that's very distinctive.'

An aspiring model who wishes to marry and have a family is too scared to even shake hands with a man. Hitachi Baylou, 21, has suffered from crippling OCD for three years, magnified by fear of catching a sexually transmitted disease. Completely unable to have a sexual relationship with a man - or even to come into contact with another person - Hitachi spends over £300 a month on antibacterial products, convinced she'll catch STIs from toilet seats, furniture or cupboard doors. The young woman is so terrified she will 'catch something', she panics if she so much as grazes a jacket collar when giving a hug. 'If I brush the door I panic and have to wipe my hands immediately,' she said on This Morning today. Scroll down for video . Hitachi Baylou says she's still a virgin because her OCD has robbed her of a sex life . She went on to say that men are less than understanding of her difficult condition. 'I have been on dates and described my OCD, but they just say, ""You don't need to do that"" - they think it's so simple.' Cognitive behavioural therapist Katie D'Ath joined the young woman on the breakfast television show to explain there is hope available through cognitive behavioural therapy. 'Not all cognitive behavioural therapists know how to treat people with obsessive disorders,' she says. 'Specifically, they need to practice exposure and response prevention, which is essentially where they start . to gradually expose themselves to their fear and not perform the response they . usually perform.' Brought up by a strict single mother, Hitachi Baylou developed OCD at the age of 18. 'Before I moved into my flat aged 18 I was sort of okay. OCD crept up on me, I didn't see it coming,' she said. The aspiring model has to talk to the make-up artist on shoots to ensure tools are extremely clean . 'I started using Fairy Liquid on my hands, then upgraded to baby wipes, and then to antibacterial wipes.' 'I wipe my bag handle, phone, kettle, taps... When I wake up in my room I get the wipes ready to go and wipe the kettle handle, toaster - I worry that a fly has gone in and spread bacteria. My main fear is catching something.' She later visited her mother and they had a serious conversation about the dangers of STIs. 'I went home afterwards and wiped everything very excessively. I thought, ""What if I didn't do it enough before I left"". 'It's really hard to let go of.' She's been pursuing modelling since last year, and her OCD seems to also be getting in the way of those ambitions too. 'I have to talk to the make-up artist,' she says. As well as feeling the need to ensure tools and make-up used on her face are extremely clean, she also has to talk to chefs and waiters in restaurants. 'It's really hard for people to understand. It's exhausting.' She also fears people think she is stuck up or rude. Her OCD takes on many different forms. She photographs and documents everything she eats and sometimes loses sleep and cries about her condition. 'The other day sitting on my bed in my bedroom and I got food on the mattress cover. I thought it had gone on the mattress. I kept wiping and wiping. I can't really ever relax,' she said. Hitachi now spends over £300 a month on antibacterial products, convinced she'll catch STIs . 'People with OCD need to practice exposure and response prevention, which is essentially where they start to gradually expose themselves to their fear and not perform the response they usually perform' When asked about how she would ever get intimate with someone, Hitachi confessed one of her dreams is to get into a serious relationship and have a family. 'When I see a child my heart melts. I'm very sentimental and very sensitive. While I would want a child I wouldn't want them to develop what I've got. 'I have received cognitive behavioural therapy and we've got to the connection and different things that trigger it.' Katie D'Ath said: 'A variety of different things can trigger OCD. 'A person's personality, genetics, their upbringing - a cocktail of things. Anyone could develop OCD. When those things add up enough, you get it. All of us have an element of it but usually most of us can keep it in a sub-clinical category. 'When Hitachi's mother mentioned STIs, it made her condition worse for her as she has now placed too much importance on it.' It is a mental health condition where patients experience overwhelming obsessions, compulsions or both. Obsessions are recurrent thoughts or urges that cannot be ignored and make you feel anxious. Compulsions are the actions that people feel they must do in order to deal with this anxiety. A well-known way for OCD to manifest itself is to have obsessions about dirt or contamination, and a compulsion to wash the dirt away. Ritualistic tidying is another example. When posed with the dilemma of how HItachi could overcome her OCD, Katie explained: . 'When she feels dirty her anxitey goes up and she does something to bring down, like wash her hands. 'Sometimes that works in the short term - first the Fairy liquuid then baby wipes and then antibacterial ones. So actually it doesn't work long term - only curing anxiety short term. 'What we teach is how to deal with anxiety in a different way. 'I think definitely people can be cured, though some argue that they always have it, others say it is no longer part of their life and others feel it's manageable, something in the background that sometimes crops up but doesn't really get in the way of living a normal life. It would mean the world to HItachi if she could be cured. 'I could relax. I can't remember the last time I could relax.'","Hitachi Baylou has suffered from OCD for three years .

Fight: David Cameron used a speech to workers at the new London Gateway container port near Tilbury in Essex to warn against declaring 'stop the world I want to get off' David Cameron today attacked Labour for dismissing people worried about immigration and the over-bearing power of Brussels as 'Little Englanders'. The Prime Minister used a major speech on Britain's place in the world to condemn the other . 'wrongheaded approach' of people who embrace globalisation 'so . enthusiastically that they lose sight of the national interest'. He said: 'We’re familiar with their frankly patronising approach to those who may disagree. '""You’re a Little Englander"" they say. ""You don’t get the modern world"". 'This approach – largely pursued under the last Government – didn’t feel too good for ordinary people – and frankly it didn’t do too much for our competitiveness either. 'We saw mass, uncontrolled immigration changing communities in a way people didn’t feel comfortable with, putting huge pressure on public services. 'We saw large bureaucracies like the EU having a huge impact on our way of life in a way no one voted for, while at the same time burdening our businesses with red tape and regulation. 'We saw, fundamentally, a political class too easily seduced by the rewards of globalisation – and not alert enough to the risks.' However, Mr Cameron also insisted that remaining part of the European Union is vital to Britain being able to compete in the world. He vowed to take on people who adopt a 'stop the world, I want to get off' approach and ignore the threat posed by 'leaner, fitter countries'. He claimed opponents to reforms of the ‘bloated welfare system’ and underperforming state schools are 'in denial'. The Prime Minister lay out three key goals - creating a world-class education system, reforming benefits and rebalancing the debt-fuelled economy - which he described as ‘national weaknesses’. In a bullish speech ahead of the G8 summit in Northern Ireland next week, he revealed ‘ruthless’ plans to ‘turn our country around and give all our people the best chance of success’. Taking on welfare spending, after a week in which the Labour party finally committed to caps on benefits, and economists predicted that austerity could last another decade, he said: ‘We have identified, very clearly, our key areas of national weakness compared to the rest of the world. ‘One – our debt-fuelled, unbalanced economy. Two – our bloated welfare system. Three – our under-performing education system. ‘These are the priorities that define and drive our domestic agenda. A stronger economy. Welfare that works. A world-class education system. And we are pursuing them with ruthless ambition for everyone in this country.’ The Prime Minister looked over the River Thames estuary after warning Britain cannot ignore the threat posed by emerging economies . He attacked Labour’s record on education, and say a ‘sense of opportunity’ has been lacking for too long for children in the worst performing schools. Britain’s national interests are a battle ‘on two fronts’, with the need to both competing at home and stand up for British values abroad, and every government department will be focused on the global race, he said. He also set a goal to make Britain one of the top five places in the world to do business and the number one country to do business in Europe in the next three years. 'When your prosperity is won in far-flung places, when your fortunes are disproportionately affected by what happens beyond your borders then your national interest is not just about standing up for yourself – but standing up for what’s right, and standing for something more. ‘At the UN. The Commonwealth. NATO. The WTO. The G8. The G20. And yes – the EU. Membership of these organisations is not national vanity – it is in our national interest’, he said. ‘The fact is that it is in international . institutions that many of the rules of the game are set on trade, tax . and regulation. When a country like ours is affected profoundly by those . rules, I want us to have a say on them. ‘That doesn’t mean supinely going with the flow…far from it. At the European Union we are prepared to stand up for Britain’s interests with resolve and tenacity. Vision: Mr Cameron lay out three key goals - creating a world-class education system, reforming benefits and rebalancing the debt-fuelled economy . 'In Europe, actions speak louder than words. This is about boldly pursuing our interests - not by withdrawing from the world but engaging with it.’ Mr Cameron boasted of how he secured a cut in the EU's seven-year budget, removing Britain from the Eurozone bailout mechanism and vetoing an EU Treaty. But Mr Cameron argued a single market of 500million people in Europe would be a ‘huge advantage in this world’ if it worked properly and was not bureaucratic. He added: ‘The EU is a way off that goal yet’ which is why he is seeking to negotiate a new membership deal for Britain and put it to a referendum. He highlighted investment in apprenticeships which are equivalent of a degree, and ‘re-writing the benefits system so that work actually pays.’ He went on: ‘I have a very clear vision of the country we are building. It’s . one where there is a sense of opportunity that was lacking for too . long. 'Where children in all our schools – in the roughest areas, the . places that were once written off are encouraged to dream, inspired to . learn and feel good about where they’re going. ‘Where those who want to work hard can get a good job, with prospects and a decent wage each month - enough for a home to raise their family in, enough to feel that things are getting better. 'As a parent what you want more than anything is to be able to look at your children and know they will grow up and be able to fulfil what they were born to be. ‘We tell them that if they try, they can make something of their lives. That is what we teach our children. And we need to build that country for them. Where everyone who works hard can get on. Where effort is rewarded. Where we pull together to make life better.’","Cameron outlines plans to push Britain into the top five of global business .

Naturists fear they will be forced to cover up under new laws designed to crack-down on yobs. It is claimed new measures designed to curb anti-social behaviour could be used by police and the courts to stop them stripping off in public. Nudist beaches in particular could become a thing of the past if magistrates take a personal dislike to them, it is claimed. Row: Parks and beaches could be out of bounds for naturists under new laws aimed at tackling anti-social behaviour, nudist groups have warned . The row centres on the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill, which is debated in the Commons today. It includes power for the courts to grant an injunction against someone who ‘has engaged in, or is threatening to engage in, anti-social behaviour’. Ministers say it could include not being in possession of a can of spray paint in a public place, not entering a particular area, or not being drunk in public. Home Secretary Theresa May has argued the changes will help to cut crime. 'We are delivering on our pledges to give victims of antisocial behaviour a stronger voice, further cut crime and improve the relationship between the public and police,' she said last month. Home Secretary Theresa May insist the new powers will help to cut crime . But naturist groups claim the law has been so widely drawn that police officers and magistrates courts could ‘abuse’ their position to target people who choose not to wear clothes. British Naturism branded the legislation ‘probably the most serious attack on the civil liberties of this country in decades’. In a statement it warned the new laws would pose a ‘major threat to Naturism’. It added: ‘It is well-meaning, and seeks to tackle a serious social problem, but it is so open ended that it could be used and abused to prohibit or require just about anything. ‘If history teaches us anything it is that if a power can be abused then it will be abused. ‘We have absolutely no doubt that if it becomes law as currently worded then it will be used to prohibit naturism in a wide range of places. ‘Beaches and gardens are a certainty and it may even include naturist events and clubs.’ Under the new rule, an injunction could be granted if a person has ‘engaged in conduct which is capable of causing nuisance or annoyance to any person’. Reg Barlow, chair of the Naturist Action Group, said the legislation would ‘make it so much easier for people to say that naturists have caused distress, that being a naturist and being naked in an open environment is anti-social’. ‘Because of a lack of a definition for what is anti-social, police officers are going to be put into an impossible position,’ he told The Times. He added: ‘The only way that they’ll be able to decide what to do [if a complaint is made] is to use their own moral compass about nudity and that could be religious.’ A Home Office spokesman said: ‘We want to give the police and other agencies the means to protect victims more effectively, not penalise certain behaviours. ‘The “nuisance and annoyance"" test is clear and well-established in law, and it will ultimately be for the courts to decide whether it is proportionate to grant an injunction restricting an individual from acting in a certain way.’ The Bill is expected to clear its second reading in the Commons tonight.","Courts will be able to impose injunction on anyone causing 'nuisance or annoyance'

Candlelit vigils will be held across the country to mark the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War, ministers announced today. The centrepiece of events held exactly 100 years since war was declared will be a service held at Westminster Abbey, with a final candle extinguished at 11pm – the moment Britain’s ultimatum to Germany passed. Children from every state secondary school will travel to the First World War battlefields while streets could be renamed after soldiers awarded the Victoria Cross for bravery under an ambitious £50million package of commemorations. Centrepiece: Westminster Abbey will hold a candlelit vigil to mark exactly 100 years since the outbreak of World War One on August 4 2014 . Lamps: The last candle will be extinguished at 11pm, in an echo of the remark by Foreign Secretary Viscount Edward Grey, who said on the outbreak of war: 'The lamps are going out all over Europe; we shall not see them lit again in our time' Detailed plans for events to be held on 4 August 2014 were unveiled today to mark the precise moment Britain went to war with Germany. At Westminster Abbey a ‘candle-lit . vigil of prayer and solemn reflection’ will finish with the last candle . being extinguished at 11pm. It will echo the famous remark . attributed to then Foreign Secretary, Viscount Edward Grey, who said: . 'The lamps are going out all over Europe; we shall not see them lit . again in our time.' Culture Secretary Maria Miller said: ‘On 4 August 1914 we entered the war - a war like no other the world had seen. Badge: This special First World War Centenary logo will be used by individuals, organisations, companies and charities to mark their own centenary events . ‘It is right we remember and mark the centenary of this momentous day in the world’s history, bringing its importance alive for younger generations and remembering the price that was paid by all involved.’ The Government hopes the vigil will be replicated by churches, faith groups and community organisations across the country. A service will also be held at Glasgow . Cathedral for Commonwealth leaders on the day after the closing . ceremony for the Commonwealth Games. It is expected to recognise the contribution and sacrifices made by soldiers from across the former British Empire. On . the same day an event at the St Symphorien Military Cemetery in Mons, . Belgium will bring together British and German politicians and armed . forces for a service of ‘reconciliation’. The . cemetery is close to where some of the battles took place and the first . and last Commonwealth casualties of the war are believed to be among . the 164 men buried there. Remembrance: A service will be held at St Symphorien Military Cemetery in Mons, Belgium, close to where some of the early action of the war took place . Reconciliation: The cemetery has an equal number of British and German soldiers . In a major speech in November setting out his ambitions for the centenary, David Cameron revealed two pupils and a teacher from every state secondary school will be given the chance to visit the great  battlefields, such as the Somme, Verdun and Fromelles, and take part in remembrance ceremonies on the Western Front. The trips will start in spring 2014 and run until March 2019. They will learn about the war and report back to their classmates on the experience. The £5.3million project will be run by the Institute of Education and STS School Travel Service, it was announced today. He said he hoped for a 'truly national . commemoration worthy of this historic centenary' which, like the events . held to mark the Diamond Jubilee this year, 'says something about who we . are as a people'. The . Prime Minister added: 'Whether . it’s a series of friendly football matches to mark the 1914 Christmas . Day Truce, or the campaign by the Greenhithe branch of the Royal British . Legion to sow the Western Front’s iconic poppies here in the UK, let’s . get out there and make this centenary a truly national moment in every . community in our land. 'The Centenary will also . provide the foundations upon which to build an enduring cultural and . educational legacy to put young people front and centre in our . commemoration and to ensure that the sacrifice and service of 100 years . ago is still remembered in 100 years time.' Psyche: David Cameron said in a speech at the Imperial War Museum last year that the First World War's place in the national consciousness meant it had to be commemorated properly . Visit: The Prime Minister, pictured with schoolchildren in front of a Sopwith Camel by-plane, announced pupils from every secondary school will visit the battlefields . Always honour: the Thiepval Monument in France which honours 72,000 British and South African servicemen who fell at the Battle of the Somme . Education Secretary Michael Gove said: ‘The First World War touched every village and town in Britain. ‘Millions served and almost 900,000 United Kingdom subjects died in action. The loss to this country and to countless families was unimaginable and must not be forgotten. ‘That is why it is important that a new generation should be encouraged to remember the sacrifice of so many.’ Communities Secretary Eric Pickles added: ‘Remembering the huge losses of people and sacrifices made across the Commonwealth during the First World War is something that will unite the whole country next year. ‘It is vitally important that we talk to all communities about this period in history as we mark the centenary. ‘We have a duty to educate future generations about the First World War to ensure that the role our Armed Forces played, and continue to play, in defending the liberties we take for granted today are remembered.’ More than a million Britons died in the First World War. The Battle of the Somme was one of the most deadly in the four year conflict. Here a party of Royal Irish Rifles is pictured in a communication trench on the first day of the Battle of the Somme . Personal accounts of life on the frontline are likely to feature heavily in the commemorations, most notably from the Battle of the Somme, the bloodiest day in the history of the British army . Education: Culture Secretary Maria Miller and Education Secretary Michale Gove said it was important that a generation of school pupils got to visit the battlefields to learn about the Great War . The four-year, £50million programme includes a £35million refurbishment of the World War One galleries at the Imperial War Museum, to open in 2014. It is part-funded by £5million from the Treasury raised fines imposed on banks for financial misconduct. HMS Caroline, the last surviving warship from the conflict, will have a secure future in Belfast thanks to a grant of up to £1million from the National Heritage Memorial Fund. A programme of cultural events, costing £10million, is to be overseen by Jenny Waldman, who was Creative Producer for the London 2012 Festival. It will be focused on three main periods: August 2014, July 2016 and Autumn 2018. Commemorations marking the centenary of  the First World War will last five years and cost £50million.

Pressure: Tim Yeo denied breaking Commons rules by discussing a committee appearance with a business client . Senior Tory MP Tim Yeo has quit his chairmanship of the Commons Energy and Climate Change Committee after he was plunged into a sleaze scandal. In a statement released last night, Mr Yeo said that he would tell committee colleagues that he wanted to ‘temporarily stand aside’ while the Parliamentary standards commissioner investigated him. The Suffolk South MP was caught by undercover newspaper reporters apparently boasting that he had helped coach an industry contact with whom he had a business connection on how to perform before his committee. He denies any wrongdoing and insists he rejected reporters’ offers of £7,000 a day fees in exchange for lobbying for them. Mr Yeo referred himself to the commissioner in an attempt to clear his name. Today the committee 'unanimously accepted' Mr Yeo's recommendation that he 'absent himself from Committee business for the duration of the investigation of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, following his self-referral at the weekend'. In a statement it added: 'The Committee expressed confidence in Mr Yeo's chairmanship of the Committee, but accepted the recommendation in order to ensure the continued effective and evidence-based work of the Committee.' Mr Yeo will not claim his £14,728 salary as a committee chairman while he is being investigated. Lib Dem MP Sir Robert Smith will act as interim chairman. However, Sir Robert has declared having shares in oil firm Shell and last year received a donation from BP International. Mr Yeo stepped aside after senior Labour figures piled pressure on him to quit. Chris Bryant, a Labour home office spokesman, tweeted: ‘How can Tim Yeo possibly remain chair of a committee after [the Sunday Times] story and when he has direct financial interests?’ Mr Yeo’s interests in the green industry are believed to top £1million. In his statement, Mr Yeo said: ‘I am [standing aside] solely to ensure the smooth running of the Committee during the next few weeks. ‘I firmly believe that I have not breached the MPs’ code of conduct in any respect and therefore await the outcome of the Commissioner’s investigation with confidence. ‘In particular I absolutely and unreservedly deny the allegation that I coached a witness with whom I have a business connection before that person gave evidence to the Committee. 'I do not wish the Commissioner's investigation to be a distraction from the Committee's important work. I believe that during the past three years the committee has been extremely effective and I want this to continue.' Undercover reporters posed as representatives of a green energy firm looking to hire Mr Yeo and filmed their conversation . Mr Yeo has been under pressure to . resign from the committee after a newspaper investigation appeared to . show him claiming he could exert influence behind the scenes for private . companies. He was filmed . apparently bragging that he had privately coached the director of the . firm – to which he has financial links – on how to influence the . committee. In . reality, he was speaking to undercover reporters posing as . representatives of a green energy firm looking to hire him on a salary . of £7,000 a day. Mr Yeo said he could introduce them . to ‘really all the key players in the UK Government’, and guide them on . how to give evidence to his own committee of MPs. The . MP, who served as an environment minister in John Major’s government, . has earned about £400,000 from consulting work for various green . companies. In the video he appeared to suggest that he had coached a client, John Smith, managing director of GB Rail Freight, on how to influence the committee - a meeting at which he excused himself asking questions because of the conflict of interest. 'I was able to tell him in advance what he should say,' he said. But Mr Yeo denied any wrong doing earlier today. He told BBC Radio Wales: 'What happened was I travelled with the person concerned in the company of two other people five days before his appearance before the committee in a train. 'During that conversation I spoke very briefly to him about his forthcoming appearance in front of the committee, so I could explain to him that because of the business connection between us - which, of course, was properly declared and registered - I wouldn’t take part in questioning. 'I did not do so, I did not coach John Smith as the paper alleges, he’s not a paying client as the paper alleges, and like many business executives giving evidence to select committees, he actually sought advice from the public affairs company which his company retains for that purpose.' MPs and campaigners said the footage was ‘damning’ and called for him to stand down. Westminster has been embroiled in a scandal this week about MPs and peers handing lobbyists more than 200 Parliamentary passes despite mounting concern about their influence . Mr Yeo, whose committee scrutinises . new energy laws, was recorded at a restaurant by Sunday Times reporters . posing as representatives of a solar energy firm who asked for his help. He would have to . declare such an interest, and was filmed saying he could not speak out . for them in the House of Commons because ‘people will say he’s saying . this because of his commercial interest’. However, he reportedly assured them: ‘What I say to people in private is another matter altogether.’ The MP for South Suffolk has taken various paid roles at green firms since taking over the chairmanship of the committee in 2010. He also has shares and options worth about £583,000 in low-carbon firms that have employed him. The House of Commons code of conduct prohibits members from acting as paid advocates. 'I intend to contest these allegations very vigorously indeed.' Tim Yeo MP . He is the latest politician to be . implicated in the ‘Westminster for sale’ scandal by the Sunday Times. It . was revealed last week that three peers had agreed to ask parliamentary . questions and lobby ministers for paying clients. Lords Mackenzie, . Cunningham and Laird all deny the claims. Tory MP Margot James wrote on Twitter that the allegations were ‘damning’. She said ‘paid consultancy and directorships relevant to committee work surely incompatible with chairing [a] committee’. Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Tim Yeo appears to have been caught red-handed in a disgusting attempt to bend the rules. ‘Mr Yeo should resign but, more importantly, the Government should reconsider its disastrous energy policies that reward this sort of behaviour.’ Mr Yeo apparently told the reporters he could commit to at least one day a month, despite already holding four private jobs and negotiating to take a further two. He said: ‘If you want to meet the right people, I can facilitate all those introductions and I can use the knowledge I get from what is quite an active network of connections.’ Mr Yeo has referred himself to the Commons standards commissioner for the allegations to be investigated, and said he ‘totally rejects’ the claims. He said: ‘The Sunday Times has chosen to quote very selectively from a recording obtained clandestinely during a conversation of nearly an hour and a half in a restaurant with two undercover reporters who purported to be representing a client from South Korea. My lawyer requested the whole recording from which these extracts were obtained but this has not been given. He said it was ‘totally untrue’ that he had coached Mr Smith. Labour MP John Mann said: ‘He has referred himself for investigation, clearly he has to stand down while that goes on.'","Mr Yeo filmed appearing to say he previously coached a paying client .

Killer: A handwritten suicide note was found on the body of John Zawahri, 23, after he killed five people in Santa Monica last week . A gunman who shot and killed five people last week in Santa Monica left a three-page suicide note apologising for murdering his father and brother. Detectives revealed the letter was found on  the body of John Zawahri after he was shot dead by police following the rampage last Friday. It also emerged the assault-style . rifle carried by the 23-year-old had been assembled out of component . parts he ordered from out of state. Investigators are seeking to . determine whether Zawahri, who had tried but failed to buy a weapon in . 2011, assembled the gun himself or had someone else do it for him. The handwritten suicide note apologised for killing his father and older brother, who . were found shot to death in their home by firefighters called to put out . a fire that engulfed part of the house. Santa Monica police spokesman Sergeant Richard Lewis said the note also bid . goodbye to friends and expressed hope that his mother, who was estranged . from Zawahri's father and was out of the country at the time of the . killings, would be provided for financially. But the . letter offered no explanation for why Zawahri killed his father and . brother or went on the subsequent shooting spree through the seaside . town west of Los Angeles that left three other people dead at Santa . Monica College. 'It was a farewell letter, basically, apologizing . for what he did to his brother and his dad, and hoping that his mother . would be taken care of. That's it,' Lewis said. He made no . mention in the letter of marital strife known to have existed between . his parents or any other problems, nor did he express any anger, Lewis . said. Police also revealed the former . part-time college student had also converted a vintage .44-caliber . black-powder handgun into a .45-caliber revolver that he carried with . him last week. Shooting: This photo shows an assault rifle used during the 23-year-old's shooting rampage . Weapon: This Colt 45 was also seized by police officers who killed John Zawahri after he shot five people dead . Murder: This Colt pistol was another of the weapons seized by detectives . Police added that Zawahri had tried to purchase a weapon in 2011 but was denied permission by the California Department of Justice in a form letter recovered after last week's shootings. Police have yet to determine why Zawahri was denied the purchase or what kind of gun he had tried to acquire. Even though the semi-automatic rifle wielded by Zawahri was assembled from component parts, it was illegal under California's strict gun laws. Terrifying: Surveillance footage clearly shows a man entering the Santa Monica College library holding an automatic rifle . Fateful moment: This handout provided by the Santa Monica Police Department, shows a suspected mass shooting gunman entering the Santa Monica College library with his AR-15 circled in red . Shot dead: The body of John Zawahri, who was killed during a confrontation with police Friday . Killer: This map shows the locations where John Zawahri went on his rampage around Santa Monica . California has banned the purchase and . possession of assault-style weapons unless they were acquired by the . owner before June 1989. Santa Monica Police Chief Jacqueline Seabrooks, in a news conference called by police to disclose new details of the investigation, also said investigators believe mental illness was a factor in Zawahri's outburst of gun violence. Police previously have cited an encounter they say Zawahri had with law enforcement as a juvenile in which he was taken into custody and placed under a 72-hour 'psychiatric hold' in 2006, when he would have been 16 or 17 years old..

Thousands of dead starfish have washed up on a beach in Lincolnshire after a period of stormy weather. Shocked photographer Simon Peck estimates that 4,000 starfish - along with whelks' eggs and pieces of shell - had surfaced on Cleethorpes beach. Experts think that the animals were dislodged by rough waters in the recent wintry weather, with a similar incident happening at the same time last year. Puzzle: Photographer Simon Peck was shocked to find around 4,000 starfish and bits of shell on the beach . Wetlands: Whelks' eggs also appeared at Cleethorpes beach. In the past, sea potatoes have washed up . Poignant: It's thought that rough seas dislodged the sea creatures at a sandy part of the coastline . Mass starfish strandings, known as ‘wrecks’, are not uncommon in Britain and typically occur once or twice a year as a result of storms. Most starfish travel alone or in small groups, but congregate in their millions if a particular area of the seabed is rich in food or to reproduce. Despite its name, the starfish is not a fish but an echinoderm and holds on to the ocean floor using their suction-cupped tube feet underneath their limbs. Wreck: Mass stranding in Devon in 2010 . They are therefore vulnerable during bad weather at sea as storms send strong currents through the beds where they are feeding, plucking them off their prey. The currents then carry them to the shore, and dump them on the beach. Although tides and strong currents are . the most likely cause of this recent mass stranding, in a similar . incident in Japan last year, starvation was to blame. When hundreds of starfish stranded in southern Japan scientists said lack of food had made them too weak to hold on to the ocean floor. Due to environmental hazards and overfishing of mussels, starfish are . moving closer to the shore, becoming more vulnerable to tide and . currents. Richard Harrington, communications . manager at the Marine Conservation Society, said: 'These are all common starfish Asterias . rubens. 'The fact that there's what appear to be whelk eggs and different . shells in these pictures, both shallow water residents, along with the . common starfish, would back up the likelihood that it is simply stormy . weather that has caused this big strand. 'We were aware of a strand like this in the region at this time last year, too. 'Mass strandings of . starfish and sea potatoes, a kind of sand-dwelling sea urchin, happen . quite regularly in different parts of the coast. 'They seem to occur most in winter, and . around sandy areas, when it's likely that rough seas in shallow water . dislodge them in large numbers. 'Strandings . like this may be associated with breeding, indicated if all of the . specimens that washed up are mature adults, but the common starfish . tends to aggregate and spawn most in spring and summer - so that is . unlikely.' Millions of common starfish live in . British seas. About the size of a hand, they are pinky orange when . alive, but turn a bright orange when dry. Their . ideal feeding ground is a mussel bed, where millions of starfish will . congregate at any one time. And it's here where they are most at risk. Violent . storms can send terrifically strong currents through the mussel beds . where they are feeding, pluck them off their prey, carry them to the . shore and dump thousands at a time on to a beach. In . the past, some mass strandings have been blamed on overfishing - with . dredgers used to scrape the sea floor for mussels dislodging starfish or . covering them with mud and sand. Coastal confusion: Similar 'mass strandings' have happened in the past - mostly in winter, around sandy areas . Strange: A similar stranding was seen last year. Sometimes they happen in Spring during breeding season .","Whelk eggs and shells were also washed ashore at Cleethorpes .

The man whose car was hijacked by the Boston marathon bombers broke his silence in his first televised interview on Tuesday. Danny, a 26-year-old Chinese entrepreneur, reveals his harrowing encounter when he life hung in the balance in his nearly two hour drive with Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarneav. The man, who is keeping his identify concealed and had his voice altered for the on-air interview, downplayed his brave reaction and said he only though about 'trying to save myself.' Scroll down for video. Speaking out: The man who was hijacked 'Danny,' pictured, wishes to conceal his true identity and had his face concealed and his voice altered for his Tuesday interview with CBS News . Suspects: Dzhokhar, left, and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, right, hijacked the driver's car in Boston on the evening of April 18 (the brothers pictured on April 15 just moments before the Marathon blast . The driver says he had pulled his car over to the side of the road to text when Tamerlan Tsarnaev approached his Mercedes at 11pm on April 18. The 26-year-old jumped in his car. 'I thought it was just a robbery, you . know?' Danny told CBS. 'He took out his gun, pointed to me. He told me that ""You now I am serious. Don't be stupid.""' 'He asked me a question, like, ""Do you . know the Boston explosion on Monday?"" I said, ""yes."" He said, you know, ""I did that. And I just killed a policeman in Cambridge.""' To begin with Danny was driving his car with Tamerlan in the passenger seat beside him, while Dzhokhar following behind in a sedan. Later the brother’s moved all the gear into Danny’s car and Tamerlan drove. The late-night drive lasted an hour and a half. Frightening: The driver of the car Tamerlan Tsarnaev (left) and Dzhokhar (right) spoke mainly in Russian but then switched to English when they asked the man, Danny, about getting to New York . Both brothers primarily spoke in Russian during the drive but Danny says that at one point they began to inquire about New York City. 'I only heard one word. It's Manhattan. It seemed like they were going to New York because they asked me a lot of questions,' he said. Officials in New York confirmed the brothers had decided, after the FBI released photos of them on April 18, to drive to Manhattan and detonate more explosives in Times Square. The plan was confirmed by law enforcement officials who have been interviewing the surviving suspect, 19-year-old Dzhokhar, in the aftermath of his capture on April 19. During the terrifying experience, the driver said that his roommate became worried about him because he wasn't home yet and called Danny on his cell phone. Danny told the men, 'if you don't want me to pick up the phone, I won't pick it up. I won't say anything.' Tamerlan responded 'you have to answer the phone. But if you use any single world in Chinese, I will kill you,' the man remembers. 'I just told him I'm going to sleep over at a friend's place tonight,' Danny said. 'So after, I hang up the phone. Tamerlan was very happy. He said, ""Good job. Good boy.""' Escape: The two bombing suspects pulled up at the Shell gas station to use a stolen ATM card from their hostage Danny. He managed to escape to the Mobil gas station across the street and call for help (right) During the drive, Danny now reveals how he began to plan an escape. He began plotting his exit, thinking through the steps of unlocking his door, unfastening his seat belt and pulling the handle of the door to open it. The car ran out of gas so the trio had to stop at a gas station. At that moment, he seized the opportunity to leave when Dzhokhar left the car to pay for the gasoline and Tamerlan was distracted as he tried to work the GPS. 'I was counting. I was counting. I was just, ""one two, three, four."" And I just do it. And I did it. I can feel Tamerlan trying to grab me ... I was just running as fast as I can and I never look back.' He escaped across the street to the Mobil gas station and begged the clerk on duty to call police. Hours later, the brothers were tracked by police and a shoot out began in a quiet neighborhood in Watertown, Mass. His Mercedes SUV sustained 32 bullet holes during the gunfire. Looking back, Danny thanks the brave law enforcement officers who worked tirelessly to track down the suspects. 'The police, they are the hero. They exchange gunfire with the bad guys. I think they are the heroes,' he said. During the ferocious gunbattle ensued, the older brother Tamerlan, 26, was killed but 19-year-old Dzhokhar managed to escape. The entire city of Boston was on lockdown on April 19 while police frantically searched for Dzhokhar. He was found that Friday evening, hiding under a tarp in a boat in the backyard of a home in Watertown.","Terrifying ordeal at hands of bombers is revealed on TV for the first time .

Now food artist, Sarah Hardy, has turned her attention to creating sweet treats that look like scarily lifelike bugs. The sweets, which were inspired by Hardy's passion for natural history, includes a leech, a garden snail, a warty toad, a newt, fossils and an endangered beetle - all of which are made from chocolate. The bizarre sweets, which will go on sale at Selfridges from September, will appeal to children with a penchant for creepie crawlies as well as natural history lovers, say Hardy and her business partner, Chris Verraes. Realistic: This snail (and its cabbage leaf) might look lifelike but they're actually made from chocolate .

Sarah said: 'We are following our passions and this has led to us wanting to create a fun, family friendly business. 'We are artists with a love of . natural history and a background in luxury confections. So obviously we . had to make Boy Eats Bug happen!' Although the pair are self-taught chocolatiers, they say their background in cake making, sculpting and crafting backgrounds gave them all the skills they needed, along with a mutual love of the natural world. 'We can hopefully all remember what it was like to be a child, discovering something for the first time,' added Chris, . ‘The wonder and excitement of being confronted by something amazing - something strangely beautiful like a frog or a dragonfly or a dinosaur.' Christmas dinner: Sarah's amazingly realistic 'raw turkey' was actually an orange drizzle cake . Tasty: Once the 'turkey' was sliced into, its sweet secret was revealed - much to the Hardy family's relief . In December last year Sarah made a turkey cake so realistic it was almost impossible to distinguish it from a real raw turkey. The baker spent three days working on her realistic cake, which was served on a foil tray and even featured a piece of string holding the turkey 'legs' together. 'I just made it as a one-off to freak out my family,' said Sarah, who worked in secret at night to ensure her creation was a complete surprise on Christmas Day. 'The most unappealing thing I could think of to give them was raw meat. They're used to me doing beautiful things like wedding cakes, so this was something different. 'Nobody actually believed it was a cake until we sliced into it. When we did everyone stood up and I realised they were all crowding around to take pictures.' Although Hardy said she hopes to create more 'turkeys', for now she and Verraes are working on an installation called 'Darwin's Parlour', which will form part of the Appetite Food Festival in East London this month.","The chocolate insects are the creation of Sarah Hardy and Chris Verraes .

Iran today vowed down to track down the filmmaker who produced an anti-Islamic film which has provoked protests around the world. As fresh protests broke out in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the Iranian Vice-President Mohammad Reza Rahimi issued an stark message directed at Nakoula Basseley Nakoula - who lives in California - who was behind The Innocence of Muslims. 'The government of the Islamic Republic of Iran condemns... this inappropriate and offensive action,' Mr Rahimi said. 'Certainly it will search for, track and pursue this guilty person who... has insulted 1.5billion Muslims worldwide.' Anger: Protesters in Pakistan torch a US flag during a demonstration against the anti-Islam film The Innocence of Islam in the city of Lahore . Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei also issued a statement, calling on the West to show it respects Islam by blocking the film. They must prove they were not 'accomplices' in a 'big crime', he said. The comments came on the day that: . The demonstrations were the latest across the world ignited by a short film made with private funds in the US and posted on the Internet that depicted the Prophet Mohammad as a fool, a womaniser and a homosexual. The situation saddles U.S. President Barack Obama with an unexpected foreign policy headache as he campaigns for re-election in November, even though his administration has condemned the film as reprehensible and disgusting. Condemnation: Iranian Vice-President Mohammad Reza Rahimi (left) called for the makers of the film to be punished while the country's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (right) demanded the West take action . In a torrent of violence last week, the US ambassador to Libya and three other Americans were killed in an attack in Benghazi and US and other foreign embassies were stormed in cities in Asia, Africa and the Middle East by furious Muslims. At least nine other people have been killed. Washington has sent ships, extra troops and special forces to protect U.S. interests and citizens in the Middle East, while a number of its embassies have evacuated staff and are on high alert for trouble. A White House spokesman said Obama spoke by telephone to senior diplomats at the weekend to reassure them of his support. 'He called the chiefs of mission in Sudan, Tunisia, Libya and Yemen to let those diplomats know that he was thinking about them, that their safety remains a top priority of his, and it is something he will remain focused on,' spokesman Josh Earnest said. Despite Obama's efforts early in his tenure to improve relations with the Arab and Muslim world, the new violence adds to a host of problems including the continued U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan, Iran's nuclear programme, the Syrian civil war and the fall-out from the Arab Spring revolts. Earlier the leader of the militatn group Hezbollah Sheik Hassan Nasrallah called for protests against the movie and said the US must be held accountable for the film. Fury of the mob: Hundreds of protesters - some of them very young - targeted American base Camp Phoenix in Kabul shouting 'Death to America' Strong tactics: Dozens of Afghan policemen were deployed in an attempt to restore order . 'Those who should be held accountable, punished, prosecuted and boycotted are those directly responsible for this film and those who stand behind them and those who support and protect them, primarily the United States of America,' Mr Nasrallah said. He called for protests on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday, urging protesters to call on their leaders to express their anger too. 'We should not only express our anger at an American embassy here or there. We should tell our rulers in the Arab and Muslim world that it is ""your responsibility in the first place"" and since you officially represent the governments and states of the Muslim world you should impose on the United States, Europe and the whole world that our prophet, our Quran and our holy places and honor of our Prophet be respected,' he said. A 14-minute excerpt of the film, which . is both in English and dubbed into Arabic, has been available on . YouTube, although some countries have cut access to the site. The . violence began Tuesday when mainly Islamist protesters climbed the U.S. Embassy walls in the Egyptian capital of Cairo and tore down the . American flag from a pole in the courtyard. Chris . Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to Libya, also was killed Tuesday along . with three other Americans, as violent protesters stormed the consulate . in Benghazi.

President's response was echoed by former Prime Minister Tony Blair, . who called into BBC's Radio 4 Monday morning to discuss the continued . violence. Mr Blair, now . Middle East envoy for the Quartet of powers, said: 'The film, it may be . wrong and offensive but it is also laughable as a piece of film-making. 'What I am afraid is very dangerous and actually is wrong is the reaction to it.' Mr . Blair said such problems were an inevitable consequence of the Arab . Spring that has overthrown repressive regimes in Libya and elsewhere. 'I . just see a region that is in the process of huge transition. There is . essentially a struggle between the forces of modernisation, who want an . open society, a properly functioning economy, who recognise the 21st . century is the 21st century, and then those of reaction based on a . perverted view of religion, that want to pull the whole thing . backwards,' he said. 'When . you lift the lid off the repression what comes out are a whole lot of . religious, ethnic, tribal influences that themselves have to be . countered and moulded into something that is compatible with the modern . world.' Rally: Hundreds of protesters clad in white hurled petrol bombs outside the US Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia . Ugly scenes: American flags were also burned in the streets as police fired tear gas in a bid to disperse the crowds . Out of control: The protests were the first in Indonesia since a firestorm of protests had spread across the Muslim world . Mr Blair said he had changed his view since his time in Number 10, when he used to avoid discussions about faith. 'What . the politicians often want to do - for totally understandable reasons, I . used to feel this myself - is religion is such a tricky subject for us . that we want to stay away from it,' he said. 'But one element of resolving this is about a view of religion that is also open-minded and pluralistic. 'And . what you actually require for democracy to function properly is a view . of democracy in which religion has its place but where you have . democracy-friendly religion as well as religion-friendly democracy.' He . added: 'In the end we need both the leadership within those countries . and within Islam to stand up and say ‘look, there is a proper modern way . of reconciling religious faith, democracy in society’, and we need . ourselves from the outside to engage with this process of change in a . way that’s constructive.'","Middle East rocked by fresh wave of protests at controversial movie .

Scouse girls typically need at least two make-up wipes to remove their war paint every day, or 730 over the course of a year, the research found. The poll found 45 per cent of girls from Liverpool have regularly gone to bed with a full face of make-up and a third of those have kept it on for the next day after a quick touch-up. Girls from London and Newcastle were more likely to don false eyelashes and Manchester females wear the most fake tan. The study also revealed more than one third of those polled said northerners were most likely to wear more make-up. By contrast, girls from Plymouth, Norwich and Oxford we more likely to opt for a simple, classic look. Wipe it off: Scouse girls typically need at least two make-up wipes to remove their war paint every day and it's women from Swansea, like Catherine Zeta Jones, who are most concerned about their skin . The poll also found women from the Welsh city of Swansea were the most worried about the amount of make-up they wear and the effect it has on their skin. Celebrity make-up artist Caroline Frazer said: 'Make-up trends come and go just as they do with fashion or hairstyles. 'Some seasons the subtle, natural look is favoured, but on other occasions a more heavy, dramatic look like this season's red lips, fuller lashes and bright eye shadows. 'There is nothing wrong with wearing make-up, as long as it is removed properly to ensure it doesn't block pores or make skin look dull and lack luster. It's equally important to create the right canvas so make-up looks its best which some women forget. 'Great make-up isn't just about applying it well; it's also about looking after your skin so a healthier complexion shines through. Concerned: The study also found 25 per cent of all women worry about the amount of make-up they wear and believe they could be suffocating their skin . 'We are all guilty of occasionally going to bed with make-up still on, but it's really important not to do this regularly as it will take its toll on the skin.' The study also found 25 per cent of all women worry about the amount of make-up they wear and believe they could be suffocating their skin. To try and counteract this three quarters of women like to have a break at least once a week from wearing make-up. Of the women polled by skincare brand Simple, more than half said that women who wear a lot of make-up are trying too hard and 34 per cent said they are hiding who they really are. In contrast more than one in 20 felt they should wear more make-up to get ahead in their career. Which is probably the reason why eight in ten women insist on applying make-up before they head to the office. Half of women said they look 100 times better after they have applied make-up and 56 per cent said just a touch of make-up covers any blemishes. Caroline Frazer added: 'It's encouraging that women give their skin a bit of a break from make-up. 'Whilst make-up will create a cover for blemishes it won't help skin in the long run, especially if you are prone to problem or sensitive skin. Name and shame: The poll named and shamed glamour girl Katie Price as having the worst make-up and Harry Potter starlet Emma Watson as the best . 'There is no excuse to not look after your skin, it's your insurance policy for the future - you only have one skin so look after it.' The poll also named and shamed glamour girl Katie Price as having the worst make-up and Harry Potter starlet Emma Watson as the best.","One in ten women in Liverpool adopt a 'nice and thick' approach .

She was a child of 13 walking along a road in her school uniform when she first met ‘friendly’ taxi driver Mohammed Sajid. But that meeting would change her life for ever, leading to her being plied with cheap alcohol and taken to a house in Nelson, Lancashire, and raped. Now, seven years later, she sits alone in a dingy one-bedroom flat, reliving the sickening way she was groomed for sex by an older man she trusted. Haunted by her past: One of the victims of the sex grooming gang (left) has spoken about her abuse at the hands of taxi driver Mohammed Sajid (right) who plied her with booze and raped her when she was just 13 . Now on medication for depression and suffering from panic attacks, the mother-of-one has little hope that she will ever recover from her  horrendous ordeal. Yesterday, Sajid, 35, was jailed for a total of 12 years for rape, sexual  activity with a child, conspiracy and trafficking. Born in Rochdale, his young victim lived in cramped conditions with her parents, three sisters and four brothers on a run-down council estate. Her father who had worked as a security guard had started experimenting with drugs while she was a toddler and by the time she was in her teens, he was a full-time heroin addict. In order to escape her home life, she followed in her older sisters’ footsteps and began ‘going with’ Asian men and ‘jumping’ into their cars. Evil: Eight of the nine gang members, including Sajid (top row, second right), who were jailed for a total of 77 years yesterday for preying on a string of young girls . She said: ‘I was young and stupid and I just followed my sister and got involved with this guy. ‘I didn’t really know what I was doing. I was just a kid and I would have agreed to anything. ‘I totally got in with the wrong crowd and I was taken advantage of.’ At the age of 13 she would meet the Asian taxi driver who would end up raping her and subjecting her to years of abuse. Recalling the moment they met, she said she was still in her school uniform walking down a street near her home when he told her to get in to his car so that they could ‘chill’ together. ‘He thought I was my sister because we looked very similar. But even when he realised I was her younger sister he still asked me if I wanted to chill with him and he told me to get into the car. Sickening: Sajid (front) has been jailed for 12 years after subjecting his victim to years of abuse . ‘He handed me this plastic bottle which was full of Boost and vodka and I just started drinking it because I didn’t know any better. ‘We were driving for quite a long time and were just chatting about random stuff and then before I knew what was happening we arrived in this street with blocks of terraced houses. ‘It was just a normal house with furniture and it looked like someone lived there. ‘It had a couch, telly, fires, beds, wardrobes.  He said he was living there because he was working in a cash and carry in Nelson. ‘I carried on drinking from the bottle and we just sat in the living room for a bit. But then I just remember feeling really drunk and he started touching me and then told me to go upstairs. ‘I just did as I was told because I was a kid and we went into the bedroom and we slept together. ‘I was totally out of my head and can’t really remember much. I don’t really want to remember and have blocked most of it out. ‘Afterwards, as if everything was normal I just got dressed and he told me to get back in the car and then he dropped me back off at home and we didn’t talk about what had just happened and I didn’t tell anyone.’ But the nightmare for the youngster was not about to end. She was forced to continue to have contact with the taxi driver for most of her teenage life. She said her father would send her round to the taxi driver’s house to beg for money in order to sustain his drugs habit. She said: ‘My father was on smack and he knew that if I went round to Saj’s house and sat with him he would give me money. ‘So dad would send me round all the time and I just did as I was told. ‘Saj would ask me to sit near to him and then he would grope and touch me and at the time it just felt quite risky because I was young and didn’t realise exactly what was going on. ‘I would try and move out of the way but he would want me to sit close to him and I remember just thinking I needed to do it to get the money for my dad so he could go and buy his drugs. ‘I shouldn’t have let him do that and it makes me think that I got into the wrong crowd when I was younger. ‘I try and block it out because I can’t bear to think about it. He is a dirty old man and I was young and stupid. ‘I feel like he took advantage of me because I didn’t know any better – I was just a child.’ The abuse carried on until last year when the woman was contacted by the police after they found her number on Mohammed Sajid’s mobile phone. ‘I had no idea that I was part of something so disgusting. It makes me feel sick now. ‘There are more girls out there who they did the same to, but half of them are too scared to come forward and tell people that they have been abused.’ Relieved: A 19-year-old (not pictured) has told of her lucky escape from the sex grooming gang and how she provided information that led to the conviction of the men . ‘I feel incredibly lucky that I managed to escape from them,’ said the 19-year-old who came close to becoming a sex grooming victim. The teenager was able to provide police with evidence which would lead to the conviction of the men. Her background is similar to many of the young girls involved in the case. She grew up on a council estate and her parents’ marriage broke down whilst she was in primary school. She is a teenage mother and is also a full-time carer for her disabled father. When she was at high school she became involved with the ‘Rochdale girls’ – a group of teenagers as young as 12 who would ‘hang around’ with Asian men. She said: ‘There was an older girl who was in a relationship with one of the Asian men and our group of girls would go with her to the Tasty Bites takeaway in Heywood. ‘At first we did not go into the back of the takeaway,  we would just sit in the front and have a can of Coke and talk. But then the older girl, who has got a bit of a reputation for being a hard nut and a bully, started threatening some of the younger ones about going in the back with the men.’ The young mother was 15 when she first went into the takeaway with a friend.  ‘At first we sat downstairs and then this guy who we all called “Daddy” told us to go upstairs into the back room because he didn’t want us to disturb the customers. ‘There were two dirty mattresses on the floor and a table and two chairs with some blinds. You could tell they were using it for something bad because there were empty plastic packets which looked like they had cocaine in them on the floor. ‘I went up for five minutes and when I saw all this I just thought I need to get out of here. I didn’t feel comfortable at all so I left. Some of the girls came with me but others stayed. ‘And some girls started going all the time. When they came to school they would brag that they got free food, beer and drugs and used to tell us what they did. It was disgusting.’ The teenager said the men would do  anything to get the young girls into the back room and even spiked their drinks. And she said they would regularly grope the girls as they sat at the front counter in the takeaway. She said the girls would get harassed  by the gang as they walked through the town centre. She said: ‘Daddy would randomly walk the streets and he would stop the girls and then talk to them. He was really scary.’ The youngster is disgusted that the gang described the girls as prostitutes in court and said she is still struggling to move on with her life. She said: ‘The girls were doing it because they were scared and they were too young to know any better.’","Girl met Mohammed Sajid on way to school when she was 13 years old .

"By . Sophie Borland . UPDATED: . 18:45 EST, 3 February 2012 . The professional body  representing GPs has demanded the Government scrap its NHS reforms, warning that they will cause ‘irreparable damage’ to patient care. Members of the Royal College of General Practitioners have written to the Prime Minister declaring their outright opposition to the plans. It will be seen as a major setback for the Government as GPs are meant to be the main beneficiaries of the controversial reforms, which would hand them direct control over NHS services and budgets in their local area. The College has written to David Cameron (pictured washing his hands at the Royal Salford Hospital in Manchester) asking the Prime Minister to scrap the bill . But in recent weeks, ministers have . faced growing opposition from the medical profession, with the British . Medical Association, the Royal College of Nursing and the Royal College . of Midwives among the groups calling for the reforms to be ditched. Yesterday, RCGP chairman Dr Clare Gerada, who represents 34,000 doctors . in England, told Radio 4’s Today programme that the Health and Social . Care Bill would ‘turn the National Health Service into thousands of . different health services, all competing for the same patients, the same . knee, the same brain, the same heart. Dr Clare Gerada said their concerns from 18 months ago had still not been addressed . ‘Patients will find their care fragmented, it will be on different . sites, it won’t join up, it will be  difficult to hand over care and it . will be phenomenally expensive to keep track of all these competing . parts of the NHS.’ She added: ‘We cannot sit back. We must raise our concerns in the hope . that the Prime Minister will halt this damaging, unnecessary and . expensive reorganisation which, in our view, risks leaving the poorest . and most vulnerable in society to bear the brunt.’ The Bill, which does not affect Wales or Scotland, is now going through . the House of Lords and  hinges on abolishing large primary care trusts . and giving GPs control of NHS budgets to let them decide which . treatments and services will be provided within their area. Earlier this week, Health Secretary Andrew Lansley made 137 amendments . to the Bill in the hope of appeasing members of the House of Lords, who . are due to debate it further next week. Health Minister Simon Burns said: ‘It is disappointing that Clare Gerada . has taken this step, but it hardly comes as a surprise given her . outspoken opposition to our plans to improve the NHS. Any reform causes . controversy and there is always going to be disagreement about the best . way to modernise the NHS. ‘But only yesterday the Family Doctor Association, representing over . 1,000 practices in the UK, came out in support for our plans. We have . been carefully listening to the ideas raised as the Bill has progressed . through Parliament, and as a result we tabled a series of amendments to . safeguard the future of the NHS.’ The Bill also sets out to encourage more competition within the NHS in . the hope it will drive up standards, with hospitals, private firms and . charities all vying to treat patients. But from the outset it has been heavily opposed by medical workers, charities and even MPs from within the Government. And yesterday the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy also called for the . Bill to be scrapped, saying that even Mr Lansley’s latest changes did . not address its concerns. Last month, Dr Hamish Meldrum, chairman of the British Medical . Association’s council, warned that if the reforms went ahead the NHS . could face scandals on the scale of those that occurred at Mid . Staffordshire NHS Trust in 2010, when up to 1,200 patients died from . poor care as staff put government targets and cost-cutting ahead of . patient care.

Boone Pickens has been indicted for murder for allegedly injecting the 21-year-old with the heroin that claimed his life. Brennan Trainor Rodriguez, 21, has also been indicted for manslaughter, tampering with evidence and delivering a controlled substance in the January 29 death of Ty Pickens, according to a spokeswoman for Tarrant County prosecutors. The indictment accuses Rodriguez of injecting the drug into Pickens' body, causing his death. Charged: Brennan Trainor Rodriguez, has been indicted for the murder of Thomas 'Ty' Boone Pickens IV . Unspeakable tragedy: Pickens, 21, was a junior at Texas Christian University and died after a suspected 'heroin and Xanax' overdose. He had probably been dead for hours when a friend finally drove him to the hospital . Rodriguez is also accused of hiding drugs and a syringe from law enforcement after Pickens' death. Ty's father, Thomas Boone Pickens III, is the industrialist's youngest son. T. Boone Pickens started his career at Phillips Petroleum before founding Mesa Petroleum in 1956. In a statement, the Pickens family said they welcomed the development in the case. 'We are grateful that the Tarrant County Grand Jury has taken the first step in holding Brennan Rodriguez responsible for his role in the death of Ty Pickens.' 'Ty was not a heroin user or addict and we believe that the justice system will reveal the truth of what happened that unfortunate night.' Rodriguez's attorney, Bruce Ashworth, declined to comment. If convicted he faces between five years and life in prison. In April, the Tarrant County Medical Examiner ruled Thomas Boone Pickens IV or Ty, as he was known, died of acute heroin intoxication. Another student allegedly found the grandson of the wealthy oil and gas titan at Rodriguez's off-campus apartment on the morning of January 29. The unidentified student said he wouldn't wake up and that he had probably been dead for several hours. Pickens was a junior at Texas Christian University where he was majoring in strategic communications. 'Ty¿s loss at such a young age is an unspeakable family tragedy for the entire Pickens family and his many friends,' the family said in a statement. Tycoon: Oil executive Pickens is worth over a billion dollars after starting his career in 1956. He has also been active in national politics . TCU confirmed Rodriguez was also a student at the private university in Fort Worth but have so far declined to comment on the case. 'Because this is a police investigation, all we can do is verify that he is a TCU student,' they said in a statement in March. 'As in all such cases, he has been suspended from the university pending a hearing through the university's disciplinary process.' Ty's grandfather, who has five children and 12 grandchildren, lives in an opulent mansion in the exclusive suburb of Preston Hollow, Dallas where neighbors include former president George W. Bush, many of the Dallas Cowboys and George Michael. Homes can cost as much as $40 million. The wealthy industrialist also owns the Mesa Vista, a property worth around $35million set in 68,000 acres in Roberts County, Texas.

With expenses scandals still fresh in the mind, cash for questions dominating headlines, and first-class perks all paid for by the taxpayer, it is perhaps not surprising that MPs are not held in the highest regard by voters. In fact a major poll has confirmed the image that most MPs are only in politics to line their own pockets, revealing that four in five voters do not trust MPs and believe that they put their own interests before others. The Ipsos MORI survey reveals deep levels of cynicism towards politicians in general, although 51 per cent of respondents said they trusted their local MP. A major poll has confirmed the image that most MPs are only in politics to line their own pockets . Public confidence in elected representatives has been declining in recent years, and is markedly lower than in similar surveys in 2004 and 2006. But it has recovered slightly since its low point in 2009 during the MPs’ expenses scandal, when 76 per cent of those questioned did not trust MPs to tell the truth. Now 72 per cent concur – up from 60 per cent in 2006 – while 21 per cent said they did trust them to be honest. As to what the priorities of MPs are, half of the British public (52 per cent) believe they put their own interests first, and 31 per cent say that they put their party first. Only one in 12 (8 per cent ) believe MPs put the interests of their own constituents first, and 6 per cent said their country comes first for MPs. Half of the British public believe MPs put their own interests first, according to a new Ipsos MORI survey . Unfortunately this is almost the exact opposite of what people want MPs to prioritise, with 56 per cent saying they want them to put their country first while 40 per cent want the constituent put first. Supporters of the UK Independence Party were more likely than other party supporters to think MPs put their own interests first (72 per cent), to not trust MPs in general or their local MP, and were also most dissatisfied with the three main party leaders. Gideon Skinner, head of political research at Ipsos MORI, said: ‘Public cynicism with politics is nothing new, but it looks like it has become entrenched. ‘Disenchantment with politicians is shared across supporters of all parties – but is noticeably higher among UKIP voters, who seem most unhappy with the current political scene.’","The Ipsos MORI survey reveals deep levels of cynicism towards politicians .

The top-ten beer-drinking states in the United States has been revealed - with New Hampshire top of the beer-guzzlers. More than six billion gallons of the golden nectar were sold across all the states in 2011, but there is a huge contrast between each states, with some states, such as Connecticut, seeing as little as 21.8 gallons drank per person in 2011. Meanwhile, in New Hampshire, North Dakota and Montana, more than 40 gallons are drunk per person. For anyone worried that the nation may be drowning in inebriation, they can rest assured that overall consumption is down, with figures from The Beer Institute showing that Americans are drinking an average of 7.5 per cent less beer since 2003. Beer Nation: 43 gallons of beer was consumed in New Hampshire for each resident of the state, while Connecticut was the most sober with just 23 gallons per resident . 10. Delaware9. Nebraska8. Texas7. Vermont6. Wisconsin5. Nevada4. South Dakota3. Montana2. North Dakota1. New Hampshire . Scroll down for more information on each state . Beer-drinking has fallen for the last three years in the U.S. - although it has increased in some states - for instance, it actually increased in Vermont by seven per cent over the last three years. The Beer Institute monitors the sales of beer in each state, and then the publication 24/7 Wall Street extrapolated the average beer intake per person based on population figures. There are some caveats - the figures are based on the number of people living in each state aged over 21. But it does not necessarily take into account each state's unique properties - for instance, New Hampshire's alcohol taxes are about five or six per cent lower than their nearest neighbours. So it is not uncommon for residents from Massachusetts, Vermont, and Maine to cross over the borders to pick up their alcohol intake - inflating New Hampshire's ratings. Other quirks in local legislation also play a role - there are still states which do not allow alcohol sales on a Sunday. Meanwhile, all the states in the Top 10 allow alcohol sales in gas stations and convenience stores, again making casual purchases or purchases from out-of-state visitors easier. Pick your choice: Beer taps in a Georgetown bar . However there does seem to be a correlation between high amounts of beer purchased and the rates of beer drinking. A separate 2011 survey studied beer drinking across the entire U.S., and 24/7 reports that the ten states with the highest number of beer sales were among the top states for binge drinking. Around 18 per cent of New Hampshire residents were classed as binge-drinkers - making them 21st on the list of binge-drinking states. Meanwhile, the second on the list, North Dakota, saw nearly 24 per cent of their residents admit to drinking too much at times. Nebraskans were among the heaviest drinkers in the United States, with nearly 23 per cent classed as binge drinkers, and another 7.5 per cent classed as heavy drinkers. Nearly 62 per cent of adults in the state stated they had consumed alcohol within the past 30 days - one of the highest percentages in the country. 10. Delaware . 10.

Steve King, a right-wing flamethrower from Iowa, were the first two national figures to politicize Monday's Boston massacre. King said in an interview with the conservative National Review magazine that the Senate's immigration reform bill should stop dead in its tracks, reacting to early reports that a Saudi suspect in the U.S. on a student visa had been detained for questioning. Frank said Tuesday on MSNBC, as reported by Mediaite, that the bombing attacks at the Boston Marathon showed that Republicans' calls for tax cuts could hinder the federal government's responses to terror attacks and other tragedies that local governments aren't equipped to handle on their own. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Frank complained that conservatives 'criticize government, belittle public employees [and] talk about their pensions' without noting the work government can't do unless taxes are high . In his first statement Monday after . the bombings that killed three people and wounded at least 173, . President Barack Obama said partisan rancor should be left behind as . Americans came to grips with the horror and the carnage. 'I've . updated leaders of Congress in both parties,' Obama said, 'and we . reaffirmed that on days like this there are no Republicans or Democrats . -- we are Americans, united in concern for our fellow citizens.' But the 73-year-old Frank, no longer a member of Congress since his retirement in January, never got the memo. 'Part of the answer' to the question . of how to make Bostonians feel safe again, he said, 'is, and I have to . repeat this: Maybe we'll resist this [idea of] ""Oh, let's have less . government. Let's reduce the resources.""' 'No, . let's continue to build up security,' Frank argued. “And then, by the . way, as a practical matter this is very expensive for the city of . Boston. ... I hope that we will be able to find some revenue so that . Boston doesn’t have to pay for this absolutely necessary expenditure.' MSNBC anchor Thomas Roberts . challenged Frank, asking him, 'Do you feel like you're capitalizing and . making political hay of this event that happened ... that you're making a . political argument about revenue right now?' 'Yes! Exactly! I'm talking common sense!' Frank responded. Barney Fran was one of the liberal lions of the U.S. House of Representatives until his 2013 retirement. The only openly gay congressman during his tenure, he was seen as a reliable vote for left-wing social causes and liberal tax policy . Right-wing firebrand Steve King of Iowa said the Senate should scrap plans to provide conditional amnesty to illegal immigrants, given the possibility that the Boston attacks were carried out by foreign nationals. King is among the most reliably conservative members of Congress . 'I'm saying that if the sequester had gone through,' Frank continued, 'and we had not had enough money, we couldn’t be able to do this. Yeah, I'm making an argument about reality, and that’s the only responsible response.' Frank added that he hoped some people - referring to those on the political right - would be 'less enthusiastic about reducing our ability to respond to a crisis like this.' Also on Tuesday, Frank told CNN anchor John Berman that Americans should be 'grateful that we had a well-funded, functioning government.' 'It is very fashionable in America, and has been for some time, to criticize government, belittle public employees, talk about their pensions, talk about what people think is their excessive health care. Here we saw government ... perform very well.. 'You know,' he added, 'I never was, as a member of Congress, one of the cheerleaders for less government, lower taxes.' 'No tax cut would have helped us deal with this, or will help us recover. This is very expensive.' On the other side of the political aisle, ideological worlds away, Steve King told National Review that Congress shouldn't rush immigration reform legislation because the government doesn't yet know if foreign national weer involved in the Boston bombings. 'Some of the speculation that has come out is that yes, it was a foreign national and, speculating here, that it was potentially a person on a student visa,' King said. 'If that's the case, then we need to take a look at the big picture.' A Saudi student was initially reported to be a detained suspect, but authorities subsequently ruled him out, noting that a Boston bystander had tackled him to the ground for merely acting 'suspiciously.' King favors the border security portion of legislation reportedly finalized Monday by the so-called 'Gang Of Eight' in the U.S. Senate. But a plan to provide illegal immigrants with a path to citizenship, he said, should be delayed at a minimum. 'We need to be ever vigilant,' he told reporter Robert Costa. 'We need to go far deeper into our border crossings. ... If we can’t background-check people that are coming from Saudi Arabia, how do we think we are going to background check the 11 to 20 million people that are here from who knows where?' Senate leaders will introduce their bill on April 19, after Boston attacks forced the postponement of an event originally scheduled for April 16. King leads a group of Republicans who have said they will try to block Senate-originated immigration legislation in the House.","Right-winger wants to ice Senate talk of citizenship pathway for illegal immigrants, citing Saudi student now ruled out as a bombing suspect .

A British oil worker who spent a terrifying 48 hour ordeal at the hands of kidnappers in Indonesia, fought back the tears as he told how his captors let him go because his Indonesian wife could not afford their £300,000 ransom demand. Engineer Malcolm Primrose, 61, who was found yesterday in a palm oil plantation, said he had feared he was never going to see his wife and family again. 'Excuse me if I am a little bit . emotional,' Mr Primrose as he sat with his wife Nurasiah at the police . station in Parsi Putih village in the northern province of East Aceh.

'I can only thank God that everything turned out all right.' Still in his blue work overalls and a . traditional patterned Indonesian scarf which his wife gave him on his . return, the drilling supervisor said he was thankful his captor's 'did . not hurt me in any way'. The Scotsman admitted he had been afraid but 'they didn't hurt me, they fed me.' He said that when they released him, the abductors showed him the way to an area where he was later picked up by police.

Press conference: A 'shaken' but unharmed Malcolm Primrose sits with his wife Inur at police headquarters in East Aceh, Indonesia today . His wife told how the kidnappers had . called her to demand the ransom but when negotiations broke down the men . gave up and released her husband later. It is believed the kidnappers are former fighters from Ache's three-decade separatist struggle, a conflict which ended in 2005. Safe and well: Oil worker Malcolm Primrose, 61, has been found in Indonesia after being kidnapped by gunman who wanted £320,000 . Mr Primrose, who works for an Indonesian . company in the northern province of Aceh, was snatched by the armed . group on Tuesday when they ambushed his car as he was heading home. The kidnappers tied up his driver and drove off with Mr Primrose. A huge manhunt was launched, but police conceded the Scotsman could have been held prisoner anywhere in the jungle region of the province. They anticipated a long-drawn out search - but were surprised when he was found at a security post in a palm oil plantation early today. He told police that he was 'a bit shaken' but it is understood he did not need hospital treatment.Police Senior Commander Muhajir told the Jakarta Globe: 'We're taking him to Ranto Panjang police station to be questioned.' Police have yet to release details of how and when the kidnappers made contact with Mr Primrose's family, but it is believed that the Scot had, under pressure, given them details of someone to call. 'When they (the kidnappers) contacted his family, they asked for a 5 billion rupiah ransom,' said Commander Muhajir, who uses only one name. But the police officer said no ransom was paid and, expecting a long drawn out period of negotiation, searching officers and troops were surprised to hear he had been found at a security post. Investigation: An Indonesian policeman walks past a car used by Malcolm Primrose who was kidnapped in Peureulak, East Aceh . Hunt: Armed police went out in several vehicles to try to find the missing Briton yesterday . It was not known if he was released or had escaped from his captors but first reports said police believe they had decided to let him go. 'I don't know of a precise reason for the kidnappers' decision to release Mr Primrose,' said Commander Muhajir. 'It's probably because of the size of the police operation with the help of soldiers,' he said. The search operation had involved more than 100 police officers as well as soldiers. The safe return of Mr Primrose does not put an end to the search for the kidnappers. 'We are still looking for them and will keep up the pressure until we find them,' said Commander Muhajir. 'It is very rare for people to be kidnapped in Aceh these days,' he added. Scene: Mr Primrose was kidnapped in Indonesia's Aceh province by at least six armed men, police said . Relief: Police and troops had spread out in the region but there was no sign of Mr Primrose or his attackers until earlier today . 'We have had our very serious troubles in the past, as well as the terrible tsunami in 2004, but things have settled down a lot in recent years. 'We were very surprised to hear that a foreigner had been kidnapped, but it is good news we have got him back.' Mr Primrose is expected to spend several hours being questioned by police about his ordeal before he meets with British Embassy officials who have been sent to the area to assist in the search and now to debrief him. The British Embassy in Jakarta said that it was grateful for the work put in by the Indonesian authorities in searching for Mr Primrose. 'We are delighted to confirm that Malcolm Primrose has been released,' the Embassy said in a statement. 'Embassy officials are with Mr Primrose and are providing consular assistance. 'We would like to place on record our warm thanks for the support we have received from the Indonesian authorities, as well as from the Governor of Aceh and his staff, the Chief of Aceh police and his team, and the many others who have worked so hard to secure his release.'

Three of the six independent advisers to Lord Justice Leveson warned him not to consider compulsory state regulation of the Press, it emerged last night. Shami Chakrabarti, director of the civil rights group Liberty, said she had serious concerns about the idea floated by the judge to force newspapers to sign up to a new regulator by law if they refused to do so voluntarily. Miss Chakrabarti, one of six . independent ‘assessors’ advising Lord Justice Leveson on the inquiry, . warned that the proposal would be illegal under human rights laws. Warnings: Liberty director Shami Chakrabarti say imposing statutory regulations of the media would be illegal . Last night it emerged that two other advisers had also urged against even considering the route of compulsory regulation. A footnote to the 2,000-page report . reveals that former Channel Four News political editor Elinor Goodman . and former Daily Telegraph political editor George Jones both told the . judge it was unnecessary to consider compulsory state regulation of the . Press, as editors would sign up voluntarily to a tough new independent . regulator. Lord . Justice Leveson did not formally recommend compulsory regulation, but . suggested it should be considered if newspapers refused to sign up to . independent regulation. Miss . Chakrabarti said she accepted his main findings  but warned the . nuclear  option of compulsory regulation could breach the Human Rights . Act. She told the Mail on Sunday: ‘A . compulsory statute to regulate media ethics in the way the report . suggests would violate the Act, and I cannot support it. It would mean . the Press was being coerced in being held to higher standards than . anyone else, and this would be unlawful.’ Unnecessary law: Two of Lord Justice Leveson's advisors - George Jones, far left, and Elinor Goodman, far right, said the press would sign up willingly, eliminating the need for a law . Not recommended: Lord Justice Leveson did not advise compulsory regulation, but suggested it should be considered if media outlets would not sign up on their own accord . In a separate interview with the BBC . Miss Chakrabarti said she did not want to go beyond the ‘carrots and . sticks’ proposed in the report that meant newspapers which signed up to a . new watchdog would be subject to lower penalties when they got things . wrong compared with those that did not. ‘The . bombshell, or the difference, is what do you do if people don’t join . the club or don’t set up a club? Leveson doesn’t want compulsory . regulation of the Press, but he says if they don’t play ball, . politicians may have to consider it. That is where I get off the bus,’ she said. Chancellor George Osborne said Miss . Chakrabarti ‘spoke very powerfully about the risks of legislation’ and . urged the Press to ‘get on’ with setting up a new watchdog. But shadow . culture secretary Harriet Harman claimed Miss Chakrabarti was ‘wrong’ to . suggest that compulsory regulation would be illegal. Head to head: Labour's Harriet Harman wants . compulsory regulation of the press whilst Chancellor George Osborne supported Miss Chakrabarti and urged the . Press to set up its own independent regulator . In a footnote to his report, Lord Justice Leveson recorded: ‘Shami Chakrabarti advised against the contemplation of any element of compulsory backstop standards regulation of the press in the event of the inability or unwillingness of the press to implement the recommendations. 'She would prefer in that event to see a strengthening of the financial assistance available to those who feel their rights have been abused by the press in order to help them defend those rights in court.’ Lord Justice Leveson’s proposals would involve a major change in the law which would give the broadcasting watchdog Ofcom a legal duty to oversee the activity of a new ‘independent’ Press regulator. Critics fear this could lead to state interference by the back door as Ofcom’s chairman is appointed by ministers and the watchdog has sweeping powers to revoke the licences of errant broadcasters. In a statement last night, Liberty confirmed that it had concerns about the role proposed for Ofcom, adding: ‘Liberty would rather leave the question of whether the tests are met to the courts and not involve a quango which is ultimately appointed by politicians.’","Shami Chakrabati says law forcing papers to sign up to regulator is illegal .

A British tourist faced paying one of Britain's biggest-ever phone bills after thieves stole his mobile and used a sophisticated scam to rack up £15,000 in just two hours. Mike Clear was pick-pocketed in a Spanish resort and criminals used his number to repeatedly call a premium rate number charging up to £21 per minute. Trading Standards believe the phone number the criminals dialled was connected to their bank account, which was then pumped full of cash. Frightening: Mike Clear, 34, from east London, ended up with a mobile . phone bill of almost £15 000, after his phone was stolen whilst on . holiday in Spain . Mr Clear says his iPhone was protected by a code, suggesting that the criminals used software to hack his number and use it to make thousands of pounds when it was taken on April 23. Experts in Britain have told MailOnline it appears to be one of the rarest and most lucrative scams they have ever seen. Jaw-dropping: Mr Clear's monthly bill rose from £100 to £14,780, which shows the long list of calls to a premium number every 20 seconds . For ten days after his trip to Alicante, Mr Clear, who is an advertising executive from London, was told his April bill of £14,780.13 would have to come from his own pocket. It would usually have been have been around £100. O2 has now agreed to wipe the debt, and the father-of-one wants his terrifying experience to be a warning to others. 'I've been losing sleep over it. I've just moved and we have a young child. I cannot afford £15,000. 'What I didn't appreciate until now . was that SIM card fraud is as profitable for thieves as credit card . fraud.

'We carry our phones round and don't really consider that they offer thieves a direct route to our bank accounts.

"By . Lydia Slater . PUBLISHED: . 16:47 EST, 12 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:47 EST, 12 June 2013 . Slim hope: Lydia with her Malory band . On my birthday, my mother cooked me a celebratory dinner. The highlight was my favourite fish pie. A wantonly gorgeous creation made with lashings of cream, it's a dish I'd argue my mother is the best at cooking, probably in the whole world. Politeness as well as greed demanded I do full justice to her efforts; but as I reached out for a second helping - homing in on the lovely crispy, cheesy bits around the edges - an ominous tightness in my stomach warned me to put my plate down immediately. My new weight-loss aid was making its presence felt again. From surgery to drugs to smart bracelets which monitor calorie intake and output, the scientific solutions for tackling obesity seem to get ever more complex. Which makes it all the more surprising that the latest weight-loss wonder to capture the public imagination is very little more than a piece of string. The Malory Band is a woven polyester cord that you wear around your waist. Eat too much at one sitting, and the cord digs into your stomach. And that's basically it. At £39.95, it isn't cheap. The woman behind it, TV presenter and life coach Penny Mallory, calls it 'your best friend if you want to change the way you eat and exercise'. And, amazingly, it's proved a smash-hit. The bands have been flying off the shelves in more than 100 countries after receiving worldwide attention from the Press. Online forums are now filled with women praising its simplicity and miraculous effects on their waistlines. A similar technique was said to have been used in Egyptian times, and our Victorian great-grandmothers also apparently tied cords around their waists to keep track of their tums. So is it, literally, just money for old rope? Or is there method behind the apparent madness? Having tried innumerable weight-loss regimes, the simplicity of this solution really appealed to me. No banned foods, no mandatory exercise, no need even for willpower: it just relies on inflicting mild discomfort to discourage overeating. It would be like having a gastric band, but without any risk of post-operative complications. My waist measurement is 75cm, so I ordered a Malory Band in a size 10-14. It measured just under 90cm, and looked like a rather sophisticated belly chain. In plaited grey and white cord, it has loops along its length and silver stops at either end. You fit the cord around your waist, then push the stop through the loop to keep it at the desired circumference. It's invisible, except when worn under the tightest of body-con dresses (which you probably won't be wearing if you think you need a Malory Band.) I tied it so that it sat comfortably around my muffin top and went to show it to my husband. 'Hell-o!' he said in his best Leslie Phillips manner. 'I like it!' He's never said that about any of my control-top knickers. I think he liked the belly-dancer look. At first, the band and I got along fine. When I went to my fitness class at the gym, I was briefly aware of the metal ends knocking against my hip before I forgot about it. 'The band wasn't so much a . best friend as an ill-informed dietitian who disapproved of whatever I . chose to put into my mouth - however healthy it might be. And . my reaction to this constant nagging was to eat more.' I showered with it on - it dried quickly - but afterwards, getting dressed, I became aware of some rather strange looks from my fellow gym-bunnies. Either they were all aware of the Malory Band and were checking out how effective it was, or I looked as though I was working the belly-dancer vibe too hard for a women-only changing room on a rainy Monday morning. Afterwards, I decided it was time to set the band a test, so I popped into a café for a cappuccino and a croissant. As I munched, I waited tensely for something to happen. But my waistband felt as loose as ever, which perversely made me feel as though I was still being healthy. Lunch was a different story. I made myself a large but blameless broccoli salad, but as my stomach filled up, the band began to make its presence felt. Clearly, the fibre in the raw veg was making me bloat. I now realised that the low-tech qualities of the Malory Band obviously had their limitations; if I'd eaten a chocolate bar instead I'd have taken in far more empty calories without discomfort. The band also appeared to have issues with my posture. Returning to my desk to work, I found I had to sit bolt upright to prevent it digging in. By the time I went to bed, I had an unflattering red line etched into my stomach. I slept in it, and had wild nightmares of being trapped somewhere. At 4am, waking in a rage, I took it off and flung it to the floor. Jumping on the Malory band wagon: A mistake . The next day, I reluctantly put it on again. My stomach had slimmed down overnight. Once again, it felt comfortable (although I'd lost track of my original waist measurement). But by the end of the day, I had to loosen it once more. There were interesting aspects to wearing the Malory Band. Now I know which foods make me bloat: pasta, apples and broccoli were particular culprits. I made a mental note to avoid eating any of them before a party. Otherwise, the band wasn't so much a best friend as an ill-informed dietitian who disapproved of whatever I chose to put into my mouth - however healthy it might be. And my reaction to this constant nagging was to eat more, just to prove I was in charge of my body, and hadn't handed over control to this bossy piece of string. So when it started to bite into me at my birthday dinner, it was the final straw. I took it off with a sense of enormous relief. Which is possibly why, when I stepped on the scales after a week of wearing the Malory Band, I discovered to my dismay that I'd actually put on 1lb. In the longer term, I can see how wearing the band might work. Numerous scientific studies have proved that waist measurement is an important indicator of health. And if you've reached your target weight and are determined to stay there, that constant reminder not to eat another mouthful might be very helpful. But my personality doesn't work like that. I hate being niggled at, and my waist size seems to fluctuate quite significantly over the course of a normal day, whatever I'm eating. And as the band made me feel permanently fat and rather glum, I found myself reaching for the consoling biscuits rather more than I usually do. The technique might have worked for the Egyptians and the Victorians, but personally I'm still putting my faith in science rather than string. maloryband.com .","The Malory band is a polyester cord worn around your waist .

Chris Christie says no one will be getting naked when Prince Harry visits New Jersey in May. A listener asked Christie on a radio call-in show Monday if there are any plans to make sure the prince behaves. Christie says he'll be with Harry the entire time and that Queen Elizabeth II knows she can trust her grandson with the governor of New Jersey. No nudity: Gov. Chris Christie has promised to keep an eye on Prince Harry to ensure there will be no mad antics when he visits the state in May . On his last U.S. visit, the third-in-line to the British throne was caught frolicking in the nude with a woman in Las Vegas after an alleged game of strip billiards. The governor says lots of young people make mistakes. Christie, speaking on TownSquare Media's ‘Ask the Governor’ program, says he's thrilled the prince wants to see the damage caused by Superstorm Sandy and be helpful. The 28-year-old prince will visit Washington, Denver, Colorado Springs, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut in a week-long trip which he hopes will highlight the work of his charities, particularly those supporting injured servicemen and women. He will also be on official business on behalf of the British Government, helping to promote trade, commerce and tourism abroad. Naughty prince: On his last trip to America, Prince Harry visited Las Vegas for a scandalous lads' holiday which ended in tabloid headlines . Christie will be showing the prince the damage caused by Superstorm Sandy, as he did with President Obama . Harry is still living down his last trip to the US, last August, . when he enjoyed a ‘lads’ holiday’ in Las Vegas and was photographed . naked playing a game of ‘strip billiards’ with a party of women in his . £5,000-a-night hotel suite. He has refused to apologise publicly for his antics, which caused huge embarrassment to the Royal Family, but has admitted that he let them down. But last year he also completed his first, hugely successful, official solo royal tour to the Caribbean and Brazil, where he won admiration for his warmth and enthusiasm, dancing in the streets with locals and doing his best to race Usain Bolt, the fastest man on Earth. According to sources, Harry, who recently returned from four months in Afghanistan as an Apache attack helicopter pilot, will undertake this latest trip in his own ‘indomitable style’. It is sure to be a draw for royal fans as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who are expecting their first child in July, will not travel abroad this year, palace sources have confirmed. Prince's cause: The 28-year-old Royal will also play in a polo tournament on behalf of Sentebale, the organisation he personally set up to help Aids orphans in Lesotho which he visited last month . Harry’s trip begins in Washington DC . on May 9 with a visit to an exhibition on Capitol Hill to publicise the . work of landmine clearance charity HALO trust. He will also make a pilgrimage to the Arlington National Cemetery and aides have not ruled out a meeting with President Obama. The main focus of the trip, however, . will be the 2013 Warrior Games in Colorado Springs which will see more . than 200 wounded servicemen, including a 35-strong British team, compete . in seven sports. Harry will then fly on to New Jersey . to visit an area affected by last year’s Hurricane Sandy and carry out . several engagements in New York.

"By . Emily Allen . UPDATED: . 06:18 EST, 23 February 2012 . A mother and son have been jailed after they imprisoned two dogs in an attic and nailed it shut. Rottweiler Axel and Staffordshire bull terrier Bully were starved and denied water and exercise for weeks before they died in agony, emaciated and dehydrated, a court heard. Jamie Taylor, 31, and his mother Julie, 50, were each jailed for 16 weeks and disqualified from keeping animals for life after causing 'horrendous suffering' to the pets. Caged: Julie Taylor and her son Jamie (right) were jailed for 16 weeks for allowing their two dogs to starve to death at their Bradford home . The pair ignored the dogs' barks for . help and jobless Jamie refused to walk them because he was 'embarrassed' that they were too skinny. RSPCA . officers tried to rescue the animals but were denied access and when . police finally broke into the house in Bradford, West Yorkshire, they . found an 'overpowering stench' of rotten flesh and the maggot infested . corpses of the dogs in the attic. Jailing the Taylors, bench chairman Harry Atkinson told them: 'The dogs experienced horrendous suffering before their death. Rottweiler Axel and Staffordshire bull terrier Bully were starved and . denied water and exercise for weeks (file pictures of the two breeds . pictured) 'The dogs were prisoners upstairs in the house and they died from prolonged neglect. 'They had no access to the rest of the house, nor to the outside world. 'Mr Taylor said he would be embarrassed to take his dogs outside because they were too skinny to be seen out walking.' Both pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to the dogs and failing to keep them in a suitable environment. Jamie also admitted failing to exercise reasonable care and supervision. Prosecutor for the RSPCA Nigel Monaghan . told Bradford Magistrates' Court that the charity organisation had been . contacted by members of the public concerned about the care of the . Rottweiler and staffy, but when an inspector called at the house Mrs . Taylor denied access and claimed her son, the dogs' owner, was not . there. Convicted: The Bradford house where Julie Taylor and her son Jamie locked up their starving dogs . RSPCA inspectors called several times at the house over the following weeks but Mrs Taylor failed to alert them to Bully and Axel's condition, said Mr Monaghan, who apologised to the bench for the graphic nature of the photographs he passed them showing the condition in which the dead dogs were found. Police kicked down slats nailed to the attic door preventing the dogs escaping, the court heard. 'It is difficult to think of a worse case of animal cruelty than this,' said Mr Monaghan. 'A board of slats was nailed in place to stop the dogs, which were in the attic, from getting out and going down the stairs.' When RSPCA officers were granted access the decomposing and maggot-ridden bodies of the dogs were found in an attic full of faeces, with plastic sheets instead of bedding, and empty food and water bowls. A vet concluded they had died from starvation and hydration and had been 'ravenously' hungry and thirsty. An American bulldog called Buster was living downstairs in the house, which was well fed and exercised - he is now in the care of the RSPCA. The Taylors claimed Axel and Bully weren't allowed downstairs because Buster fought with them. Both Taylors, who were each on income support and incapacity benefit, would not take the imprisoned dogs for walks and 'ignored their barks', said Mr Monaghan. 'They thought nothing of the dogs starving to death upstairs. 'Jamie said he couldn't take them out because they were too skinny and he didn't want to be seen taking them out.' The RSPCA asked for costs of £1,333 to be paid, but because neither Taylor was working the magistrates awarded no costs or fines. Both Taylors wept as their solicitor Ian Hudson explained Jamie had asked to keep the dogs at his mum's home because his girlfriend didn't like the animals. But he failed to uphold his promise to feed, water and walk the pets, who he had owned for five years, and she did not enter the nailed-shut attic. Speaking after the hearing RSPCA inspector Dave Holgate said: 'Walking up the stairs to the attic room, where these dogs had starved to death, the smell was atrocious. I don't know how anyone was able to live at the property. It was indescribable. 'Jamie Taylor and Julie Taylor both knew the dogs were in there. They most likely heard them barking but decided, for whatever reason, not to feed them. When the dogs finally died, they could certainly smell them but left them to rot.'","Jamie Taylor and mother Julie ignored the dogs' barks .

Cheap supermarket sausages can give shoppers 'more banger for their buck' compared to big brands costing much more, it is claimed. A study by consumer experts at Which? found the Sainsbury’s Basics range pack of pork sausages contains 42per cent meat, which is the same as Richmond thick pork sausages. However, the big brand version costs three times more at £2.40 versus just 80p. Bang out of order: Sainsbury's Basics sausages for 80p contain the same amount of meat as Richmond thick sausages, which is three times as expensive at £2.40 . Which? also found that a shopper prepared to pay £2.99 for a pack of Sainsbury’ s premium range pork sausages – 59p more than the Richmond brand - would get 97per cent meat. Researchers also found a similar pattern with burgers, which are particularly popular as the country enters the barbecue season. Meat feast: Sainsbury's premium range sausages for £2.99 contain 97 per cent meat at only 59p more than the big brand . For example, Birds Eye Original beef burgers cost £8.30 per kg yet only contain 77per cent meat, while Tesco’s quarter pound beef burgers are 90per cent beef and cost £6.12 per kg. The recent horsemeat food fraud scandal has turned the spotlight on just what goes in to the nation’s processed meat products, with many people changing their diets. At the same time, some eight in ten shoppers now check the ingredients in the hope of getting some reassurance on the ingredients. Currently, there are strict rules . about what goes into a sausage or burger with minimum limits for meat . content to ensure shoppers are not misled. For example, anything claiming to be a pork sausage must be a minimum of 42per cent pork meat. Other . products can be called simply a ‘sausage’ if it contains at least 32per . cent pork, at least 30per beef or lamb, or at least 26per cent chicken. Despite . the recent horsemeat scandal, Which? complained that the UK government . is currently trying to push through a weakening of labelling rules, . which includes decriminalising food labelling violations. As a result, rogues who decided to con . the public with suspect food labels and ingredients will face much . weaker sanctions, if any. Not packing much: Birds Eye Original beef burgers contain 77per cent meat compared to Tesco's beef burgers' 90 per cent, yet is still £2.18 more per kg . Which? executive director, Richard Lloyd, said: ‘We want mislabelling to remain a criminal offence, even more so after the horsemeat scandal, so those responsible for misleading consumers can be held to account.’ He added: ‘Branded goods don’t always provide the best value for money, as we’ ve found shoppers can get more banger for their buck by choosing supermarket own-brand sausages. ‘It’s important that people know what they’re getting so they can make an informed choice. ‘In the wake of the horsemeat scandal, we want the Government to think again over their plans to decriminalise food labelling offences to help restore trust in the food industry.’","Supermarket's own products contain more meat than big brands'

A local party official for Italy's Northern League caused a national uproar for posting a violent comment on her Facebook page calling for the country's first black minister to be raped. Dolores Valandro, an elected local councilor in the northern city of Padua, wrote above a picture of African-born Integration Minister Cecile Kyenge that she should be raped. Valandro's comment was in reference to a story from an Italian web site called 'All the Crimes of Immigrants' about the alleged attempted rape of two women by an African man. 'Why does no one rape her, so she can understand what the victim of this atrocious crime felt? Shame on you!' Valandro wrote, in capital letters. Insulted: Cecile Kyenge, 48, who was born in Democratic Republic of Congo and moved to Italy when she was 18, said Dolores Valandro's words were an 'insult to all Italians' Her comment was quickly circulated and condemned on Facebook and Twitter, and the story shot to the top of news web sites. 'This type of language is beyond me because it incites violence, and it tries to incite violence by the general public,' the 48-year-old Kyenge, who was born in Democratic Republic of Congo and came to Italy when she was 18, replied on Twitter. Inciting violence: Valandro wrote above the picture of Kyenge on Facebook, 'Won't someone rape her, just to make her understand what victims of this terrible crime feel? For shame!' 'This is an insult to all Italians,' she added later. Prime Minister Enrico Letta joined scores of public figures in condemning the rape comment.

What's even worse is that it was a woman with a political role . suggesting rape as a punishment.' Northern League regional secretary Flavio Tosi said Valandro would be ejected from the party for her 'unspeakable' comment. After becoming minister in April, Kyenge has been regularly insulted on far-right web sites. Mario Borghezio, another Northern League member, was expelled from the Europe of Freedom and Democracy group in the European Parliament earlier this month for making racist remarks about Kyenge, including saying she wanted to impose Congo's 'tribal traditions' on Italy. Kyenge is campaigning to make it easier for immigrants to gain citizenship, and she backs a law that would automatically make anyone born on Italian soil a citizen.

Pensioners in their 60s and 70s have seen their incomes rise steadily during the recession years - and now they are less likely to be poor than any other group in society, according to a new report. By contrast young people in their 20s have suffered a major drop in their living standards since the onset of the downturn, and middle-earners among twentysomethings have lost the most, with a 12 per cent income fall. The analysis from the Institute for . Fiscal Studies comes in a week which has seen rising controversy over . the wealth and lifestyles of older people. All smiles: Older people are now less likely to be poor than any other group, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies . A senior Church of England cleric, Bishop of London the Right Reverend Richard Chartres, said the ‘fortunate generation’ in their 60s are soaking up too much taxpayers’ money and that state spending on older people ‘raises questions of intergenerational equity’. The bishop’s critics accuse him of ignoring the way the older generation have worked and saved for their lifestyles and of trying to create a divide between old and young. The IFS report said: ‘Differences between age groups are not new but reflect longer term trends. ‘Pensioners have consistently seen faster income growth than other family types and age groups over the past 30 years.’ Reasons for higher incomes among older people over the past three decades have included the spread of good occupational pensions during the 1960s, 70s and 80s, and the introduction of more generous means-tested benefits for low-income pensioners by the Labour government after 1997. Larger numbers of older people are also staying in jobs rather than taking retirement. Official figures this week showed that more than a million over-65s are now working, double the numbers of 20 years ago. ‘Individuals aged 60 or above are the only age group not to see real falls in median income since the recession,’ the report said, adding that incomes for older people have grown by between two and three per cent between 2007 and 2012. Since the late 1970s, it said, pensioner incomes have gone up at an average rate of about two per cent a year, double the rise enjoyed by working-age people. Age gap: The Institute for Fiscal Studies analysis showed how the over-65s are better off now than have ever been, while most other age groups have lower incomes than in 2007-08 and 2001-02 . Younger working people without children have seen incomes go up at only a third of the pace of the increasing wealth of older people. IFS economist David Phillips said: ‘This is in many ways a triumph of social policy. ‘But these figures also confirm that it is young people who have suffered most as a result of the recent recession and who are now at risk of falling further behind. ‘It is important that policymakers and politicians understand these profound changes to patterns of low incomes and respond accordingly.’ For people in their 20s, there was no real rise in incomes between 2001 and 2008, and a sharp drop during the recession years, the report said. It said young adults with jobs and no children lost out in the 80s and 90s as incomes rose for the best paid, and that from the late 1990s onwards ‘earnings growth was generally weak for this group right across the income distribution.’ Some politicians, including Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, have suggested that depressed wages for less skilled young people were at least in part a result of large-scale immigration that meant millions of newcomers to the country were competing for jobs. The IFS report, funded by the left-leaning research group the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, came on the day that official poverty figures showed that average incomes fell again last year. Income: This graph shows how from 1978 to 2008 almost every group saw their incomes increase, but only the over-60s have seen their earnings rise from 2007 to 2012 . A three per cent fall in average income in the year to last March - to £427 a week before housing costs are paid - was roughly the same drop as in the previous year. As a result real average incomes are at roughly the same level as 10 years ago. The across-the-board fall in earnings meant that poverty levels stayed the same when measured as ‘relative poverty’, the number of people living on incomes below 60 per cent of the average. But 900,000 people, including 300,000 children, fell below the 60 per cent line from the previous year after incomes are adjusted for inflation. This measure is known as ‘absolute poverty’. The Department for Work and Pensions said: ‘This was due to incomes not increasing as fast as inflation which was very high and is now coming down.’ Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said the previous Labour government had been ‘fixated’ by poverty lines and ‘despite paying out £170 billion in tax credits alone, they failed to meet their target to halve child poverty by 2010 and far too many children were left behind.’ He added that welfare reforms would cut real poverty by giving people incentives to get off benefits and take jobs. But Labour Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Liam Byrne said: ‘The devastating verdict is in - in just one year this Government has pushed a million people into absolute poverty and progress in tackling relative child poverty has completely stalled. ‘What these figures show is living standards are collapsing to their lowest level in a decade, and that is forcing an extra 300,000 children to grow up in absolute poverty.’","Over-60s have seen incomes rise steadily since start of the downturn .

Wayne Acott, 22, pictured, was jailed for five years after being found guilty of killing his baby son . A father who killed his baby son, inflicting injuries on him that are normally seen in car crash victims, has been jailed for just five years. Wayne Acott, 22, of, Maidstone, Kent, killed four-month-old Mackenzie after staying up late playing computer games at a neighbour’s flat. Detectives said Acott had a ‘momentary lapse of control’ at the time of the attack and had previously been described as a loving father. After returning from his neighbour’s home in the early hours, Acott’s partner woke him hours later, asking him to feed the baby while she dropped her daughter off at school. When she returned home and pulled into the parking bay on January 21 last year, Acott rang her mobile in a panicked state, saying Mackenzie had collapsed. As she ran into their flat, Acott was standing with the baby in his arms. She rang an ambulance and was told to perform CPR on Mackenzie as he had stopped breathing. The stricken baby was in a critical condition when he arrived at Maidstone Hospital, from where he was transferred to a special baby care unit at King’s College Hospital in London. He remained on life support for the following seven days but died from the trauma suffered to his head after failing to regain consciousness. Acott was jailed for five years at Maidstone Crown Court, pictured, for the manslaughter of his son . Doctors told the parents that Mackenzie’s injuries were like those normally seen in victims of a high-speed car accident, Kent Police said. A post-mortem examination found he had suffered a significant traumatic event such as an impact or impacts to his head or a shaking injury. Acott was charged with manslaughter on August 9 and pleaded not guilty on October 28. He was found guilty yesterday following a trial at Maidstone Crown Court which started on July 9, police said. Detective Inspector Trevor Fleming, from the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate, said afterwards: ‘It is very sad when such a young life is ended by a parent. ‘It is the case that many parents feel the strain of the early months of a new baby. ‘Unfortunately it would appear this young man had a momentary lapse of control. He had before that been described as a loving father. ‘A number of agencies are available to help new parents and they should not be afraid to ask for help.’","Injuries of the baby boy were likened to those of a car accident by doctors .

After deliberating for less than an hour, a jury in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, found a babysitter guilty for the first-degree murder of a toddler who was in her care. They suggested a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. The babysitter, 50-year-old Van Le, was tried for murdering 2-year-old Jessica Chau, the niece she had been babysitting for a year. Jessica died on September 24 after suffering for two days from injuries sustained under her aunt's watch. Le testified that she was only trying to revive Jessica, who was not feeling well and wasn't breathing. She picked her up, shook her, and put her on the floor 'very hard.' Guilty: Van Le leaving court Thursday after being found guilty of murdering her 2-year-old niece, Jessica Chau . 'I never hurt Jessica. I love Jessica,' Le said. But Le's testimony was countered with that of her 8-year-old son, who is now living with a foster family. He said his mother got angry with Jessica for jumping on the bed, so she grabbed the girl by the legs and slammed her head on the floor 'twice or several times.' The prosecutor acted this out for the jury, slamming a book and yelling 'quit jumping on the bed' to illustrate the force. Jessica was hospitalized for two days with a fractured skull and brain and eye injuries before dying on September 24. Mina Chau, Jessica's mother, had been leaving both Jessica and her 6-year-old daughter in the care of Le for about a year, while she worked at a nail salon. No more jumping on the bed: According to her son's testimony, Le was angry at Jessica for jumping on the bed when she grabbed the toddler by the legs and threw her on the ground multiple times . Jessica was 'playful' that morning, Chau testified, and had been riding a little pink bike before being dropped off at Le's house. Mugshot: Le will be sentenced by a judge on June 27. The jury recommended life in prison without parole . After the medical testimony, prosecutors say that Le changed her story to fit what doctor's said about Jessica's injury, something Assistant District Attorney Gayland Gieger believes attributed to the jury's speedy deliberation. 'I think the strength of the evidence is shown by the relatively short time the jury was out deliberating,' Gieger told NewsOK. 'She significantly changed her account of what happened after she heard the medical testimony. 'I think it's clear to all of us that she was lying to you,' Assistant District Attorney Marcy Fassio said in her closing argument. 'Clearly she has a motivation to lie to you.' Le will be sentenced on June 27.","50-year-old Van Le was found guilty of killing her niece 2-year-old Jessica Chau, who she had been babysitting for over a year .

A woman who claims she was raped by a Marine at the Capitol Hill barracks has waived her anonymity to speak out about her ordeal. Karalen Morthole, 23, said she thought she would be 'safe' among the marines during a party at the base following an Independence Day baseball game in Washington DC. She told NBC News: 'In my head, I thought these are people who are supposed to be protecting me.' Scroll down for video . Karalen Morthole told NBC that she thought she would be safe at the marine barracks at Capitol Hill . WATCH THE FULL INTERVIEW AT NBC.COM . Ms Morthole, a bartender who recently graduated from the capital's Catholic University, told the channel how she was socialising with friends at the Ugly Mug bar across the street from the barracks. A marine invited her to a party at a pub on the base, where she entered in the early hours of July 5 without needing to show I.D. Ms Molthole told NBC that the group drank 'a lot' of Irish whiskey shots and another marine became sexually aggressive. She says he pinned her against a wall, got close to her face and repeatedly told her: 'I'm going to [blank] you.' 'I was very scared,' she said. 'I can just remember being in excruciating pain and crying and asking him to stop.' Ms Molthole claims the alleged attacker, Master Sgt Ronald Bohlayer, tried to force her into a cab with him after he raped her, but she refused. Master Sgt Ronald Bohlayer is accused of raping Ms Morthole and faces a court martial . 'He got within six inches of my face and started . screaming obscenities at me, which prompted the guard I was standing . next to to hold up his arm and say, ""Stand down"",' she said. Ms Molthole said she visited hospital a week after the attack and reported the alleged assault to police a week later. This week, a Marine Corps general ordered that Bohlayer should be charged with rape, indecent exposure and disorderly conduct reports NBC News. Bohlayer denies the charges. Previously, a local prosecutor ruled that Bohlayer would not be charged because the evidence amounted to 'he said, she said', following her testimony to a grand jury. A previous Marines investigator said the allegations were 'baseless' and should be dismissed, but recommended bringing lesser charges against Bohlayer. The marine's lawyer, Major Joseph Grimm, claims the new charge is politically influenced by publicity around sexual assaults in the US military. The charge sheet against Bohlayer alleges that Ms . Morthole was 'incapable of . consenting . . . due to impairment by alcohol, and that her impairment . was known or reasonably should have been known by the accused.' The 22-year-old marine served in Iraq and was awarded the Bronze Star for his 2010 tour of duty in Afghanistan, his lawyer said. A Marine Corps spokesman would not . comment on the Bohlayer case, including the accusation from Major Grimm . that the case was being influenced by politics. Eugene Fidell, who teaches military law at Yale Law School, said it was rare for a senior authority to order charges to be brought when an investigator had recommended they be dismissed. He told NBC the Marine Corps general who ordered Bohlayer be charged, Major General Kessler, was navigating a 'minefield' in the wake of the case of James Wilkinson, whose conviction for sexual assault was overturned by an Air Force general. Bohlayer faces court martial on charges of rape, indecent exposure and disorderly conduct . This drew fire from members of Congress who said top military officials should not be allowed to make decisions in sexual assault cases. Mr Fidell said the Major General faced accusations of being unwilling to 'make the difficult decision' to send Bohlayer to trial if he had not ordered the court martial. The military law expert said Ms . Morthole's acknowledgement that she and her friends had been drinking . could help the prosecution to show she was unable to defend herself or . call for help. The issues surrounding sexual assault within the military are being examined by the Senate Armed Services Committee, which has been considering seven bills. The measures include one requiring a mandatory minimum sentence of two years in prison for a member of the armed services convicted of rape or sexual assault in a military court. Both the House and Senate appear determined to shake up the military's culture in ways that would ensure victims that if they report a crime, their allegations won't be discounted and their careers won't be jeopardized. The committee last week approved provisions in the defense bill that included stripping military commanders of the power to overturn convictions in rape and sexual assault cases. The panel also voted to require that anyone found guilty of a sex-related crime receive a punishment that includes, at a minimum, a dismissal from military service or a dishonorable discharge. The attack allegedly took place at the Marines Barracks in Washington DC . Officers, commissioned warrant officers, cadets and midshipmen convicted of rape, sexual assault, forcible sodomy or attempts to commit those offenses would be dismissed under a mandatory minimum sentence. Enlisted personnel and noncommissioned warrant officers convicted of similar crimes would be dishonorably discharged. In one hearing, Senator John McCain told the committee he could not advise women to join the military amid the widespread reports of sexual assaults within the armed forces. He also questioned what the impact of the crimes would be on both male and female recruits if the military did not tackle the problem. Senator McCain said: 'At its core, this is an issue about defending basic human rights but it's also a long-term threat to the strength of our military. 'We have to ask ourselves: if left uncorrected, what impact will this problem have on recruitment and retention of qualified men and women? ''I cannot overstate my disgust and disappointment over continued reports of sexual misconduct in our military. We’ve been talking about this issue for years and talk is insufficient.' The Pentagon estimated recently that as many as 26,000 military members may have been sexually assaulted last year, up from an estimated 19,000 assaults in 2011, based on an anonymous survey of military personnel. While the number of sexual assaults that members of the military actually reported rose 6 percent to 3,374 in 2012, thousands of victims were still unwilling to come forward despite new oversight and assistance programs aimed at curbing the crimes, the report said. There were nearly 800 reports of sexual assault cases in the Air Force last year, ranging from inappropriate touching to rape. That is a nearly 30 per cent increase from 2011, when 614 cases were reported. Many of those cases stem from a single base near San Antonio where dozens of young female recruits and airmen were victimized by their instructors. An inquiry into Lackland Air Force Base found that 32 military training instructors allegedly engaged in inappropriate or coercive sexual relationships with 59 recruits and airmen at Lackland, according to the Air Force. Six instructors have been convicted in courts-martial on charges ranging from adultery, rape and conducting unprofessional relationships. Nine more instructors are awaiting courts-martial. Two more received nonjudicial punishments. Fifteen 15 instructors remain under investigation.

Brilliant: alleged bank robber Maverick Madore's feeble attempt to escape authorities included RUNNING through the Lincoln Tunnel . Along with some cash, the teller at the Capital One handed Madore a dye pack that exploded when he passed a sensor in the banks entrance way.

Police hot on their trail, the pair's getaway car crashed on W. 31st street near the entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel. Rather than give himself up, Madore tried to ditch police by running through the tunnel towards New Jersey. Considering his escape plan included running through a tunnel that has only one way in and one way out - and he was on foot - it didn't take long for authorities to take him into custody.
